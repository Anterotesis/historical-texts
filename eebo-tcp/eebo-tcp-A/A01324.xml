            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Llen the Author of the Popish challenge (as it is now confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed) and of the Booke of Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie, as he alwayes acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, finding mine answere to both these treatises, so well grounded vpon the authoritie of the holy Scriptures, and testimonies of the most ancient writers, that albeit he might quarell at ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny bie matters, yet he was not able to auoyd the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of mine arguments, and answeres: determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned not to aduenture his credite, in publishing any replie vnder his owne name, and therefore turned ouer the businesse to one Bristowe, whose impudence being approued in his Motiues, and demaundes, was thought more meete to take so desperate a cause in hand. Bristowe himselfe on the otherside, perceiuing that it was impossible for him to make any shewe of replie, that might satisfie any meane witte, if hee should followe me orderly and directly, from point to point, as I haue followed Allen, durst not once vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake that lawfull course of replying, which I haue alwayes obserued in answering, but by confounding of many diuers matters together, hath sought to bring a great mist vpon the cause, vnder which hee might rather hide then defende his master Allen, and he himselfe like a pretie man, nowe and then start out and giue a perilous blowe, and so retyre into
<pb facs="tcp:13044:3"/>
his cloude againe. For this purpose it was not suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for him, leauing all order of replying, to take vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him the confutation of two books of myne, of most diuerse matters, in one of his, but that the confusion might bee greater, and the light of trueth appeare much lesser, he must defende two more of his owne. So that hauing nowe iumbled together no lesse then sixe treatises in one, two of Allens, two of mine, and two of his owne, he thinketh himselfe so well armed with darkenes and confusion, that if he cannot haue a conquest, yet he may be sure to haue a starting hole to hide himselfe in. And first he findeth great fault that his motiues and demaunds (which most men for the great follie shewed in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> dispised) were not first answered: dreming that my books should neuer haue beene put in print, but to make a shewe of answere to his motiues and demaunds. But how vainely he ges<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth, mine answere printed, to those wodden workes of his, doth plainely discouer. Of like vanitie and more impudence it is, that hee affirmeth constantly, that I was faigne to set foorth those bookes without priuiledge (albeit I say the one was authorized) distinguishing betweene priuiledge and authoritie, wherein I know not what the peeuish quareller mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth. For this I am sure, that both those bookes, had such approbation and license to be printed, as al bookes concerning religion ought to haue, by the Queenes iniunctions, which I call &amp; count a suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent authorizing. Concerning priuileging, I suppose Bristowe cauelleth, because he knoweth not what the name of a priuiledge signifieth, for which I will
<pb facs="tcp:13044:3"/>
remit him to some lawyer to learne. But where I affirmed, that my booke was authorised two yeares before it was imprinted, he douteth whether he may beleeue my bare word, because I write in the same, <hi>We beleue that the Catholike Church hath no cheefe gouernour vpon earth, but Christ, vnto whom all power is giuen in heauen &amp; in earth.</hi> But I pray thee Bristow, what doth this hinder thee to beleeue me vpon my bare word? Thou demandest a question in the margent, What if the Church were in England onely, or one were King of all Countries, sometime where it is? I might, according to Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons aduise, answere thee according to thy folly, &amp; deferre my resolution vntill either the Church be in England only: or that one were King of all Countries where it is. But lest thou shouldst thinke thy selfwise in thy folish question, I answere, that if either of both those cases should come to passe, which are both im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible: Christ should stil reteine his office and power that he hath in heauen and earth, and that one King of England, or of many cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tries, should haue no more authoritie ouer the Church, then the Queene of England now hath ouer that portion of the Church, that is in England, or ouer all those portions that are in other her seuerall dominions.</p>
            <p>But whereas Bristow saith, my former booke com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth forth only by permissio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to make a shew of some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what for a time, &amp; if after it chaunce of some Papist to be dasht out of countenance, then the shame to be no mans but onely Fulkes: I wish the gentle reader to consider two thinges. First, that he will charge no
<pb facs="tcp:13044:4"/>
man with the shame of mine errors, if any he can proue, but me onely, as in deede there is no reason that any man should beare the blame of my folly, but my selfe, &amp; least of al the church of God. Seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dly that by quarelling at the want of priuiledge and authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing of my writinges, he acknowledgeth this his owne booke of reply, to lacke neither priuiledge nor authoritie, so that if I not onely dash it out of counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunce, but also shewe it to be voyde of wisdome, learning and trueth, the shame shall not be priuate to Bristow alone, but co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon to all the popish faction beyond the sea, &amp; on this side the same, by whose co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon consent it seemeth to be penned and set foorth. Bristows reply is conteined in 13. Chapters, to euery of which, and to euery part of them, as they are inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled by himselfe, I will answere in order, that they which liste to conferre my Reioynder with his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, may see I seeke not by confusion to couer any fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shood, but by orderly proceeding to bring the trueth to light.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>That he confesseth the knowne Church of the first 600 yearès <note place="margin">Bristowe.</note> after Christ and the knowne members thereof.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>I beleeue that the Church of Christ, hath continued from the Apostles vnto this day, and shall doe from <note place="margin">Fulke.</note> henceforth to the ende of the worlde. And I do confesse that for 600. yeares and more, after Christ, the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of saluation in all necessarie articles was taught in the knowne and visible Church, although with all, in the later times, was receiued much corruption. I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge also the auncient writers, Bishops, Emperors and Monkes of those times, to haue beene members of the same visible Church. But whereas Bristowe saith, to that I adde of the late Emperors, I signifie that I meane the Emperors Constantine, Iouian, Valentinian, &amp;c. to haue beene such as I woulde wish for: I aunswere, he is no good interpreter of my meaning. For although in comparison of the later Emperors, they were much more excellent, yet I neuer ment to acknowledge them to be such, as I would wishe for: For both in the religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and in their manners, diuers thinges are founde, which I woulde wish had beene more agreeable to the worde of God, &amp; yet were they in their time, very god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and Christian Princes, holding the foundation of Christ. I hope, to their eternall saluation.</p>
               <p>Other bymatters there be in this Chapter, in which I am carped of Bristowe. First, that ignorantly I affirme, somewhere, namely Purg. 371. that the controuersie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twene the Britains and Saxons about the celebration of Easter, was the same, that was betweene Victor Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shoppe of Rome, and the Christians of Asia: whereas I saide, they defended a ceremonie receiued of the East Church, euen as the East church did long before against Victor <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>. of Rome: for they defende it by example and authoritie of S Iohn the Euangelist, Bed. hist. lib. 3. cap. 25. and so did the Asians, Euseb. lib. 5. Cap. 24.</p>

Secondly where I saye, that Athanasius and a fewe other, that were banished and persecuted, were the true Catholike Church: he noteth in the margent, <hi>such is his skill in the story of that time:</hi> Belike he is offended, that I say they were but a fewe, that tooke parte with Athanasius. How smal or great my skill is in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> storie of that time, Bristows practise of logike is but little, which remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breth not y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> many &amp; fewe are relatiues, and spoken in comparison: I say againe they were but few in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Arrians, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> tooke parte with Athanasius against his aduersaries, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he was banished. How many coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels helde the Arrians in the East against the trueth? The Emperor himselfe infected with the heresie: let the worlde iudge where the greater shewe of multitude was, with the Emperor, and with the councels; or with Athanasius and his fautors. Yea when Liberius Bishop of Rome in the West, had subscribed to the same here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie of the Arrians, &amp; Constantius after both his brethren were deade, ruled both in the East, and the West: what thinke you was the vaunting multitude of the Arrian faction, insulting against the true Christians, calling them heretikes, Homousians, Athanasians, &amp;c? <hi>Vincentius Lyrinensis</hi> saith: <hi>Arrianorum vene<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="3 letters">

               <p>Last of all, he saith I make a proper distribution, the Popes of all ages, to be theirs, and yet the Apostles and doctors to be mine. But he maketh an vnproper appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the name of Popes to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Bishops of Rome of al ages, where as a great number of the most auncient were godly men, and of true religion, members of the same Church wherof the Apostles and Doctors were, and not

               <p>I confesse indeede, that the Popish Church holdeth some errors, that were helde within the compasse of <note place="margin">Fulke.</note> 600. yeares, but them not verie many, nor the greatest controuersies, nor vniuersally helde in all that time, but in the later part of it onely, nor with such poyson of pernicious errors, as they are now holde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by the Papists.</p>

time of Montanus, haue bene infected with the error of praying for the deade, but none to bee shewed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him. The time of the first Nicen Councell (Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow saith) is inough for any Christian man. Who euer hearde such a blockish reason? If the Nicen Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel had decreed prayers for the dead to be vsed without the authoritie of the holy scriptures, it had not bene i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough for any Christian man to beleeue. The Nicen Councel made the Bishop of Alexandria equal with the Bishop of Rome, which the Papistes will not allowe. cap. 6. The same councel decreed, that men should stand and not kneele in publike prayers, yet is no man bound to this decree, neither doe the Papistes themselues ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue it. Cap. 20. But my ignorance is noted of Bristow, for saying that superstition was riper in the Latine Church, where the seate of Antichrist was appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to be set vp, not knowing that all the olde heresies, haue spronge of the Grekes: against whome were helde the first foure generall Councels. A pithie reason, shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no lesse Logike then knowledge of the Churche storie. Foure heresies were condemned by foure coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels, therefore all olde heresies sprong of the Grecians. But I will aske of Bristowe, whether Nouatus or No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uatianus captaine of the Nouatians, was of the Latine or Greeke Church? Iouinian &amp; Vigilantius are coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of him to be as great heretikes, as Arrius and Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donius, but whence did they spring, out of Greece or fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Latines? What shall I name the Donatistes, Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lagians, Celestians, Priscillianistes, al which sprange out of the Latine Church? And yet it is true, that Vincen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius affirmeth, that vntill the dayes of Stephanus, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shoppes of the Romaine Church, had alwayes earnestly defended the integritie of religion, once receiued, which he speaketh not as a singular prayse of that Church on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, for he saith of the same matter immediately before, <hi>Exemplis talibus plena sunt omnia,</hi> All places are full of such examples. And that which Bristow citeth out of Ruffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus in <hi>exp. Symb,</hi> that no heresie did spring at Rome, is to be vnderstode onely of such heresies as he speaketh
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:13044:9"/>
of before, against the danger of which, some clauses were added to the creede: For otherwise, Ruffinus could not forget what hee him selfe had translated out of Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sebius lib. 6. cap. 33. of Nouatus, which being a Priest of the Church of Rome, was author of the heresie of the Nouatians.</p>

               <p>I say the practise of prayer for the dead is not gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, <note place="margin">

                     </gap>Fulke.</note> because it is not to be founde in the most aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent times. Bristow asketh, if nothing be generall, but that I finde: as though he could find any thing, for 200<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yeares, but in Tertullian the Montanist. But the later practise for places he sayeth is generall: if I should vrge him to proue it, he could not do it. I confesse it was common, but for all the later time, it was not generall. The Waldenses, for 500. of the last yeares, practised it not, and almost in euery age, some are noted, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded it not, or denyed it.</p>

               </p>
               <p>I confesse, that some of the fathers referre the custom <note place="margin">Fulke.</note> of praying for the dead, to the Scriptures, and some to the tradition of the Apostles, but neither of both true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Bristowe compareth the case with fasting, wherof Augustine sayeth, that it is euidently commaunded in scripture, but the dayes not prescribed: So is prayer for the dead, but the dayes, times, and particular prayers, are referred to the tradition. I aunswere, when we see as good scripture for prayer for the dead, as wee see for fasting, we will say the cases are like.</p>
               <p>How Tertullian denyed, prayer and oblation for the dead to be taken out of the scriptures, is referred to the ninth Chapter, where it shall be answered.</p>
               <p>But he is fayne to denye (sayeth Bristowe) the most certeine workes of the Apostles schollers, Clemens Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manus,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:13044:9"/>
and Dionysius Areopagita, saying that we haue them of some counterfaiting knaue, &amp;c. (quoting for my saying) Pur. 268. which I desire the reader to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>use, and tell mee how honest a man he is, that chargeth a man to say of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> works of Clemens and Dionyse, that which I speake onely and expressely of the counterfeit epistles of Clemens.

               <p>I see no cause, why I should feare or bash to affirme, <note place="margin">Fulke.</note> that all errours came from the diuell, who is a lyer and the father of lyes: Neither is it any absurditie to saye, that the yerely oblations of thanksgiuing for the dead, are heathenish, as well as the oblations for the birthes. But it is an impudent slaunder, that he chargeth mine owne mouth to confesse, that the whore of Babylon is the church, at the farthest by S. Augustines time, which hath patched vp her purgatory, &amp; sacrifices for the dead: for purgatorie and sacrifice for the dead, was scarse hat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched in S.

               <p>Concerning the Popes primacy, he chargeth mee to teach, that the Church vanished quite away, vpon a sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, <note place="margin">Fulke.</note> when Phocas sold the primacie to Bonifacius, and yet no man then in the worlde, that went out from the Pope. The first point is a shamelesse slaunder, for I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer taught that the church vanished quite away: the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond is true, if it be rightly vnderstood: no man went from the Pope, as from a true member of the church, but the Pope rather went out of the church, into an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichristian tyrannie.

               <p>Now at length Bristowe alledgeth three causes of this his tedious rehearsall of my sayings: first, that the reader may see, in how many points we disse<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them, whome we confesse to haue bene of the true church. I answer, so long as we agree in the foundation, we are all of one church. The second cause, that the reader may see, I confesse the Papistes to agree with them of the true church, in the same. A great glorie, that you a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree with them in a fewe errors, and dissent in the most waightie matters of saluation. Thirdly, that I haue not, for these points, or any depe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding of these, iust cause to denye the Papists the true church &amp;c. If you erred onely in these points, as they did, holding all other trueth, which those auncient fathers helde, wee woulde no more deny you to be members of the true church, than wee do them: but seeing beside these errors, you hold many blasphemous heresies, which they neuer helde, and vtterly deny the office of Christ, the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our saluation, therefore wee iustly deny you to be of the true church of Christ. Neither is your excuse to be admitted, that you erre by authoritie of them, who if the trueth had bene as plainly reuealed vnto them, out of the scriptures, as it is to you, would neuer haue so obstinatly defended their errors, but as they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes

professed, yelded to the trueth, against custome, prescription of time, authoritie of councels, or any pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise whatsoeuer.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>First repeating my confessions: <hi>That the true church</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Fulke.</note> 
                  <hi>may erre, that it hath erred in some articles wherein we erre, &amp; in many other wherein we do not erre, wherof it followeth plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> (qd Bristowe) <hi>that neither our erring, nor these our errors, no nor any other our errors, are alone sufficient for him to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priue vs of the true church.</hi> Marke this consequens of Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowe,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:13044:11" rendition="simple:additions"/>
some errors which the Papistes, hold common with the olde church, cannot depriue them of the true church, <hi>ergo</hi> none other errors that they hold, contrary to the auncient church, are alone sufficient to depriue them. This is popish logike. And yet I will in this argument, charge his conscience rather then his science: for common sense abhorreth such reasoning, from the particular to the vniuersall.</p>
               <p>But let vs see, if such reason as alloweth the fathers to haue had the true church, notwithstanding their errors, may serue the Papistes to proue them the true church, their errors notwithstanding. The reason I alledge, that the fathers had the true church, is because they held the onely foundation Iesus Christ, and the article of iustification by the onely mercie of God. Now (sayth Bristowe) who knoweth not, that we beleeue in the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly sonne of God, and in the onely mercy of God, and that therefore wee looke not to be saued by our owne works, that is, which we did without him, in Paganisme, Iudaisme, or Caluinisme, in heresie or deadly sinne, &amp;c. but onely by his workes, that is, by his sacraments and the good deedes that of his great mercy, he hath crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in vs in Christ Iesus? &amp;c. therefore the same reason serueth vs, notwithstanding our errors.</p>
               <p>I answere, your minor is false: you beleue not in the onely begotten sonne of God, because you beleue not in God. Cyprian <hi>de duplici Martyrio,</hi> sayeth: <hi>Non credit in Deum, qui non in eo solo collocat totius foelicitatis suae fiduciam:</hi> He beleueth not in God, which placeth not in him alone the trust of all his felicitie. You place not your trust in God alone, for you trust in your merites, yea, in the merites of others, both liuing and dead, and in an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth things beside God alone. Secondly, where you say, you beleeue in the onely mercy of God, it is false: for you beleeue no iustification by the only mercy and grace of God, which excludeth all workes and merites, as the Apostle sayeth, Rom. 11. Thirdly, you says you beleue to be saued by his sacraments, which in deede af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a sort, are sayde to saue vs, namely, not as principal

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>seth to confirme his promises, which proceede of his onely grace and mercy. Fourthly you saye, you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue to be saued by those good deeds, that God of his mercy hath created in vs: which plainly declareth that you looke not to be saued, by the onely grace &amp; mercy of God, purchased by the redemption of Christ: but by such good workes as proceede from your selues, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though you ascribe vnto the grace of God, that you be able to do them, as both the Pharisee did, which iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied him selfe by his owne workes, and yet acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged God to be the author of them, in him, Luk. 18. And the Pelagians also affirmed generally, that by Gods grace we are saued, because God of his grace hath giuen such a lawe, by keeping whereof, wee might attaine to saluation.</p>
               <p>But you cite S. Paul, Tit. 3. to shewe, that his mercie &amp; sacrament may stande together, which no man denyeth: yet can you not shewe, that his mercie is so tyed to his sacrament, that he saueth not without it. For Abraham was iustified by faith, before he was circumcised, and receiued circumcision as a seale of the faith he had, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vncircumcised: Rom. 4.</p>
               <p>And where the Apostle speaketh of workes general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, excluding them from being cause of our saluation, you restreine the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> only to works done before baptisme: for this cursed glose you make vpon y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> text, Not for any workes of * righteousness which we did (before bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme say you) but for his mercie, hee hath saued vs by baptisme. But that S. Paul excludeth al maner of works, done by vs, from iustification, the sentence following declareth: That being iustified by his grace, we might be made heires according to the hope of eternall life. For grace and workes can neuer stande as a ioynt effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient cause, Rom. 11. but the one of necessitie, excludeth the other. As for the receiuing of the Sacramentes is no worke of ours, as you truely say, but an accepting of the grace, which God giueth. The place Ephes. 2. which you <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ite to proue, that we are saued by good workes, done
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:13044:12" rendition="simple:additions"/>
after baptisme, is cleane against you, if you had rehetsed the whole text. You are saued (saith S. Paul) by grace, through faith, (and this not of your selues, it is the gift of God) not of workes, least any man shoulde boast. For we are his workemanship, created in Christ Iesus vnto good works, which God hath prepared, that we should walke in them.</p>
               <p>The argument of S. Paul is taken out of the effect, Good workes are the effect and aide of our iustificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>ergo</hi> not the efficient cause thereof. And marke a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, that hee saith we are saued by grace and not of workes. Marke also the reason why we are not saued by any workes done by man: namely least any shoulde boast. For boasting of man, is not excluded, so long as any workes that he doth, may be the cause of his salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For if Abraham be iustified by workes, hee hath whereof to boast, but not with God: Rom. 4. where is then boasting? It is excluded. By what lawe? of works? No, but by the lawe of faith. Wherefore not onely the workes done before baptisme, but all other are exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from iustification, that no man should boast as the Pharisee, but that all glory of our saluation, might be ascribed wholy to God by Iesus Christ. You therefore building saluation vpon good workes, done after bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme, doe manifestly builde vpon another foundation, then the onely true foundation Iesus Christ: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, your errors notwithstanding, you cannot (as the olde fathers erring in small matters) be yet the church of God. What Flaccius Illyricus an intemperate man iudged of S. Hierom, I haue not to aunswere for him.</p>

A man were as good to reason with a poste, as with such a sensles Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pist: I say Caluin erreth not in such pointes, as hee is slaundered of by Allen, therefore I say he erreth not at al. I say and crie out as loude as I can, euery man erreth: and yet in Bristowes eares I say Caluin erreth not. The like zeale I shewe for Maister Iewel, whose learned la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours I commende to the iudgement of the world. And yet he hath quit himselfe so well (saith Bristowe) <hi>that the very reading of his aunswere, hath turned many earnest Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants, into earnest Catholikes, as both by the numbers, and by the noblenesse of the persons is notoriously knowne.</hi> I thinke the number and the nobilitie of the conuerts is all alike.

that he shoulde be so conuerted, if some popish treason discouered caused him not to faine such a souden and straunge conuersion.

Christes, and one of the Christs, they cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Crux, &amp;c. what say you Bristowe, speake they not a

worde, either of the figure, signe, or vse of the crosse? I coulde referre you to the 14. Chapter of Irenaeus, where he telleth that they call the Zodiak (whose mouing is ouerthwart the first mouing of heauen) an image of the crosse. And when they both tell you, that the crosse a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Valentinians, had a double vse of confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and separation, speake they not a worde of the vse of the crosse? No (say you) they inuented 30 gods cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Aeones, and among them diuerse Christs, wherof the crosse was one. It is a shame to lye on the diuell. The Valentinians did not call their Aeones goddes, but emissions of the first great inuisible &amp; infinite Acone. Neither was the crosse, any of those 30. Aeones, ages, or worldes. For they are all thirtie named in Irenaeus, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he cometh to the crosse: <hi>videlicet</hi> 8. of the first emissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, tenne of the seconde; and twelue of the thirde.

Vnto which they gaue diuerse names, calling it in a manner as you papists doe, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer, the sauior, the sanctifier, the apoynter of the bounds, the bringer vnto further matters, the most per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect ende or termination, &amp;c. But all this while, you wil say there is no mention of the figure of the crosse, but of a fained mysterie or imagination. Then you must vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand, that of these imagined mysteries, they affirmed there were sensible and materiall thinges in the world, made to be similitudes and images: Irenaeus. lib. 2. cap. 6. Such was the crosse y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Christ suffered vpon, and all other crosses made to the similitude of it, of which S. Paul by their fantasie shoulde say, God forbidde that I should reioyce but in the crosse of Christ, &amp;c. whose figures that they vsed in their consecration and baptizing, it may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare in Iren. lib. 1. cap. 18. where although the figure of the crosse be not named, yet their termes of redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, confirmation &amp; diuision which they vsed, in pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring on of water, annoynting them, doe infinyate, that they vsed some signes of the crosse to whome they gaue those titles, as before is shewed. Finally when it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tein
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:13044:14" rendition="simple:additions"/>
by Iren. lib. 2. cap. 6. that they affirmed those simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes and images in materiall thinges, were made vnto the honour of their inuisible and spirituall phantasies, there is no doubt but they had in great price the mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall image or signe of the crosse, for reuerence of that high mysterie whereof they dreamed the same to be an image or similitude.</p>
                  <p>Concerning the images of Iesus, which the Carpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cratians and other like heretikes made, and worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, Bristow sayth, it toucheth not the papistes, because they also made and worshipped the images of heathen Philosophers, like as the Samaritans ioyned the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipping of false Gods, with the worshipping of our Lorde. If I shoulde obiect vnto you, the worshipping of the images of saint Sonday, saint Hardhuffe, saint Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comber, yea saint Christopher, and saint George on horseback, which al were meere Idolls after your owne diffinition of Idols, I wote not howe you coulde quite your selfe, from the case of the Samaritanes. But Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeus and Epiphanius charge the heretikes, not onely for ioyning the images of Philosophers and Poets with the Image of Iesus, but also for fayning the Image of Iesus, and worshipping it. Irenaeus againste Basilides lib. 1. cap. 23. saith absolutly, <hi>Viuntur autem &amp; imaginibus &amp; inca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tationibus, &amp; invocationibus &amp;c.</hi> They vse images, and inchauntmentes, &amp; inuocations and all the rest of superstitions. Here he placeth the vse of ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges with inchauntementes, inuocation of spirites, and other superstitions of magike, and chapter 24. against the Gnostikes and Carpocratians he saith, <q>
                        <hi>Etiam imagines quasdam &amp;c.</hi> Also they haue certayne images painted, and some made of other matter, saying that the forme of Christ was made by Pilate, in y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> time which Iesus was with men.</q> If it had not beene a faulte to haue had these counterfete images, Irenaeus woulde not haue ioyned it amonge other hereticall practises of the Carpocra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians. The like sayth Epiphanius against Basilides and the Gnostikes, <q>
                        <hi>
                           <bibl>Haere. 24 </bibl>Habent imagines &amp;c.</hi> They haue images paynted in coulers, some also haue them of
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:13044:14"/>
golde and siluer and other matter, which they say, are the images of Iesus, and that these images of Iesus were made vnder Pontius Pilate, when he was conuersant a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongest men. And these images they haue closely. Moreouer they haue the images of certaine Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers &amp;c.</q> Who seeth not by this context, that Epiphani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us accompted it hereticall, to haue such images in any vse of religion, although they had not made any other images of philosophers besides? Also against the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyridians, which with certayne cakes offering as the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistes doe candles, worshipped the image of the virgin Marie: he asketh, what this desire of making images can be, else, but a deuilish enterprise? yet the Collyri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians worshipped no heathen Philosophers with the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin Marie. Neither doeth hee simply charge them that they worshipped her, as a God, but <q>

                  <p>You remember since the 3. chapter (sayth Bristow) by your owne report that the true Church counted Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilantius <note place="margin">Fulke.</note> an heretike for denying the inuocation of Sainctes, and the worshipping of their reliques. I aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I remember no such matter, neither do I finde any where, that Vigilantius was publikely condemned for an heretike, in his time, but onely in the priuate iudgement of Hierome, although Bernardus long after account him litle better. But of worshipping the reliques of Sainctes, and of their images, the case (say you) is all one: then by Hieromes iudgement, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of both is to be worshipped. <q>For wee worship not, sayth he, the reliques of Martyrs, no nor the sunne and Moone, no not Angelles and Archangels, Cherubim and Seraphim &amp;c: But we honor the reliques of the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs, that wee may worshippe him whose witnesses the martyrs are.</q> By which saying, and other to the same effecte, it is manifest, that although Hierome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended some honoring, or moderat reuere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of reliques, yet he abhorred idolatrous worshipping of them, and much more of their images. Where I say, the supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of reliques is receiued of the Ossenes: Bristowe sayth it perteyneth not to them, because the Ossenes worshipped them for Gods, whose reliques they had in such, estimation. But that is false: for they helde Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thys and Marthana for Sainctes, proceeding out of the holy seed of Elxai whom they neuer worshipped, but as a great Prophet and teacher, although Epiphanius saith <hi>pro diis adorabantur,</hi> they were worshipped as Gods: mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning that worship which is proper vnto God onely, was giuen to them, as it is of Papistes vnto sainctes, whome they worship as God, geuing that worshipp vnto them, which is proper onely vnto God, as faith &amp; inuocation. But Bristow would haue the snottie cloutes of Thomas Becket, that were worshipped after his death, to bee all
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:13044:15" rendition="simple:additions"/>
one with the napkins and partletts, that were caried fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the bodie of S. Paul the Apostle to cast out vncleane spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites, when hee liued: which napkins and partletts, yet he cannot proue either, that they were euer worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, or that they were reserued for reliques, after the worke of miracles was wrought by them. As for the argument that Chrysostome taketh, against the Pagans, of the reliques of Babylas the Martyr, which he would haue me to applie to my disease, was to the confusion of Idolatrie and sorcerie, not to the setting vp or main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyning thereof. And what worshippe I pray you, was giuen to the reliques of Babylas? If God shewed mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles by the presence of his bodie in Daphne, as by the bones of Elizeus, yet it followeth not, that his body or ashes, were worshipped more then the bones of Elizeus were.</p>
                  <p>Concerning inuocation of Angels, which they haue common with the Caianes, Bristowe sheweth, that the Caianes had other greater heresies, which the papistes holde not, as though those greater errors coulde excuse this lesser.</p>
                  <p>The superstition of Angels, that Saint Paul warneth the Ephesians, and Collossians to beware of, hee sayth, they be cleare of it, because in all their prayers, they conclude <hi>per Christum &amp;c.</hi> Through Christ our Lorde: as though they that taught the superstition of Angels, did cleane exclude Christ, or that it was to be doubted, lest the Ephesians and Collosians, would forsake Christ, and cleaue to Angels, but rather lest with the religion of Christ, as the cheefe, they woulde also admitte the superstition of the Angels, whereof were named the sect <hi>Angelici in Angelorum cultu inclinati,</hi> bowed downe in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> worship of Angels as S. Augustine saith, which there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore helde not the heade, because they worshipped not him alone, but ioyned Angels in part of his glorie. That Angels are ministring spirits, it proueth not, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they must be prayed vnto, but the contrarie, for inuocation is due onely to him on whome wee beleeue, which is God onely. So much the more blasphemous
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:13044:16"/>
is Bristowe, that chargeth Saint Iohn, Apoc. 1. to haue prayed to the Angels, where he sayth, Grace and peace bee to you from him, that is, and was, and is to come: and from the 7. spirites, that are before his throne, and from Iesus Christ. Whereas the consent of all aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent writers is, that the seuen spirites are taken for the holy Ghost, which is seuen folde in his graces, according to the prophecie of Isay 11. The spirite of the Lorde shall rest vppon him, the spirite of wisedome and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, the spirite of counsell and power, &amp;c. And it is also euident, that S. Iohn speaketh of the spirit of God as he was shewed to him in the vision, according to the dispensation of his manifolde giftes in the figure of the seuen lampes which are the 7. spirites of God ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the number of seuen Churches of Asia, to whome he sendeth the copie of his reuelation, for the instruction of all Churches in the worlde. Apoc. 4. And albeit wee shoulde expounde these seuen spirites for seuen Angels, as some late writers do, yet it followeth not, that S. Iohn shoulde pray vnto them, in those wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, but rather to God for their ministerie to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruation of the Churches: No more then if he shoulde wishe grace vnto them from heauen, it followeth that he prayeth vnto heauen. That phrase is often in the Psalmes, wherein saluation or helpe is prayed to bee sent from Sion, from the holy Hill, from the Temple, from heauen: and yet no man was so madde to say, that prayers was made to Sion, to the Hill, to the Temple, to heauen. And yet it is more monstrous, that hee char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth me to forget, that in the same booke of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calips, <hi>God doeth promise to make the obstinate Iewes to come, and to adore before the feete of one Angell.

                  <p>Bristow would haue the question of prescript fasting <note place="margin">Fulke.</note> dayes and abstinence from flesh to be all one, as they are accompted among the Papistes. But there is great difference. For Aerius which denyed fasting dayes ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by the church to be obserued, did neuerthelesse as Augustine sheweth out of Philaster, teach abstinence from flesh. Wherefore Bristowe falsely chargeth me to confesse, that the Papists haue the error of abstinence from flesh on fasting dayes, common with the auncient fathers of the primitiue churche. For on their prescript fasting dayes (except for necessitie) they did eate neither fish nor flesh, nor any thing vntill the euening. As for the abstinence from meates, against which Iouinian did teach, was but such particular abstinence as some men prescribed to them selues, not onely from fleshe, but also from fish and wine also, as appeareth by Hiero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyme, <q>
                        <hi>
                           <bibl>con. Iouin. lib. 2.</bibl> Nec hoc dicinius quòd negemus pisces, &amp;c.</hi> Neither say we this (sayth Hieronyme) that we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny fishes and the rest of meates, if a mans will may be taken in meate, but as wee preferre virginitie before
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:13044:17" rendition="simple:additions"/>
marriage, so fasting and the spirite, before fulnesse &amp; flesh.</q> Likewise, in diuers places, he speaketh of the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinence from wine. Furthermore, he chargeth me to bring no proofe of that I say, the fathers tooke prescript times of fasting and vnmeasurable extolling of sole life in the clergie, from the Tatianistes, Manichees; &amp; Montanistes. If I brought no proofe in that place, it was because I presupposed that Allen knewe, what Euse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius reporteth out of Apollonius, <hi>lib. 5. Cap.</hi> 18. That Montanus was the first that prescribed lawes of fasting. And that the Manichees in their electes, and the Tatia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistes in their perfectes, allowed not marriage, out of Epiphanius &amp; Augustine. But where I charge the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistes which Aerianisme for abstinence from flesh, Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowe sayeth, I take Richard for Robert, because the Aerians abstained from fleshe, as the Manichees, Tatia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistes, &amp; Montanistes, as perteining to the yll god, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the heresie of the Valentinians. Admit it were so, yet how ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> either Richard or Robert dischardg them selues of the doctrine of diuels and spirite of er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, whose fruite is forbidding of marrying &amp; eating of meates, 1. Tim. 4. which is hereticall and abhomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, for what cause of religion so euer it be? And seeing the Apostle chargeth them with hypocrisie, it is more probable that he speaketh against y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Papists, than against those open blasphemers. But howe proueth Bristowe, that the Aerians were of the opinion of the Eucratites or Apotastites? Forsooth, because Augustine sayeth: <q>
                        <hi>Qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam perhibent istos sicut Eucratitas vel Apotastitas, non admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tere ad communionem suam nisi continentes, &amp; eos qui seculo ita renuntiaverint, vt propria nulla possideant, ab es<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>a tamen car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium non eos abstinere dicit Epiphanius: Philaster verò &amp; hanc eis tribuit abstinentiam:</hi> Some say, that these men as the Eucratites or Apotastites do not admit into their societie, but onely such as conteine from marriage, and haue so renounced the world, that they possesse no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per goods, yet Epiphanius sayeth not, that they abstain from eating of flesh: but Philaster layeth to them also this abstinence.</q>

                     <pb n="25" facs="tcp:13044:17" rendition="simple:additions"/>
The similitude (which Bristowe by falsifying S. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine and displacing his wordes) would haue to be in the whole sect of the Eucratites, is onely in the absti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence from marriage and meates, and possessions, not in the opinion or cause for which they abstained. For seeing Aerius was an Arrian, he could not hold the plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralitie of Gods. For the Arrians so held the vnitie of the godhead, that they denyed the Trinitie of the persons in equall substance. And although he were the scholer of Eustachius, yet it followeth not y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he held all pointes as his maister did. Augustine chargeth him to haue ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded these matters of his owne. Beside that, diuerse of Eustachius articles differ little from the opinion of the Papists, concerning the marriage of priestes, and the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinence from meates, howsoeuer the papistes will not seeme to be so boysterous as Eustachius in denying the kingdome of heauen to them that marry, and hope to them that eate fleshe: yet Pope Syricius is affirmed to write, that they which be marryed be in the flesh, and cannot please God: <hi>Ep. ad Him. Tarrat.</hi> And what a daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous matter the Papistes count it, to eate flesh in tymes by them prohibited, all the world doth know.</p>

the mercie of God would haue to be free with moste fewe and manifest sacraments of celebrations, so that the condition of the Iewes is more tollerable, which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they haue not knowen the time of libertie, yet they are subiect to lawfull burthens, &amp; not to humaine presumptions.</q> But Bristowe proceedeth and vrgeth an other saying of Augustine, that if the whole church vse any thing, it is a point of most insolent madnesse to call in question, whether that should be so vsed. I answere, wee speake of approuing of vsages, not of any thing that is generally vsed. The church is S. Augustines time, approued diuerse vnprofitable vsages by secrete consent, without open abrogation, which yet were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerse in diuerse places.</p>
                  <p>Where I proue they were vnprofitable by this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, that many of them are abrogated, he answereth, that is no good argument, for there might be good cause to abrogate them, although they came of the tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the Apostles: as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> decree of not eating blood nor strangled, Act. 15. and the custome of the Apostles and of the churches of God for men to praye and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesie bareheaded. To the former decree I reply, that it was temporall, and not meant by the makers to be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall, but to beare with the infirmitie of the Iewes for a time. To the other custome of praying or prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching bareheaded, whatsoeuer the pompous doctors of the popish church obserue, I saye it is perpetually to be obserued for the distinction of the man and woman in couering and vncouering of the head, and the obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of naturall comlinesse in both, although for ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitie of health a nightcap, kercheffe or such like co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uering, according to the custome of the country, be not absolutely prohibited. As for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> forbidding of solemne fastes and genuflections on sundayes, which Bristowe sayeth was ordeined by the Apostles to plant the article of the resurrection, and more straitly obserued of the church against the Manichees, which might be abroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, nowe that article is receiued and the heresie extinct is but a dreame of his owne head without proofe, &amp; so

                     </gap>et it passe, although I knowe not what he meaneth to say, that forbidding of solemne kneeling is still obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued: for the papistes kneele as solemnely on sundayes as on other dayes. As for the libertie the church hath in altering of ceremonies, is neuer denied of me: but fond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly alledged of him, which pretendeth that traditions of the Apostles are as necessarily to be obserued, as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundements of the scripture, referring euery blynde ceremonie, whereof he knoweth none author, to tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Apostles.</p>
                  <p>Nowe concerning the Liturgies, he sayth, Proclus an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swereth why Basil &amp; Chrysostome changed the aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Liturgies that were before them: he sayth, forsooth they did but abridge and make shorter the Liturgie of S. Iames, which was too lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g for the peoples cold deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But his reason will soone proue all the three Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgies that nowe are called by the names of S. Iames, Basil, and Chrysostome, to be counterfeits, for ther is small difference in the length of them, and in a manner none at all. As for the Councell of Constantinople in Trullo, doth in deede name the Lyturgies of S. Iames, Basil, &amp; Chrysostome, but that proueth not these which we haue at this day, to be the same, seeing there are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest arguments to the contrary, as of the Monasteries spoken of in that which goeth vnder the name of Iames and of Alexius the Emperour, &amp; Nicholas the bishop, in Chrysostome, which were not borne many hundreth yeares after his death. But that prayers for the dead, were vsed in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ancient Liturgies, that were before Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostomes tyme, Bristowe sayeth he hath proued by plaine demonstration, Cap. 3. where there is nothing but a saying of Chrysostome cited by me, <q>
                        <bibl>
                           <hi>in Epist. ad Philip. Hom. 3 Non frustra, &amp;c.</hi>
                        </bibl> It hath not been in vaine decreed by the Apostles, that in the celebration of the holy my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries, memorie should be made of them that are hence departed, &amp;c.</q> This saying proueth a remembrance, but not a prayer, neuerthelesse of this remembrance v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in the elder times, they gathered prayers to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable. But more clearely, that it was a remembrance
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:13044:19"/>
without prayers, it appeareth by Epiphanius, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreteth the same remembrance to be as a prayer for the sinners, and for the righteous of all sortes to be a distinction of them from our sauiour Christ, <hi>cont. Aer. ser. 75.</hi>

                        <hi>Reliquas animas ad inferos deijciunt,</hi> the rest of the soules they cast downe into hell:</q> 3. What say you Bristowe, al the soules except Philosophers soules?

<pb n="30" facs="tcp:13044:20"/>
to the Stoikes) about the earth, which shoulde bee instructed of the wise soules. What was this, but a third place, and a place of purifying? But if you woulde haue your purgatorie more plainely described, you may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sort to Virgil, Aeneid. 6. where Anchises out of the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of Pythagoras, rehearseth howe the soules of good men are purged: <q>
                        <hi>Quin &amp; supremo cum lumine vita reliquit, &amp;c.</hi> After this life hath left them</q> (saith he) yet is not all euill, nor all the infections of the bodie departed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them, and it is necessarie that such things as haue beene long gathered together, shoulde by meruailous meanes be done away.

                  <p>Nowe concerning the three kindes of Purgatorie, which I saide that Carpocrates the heretike inuented, &amp; proued by the payment of the vttermost farthing, as the papists doe theirs: Bristow saith, by this argument, I wil winne much honestie, bicause the purgatorie that Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrates inuented, was a wallowing in all sinfull opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion &amp;c. What is that to mine honestie? I saide he inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a kinde of purgatorie, and Bristowe saith it was an absurde kinde of purgatorie. I said he proued his purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie as the papists doe theirs, but to that Bristowe aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swereth neuer a worde. But this is small honestie, for Bristow, that such things as are ioyned together by me, to shewe by what degrees popishe purgatorie came to perfection, they are seuered by him, as though I ment to charge the Papistes by such argumentes, to confute their purgatorie.</p>

but also about the purgation of such as dye in Gods fauour. Therefore Bristowe neede not gather mine ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, as he doth in scorne.

                  <head>Releeuing of the dead by prayer.</head>
                  <p>If the dead be not releeued, we say (quod Bristowe as S. Paul saith) they must indure a fierie and therefore a most painefull purgation. And for this saying, hee quoteth most impudently 1. Cor. 3. But I pray you Bristowe, where saith S. Paul the deade must endure a fierie purgation, or where maketh he any exception of their releeuing? Hee saith the fire shall trie euery mans worke. Is euery man onely some kinde of deade men? or is euerie mans worke the man him selfe? or is the triall of euerie mans worke of what sort it is, a purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion either of the man or of the worke? Arte thou not ashamed to charge S. Paul to say that, whereof hee saith nothing at all? euen by the iudgement of S. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine. But that Aerius was not the first that denyed prayers for the dead to be profitable, I shewed by that of the most auncient writers. The Heracleonits among other their heresies were charged to burye their dead w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> inuocations, and to redeem them with oyle, balme and water, and inuocations said ouer their heades, as Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine and Epiphanius shewe out of Irenaeus. Nowe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth Bristowe, and in many needelesse words, rehear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth other partes of their heresie, with their manner of
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:13044:21"/>
seasoning or receiuing those that beleeue in them, by a counterfait marriage and baptisme, and by anoynting with balme, &amp;c. concluding that this practise of theirs, maketh as much against true baptisme &amp; solemnizing of matrimony as against prayer for the dead, anealing, or anoynting, &amp;c. Likewise might they conclude, that all their ceremonies are as good as baptisme and mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage. But whatsoeuer wee reade of the practise of here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes, we must learne to distinguish that which is their owne inuention, from that which is the ordinance of God. And how shall wee knowe Gods ordinance from heretikes inuention, but by the holy scriptures? Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating therefore baptisme and marrying, which are the ordinance of God contained in the scriptures, from the rest that haue no ground in the same, prayers for the dead which they vsed with such like matters, were the inuention of heretikes. Howbeit (saith Bristowe) of prayer for the dead in all this was neuer a worde. No was? Howe read you Irenaeus lib. Cap. 18. out of which you cite so much &amp; could not see, that after he hath spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of their seasoning of their disciples aliue, he telleth how they redeeme them when they are dead: <q>
                        <hi>Alij sunt qui mortuis redimunt, &amp;c.</hi> Other there be, that redeeme the dead at the end of their departing, powring on their heads oyle &amp; water, or the foresaid oyntment, with wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and with the foresaid inuocations &amp;c?</q> Do you not heare the same prayers sayde by the heretikes for the dead, which they vttered before for the liuing?</p>
                  <p>But if the Heracleonites should faile mee, I affirme that Montanus had in all pointes the opinion of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistes, because Tertullian a Montanist vttereth al those pointes in such bookes as he made being a Montanist, and especially in his booke <hi>de anima.</hi> That Terrullian vttereth the opinion of the Papistes in all pointes, Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow wil not denye: But he asketh, whether all be Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanisme that Tertullian hath in that his booke <hi>de ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma,</hi> and in so many other bookes as he wrote being a Montanist? No forsooth sir. But Montanus the heretike helde whatsoeuer he wrote in those bookes. Howe
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:13044:22" rendition="simple:additions"/>
then shall we discerne that which is proper to Monta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus, from that which he hath common with the catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like church? I deliuered a rule euen nowe, concerning the practise of the Heracleonites. Prayer for the dead and Purgatorie are not found in the holy Scriptures, but they are found in a disciple of Montanus, therfore they stinke of Montanisme. Adde hereunto that in so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny bookes as Tertullian did write being a catholike, there is no mention of prayer for the dead, or suffering after this life of the faithfull. Last of all, Tertullian him selfe telleth you plainly, that Paracletus, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forter (by which he meant the spirite of Montanus) had reuealed very often, that euery small offence must be punished after this life, in that the soule of any except martyrs, shall not go immediatly into Paradise, but ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie in prison vntil it haue payde the vttermost farthing. What needed he to cite the authoritie of his Paracletus, if he had spoken nothing but that which was common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly receiued in the catholike Church? Which saying, sith I haue set downe in Tertullians wordes in the page of Purg. 417. by you quoted, you needed not to haue made a question, whether this opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> were Montanisme or no. But when you can saye nothing against this as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertion your selfe, you would make me vncertein of it, and say that it is but a light suspicion of mine, because in one place, before I come to the found proofe of it, I say it is a probable coniecture. And doeth it followe therefore, that I doubt of it, because I offer a probable coniecture to other mens vnderstanding, before by or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the discourse, I am brought to the manifest pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of it? The other phrases by which you gather a doubtfulnesse, shewe your ordinarie manner of colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions. <hi>And therefore it is not otherwise to be thought, but that the Montanistes added prayers for the spirites of them that were dead, &amp;c. Purg.</hi> 417. What vncerteintie is of that matter, whereof it is not otherwise to be thought? A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine: <hi>Finally, it appeareth, that the faithfull in Tertullians time allowed no prayers for the dead. Pur.</hi> 419.

                  <p>But for all your fine frumpe in the margent (all in Tertulian is Montanisme that Cyprian doth not men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) it is a probable coniecture, that prayer for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> dead, whereof Tertullian speaketh, was vsed onely in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenticles of Montanistes, because Cyprian which long after liued in Carthage, in all his workes, maketh no mention of prayers for the dead. But I weene Cyprian maketh expresse mention of prayers for the dead, by my confession, as Bristowe would haue men thinke, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I saye, of one place alledged by Allen, that it hath some couler for Purgatorie, which by flowe of argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments I easely washe of, that I neede not sticke in the lyme, as Bristowe sayeth I doe: but howe I am faste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned therein, he sayeth neuer a worde.</p>

He keepeth the feaste of his birthdaye in his garden.</q> Wherefore Pamelius, as great an antiquarie as you make him, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iustly reproueth Rhenanus, for vnderstanding <hi>natalitia</hi> in Tertullian, to be feastes of the birthdayes vsed after the example of the Gentiles. The places you cite out of Cyprian, speake neither of <hi>natales</hi> nor <hi>natalitia,</hi> but of celebrating oblations and sacrifices for the commemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration or remembrance of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Martyrs sufferings, which could be none other but sacrifices of thankesgiuing, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to your owne doctrine. Wherefore you shewe nothing to the contrary, but that Tertullian vsing the worde <hi>natalitia,</hi> vnderstandeth it for feastes of the birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daye, and not of the death of Martyrs. And beside the authoritie of Rhenanus and Tully, for the signification of the worde <hi>natalitia,</hi> I oppose against you these rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons. First, that he addeth not the name of Martyrs, as all they that vse <hi>natalitia</hi> or <hi>natales</hi> for the daye of their departure, but sayeth generally, <hi>pro natalitijs.</hi> Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that he spake immediatly before of oblations <hi>pro defunctis,</hi> for the dead, which you vnderstande for all faithfull departed out of the worlde: therefore <hi>pro na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talitijs,</hi> signifyeth the oblation for the birth of all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians come into the worlde. Thirdly, seeing he had before named oblations for the dead, it were absurde to vnderstand <hi>pro natalitijs</hi> for the dead also, without any more explication. Fourthly, if <hi>natalitia</hi> should signifie the feastes of the death of Martyrs (as you say,) it will followe also, which I do vrge of the place, that oblati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons <hi>pro defunctis</hi> for the dead, were but oblations of thankesgiuing as those for the death of Martyrs, which are conteined in one worde or phrase. As for that you adde out of Origen, <hi>in Iob. lib</hi> 3. Wee celebrate not
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:13044:23"/>
the daye of birth, &amp;c. But the daye of death, sheweth the custome of the Greeke Church, and not of the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine, and their celebrating of their daye of birth with ioye and thankesgiuing, as the daye of the beginning of felicitie, and ende of all sorrowes vnto the deade, cleane ouerthroweth your opinion of Purgatorie, and prayer for the dead, as in his time, not yet entred into the Greeke Church. Beside that, he speaketh of the death of all men, and not of Martyrs onely, as you violently would wrest him.</p>

                  <p>He maketh a foolish quarell vppon my saying, that George of Alexandria inuented beeres for lucres sake, as the Papistes their bearing clothes, and other toyes, for funerall pompe. And first he sayeth, that George did not inuent beeres. For Epiphanius sayeth, he deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to make the number of them certeine, and without those that he ordeined, no corps to be buryed, and all for lucres sake. Ep. H. 76. I neuer thought, that they carryed dead men on their neckes like beastes to the graue before Georges dayes, and therefore they had some kinde of comely carriage for them. But I sayed truely, that George inuented peculiar beeres, for lucres sake, as the Papistes vse their bearing clothes and like stuffe. Secondly he sayeth, I commend such ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies as are conuenient for laying vp of the corps.

                  </p>
                  <p>He demaundeth what a thing it is that I charge the Church in the Apostles time with heresies, that were in <note place="margin">Fulke.</note> the Apostles times, and the same Church in three Arrian Emperors times, with the heresie of Arrius? I answere that I neuer charged either the Apostles, or the faithfull members of the Church, or the true Church it selfe, with any heresies that were in their times. But aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swering the demaunde <hi>Ar.</hi> 15. what Church it was that hath alwayes stoode still and stedfast, while all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations of heretikes haue decayed: I say, <hi>The true Church of Christ hath alwayes stoode stedfast and inseparable from Christe her heade, when all heretikes haue beene and shall bee consounded, although shee haue not alwayes florished in worldly peace. For vntill the time of Constantine the great, the Church had small reste: And soone after vnder the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours Constantius, Constano, and Valens, it was greatly infected with the heresie of Arrius.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Where Bristowe falsifieth my wordes, reporting that I saye, The true Church was infected &amp;c. the name of the Church is oftentimes generally taken for the whole number of them that professe Christianitie, as when I saye, the Church was persecuted by the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Emperours, I meane all that woulde professe Christianitie, among whiche were manye heretikes that suffered persecution also. Lykewise when I say, the Church was infected, I meane the visible Church, in whiche are alwayes manye hypocrites, according to the parable of the nette and of the tares, &amp;c. yea
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:13044:24"/>
I doubt not but many of GODS electe, were infected with that heresie in those times, which after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde repented and returned to the knowledge of the trueth: wherfore my meaning was nothing lesse, then to charge the true Church of Orthodoxie and true professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with the heresie of Arrius, or any other which it did openly detest and abhorre.</p>
                  <p>An other quarel he hath against me, where I saide, <hi>Ar.</hi> 35. That the true Church decayed immediately after y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Apostles times. In which place, after I had shewed what corruption of doctrine had beene receiued of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> greatest lights and pillers of the Church, from which it was not like, that most of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> inferior members could bee free: I conclude according to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> demand (which was <hi>to declare by good history or reasonable likelyhood, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the true church did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caie?)</hi> that it decayed immediately after y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Apostles times, meaning as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> demaunde serueth also, to vnderstande the word of decaying, when it began to decay, &amp; not as Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow cauilleth, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it was vtterly decaied &amp; came to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, for such decaying I vtterly deny, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> euer it was, or euer shalbe. If we see some principall postes of an house, begin to putrifie, may wee not say, this building doth decaye? Or being asked when it decayed, after it is come to a more ruinous state, and yet standeth, may wee not aunswere, it decayed first, when such a beame or post began to put rifie? I doubt not but euery man of reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable vnderstanding, wil acknowledge how folish these cauils are, which are taken of ambiguitie of words, and misconstruing of phrases cleane contrarie to my mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, expressed in plaine euident tearmes, and hundreth times at least, in these my bookes, namely that the Church, although it be persecuted by tyrants, assaulted by heretikes, vndermined by hypocrites, enuyed and maligned by the diuell himselfe, yet the gates of hell shall neuer preuaile against it, to roote it out of the worlde, or to hinder the saluation of any one true member thereof.</p>

beholding of women: And therefore I doe not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisely charge Iustinus. And yet againe I say it seemeth, that the Church in his time was in some error, because Athenagoras a Christian philosopher, that liued in a manner in the same time, doth expresly call the seconde marriage <hi>speciosum adulterium,</hi> a faire kinde of adultery. <q>
                        <hi>Qui namque repudiauerit, inquit &amp;c.</hi> For hee that shall for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake his wife (saith Christ) and marry another, doth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit adulterie: suffering a man neither by diuorcement to put her away, whose flower of virginitie he hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed, nor to goe vnto seconde marriages. For he that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priueth him selfe of his former wife (although after she is deade a diuorcement is made) is a secrete and couered adulterer, transgressing the hand that is the creature or workemanshippe of God. Because in the beginning hee made one man and one woman, and dissoluing fleshe from flesh, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vnion of commixtion instituted for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipation of kinde and sexe, &amp;c.</q> And this seemeth to be the common error of his time, because he writeth this in that Apologie, which he made in defence of all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, which it is not like he woulde present to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror, in the name of them all, except he had written that, which was the common receiued opinion of the Christians doctrine in his time.</p>
                  <p>Concerning Hieronyme, Bristowe is angrie also that I say hee was almost falne into Tertullians error, when it is manifest hee was fayne to purge himselfe, not onelye against malicious enuiers, but also to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes Godly Bishoppes, and Christians. <hi>Apol. ad Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>machium.</hi>

cap. 23. confirmed by a generall councell, which is with the Papistes the Church representatiue, decreed, that the prayers at the altar shoulde bee directed alwayes to the father, which is no small error, seeing that hereof it followeth, that none ought to be directed either to the sonne or to the holy Ghost, or to the blessed Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. What moued those fathers thus to decree, I know not: but certayne it is, the decree is erronius and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fensiue. Bristowe cauelleth at my collections, as vnne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie, that no prayers may bee directed but to the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, whereas my wordes haue relation to such prayers as the councel speaketh off. Also that the verie prayers at the altar, may not be directed to the Sonne or to the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghost, because for orders sake, they are appointed to be directed to the father: I say, sauing the authoritie of the councell, which appointeth them to be directed to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> father alwaies, they may not, otherwise I doubt not but they may. And therefore Bristowe laboreth in vayne, to proue out of Fulgentius <hi>Ad Monimum, &amp; Petrum di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aconum,</hi> that the prayers, although they bee directed to the father, yet are made to the holy Trinitie, especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly because of the conclusion, which hath in it the name of the sonne and the holy Ghost. And whereas hee sendeth me to the Canon of his Masse for proofe of the same, I must put him in remembraunce, that in <hi>Agnus Dei, qui tollis peccata mundi,</hi> O lambe of GOD which takest away the sinnes of the worlde &amp;c: which is also sayde in his Masse, both the prayers is directed to God the sonne, &amp; yet no conclusion there is, naming the father and the holy Ghost. Let Bristow therefore choose, whether hee will defende the error of the councell of Carthage, or else acknowledge that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Romishe Church doth erre, in directing the prayer at the altar to the Sonne, without any conclusion including the father and the holy Ghost.</p>

But what if the councell of Trent doe not onely acknowledge it to bee an error, but also doe anathematise all them that holde the contrarie? Then haue I not slaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Papistes, but Bristowe hath slaundered mee. The verie wordes cited by Bristowe out of the 4. Cap. shewe that the Papistes helde it for an error, that it is necessarie for infantes to receiue the communion: That infantes lacking the vse of reason, are by no necessitie bound to the sacramentall receiuing of the Eucharist. Also the fourth Canon of the same session, thundereth out <hi>anathema,</hi> against them, that say otherwise. <q>
                        <hi>Si</hi>

                        <hi>quis dixerit parvulis antequam ad annos discretionis pervene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rint necessariam esse Eucharistiae communionem, Anathema sit:</hi> If any man shall say, that the communion of the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charist, is necessarie for infants, before they come to the yeares of discretion, let him be accursed.</q> But the same councel in the Chapter by Bristow cited, affirmeth, that Antiquitie is not to be condemned, if it practised that maner, sometime, in some places, and that without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouersie it must be beleeued, that they did it not, for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie necessitie of saluation. And this declaration (saith Bristow) may suffice not onely all Catholikes, to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it is the declaration of the holy Ghost himself, but also any other reasonable man. Indeede if any resonable man, wil be satisfied with such a grosse ledging of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whole mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in controuersie, it is a good satisfaction. The councel of Trent saith so, therefore although Augustine, Pope Innocentius, &amp; other witnesses of antiquitie say the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, of themselues, yet we must not beleue them. That Kemnitius a Lutheran toucheth not this error of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of Trent, it is a great argument, &amp; such as Bristowe often vseth, that it is no error. Kemnitius if he had beene as quicke eyed as Bernard, yet saw not all things, neither was he bound to confute all errors that he sawe. But for further satisfaction of all men, Bristow will open y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> case particularly, which is this in effect: The Pelagians af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, that children without baptisme, should haue e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlasting life, although not in the kingdome of God. Wherevnto the Catholikes replied, they could not haue eternall life, except they did eate the flesh of Christ, and drinke his bloud in the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion: but the communion they could not receiue, before they were baptised, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore without baptisme, they could not haue eternal life. Now Bristowe putting the case, that a childe were bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tised, and then immediately dyed before he receyued sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentally the Eucharist, demandeth, whether the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther granting to such a childe by force of baptisme re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of sinnes, do not also allowe him eternall life and the kingdome of God. <hi>And let any man</hi> (saith he) <hi>bring me one place of those Doctors speaking to this case &amp; holding the

                        <desc>•</desc>

                     </gap>n the worlde hath that argument of the Euchariste, for the necessitie of baptisme, if the Eucharist also bee not necessarie for children? For the Pelagians might reply, that if the Euchariste be not necessarie, no more is bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme for the atteyning of eternal life. But those fathers labored to prooue the necessitie of baptisme for infants, by the necessitie of the Euchariste for infantes: And this appeareth by many places of S. Augustine. As <hi>cont. Iul. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

For excepte they shall eate the fleshe of the sonne of man and drinke his bloud, they shall haue no life in themselues. But they which defend the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to haue this life without regeneratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, seeme to me that they would make frustrate baptisme it selfe, when they preach them to haue that which we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leue is not to be conferred vpon them but by baptisme

Or dare any man say this also, that this sentence pertayneth not to infantes, and that they may without the participation of this body and bloud, haue life in them &amp;c?</q> Likewise cap. 24. he saith, <q>
                        <hi>Optimè Puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ci &amp;c.</hi> Best of all, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Christians of Africa, do call baptisme it selfe nothing else but health, and the sacrament of the body of Christ, nothing else but life: Whence, but of an auncient (as I thinke) and apostolike tradition by which they holde it ingrafted vnto the Church of Christ, that without baptisme and participation of the Lordes table, no man at all can come, not onely, not to the kingdome of God, but neither to health &amp; life euerlasting? For this also the scripture testifieth accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to those thinges which wee haue sayde before. For what other thing doe they holde, which call baptisme by the name of health, but that which is sayde, hee hath saued vs by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> lauer of regeneration, and that which Peter saith, so also doeth baptisme in like manner saue
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:13044:30" rendition="simple:additions"/>
you? What other thing also doe they holde which call the sacrament of our Lordes table, life, but that which is saide, I am the breade of life, which came downe from heauen: and the breade which I will giue, is my fleshe, for the life of the worlde: And except ye shall eate the fleshe of the sonne of man and drinke his bloud, ye shall haue no life in you? If therefore as so many and so greate testimonies of GOD doe consent, that neither health nor life eternall without baptisme, and the body and bloud of our Lord is to be hoped to any body, in vaine without these is it promised to Infantes. Furthermore, if from health and life eternall, nothing but sinnes do separate, by these sacramentes, nothing but the guilt of sinne is loosed in infantes.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>These places of Augustine I haue rehearsed the more at large, that the impudencie of the councell of Trent and of their poore patrone Bristowe, might ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare, whiche would excuse the errour of the aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Churche, and of the Bishoppe of Rome in those times, in saying that albeit they vsed to minister the communion to infantes, yet they did it not for any necessitie to saluation: whereas the contrary by so many places, and more then I haue rehearsed, doth most mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festly appeare.</p>
                  <p>As for the practise whiche he confesseth of giuing that sacrament to infantes, he saith is not against <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet seipsum, &amp;c.</hi> Let a man examine himselfe, &amp;c. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause that infantes may examine them selues by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, (whiche is a monstrous kinde of speache) as well as beleeue and repent by others. Here is one er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of Augustine defended by an other of his: for infantes are not baptized for the faith of other men, but because they are comprehended within the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of GOD, to whome baptisme is no more to be denied, then circumcision was to the infantes of the Iewes. The Prophet sayeth, <hi>Iustus &amp;c.</hi> The righteous man shall liue by his owne faith.</p>
                  <p>It is not the faith of other men that can procure

life vnto vs. Neither is faith required of infantes, before they can heare the worde of God, which is the onely ordinary meanes by whiche faith commeth. But infantes (sayeth Bristowe) bee in no mortall sinnes, being newely baptized, and therefore they neede no examination for feare least they should come vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthily. Saint Augustine confesseth that hee was in mortall sinne, euen in his infancie: <hi>Imbecillitas mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brorum infantium innocens est, non animus infantium:</hi> The weakenesse of the members of infantes is innocent, not the minde of infantes. Afterwarde hee bringeth examples of enuie euen in an infant, and at last con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth: <q>
                        <hi>Quod si, &amp;c.</hi> And if it be so that I was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyued in iniquitie, and that in sinnes my mother in her wombe nourished me; where I beseech thee my GOD, when LORDE was I thy seruant, where or when was I innocent? By this you see, there is no shorte time of mans life free from sinne.</q> Neither may you cavill, that Augustine was not baptised in his infancie, seeing he speaketh generally of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of all infantes, which is not chaunged by bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme, although sinne be not imputed vnto them.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore to speake after your Popishe supposition of Baptisme, that by the worke wrought all sinne committed before baptisme, is abolished in baptisme; what if the infant not knowing the mysterie of bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme, be angry with them that haue taken him out of his warme clothes and plunged him in baptisme? is this no sinne? But what infant can examine him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe of this sinne? And what can the examination of other men profite him whome the holy Ghoste will haue to examine himselfe? As for the distinction of <hi>Votum explicitum &amp; implicitum,</hi> he sendeth vs to Allens booke de Euch. lib. 1. Cap. 31. &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>For how can we be assured, that children haue a close desire to baptisme more then to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion? Or how can it be proued, That they haue any desire explicite or implicite to either of both the sacramentes? If <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

and without all scriptures, wee may fill bookes with distinctions and deuises innumerable. Last of all, hee chargeth mee, with falsification by adding, because the councell of Trent saith, that manner was <hi>aliquan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do in quibusdam locis,</hi> some times and in some places. But I pray thee Bristowe, what haue I falsified? the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel of Trent, which thou affirmest that I did neuer read? Thou sayest they that did communicate infantes, were not so many, as Fulke doeth make them. Why, howe many doe I make them? I sayde that the Pope of Rome and all they that tooke his part in S. Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stines time, were in this error, that the sacrament of the bodie and bloude of Christ, was to bee ministred to infantes. And haue I not playnely, and now also plentifully prooued it out of Saint Augustine? where is then this falsification? If I had not prooued that which I sayde, yet there is difference betwixt falsifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and a false affirmation. And because the Tridentine councell sayth, it was <hi>Aliquando</hi> as though that error had not long continued, it is manifest that it began to bee ministred to infantes before Cyprians tyme, and continued fiue or sixe hundreth yeares after. Witnesse <hi>Beatus Rhenanus in Tertulli. de Coron. mil.</hi> where he sheweth that this manner was continued vntill the times of Ludouicus Pius, and Lotharius and after: citing these wordes out of the bookes of ceremonies called <hi>Agendae</hi> of infantes newely baptised. <hi>Si Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scopus &amp;c.</hi> If the Bishop be present, it must bee immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately confirmed and then communicated. If the Bishop bee not present, before the infante doe sucke or taste any thing, let the Prieste giue him the communion of the body and bloude of CHRIST, yea before the Masse, if necessitie require. By this Testimonie it appeareth not onely that this custome was long obserued, but also that it was ioyned with opinion of necessitie, so that masse should not be taried for, if the infant were in any danger.</p>

Now commeth Bristowe in this his balde and confusd reply, and as though I were able to note none errors of the Popish Church, but those which I note vpon such occasion, willeth all them that would know the true Church, to consider that these errors (if they bee any) are so fewe and so light, that they may bee a sure confirmation to Papistes, and a iust motiue to all other to embrace the Church of this time, no lesse then of olde time, considering it is no lesse, but much more vnreproueable of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> aduersarie. Neuertheles as few and as light as these errors seeme, they are sufficient if they were but one, to proue y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which I intend: namely that the Popishe Church hath erred, which being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the surest piller of Poperie is broken, and all the rest of their opinions which they holde against the scriptures, &amp; the true Church of God, when it is shewed that the popish Church hath erred, will shewe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues to bee errors, which had nothing else to gayne them credite, but this one false principle That the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pishe Church can not erre.</p>

But the trueth is (as may apeare to eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man that wil read the Councel, act. 5) that this is a vaine glosse of Bristow to elude the matter.

                        <hi>Sacra synodus dixit etiam domine:</hi> The holye synode sayde yea forsooth my lorde.</q> By this it is manifest, that not I, but Bristow hath misreported the matter. Where I sayde (If this be not to induce an errour to make men beleeue that angels and spirites haue bodies visible and circumscriptible, there was neuer any errour since the world began:) Bristowe pulleth me backe and saith, <hi>Soft man, other manner of errours haue beene defended since the world began.</hi> I wot well, &amp; greater, but if any of them be a manifest errour, this is as manifest as any of them all.

Pope: he sayeth more then he is able to warrant: for beside that D. Cole in his answere to the Bishop of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum manifestly defendeth the authoritie of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels against the Pope, many popish diuines were and are of that opinion, that the Pope may erre, and is vnder the authoritie of the councell.</p>
                  <p>But where I shewe a manifest errour in the popish church by the interchangeable condemning and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prouing one of another, of the Pope and the councell: Bristowe sayeth, the matter is not so vncerteine amon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest them, as I make it. For first he graunteth, that the councell of Ferrara and Florence, determined that the Pope was aboue the councell, and that the councell might erre, and that Pope Eugenius 4. was of the same iudgement. He graunteth also that the councels of Constance and Basil determined the contradictorie, namely that the councell was aboue the Pope, and that the Pope may erre. But where I sayde, that Martinus <hi>quintus,</hi> chosen Pope by the councell of Constance, was of the same iudgement, there he cryeth, <hi>hoe, you proue not that, nor neuer shall proue.</hi> No shal, Maister Bristow? why sir, is it like, that the councell which had deposed three Popes, would choose a fourth man Pope, that was of a contrary iudgement vnto them? Yea, how coulde he accept the Papacie, beeing not voide, if the councell had not authoritie to depose the Pope, whosoeuer hee was of the three, that was the right Pope. But seeing Iohn the 23. was of the Emperour and the councell ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted the right Pope, who also before his deposition, affirmed that the councell of Constance was a most ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly councell and could not erre: it is manifest, that this Martyn beeing a Cardinall, consented to the depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition of Iohn the 23. session. 12. therefore he was of the same iudgement that the councell was. But if you would saye, that as soone as he was made Pope, the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite of Peter comming vpon him, he was soudenly chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged into a contrary iudgement: his Epistle written to the inquisitors is plainly against you, where you saye, <hi>that at the petition of the Polonian Ambassadour, he confirmed

<pb n="64" facs="tcp:13044:37"/>
Bristowe woulde nowe seeme to make relation, I did accept. And first I proued that pope Innocent with S. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine and all the Westerne Church did falsely inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prete this scripture <hi>Ioan.</hi> 6. Except ye eate &amp;c. and that to maintaine a false opinion of the necessitie of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion for all persons, and euen infantes, that should haue life euerlasting, and therefore repugnant to right faith, as is more declared in the 2. part of this chapter.</p>
                  <p>Secondly I noted diuerse places of scripture, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly falsely but also ridiculously expou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded, in the second councell of Nice, to maintaine idolatrie against the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse commaundement of God, and therefore contrary to the right faith and the loue of God. Concerning these interpretations Bristow saith, that they are not the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretations of the councell (whose interpretation they are not bounde to defende, but onely their definitions) but they are the interpretations of particular persons. To this I answere, they are contained in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> synodal book sent into the Westerne Churches, to stirre them vp to idolatrie (which booke was aunswered by <hi>Carolus Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> or by <hi>Alcuinus</hi> at his commaundement, and in his name) therefore they are approued by the councell, yea some of them are contained also in that report of the councell, which is set downe in the bookes of councels. The text of lighting a candell, and putting it vnder a bushel, is affirmed of Bristowe to be well applyed in the Epistle of Constantinus, &amp; his mother to the synod. But he is deceiued. For there is no argument of setting of i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages vpon the altar drawne out of that text which is so abused in the Synodal aboue rehearsed, confirmed by <hi>Carolus</hi> or <hi>Alcuinus.</hi>

                  <p>The seconde text, God made man according to his image: therefore we must haue images in the Church: Bristowe confesseth to bee contained in the Epistle of pope Adrian to the Emperour. But the same is approued in the councell, and is the popes Epistle, whose credit is greater with you than the councels. But he doth not conclude (you say) that therfore we must haue images in the Church. What then? forsooth that <hi>a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Tha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rasius answered, that concerning the worshiping of ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, he did allow the Popes letters.

                  <p>The 3. text (As we haue heard, so we haue seene in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> citie of our God. ps. 48. to proue y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> God must not be knowne by onely hearing of his word, but also by sight of ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges:) Bristowe affirmeth that it is not the councell that citeth it, but a Deacon called Epiphanius, which readeth it to the councell out of a booke of his owne: I answere hee readeth it with approbation and good liking of the councell, which in effect is al one. But he citeth it not (saith Bristowe) to shew how God must be knowne, but about the storie of Christs manhoode, nor to proue im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the said story must be painted &amp;c. as though God can be knowne but by Christ, for knowledge of whom, by imagery, he cyteth this text of the Canticle also, Can. 2. shew me thy face, &amp; let me heare thy voyce.

                  <p>The 4. text falsely interpreted in sense, &amp; falsified in

Which text in the Councell of Lateran, holden vnder Pope In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent the thirde, is falsified in words after this manner. <hi>Pater quod dedit mihi maius est omnibus.</hi> That whiche the father hath giuen me is greater then all: and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted to proue the eternall begetting of Christ of the substance of his father.

Allens sense.</hi> What sense Allen hath of false interpretation, I knowe not, sure I am, that a text cannot be truely interpreted in sense, when it is corrupted in wordes, which make the sense. Secondly he saith y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> of my two crimes, I must strike out one: for sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing the text to be as the councell alledgeth it, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation is not vnapt. But I reply, supposing the text to be as it is in deede: Such falsifying or corrupting of the words must needes drawe with it not onely an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>apt but also a wrong interpretation. <hi>But what couler of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son haue you</hi> (saith he) <hi>that the councell hath falsified the words of that text? Is it not in the vulgar Latine translation verbatim, as the councell alledgeth it?</hi> yes verily. <hi>And so is the councell cleared of that crime also.</hi> Not so soone as you weene: for if any falsifying or corrupting of the words of the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, haue crept into your translation, it had beene the councels dutie, not to haue winked at it, if it could haue seene it, much lesse to haue confirmed it, so farre forth, as of so many texts which cleerely proue Christ to bee consubstantiall with his father, it coulde finde none, but take this corrupted and falsified text. <hi>But the most auncient Latine writers, saint Augustine, saint Ambrose, and saint Hilarie doe reade iumpe as we doe, saith Bristowe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That doth not amende the matter one whit, but sheweth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> errour of the Latine Church to haue the lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger continued, which in the councell of Lateran (if it could haue espied it) ought rather to haue bene refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med then confirmed. <hi>But will you chaunge your copie</hi> (saith Bristowe) <hi>and frame your accusation anewe against the trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation as differing from the Originall, that is from the Greeke?</hi> Sir I neede not chaunge my copie, for my accusation
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:13044:38"/>
is alreadie framed that this text is falsified and corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted contrarie to the originall trueth: yet Bristowe go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth on. <hi>But afore you doe so, take my counsaile with you, and bee sure first that the Greeke is so as you say. For some Greeke copies, of auncient also had euen as we haue: as namely, the copie which saint Cyrill, being a Greeke Doctor, expoundeth Cyr. lib. 7. in Ioan. cap.</hi> 10.</p>
                  <p>In deede it were not amisse, to take the councell of such a learned Grecian as Bristowe is, that I might bee sure howe the Greeke text is. For hee can tell me of auncient Greeke copies, yea namely of that which saint Cyrill a Greeke doctor did followe, and expounde, which agreeth with the vulgar translation in this text.</p>
                  <p>Verely the sight of such a copie woulde doe mee great pleasure. But vntill I may see it, I will suspende my iudgement, and in the meane time, I woulde bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe a worde or two with Thomas Stapleton the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>user and allower of this booke of Bristowe. I praye you sir, Haue you perused and allowed thi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

What els? doe you not see it printed in the first leafe, <hi>Perused and allowed by mee Thomas Stapleton?</hi> And are you so good a peruser and allower of bookes, Maister Stapleton, that you cannot espie in them Chalk taken for Cheese? Doe you not see your scholer Bristowe alledge saint Cyrill a Greeke doctor to proue the truth of the greeke text lib. 7. in Ioan cap. 10. and when all commeth to all, there is no such booke of Cyrill the auncient Greeke doctor extant, but it is poore Iodocus Clicthouius a late Latine writer, that hath supplyed those 4. bookes of Cyrill that are lost. Wherefore to returne to you M. Bristow except your councel be better and sauour more of good learning and knowledge, you may keepe it for your friendes. As for your assertion, without doubt that the copie which your authenticall translator followed, had euen as hee translated, helpeth you little or nothing: which if it were graunted, howe can you proue that hee translated it as you nowe reade it?</p>
                  <p>Seeing it is certainly knowne to them that haue confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red

his translation with the originall, that beside that in diuerse places he giueth not the true sense of the Greeke, in many texts also he is corrupted, where he had trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated right. Wherefore how fully I am aunswered on e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery side co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning this text as you boast in the end, let the readers iudge.</p>
                  <p>In y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> last place you set down my words <hi>Ar.</hi> 7. in which I accuse the Church of Rome for thrusting vpon vs that corrupt Latine translation, which all learned men doe know to be corrupt, in such texts as are the most coule<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable places for the defence of popish doctrine, of which I giue one example for all. <hi>They allege the text (1. Cor. 10. Qui stat, videat ne cadat: he that standeth, let him take heed<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>Bristowe biddeth mee looke better in the text, their translation is not as I charge it, but euen as I say the Greeke to be: <hi>Qui se existimat stare &amp;c:</hi> And therefore in the margent he biddeth, stand out of his light that the childe may see. Might not I say shore vp your eyes syr. Richarde, and see that I doe not say, the text is so transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, but so alledged. <hi>They alledge the text, Qui stat, videat ne cadat.</hi> And if you require mine author who allegeth it so: looke in Haymo vpon the verie place, and you shall finde these verie wordes. <hi>Qui stat in fide &amp; operibus, videat ne cadat:</hi> He that standeth in faith and workes, let him see y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he fal not. And if you woulde haue a later wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that so alledgeth it, looke in Gregory Martin one of your broode, who in his booke of schisme alleageth it in so many wordes: <hi>Qui stat, videat ne cadat,</hi> in the first chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of his booke.</p>
                  <p>And what hath brought them to this vnderstanding, but your corrupt translation? <hi>Qui se existimat star<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And if he had, how should wee knowe that Church that hath the same spirite, but by tryall of the scriptures, which were

vndoubtedly written by the same spirite. Bristow saith, the faithfull will no lesse beleeue the Church, at all times, for the same spirite, then the Apostles. He must first proue, the spirite so giuen to the Church, that shee can no more erre in her decrees, then the Apostles could in their writings. Secondly, if that were proued, the tryall of the Scriptures is necessary to discerne the true Church from all false congregations, which all boast of the spirite of trueth, as much as the true Church. And seeing the holy ghost by his instrument S.

I aunswere, the question of the meaning of the scriptures is needelesse in that controuersie: where some of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors confesse prayer for the dead not to be grounded on the Scriptures, other wrest the Scriptures so mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festly, that the Papistes them selues are ashamed to vse those textes for such purposes. This aunswere I trust, will satisfie reasonable men for that controuersie. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this, he sayeth, I count my selfe and my companions happie, for such blinde presumption, to search the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Scriptures, only out of the Scriptures, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mentaries of doctors, but as he troweth, not without the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mentaries of Caluine.

                  <p>Likewise, where I compare the whole heape of su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition &amp; errour, out of which Allen raiseth a mist of mens deuises to a dunghill: Bristowe noteth, that I make the doctors writings a dunghill. Surely what superstition or errour so euer be in the doctors, as the sweeping of a faire house, is meete to be cast on a dunghill. Let Bristowe or Allen, if he list, say there is no superstition or error in any of the doctors. And yet it followeth not, that the doctors writings are a dunghill, more then that a kings pallace is a dunghil, because the sweepings thereof are meete for the dunghill.</p>

Bristowe aunswereth, <hi>whosoeuer expoundeth the scripture vnto that wherein the doctors doe agree, shall bee euer most cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of trueth (which is inoughe) though not alwayes certain of that same verie places meaning.</hi> Wee are then much the neere, when the question is of the scriptures mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, if by the consent of the doctors, we cannot be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of the scriptures<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> meaning. And if that trueth (as we beleeue that all trueth) is in the scriptures, howe can we be certaine of the trueth by the agreement of the doctors, where we cannot be certain of the meaning of the scriptures?</p>
                  <p>Where I aunswere, that wee haue our measure of Gods spirite, as the doctors had, although wee agree not with them in all interpretations, euen as Cyprian and Cornelius, were both indued with Gods spirite, although they agreede not in exposition and iudgement of the scriptures: Bristowe replyeth, <hi>that Cyprian was of Cornelius his iudgement implicitè, though explicitè, hee were of an erronious iudgement.

Againe, Antichrist is hee, whosoeuer denyeth that Iesus is Christ: One certaine person onely denyeth not that Iesus is Christ: Therefore Antich rist is not one certaine person onely, 1. Iohan. 2. vers. 22. Againe, Euery spirite that confesseth not Iesus Christ to bee come in the fleshe, is the spirite of Antichrist: but this is not the spirite of one certaine person: <hi>ergo</hi> Antichrist is not one certaine person. The beast described Apocalips 13. and expounded Apocalips 17. is Antichrist, but manie kinges are the partes of that beaste, therefore An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist is no one certaine person. The whoore of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon whiche is expounded Apoc. 17. to be the citie of Rome, is borne by the beast beforesaide which is Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ, but the citie of Rome is not borne by one certayne person, therefore Antichrist is no one cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine person.</p>
                  <p>An other article that hee requireth me to proue is: That the Churches flying into the wildernesse, at the comming of Antichrist, is to become inuisible to the worlde: Although this article bee not a matter of faith, in controuersie betweene vs, neither yet so affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of mee, as though to bee in the wildernesse, were nothing else, but to bee inuisible to the worlde: yet I will proue so much as I affirmed, that the Church be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the wildernesse, is inuisible to the worlde. The Church being where the multitude of wicked men are not, is to them inuisible: But the multitude of wicked men are not in the wildernesse: Therefore the Church being in the wildernesse is to the multitude of wicked men which is the world, inuisible.</p>

               <p>The third text Gal. 1. which S. Paul spéaketh of prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, Bristow saith I alledge it of writing, &amp; of onely writing. In these words: Pur. 449. <hi>It vexeth you at the verie hart, that we require the authoritie of holy scriptures to confirme your doctrine, hauing a plaine co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement out of the word of God, that if any man teach otherwise the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the word of God allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, he is accursed?</hi> First he chargeth me w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> falsification by changing. But what change I haue made, let the Lorde God iudge. Indeed I haue drawne mine argument from the worde of God, to the holy scriptures, because they are y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> only certeine assurance of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> word of God. For how can I knowe certainely what S.

But nowe S. Paul saith not, that all good workes are taught by the scripture, saith Bristowe. <hi>Hee saith the scriptures are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable, he saith not, are able or sufficient to teach all good works. Againe he speaketh only of the worke of an Euangelist, and not of all good workes.</hi> To this I aunswere that immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly before Paul saide, The scriptures are able to make Timothie wise vnto saluation, through faith in Christ

Iesu: but no man can bee wise vnto saluation, but he y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> knoweth all good workes meete for a Christian man to doe: therefore all good workes meete for a Christian man to do, may be learned by the scripture. And euen in this very text, where he saith, Al the scripture inspired of God is profitable to teaching of trueth, to dispro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of falshoode, to correcting of vices, to instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting in righteousnes, that the man of God that is the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uangelist, be perfect, furnished to euerie good worke<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> although you restraine euerie worke to the only worke of an Euangelist, yet that I saide, is necessarily conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded thereof. For it is some part of an Euangelists worke to giue example in all good workes, that are meet to be done by other men: but by the scripture he may be perfectly furnished &amp;c. therefore all good workes are taught by the scripture. Againe, when all the office of an Euangelist, which consisteth in teaching, disputing, correcting, instructing in righteousnes, may be perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly furnisht at the scriptures: what can be more playne to prooue, that nothing ought to bee taught for truth, disprooued for error, corrected for vice, instructed for righteousnesse, but that which is taught, disproued, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected, instructed out of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> holy scriptures? Seeing ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that prayers and oblations are to be made for the dead, is not taught by the scripture, it is no trueth. To deny prayer to be profitable for the deade, is not dispro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by the scripture, therefore it is no error. To omit prayer for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> dead is not corrected in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> scripture, therfore it is no vice. Me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> are not instructed in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> scripture to pray for the dead, therefore it is no worke of righteousnes.</p>
               <p>The 5. &amp; 6. texts, I alledge together Pur. 434. Search the Scriptures, and trie the spirites, to proue that the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teintie of trueth in vnderstanding the Scriptures, is not to be had but by the spirite, and the spirites are not tried but by the Scriptures. Against this conference Bristow saieth, <hi>Who euer alledged Scripture more blindly?</hi> And why so I pray you? because Christ saieth in the same place, that Iohn did beare witnesse to the truth. My workes doe beare witnesse of me: Also, My father who hath

But if the testimonie of Iohn, of the workes of God the father, do all confirme the Scriptures, who euer alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged scripture more blindly then Bristow, to proue that Christ may not be learned sufficiently out of the newe Testament, &amp; the old, when Christ sendeth the Iewes to the old Testament, as a sufficient witnesse of him?</p>
               <p>Concerning the triall of spirits, Bristow biddeth me looke in the text: by this we knowe a spirit of trueth &amp; a spirite of error namely by hearing or not hearing of the Apostles. I like it very well. For where shall wee heare the Apostles speaking, but in their writings &amp; in the other holy writings, according to which they spake all, that they taught. Wherfore here is no tryall of the spirites, but by the scriptures. And where he sayeth the Romanes doe moste manifestly continue in that they heard of the Apostles, because no man can name y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> time, the noueltie, the seducer, that they went after, although it were true, that no man could in any point shew (as he sayeth) yet the argument is naught, seeing it is proued by the Apostles writings, that they holde many things, not onely beside, but also contrary to the doctrine of the Apostles.</p>

You shall not doe, sayth the Lorde, what seemeth good in your owne eyes, but that which I commaunde you, that onely shall you do without ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding any thing to it, or taking any thing away from it. After a fonde quarrell of the quotation omitted by the printer, and his coniecture thereupon: Moses sayeth not (saith Bristowe) That onely which I doe write, but that onely which I commaund. And so our sauiour Christe commaundeth the Iewes accordingly. The Scribes and Pharisees sit in Moses chaire: and therefore whatsoeuer they commaund you, obserue it.

And yet what more common in Poperye, then not onely to paint, but also to carue the images of kings, and noble mens armes, euen vpon the roodeloft of the Churches, where they were patrones? At last hee challengeth mee to ioyne with him vppon his last de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund, which is apostasie, vnto which I haue aunswered long since. Finally, he will discharge the Pope from being antichrist, by the commentarie which the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture it selfe makes. <q>The seuen heads are seuen hilles, vppon which the woman sitteth:</q> And they are seuen

                     </gap>ing kings, before the time when this was spoken. What then? <hi>One is presently,</hi> who therefore is ment of the Romane Emperors, and all other kings persecuting with them. The other is not yet come, and when he commeth, he must remaine a short season, who euident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is Antichrist in proper person.</p>
                  <p>This exposition hitherto may agree with the Pope: Nay (sayth Bristowe) for he must remaine not a long season, as the fiue, and as the one, but a short season, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly three yeares and an halfe. But where haue you the length of his continuance compared with the fiue and one? All the time of the Churches persecution is but short, in comparison of the infinite comfort, that she shal haue euerlastingly, though it be long in the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of fleshe and blood, measuring the time by the breuitie of mans life, and the seasons of this worlde, as Bristowe doeth the three yeares and an halfe. But this is worthie to be noted, that he expoundeth the sixt king for the whole state of Romane Emperors, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther persecuting kings, as he doeth the fiue kings that were past, and yet against all reason and analogie, wold haue the seuenth (which is antichrist) to be one singular man, so to auoide, that the whole rabble of Popes can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be antichrist. Nowe followeth the exposition of the tenne hornes, which are tenne kings, which haue not yet taken kingdome, but they shall take power as kinges euen in one houre with the beast, that is, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with Antichrist (sayth he) to serue him as his feede knights. I maruell whether he will not expound the houre in this place for the 24. part of a naturall daye. For otherwise wee see by histories, that the aduaunce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Pope, was the decay of the Empire in the West, and with him arose a multitude of kings in eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry prouince, which before were subiect to one Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And so you see euidently</hi> (sayth Bristowe) <hi>by these seuen hilles, thus expounded, that the woman which sitteth vpon them, is not so little a one, as you do make her, but that shee is Mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:13044:66"/>
impiorum: the whole worlde of wicked men.</hi> But where do we see this euident exposition of the seuen hilles? wee haue seene the exposition of the seuen heades, to bee seuen kings, and also seuen hills: but we see no exposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the hills, who must needs be taken in their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per sense, because they are the exposition of anothe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> figuratiue speach, namely seuen heades. But the woman (you say,) is no little one, which sitteth on the seuen hilles, but the worlde of wicked men. Let the holye ghost I pray you expounde the woman, as well as the heades of her beast. <q>And the woman which thou sawest is that great citie which hath the kingdome ouer the kinges of the earth.</q> This is a cleare exposition of the whore of Babylon, the woman; and as cleare a descripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the citie of Rome, which in that time, had the kingdome ouer the kinges of the earth, and is the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie builded vppon seuen hilles, before expounded to be one of the significations of the seuen heades, a perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuter of the sainctes vnder the Emperors, and a poisone<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The whore of Babylon is a great citie, hauing dominion ouer y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> kings of the earth: but the whole worlde of wicked men is not a great ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, hauing dominion ouer the kinges of the earth: ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the whore of Babylon is not the whole worlde of wicked men. Againe, The whore of Babylon is a citie situated vpon seuen hilles: The whole worlde of wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked men is not a citie situate vppon seuen hils: therefore the whore of Babylon is not the whole world of wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked men.</p>

                     </gap> aunswere, mine argument is apt and good to confute Allen, which citeth that place to prooue, that as immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate mourning, is against the hope of the resurrectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, so being ioyned with praiers and almes, it hath the liue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hope of life in those that sleepe in peace. This aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage Bristowe hath, by rending and tearing mine argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes from the bodie of my booke, that it cannot bee perceiued, vppon what ground I vse them. Neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse hauing often before in that aunswere to Allen, protested that hee coulde bring nothing out of the scriptures for allowing prayer for the deade, this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is to be referred to the same conclusion, after this manner. If in most conuenient place, the holy ghost <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>oyne not prayer and almes to moderate mourning for the departed, then doeth he ioyne them in no place: but in most co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uenient place he ioineth not: <hi>ergo</hi> in no place. The maior is prooued by the wisedome of Gods spirit, which alwayes choseth that which is most conuenient: the minor is manifest and granted: <hi>ergo</hi> the conclusion is true. But Bristowe asketh me if I preaching to mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate the mourning of the faithfull, vse none other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort then these two? I answere him concerning the state of the departed, I vse none other proper places of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort but these two, the hope of their glorious resurrection, &amp; their quiet rest in the meane time. But S. Paul, saith Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowe, <hi>speaketh nothing of their quiet rest after death, although he name them that are asleepe in the Lorde.</hi> If they sleepe in the Lord, they are not onely at rest, but in happinesse. Can you interprete to sleepe in the Lord, to be in hellish torments, such as you faine your purgatorie paines to be? Are they not blessed which die in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lord? The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet Esay saith, cap. 57. of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> righteous after their death, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
                     <pb n="124" facs="tcp:13044:67"/>
there shalbe peace, they shall rest in their beddes: <hi>Ergo,</hi> they that sleepe in the Lord, enioy a quiet rest.</p>
                  <p>The 2. argument is out of 1. Cor. 11. Saint Paul reher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth what he receiued and deliuered concerning the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, but oblation for the dead, he rehearseth no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> 
                     <hi>ergo</hi> he neither receiued nor deliuered it. So you make (sayth Bristowe) as though the Apostle there prescri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth the whole order of ministration contrary to that he sayeth afterwarde, of setting other things in order. I answere, that obiection is auoided in the same place immediatly after, Pur. 362. &amp; therefore I will not here repete the answere. And that it is not of one place ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatiuely, you your selfe here confesse, that I denye it to be written by any of the Euangelistes which entreat of the sacrament. But you are not ashamed to affirme, that the Apostle intended no more in that place, but to correct the sinne of vnworthie receiuing, vppon coulot of a place of Augustine, <q>
                        <hi>
                           <bibl>Ep. ad Ian. 118. Cap. 3.</bibl> Inde enim.</hi> For that respect, the Apostle also sayeth, that they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue it vnworthily, who do not by a reuerence singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly dewe, discerne it from other meates, as sufficiently appeareth through that same whole place in the first E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistle to the Corinthians, if it be diligently conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</q> Doth Augustine say, or can any man proue out of his saying, that he ment, that S. Paul <hi>intended no more, but to correct the sinne of the vnworthie receiuing?</hi> But admitt it were so, how could he better correct that sinne, then by shewing the whole institution, substantiall matter and fourme, ende and vse of that sacrament, and so he doth, although ceremonies and externall obseruations about it, he doth not expresse.</p>
                  <p>The third argument is out of <hi>Leu.</hi> 21. and <hi>Numer.</hi> 19. which prescribe what law was appointed for lamenting the dead and diuerse other ordinances concerning the dead, in which was no sacrifice, or prayer for the dead was offred, but that they were so separated from the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, that the priestes might haue nothing to do with them but in speciall cases.

Wherefore the sacrifice of Iudas Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chabaeus wheresoeuer hee learned it, hath no warrant i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>The fourth argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, of the whole scripture negatiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to conclude, I saide it is good logike, after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. All true doctrine is taught in the scripture: Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatorie is not taught in the scripture: therefore purgato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie is no true doctrine. Bristowe denyeth both the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ior and minor. The maior I haue prooued in this chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, part 1. after the examination of the 8. text of scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. The minor hee would prooue to be false by these reasons. First purgatorie is taught in the scripture in the Machabees, <hi>Which he saith is in the canon of the true Church, which I also confesse, to be the true Church in the thirde counce<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">
                           <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                        </gap> of Carthage, and therefore it is canonicall, if any other scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture be Canonicall.</hi> Supposing that which is false, that the Macabees were canonicall, yet is not Purgatorie proo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by them: prayer for the deade doeth not necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily drawe purgatorie after it. The Grecians of longe time haue vsed prayer for the deade, yet they doe not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the doctrine of purgatorie. But to prooue the Machabees to be Canonical, he citeth the third councel of Carthage, wherein the two bookes of Machabees are accounted amongest the rest. But there are also fiue bookes of Salomon, whereas wee knowe there are onely three, namely the Prouerbes, the Canticles and the Preacher. Therefore that canon prooueth a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest error of the councell to allowe fiue bookes of Salomon in steede of three. Let Bristowe now bring out the fourth and fifth booke of Salomon, and say they bee Canonicall, if any other scripture bee Cano nicall.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="127" facs="tcp:13044:68"/>
The Councell of Laodicea more auncient, nameth not the Machabees. Hierome a Priest of Rome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressely denyeth them to bee Canonicall, <hi>Praefatione <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>n Prouerbia.</hi> Ruffinus also, in his exposition of the Creede, affirmeth the Church not to receiue them as Canonicall: beside so many argumentes as the bookes them selues, doe minister which agree, that they were writen by the spirite of man, and not by the spirite of God.</p>
                  <p>To proceede, Bristow saith that purgatory is taught so plainely 1. Iohn 5. that I could not auoyde the place but by falling into this horrible absurditie, that wee may not praye for all men liuing. I saide in deede we ought not to pray for them that sinne vnto death, of which Iohn saith: I say not that you shoulde pray for it, or that any man should pray for it, as your vulgar tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation hath it: But howe it is prooued out of that place, he saith neuer a worde.</p>
                  <p>Last of all purgatorie is taught (saith Bristowe) <hi>Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially against you sir. Iohn 11. For you say after your manner pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing confidently, that Martha and Marie (as the scripture is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest) did not hope for any restitution of their brother Laza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus to his bodie, before the generall resurrection. If that bee so manifest, what else was it then but the rest of his soule that Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tha woulde haue Christ to pray for, when shee saide thus, vnto him: But also nowe I knowe that what soeuer thinges, thou shalte aske of God, God will graunt thee? To which purpose also some auncient writers expounde the place.</hi> Thus farre Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowe. But I pray you sir, why doe you not tell vs the names at least of those auncient writers that so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounde the place; Peraduenture they were not worth the naming. But are you such a cunning disputer <hi>ex concessis,</hi> to wrest that I say of Martha and Marie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the comming of Christe, to all times after? as though I sayd, that they neuer hoped for their brothers restitution, because they hoped not before Christe came to Bethanie, as Allen impudently coniectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, that Lazatus was restored to his bodye at their
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:13044:69"/>
prayers made at his tombe: where there is no mention of any prayers, but of lamentation only. I can not tel whether I shuld here require in you more wit or hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie, or else lesse impudence, &amp; malice. But this was your purpose of cauilling and quarilling, when you durst not attempt the confutation of my bookein such plaine or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der as I aunswered Allen, but in this confuse manner, to bring all my argumentes first out of ioynt, and then to play with them at your pleasure.</p>

For the Papistes holde, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> there are some sinnes so small, as they deserue not in their owne nature eternal damnation, as Bristow immediately hereafter confesseth, where he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nieth that the curse of God pronounced Deut. 27. and Gal. 3. against all them that abide not in all thinges written in the lawe, extendeth not vnto eternall death, saying that hanging on tree, or crucifying is not eternal death, and yet is accursed of God Deut. 21.</p>

the Galathians, to whome saint Paule writeth, were not Christians, but yet seduced by false Apostles, to take vpon them the obseruation of the lawe, which as it was impossible, so it would bring them from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> blessing of Christ, vnto the curse of God. That true Christians are discharged of this curse, it is by the onely merite of Christes satisfaction, and not that the sinnes them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues deserue not euerlasting death, though they b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>The two other places that I cite for this purpose: The soule that sinneth shall dye: Ezech. 18. and, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde of sinne is death: Rom. 6. he will expounde by the saying of saint Iames Chapt. 1. sinne when it is consum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, gendreth death: as though this place of S. Iames denyed sinne, not brought into acte, to deserue death, because shewing that the cause of mens destruction i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> in themselues, from the first concupisence to the laste and grosest Acte, hee concludeth that those grosse acts bring a man into eternall death. Our sauiour Christe saith, this is condemnation, that light is come into the worlde, and men haue loued darknes rather then light. Were it not good Logike and Diuinitie also, of this place to conclude, that condemnation perteineth not to men, but where the light offered is refused; or that if Christ had not come, none had ben condemned? Iohn. 3. and likewise, yea much rather, wher Christ saith: If I had not come and spoken vnto them, they shoulde not haue had sinne? Iohn. 15. Were the obstinate Iewes cleare of sinne by Bristowes iudgement, before Christ came? But let vs examine his reason. It is sinne (saith he) as soone as it is gendred, but it gendreth not death so so one as it is gendred: Therefore some sinne there is, that gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth notd eath. The minor is false, for Sainct Iames, saying that sinne consummat gendreth death, doth not say that sinne gendreth not death, so soone as it is gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred. But beholde yet his impudent wresting of the
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:13044:70"/>
scripture, hee addeth also an exception, vnto sinne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>summat, that not euery sinne consummat gendreth death, except <hi>the matter bee of weight accordingly. For els that the lightnesse of the matter, as an idle worde bringeth not death, hee sufficiently signifieth in saying, that in a weightie mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the lightnesse or imperfection of consent doth it not.</hi> These are his wordes, by which you may see, that without all shame, hee imputeth such sayings to Sainct Iames, as hee can finde neuer a worde in hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

But this is the manner of heretikes, which learne not all trueth out of the Scriptures to bring their opinion to the scripture, and to inforce the wordes thereof, against all equitie, to signifie and say, whatsoeuer it pleaseth them. Nowe that saint Iames holdeth that euerie sinne deserueth death, I will proue out of his owne saying, by this argument: Whoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer is guiltie of all the lawe and commaundements, deserueth eternall death: Whosoeuer offendeth in one, is guiltie of all: therefore whosoeuer offendeth in one, deserueth eternall death. The <hi>maior</hi> I truste you will graunt: The <hi>minor</hi> is Sainct Iames cap. 2. Whoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer shall keepe the whole lawe, and offende but in one pointe, hee is guiltie of all: Then seeing eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie sinne is a breach of Gods Lawe, as Sainct Iohn af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth, Iohn 3. not onely greate sinnes, but also small sinnes, wherein soeuer men offende against the lawe of GOD deserue eternall death, which cannot bee auoyded but by remission for Christes sake: for bee the sinne neuer so small, it is committed against GOD the authour of the Lawe, who thereby hath forbidden all sinnes, which reason the Apostle vseth, to prooue that hee which offendeth in one, is guiltie of all.</p>
                  <p>And therefore the textes by mee alleged doe suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently proue, that all sinnes of their owne nature are mortall.

That God remitteth the punishment, with the fault, in respect whereof the punishment is due, I proue by <note place="margin">Fulke.</note> Ezek. 18. &amp; 33. where the Lorde promiseth to put away the remembrance of a sinners offences, that truely turneth vnto him, bringing forth the fruits of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. Bristow saith, this taketh not place before the daye of iudgment, whereby it would ensue, that to man could haue comfort of his sinnes forgiuen in this life. But he opposeth the sayings of the Prophet, Psal, 24. &amp; 78. Lorde remember not the sinnes of my youth: and, Lorde remember not our olde sinnes: which are the prayers of the penitent, to obtaine forgiuenesse of their sinnes: which once obtained, they say, The Lorde hath remoued our sinnes from vs, as farre as the East is from the West. Psalme 102. That may bee, saith Bristowe, in respect that they bee remoued from eternall damnation, although they haue yet to abide neuer so much temporall punishment. I will proue that to bee false. To bee remoued as farre as the East is from the West, is as farre as may bee: but not to bee remoued from temporall punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is not to bee remoued as farre as may bee: therefore it is not to bee remoued as farre as the Easte is from the West. But the whole Psalme, saith Bristowe, is spoken not of the time of our receiuing into Gods fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour by absolution: but of our finall restitution, which shall bee at the later day.

                  <p>The Prodigall childe Luke 15. hee saithe, is the Gentile receiued by baptisme, who if after baptisme he became prodigall, hee saith, I haue not proued, that being receiued by penaunce, wee must enioyne him no more punishment, then at his other receiuing. Beside that he restrayning this parable onely to Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, comming first to Baptisme, depriueth the faithfull of inestimable comforte, hee neither hath any worde in the scripture so to restrayne it, and the whole contexte is against him. For Saincte Luke sheweth the occasion of the three parables of the loste sheepe, of the loste Groate, and of the prodigall Childe, to haue beene, because the Scribes and Pharisees murmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that he receiued the Publicanes, and sinners, which all were Iewes and circumcised, yet fallen from the couenant of God by infinite and notorious sinnes: therefore according to right analogie, the lost Childe,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:13044:72"/>
euen as the lost sheepe, and lost Groate, is euerie peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent sinner; the elder brother, as the 99. sheepe, and 9. groates are the Scribes and Pharisees, which through hypocrisy in their owne iudgement, are righteous and neede no repentaunce.</p>
                  <p>To the 2. debters Luke 7. he answereth, that although Christ forgaue them both, yet they both had to be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuen after, according to the proportion of their loue. This importeth manifest contradiction, he forgaue all, yet something was not forgiuen. Yea saith Bristowe, Marie had much sinnes forgiuen her, because she lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued much, and therefore long after her hartes conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, and therefore after her first forgiuenesse, Christe sayeth: Thy sinnes are forgiuen thee.</p>
                  <p>This is a strange kinde of reasoning. Christe shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the cause of Maries great loue, to haue bene for that great sinnes were forgiuen her, expresseth in voyce, that which she before conceiued by faith, that her sinnes were forgiuen her, <hi>Ergo</hi> after her first forgiuenes, she had need of a second, which she procured by loue. And yet it is more fonde, that in saying to Simon and of Simon the Pharisee: To whom lesse is forgiuen, he loueth lesse, he giueth him to vnderstand, that he owed more then he was aware, and therefore he should increase as Marie did in penitentiall loue. First howe proueth he that Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon was this other detter, to whom lesse was forgiuen? Secondly, admit that he was, howe proueth he, that he should shewe as great penitentiall loue as Marie, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his debt was not so great as Maries, and therefore needed not so great a proportion of his loue, according to his owne heresie of merite? Thirdly, when Christe sayeth, To whom lesse is forgiuen he loueth lesse, he speaketh not so much of the quantitie of sinnes, but the acknowledging of them greater or lesser. For he that confesseth great sinnes to be pardoned, acknowledgeth that he is bound to great loue, as Marie did: the Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>see, who, though his sinnes were as great as Maries, &amp; in GODS sight, by meanes of hypocrisie more abhomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable,
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:13044:72"/>
yet was so blinded in opinion of his owne righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse, that he sawe them not, and therefore this loue was as colde, as he imagined his sinnes forgiuen to be fewe and small.</p>
                  <p>Thus the historie of the sinneful womans great loue, proueth nothing that punishment remayneth due to be payed after the debt is forgiuen. Whether this woman were Marie Magdalen, as Brîstowe calleth her, I wil not here dispute. Saint Luke giueth her no name.

                  <p>The foundation is ouerthrowen, for all sinnes are <note place="margin">Fulke.</note> proued to deserue eternall death, and when God pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth them, he pardoneth them clearely, as well the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment as the guiltinesse, for what should he punishe in them that are guiltie of no sinne by his pardon. Therefore where I cited Psalm. 103. That God hath not dealt with vs according to our sinnes, &amp;c. Bristow is driuen to his former shift, that these wordes are spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of the Prophete onely, for the time of the finall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde which I haue confuted before.</p>
                  <p>Concerning those that repent at the houre of death, I sayde they haue rewarde of eternall life, as well as they that repent sooner, by authoritie of the parable Matthew 20. of them that came the last houre, to worke in the vineyarde.</p>
                  <p>Bristow saith, I am deceiued, because I cannot see any iustice in mercie. Yes verily, I see the iustice of God fully answered in Christ, not in the person that needeth mercie, who is pardoned and iustified <hi>gratis</hi> freely, Rom. 3. &amp; 11. But the spirite of God sayeth, Apoc. 2. that he will giue to euery one of you according to his workes: wherevpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Bristowe inferreth, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> God is not alike good to al, that he hath once shewed mercie vnto, for Christ, to all the baptised. I aunswere that texte is a threatning to Iesabel, &amp; them that commit fornication with her, if they do not repent from their workes. For it foloweth
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:13044:73"/>

What shall I say that Bristowe bringeth in a varietie of pence, contrary to the scope of the parable, &amp; affirmeth the pence to be wages for the working &amp; that also by bargaine? So that eternall life is not the gift of God, neither are men saued by grace &amp; not of workes, in his iudgement, contrary to the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles plaine doctrine. Eph. 2.</p>
                  <p>In the conclusion he saith, <hi>If you can prooue that God will shewe as full mercie also where he findeth not that fulnesse of Christes grace, then call vs hardly enimies, for not suffering God to shewe mercie to whom he will.</hi> But where wanteth that fulnesse of Christes grace, in any of Gods electe? Is it where greatest sinnes be? The Apostle answereth, where sinne hath abounded, grace hath more then abounded. Rom. 5.

                  <p>Another reason of mine is grounded vpon Allens wordes, which saith: that they which are in purgatory, ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not by any motion of minde, attaine more mercie, then their life past deserued.

                  <p>That I cite out of S. Iohn, being washed by Christ, we are throughly cleane. Iohn 13. &amp; out of Esay: Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though our sinnes were as red as scarlet, they are made as white as snowe: He answereth these places are euident of baptisme. And therefore he admitteth that I sayd of them so clensed, that they are made capable immediatly of the heauenly inheritance. But why, I pray you, are they euident of baptisme? because there is mention of washing in both places? Is there no washing but in baptisme? At least wise, will you saye, that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet Esay preaching to the people of his age, when hee called them to washing, called them to baptisme, so manye hundreth yeares before baptisme was instituted? Is it not therefore euident, that hee calleth them to repentaunce? Or else, hauing
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:13044:75"/>
first so grieuously accused them of their present sinnes, doeth he shewe no comfort, but in the sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme, which no man liuing could then possibly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine in such manner as you meane, no not the Prophet him selfe. I might well say to you, as you say to mee in another place, In good sooth Dauus, these things are not aptly diuided according to their times. And that Christ Iohn. 13. speaketh not of the ceremonie of baptisme, it i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> manifest by diuerse reasons, but of his grace by which he washeth vs from all our sinnes. And therefore be sayth to Peter, except he were washed of him, he coulde haue no part with him. But neither Peter, nor any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was or is baptised of him with water: Iohn 4. ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he speaketh not of the sacrament of baptisme. And where you adde, that he which is so washed, must neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelesse wash his feete, that is, say you, his veniall sinnes, which he committeth afterwarde, although he continue withall in the cleannesse of baptisme, before he be all cleane, and aske mee, what if he dye before he wash his feete? Admitting that the feete should signifie none but veniall sinnes. I aske you againe, who shall wash his feete, but he which washed Peters feet? for the true text is <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, he hath no neede but that his feete be washed. Peter could not wash his owne feete in this figuratiue signification, but except Christ did wash him he could haue no part with him. But if we should take the feete onely for veniall sinnes, and the generall washing for baptisme, this inconuenience would follow of Christes wordes: that he which is bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tised and purged from veniall sinnes, neede no purgati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to clense him from mortall sinnes, but is perfectly cleare. The wordes of our sauiour are generall, &amp; can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not admitt your exception, of continuing in the clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of baptisme: therefore the feete signifie all sinnes to be pardoned, after the first grace purging vs, which is in deede represented and ratified in baptisme, but yet is perfectly distinct from the sacrament, and often times deuided. For Iudas of whome you speake, if he had dyed immediatly after he was baptised, should not haue

                     </gap>y sacrifices of thanksgiuing, &amp; not of propitiation for sinne, which cannot be without shedding of bloud Heb. 9. Secondly, although we be all made priests, yet we are not made high priests, of which the text speaketh. Heb. 5. which office one only can enioy at one time, which is our sauiour Christ, for terme of his life, which is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out end. Thirdly, those sacrifices which the externall priest offered for sinnes, could neuer take away sinnes, Heb. 10. much lesse our spirituall sacrifices of thanksgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing for Gods benefites bestowed on vs, &amp; his whole church. I cited further. Apoc. 7. These are they y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> came out of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> great affliction, &amp; haue washed their stoles, and made them white in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bloud of the lamb: therfore they are in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> presence of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> throne of god. Brist. saith, this word
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:13044:77"/>
therefore, is referred to their comming out of affliction, and so whited their stoles: <hi>And yet this gloser (saith he of me) taketh it away from the affliction, whereas that whiting was nothing else but that affliction.</hi> O impudent and blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous heretike: when the holy ghost expressely sayeth, they made their stoles white in the bloud of the lamb, darest thou open thy mouth and saye, not only, <hi>that that whiting was somewhat else then the bloud of Christ, but also that it was nothing but that affliction,</hi> so vtterly excluding the bloud of Christ? But I forgot to conferre other places of scripture, as he chargeth me. Is there any scripture that ascribeth purification of our sinnes, to any other thing, than to the bloud of Christ? Let vs heare what, whoso ouercommeth, shalbe clothed with white gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Apoc. 3. But the Martyrs ouercame the diuell, not onely by the blood of the lambe, but also by their owne patient confession, or affliction vnto death. Apoc. 12. The text is: and they ouercame him by the bloud of the lambe, and by the word of their testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, and they loued not their liues vnto death. Here is no cause of victorie, but the bloud of the lambe, and the worde of their testimonie, which was the confession of their faith, the onely instrumentall cause of their iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication and victorie: who is he which ouercommeth the world, sayth S. Iohn, but he that beleueth? 1. Iohn 5. Faith therefore the onely shilde to haue victory against the worlde and the diuell, hath no power in it selfe to clense our sinnes, but leaneth altogether to the bloud of Christ. But it is a proper thing to see Bristow forsake his vulgar latine authenticall translation, and to turne <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> by their owne martyrdom, which is in deede by the worde of their testimonie, or which they did testifie: whereas by his translation <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> should be taken for suffering of death, as I thinke it is in no Greeke author, sure I am it is neuer so taken in the newe testament.</p>
                  <p>But Bristow addeth: <hi>that S. Paul also accordingly calleth it the mortification of Iesus, when the Apostles were mortifyed
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:13044:77"/>
for Iesus, and sayeth they carryed the same about continually in their bodies, that also the life of Iesus might also be manifected in their bodies, 2. Cor.</hi> 4. I wot well, wee must be confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable to Christ in sufferings, that we may be partakers of his kingdome and glorie: but doeth it therefore fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe, that our sufferings merit this glorie by his bloud? or that his bloud without all respect of our merites, doeth not alone purge and clense vs from all our sinnes? After he had finished the cleansing of our sinnes by his owne selfe, sayeth the Apostle, he is set downe at the right hande of magnificence in the highest. Heb. 1.</p>
                  <p>Last of all, Bristowe opposeth that Saint Paul sayth: <hi>This our affliction although it be but short and light, worketh vs euerlasting weight of glory exceeding measure aboue mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure. 2. Cor.</hi> 4. I answere, it worketh not by meriting, not by purging our sinnes, or by satisfying for our iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, but by making vs conformable vnto our head, in passing by the same way of tribulatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s vnto glorie, that he did, euen as the way or steppes which leadeth vnto an high place of dignitie, maketh not them worthie of the dignitie that must ascende by those steppes vnto it, and yet it is necessarie for them that will come to that dignitie, to sit in such places, to take that ordinary way. Therefore as the passage of such way worketh their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnitie, so doeth affliction worke our glory. Not to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge any part of the glorie or merite of Christes suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering, by which onely wee are made worthie of glory when all our sinnes being cleansed by his bloud, wee appeare righteous before God, not in the merite of our owne workes, nor hauing our owne righteousnes, which is by the lawe, but the righteousnesse of God, which is by faith of Iesus Christ, that wee may knowe him of the power of his resurrection, and the fellowship of his suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings being made conformable vnto his death, Phil. 3. Wherefore it remaineth, that seeing the bloud of Christ purgeth vs of all our sinnes, and Iesus Christ is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> propitiation for our sinnes, committed either after bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme or before, that all other purgings and satisfactio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s are ouerthrowen, and so popish purgatorie remaineth
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:13044:78"/>
without any foundation: the purging of Christs bloud making vs most pure: and Christ our propitiation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing throughly &amp; only sufficient to reconcile vs.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly: directly of Purgatorie it selfe &amp; prayer for the</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Bristowe.</note> 
                     <hi>dead, whether all the elect goe streight to heauen. Afore Christes comming Limbus patrum.</hi>

                  <p>His childish rayling on mine argumentes, with that <note place="margin">Fulke.</note> impudent slaunder of all the church of God, which he affirmeth was ignorant that any soules went to heauen before their church had defined it, within these 300. yeres, I passe ouer, &amp; come to the matter in question. I said Purg. 57. against Allen, mainteining that all the iust before Christ were punished for their sinnes forgiue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ma ny hundreth yeres after their departure in hel. <hi>That the fathers of the olde testament before Christ were not in hell, it is to be proued with manifest arguments &amp; autorities out of holy scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures. Although they were not, nor yet are in perfect blessednes, God prouiding a better thing for vs, that they without vs, shuld not be made perfect. Heb.</hi> 11. But by this text (saith Brist.) S. Paul doth meane, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> their soules were not yet admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into heauen. How proueth he that? forsooth, the old testament did consummate nothing, &amp;c. but their sinnes remaining not perfectly remitted, Christ died, &amp;c. A sore bolt, as though any man had his sinnes forgiuen, but by the new testament, or could be heire of the kingdom of heauen, but by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> death of Christ. But the same apostle saith. Heb 9. That the way of the saints, was not yet o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, while the first tabernacle stood. Bristow addeth to the text of his own, into <hi>soncta</hi> or heauen: wher the apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle meaneth of the worke of Christs redemption in his death, resurrection &amp; ascension, the effect wherof, neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theles was extended no lesse to the fathers of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> olde te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament, then to vs. Thirdly, the apostle saith, Heb. 10. that we haue confidence to enter in to the holy place, by the bloud of Iesus, which hath dedicated y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> new &amp; liuing way for vs, through the vayle that is his flesh. All which proueth nothing, but that there is no entrance into hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, but by Christ, which way is comon to all y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> saintes of God, of all ages. But Bristow biddeth me conferre the
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:13044:78"/>
end of my text. Heb. 11. with the beginning: where he saith, they receiued not y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> promise which is the expositio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of their not consummating: I admit it: for no Christian receiueth the promise consummate before the resurrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their bodies. The consummation of which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, &amp; perfection of the saints, God reserueth vnto one time, when we shal all receiue the promise &amp; consum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation together: that they without vs (saith he) shoulde not be consummate, the same reason is of the apostles &amp; fathers of the primitiue church, &amp; vs of the later church, &amp; them y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> shalbe to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> end of the world. Now to mine arguments &amp; autorities of scripture. I reason, that seeing they all beleeued in Christ, they had euerlasting life, &amp; entred not into condemnation, but passed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> death to life. Ioh. 5. <hi>To what life</hi> (saith Bristow) <hi>but the life or resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of their bodies? for vntil the last day, all the dead are in death.</hi> O prodigious heretike, call you that a passage fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> death to life, to continue in death 5. or 6. thousa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d years? Is God then to this new Saducee, the god of the dead &amp; not of the liuing? yea, he saith, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> life after corporal deth in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> new testament, lightly euery where, signifieth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection of the bodies. What is it then to take hold of eternall life in this world, which shalbe interrupted w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> so long abyding in death? 1. Tim. 6. And how can it be true which our sauiour saith: he that beleueth in me, hath alreadie eternal life, if they y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> are passed out of this world are all in death? wherfore then is this eternall life interupted with any Purgatorie, <hi>Limbus patrum,</hi> or death.</p>
                  <p>The second argument is, of that Christ is called the lamb that was slaine from the beginning of the worlde; because the benefite of his passion extendeth vnto the godly of all ages alike. Apoc. 13. To this, the beast hath nothing to answere, but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it is not said, <hi>that the lambe was slaine from the beginning of the world:</hi> but that all the repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates shal adore antichrist whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he cometh. And because Apoc. 17. the words be: whose names were not written in the booke of life fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the beginning of the world: he would haue those wordes from the beginning of the world, by a monstrous construction, contrary to the
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:13044:79"/>
manifest composition and pointing, both in the Greeke &amp; vulgare Latine, to be referred not to the lamb slaine, but to the booke of life. As though both those textes in their seuerall sense might not be true, except such manifest violence were offered to the construction co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position &amp; pointing in this text of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Apoc. Yet he confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth it to be true, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> lambe was slaine from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the world, which is no where else written in the scripture, but heere: the cause of the trueth, he will not haue to be my fonde sense, but because his death was preordeined of God, and prefigured so long before. A substantiall cause by which we may say, that Bristowe was dead from the beginning of the world, because his death was so long before ordeined of God, and prefigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the death of Adam.</p>
                  <p>The third argument is, that Esay speaking of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous that are departed out of this life, sayeth that there is peace, and that they shall rest in their beddes, Esa. 57. like as he affirmeth that Topheth which is Gehinnon, or hell, is prepared of olde for the wicked. To this he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swereth, that Esay speaketh not of his owne time, but as a Prophet, of the time now since the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming of Christ, who is our peace, as though Christ were not their peace as well as oures. And what a shamelesse answere is this, to denye the doctrine of the Prophet concerning the comfort of the faithfull after death, to perteine to the faithfull of his owne time, to whome then it was in vaine preached and published by the Prophet? After a little quarreling against my translatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, the sense wherof he cannot deny: he asketh, if the rest of the soules must needes be the blisse of heauen? and telleth vs that their Limbus was not a place of sensible paine: But sir, <hi>Salom</hi> whereinto the Prophet sayeth the righteous doe goe, will not onely giue them rest, without sense of paine: but peace with happinesse and prosperitie. Finally, he sayeth, <hi>Topheth</hi> or <hi>Gehenna,</hi> was not the onely hell, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause our Creede and the Scripture sayeth, that Christes soule was in hell: I answere, that hell signifyeth either the place, or state of torments for sinnes: in the former,
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:13044:79"/>
Caluine (whome you slaunder) sayth not that Christ was in, but in the later, when he complained that he was forsaken of God: there is not therefore proued, by Christes discending into hell, any other place or recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacle of soules in hell, but <hi>Topheth</hi> and <hi>Gehenna</hi> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> place of the damned.</p>
                  <p>The fourth argument against <hi>Limbus,</hi> is, that Lazarus was carryed by Angels, not downe to hell, but vp to A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brahams bosome. But the riche man being in hell, loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked vp and seeth Abraham afarre of. Bristowe asketh whether <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> signifie to be carryed vp? sir, it signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth to be carried away, and seeing the riche man loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king vp, seeth Lazarus afarre of, it followeth that Laza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus was carried vp and not downe. But you reply, it fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth not that he was carryed into heauen. Then you may say he was carried vp to hell. But the places you say might be nigh together in respect of the distance of heauen, although one were vpwarde, and also farre off both in state and situation (purgatorie peraduenture be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt them.) This is a goodly faith, that standeth vpon peraduenture, and this may be, &amp;c. The Scripture saith, ther was a great Chaos which is an infinite distance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene them, which cannot agree to <hi>Limbus,</hi> which must be harde adioyning to hell, or else it is not <hi>Limbus.</hi> But if they were no way nigh together (sayth he) it will not followe that Abrahams bosome was heauen. I answere, if they were no way nigh together, it could not be hell, nor <hi>Limbus</hi> of hell, which is the thing I was to proue. Also the text is plaine, that Abrahams bosome was a place of comfort. And other place of comfort then heauen or Paradise, which is all one, for the soules de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted, I finde none in Scripture.</p>
                  <p>The last argument is this: If righteousnesse belong to Abrahams children, the rewarde of righteousnesse also perteineth to them. Therefore Abrahams bosome was open to receiue all the childrem of Abraham, euen as the bosome of God was readie to receiue Abraham, because he was his sonne through faith.</p>
                  <p>Heere Bristowe noteth no small blasphemie, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:13044:80"/>
of grosse ignorance, saying, <hi>That which is proper to vnigenitus, the onely begotten sonne of God, hee maketh common to Abraham.</hi> Why Bristowe? because vnigenitus is eternally, and after his proper manner, in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some of the father, doth it thereof followe, that none can be in the bosom of GOD, but the proper place of Christ is made common to them? You threaten in the 12. Chapter oftentimes to bewray my grosse ignorance in the scriptures, and haue you such fine knowledge in them, that you coulde not see what Esay writeth Chap. 40. according to your owne translation, <hi>Ecce dominus Deus, &amp;c.</hi> Beholde the Lorde God shall come in strength, and his arme shall haue the dominion: beholde his rewarde is with him, and his worke before him: As a sheepheard hee will feede his flocke, hee will gather the Lambes together on his arme and beare them in his bosome: in <hi>sin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> suo leuabit?</hi> Beholde you greate and mightie doctours in the scriptures, the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some of GOD as of a shephearde, is open to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue all his Lambes; howe much more as a father to receiue his children? But to the argument you aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere: The rewarde of righteousnesse may belong to one, and yet not payed him, as soone as hee dyeth. Saincte Paule saying expresly of Abraham and many of his children, that they departed not recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the promises, but beholding them a farre off: and all these renouned by faith, receiued not the promise. That is (saith Bristowe) the inheritance, the rewarde of righteousnesse: I replye, the rewarde of righteousnesse cannot belonge to one, but it must bee payed him as soone as it is payed vnto others, to whome the same rewarde, vppon the same cause be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth: therefore seeing it is payed to some imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately after their death, it is likewise to all. That manie dyed not receiuing the promises, is partelie vnderstoode of the promises of the lande of Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, partelye of the full fruition and perfection of rewarde, which to all men is denyed before the laste

But the circumstance of the place (saith Bristowe) giueth it to bee meant of martyrs. I aunswere, there is no circumstance that can proue it to bee spoken onely of Martyrs) seeing the argument of their blessednesse, is dying in the Lorde, whiche is common to all the faithfull, therefore blessednesse also, and that is the iudgement of S.

                  <p>Another argument is out of Matth. 7. of the two wayes, if there bee but two wayes in this life, there are but two abiding places after this life. To this Bristowe aunswereth, although the argument bee not mine, but an obiection that Allen taketh on him to aunswere: First that in the wide way some goe wider then some, with infinite varietie, but all to damnation presently: Secondly in the narrowe way, some goe nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rower then some with infinite varietie, yet all in the narrowe way: <hi>Ergo</hi> say I, all straight to saluation.

Wherefore it cannot bee the way of merites but of faith.</p>
                  <p>Another argument is of the text 2. Cor. 5. We shall all stande before the iudgement seate of Christ, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie one may receiue in his bodie according to such things as he hath done either good or euill. Therefore the prayers or deedes of other men helpe not. To this he aunswereth out of Augustine, that the deade in our Lorde, hath in his life deserued, that these workes after his death might be profitable to him. Against which au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, he saith, I haue no reply, to maintain that scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture against such prayer, but onely oppose a saying of Hierom. I think the scripture it selfe is a sufficient replie against all authoritie of man. Euerie man shall receiue according to his owne workes, and not according to the workes of other men, as for the deserte of man, it is
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:13044:82"/>
nothing but vnto damnation. And yet that argument is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

And doth it therefore followe, that works done after faith, doe iustifie? Saint Paule extendeth the saluation (which is sealed vnto vs by the lauer of newe birth, and renewing of the holy Ghoste, which he hath poured richly vpon vs by Iesus Christ our sauiour, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to eternall life: therefore it followeth, that beeing iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by his grace, we might be made heires according to the hope of eternall life. Vpon the 2. text Es. 64. I saide: the Popish Church is not content to be clothed in the white shining silke, which is the iustification of Saintes, made white in the bloud of the lambe, but with the fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy ragges of mannes righteousnesse. Bristowe as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth where I learned, to call the good workes done in the Church, the filthy ragges of mans righteousnesse?
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:13044:85"/>
Verily, euen of Esaie who speaketh in the person of the Church: All we are as an vncleane person, and all our righteousnesse, as filthy ragges. For although God accept our workes, that are done in faith, and pardon their imperfection, yet when they are obtruded vnto him, to iustifie vs, he abhorreth them, as in the Pharisee Luke 18. That the iustifications of the Saintes. Apoc. 19. are good workes, Bristowe would haue it appeare by conference of 1. Iohn. 3. He that worketh iustice is iust, where he reasoneth of the effectes of a iust man, &amp; not of the cause. No flesh is iust by workes of the law, but by faith, by which God maketh iust, euen the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly man.

Ephe. 5.</p>

                  <p>Concerning inuocation of Saints, I saide Purg. 451. <note place="margin">Fulke.</note> wee call not vpon Saints, because we beleeue not in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: for how should wee call vpon them in whom wee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leue not? Rom. 10. To this (reseruing a pretended contradiction to the proper place) he saith: first that Saint Paule, did often inuocate &amp; call vppon the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, beseching them to pray for him, which is a toye to mocke with an Ape, for Saint Paule did not inuocate or pray to them as vnto them that knewe his hearte, and could helpe his greefe, but onely of charitie desireth their prayers. Secondly he asketh, where is any Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that we must beleeue in God onely? Forsooth, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst many, this shal suffice, which is written in Iere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie Cap. 17. Cursed is the man that trusteth in man,
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:13044:86"/>
and maketh flesh his arme, and his heart departeth from the Lord. But that it is lawfull to bêleue in Saints also, Bristowe quoteth Exod. 14. where it is said, the people beleeued God, and Moses his seruant, as though there were no difference betweene giuing credite to Gods Prophets, and beleeuing in them, which is to put our trust in them. The like I saie to the seconde place, quoted 2. Par. 20. where Iosaphat promiseth all things prosperous to the people, if they giue credite to Gods Prophets, <hi>Credite Prophetis eius.</hi> But forlaking his vulgar authentical translation, he prouoketh vs to the Hebrue, belyke because of the preposition, beth, which is a miserable shift: Seing the Hebrue phrase is well knowen, to differ from the Latine, and English phrase, and especially from the sense of beleuing, that is tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting in God, which is peculiar to him and ought not to be in any creature, which is not God.</p>
                  <p>He quoteth also Philemon, whose loue &amp; faith the Apostle commendeth towardes the Lorde Iesu, and towards all his Saints, where euerie wise man seeth that faith is referred to Christ, and loue to the Saints. But the scripture reacheth him to beleeue (he saith) in Christ according to his humanity and namely in his blood. Iohn. 14. Rom. 3. He will proue an Arian or a Nestorian shortly. The place of Iohn proueth the diuinity of Christ, because he is to be beleeued on, euen as God. And where the Apostle saith, that God hath made Christ a propitiation through faith in his blood, he meaneth not that we must beleue in the blood of Christ, as it is a creature, but that the death and blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shedding of Christ, is the meane of our reconciliation vnto God. But the Nicene Creede &amp; Hieronyme, <hi>contra Lucif.</hi> vse the phrase of <hi>Credere in Ecclesiam,</hi> to beleeue in the Church. I answere, they meane no more there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, then they which vse the distinction <hi>Credere in Deum, Credere Deo, &amp; Credere Deum,</hi> which Bristowe saith hath deceiued me. Augustine (as Bristowe confesseth) maketh it proper to God, that we beleeue in him</p>
                  <p>We beleeue not in Peter, we beleeue not in Paule.
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:13044:86"/>
In Iohn. 129. Neither saith the Nicene Creede, or Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronyme contrary thereto, that we should put our whole trust and confidence in the Church, but in God only. Therfore although they speak otherwise then Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine, they meane not otherwise then he. Ruffinus also in his exposition of the Creede, writeth both plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and effectually: <q>
                        <hi>Sequitur namque post, &amp;c.</hi> For it followeth after this saying: The holy Catholique Church, the remission of sinnes, the resurrection of the bodie: he saith not in the holy Catholique Church, in the remission of sinnes, in the resurrection of the fleshe. For if he had added, the preposition, In, the sense should haue bene made one, and the same with the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer articles. But euen in those termes truly, where faith is ordered of the diuinitie, it is saide, in God the father, and in Christ his sonne, and in the holy Ghost. But in the rest, where the speach is not of the Godhead, but of creatures and the mysteries, the preposition, In, is not added, that it should be said we must beleeue in the holy Church, but the holy Church: not as God, but as the Church gathered into God. And that men should beleue, that there is remission of sinnes, not in the remission of sinnes, that they should beleeue the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection of the body, not in the resurrection of the body. Therefore by this syllable of the Preposition, the Creator is distinguished from the creatures, and things diuine, are separated from things humane.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Neuerthelesse, Bristowe saith, they beleue both in God, in Christ and in his Saints, and inuocate them all, though not all alyke, but then let him heare, what Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian saith, <q>
                        <hi>De duplici Martyrio. Non credit in Deum, qui non in eo solo collocat totius faelicitatis suae fiduciam.</hi> He bele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth not in God, which placeth not in him alone, the hope of his whole felicity.</q> Whervpon it followeth, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they which beleeue in saints, &amp; place some part of their hope of felicite in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; not in God alone, by his iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, &amp; by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> iudgment of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Apostle also beleeue not in God. Where I said, if Saints also are to be inuocated, then God alone knoweth not the heartes of all men,
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:13044:87"/>
and God onely is not to be worshipped and serued, and Christ is not our onely Mediatour and Aduocate: Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowe calleth it iangling, without allegations. I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed these principles had bene sufficiently knowen to euerie learned Papist, without allegations, but seeing Bristowe will not take knowledge of them, because he knoweth not how to shift his handes of them. For the first, my allegation shall be 1. Reg. 8. Salomon in his prayer sayth vnto God: What prayers or supplications shalbe made of any man, or of all thy people Israel, when euerie one shal knowe the plague in his own hart, and stretche foorth his handes in this house, Heare thou then in heauen in thy dwelling place, and be merciful, and doe and giue euery man according to all his wayes as thou knowest his heart, for thou onely knowest the harts of al the children of men. For the second, that God only is to be worshiped and serued, it is the saying of our sauiour Christ, Math. 4. &amp; Luk 4. Thou shalt worship the Lorde thy God, and him only shalt thou serue.</p>
                  <p>That Christe onely is our Mediator and Aduocate, Saint Paule testifieth 1. Timoth. 2. there is but one God and one mediatour of God and men, the man Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ, in which place he speaketh of Prayer, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications, intercessions, &amp;c. to be made for all men. And Saint Iohn 1. Ioh. 2. If any man sinne, we haue an aduocate with the father Iesus Christ the righteous and he is the propitiation for our sins. But, saith Brist, as I say to Ambrose, &amp; others whom I confesse to be of the true Church, so must I saie it to Saint Iohn Apoc. 1. for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocating the holy Angells. But I finde not that Iohn did inuocate the holy Angels, in that place, although the seuen spirites from whom he wisheth grace, should not be the holy Ghost, but Angels the ministers of the holy Ghost. For he that prayeth that God will sende raine from heauen, doth not inuocate heauen. But I must saie the same to God him self, for making an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell to be worshiped as Apoc. 3. as he hath told me in the. 6. Chapiter, where I haue told him mine answere.
<pb facs="tcp:13044:87"/>
likewise to the Angell Apoc. 8. <hi>Which made a perfume with the prayers of Saintes, and to the 24. Seniors which had sweete odours, that is, prayers in bowles, &amp;c.</hi> But there is no such neede, the Angell Apoc. 8. representeth Christe, the onely high priest that hath authoritie to stande at the altar in heauen, and offer incense, and to present the prayers of the Churche, that they may be acceptable to God. Heb. 13. The Elders are the Churche of God, in the whole world, whose prayers and supplications, only our sauiour Christ maketh acceptable. But it maketh nothing against our Mediatour to God, saith Bristowe, though we are and haue neuer so many Mediatours, so y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> all make suite to God by him. Then it maketh no mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter howe many petie Gods we haue, so one be principal, as Plato taught. Againe he saith: it is nothing against God alone, to be worshipped, so that we worshippe none but for him. If this were true, it were lawfull to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship the Diuel, because hee is Gods minister, and hath great power vnder him: yea our Sauiour Christ had not aunswered his temptation, when he required to be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped, as one that had all the glorie of the world com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by God to him to bestowe at his pleasure, in saying it is written, Thou shalt worship the Lorde thy God, and him only shalt thou serue. Last of all, he saith it is nothing against God aboue, to know our harts, so y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> all others knowe them by him. But Salomon reasoneth that God onely is to be called vpon, because he onely knoweth the heartes of all men. And where findeth Bristowe, that all others, or any one by God, knoweth the heartes of all men? To conclude, the worde onely, excludeth no more with Bristowe, then he list to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitte by his blinde distinctions, which if they may be permitted against the plaine sense and wordes of the Scriptures, nothing shalbe left proper to God, nothing proper to our Sauiour Christe, nothing proper to any thing, that the Scripture maketh peculiar vnto it.</p>
                  <p>The next title is fasting, about which Bristowe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porteth, that I say: Purg. 391. You are they that attend to spirites of errors, &amp; doctrine of deuils, forbidding to
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:13044:88"/>
marry, &amp; abstaining, or commaunding to abstaine from meates, which God hath created to bee receiued with thanksgiuing. 1. Tim. 4. There is the brandmarke of Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish religion, that all the water in Tiberis, nor in the Ocean sea, shall not be able to wash out. Against this: <hi>Soft alitle</hi> (sayeth Bristowe) <hi>and you shall see mee drawe inough &amp; inough againe, euen out of your owne puddle, to wash all sufficiently.</hi> But what draweth hee? I confesse that Aerius &amp; Iouinian condemned fasting or fasting dayes? what then? Abstinence from certeine meates is a que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion distinct from fasting, which is abstinence from all meates. But Iouinian (sayeth hee) taught absti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence from certeine meates to profite nothing. Well: Aerius contrariwise taught abstinence from fleshe to be a religious matter, as you Papistes doe. For to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steine from wine, fleshe, fishe, spices, fruites, or any thing which perteyneth to sobrietie, is not to thinke it vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull to eate or drinke any of these, at this tyme, or that time, as it is thought of you Papistes, and a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of more holynesse, to fill your belly with fishe, then with fleshe, although the fish, wyne, fruites, spices, and such like confections as you eate, be tenne times more dangerous vnto sobrietie and chastitie, then a piece of beef<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> or bacon, which a poore man eateth on a fry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day to satisfie his hunger, and giueth God thankes for it. Your publike admitting of all incentiue meates &amp; drinkes, except flesh or white meate on your fasting dayes, sufficiently declareth, that neither fasting nor chastisement of mens bodyes is your intent: but as the Apostle sayeth, false speaking in hypocrisie. But whome and what doeth Saint Paul meane (sayeth Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowe?) Hee aunswereth, the Manichees, the Tacia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistes, and other heretikes, which sayde, that certeine meates were the creatures of the diuell. Nay Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowe, not them onely, nor principally; but all other heretikes that sayde, fleshe was vncleane, although they confessed it to be the creature of God, as the Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riaus and Priscillianistes, and specially the Papistes,
<pb facs="tcp:13044:88"/>
which vnder pretence of holynesse, as fasting and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitie, commaunde to abstaine from meates and mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage. For they that abstaine from these things, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they are the creatures of the diuell, speake not a lye in hypocrisie, but an open blasphemie. As for the example of them, whose voluntarie abstinence from meates or marriage, Saint Augustine defendeth, <hi>contra Faust. lib. 30. Cap.</hi> 6. cannot excuse you, which for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid meates and marriage, more imperiously to some men at all times, and to all men at some times, then e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the Manichees did to their cleargie, or priests, which they called perfect ones.</p>
                  <p>Another saying of myne, Art. 46. Bristowe repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth: If Iouinian taught that fasting, abstinence from certeine meates, and other bodily exercises, of them selues profite little, his doctrine agreeth with the doctrine of Saint Paul, 1. Timothie. 4. But if he taught, as hee is charged, that such thinges profite nothing at all, wee agree not with him in that opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.</p>
                  <p>To this (Bristowe sayeth) I woulde fayne wype myne handes of Iouinians heresie, but it will not bee: For his heresie was, that fasting and abstinence is not more meritorious then eating with thankesgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing. If you call this heresie, I am nothing asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of it: there is no more merite in the one than in the other. But howe prooue you that was his he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resie? Forsooth Augustine <hi>De dogm. Eccles. Cap.</hi> 68. so sayeth. But who shall graunt vnto him, that bastarde collection to be of Saint Augustines penning? Well then the vndoubted Augustine, <hi>ad Quodvult enim</hi> sayeth: <hi>meritis adaequabat,</hi> hee made equall to the merites, of chaste and faithfull matrimonies, the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginitie, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>But hee that is acquainted with Saint Augustines writinges, shall perceiue that by merites, often times he meaneth not as the Papistes doe, the desert of good works, but y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> dignitie, excellency, commendation.

Because he doeth onely aske, it shall suffice to aunswere onely, yea, they are sacraments of the newe testament, and instituted by Christe, the mediatour of the newe testament, by which our fathers were saued, although by Christe comming in the fleshe, they were <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Of orders, you reade, Math. 26. but I reade nothing at all, although I reade that the Apostles were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded to continue the celebration of his supper in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted by him, which were before ministers of his sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentes and preachers of his worde; but of Bennet and Collet, coniurer, subdeacon, or masse priest, I reade not in all the Scripture, nor of Deacon in that Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter.</p>
                  <p>Of Matrimonie, both yet and I reade Math. 19 but not instituted at that time by Christ, but long before in Paradise, and is no more a sacrament of the newe te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament, then the raynebowe, which yet with the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenant thereof remaineth in vse among Christians. But you confesse you reade not in those places, that they are sacramentes, no more doe you reade, 1. Cor. 10. that baptisme, or the Lordes supper are sacraments or any where else. This is a stale quarrell, of the name of sacramentes, which is not founde in Scripture, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the thing signified by the name, that is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> seales of Gods promises, and the name of signe of Gods co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenants be often founde.</p>
                  <p>But your laste refuge is, that the Apostle speaketh onely of the firste entrance into Christianitie, which in antiquitie was by baptisme, confirmation, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement of baptisme, and the Euchariste, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore speaketh not of the rest. Beside that this fantasie is manifestly contrarie to the Apostles purpose, which was to shewe, that the externall sacramentes of Gods grace, without a godly life, woulde not serue to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure vs, that God was pleased withvs: it is cleare, that the Corinthians, among whome Saint Paul so long
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:13044:91"/>
had preached, coulde not bee without all other sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, if any other were. They had children to bee confirmed, they themselues were married, elders were to bee ordered, offenders by penaunce were to bee reconciled, manie were sicke, and some were fallen a sleepe, to bee anealed. And Saincte Paule saith expressely, they were behinde in no grace or gifte of Gods spirite. 1. Corinth. 1. Wherefore, that they <hi>were younge nouices newely entred the barres, and not knightes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercised in battell,</hi> it is a dreame of Bristowes drowsi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Secondly I say, of the sacramentes in generall, that they giue not grace <hi>ex opere operato,</hi> of the worke wrought, but after the faith of the receiuer and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the election of Go<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>. Corin. 10. Againe, howe should the sacrament giue grace of the worke wrought, if faith were requisite in them that receiue them? This argument, saith Bristowe, holdeth aswell against the working of Christs passion. Why sir, the passio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Christ giueth not grace, but to the faithfull and electe of God.</p>
                  <p>But faith, you say, is no work, nor instrume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, but only a dispofition as drynesse in wodde, that the fire wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth vppon. I will not enter into any philosophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call disputation with you, whether it bee drinesse or moysture in the wodde that the fire worketh vpon, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps you thinke, that water is moyster then ayre, which error, if you had no more, cannot make you an here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tike.</p>
                  <p>But I meruaile, what cause you will make faith, seing you exclude it from efficients, except you make it a matter, for the sacraments to worke vpon, or else I know not what you meane by y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> your disposition lyke drienesse in woode, which in deede is the thinne ayer, more apte to receiue inflammations, then the thicke water, but perhaps you make it onely <hi>a potentia,</hi> like <hi>materia prima,</hi> for you adde, <hi>that by our indisposition wee doe not put obicem.</hi>

                     <pb n="172" facs="tcp:13044:92"/>
But you hold that the sacraments giue grace of the work wrought, without the good motion of the vser, onely so hee doe no part <hi>obicem,</hi> that is, so he doe not withstand the working, as if a man be baptised sleeping, and thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king nothing of it. Neuerthelesse seing the scripture of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten affirmeth that God worketh in vs by faith, faith must needes bee an instrumentall efficient, when you haue saide all that you can, except you will teach vs newe gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer and Lògike. You confesse the scripture sayth, that by beleeuing and other good actions, wee worke our owne saluation, Phil. 2. as by way of meriting, but it saith not that we worke the effect of any sacrament: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doe I say, that wee worke the effecte of any sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but that God worketh in vs according to faith, which he giueth vs, and his election. You say further; that the scripture teacheth, that the passion of Christ gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth to our deedes vertue to merite: where is that scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture written? for vntill you shewe me where it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, I will say still to you as I saide to Allen, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Church of Christ abhorreth that blasphemie, beleeuing stedfast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that we are iustified freely by his grace through the redemptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Christ Iesus, without respect of our works. Rom. 3. 4.</p>
                  <p>But yet Bristowe will make men beleeue, that I shew manifolde ignorance, where I say Purg. 35. The meane on Gods behalfe by which we are made partakers of the fruites of Christes passion, and so graffed into his bodie, is his holy spirite of promise, which is the earnest and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suring of our inheritaunce: who worketh in vs faith, as the onely meane by which the righteousnesse of Christ is applyed vnto vs, Ephe. 1. And as for the sacramentes, (which you seeme to make the only conduites of Gods mercie) we are taught in the holy scriptures that they are the seales of Gods promises giuen for the confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of our faith, as was circumcision to Abraham, when he was iustified before through faith. Rom. 4.</p>
                  <p>Bristowes eyes being daseled at the cleere light of this trueth, turneth his heade away from the matter, and wrangleth against diuerse points of Caluinisme, as hee
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:13044:92"/>
saith, but in deede of meere Bristowisme. For Caluin neuer helde any such matter as he imagineth: He asketh whether this be to say, that all men are iustified before they come to the sacrament, as though Caluin said they were. Whereas a great number are iustified neither be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, nor after the receipt of them. But this is to say, that as Abraham was iustified by faith, without respect of the sacrament, so are all they that are iustified, iustified by faith, without respect of the sacrament. Secondly he asketh, whether all sacraments be seales of such a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Yea verely, or else saint Paul proueth the iustificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Gentiles by faith, very feebly, after the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Abraham. Thirdly hee asketh whether all Iewes were iustified, before they came to circumcision, which I neuer hearde any man to affirme, but that as many Iewes as were iustified, were iustified by faith, as Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham was, circumcision no more regarded in their iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, then it was in the iustification of Abraham. Last of all he asketh, whether circumcision were to the Iewes a seale of such a matter? still he calleth it such a matter, because he dare not name iustification by faith. O the stinge of a wicked conscience. But to the question. I aunswere that to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Iewes which were iustified by faith, circumcision was a seale of the righteousnesse of faith, which is imputed to them, as it was to Abraham with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out merite, or respect of their circumcision.</p>
                  <p>Other pointes of mine ignorance, he saith, are about the holy spirite of promise, whereof Saint Paul speaketh Ephe. 1. which I say is the meane, to make vs parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of the fruites of Christes passion: Item the meane to graffe vs into his bodie: Item, that it worketh in vs faith. In the conclusion, he noteth the ignorance of the Protestantes, where they holde, this spirite promised to <hi>be nothing else, but the gifte of tongues, that is to say, Christs grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test gifte, to be his least gifte.</hi> Out vpon the shamelesse lyer, which of the Protestantes canst thou name, that so hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth? We all holde that the holy spirite of promise, Ephes. 1. is the spirite of adoption, by which we are assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of eternall life. Rom. 8. And as for the spirite, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecyed
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:13044:93"/>
by Ioel, and Iohn Baptist, promised by Christ to be sent after his ascension, we holde not to be specially of the spirit of adoption, which the Apostles &amp; al y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full had before Christes death, and much lesse of that spirit, which your Bishops giue by imposition of hands, in their counterfeit confirmation, which is the spirit of vanitie, whose fruites appeare not in any of the recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers: But we holde that promised gifte of Gods spirit, to be that wonderful reuelation of knowledge and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing &amp; vttera<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce in all states &amp; degrees of true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians generally, beside a great number of particular giftes, not perpetuall, bestowed vpon the Church in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerse speciall members, for the certifying thereof in the first publishing of the gospel. As for your conference of scriptures, whereof you prate so much, is a meere confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of matters of diuerse senses. According to which manner of conference, not weighing the sense of euery place, by the proper circumstances thereof, but follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing onely a sounde and similitude of some wordes, eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie heretike might colour his heresie, were it neuer so absurde, as the Valentinians of whom Irenaeus testifieth, that they patched diuerse sentences together, to make a shewe, as though their heresie were contained in holy write: which was nothing else, but as if a man brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a goodly image of a king in peeces, shoulde of the peece after his owne manner ioyned together, make the image of a dogge, or a foxe or other foule beaste, Iren. lib. 1. Chapt. 1. such is your conference of the spirite of promise, wherewith the faithfull are sealed Ephes. 1. with the spirite of tongues and prophecie which came vppon the twelue, on whom saint Paul layed his hands. Acts 19. The last errour of faith hee chargeth mee, to bee the onely meane, which hee saith, is no meane but a disposition, hee thinketh it sufficiently discouered be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, wherevnto I also thinke that I haue made answere sufficiently.

to receiue, that are not by necessity excluded from it. 1. Pet. 3. Bristow saith, <hi>it is necessarie for all men, but when it cannot be actually had, the effectuall desire of it supplyeth the want: which desire infantes haue not, and therfore onely the actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all hauing of baptisme, doth quicken them in Christ, being dead in Adam.</hi> Touching the saluation of infants of the faithful dying without baptisme, I said nothing but by implica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that there is no such necessitie of Baptisme, that the want of the outwarde sacrament shoulde condemne the seede of the faithful, perteining to gods election &amp; coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, where there is no default, either of contempt or neglect of it. Ro. 9. Ge. 17. And seeing Bristow alloweth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> effectuall desire in men of yeares to supply the want, which yet y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wordes of his text, Iam. 3. of which he taketh colour and authoritie of his doctors, that condemne all vnbaptised infants wil not beare, what reason is it, why he should not extende his supply, vnto the effectuall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire of those infants, parents, and friends, whose faith he acknoledgeth to supplie the want of actuall faith in the infants that are baptised? Beside this hee saith that he did mark wel ynough where I said y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts giue grace according to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> election of God. As though all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants baptised, &amp; so dying be not of Gods electe, or that some be not saued, although they be baptised, &amp; asketh what scripture I haue for this geere? But in deede he bow leth at the wrong marke, for in saying y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the sacramentes tooke effect according to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> faith of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> receiuer and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to gods election, I ment, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> God in baptisme giueth grace to infa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, which haue no actual faith of their owne, according to his eternal electio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in mercy. But whether al infants baptised &amp; so dying be of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber of gods elect, as I do not know, so I wil not contend. But this I know, that if they were not elected of God before the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the world were laide, the receiuing of baptisme, cannot make them Gods elect. Ephe. 1. Where Bristowe vrgeth the saying of saint Peter, 1. Pet. 3. baptisme saueth vs now, it is a weake argument to proue the baptisme of infants, either to saue them all that receiue it, or to condemne all that receiueth it not. For explicating him
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:13044:94"/>
selfe of what baptisme hee speaketh, he addeth, not the putting away of the filth of the flesh, as you woulde say, outwarde washing, which is the externall sacrament, but the interrogation of a good conscience towardes God, which is the thing signified by outwarde washing, and yet not founde in infantes, but in them that haue knowledge, among whom, whosoeuer hath it not, hee shall no more bee saued then any was preserued from drowning that was not in the Arke of Noah. In which Arke one at leaste was saued from bodily drowning, which was not inwardly baptised with the spirite vnto saluation. The figure of whom, I might vrge as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable as Bristow doth of the whole number saued, from drowning, like vnto whom al they that are baptised are brought into the visible Church, although some with Cham, are not members of the mysticall bodie of Christ.

Although Saint Augustine is cleare, they did eate one, and the same that we eate, yet I will proue it by argument out of the Scripture, that which we eate and that which they did eate was, &amp; is Christ, <hi>ergo</hi> they and we eat one and the same meate, euen as they were baptised with the same baptisme: for the church of God neuer had but one baptisme. As for the Capernaites, he saith, I vnderstande not the chapter, Iohn 6. and so onely telleth his fantasie vppon it. But
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:13044:94"/>
what mine vnderstanding is of that chapter, &amp; also mine answere to al popish reasons, falsely gathered thereout: let it appeare in my confutation of Heskins &amp; Sanders.</p>
                  <p>Concerning transubstantiation, I said, Of all follyes this is the greatest, that when the Papistes haue prated neuer so long of the sacrifice of breade and wine, at the laste they wil haue no breade nor wine in their sacrifice. First he saith, this wise argument, proueth the papistes &amp; their fathers the old writers, to be fooles. To this I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plye, those old writers, which are none of the papistes fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, although they supposed Melchizedechs bread and wine, to bee a figure of our sacrament, yet they were not such fooles to denye breade and wine to remaine in our sacrament. But for answere, Bristow saith, that I my selfe confesse, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the drink of the water of the rock, was a figure of our drink in Christs Chalice, although that were wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, &amp; this is no water, no nor made of water, how much more, might Melchizedechs bread and wine be a figure of it, although there bee no breade nor wine in it, consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering it was made of breade and wine, and retaineth the formes of breade and wine? &amp;c. But where hath he this confession of mine? I neuer saide the water of the Rocke was a figure of Christes cuppe, but euen Christs cuppe it selfe, and the very bloud of Christ in a sacrament, to the faithfull, as the wine in the cuppe is to vs. For Christ did euen then feede his true members with his flesh &amp; bloud vnto eternall life.

And therefore to you, as well as to the Manichees Saint Augustine speaketh in the. 4. Chapter of that Booke, in defense of the catholique Church which in his time forbadde not marriage, nor compelled any to virginity. <q>

But if Iouinian taught (as I saide) <hi>Ar.</hi> 45. that such as coulde not conteyne, though they had vowed virginity, should neuerthelesse be married, this was the doctrine of Saint Paul, it is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to marry then to burne. And although Ambrose &amp; Augustine, account such marriage to be adultery, or
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:13044:95"/>
worse then adultery, yet the holy Ghost saith: marriage is honorable in all men and the bedde vndefiled. Heb. 13. And for them that cannot conteine, although they haue vowed virginity, it is better to marry then to burne, 1. Cor. 7. except Bristowe thinke it better to quenche the fier of lust, with fornication and vncleanes: For all men cannot conteine, neither can all men make them selues chaste for the kingdome of God. Math 19, But this conference of Scripture pleaseth not Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowe, for he counteth it none at all, comparing mee for want of conference of scripture to a cloude with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out water: well then, let vs heare what sweete dewe commeth from Bristowes cloude.</p>
                  <p>First hee asketh what it is to burne. Hee aunswe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, to bee troubled with the pricking of the fleshe, say the heretikes. <q>Not so, say wee: for Sainct Paul himselfe was troubled much, with such pricking, 2. Corin. 12. and yet hee was not bidden to marrie, when hee prayed so instantly against it, but it was saide vnto him by Christ, My grace is sufficient for thee, my strength is perfected in infirmitie, &amp;c.</q> First he bely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth vs, whome hee calleth heretikes, to say that to burne, is nothing else but to bee troubled with the pricking of the flesh: for wee holde, there is no praise of virginitie, where there is no naturall prouocation vnto luste. But to burne wee say, is to bee so trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, as men are, that are inflamed with lust, and haue no lawfull meanes to quench the same.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, beholde howe shamefully hee slaundereth Saint Paul, to be much troubled with such pricking of the flesh, where he complayneth of the generall rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the fleshe, against the spirite, the messenger of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan to buffet him, euen that lawe of his members, of which hee complayneth Rom. 7. which brought him captiue vnder the lawe of sinne. As for that pricking, which Bristowe speaketh of to bee so much in a bodie so exercised with afflictions and trauels, with hunger, and fastings, and in a man of such age, as Sainct
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:13044:96"/>
Paul was at that time, when he wrote vnto the Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans the second Epistle, it is altogether incredible. And confessing a generall rebellion of the fleshe, against the spirite vnto all sinne, it is not probable that he should in this place, complaine of that one kinde onely, from which age and weakenesse of bodie woulde priuiledge him, if godly exercise did not ridde him. What is it then to burne, saith Bristowe, <hi>or to be burned? saint Paul himselfe telleth vs, it is, not to containe: If they doe not conteine, let them marrie, for it is better to marrie then to burne, for marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age is honorable and vndefiled, but fornicatours and adulterers God will iudge. The conference whereof is this: Let married folke vse their owne bedde, &amp;c. and let the vnmarried folke enter into marriage, rather then not to containe, to burne, to commit fornication.</hi> So that to burne, not to containe, and to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit fornication, by Bristowes conference, is all one: So that hee which committeth not fornication, although hee bee continually inflamed with filthie luste, yet by Bristowes iudgement, hee burneth not, he is continent, hee is a virgine. Againe, if not to containe, and to burne be nothing else, but to commit fornication, it woulde followe in saint Paules wordes, that men are not commaunded to marrie, before they haue made triall of their incontinence by committing fornication, which seeing it is horrible absurditie: it followeth, that the Apostle to preuent fornication, exhorting men to marrie which containe not, seeing it is better to marrie then to burne, vnderstandeth incontinence and burning, for an infla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mation of lust, without fornication, or actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all filthinesse committed.</p>
                  <p>But whatsoeuer saint Paul speaketh of marriage of them that doe not containe, hee meaneth it of such as haue made no vowe to liue vnmarried. For of those that haue vowed, his sentence is (saith Bristowe) that they incurre damnation if they marrie, because they haue broken their first faith: 1. Tim. which faith with S. Augustine hee vnderstandeth for their last vowe of wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowhood, notwithsta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding, that I shewed, both by confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in the same chapter, by the title of, first, and by

Fulke, it goeth harde with you.</hi> And all this, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I saide such wanton young huswiues, proceede so farre, that at length they forsake widowhood, Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie and al. Saide I onely because they forsake widow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoode?
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:13044:97"/>
No, but because they waxe wanton against Christ, because they haue forsaken the first faith, which is Christianity, and not only because they haue mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, and giuen ouer theyr widowhoode: whereof whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there were a vowe or no, it is not proued. Although it be probable, there was a promise made vnto the Church, because such poore widowes susteined of the Churches almes, were imployed to be helpers 1. Cor. 12. in the office of Deacons. Rom. 16. Considering that it was not sufficient for the sicke and impotent, that men should be collectors and distributers of the almes, but wome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> also were necessary, for diuers seruices about them which were not conuenient for men to exercise. But if I should graunt vnto you, that the first faith here, signifieth the last vowe of widowhoode, yet it folow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not of this place, that all that haue married after rashe vowes made to the contrary, are damned. For Saint Paule speaketh not of them that were constreined by the necessity of incontinencie (which it is not euery mans gift to auoyde) to flye to the generall remedy ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynted by God, for auoyding of fornication, that eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man should haue his wife, and euery woman should haue her husband, without any exception: but only of them he speaketh, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> waxed wanton against Christ, which being liuing to the worlde, were dead to God. What is this against them, which ignorantly rashly or constrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedly made a vowe to performe, that which they were not able? namely continence or chastity, without ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, the breache whereof is not only by mariage, but much more by fornication and vncleanes, yea by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall burning, without actuall filthinesse, which with Saint Paule is incontinence.</p>
                  <p>And yet the Papistes, as though there were no way to breake such vowe, but by marriage, which is the best meane of chastitie, for them that can not be chaste in single life, crie out damnatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> only against married vota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, affirming that infinite whoredoms and vncleanes, are lesse breach of vow, then marriage, and the marriage
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:13044:97"/>
of votaries to be no marriage. Yet Saint Ambrose, who counteth it an adulterie against Christe, for a vowed virgine to marrie, counteth the marriage of such a one, in respect of her bodily husbande to be lawfull matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, and a much lesse fault, to enter into mariage, then once to committe fornication. <hi>Ad Virg. Laps. Cap.</hi> 5. And more plainly Saint Augustine which counteth the mariages of such, of whom the Apostle speaketh to be worse then adulteries, in respect of the breache of theyr vowe, made to Christ: yet counteth them to be mariages, and no adulteries, and detesteth the separati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of such married persons, <hi>De bono Vid<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Where Allen railing against our Bishops, and as he termeth our disordered newe ministery, saith, that ere euer they be well warmed in theyr benisices, they must for the most part, as it were <hi>Annexum ordini,</hi> haue a wife. I answered, Belyke Saint Paule taketh marriage to be so annexed to the order of an ecclesiasticall minister, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he neuer describeth the perfect paterne of a Bishop or Deacon, but one of the first pointes is, that he be the hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band of one wife. Bristowe saith, I alledge the text to salue our Bishops itching lust: and more blasphemously speaketh Allen against our ministers marriage, whom yet they account to be but laie men. Where are they nowe that saye mariage is a naughty thing? But con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the terme of <hi>Annexum ordini,</hi> although I saide in derision therof, Belyke, &amp;c. as before, yet I ment not, that it was necessary for euery perfect minister to be married, but that none is more perfect, then they that are married. Notwithstanding some men considering that the Apostle requireth hospitality, that is the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable entertainment of poore straungers, as a speciall vertue in a Bishoppe or minister of the Church, thinke marriage to bee more conuenient then sole life, for that degree, because diuerse partes of hospitality, of whiche Saint Paule maketh, the washinge of the Saintes feete, one, and suche like, are not conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient but for women to exercise, whome it were
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:13044:98"/>
inconuenient, that a Bishop should kepe in his house, and not be a maried man. But Bristowe will teache me to vnderstand, what Saint Paule meaneth by the hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band of one wife, by conference of that place. 1. Tim. 5. where he will haue a widowe to be chosen, such a one, <hi>quae fuit vnius viri vx<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Indeede Bristowe: I learne by this conference, that Saint Paule who knewe how to write his minde in Greeke, although he had not spoken expresly of the behauiour of Bishops, and Deacons wiues. 1. Tim. 3. yet vsing the present temps, in speaking of Bishops, El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and Deacons, to be the husbande of one wife, &amp; the preterperfect temps, in speaking of widowes, which haue had one husband did meane, that he requireth such a one to be made Bishop, Elder or Deacon, which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently hath a wife: and not which had a wife, that at the time of their election were deade, as the widowes hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bande. It behoueth a Bishop <gap reason="foreign">

Therefore a Bishoppe, Elder, or Deacon, may be he, that hath a wife, presently, and not he that hath had one which is dead, onely. Moreouer I learne by conference of that place, 1. Tim. 5. that Polygamie, which is many wiues at one time, is forbidden a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop, and not second mariage, as it hathben commonly and of olde time taken of many: seeing there is no reason to exclude a poore widow from almes and office in the Church, that hath liued continently with more husbands then one, so that she haue kept her to one at one time: But it is not meete, that she should be elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to an office in the Church, which hath bene an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulteresse, or vnlawfully diuorced from her husband,
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:13044:98"/>
hath maried an other, although she may be releeued by almes, if she be penitent.</p>
                  <p>But Bristowe would haue men to marke it well, that yet neuer from the Apostles time, to this day, any one Bishoppe or Prieste, that is confessed to haue beene a good one, did marrie afterwardes, no not Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinian him selfe. Hee would faine if he durst, say that no Bishoppe or Priest had a wife: but that were easily refelled out of Eusebius and all auncient histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. Clemens Alex. Strom. lib. 3. sheweth that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles Peter and Philip, had wiues and did beget chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. Also he saith of Saint Paule, <q>
                        <hi>Vnius quoque vxoris virum utique admittit, seu hoc Presbyter, seu Diaconus, seu Laicus viens matrimonio citra reprehensionem.</hi> He alloweth the husband of one wife, whether he be Elder, or Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con, or lay man, vsing matrimony without reprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</q> Seeing therefore he putteth no difference in respect of matrimony, betweene a Laye man, and a Cleargie man, it is plaine, that it was as lawfull for Elders and Deacons to marrie in his time, as for Lay men. Againe the same Clemens saith against them that denyed the lawfulnesse of generation, after he had cited diuerse textes of Scripture. <q>
                        <hi>Quid autem ad haec dicunt, qui in legem, &amp;c.</hi> But what say they to these thinges, which inueygh against the lawe, and against matrimony, as that it was graunted onely in the law, &amp; not also in the new Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? What can they say to these lawes that are made, which abhorre sowing and generation, when he maketh a Bishop also, him that ruleth his house wel, guide of the Church? And the marriage of one woman buildeth the house of our Lorde.</q> Therefore he saith, that all thinges are cleane to the cleane. Seeing therefore that marriage is as free by his iudgement by the new Testament, as by the lawe, and Aarons Priestes, were at libertie to marrie, no man neede to doubt, but the Bishops and Elders of the Churche of Christe, are at as great libertie, and v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing their libertie in his time, were allowed for good ones.</p>

                        <hi>Presbyteros verò, qui matrimonis contraxerunt, sperni debere dicunt.</hi> They saie that Elders or Priests which haue ioyned them selues in matrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, ought to be despised.</q> Therefore these catholique Bishops thought those Priests good ones, which did ioyne them selues in matrimony, &amp; so they made their Canon: <q>
                        <hi>Si quis discernit Presbyterum coniugatum, &amp;c.</hi> If any man make difference of a married Priest, as though by occasion of his marriage, he ought not to offer, and doth therfore absteine from his oblation, let him be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cursed.</q> Cap. 4. Of Deacons also the Ancyrane councell decreeth Cap. 10. <q>
                        <hi>Diaconi quicunque, &amp;c.</hi> Whosoeuer be ordeyned Deacons, if at the same time when they were ordeined, they protested, saying that they would be ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in marriage, because they could not so continue, if afterwarde they haue married wiues, let them remaine in the ministerie, because the Bishop hath giuen them licence: But so many as haue helde their peace, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken imposition of handes professing continencie, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwarde be ioyned in marriage, ought to ceasse from the ministerie.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Finally the Decree of Pope Stephanus is cited Dist, 31. <hi>Aliter se</hi> by Gratian and Iuo: lib 4. allowing the tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the orientall Churches for marriage of theyr Church ministers. <q>
                        <hi>Aliter se Orientalium, &amp;c.</hi> The tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Easterne Churches hath it otherwise, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise is the tradition of this holy Church of Rome. For the Priests, Deacons, and Subdeacons of their Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, are coupled in marriage: but none of the Priestes of this Church, from the Subdeacon vnto the Bishoppe hath licence to enter into mariage.</q> It were hard if there were neuer a good one among all the Cleargie of the East Churches, since the Apostles time, which haue ben married and yet are.</p>
                  <p>To conclude, I trust it is apparant to the indifferent reader, that such texts of Scripture as I alledged in those
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:13044:99"/>
two bookes, which Bristow vndertaketh in this confuse manner to confute, were rightly applyed, and without all violence or wresting, doe proue sufficiently that for which they were called to witnesse. And as for the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish conference of Scriptures, wherof Bristowe once a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine with great lothsomnesse doeth bragge, how sound it is, you may perceiue by this example, &amp; taste, giuen by him in this Chapter. Wherefore I maruell much what learned ministers of our church these were, whom Bristow affirmeth (being in number more then a dozen, and diuerse of no vulgar wittes) by their onely hearing of your conference of scriptures to haue become papists. By like some vagabonde, irregular, and vnhonest per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, being depriued of their ministerie for their vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly behauiour, haue sought fauour among them by reuolting, or at least counterfaiting to be reuolted to papistrie, when they be of no religion, commended by Bristow for their wittes, but neither for their honestie nor learning.</p>

               </p>
               <p>I confesse not the doctors to be yours in very manye points, nor simply in fewe pointes, nor all in any point <note place="margin">Fulke.</note> of controuersie, but graunting that for a fewe errours, which you haue common with them, in which you al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so farre exceede them, as in prayers for the dead, prayers to saintes, some superstitious or superfluous ceremonies, I affirme that in the greatest and chiefest pointes of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouersie, they are either all with vs, or not one against vs.</p>

                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

                  <note place="margin">Bristowe.</note>
               </p>
               <p>His first reason is, because I sayde: wee stande for au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie <note place="margin">Fulke.</note> onely to the iudgement of the holy scriptures, which scriptures in the chapter going before, he hath sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied. But how he hath satisfied them, let the indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent readers iudge. And seeing the Papistes offer to sta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to their iudgement in all things, and wee refuse them not as witnesses vnto the truth, in most things, he is not discharged in reason of answering my doctors.</p>
               <p>His second reason is, for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I do answere all mine own doctors for him, if it be wel considered: &amp; what is your consideration? In that I confesse them to haue helde with you the very same points, for which wee must bee condemned (no remedie) as differing from the doctors in the greatest pointes. What are those I pray you? Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowe answereth. For why doeth he saye, that we are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the honor of God, &amp; against the offices of Christ, but because wee holde inuocation of saints, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipping of their reliques? yes sir, for other more grosse idolatrie and defacing of the kingdome, priesthod, and propheticall office of Christe, and for holding these two pointes more absurdly and grossely then any of the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors did. Againe, why doth he say, that we are against the authoritie of Gods worde, but because we hold with traditions, as the doctors did? I aunswere, the doctors held with no traditions that were proued to be against the written worde of God, they made not the decrees of Councels and Popes, of equall autoritie with the worde of God as you do.</p>
               <p>But of one of the greatest pointes he repeateth my wordes, in which I say expressely: I confesse with M. Allen, that the old writers, not only knewe, but also haue expressed the value of our redemption by Christ, in such wordes, as it is not possible that the Popish satisfaction can stande with them. And yet on the other side (saith Bristowe) see what followeth immediatly. Against the value of which redemption, if they haue vttered any
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:13044:100"/>
thing, by the worde of satisfaction, or any thing else, we may lawfully reiect their authoritie, not onely though they be doctors of the church, but also if they were an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels from heauen. But what I pray you concludeth Bristowe of these two sayings. His wordes followe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly: <hi>So that nowe we no more neede to defende against him, that wee are not contrarie to the doctors, then that the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors are not contrary to them selues.</hi> As though it were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible for men to be contrarie to themselues. And yet I say no more of them, then of the angels, that they are contrary to the trueth in this point, but that if they were, wee might reiect them as lawfully as the angels, if they brought another gospell. Last of all he sayth: <hi>Wee neede not defend that we are contrarie to our selues in the same. For in what wordes the doctors speake thereof, the same do wee.</hi> Neither is the antecedent true, nor if it were, doth the argument followe. For you will not saye as the olde writers doe, that through the redemption of Christ, a man is iustified before God by faith onely. without respect of his workes or merites. And where you vse the doctors wordes, you either vse them in a contrary sense, or else elude them with additions &amp; di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctions, neither grounded on the Scriptures nor on the olde doctors, but inuented out of your owne he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticall braines. After which manner it is easie to defe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d that they say nothing against any heresie, which they doe not condemne by name, although they plainly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouche the trueth, against such errour.</p>

               <p>As touching antichrist, I sayd, Pur. 249. The seat of antichrist was apointed to be set vp in the Latin church <note place="margin">Fulke.</note> according to the reuelation of Saint Iohn, and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of Ireneus, who iudged y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Lateinos was y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> beasts name spoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Apoc. 13. To this Bristo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> answereth, here are two ragged conclusio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s. The first, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist was appointed to be set vp in the Latin church, <hi>ergo</hi> the Pope of Rome is antichrist. No sir, I made no such argument, but of the authoritie of Irenaeus I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, that the seat of antichrist was appointed to be set vp in the Latine church, and therfore superstition was somewhat forwarder then in the Greeke church. The o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther conclusion (sayeth Bristowe) is this: Irenaeus iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged that Lateinos should be the name of antichrist, (as Iesus was and is the name of Christ) <hi>ergo,</hi> he iudged that antichrist was apointed to be set vp in the Latin church: I answere, the antecedent is yours Master Bristowe, and not mine. For I sayd not, that Irenaeus iudged that La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teinus should be the name of antichrist, as Iesus is the name of Christ, as though antichrist should be a singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar man: For Irenaeus sayeth it, in respect of his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, which should be in the Latine part of the world: <hi>V<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> vocabulum.</hi> It is verie like, because the moste true king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome hath that name, which was the kingdome of the Romanes. Therefore wee must seeke in the Romane kingdome for antichist: in which kingdome haue reig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned hitherto Emperours and Popes. Emperours haue beene heathenish &amp; Christened: the heathenish it could not be, because antichrist must sit in the Church, and they were altogether without. Of the Emperours, some were Catholike, and some hereticall. The Catholike no man will charge: the hereticall Emperors were no false Prophets, as antichrist must be a false teacher, that with lying signes and wonders shall deceiue the world:
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:13044:101"/>
wherefore it remaineth that of all that haue hitherto reigned in the Latine Empire, the Pope must bee that principall antichrist. For Caluine and Luther, whome Bristowe fondly nameth to be in the Latine Churche) neuer bare rule in the Latine kingdome. Bristowes last refuge is, that Irenaeus did not so iudge. Hee onely sayeth, it is very like to be so. I aske no more but his iudgement of the likelyhod: For I knowe hee reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth other names, which haue in them the same num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, as Euan, Teitan, and in the ende will pronounce certeinly of none, holding, that it is better to expect the fulfilling of the Prophecy, then to pronounce rashly of any. But seeing antichrist is alreadie reuealed, and all the prophecy of his apostasie and seduction accompli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed, wee doubt not to ioyne to that auncient likely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hod of Irenaeus, the later likelyhodes of the same name agreeing in number with <hi>Lateinos</hi> in Greeke, <hi>Romiith</hi> in Hebrewe, not neglecting <hi>Ecclesia Italica.</hi> The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent of all which names, signifying the region, the citie, the kingdom, beare so harde vpon the Pope &amp; the popish church of Rome, that Bristowe, though he laye both his shoulders to it, shall neuer be able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moue it.</p>
               <p>Secondly I sayde of Hierom, Pur. 373. Hee was not such a slaue to the church of Rome, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> whatsoeuer plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the bishops of that see, he was readie to accept: For then he would not haue beene so bold to call Rome the purple whore of Babylon, <hi>Praef. ad Paul. in lib. Didym.</hi> Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow replyeth: as though when he calleth Rome so, or when Augustine calleth it the Westerne Babylon, they meane the church of Rome. I sayed not they meane the church of Rome, as it was in their time, but that an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist shoulde sit at Rome, whome the scripture sayeth, must sit in the temple or Church of God, 2. Thes. 2. Neither doeth Augustine meane it of the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, but of antichrist, which should arise in the Romane empire. Neither doeth Hierom meane of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Paganisme of Rome, that remained in his time, which in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> place by Brist. cited <hi>ad Marcell. Ep.</hi> 16. he testifieth to haue ben tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnder
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:13044:102"/>
feete, but of the purple whore sitting aloft, vpon the rose coulered beast, of the wine of whose fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, all nations were made drunken, of the blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie written in her forehead, of the seuen hilles &amp;c. al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though in his tyme, he confesse there was the churche of God, the tryumphe of the Apostles and Martyrs, &amp;c. <hi>&amp; gentilitate calcata</hi> &amp; Gentilitie being troaden vnder feete, the Christian name dayly lifting it selfe aloft. But that Hierom in doubtes did seeke for resolution of Damasus bishop of Rome, and that all other must like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise doe. Bristowe citeth his Epistle <hi>ad Damasum. To<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                     </gap>.</hi> 2. in which he consulteth with Damasus, whether hee should vse the name of Hippostasis, and saith further, that whosoeuer gathereth not with Damasus, doth scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: that is to saye, whoso is not Christes is antichrists, I aunswere, all this was well, so long as Damasus was a Catholike bishop, but that Saint Hierome was not rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die to accept whatsoeuer it pleased the bishop of Rome, it is manifest by that he affirmeth Liberius to haue subscribed to the Arrians, in <hi>Catal. script.</hi> which he would neuer haue done, if he had thought it impossible for the bishop of Rome to erre, or necessarie for him to followe the bishop of Romes doctrine in all things. The place cited <hi>ad Damasum</hi> with answere to it, is in my confuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Saunders Rocke, Cap. 15. And therefore the saying of Leo Epist. 89. That Christ tooke Peter into the participation of the vndiuided vnitie, proueth not, that it is all one to be Peters and to be Christes, when Peter erreth from Christe, and much lesse, that it is all one (as Bristowe sayeth) to be in vnitie with Peter and his suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessours, meaning the Popes, and to be in vnitie with Christ, from whome, not onely all Popes in matter now of controuersie doe. But diuerse of the Bishops &amp; Popes of Rome haue beene deuided into horrible and confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed errours and heresies, of both partes: as Gentilisme, Arrianisme, Eu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Againe, I saide Pur. 320. Which of your prelates wil follow Ambrose in his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mentarie vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Apocalipse,
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:13044:102"/>
where he interpreteth the whore of Babylon to be the citie of Rome? whose wordes Bristow wil recite for me. This whore doth betoken in some places Rome in spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial, which then did persecute y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> church of God: in some places in generall, the citie of the diuel, that is to saye, the whole body of the reprobat. Bristowe asketh if it be not a perillous point to touch the citie of Rome in saint Iohns time, when it did persecute the church of Rome? As though S. Iohn telleth a storie of his owne time, and not a prophecy of the time to come. Ambrose therfore, or whosoeuer writeth that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mentarie, interpreteth that prophecy, Cap. 17. to be fulfilled of the citie of Rome: which was not onely of persecution, but of seduction. But the vndoubted Ambrose (if you remember, sayeth Bristowe) of the church of Rome sayeth: In al things I couet to followe the Romane church, <hi>De sac. lib. 3. Cap.</hi> 1. but yet that he was not bounde to followe the church of Rome, he sayeth immediately after: <q>
                     <hi>Sed tamen &amp; nos homine sensum habemus, &amp;c.</hi> But yet we being men, haue vnderstanding. Therefore, that which is more rightly obserued elsewhere, we also do rightly obserue. We follow the Apostle Peter him selfe, we sticke vnto his deuotion, what doth the church of Rome answere to this? Verily, Peter him selfe, which was a priest of the church of Rome, is author to vs of this assertion.</q> In this Chapter he noteth an error of the church of Rome in y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they vsed not to wash mens feete in baptisme. Vniustly indeede, he vrgeth that ceremonie as necessarie, but yet he sheweth, that his iudgement was, that the church of Rome might receiue a custome contrarie to y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> scripture.</p>
               <p>Beside this (saith Bristow) he calleth Peter the first &amp; the foundation in the verie same place, where say you, Pur. 320 he affirmeth, that Peter is not the foundation. Howsoeuer I deale with my reader, you deale vnfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully with me: for my wordes are these: He affirmeth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> not Peter, but the faith &amp; the confession of Peter, is the foundation of the church: and that the primacy of Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was a primacie of faith, not of honour, of confession, not of autoritie or higher order. <hi>De incaern. dom. Ca. 4. &amp;</hi> 5.
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:13044:103"/>
Ambrose his words are, Cap. 4. <q>
                     <hi>Vos autem &amp;c.</hi> But what do you say of mee? Immediatly (Peter) being not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mindful of his place, he exercised the primacy: The pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macie of confessing truely, not of honor, the primacie of faith, not of order or degree. And Cap. 5. Faith is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the church. For it was not said of Peters flesh, but of his faith, that the gates of death shal not preuailc against it, his confession ouercommeth hel.</q> The former of these places, Brist. corrupteth by adding this worde, worldly, to the words of Ambrose, honor, &amp; degree, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> though Ambrose had meant, that Peter excelled in eccle siasticall honor &amp; degree, being equal to his fellowes in worldly honour and degree. But such folly was farr fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Ambrose, to say Peter was not better then the rest of the Apostles in worldly honor &amp; degree, when neither Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter nor the rest had any worldly honour or degree of dignitie at all. But he expresseth wherein all his prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie was, when he sayeth, he was first in confession, first in protestation of his faith, not being therefore of greater honor or higher degree then his fellowes, who all helde the same faith and confession. And this of Peters per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, neuer a worde of his successours, which yet are not onely the bishops of Rome, when they were at the best, but all other bishops are the successors of the Apostles, Hierom, Euagrius which succession cannot be esteemed by places, in which the Apostles sat in person, but by au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie of teaching receiued from them with soundnes of doctrine.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To the later place</hi> (Bristow saith) <hi>the diuel may preuaile a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the fleshe of a Pope: but his faith, but his confession (as well in all articles that be nowe in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trouersie, as in those at that time) wil stand, when they shall all be sonke downe into their due place.</hi> But Saint Ambrose speaketh not of euery bishop of Romes faith and confession, but onely of the singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar faith and confession of Peter: Thou art Christe the sonne of the liuing God, which is against all sectes and heresies. <q>
                     <hi>Dies me citius &amp;c.</hi> the day should sooner faile mee then the names of heretikes and diuers sectes. Yet this faith is generall against them all, that Christ is the
<pb facs="tcp:13044:103"/>
sonne of God both sempiternall of his father, and also borne of the virgine.</q> Let nowe the reader iudge, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of vs hath dealt more faithfully with Saint Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brose.</p>
               <p>Fourthly he gathereth, that I saye in diuerse places: that Irenaeus, Polycrates, Dionysius, Alexandrinus, Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prianus, the Councell of Africa, and Socrates the histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riographer, did preach or write against the Popes autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, when it first began to aduance it selfe, in Victor, Cornelius Stephanus, Anastasius, Innocentius, Zozi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus, Bonifacius &amp; Celestinus.</p>
               <p>To this Bristow answereth: <hi>First, that all these Popes by my confession were of the true church, therfore I am against my selfe in making other Popes to be antichrist, for claiming such authoritie as these did.</hi> Whereto I replye, the former bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops did but begin a little in comparison to discouer the mysterie of iniquitie, those later Popes that are an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrists, did openly shewe them selues in the temple of God as God, and therefore great difference. Secondly, Bristowe answereth, that all those writers did commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate with those Popes: therefore our separation cannot be excused. I replye, their ambitious vsurpation tended not to heresie, and therfore they were content to admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish them, but the latter Popes, from whome we dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, are fallen into open heresie and apostasie. Thirdly, he saith, that no one of these writers wrote against the Popes authoritie, as he wil shewe of Irenaeus, Polycrates, Dionysius, &amp; Cyprian, Cap. 10. in 28. demaunde, where I will shewe that they did write against such vniust au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie as those bishops did claime.</p>
               <p>Yet concerning Saint Cyprian in this place, hee say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that hee exhorteth Cornelius to bee as stout in not loosing certeine African heretikes, as their owne bishop had beene in bynding of them. By which hee woulde haue men thinke, that Cornelius had authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to vndoe, that which Cyprian had done, as the Pope in these dayes taketh vpon him. But Cyprian yeldeth to no such authoritie, but maruelleth that Corneli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us was anye thing moued with the threatening of

                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>, vnder pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence that Cyprian had not written to him immediatly of the constitution of Fortunatus a counterfeit bishop by a fewe heretikes, counting it sufficient that Corne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius knewe before, that they were excommunicated by the bishops of Africa, saying of their gadding to Rome, <q>

But there to plead their cause, wher both they may haue accusers &amp; witnesses of their crime, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept to a fewe desperate men &amp; castawayes, the authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the bishops placed in Africa seemeth to be lesse, which haue alreadie iudged of them, &amp; by the weight of their iudgement condemned their conscience bounde with the snares of many trespasses. Their cause already hath beene heard: the sentence is alreadie pronounced of them, neither is it congruent to the censure of priests to be reprehended by Leuits of mouable &amp; inconstant minde, &amp;c.</q> You see that Cyprian meant nothing lesse, than to giue Cornelius bishop of Rome authoritie, to reuerse the sentence of the bishops of Africa, whose au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie he iudged to be nothing lesse then the bishops of Rome or other places.</p>
               <p>Moreouer Bristow saith that <hi>Cyprian doth also note in S. Stephan some little negligence, but much more wilful obreption, in those two lapsed bishops of Spaine, Basilides &amp; Martialis, who had concealed from him the trueth, that in their supplication they should haue expressed, which because they did not, he saith well, that their restitution by the Pope could not stand them in steed against their former deposition by the bishop<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>As concerning the Councels of Africa &amp; Mileuis, (sayeth Bristowe) the question between them and those other fiue Popes, was not about the matters of the vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersall church, as for example, matters of faith. No was, is not the Popes authoritie of you counted a matter of faith, and of the vniuersall church? although they agreed in all other matters. But Bristow shameth not to say, it was not about the Popes authoritie in receiuing of bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops appeales, but what order the Nicene Councel had taken therein. As though that counterfeit Canon was not alledged, to iustifie the Popes authoritie in recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing such appeales. But there are examples you saye, of appeales, and namely of the Patriarkes of Alexandria and Constantinople, but of which Patriarks &amp; to whom you shewe not. yea, S. Augustine him selfe, you say. v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth it as a plea: That Cecilianus was readie to pleade his cause before other churches out of Africa. Ep. 162.
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:13044:105"/>
This prooueth not, that Cecilianus, although trusting in the innoce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cy of his cause, refused no indifferent iudges: yet that he appealed to the Church of Rome, and least of all to the singular iudgment of the Bishop of Rome, but to all other churches. And the appeales that were made in his cause were made to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Emperour, and from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Bishop of Rome, being once delegate of the Emperour to heare his cause with other Bishops, vnto him the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conde time, who gaue <hi>aliud uidicium Arelatense aliorum sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licet Episcoporum &amp;c.</hi> an other iudgement of A relate, of other Bishops, as it is plaine in the same Epistle.</p>

                  <hi>But such appeales were lawfull,</hi> (saith Bristow) <hi>by the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell Sardicense cap. 7. in the same Carthage councell cap. 3. whose authoritie none of those Africane Bishops did denie, for the same Bishops were of it, that were of the Nicene: and Sainct Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine chap. 7. did expresly admitte in the Canon of the inferiori appealing from their own<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Therefore it appeareth, that the Canon of bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops appeales to Rome being first forged as a Canon of the Nicene Councell, when it could not find any setling there, was afterwarde foysted in the Sardicen Councell.</p>

Verily both our and your chearfulnes should be now more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, neither might seeme too much hasted and ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speedy which as yet had gon before aswell of one to bee heard as of one that is alredy heard. Surely when our ho ly brother, and fellow bishop, Faustinus came vnto vs, we gathered a Councell, and beleeued that he was ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore sent with him, that as by his helpe he had beene be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore restored to the Eldership, so rrow by his labour he might haue beene purged of so great crimes as are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected by the Tabracenes, whose so great &amp; so heynous wicked factes, the examinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the course of our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell hath found out; that the saide persons hoped for pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronage rather then iudgment, and the aide of a defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der rather then the iustice of an examiner. For first of al, how much he withstoode y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whole congregatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, offering dayly diuers iniuries as one that mainteined y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> priuile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of the Romaine Church, and that would be receiued into communion of vs, whom thy holynes (beleeuing that he had appealed, which he was not able to proue) had restored to the communion, which neuerthelesse was not lawfull, and thou maist know also better by the reading of the actes. Notwithstanding holding a most painfull iudgment by the space of three dayes, when being verie much troubled, wee inquired of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerse thinges obiected vnto him, GOD the
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:13044:106"/>
righteous iudge, strong, and long suffering, to our great profite hath cutte off either the delayes of our fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe Byshop Faustinus, or the craftie shiftes of Appi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arius himselfe, by which hee went about to hide his filthinesse, not to bee named. For his more vile and stinking obstinacie being subdued, by which he would haue ouerwhelmed so great and filthie myre with im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudencie, our GOD strayning his conscience, and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishing euen vnto men, the secrete crimes which he did alreadie condemne, which were as it were wrapped close in his hearte, sodainely this craftie denyer brake forth into confession of all the wicked factes that were obiected against him: And at length, of his owne accorde conuicted himselfe of all those incredible re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proches, and turned into mourning euen our hope by which wee both beleeued and wished that hee might haue beene purged of so shamefull blottes, but that hee mitigated this our heauinesse, with one onely com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort that both he discharged vs from the labour of lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger inquirie, and also prouided for his woundes such a medicine as it was, although it were by vnwilling con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, and his owne conscience striuing against it, our Lorde and brother. Therefore reseruing our dutie of due salutation wee earnestly desire you that henceforwarde you doe not easily admitte vnto your hearing, such as come from hence, nor that you wil any more receiue into communion those y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> are excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated by vs, because your worship may easily perceiue, that this matter is also defined in the Nicene Councell. For although the prouision seeme to be there made of inferiour Clarkes, or lay men, yet howe much more woulde it, that the same shoulde be obserued concerning Byshops: that being suspended from the communion in their prouince, they shoulde not seeme by your holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, either ouerhastily or vnduely, to be restored to the communion. Also let your holynesse refuse the Iewde refuges, or shiftes of Priestes, and other clarkes as it is meete for you to do, because that by no decree of the fathers, this is taken away from the Church of
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:13044:106"/>
Africa, and the decrees of Nice haue most manifestly committed them, whether they bee clarkes of inferior degree, or whether they be Bishops themselues vnto their owne Metropolitanes. For most wisely and iust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they foresawe, that all businesses should be ended in their owne places where they began, and that the grace of the holy ghost, shoulde not be wanting to euery pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince, whereby equitie by the priests of Christ might both be seene wisely, &amp; also held most constantly, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially because it is graunted to euerie man, if he shalbe offended with the iudgement of them that shall heare his cause, to appeale to the Councels of his owne pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince, or else to a generall councell. Except peraduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture there be any man which beleeueth, that our GOD can inspire the iustice of examination and triall, into any one man whomsoeuer, and doth denie the same to innumerable priestes gathered together in councell.

               <p>Thus haue I set downe the whole Epistle, though it be somwhat long, that the English reader may see, and iudge of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whole matter in controuersie betweene y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops of Rome, and all the bishops, of all the countries of Africa which was y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> third part of the world, and howe truely Bristow first denyeth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> forgerie which was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by copies sent from Alexandria &amp; Constantinople, out of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> authentical copie of the Councell of Nice.

But I am moste ridiculous, in Bristowes iudgement, where I alledge Socrates the Nouatian, speaking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Pope Celestinus, for taking away the Nouatians Churches in Rome, and counting it a point of forren Lordshippe, not of Priesthoode. Thus the Papistes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fame such as write plainely against them, Eusebius they make an Arrian, Socrates a Nouatian, euen as he diffa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Saint Paule in the last Chapter, with much pric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of bodily lust. But what cause hath hee to charge Socrates with the heresie of Nouatus? He alledgeth none at al, neither is he able euer to proue the crime. In deed Socrates liuing at such time, as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Nouatians ioyning in faith of the holy Trinitie with the Catholikes against the Arrians, Macedonians, and such other heretikes, were not so odious, speaketh lesse sharply of them, then of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther heresies. Yet alwayes he accounteth them among heretikes: As <hi>Lib. 5. Cap. 19. Ab eo tempore quo Nouatiani, &amp;c.</hi> Euer since the time that the Nouatians departed from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Church. Is it like that Socrates was a Nouatian, when he confesseth that they were departed from the Church? Likewise hauing spoken of the diuisions that were in the Catholike Churche, he commeth to speake of the schismes that were among heretikes, and nameth the Arrians, Nouatians, Macedonians and Eunomians <hi>Supr. &amp; Trip. Hist. lib. 9. cap.</hi> 36. Thus much for the credite of Socrates: nowe to the matter: where Bristowe saith, he counted it a point of forren Lordship to expell y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uatians, &amp;c it is false. But he sheweth the cause, why Celestinus coulde not preuaile to doe any good with them, his wordes are: <hi>Verumillos invidia corripuit Romano episcopai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Last of all whereas I alledged againste the Popes supremacie, the decree of the Aphrican councell Cap. 6. that no Bishoppe of the first see, should be called highest Priest, or Prince of Priests, but onely Bishop of the first see: Bristowe saith, it perteyneth onely to the Primates of Affrica, and concerneth not the titles, much lesse the primacie of the Bishop of Rome. But the trueth is, that it was made specially to represse the ambition of the Romane Prelates, and therfore in the end of the Canon, as it is conteined in the decrees, <hi>Dist. 99. cap.

But the Affricanes (saith Bristowe) as appeareth in Saint Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stines workes, neuer called him Bishop of the first see, but Bishop of the Apostolike see. Although Saint Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stines workes can not bee witnesse, howe the Affri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canes called him alwayes: yet what gayneth the Pope or Bristowe for him by this? What if they neuer called him primate or Bishop of the first see? (for other inferior Bishoppes were called Bishoppes of the second see.) The councel forbadde them to giue any other titles of au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie beside this Bishop of the first see, it did not binde them that they should of necessitie call them by that title. For it was sufficient to cal them the Bishops of Carthage, of Alexandria, of Rome, of Antioche, &amp;c. And that they called the Romane Prelate Bishop of the Apostolike see of Rome, they gaue him no more au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie ouer the Churches of Affrica, then when they

called the Bishop of Hierusalem, Antioch, Ephesus, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth, or of any other Churches founded by the Apostles Bishoppe of the see Apostolike. Thus my Doctours (for any thing Bristowe can bring) remaine constant witnesses of my side, against the vsurped and Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian authoritie of the Bishop of Rome.</p>

                  <p>I quoted Ambrose, Origen, and Cyprian, for iustification by faith only. To this Bristowe answereth <note place="margin">Fulke.</note> first generally, that hath satisfied these Doctors Cap. 8. Par. 4. that they meane a man may be iustified by faith, although before he was a Christian Catholike, he did no good works. But he cannot so escape, for they speake not only of the first conuersion, of a man, but of iustification vnto saluation of euerie faithfull man, according to the example of Abraham and Dauid, who both had good workes, yet were not iustified by them before God, but by theyr faith only. And Saint Paule expressely saith of himselfe, and all other Christians that were in his time, &amp; that shalbe in all times, that the example of Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams iustification is the example of his and their iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication: Rom. 4. Therefore his faith was imputed to him for righteousnesse, and it is not written for him onely, that it is imputed to him, but also for vs, vnto who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it shalbe imputed, which beleeue in him that raised vp Iesus from the dead, who was deliuered for our sinnes, and raysed againe for our iustification.

In the meane time, I must proue that these fathers speake generally of all Christians and the only way of iustification, and not of newe conuerts only, and of the instinct of their baptisme or newe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersion onely, but that they are iustified by faith vnto eternall saluation.</p>

By all which it is cleare, that the Apostle iudgeth, rightly that a man is iustified by faith without the workes of the lawe.</q> See you not that iustification is not only to sett a man in free will, discharged of his sinnes committed before baptisme, but continueth with him vnto saluation?

the sinfull woman, or whether they haue workes of the lawe without the faith of Christe, as the Pharisee, or whether they haue neuer so many workes and vertues with the faith of Christe, as the Apostle Paule, there is but one way of iustification, for all men, which is by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of sinnes, through faith onely. Where Cyprian saith: that faith onely profiteth <hi>Ad Quirin. Cap.</hi> 42. Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowe saith, he meaneth that faith profiteth, and without faith nothing profiteth. I confesse in deede he mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth all that Bristowe saith, and more too, namely that faith profiteth, therefore workes do not profite vnto iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification, as appeareth by that testimony of Scripture which he citeth, to proue his saying: Abraham belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued God, and it was imputed to him for iustice. Gen. 15. By which Saint Paule proueth, that Abraham was iustified by faith without workes, and yet Abraham was not voyde of good workes. Out of the Booke <hi>De duplici Martyrio</hi> I cited Cyprians saying: That he beleeueth not in God at all, which placeth not the trust of all his felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in him only. To this Bristowe answereth without shame, that the Booke <hi>De duplici Martyrio</hi> is thought to be supposition, coyned by Erasmus: as though it were credible that Erasmus being such an vtter enemy to all forgery and supposition, would himselfe counterfet a booke vnder the name of Cyprian. But Bristowe dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bting, least he may be conuicted by auncient copies of this booke, remaining in Libraries, as no doubt, but that he may, for a second aunswer saith, <hi>That this sentence is of it selfe Catholike inough. For to trust Gods giftes, as in the Catholike faith, and good workes that he worketh in vs, also to trust in Saints: to trust in these, I say, as they be his, is to trust in him onely.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I say, (sayeth Bristowe,) what neede we further witnesse or reason? But Christe telling a parable, against them that trusted in themselues, that they were righteous, telleth of a Pharisee, that trusted in his woorkes, as they were the giftes of GOD, to whome hee gaue thankes for them. Luke. 18.
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:13044:110"/>
This auctority of Bristowe is inough to discharge Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lagius, Celestinus, and all the rable of freewill men, who trusted in nothing, but that was the gift of God, and so acknowledged by them, in so much as they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed, that a man was iustified by the grace of God, when he was iustified by his owne workes, because God gaue free will, and power to worke well, also a law by keeping whereof, men might be righteous. Finally this rule of Bristowe, will iustifie a man, which putting his trust in Angels, worshippeth them as Gods Angells, yea which putting his trust in any of Gods creatures, trusteth in him alone. So that nothing is so singular, but he can make it generall, nor any thing so generall, but he can restrayne it at his pleasure.</p>
                  <p>Now y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Ambrose also extendeth the grace of iustifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by faith only vnto eternal saluation, it is manifest as generally throughout his commentarie vppon the Epistle to the Romanes, so notably in 1. Cor. Cap. 1. vpon these wordes of the Apostle, I thank my God al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies for you, for the grace of God which hath bene giuen you in Christ Iesu. <q>
                        <hi>Datam dicit, &amp;c.</hi> He saith this grace which hath bene giuen you in Christ Iesus, which grace is so giuen in Christ Iesus, because this is decre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of God that he which beleueth in Christ, should be saued, without workes, obtaining freely remission of sinnes, by faith only.</q> Also <hi>in Praef. ad Gall. a praedicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>one, &amp;c.</hi> that from the preaching of Iohn, the lawe doth cease, that only faith may suffice vnto saluation, which is an abridgment of the law.

For as the falling out of the lott, is not in our power, but is such, as chaunce hath brought, so the grace of our Lorde, is not as it were of the merite of hire, but is deliuered, as of his will.</q> This writeth Ambrose of al that are partakers of the grace of God, and not of them that are newly baptised or conuerted only. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:13044:110"/>
in the same Booke, he saith, speaking of all men that attaine to saluation, <q>

But when we come to expounding of these places, we shall finde, eyther reason or auctority of these Doctors for vs. In the meane time, we will consider Hieronyme, whom Bristowe saith, that I confesse to haue allowed prayers for the deade: Wherein he saith vntruly, for I neuer confessed simply, that he allowed prayers for the deade: But Pur. 194. I saide interroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuely and by waie of concession, Howe hapeneth it y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Chrysostome and Hieronyme, which both interpreted that place, could gather no such matter, although they otherwise allowed prayer for the deade?

vpon Gal. 6. although he in exposition allude to 2. Cor. 5. we must all appeare before the iudgment seate of Christe.

named. Bristowe replyeth, that I confessed Cap. 3. that the olde doctours heard both the name and the thing, &amp;c. Thus he chargeth me still with confessions falsely. For although Augustine heard of the name of Purgato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, whereof he sometimes doubteth, sometimes denyeth all places but two, yet no writer before him. Neither were prayers for the dead heard in the Churche, before the heresie of Montanus. But to returne to Hierome, whom I saide in Eccle. 11. to expound the North and South, not for the states of grace and wrath, but for the places of rewarde or punishment: Bristowe sayeth of both. But I denie that he speaketh of the state of grace, in that sort that Allen meaneth: namely, that any man so dieth in the state of grace, that he obteineth release of punishment after this life, which is the matter in question, but that Bristowe is disposed to cauill. For although a man in this life, may be remoued out of the North into the South, yet when the tree is fallen, there is no more remouing by Hieroms iudgement. <q>Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer thou preparest thee a place, and a seate hereafter, whether it be in the South, or in the North, there when thou art dead, thou shalt continue.</q> This whiche the Doctor speaketh expressely of a place, a seate of euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting continuance, Bristow for want of a better answere, expoundeth of merite, as though it might stande with Hieronyms authoritie, that the place might be chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged although the merite can not be bettered.</p>

Bristowe cauilling, that he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth not, but speaketh doubtfully, &amp;c. saith that he onely sheweth it ought not to be expounded, after the heresie of the Origenistes of hell fire. But Augustines wordes are plaine: <q>
                        <hi>Ignis enim de quolocutus est eo loco Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                           <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>tolus, talis debet intelligi, vt ambo per eum transeant, &amp;c.</hi> For the fire whereof the Apostle in that place speaketh, ought to be vnderstoode such, that both may passe tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough it, that is, both he that buildeth vpon this founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Golde, Siluer, pretious stones, and he also which buildeth Woode, Strawe, Stubble. For when he had saide this, he added: The fire shal trie euerie mans work, such as it is, if any mans worke remaine, that which he hath builded vpon, he shall receiue rewarde: But if any mans worke be burned, he shall suffer losse, but he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe shalbe saued, yet so as it were through fire. The fire truely, is the tentation of tribulation, of which it is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestly written in an other place, The fornace pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth the potters vessels, and tentation of tribulation, iust men. This fire in this present life, worketh that which the Apostle saith, &amp;c.</q> By this you see that fire in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted of tribulation in this life, &amp; denied to be spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of Purgatorie fire, thorough whiche by their owne consent all men do not passe. Againe he speaketh not at all, against the Origenistes opinion of hell fire, that it shall haue an end, but against such as in his time did holde, That they which forsake not the name of Christ, and are baptised with his lauer in the Church, and are not cut off from it by any schisme or heresie, although they liue in neuer so great wickednes, which they nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wash away by repenting, nor redeemed with almes, but continue most stubburnely in them vnto the end of this life, shalbe saued through fire, although they be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished according to the greatenesse of their sinnes and
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:13044:113"/>
wickednesse with long, but yet not eternal fire. <q>But they which beleeue this, &amp; yet are catholikes, seeme to me to be deceiued by a certeine humane beneuolence. For the holy scripture being consulted, answereth another thing &amp;c.<bibl> 
                           <hi>Enc. ad Laurentium. C.</hi> 67.</bibl>
                     </q> Thus his reasons are against a temporal purging fire, through which some should passe &amp; not all, therfore against the popishe purgatorie, although he denye not but such a thing may be, yet it cannot be proued by this place, nor by any other place of scripture, as hereafter we shall see more at large in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 3. diuision of this chapter, where Bristowe promiseth I wot not what, to shewe of Augustines iudgement for Purgatorie. I answered Allen, apposing vs, where we had that new meaning of our sauiours wordes, that he which is cast into prison for neglecting of reconciliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on while he is in the way, is cast into hell, from whence he shal neuer come, I alledged for that sense Chryso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome, Augustine, Hierom, &amp; Chromatius. This is pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing childish (saith Bristow:) For D. Allen demaundeth no such thing. But this in deede is passing impudence: for Allens words in the same diuision (after he hath po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Caluin, Flaccus, Luther, Iewel, about their interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of scriptures, are these: <hi>But I will not make a recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of their vnseemely gloses, I would their followers would on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly but aske them in all matters, from whence they had such newe meanings which they falsely father on Gods word.</hi> Nowe the whole discourse of that Chapter as appeareth by the ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, is of that place, Math. 5. Pur. 132. Yet saith Bristow, it is not true, that all those doctors haue that sense, which I affirme them to haue. But he only saith it, let their wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des be read, Pur. 145. Where Allen alloweth all inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretations of the place, 1. Cor. 3. so long as they affirme no error: I sayde he may by the same reason allowe contradictories to be true. As in that saying, Matth. 5. of him that shall not come out, vntill he haue payde the vttermost farthing, some haue expounded, that he shall alwayes be punished: some, that hee shall not be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes punished. Howe is it possible that both these in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretations can be true? <hi>Mary</hi> (sayth Bristow, with
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:13044:113"/>
as fine Rhetorike, as strong Logike:) <hi>Thus it is true, those he and he, are not one he: but he that shalbe alwayes punished, is he, that to the end of the way, that is this life, agreeth not with his aduersarie, whome he hath deadly iniuryed, as saying to him, fatue, and thereby incurring the guylt of Gehennae ignis, which i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> the prison of the damned. He that shal not be alwayes punished, is he whose iniury was but veniall, as Racha. And so both inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretations agree well, not onely together, but also with the text it selfe.</hi> In deede, this is a fine distinction of he and he: but that hee which agreeth not with his aduersarie in the way, shalbe cast into prison, from whence he shall neuer come, whatsoeuer the matter were betwixt them, there is but one prison, from whence there is no deliuerance, vntil the last farthing be payde, which by those doctors exposition, is neuer payde. Whether the iniurie be grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or lesser, the punishment is eternall, without recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation, or as Saint Luke sayeth, diligence to be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled. If thou being readie to offer thy gifte at the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, doest remember that thy brother hath any thing against thee, goe and reconcile thy selfe, sayeth Christe, and agree quickly with him while thou art in the waye. Marke that hee speaketh of all iniurie euen offered by anger, or saying <hi>Racha,</hi> and not onely of saying <hi>Fatue.</hi> But as for, that he, which agreeth with his aduersary while he is in the way, what trespasse soeuer hee hath done him, he is not at all committed to prison, were his iniurie great or small. So that which He soeuer com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth into prison, there is no waye of escape, vntill hee haue payde the vttermost farthing, which debt is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes in paying and neuer discharged.</p>
                  <p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>First, about the booke of Machabees.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Where I sayde, that Allen pretendeth to proue the <note place="margin">Fulke.</note> booke of Machabees by authoritie of the church, when hee cannot by consent that it hath with the scriptures of GOD: Bristowe replyeth, as though
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:13044:114"/>
all bookes are canonicall which haue consent with the Scriptures. Fulk reioyneth, that hee vnderstandeth not his argument so, but that which hath not consent with other canonicall bookes, is not canonicall.</p>
                  <p>Where I take exception, to the Councel of Carthage, which numbreth this booke among the canonical scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, as a Councell prouinciall: Bristowe sayth, it was by my confession confirmed in the sixt generall Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of Constantinople in Trullo, therfore it hath y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie of the whole true church. But I tooke no excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the generalitie therof. But let it be as generall as you will, both that and the Councel in Trullo erred by your owne iudgement, seeing Carth. 3. Ca. 26. decreed against the authoritie of the Romane prelate, euen by name, as Gratian witnesseth, Dist. 99. That in Trullo condemned Pope Honorius for a Monothelite heretike Art. 16. &amp; 17. Beside this, I alledge, that this Councel of Carthage 3. among Canonicall Scriptures, nameth fiue bookes of Salomon, whereas the church alloweth but three. Bristowe answereth out of Augustine (which hee saith was one of the Councell) that the booke of wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and Ecclesiasticus, of a certeine similitude, were called Salomons bookes, whereas they were written by Iesus the sonn of Syrach, although the former he retract in rest. li. 2. Ca. 4. I aske no better to proue the errour of the Councell, but that they named fiue of Salomon for three. Secondly, it appeareth by Augustine which was one of the Councell, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> although they called these books canonical, yet they meant them not to be of equall au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie with the rest of the scriptures, <q>
                        <bibl>
                           <hi>Aug. co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tra Gaudent. lib. 2. Ca.</hi> 23.</bibl> And this scripture of the Machabees, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Iewes count not as the Lawe &amp; the Prophets &amp; the Psalmes, to whome our Lord giueth testimonie as to his witnesses, saying, it behoueth that all things should be fulfilled y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> are writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of me in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> law &amp; in y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Prophets &amp; in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Psalms. But it is receiued of the church not vnprofitably, if it be soberly read &amp; heard.</q> Bristowe saith I ascribe vnto S. Augustine. y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which he reporteth of the Iewes, when I say that he alloweth them not in full authoritie w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the law,
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:13044:114"/>
the Prophets &amp; the Psalmes: fraudulently omitting, that which I cited out of Augustine in the continued sente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce that our Sauiour Christ appealeth to these onely wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses, namely the law, the Prophets &amp; the Psalmes, &amp; so the Iewes by ancient tradition, diuide all the canonical bookes into these three orders. Secondly, where I note y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Augustine alloweth not these bookes w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out condition of sobrietie in the reader or hearer: Brist. saith, that all Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholikes &amp; S. Peter do require y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same condition in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the whole scriptures, as S. Augustine doth in the Donatistes, which defended the murthering of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues by example of Rasis out of the Machabees. Wherunto I reply, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> although sobrietie be required in al readers of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> holy scripture, &amp; other writings also: yet it is not requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, as a condition making y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> scriptures to be profitably receiued of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> church, if they be soberly read: for how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> canonicall scriptures be read, &amp; by whomsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, although he be mad &amp; drunk y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> readeth or heareth them, yet are they not only profitably, but also necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily receiued of the church, but this scripture of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chabes (saith Augustin) it is receiued not vnprofitably, if it be soberly read or heard. Who seeth not a gret diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between this scripture receiued vnder condition, &amp; the canonical scripture authorized by Christ him selfe? But Augustine (saith Brist.) &amp; the Councel, call these ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonical, <hi>de doct. Chr. li. 2. Ca.</hi> 8. In that place Augustine na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth al that by any church are counted canonical, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing in a maner as Bristow granteth, that they were not all generally receiued of the whole church, &amp; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore instructeth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> stude<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of diuinitie to prefer some be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore others. The reasons that I brought to proue this booke, not to be canonical, are these, first because y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mendeth Rasis for killing himself, which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to Gods commaundment. Bristow answereth out of Augustine, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the scripture hath only told it, &amp; not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended it. But the place is manifest, 2. Mach. 14. that the author of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> booke doth not only report his murthering of him self, but also doth highly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mend his manfulnes therin, willing (saith he) rather to dye valiantly, than to
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:13044:115"/>
giue him selfe into the hands of wicked men, &amp; to suffer reproch vnworthie for his noble stock, &amp; so forth to the ende of the Chapter. Secondly, I said, that writer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridgeth the fiue bookes of Iason: but the holy ghost maketh no abridgement of other mens writings. Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowe sayth, the booke of Kings in many places abrid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth stories, telling where they be written in other bookes that are not canonicall. To this I answere: the holy ghost abridgeth not the stories written by the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite of man, but for ciuile affaires, sendeth the reader to other writers, seeing they are out of his purpose to writ of them. Furthermore he sayeth, S. Marke is commonly called the Abridger of S. Matthewe, I aunswere, not so co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly, as falsly, for many things he rehearseth more largely then S. Mathewe, and something he vtterly o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitteth, which is not the office of a true abridger. And albeit y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he did, it were no answere to mine obiection, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> because the spirite of God telleth shortly, that which he himself had told at large, as in the Actes, the sermons of the Apostles, he is an abridger of Chronicles written by prophane men. The citing of the saying of Poets, Act. 17. &amp; Tit. 1. proueth not that the holy ghost intending to write an historie of the church, vseth the labour of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> prophane man Iason the Cyrenian. I trow it is one thing to cite a verse or a piece of a verse to confute men by their owne receiued witnesses, another thing to bring fiue bookes of an historie into one. Thirdly I sayd, the author of that booke confesseth, that he toke that mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in hand, that men might haue pleasure in it, which could not away with the long tedious stories of Iason. But the spirit of God serueth not such vaine delightes of men. Brist. asketh, if profitable breuitie be a vaine de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light? but I speake not of the breuitie, but the cause why he affected breuitie, namely, that men might haue plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure in his worke. Fourthly, I said, the author sheweth what labor &amp; sweat it was to him to make this abridge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ambitiously co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mendeth his trauell, &amp; sheweth the difference between a storie at large, &amp; an abridgement, all which things sauour nothing of Gods spirit. Also he
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:13044:115"/>
confesseth his infirmitie, and desireth pardon if he haue spoken slenderly and barely, whereby hee testifieth suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he was no scribe of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> holy ghost. Bristow saith (that he ambitiously commendeth his trauel) is but my blasphemy, all y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> rest standeth well ynough with the assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> holy ghost. Concerning his ambitious co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of his trauel, where to serueth his great co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plaint of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> great labour, sweat, &amp; watching y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> it cost him? &amp; the wise similitude y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he taketh of him that maketh a feast, &amp; seeketh other mens commoditie, &amp; hath no smal sauor: <q>so we also for many mens sake (saith he) are very well content to vndertake this great labour. A great labour I promise you, and to great profite of many.</q> Likewise in the ende, a passing good similitude of wine, to fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishe his booke which hee beganne with a feast. <q>As it is hurtfull to drinke wine alone, and then againe wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and as wine tempered with water is pleasant, and delighteth the taste: so the setting out of the matter deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the eares of them that reade the storie.</q> But to the rest, Bristowe asketh, if the scribes of the holy ghost, must bee alwayes eloquent, or able to doe all without sweat or labour? I aunswere, as vaine eloquence is not profitable for them, so they neuer complain for the lack of it, but spirituall vtterance they haue abundantly, and that without sweat and watching, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they write as the spirite of God doth moue them. Neither doth S. Paul confesse, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he lacketh vtterance, when he said he was rude in speaking: 2. Cor. 11. but rehersed what the false Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles did obiect against him, for otherwise his speech was so eloquent in diuine eloquence, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he was of the pagans at Lystra taken for Mercurie. Act. 14. Neither doth hee excuse his boldnes writing to the Romans, as Bristowe saith blasphemously, but sheweth that he was bold, vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his office, because he was y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> minister of Christ vnto the gentils. Ro. 15 That he vsed y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hand of Tertius in writing y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Epistle, or any other, it was not to auoid y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> labor of endi ting: Finally, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he vsed intollerable paines in preaching, It proueth not, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it cost him great labor, &amp; trauel in stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dying, what to write or preach either, which y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> spirit of
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:13044:116"/>
God did minister vnto him plentifully: But neuer doth he craue pardon, as one vncerteine whether he haue don well or no, as the writer of the Machabees doth, confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing in the end that he hath done as wel as he could, and in the beginning, leauing to the author y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> exact dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of euery particular, so submitting his labour as infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior in perfection to the worke of Iason the Cyrenian. That I speake not of so many falshods and fables as hee affirmeth for truth, which are refelled both by the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer book of Machabees and by Iosephus.</p>
                  <p>Where Allen alleged y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> authority of Ierom in Prol. Mac. I said I knew not what place he noted therby, for in S. Ieroms works none such is found: now commeth Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow, &amp; telleth me it is in a preface before the booke of Machabees, in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vulgar latine Bybles, taken out of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> se<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>se of Ierom, as diuers of those prefaces be, and that wil ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare by these two places, which I cite out o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> him to proue y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> booke not canonicall: The former is in his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face vpon y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> book of kings, where rehersing y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> names of the canonical books, he omitteth this, and after saith ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly it is not in the Canon. Bristow aunswereth, it is not in the Canon of the Hebrewes. As though the church of God, since Christ shoulde haue more bookes of the olde testament in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> canon, then y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> church of the Hebrews had.

                  <p>The other place of Ierom is in his preface vppon the prouerbs, that they were neither in the Churches canon. <q>Therefore euen as the church readeth in deede y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bookes of Iudeth, Tobias &amp; Machabees, but yet receiueth them not among the canonicall scriptures: so also these two books Ecclesiasticus and Sapientia, she may reade to the edifying of the people, but not to confirme the authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:13044:116"/>
of the churches doctrin:</q> To wit (saith Bristow) against the Iewes, as though y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Churches doctrin, is not to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

                  <p>That Augustine accounteth these bookes canonicall, after a sort, it was of me confessed, and therefore needed none other testimonies as Bristow bringeth, <hi>de praed. sanct. &amp; de ciuit. Dei lib. 18. cap.</hi> 36.</p>
                  <p>But Ierom is also cited in his preface vpon y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> booke of Iudith to affirme the booke of Iudith to be canonicall by the councell of Nice: if that were so, what pertaineth it to the book of Machabees? But in deede it is not so: for though we shoulde doubt nothing of the credit of that preface in Iudith, the words are these: <q>With y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Hebrewes the booke of Iudith is redde among y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hagiographaor books called holy writings, whose authoritie to streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then those things y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> come in controuersie, is iudged lesse conuenient: yet being written in the Chaldee tongue, it is counted among the stories. But because the Synod of Nice is redde to haue accounted it in the number of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly scriptures, I haue yelded to your request, &amp;c.</q>
                  </p>

<pb n="223" facs="tcp:13044:117"/>
that we count it not all catholike whatsoeuer shall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare contrary to the rules appointed.</p>
                  <p>By this Bristow seeth, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I am a great reader of the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors. For whosoeuer made this homily (saith he) he took those words out of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> instructions which followeth the Epistle of Pope Celestinus, in the first tome of councels, where the wordes are not, the writings of the Apostles but the writings of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> see apostolike, which are thought sufficient. Whatsoeuer my reading be, for the maker of the Homily, I cannot depose, but I trust he will not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, but it hath in al printed books gone vnder the name of Chrysostom, and it containeth nothing vnworthy the iudgement of Chrysostom. It is therefore more like that Celestinus or whosoeuer gathered that instruction, bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed those words out of this homily, and from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of the Apostles peruerted them to the writings of the see apostolike, many such borrowing &amp; peruersions are commonly found in those pontifical Epistles. For ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit that not Chrysostom, but some later man made that Homily which borrowed such words out of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Epistle or instruction: Why did he alter them, if hee thought the writings of the apostolike see sufficient, to approue all catholike doctrine? except perhaps his copie had also <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postolica scripta,</hi> &amp; that copie which Peter Crab follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in gathering the councels is corrupted. Certaine it is, the homily is auncient, and made in the time when the Pelagian heresie begun to spring, which was in the later time of Chrysostom, &amp; therfore I haue vsed no fraude, or misdemeanour in citing this saying for Chrysostoms, wherto Bristow maketh no answere, but denyeth the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority. Likewise wher I cite out of Chrysost. in <hi>Ge. Ho.</hi> 58. Thou seest into how great absurdity they fall which will not follow y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Canon or rule of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> holy scripture, but permit al to their owne cogitations. Bristow answereth nothing, but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Chrysost. answereth heretikes which said our Lord took not ture flesh: as though his se<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce is not general against al heretiks which go besid the scripture. Thirdly I saide, if we be further vrged, we wil allege y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he writeth in <hi>Euang. Iac. Hom.</hi> 58. He that vseth not the holy scripture, but clymeth another way that is a by way not allowed is a theese.</p>

                     <pb n="224" facs="tcp:13044:118"/>
To this Bristow replyeth, that I will call Chrysostom a theefe by his owne saying, for vsing tradition, yea ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rely if he be obstinate: and why not as well as S. Paul, or an Angel accursed, if they bring an other Gospel? Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly he saith, as though he vseth not scripture, which vseth tradition, or that scripture doth not warrant tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition as 2. Thessa. 2. I aunswere such tradition as is war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted by scripture we refuse not, but if al your traditions were warra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted by scripture, wher should be your vnwrit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten verities? Thirdly (saith Bristow) the thing y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth of, is that Antichrist &amp; Pseudochrists, cannot shewe any commission out of scripture. I answere that proueth the Pope to be Antichrist, who neither for his authoritie, nor for his doctrine, can shewe any commission out of the scripture.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly I saide, we may bee as bolde with Chryso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome, as he saide he would be with Paul himselfe, in 2. <q>

No verily, but by reuelation he spake to S. Paul, by aud<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ble and humaine voyce hee spake to the rest of the Apostles, and whatsoeuer hee spake any way pertaining to our instruction, is committed to writing, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I beleeue not Chrysostom, alledging a tradition of the Apostles which is not founde in their writings.</p>
                  <p>Another place of Chrysostom, I cite in Luke, Chap. 16 saying that ignorance of the scriptures hath bredde here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies: Therefore hee woulde haue heresies kept away by knowledge of the scriptures. We would the same (saith Bristowe) but what maketh this for onely scripture to be of authoritie? yes forsooth. If all heresies come through ignorance of the scriptures, that which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth not through ignorance of the scriptures, is no he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resie: And that opinion which is not contained in the scriptures, commeth not of ignorance of the scriptures: therefore he y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> knoweth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> scriptures, knoweth all truth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="225" facs="tcp:13044:118"/>
Vnto Leo the great alledging custome and tradition, I oppose his owne saying, for onely Scripture to be suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient. <q>Ep. 10. They fall into this follie, which, when they be hindred by some obscuritie, to know the truth, haue not recourse to the wordes of the Prophets, nor to the writinges of the Apostles,</q> nor to the authorities of the Gospell, but to themselues.</p>
                  <p>He doth not say (saith Bristowe) that all truethes are expressed in the Scripture. For he blameth the here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tike, for not hauing recourse to our common Creede, as though there were any thing in our common Creede, which is not expressed in the Scripture. And if onely Scripture were not sufficient for men to know the truth in any obscuritie, howe could they be blamed for not hauing recourse vnto them, for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which they cannot find in them? The words of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> councel of Constantinople y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 6. Act. 18. of Bristows true translation are these: <q>If all men had simply, and without calliditie from the beginning receiued the Gospels preaching, and bene content with the Apostles institutions, the matters verily had beene well a fine, and neither the authors of heresies, nor the fautors of the Priestes, had bene put to the paynes of conflictes: but because the diuell not resting, ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth vp his squires, therefore Christe also in time con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient hath raised vp his warriours against them, to wit, the general councels, which to this time haue bene holden being sixe in number.</q> So expressely (saith Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowe) they auouch the authoritie of councels, and you alledge them for only Scriptures. I crie you mercie sir: Doe they alledge the authoritie of Councels, as though the preaching of the Gospell, and the institutions of the Apostles in their writings were not sufficient: when they saide before, if men would haue bene content with them, there needed no councels? But you adde, that in their wordes, there is no mention at all of Scripture, but onely of preaching and teaching. What I pray you, is the Gospel, which they should preach no scripture? are not the constitutions of the Apostles conteined in their writinges? I know you will answer they are not all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:13044:119"/>
in their writinges. At leastwise what sworde did these warriers vse against Satan, styrring vpp his squires? doth not the councell say expresly the sworde of the spirit, which is the worde of God contained in the Scriptures? for what other worde doth Saint Paule com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend to the Eph. 6. but the holy Scripture which is profitable to reproue all heresies into perfection? 2. Tim. 3.</p>
                  <p>Against Basil maintaining vnwritten tradition I op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed his owne auctority, <hi>De Ver. Fid. in Proem. Morall.</hi> We knowe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we must now and alwaies auoyde euery worde and opinion that is differing from the doctrine of our Lorde. But all is not differing, saith Bristowe, that is not expressed in the Scripture. Neither doe I say so, but all is differing that can not be proued by Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. And so saith Basil in his short definition, to the first interrogation. <q>Whether it be lawfull or profitable for a man, to doe or saie any thing which he thinketh to be good, without testimony of the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: He answereth: For as much as our sauiour Christ saith, that the holy Ghost shall not speake of himselfe, what madnes is it that any man should beleeue any thing without the auctority of Gods worde?</q> Here you see, he extendeth the worde of God no farther then the holy Scriptures. Yet Bristowe saith: If I sawe the place, my malice passeth. For the wordes are these. <hi>Who can be so madde, that he dare so much as to thinke any thing of him selfe?</hi> And it followeth. <hi>But because of those things &amp; words that are in vse amongest vs, some are plainly taught in the holy Scripture some are omitted.</hi> Concerning them that are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted (saith Bristowe) <hi>We haue this rule, to be subiect to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men for Gods commandement renouncing quite our owne wills.</hi> In very deede I abridged the place, and gaue the true sense, because it is large. But if Bristowe vnderstand Basills language, his wordes are these: <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, &amp;c, <q>Seeing our Lorde Iesus Christ saith of the holy Ghost, for he shall not speake of himselfe, but what things so euer he shall heare, the same shall he speake: and of him
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:13044:119"/>
selfe: the sonne can doe nothing of himselfe. And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, I haue not spoken of my selfe, but the father which hath sent me, he himselfe hath giuen me a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement what I shall saie and speake. And I knowe that his commandement is life eternall. Therefore the things which I speake, euen as the father hath said vnto me, so I speake. Who is come into so greate madnes, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he dare of him selfe take vpon him any thing <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> euen vnto knowledge? which hath neede of the holy and good spirite as a guide that he may de directed into the waie of truth, both in minde and speache, and deede, but walketh blinde and in darknes without the sonne of righteousnes, yea our Lorde Iesus Christ, him which giueth light with his commandements as it were with beames? For the commandement of the Lorde saith he is bright, lightning the eies. Seeing then that of such things as we haue in vse, some are vnder the com mandement of God prescribed in the holy Scripture, &amp; some are not spoken of concerning those that are writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, no liberty at all is giuen to any man, neither to do any thing of those that are forbidden, nor to omit ought of those things which are prescribed. Seeing the Lorde hath once charged and saide: thou shalt keepe the worde which I command thee this daie: thou shalt not adde vnto it, neither shalt thou take from it. For there is a terrible expectation of iudgment and zeale of fyer, which shall deuoure all those which shalbe bolde to do any such thing. And concerning those things, which are not spoken of, the Apostle Paule hath set vs a rule say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: all things are lawfull for me, but all things are not expedient. All things are lawfull for me, but all things do not edify, Let no man seek his own profit but euery one an other mans. So that in euery matter, it is necessary to be subiect to God, according to his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement. For it is written, be ye subiect one to an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the feare of Christ.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>And our Lord saith, he that will among you be great, let him be least of all, and seruant of all, that is to say, estraunged from his owne will, according to the
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:13044:120"/>
imitation of our Lorde himselfe, which saith: I came downe from heauen, not that I should doe mine owne will, but the will of my father which hath sent me,</q> Where hath Bristowe, that we should be subiect to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men in such thinges, as are omitted by Scripture; therefore not my malice, but his ignorance passeth, and that willful also, although he follow the old barbarous translation of Basil when he may haue a better. An other place of Basil I cited in his <hi>Moral. defin.</hi> 26. <q>Euery word or deed must be confirmed by the testimony of holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture for the persuasion of good men, &amp; the confusion of wicked men.</q> Bristow saith, he admonisheth his monkes being students in diuinity, to be so perfect in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they may haue a text redy, at euery need as when we bidde them, cast all away that is not written, they haue this text ready, where Saint Paule biddeth vs the contrary. To holde the traditions which we haue lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, whether it be by his Scripture, or by his worde of mouth. 2. <hi>Thess.</hi> 2. And doth Paule bidde them holde such doctrine as was not to be proued out of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures? did hee preach any such doctrine among the Thessalonians, when those to whom he preached daily, searched the Scriptures, tosee if those thinges were euen so. Act. 17. And where I pray you, did you heare any tradition by worde of Saint Paules mouth, that you may obiect it to vs? we doubt not but whatsoeuer he preached was as true, as that he did put in writing, if you can assure vs of it: but seeing that is impossible, and it is certaine he preached no doctrine but such as he committed to writing, Basills rule must still stande in force, that euery worde and deede must haue confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of holy scripture, or else it is not good, for all good workes are taught in the Scripture, and all true doctrine may be found in them. 1. Tim. 3.</p>
                  <p>Now commeth Bristowe, to answere such things as I obiect out of Augustine against vnwritten traditions: which he digesteth into three sorts. The first are quota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of 11. or 12. places in which he preferreth the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tority of the canonicall Scripture, before all writinges
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:13044:120"/>
of Catholike Doctours of Bishops, of Councels, before all customes and traditions.</p>
                  <p>But this Bristow denieth to be the question, but whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther nothing but Scripture be of authoritie: I aunswere, those places proue that nothing is of infallible veritie, but the scriptures, therfore they proue that they only are of irrefragable authoritie.</p>
                  <p>The second sorte of places are about this question, who hath the true Church. Of which question I affirme, that S. Augustine would haue the Church sought only in the Scriptures. And he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e he biddeth me reade his first demande, likewise I wil send him to mine answer vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same. At length he confesseth, that Augustine is content in that question, to set aside all other authorities, to trie it by the Scriptures: <hi>But that nothing els is good authoritie in that question, that he neuer sayeth.</hi> Neither doe we say it, or refuse any authoritie, that is agreeable to the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. And as that one question, which was betweene S. Augustine, and the Donatistes was determinable by the onely authorititie of Scriptures, so are all questions that are betweene the Church of all times, and all heretikes.</p>
                  <p>The Donatistes helde that the Church was perished out of all partes of the world, except Affrica, as the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistes holde, that it is perished out of all partes except a peece of Europa. Saint Augustine by the Scripture proueth, the continuance in the Churche dispersed ouer all the worlde, and that we holde against the Romishe synagogue of Popish Donatistes, who haue separated them selues from the Catholike Church, into the fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of an Italian Priest, as the other did of an Affrican. But Bristowe sayeth, I am as blinde as a beetle, in say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the Papistes did separate themselues from our Church, seeing it is certain, that Luther did separate him selfe from the Popish Church. The like might be said to all them that forsoke the fellowship of any heretikes, to come vnto the Churche of God.</p>
                  <p>But Bristow is as madde as a marche Hare, that brag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging so much of the title of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> church, he is driuen to trie it only by the Scriptures, as Augustine calleth vpon the
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:13044:121"/>
Donatists. The other places which I aledge out of Aug, (saith Bristowe) are about al questions with heretikes, whatsoeuer. As that he would oppresse the Arrian Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ximinus with the authoritie of the Nicene councel. <hi>Lib. 3. Cap.</hi> 14. Bristowe asketh, whether he might not presse them with the authoritie thereof, as he doth the Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tistes? But aske Augustine him selfe who saith, he ought not in that case, that he charged the Donatistes, which it was by their own concession, because they allowed it. But he saith in the same place, the Fathers of the Nicene councell ratified Homousion, that is, equalitie of the sonne with the father, <hi>Veritatis autoritate, &amp; autoritatis veritate,</hi> by authoritie of trueth, and by trueth of au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie. This truth of authoritie, Bristowe will haue to be the authoritie of the Nicene councell, as though the councel could not erre: but then what needed y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie of trueth? In deede where the councel decreeth with the trueth, it is the trueth of authoritie, for other authoritie a Councell hath not, but of trueth: to declare trueth, and not to make trueth, for if it declare errour, as the councell of Arimine did, it hath no trueth of au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, because it hath no authoritie of trueth. Moreouer Bristow saith, I translate falsely these wordes, <hi>Nec ego huius autoritate, nec tuillius detineris.</hi> Neither am I bounden to the authoritie of the one, nor thou of the other. Whereas it should be: Neither doth the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie of the one hold me, nor of the other holde thee. There is greate difference betweene, beeing holden, and beeing bound. To the bare authoritie of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of Nice, Maximinus was no more bounden, then Augustine to the bare authoritie of Ariminum. It was the trueth of Nice, that the Arrian was bounde vnto, and the falshod of Ariminum, that Augustine was not holden with vs. But after the example of Augustine (saith Bristowe) we will not alledge the councell of Trent, as our proper witnesses to our side, but the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of Scriptures common to both. Witnesse hereof, Bristowes motiues, where he would ouerthrowe vs by the bare name of Catholike, and heretike, &amp;c. Againe
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:13044:121"/>
he saith, that we make challenge of 600. yeares also. And what then? Witnesses of trueth we take wheresoeuer they be, but authoritie of trueth onely out of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. Where I said, that Augustine, setting all other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suasions aside, prouoketh onely to the Scriptures, to trie the faith and doctrine of the Churche: Bristowe answereth: <hi>Howe true that is, appeareth in the same booke, De Vnitate Eccle. which you cite. For when he hath proued against the Donatistes, the Church to be his, he saith expressely, that to be inough also, for all other questions. Sufficit nobis:</hi> It is i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough for vs that we haue that Church, which is poin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted too, by most manifest testimonies of the holy and Canonicall Scriptures. <hi>De Vnit Eccle. Cap.</hi> 19. Doth he say expressely, it is inough for all other questions? I must needes say expressely you lie. For the onely question, being how the Donatistes should be receiued, if they would come to the Catholike Church, as though they were the true Church, because baptisme giuen among them was not repeated in the Catholike Church, Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine after much concertation saith. <q>
                        <hi>Quapropter cum di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catur haereticis, &amp;c.</hi> Wherfore seeing it is said to the here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiks: Rightousnes is wanting to you, which without cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, and the bonde of peace, no man can haue, &amp; seeing they the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues confesse, that many haue baptisme, which haue not righteousnesse, and if they would not confesse it, the holy Scripture conuinceth them, I maruell howe they thinke, when we wil not baptise them again, hauing not their own, but the baptisme of Christ, that we do so, as though we iudged nothing to be now wanting to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; that because baptisme is not giuen to them in the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike Church, which they are founde to haue already, they thinke they receiue nothing there, where they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> without which, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which they haue, auaileth them to their destruction, and not to their saluation. Which if they wil not vnderstand, it is sufficient for vs, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we holde y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Church, which is shewed forth by most manifest testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of the holy and canonical Scriptures.</q> Where he speaketh not of the authortie of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Church to determine questions, but sheweth it is sufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to haue proued by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
                     <pb n="232" facs="tcp:13044:122"/>
Scriptures, <q>that they are the true Church, although the Heretikes will not vnderstand how baptisme being mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistred out of the Church, hath not effect, but in the true Church,</q> for if it be manifest by the Scriptures that Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine holdeth the true Church, that last question of theirs, how they should be receiued, though it be not resolued, yet can not disprooue them to be the true Church, nor proue the Donatists to be the Church, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there can be but one.</p>
                  <p>Where out of this Booke Cap. 16. I shewe, that Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine declareth, first that Heretikes must be confuted only by Scriptures, secondly that neither councells, succession of Bishoppes vniuersality, miracles, visions, dreames nor reuelations, are the notes to trie the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike Church, but only the Scriptures: Bristowe saith, they are notes with the Scripture, as he hath shewed in his demaund, I answere whatsoeuer agreeth w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, may well be receiued. But the Scripture without all these is sufficient, to trie the Church as Augustine sheweth, &amp; therefore all the rest of Bristowes motiues, might be spared, if he durst ioyne issue vpon the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture only, as Augustine doth, but that he dare not do. He hath a great quarrell of Augustine, for translating <hi>mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festatur</hi> is proued, as though Augustine saide, that true miracles and visions lacke waight and fashion of iust probation. If you call true miracles, that are done in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede and not counterfeited, I say that all such make no iust probation. For God tempteth his Church by such, to see if they will forsake his commandement. Deut. 13. But those that be true miracles indeede, are ioyned with the truth of doctrine, which being tryed by the worde of God to be such, confirme it or prepare mens mindes vnto it, of themselues neuer sufficient to auouch true doctrine, without Gods worde: and therefore I will stil t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>Moreouer out of Augustine <hi>Cont. Epist. sundam. Cap.</hi> 4. I shewed, that though consent, and vniuersality, anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, succession, be good confirmation, when they are
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:13044:122"/>
ioyned with truth: yet when trueth is seuered from them, it is more to be regarded then they all. Bristowe saith, that Augustine graunteth not that the truth can be separated from them. Yes verily, or else he should haue stood vpon that poynt only, that truth can not be seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from those markes, which vndoubtedly the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Church had, and the Manichees wanted. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he saide, the Church had most syncere wisdom, yet he saith not, that wheresoeuer was antiquity, suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession, &amp;c. there must needs be the most syncere wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</p>
                  <p>Lastly out of the booke <hi>De Pastoribus Cap.</hi> 14. I affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, that mans auctority is too weake to carry away so waighty a matter, as was in question, vsing the wordes of Augustine: <hi>Auferantur chartae humanae, &amp;c.</hi> Let mens papers be remoued, let the voices of God be heard, shewe me one place of Scripture for Donatus side, &amp;c. Bristowe rehearsing the saying more at large as I did, Ar. 14. asketh what maketh all this for Fulke? vnlesse hee thinketh he hath any vantage in his owne false transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Acta,</hi> turning it decrees. Surely whether the worde be well or ill translated, I seeke no vantage ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and yet if I should change my translations, I would rather call <hi>Acta</hi> actes of the Court or recordes, then Courtrolles as you doe. But euery man may see, what vantage you clasp at, among ignorant persons, by your false translation of <hi>Chartae humanae</hi> mens Court papers, as though the worde of Augustine were not generall to remoue all mens writings, and to vrge only the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. But the Church beginning at Hierusalem &amp; sprea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ouer all Nations, to the very last time, which Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine in all places proueth against the Donatists, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth much against vs in Bristowes opinion. Nay ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther against the Papists, which restraine the Church into the Romishe rable, which we affirme, both is and was alwaies, scattered ouer al the world, although greater in number at some times then at other some, seeing that Mahomet hath infected a greate part of the worlde, and yet among the Mahometists we doubt not but Christ

But in deede they holde the contrary, for they helde the marriage of such law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, the Papistes dissolue them, and say they are no marriages. It is better saith Epiphanius, to haue one sinne, and not many. It is better for him that is fallen from his course, ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nly to take a wife according to the lawe, and of long time to repent from his virginitie, and so to be brought againe to the Church, as one that hath done amisse, as one that is fallen and broken &amp; hauing neede to be bounde, rather then to be wounded daily with priuie dartes, of that wickednesse, which the deuil putteth into him. So knoweth the Church to preache, these are the medicines of healing. Bristowe saith, I gather that marriage is an wholsome medicine for such men.

They say not marriage is a sinne, but by breache of vowe to marrie is a sinne. For their sinn cannot pollute the ordinance of God. But the wholsome medicines are penance &amp; reconciliation, saith Bristowe. And why not marriage I pray you? whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer is good for the diseased, is an wholsom medicine: to take a wife openly, is good for the diseased: therefore marriage also is a wholesome medicine.

                  </head>
                  <p>About the sacrament of penance, the Popish Church <note place="margin">Fulke.</note> saith foure thinges: first that by the Priestes absolution, the guilt of sinne and eternall paines due for it are taken away, but one houres torment in Purgatorie, as the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster of the sentences teacheth, is not taken away therby, and Allen confesseth (Bristowe saith) it auaileth to take away the torments of hell. But Allen Purg. 167. requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring submission to Gods ministers for absolution, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth them in most ample manner a commission of exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting Christes office in earth, both for pardoning and punishing of sinne: that suffering here in his Church sentence and iust iudgement for his offences, he may the rather escape our fathers greeuous chastisement in the life to come. Thus Allen is cleane contrarie to Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowe, and himselfe, and left naked in this place, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most in all places, by Bristowe, who would seeme to take vpon him his defence.</p>
                  <p>The second thing is temporall debt, remaining after absolution. Touching this matter, I said Purg. 42. That Augustine saith of the deathes of Moses and Aaron, that they were signes of things to come, not punishments of Gods displeasure. <hi>Quaest. in Num. lib. 4. cap.</hi> 53. Here Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowe complayneth of my synceritie, and rehearseth the wordes before. When it is said to them, that they should be gathered to their people: <q>It is manifest, that they be not in the wrath of God, which separateth from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> peace of the holy eternall societie. Thereby it is manifest, that also their deathes were signes of thinges to come, &amp; not punishments of Gods indignation.</q> What want of syn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceritie is here, except there be so great difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene indignation and displeasure? But Bristowe cauil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth of the wrath that separateth for euer, as though they were in a wrath that separateth for a time. <hi>Yet the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture presseth, where God saide you shall die, because you did not beleeue me.</hi> This was no satisfaction for their temporall debt remaining after absolution, wherof the question is,
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:13044:125"/>
but a fatherly correction to them, and an example vnto other. Yea such a correction as was a greater benefite, namely to be receiued into the eternall land of promise, then the punishment was, that they should not enter into the earthly possession.</p>
                  <p>Likewise I reported, that Augustine <hi>Cont. Faust. Lib. 22. Cap.</hi> 67. and <hi>De Pecc. mer. ac rem. Lib. 2. Cap.</hi> 23. saith that the punishment laide vpon Dauid after <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>his adultery re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, was the chastisment of Gods fatherly scourge. Bristowe asketh, if it be no punishment, because it is a scourge? yes verily: and whether it be not for sinne? yes truly. But neuer the sooner a temporall debt remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning after absolution, when it is the scourge of a fathers chastisement. For I chastice not my childe, that his pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment should satisfie any part of his fault, but to keepe him in humility, and feare for committing the like, and for example to the rest of my family, as wise a father and diuine as Bristowe will esteme me. And how can Bristowe defend Augustine against the Pelagians, shewing why death that came in by sinne, stil remaineth euen vpon them whose original sinnes he confesseth to be so fully forgiuen in baptisme, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they owe nothing, neither eternally nor temporally for them: if death in such, be any temporall debt, remaining after absolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, when he will haue the fatherly scourge of God to be a punishment to satisfie the debt of sinne.</p>
                  <p>But for a contradictorie of Allens assertion, I cited out of Chrysostome in Rom. Ho. 8. where there is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuenesse, there is no punishment. Bristow saith, he spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth of the forgiuenesse in baptisme to a Iewe: Allen of forgiuenesse in penance. But he may not creepe out at that hole, it is too straight for him. Chrysostome spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth generally, wheresoeuer there is forgiuenesse, there is no punishment, yea he saith, <hi>Vbi gratia ibi &amp; venia,</hi> where grace is, there is forgiuenesse therefore if there be grace in penance there is forgiuenesse, and where there is forgiuenesse, there shalbe no punishment: neither doth Chrysostome in that place speake a word, either of Iewe, or Baptisme, but of all Christians escaping by grace, the
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:13044:125"/>
wrath which the lawe worketh, and beeing made heires of the promise by faith.</p>
                  <p>The third thing is satisfaction, against which, Bristow saith, I alledged Chrysostome, and Ambrose so fondly, that the wordes which I alledge will declare, <hi>Chrysost. De</hi> 
                     <q>
                        <hi>
                           <bibl>Compunct. Cord. lib.</bibl> 1. Non requirit, &amp;c.</hi> God requireth not the burthen of shirts of haire, nor to be shutte vp in the streightes of a little cell, neither doth he commaunde vs to sitte in obscure and darke caues: This onely is that which is required of vs, that we alwayes remember our sinnes.</q> He requireth onely compunction of the heart, therefore he requireth no workes of satisfaction, neither those, nor any other. Bristow will see nothing, but the streight mourning of Monkes. The worde onely is so litle for his purpose, that he cannot see it. And when he hath praised this mourning as much as he can, Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostome saith it is besides Gods commandement.</p>
                  <p>To the place of Ambrose in <hi>Luc. 22. lib.</hi> 10. He saith of Peter. I read of his teares, I reade not of his satisfaction. Bristowe replyeth, that he saith immediatly before, I finde not what he said, I finde that he wept. Wherevpon he will gather, both confession, and satisfaction necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie. I would faine see that collection in a syllogisme.</p>
                  <p>Surely if they were both necessarie, S. Peter, by iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Ambrose, lacked two necessarie pointes of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, which Iudas had, and yet obteyned not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuenesse: But teares (saith he) are a speciall kinde of confession and satisfaction. And yet where Ambrose sayeth, they obteine pardon, Bristowe saith, they are not sufficient: so that Peter weeping, hauing beside his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward contrition a speciall kinde of confession and satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, had not y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which wold serue.

                  <p>The fourth thing is pardons, whereof Bristowe spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth as he doth commonly, with wonderfull confusion. I saide the olde satisfaction was in respect of the offence vnto the Church, and not to satisfie the iustice of God, which is not satisfied but by the death of Christ. The penance enioyned by the Church, vpon good considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, might be and often was released by the Church, as appeareth by many places of Cyprian, which Bristowe citeth and many other, but not by the Bishop only, and this release or remission, was called indulgence or par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, which is no more like to Popish pardons, then the creaking of a goose, is like the songe of a swanne. But as for pardoning of sinne, they affirmed that it was proper to God, as Ambrose to the virgine. <q>Sticke to penance euen to the end of thy life, and presume not that pardon may be giuen thee of mans day, for he deceiueth thee that so promiseth the. For thou y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hast in speciall sinned against the Lorde, it is meete that of him only thou looke for remedy in the day of iudgement.</q> Bristowe saith, <hi>He did binde her to penance all her life, bidding her not to hope for any pardon at his hand, as he bounde the Emperour Theodosius indefinitely, and loosed him after eight moneths pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, with a pardon. Who seeth not, quoth Bristow, that all this maketh plainly for pardons?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But Ambrose telleth her, not, that he would not pardon her, but that no man can pardon the offence committed against God, and that if the Pope himselfe should promise to pardon her, he should but deceiue her. And yet the Church might pardon the offence and slander where with they were iustly offended, by her whoredome, and restore her to the Communion, as I doubt not but they did; although she should continue her repentance, al the daies of her life, &amp; when Ambrose did binde and loose the Emperor, he did only vse the discipline of the Church, to bring him to repentance, that God might forgiue his sinnes, not that he might
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:13044:126"/>
make satisfaction for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> slaughter of 7000. men, of whom the greatest part were innocents by 8. moneths penance, but after such time, seeing him to be sorrowfull in deede, receiued him againe into the communion. The place of Cyprian <hi>In Sermon. de Lapsis</hi> is very cleare to shewe that God and not man, forgiueth the sinnes. <q>Let no man deceiue himselfe, let no man beguile himselfe, only our Lord can giue mercy, only he can graunt par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don to sinnes, as beeing committed against him, who hath borne our sinnes, who hath suffered sorrow for vs, whom God hath deliuered for our sinnes. Man cannot be greater then God, neither can the seruant by his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence remitt or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Our Lorde must be entreated, our Lorde must be pacified, with our satisfaction, which saith, he doth denie that man that denieth him.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Against this so plaine a place: Bristowe cauelleth, that he speaketh to impenitents, that trusted also in laie mens pardons: which is false, for they were not altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther impenitent, but not sufficiently repentant, neither did they trust in laie mens pardons, but without dewe repentance tried, made hast to be reconciled by en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaty of the Martyrs, yet with the hurtfull facility of the priests, whereof Cyprian complaineth:  <q>
                        <hi>Sic oportet Dei Sacerdotem:</hi> So it behoueth the priest of God not to deceiue with the deceiuable ye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>lding, but to prouide with wholesome remedies.</q> As for the pardons whose antiquity Bristowe would haue to be noted, were not pardons of sinnes, but release of time of separation en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioined by the Church to shewe repentance for their sinnes, as I declared before. Which is euen as auncient as the Gospell, whereas popish pardons <hi>Apoena &amp; culpa,</hi> are of a much newer stampe, and contrary to the aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent custome in the giuers, for they were geuen by the whole Church, in the persons, for they were giuen to men a liue only, in the time, for they were giuen but

of a short time of penance enioyned in this life, and not of so many thousand yeares, &amp;c. in the thing relea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, for they were neither pardons of punishment, nor of sinne dewe to Gods iustice, but of time of satisfaction to be made to the Church, when the Church was other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise satisfied.</p>

                  <p>Bristowe chargeth me to vse the arguments from <note place="margin">Fulke.</note> mens authoritie negatiuely, which I my selfe confesse to be naught, but he mistaketh the matter: I saide the order of prayers and administration of the holie myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, described by Iustinus, and Tertullian, doe suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently declare what was the vsage of the Christians in those purer times, in which no mention beeing made of oblations and sacrifice for the deade, it is certaine, there was none vsed, not onely because there is no mention, but because those two olde Fathers in their Apologies, declare whatsoeuer was done in their assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies. As for oblations for the dead, that Tertullian speaketh of, cannot be proued to haue beene vsed at the communion, but rather at the buriall of the dead. But Arnobius (saith Bristow) about the very same time, as a witnes to the contrarie, complayning that the connen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle houses of the Christians, were pulled downe by the Paganes, in which God is prayed vnto, peace, &amp; par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don is asked, for al men, for the Magistrates, for friends, for enemies, for the liuing and for the dead. Such a say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there is in Arnobius, <hi>Lib. 4. Con. gra.</hi> I confesse, but how proueth Bristowe, that he was about the time of Iustinus, or Tertullian, when he confesseth it was 300, yeares since Christians were named, <hi>Lib.</hi> 1? and vnder Dioclesian he florished, saieth Hierome, which was sixe or seuen score yeres after Tertullian, the later of the two who florished vnder Seuerus.</p>
                  <p>The olde liturgie of the Greeke Church in Epipha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius time, had a memorie of the dead, but seeing it was
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:13044:127"/>
an oblation for the Patriarches, Prophetes, Apostles, &amp;c. in the first institution thereof, it could be but an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering of thankes giuing, although Epiphanius expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded it after the errour of this time, to be a prayer for the sinner, &amp; a separation of Christ from the order of men. This is the effect of that I saide. Bristowe saith, I am de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, by thinking it is but one memorie, whereof Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanius speaketh, and sendeth me to the countefeit li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgies of Saint Iames, Chrysostome, and Basil, which were written long after their age, according as well to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> error of the time, in which they were writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as in some expressing the name of the Emperour, and Bishop, in whose time they were written. Also he sendeth me to diuers places of S. Augustine, but which I knowe not, for the place Encherid <hi>C. 110. &amp; Dulci. q.</hi> 4. are of one sacrifice offered for all baptized persons that are departed, which he saith for the very good are thankesgiuing, for them that were not very ill asking of mercie, for the verie ill no helpe, but a comfort of the liuing. Chrysostome al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so speaketh of a generall memorie of all that were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted, instituted by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Apostles <hi>Ad Philip. hom.</hi> 3. in which if there had bene an expresse forme of prayer for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> dead, he needed not of that memorie, to haue proued prayer to be profitable to the dead. The place of Origen he man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gleth, euen as his Maister Allen doth, but he more vsu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, suffering no sentence of any writer almost to be read together, without preiudice of his interlacing. <hi>In</hi>

But now doe we not celebrate the day of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuitie, seeing it is the entrance of sorowes &amp; te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ptations, but we celebrate y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> day of death, as y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> putting away of al sorowes, &amp; the escaping of al te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ptations. We celebrate y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> day of death, because they doe not die that seeme to die. Therfore also do we make memories of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Saints, &amp; deuoutly kepe the memories of our parents or friends, dying in the faith, as much reioycing in their rest, as desiring also for our selues a godly finishing in faith. So therfore we do not celebrate y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> day of natiuitie,
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:13044:128"/>
because they which die shall liue perpetually. And thus we celebrate it, calling together the deuoute men with the Priestes, the faithfull with the Cleargie, inuiting al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so the needie and poore, filling the fatherlesse and wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes with foode, that our festiuitie may be done in remembrance of the rest, which is vnto the soules de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted, whose memorie we celebrate, and may be made of vs a sauour of sweetenesse in the sight of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal God.</q> First concerning my translation, Bristowe will haue <hi>Religiosos</hi> to signifie Monkes, as though none were deuout, but they, or as though the Church in Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gens time, were so full of Monkes, as it was afterward. Secondly he saith, that death is a putting away of the so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes of this life only, where Origen saith of all, and it were small cause of reioysing, to put off the small sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes of this life, if men should enter the horrible tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Purgatorie. Againe, the rest of the dead, he will haue to be onely of their bodies. That were a poore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frigerium, if their soules should frie in Purgatorie. The sauour of sweetenesse he wil not haue to be a sacrifice of thankesgiuing, but a worke meritorious, as though it was a worke meritorious, that Noe offered cleane beastes after the floode, when the text saith, the Lorde smelled a sweete sauour, Gen. 8. and not rather a sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of thankesgiuing for his deliueraunce. The like ignorance (he saith) I shewe, to thinke that memorie for one, cannot be a prayer for him. As S. Paule to the Colloss. <hi>Remember my giues:</hi> and to the Hebrues, <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member them that are in giues, &amp;c.</hi> But where did I say so ignorantly, that prayer may not be ioyned with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance? For I trust Bristow is not so brutish, to say that all memorie is a prayer. But how skilfull is he, to compare the memorie of imprisonment, which is an admonition to pray for the imprisoned, with the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie of rest which beeing obteined, what should we pray for? As for the wordes in S. Iames his Masse, which was written by some Sir Iames, many hundreth yeares after Origens death, I cannot be persuaded that Origen should allude vnto them.</p>

Where Cyprian saith, that Victor deserued not to be named at the altar in the prayer of the priests, I shewed by diuerse good reasons, that he meaneth not of prayer for him, but such as was of thankesgiuing for the dead, and for the like godly departure of the faithfull liuing. For his offence in making a Clarke executor, was not to be punished with eternall torments, wherto Bristow an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swereth by telling of three things done in their Masse, which he saith were done in Cyprians time, but that is the matter in controuersie. my reasons alledged Pur. 284. he toucheth not at all.</p>
                  <p>I noted Pur. 259. that Allen had falsified 2. Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cells at once, the Councell of Carthage the 4, Cap. 95. &amp; the Councell of Vase, which speaking of such executors as defrauded the Church of the oblations of the deade, which they had bequeathed to the vse of the poore: Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len saith to excommunicate them, that hinder the obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for the deade. Now commeth Bristowe and saith, it is but meere cauelling to distinguish oblations of the deade, &amp; oblations for the deade, because Cyprian saith, there should be no offering for Victor. I haue shewed, Pur. 284. that this offering was but a thankesgiuing, and this discipline was not to cutt him from the Church, but an admonition to other. As for the other Councells of Toledo 11. Bracharense, with this of Carthage and Vase, I haue answered Pur. 426. against which, Bristowe here saith nothing, but repeateth them with his vsuall interlardings.</p>
                  <p>The Councell Bracharense, which I twise promised to shewe forth against Purgatory, when I came to it, Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow saith, I plainly confesse the contrary, to wit a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory for the deade. I said that for them that kill them selues, that Councell decreed, that no commemoration should be made. Ca. 34. &amp; what this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>memoration i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, I said it appeareth in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> next Canon, where they cal it the commemoration of the holy oblation, that is, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed, that no communion should be celebrated, in which being a commemoration of the sacrifice of Christ, no mention of them that so died should be in
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:13044:129"/>
their thankesgiuing, as was vsed for them that died well.</p>
                  <p>Out of the 3. Toletan. Cap 22. I shewed that it was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed that the bodies of the faithfull should be buried only with singing of psalmes, which must be thought sufficient for all Christians: this I said, excluded both prayers and oblations for the deade.</p>
                  <p>Bristow cauelleth, that although in carrying the corps to the grane, they vsed to singe psalmes, yet they might haue prayer &amp; oblation for their soules in the Church. I answere, the councell thinketh singingof psalmes suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient for the office of their buriall, therefore prayer and oblation were thought needelesse. But that they had prayer and oblation in Spaine, for the deade, he would proue by a saying of Augustine <hi>De cur. pro mor. Cap.</hi> 1. where he saith the custome of the vniuersall Church is, that in the prayers of the priest, which are made to God at the altar, the commendation also of the deade hath his place. This commendation might be without pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, as in the olde liturgie the oblation for all the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarkes, Prophets, Apostles &amp;c. or if it were in speciall forme of prayer for the deade in Affrica, it proueth not that it was in Spaine. For Augustine speaketh of the v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niuersall Church, no farther then his owne knowledge, or if it were in his time, it might afterward be reformed in Spaine, as diuers other errors were, namely in that Councell of Toledo, and other before it. But Bristowe vrgeth me farther, and saith, I might as well say, the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists pray not for the deade, because they carry the corps with psalmes. But he will neuer see the litle worde, only, ioyned in the Canon to psalmes, nor the sufficiency of the office for the buriall of all Christians. Againe he demandeth of <hi>De profundis,</hi> being a psalme, <hi>Is it not a pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er for the deade, trowe you?</hi> I trowe no. Except all pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers that men make for them selues, be prayers for the deade.</p>
                  <p>As for the buriall of papists, claimed by ministers in England, I thinke you belie them, for they could be
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:13044:129"/>
content you had all the obstinate papists in your bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some at Loueine, quicke and deade: But such as die a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong vs, we are not nice in denying them buriall in the vsuall cemiteries, although we communicate not with them in their life, yet alwaies protesting, that more seuere discipline were meete for them in their life, and to be executed vpon them euen in their death, after the example of Cyprians time although we think worse of them then Cyprian did of Victor.</p>
                  <p>I saide farther, that the place of Possidonius speaking of the funerall of Saint Augustine, proueth that the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice offred for the commending of his bodies deposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, was the sacrifice of thanksgiuing. Here first Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowe accuseth mine ignorance in antiquity, that I vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand deposition for the putting of his body by death, where it is the laying downe of it in the earth, as <hi>Leuatio corporis,</hi> is the taking vp of Saints bodies or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques, a worshipfull witnesse of antiquity. For Cyril<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus testifieth that they were not in his time taken out of the earth <hi>Lib. 10. Cont. Iulian.</hi> But marke how skillfully Bristowe expoundeth Possidonius, saying, <hi>The sacrifice was offred to God, for the commending of his bodies deposition.</hi> That is, saith Bristowe <hi>(expositione prima)</hi> for the laying downe of it in the earth by burying. Why might not his body be laide in the graue without a propiciatory sacrifice? The second exposition is, that by commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the deposition of his body, which is the laying it downe in the graue, he meaneth, the commendation of his soule to God.</p>
                  <p>With such expositions hee may prooue what hee will out of the Doctors. But to admitt this monstrous interpretation, how agreeth it with popery? or Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stines owne opinion, that seing he was a perfect man &amp; died in persecution, while his City was besieged, &amp; the same day it was taken, that any sacrifice, should be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred for his soule, seeing he himselfe saith, it is iniury to pray for a Martyr, <hi>De Verb. Ap.</hi> 517? But that prayers for the deade were vsed in Saint Augustines time, and at the celebration of the Lords Supper, it is not of me
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:13044:130"/>
denied, and therefore needed not of Bristowe to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued. But he will make me both answerer and replyer, Because I graunt that S. Augustine prayed for his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, and yet taunt Allen for translating <hi>Memoriam sui,</hi> a memorie of her to be a memorie for her, as though she would haue her sonne to be a Chantrie Priest, to sing for her.</p>
                  <p>First I say, that if the Pope himselfe, translate <hi>Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riam sui,</hi> a memorie for her, the translation is false. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, where he saith, the sacrifice of our price was offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for her: I shewed that before, that so he called the celebration of the Lordes Supper, vnderstanding it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthelesse not to bee the sacrifice it selfe, that bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing once offered, did perfectly redeeme vs, but a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie and thankesgiuing for the same, as I shewed out of Augustine and other Doctours, <hi>Pur.</hi> 316. and so forth in the rest vnto the leafe 327.</p>
                  <p>Finally, Bristowe citeth Augustine <hi>De Verb. Ap. Hom.</hi> 34. This as a tradition of our Fathers, the whole Church doth obserue, that for them which are departed in the communion of Christes bodie and bloud, when at the healthfull sacrifice they are remembred in their place, prayer is made, and it is rehearsed that it is offered for them also: I answere this oblation, being generall for all that are departed in the faith of Christ, can be but a sacrifice of thanksgiuing, considering that the sacrifice of bread and wine, as they called it, in remembrance of the onely and insacrificable sacrifice of Christ, as S. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine calleth his propitiatorie sacrifice, coulde be no propitiation, but a sacrifice of thankesgiuing, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speritie, or praise. <hi>August.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Bristowes answere is, that there are two Purgatorie fires, the one to punish soules for sinne, wherof S. Augustine is certaine: the other not to punish sinne, but onely to weare out by little &amp; little, such affections to worldely lawfull thinges, as to wiue, &amp;c. that without griefe of minde, he cannot parte from them, so as the other which builded Golde, &amp;c. whereof Augustine is vncertaine. Afterwarde he concludeth, they are two operations of one Purgatorie, the one to purge sinne with punishment, the other to purge worldly lawfull affections.</hi> If there be but one Purgatorie fire, Augustine doubteth not onely of the punishment, but of the purging fire. But Augustine speaketh not of purging lawfull affections, for what purgation should there neede, where no vnlawful thing is to be purged? But of vnlawfull affections of worldly lawfull thinges, which are loued so farre aboue mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, that they cannot be lost for Christes sake, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out greefe: these <hi>Cupiditates</hi> greedie desires, Augustine calleth the wood, Strawe, and stubble, which is builded vpon the foundation Christ, vpon whome it is sinne to builde any thing, but Golde, Siluer, or pearles, &amp;c. 1. Cor. 3. so that it is sinne that Augustine speaketh of. Whereof he doubteth, whether it is purged by a Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie fire after this life. Againe vtterly excluding im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitent sinners, from hope of this purging fire, it is manifest, that of penitent sinners he maketh this doubt, whether they may be saued by this Purgatory fire, after

Likewise wher he maketh a doubt whether such worldly lawful affections remain in the soules of the elect, departed, as loue of wife &amp;c. he shamefully slaundereth Saint Augustine, as though he helde any such opinion, when no such thing can be gathered out of his wordes falsifying to his purpose the Doctors wordes, which are <hi>Rerum secularium quamuis licitè concessarum tales cupiditates:</hi> Such greedy desires of world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, although things lawfully graunted, to call them such worldly lawfull affections, whereas Augustine saith not, that such affections are lawfull, but that the world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things are lawfull, on which such affection is sett. Likewise <hi>Ad Dulci. quaestion. prima.</hi> he bringeth for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, a certaine carnall affection towarde riches, a cogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of those things which are of this worlde, how a man should please his wife &amp;c to be this wood, haie, &amp;c. and likewise doubtfully concludeth whether therefore in this life only, men suffer these things, or whether cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine such iudgments followe after this life &amp;c. exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding againe murderers, fornicators, lyers periurers, &amp;c. The like doubt he maketh <hi>De Ciuit. Dei Lib 21.

                  <p>But Augustine (saith Bristowe) sheweth himselfe cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine of purging paines <hi>De Ciuitate Dei Lib. 21.

As for this place, being not founde in many auncient written coppies as Viues sheweth, seemeth to be a corrupted place added by other, not written by Augustine. The like may be suspected of the place Cap. 13. of the same Booke, where he reporteth what he had said before of remitting sinnes in the worlde to come, which yet is not to be founde in that Booke, as for the places of Enchirid. <hi>Cap.</hi> 110. and <hi>Ad

Touching inuocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Saints (which I confessed Augustine to allowe according to the error of his time) and prayers to be profitable for the deade, I said Pur. 317. that Augustine is full of doubts and questions in the matter, and first whether the mothers supplication to the Martyr profited her sonne, Augustine said, that did profite him buried in the holy place, if any thing profited. Whereof I gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that he speake<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Bristow crieth out that I am past all shame: for Augustiue neuer doubted whether such supplication might profitte, but whether the mother had any such cogitation. I aunswere, he doubted at least, whether such kinde of supplication did profite or no: for the doubt of her cogitation was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed before in an other condition, <hi>Si quidem credidit,</hi> if she beleeue, &amp;c. But to refell my impudencie, as it should seeme, he hath heaped vp a sorte of places, to proue that Saint Augustine clearely affirmed supplicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to Saints to profitte the deade: first, <hi>Non inaniter fiun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Where I cited out of Cyprian <hi>Cont. Demetr. Pur.</hi> 140. when men are depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from hence, there is no place of repentance, no ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of satisfaction, Here life is either lost or saued, Here prouision is made for euerlasting life, by the worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of the fruite of faith:</q> Bristowe chargeth me with clipping, because I left out the last periode, which is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to nor fro my purpose. Likewise where I said, he exhorteth Demetrianus himselfe to repentance, which had bene a wicked man and a persecutor of Christians, he chargeth me with changing, for I should haue said, which presently was. I changed no worde of Cyprian, in saying, he had beene, and a reasonable man would haue vnderstoode me, that he presently was such a one, when I said Cyprian exhorteth him to repentance. But what is the answere? This which is expresly written of Infidells in hell, and of baptisme, I pretend to be writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten of the faithfull in Purgatory, and of penance after baptisme. I answere, Cyprian speaketh generally of all
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:13044:133"/>
men, &amp; not of Infidels only, &amp; of al men in this world and not of Infidels in hell. <q>
                        <hi>Nec quisquam, &amp;c.</hi> Neither let any man be staide: either by sinnes or by yeares that he should not come to obteine saluation. To him that remaineth still in this worlde, no repentance is to late. The way is open vnto pardon: and to them that seeke and vnderstand the trueth, the accesse is easie.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Finally after he had saide, that passage is from death to life, the place by me cited, he addeth, <q>
                        <hi>Hanc graii<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am,</hi> This grace Christ bestoweth, this gift of his mercie he giueth by subduing death with the trophee of his crosse, redeeming the beleeuer with the price of his bloud, reconciling man to God his father, quickening a mortall man by heauenly regeneration. Him, if it may be, let vs all followe, let vs be esteemed by his sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament and signe, he openeth vnto vs the way of life, he restoreth vs to Paradise, he bringeth vs to the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome heauen: with him we shall alwayes liue, &amp;c.</q> These wordes declare that Cyprian acknowledgeth one meane of saluation, as well for the Gentile to be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tised, as for the penitent Christian by the onely mercie of God in Christe obteined in this life, without any satisfaction of paine, for euer after this life: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he saith moreouer, <q>That beeing made the sonnes of God by Christ, restored by his bloud, we shall alwayes reioyce with him. We Christians shall be together with Christ glorious, blessed of God our father, reioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of perpetuall pleasure, alwayes in the sight of God, and alwayes giuing thankes to God. For he can not be but alwayes ioyfull and glad, which when he was guilrie of death, is made sure of immortality.</q> Thus doth Cyprian promise to Demetrianus, if he did repent, but euen immediately before his death, and were bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, that he should enioye the same state of felicitie, with all faithfull Christians, in perpetuall ioy after death with Christ.</p>
                  <p>In like maner he exhorteth them that were fallen in persecution to repent in this worlde, while confession may be receiued, and satisfaction and remission made
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:13044:133"/>
by the Priest is acceptable to God, which he speaketh generally, as if he had saide, no satisfaction or remission made by the Priest, auaileth to them that are departed.</p>
                  <p>To the place of Chrysostome whiche I cited against himselfe: <hi>Pur.</hi> 251. Bristowe after he hath remoued the question from the cause to the person, answereth that no friend, no iust man shall helpe him, that dieth in mortal sinne, either committing euil or doing no good. I say no more but as I saide before, Let it be compared with Chrysostomes other saying, the Homilie next be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore 41. in 1. Cor. and with Allens exhortation in the same Chapter. Pur. 242. If thou yet chance, &amp;c. Out of Ambrose although allowing prayer for the dead, I ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in Psalm. 4. <hi>Bene, &amp;c.</hi> The Prophet did well to adde on earth, for if he be not cleansed here, he can not be cleansed there. I should haue saide, cleane (saith Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowe:) for though he be not cleane from veniall sinnes, he may be cleansed there, as also from the temporall debt of his remitted mortall sinnes. But he forgetteth the worde of the Psalme, out of which Ambrose ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth his note: <hi>Vt emundet cum in terra,</hi> that he may cleanse him on earth: why was it well added on earth, if he might be cleansed after this life? There is no cleansing but on earth.</p>
                  <p>Where Ambrose was alledged by Allen Pur. 104. to proue that euerie man immediately after his death, doth feele that he must looke for in the day of iudgement, I saide Purgatorie 105. I maruell wherefore it is brought in, if it bee not to ouerthrowe Purgatorie. For if it be true, no man feeleth paine after this life, but he that shall feele it eternally. This laste conclusion although Bristowe confesse, that Saint Ambrose him selfe sayeth it expressely in other places, yet he asketh howe I can inferre it of the wordes of Saint Ambrose <hi>In ep. ad Rom. Cap.</hi> 5. which I inferre not of his wordes, but of Allens wordes, citing the place of Ambrose, as though the wordes were these: <hi>And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Saint Ambrose saith: that without delay the good poore man
<pb facs="tcp:13044:134"/>
was carryed to rest, and the wicked rich out of hand suffered tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. THAT EVERY MAN (saith he) MAIE FEELE BEFORE THE DAIE OF IVDGE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MENT, WHAT HE MVST THEN LOOKE FOR.</hi> Bristowe leauing Allen, as he doth commonly, breechelesse, sheweth the wordes of Ambrose to be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise, as they are in deede. Which I will rehearse somewhat more at large then Bristowe hath done. <q>
                        <hi>Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ima pars mundi &amp;c.</hi> The greatest part of the worlde did not knowe, that God should be their iudge: and very fewe there were, ouer whom death did not raigne. But they ouer whom it raigned, after this death, which is called the first, were receiued of the second deathe vnto paine and destruction to come: but they ouer whome death raigned not, because they haue not sinned in the similitude of the transgression of Adam, were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued vnder hope vnto the comming of our Sauiour in a free place, as it is read of Abraham, that although he was in the lower partes, yet he was disseuered by a large distance, so that there was a greate goulphe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twene the iust and the sinners: how much more should there be to the godly and iust a c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>olinge, to the sinners parching heate, to the vngodly burning heate, that it might not be hidden before the iudgement, what euery one was worthy of.</q> This that Ambrose speaketh of the difference of the paines of the damned, before Christ, Bristowe by his accustomed interlacing would haue it seeme, as though he spake of Purgatory: for to sinners he addeth Catholiques, to the impious or vngodly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retikes. But he marketh not the conclusion, that such heate as they felte after their death, they should feele after the iudgement. Againe, <hi>Non latet</hi> he translateth might be partly knowne, as though that which is not hidde, is not manifestly and wholy knowne. That I ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out of Saint Ambrose <hi>De bono mortis:</hi> That death maketh no mans state worse, but such as it findeth in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie one, such it reserueth to the iudgement to come: Bristowe saith, that Purgatorie altereth not the state of the euill to worse, nor promoteth the state of the
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:13044:134"/>
good to better, but euery mans state is according to the merites of his life, nor hee that is cleansed in Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory hath his merites multiplied or amplified, but veniall sinnes and temporall debts taken away. In deede if the state of a thing were nothing, but that you will allowe it to be, it were somewhat that you say: but who will say, that he which is in torments in Purgatory, is in as good state as he that is in pleasure or ease of this life? or that he which is discharged of such debts, as you say must be paide in Purgatory, is not in better state, then he that now dieth and must be cast into the scal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding house, for such payment? But that you may vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand he speaketh not of the death of the wicked, which must abie for it, as Bristow saith: he addeth <hi>Ipsa quiete fouet,</hi> it cherisheth with rest: this cannot be of the wicked to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> there is no rest, but to the godly, which al imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly after death enioye rest, notwithstanding they be not all alike good, for of two sortes only Ambrose spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth, the wicked in torments after death, because of their wicked life, &amp; the godly in rest.

For of many of your errors, we name the auc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, and of praier for the dead, Montanus the heretike, vntill you can name vs a Catholique that helde it, which was more auncient then he, and although you would cleare your selues of theft, because you haue not stollen that article but receiued it, yet seeing it came first from a theefe, your possession can not be iust: and therefore ye must restore it to the heathen, from whence Montanus stoale it. Where I brought example of the heretikes, called Acephali, and diuerse other, Pur. 388. to proue that the first auctor of euery heresie can not be named; Bristow saith, that he findeth his name, to haue ben Seuerus, &amp; y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they were but a peece of Eutyches as the Puritanes are of Caluin But when writers dout, &amp; the common voice gaue them their name, because their bead was not knowen, the coni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

not serue the turne. If they had added nothing to Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyches, they should haue bene called Eutychians, as for the cauill of Caluine, and the Puritanes, deserueth none aunswere.

But Bristowe being driuen from the auctor, falleth to the beginning of an heresie, which being shewed to haue bene later then Christ and his Apostles, is indeede an vndoubted argument, to reproue an here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie. And the begining (saith he) is shewed by this, that the primitiue name of Christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s would not serue them, but they must haue new names to be called by.

<pb n="264" facs="tcp:13044:138"/>
was not decreed before the last Tridentine session. The second argument is this: your first auctors can be named after the beginning of the Churches rising w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> their newe opinions: <hi>Ergo</hi> their opnions were heresies, &amp;c. To this argument I answer, denying the antecedent, for we hold no new opinion, but y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> foundation of the Prophetes and Apostles, Iesus Christ, beeing the head corner stone. Where I take exceptions to Allens rule. Pur. 413: Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow expoundeth his meaning, to be of such an opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as is contrary to the truth, first preached by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles, and vpon his exposition not necessary vpon Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lens wordes, chargeth me with nugation or triseling, in adding mine exception, which is the same with his exposition. I pray the reader vouchsafe to peruse the place, and see if there be any droppe of shamefast bloud left in this blundering papist, which blusheth not to scoffe at me for triselings when he doth nothing but ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uil and trifle himself, and that without al wit, or reason, truth or likelihoode.</p>
               <p>In the 5. demand of contradiction of heresies in their first arising, where I had shewed, how some fewe plausi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble errors of praier for the dead &amp; to the dead Ar. 39 by litle and litle preuailed, without any great contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on mentioned in Histories. Bristowe saith, <hi>It is a fonde parte to tell why and how a thing was done, which was neuer done. For the Scripture Es. 62. and August. Ep. 119. Cap. 19. affirme that there ne should be, ne was any such silence in the true pastors, &amp;c.</hi> I answere both the Scripture and the Doctor speake of silence, which may bring present ouerthrowe of the Citie, or damnation of the Citizens. Otherwise the true pastors in Saint Augustines time, not only in silence passed, but by speache and writing allowed, the error of communicating of infants and the necessity thereof, as I haue shewed before. And seeing prayer for the deade and to the deade, by the holy Scriptures, are conuinced to be errors, it can be no iustifying of them to say, no man preached against them at their first rising. And seeing the Histories of the auncient time are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry fewe and short, it is more boldlie affirmed, then
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:13044:138"/>
soundly proued, that no man preached against them. Epiphanius doth not tell who preached against euery heresie at the first arising thereof. And euen some of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigens heresies, of which Bristowe taketh example, slept almost 200. yeares in his bookes, before they were o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly contradicted in the daies of Hieronyme, Ruffine and Augustine. Touching that I alledge of the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery of iniquity working in the Apostles time. 2. Thess. 2. Bristowe chargeth me to say, that the Church of Christ wrought this mystery of iniquity, wherein he doth me open iniury: for I knowe it was Satan which wrought it, but yet in the Church where Antichrist should sitte, and not without it. He asketh whether my text say, <hi>There was no preaching against it.</hi> I answere my text saith, it was a mystery not reuealed, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore could not at the first be openly preached against. But Antichrist being openly shewed, was preached a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst by the two witnesses, Apoc. 11. although he were not espied in the first mystery of iniquity, yea when he was yet in fashioning he was preached against by Irenae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us, Pollycrates, and others Ar. 36. and in this book. <hi>Cap.</hi> 9.</p>
               <p>The case of Cyprian and the Affricanes, being true pastors and yet contradicting the truth, and other true pastors denying that such as were baptised by heretikes were to be rebaptised, I haue clearely set down Pur. 413. but that Bristowe can do nothing but cauill.</p>
               <p>Allens rule is of the first rising of the persons, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto I require to be added that their opinion must also be newe, which if Bristowes blinde malice could haue seene, he needed not to haue painted his margent, with so many quotations, to proue that the true opinion was auncient and perpetuall.</p>
               <p>Where I shewed Ar. 93. that the Pope in secret, &amp; not by open contradiction, caused a most horrible blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous lake, called the Gospell of the holy Ghost, &amp;c. written by the Friers to be priuily burned, for sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming their order, which continued. 55. yeares, without reprehension of the Pope, or any, but such as were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted heretikes, Bristowe calling it fauourably, but a
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:13044:139"/>
new scandalous booke, asketh what fault it was. Verely such a fault, as proued him to be more zelous of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> glorie of beggerly friers, then of Christ and his Church, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can it be shadowed by the example of Augustine, at the first forbearing the name of Pelagius, while there was hope of amendment in him, and he not throughly vnderstoode his heresie. But contrary wise the Pope fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoureth the blasphe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

               <p>Where I saide, this was an argument from mans auc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tority negatiuely, &amp; therfore nothing worth: No man preached against Purgatory, and prayer for the dead, at their first entry: therefore they are true. Bristow saith, it is according to the Scriptures, Fathers and Histories, that <hi>All heres<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Bristowe saith he knoweth not in what Logike, I haue that axiome. He is a greate straunger in Aristotel, that knoweth not y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> a carcase, although he be called a man, yet is not a man in deede: moreouer he chargeth me to reason so my self in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> seuenth demand, where indeed I do only deride the vaine kinde of reasoninge from the name to the thing, when the name is not rightly giuen, retorting the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument vpon the Papists, who of vs are called heretiks, as we are of them.</p>

Bristowe biddeth me bate an ace of that, except I can shewe by predictions of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, the reprobation of the Christian worlde, in these daies, as they shew the reprobation of the Iewes in those daies.

Or as if it were not sufficient, to shewe the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish apostasie from the faith by those vndoubted notes, which the spirite speaking euidently doth giue of them. 1. Tim. 4. Beside this, Bristowe derideth me, for requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Iewes to vse those names which they neuer hearde of. And is Bristowe so well redde in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, that the name of true Church was neuer hearde of the Iewes in his opinion, as for the name of Catholique I required it not of them, neither do I thinke we ought to be tried by the bare name of Catholique, seeing we beleeue not barely and simply the Catholique, but the holy, Catholique, and Apostolique Church. <hi>Which Church is not called Catholique, because it should be euery where, (for that it neuer was, nor neuer shalbe) but because that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer it be in parts, it is one bodie of Christ.</hi> But here Bristowe taketh me vp for haulting, charging me to be the first of all heretikes, that say it is called <hi>Catholica,</hi> because it is <hi>Vna:</hi> but he playeth his olde parts, for I say it is Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique, because that being in diuerse parts, it is one, so that my reason is not only of vnitie but of vniuersa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the Church, which is Catholique in all the parts of it, being knitte in one, and not of being in euery particular place of the worlde, nor at all times in most places of the worlde. And with this holy Catholique Church of the whole worlde, our Church doth and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies hath communicated, when it was not so openly nor abundantly spredde in so many Nations as it is now. And therefore Augustine in the place by Bristowe

               <p>Where I proue, that the Popish Church is not in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery part of the worlde, and therefore cannot be called Catholique, in that respect: Bristowe saith it is iumpe the argument of Cresconius, and referreth vs for the answere to Saint Augustine. <hi>Con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

That there are such people as I saide, Munster in his Geographie of Aethiopia, doth testifie. As for the fable of their Emperours submission, and the Abbots approbation of Poperie in all pointes, may serue to play mocke holiday among the Papistes, they can haue no credite among vs. As great a mockerie it is, that Bristow

Actes of the Apostles were written to shewe into what faith all nations were conuerted, that were turned by the Apostles?</hi> Yea verily: they were written to shewe that the Apostles preached the same faith vnto the Iewes and Gentiles, which they receiued of Christ according to the holie Scriptures: and thereof the b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>, the practise of the Apostles, according to such instruction as thei receiued of Christ. Secondly he asketh <hi>is there so much as any mention of the twelue Apostles, preaching to any nation of the Gentiles?</hi> There is mention of the twelue Apostles preaching to the Iewes, and of their agreement in doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine to be preached to the Samaritans and Gentiles, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it was neither possible, nor needfull, nor conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient, that they should all twelue in person goe to euery nation. But what faith so euer any one preached to any nation, the same did they all preach without difference in euerie nation, that they conuerted. There is not one of the articles of the Creede necessarie to saluation, but it is to be proued by the Actes of the Apostles, that they did preach it. But Bristowe wil tell vs an other cause, why that booke was written. <hi>No sir</hi> (saith he) <hi>that booke was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to shewe, onely the beginning of the Church (according to the prophets) to wit, at Ierusale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; among the Iewes, and the taking of it from them for their deserts, and giuing it to the Gentiles, euen from Ierusalem the head of the Iewes, to Rome the head of the Gentiles.</hi> If this were the only purpose of the Euangelist, (as Bristowe most impudently affirmeth) he should haue spared much labour in setting foorth the sermons, and summe of the doctrine, which the Apostles preached both to the Iewes and Gentiles. But let vs heare Bristowe goe forward. <hi>And there Saint Luke endeth it, not caring to tell, so much as the fulfilling of that which our Lord had foretold Act. 27. to Saint Paule (in whose person this translation was wrought, and not in S. Peters for causes too long to be here rendered) Thou must stand before the Emperor. Because his purpose was no more, but to shewe the newe Ierusalem of the Christians, and so to leade them to it, to knowe what are the particulars that the Apostles taught.</hi> If this be true, all the testimonie and report that he maketh of their doctrine, was beside his purpose: yea,
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:13044:144"/>
the historie of the gospell which he writ of all things, that Iesus beganne to do and teach, was out of this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose. And he tooke the wrong way in writing his gospel to Theophilus, to teach him the certaintie of those things wherof he had bene instructed, as Saint Luke him selfe had receiued of the Apostles them selues, whereas according to Bristowes imaginatiue purpose, seeing there had ben manie writings of the gospel alreadie, he should haue sent him home to the newe Ierusalem of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, and so haue left him to it, to knowe what are the particulars the Apostles taught. But where on gods name learne wee, that whore of Babylon that sitteth vpon the seuen hilles, Apoc. 17. to be this newe Ierusalem on earth? when S. Paul. Gal. 4. bringeth all Christians from the earthly Ierusalem, vnto the heauenly Ierusale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which is aboue, and is the mother of vs all: not to an other Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem on earth, and that the mother of all abhomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the earth. Apoc. 17. And howe falleth it out, that S. Luke hauing a purpose, so long and certainely conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued, and so necessarie for the Church, not in one word commendeth to vs this newe Ierusalem, on the seuen hils, nor in one word maketh mention of that, which on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly changeth (if any thing can chaunge hell into heauen) Rome into Ierusalem, namely the translation of Peters chaire or his person, or the least haire of his head, or thred of his garment to Rome? But this belike is reserued a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Apocriphal causes; as these are, why the tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slation was in the person of S. Paule, and not of S. Peter.</p>
               <p>Where I required one of those nations, to whome the Apostles preached purgatorie or praier for the dead, to be named out of the Actes of the Apostles: Bristowe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swereth, continuing his former speach: <hi>And so withall you haue one of those nations named; and that no common one, to wit, the Romanes, which receiued of the Apostles not only that article you require, but all the rest which at this time it hath, &amp;c.</hi> When this is shewed out of the Actes of the Apostles, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Canonical scripture, I am answered.

Bristowe answereth, <hi>If you require vs to proue it out of the Scripture, considering that the Scripture doth not tell of our lands conuersion you declare your selfe to be but a pratler.</hi> At the least wise you declare, that you cannot proue it out of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.

In the tenth and twelfth Demands of Miracles and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, where I had cited the admonition of the Apostle, 2. Thessalon. 2. that the comming of Antichrist should be in all lying signes and wonders: Bristowe asketh me, what Scripture telleth me, that after the reuelation of Antichrist, there shall be none but feigned miracles? Wheras I inferred no such thing vpon the text, but shew euen that which he blameth me not to haue shewed, howe to knowe seigned miracles from vnfeigned, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by the doctrine which they are saide to confirme, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Scripture. Deut. 13.</p>
               <p>Where I saide, that Augustine <hi>De vnit. eccle. cap.</hi> 16. will allowe no miracles and visions for sufficient proofes, without the authoritie of Scriptures: Bristowe saith, I doe shamefully abuse my reader, for he saith expresse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <q>What so euer such thinges are done in the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Church, therefore they are to be allowed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they are done in the Catholike Church.</q> Yea sir, but it followeth that the Church is not shewed to be Catholike, because such things are done, but as he saith there and else where, onely by the Scriptures. But Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowe will haue me allowe all the miracles that Saint Augustine speaketh of, because they were done in the Catholike Church. As though Saint Augustine made that the sufficient cause to allowe any thing that was done or saide to be done, without ioyning that they were done to confirme the Catholike faith, Cyprians miracles could not iustifie his error. In the Popish Church, the sectes of Dominicanes and Franciscanes in their dissention, about the Conception of the virgin Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, boasted both of their miracles, yet Bristowe will not I weene allowe both their miracles, except he will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe both their opinions, which were contradictorie. Againe, many things are feigned, euen in the Catholike Church by peruerse zeale, to confirme truth, as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> historie of Paule and Tecla, confessed by a Priest of Asia <hi>Tert. de bapt.</hi> Neither wil Bristow I thinke defend, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> al y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> miracles contained in the Alcoran of Frances, <hi>Vitas patrum, Legend<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Festiual, and liues of so manie Saints as are written, be all true, and none feigned, although they all serue to proue Poperie. Wherefore it may be, that euen some of those miracles that S. Augustine doth report, might of emulation and vnordered zeale be feigned by some Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholikes, to winne credite to the Church, against here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes. That Luther and Caluine whome he affirmeth, not able to heale a lame horse, attempted wonders, it is as impudent a lie, and grosse forgerie, as that Li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Passing ouer 5. Demandes, which he doth only name: In the 18. of destroying idolatrie, he saith, that to all that he said, I say nothing, but like a cuckowe: <hi>You haue not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroied idolatrie, but set vp idolatrie, not waying</hi> (saith Bristowe) <hi>that I tell him according to the Prophets, that we haue throughly conuerted all nations from idolatrie, that we haue made them for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get also the names of their idols.</hi> In deede, that which Bristow telleth me, is of great weight, and therefore I am belike to blame, to wey it no more but as bare wordes without matter, and winde without reason or authoritie. Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise I thinke I haue proued, that the Papistes haue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted fewe nations from Paganisme, and them whome they haue turned, they haue rather chaunged the idols, then taken away the idolatrie, or rather the verie names, then the idols themselues, seeing there was neuer an idol almost among the Gentiles, but they retaine the idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie, vnder the name of one Saint or other.

That Allen citeth out of Ambrose, of Honorius standing by the holie altars, while the solemnitie of his fathers funerall was celebrated, maketh little to proue Honorius to haue bene a Papist, although in that point I denie not (which can not yet of those wordes be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued) that he might be occupied in praier for the deade, according to the errour of his time. One errour can not make a man to be altogether of the Popish faith, who is knowne to haue bene of that religion which Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brose setteth foorth in his writings, contrarie to Papi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strie, in the most, and most necessarie pointes vnto sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation. The 40. dayes minde, which Allen would begge out of that place, to resemble their Popish monethes minde, I haue sufficiently reproued, by shewing the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of the fourtie daies solemnitie, without inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission. That the last day was one of the fourtie, and kept with singular solemnitie (as is vsuall in such cases) which Bristowe opposeth, can not make a iust resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance

Where I challenge the Christian Emperors which were before the generall desection, to haue bene of our reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion: Bristowe in a lurious rage, noteth in the margent, <hi>Sce the impudent heretike, them whome he condemned before.</hi> But who is this impudent heretike, that condemned those Christian Emperors before? or where is there any word of their condemnation? Is there no difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene reprouing of an errour, and condemuing of the person? But let that passe among Bristowes impudent and malicious slaunders. The Kings of the earth (saith he) haue not committed fornication with the whore of Babylon, when they humblie adored the Church of Rome, and licked the dust of her feete, as they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded by the Prophet. Esai. 49. 60. &amp;c. This shall be confessed when it is proued, that the Popish Church is the spouse of Christe, and not the strumpet of Babylon, although the Prophet speake not of bodily bowing, kissing, or licking.

               <p>In the 21.

The cause wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e the Apostle renounced their temples, was for that manie of them were not for the vse of Christian religion, although if credite may be giuen to our countrie histories, the Pagans temples were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted to Christian Churches, both by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Brytons &amp; Sax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. But those conuerters, saith Bristowe, were the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of them: be it so, yet were they not the builders of them. Yet such as were builded by Christian princes, were builded that their soules might be praied for in them, as that Church of the twelue Apostles builded by Constantine the great, whereof mention is before &amp;c. Of so manie Chruches as he builded, onely in building that one, he had that erronious conceit. Where I say, the olde Churches were builded onely in the honor of God, and the Popish temples in the honor of creatures, Saints, and Angels: <hi>Marie wellymet,</hi> quod Bristowe: <hi>They were cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Basilicae Martyrum &amp; Apostoloru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, the Apostles and the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs Churches, &amp;c. Ergo,</hi> They were not builded to the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of God onely, but to the honour of creatures, when the olde writers whome I cite <hi>Ar.</hi> 53. 55. affirme, that a temple belongeth onely to God. And Augustine expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly denieth, that they were the temples, but the memories of those Martyrs, whose names they bare, and as foral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars, he vtterly denieth them vnto creatures.</p>
               <p>Where I said, that Constantine made his great grants to the married Bishops of Rome: Bristowe crieth, bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing on Iouinian. Whie Bristowe, Was there neuer any Bishop of Rome married? Was there no priest married
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:13044:148"/>
in Hierome and Augustines time, although Iouinian could not persuade anie priest which had purposed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinencie to marrie? To that I saide of manie of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thedrall Churches in England, builded for preachers and their wiues to dwell in, Bristowe saith, I haue wonne a whetstone as bigge as a mountaine, but against the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie of the histories, Ranulph. Cest. Math. Westm. Petriburgens. and other which I cited, Bristow bringeth nothing, but railing in filthie termes, meete for the col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Cardinals life, &amp; not for the holie estate of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimonie.</p>
               <p>Where I shewe the differing forme of the chauncels &amp; altars of the auncient Churches, with crosse yles from the latter Popish erections: Bristowe maketh me a sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den proctor of theirs, as though a chauncel and altar, a crosse barre, might not be named but by a Papist. Yea, he maketh me contrarie to my selfe, for saying that Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish chauncels, which are at the East end of Churches, are but late additions: and sanctifieth, that we can abide no chauncels, no crosse yles, no length to the East, &amp;c. of which things we make small account, either to haue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or to be without them. But it is more materiall, that he saith, Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>stantinus had <hi>tabernaculum crucis,</hi> a tabernacle or moucable Church of the crosse, wheras we can abide no crosse or roode in our Churches, <hi>Euseb. in vit. Const. lib. 2. cap. 12. lib 4. cap. 56, Sozomen lib. 1. cap.</hi> 8. The two latter places shewe, that in his warres he vsed to haue a tent or taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle, as a Church, for praier and ministration of the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments: the first place onely calleth it <hi>tabernaculum crucis,</hi> which might be of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> forme; but of any crosse that was in it, there is no mention, and much lesse of a rood, which is a crosse with an image on it. As for the crosse which Paulinus the superstitious Bishop of Nola, saith was kept in the Church of Ierusalem, worshipped by the Bishop and the people, if it were true, yet it proueth not creeping to the crosse on Good Friday, as Bristow saith, for there might be worshipping without creeping, or Popish worshipping either. Againe, worshipping of that same crosse that Christ died on, proueth not creeping to
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:13044:149"/>
any idol of it. Finally, where he would proue out of Paulinus and Beda, the multitude of altars in one Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che, he laboureth in vaine. Eusebius whome I cited, is cleare both of the vnitie of the altar in his time, and of the manner of standing, which was not after the popish manner. Of like wisedome it is, that he will not allowe me to talke of chalices of wood and glasse, because I say their vestiments be as good stuffe as their chalices, which the olde Church knewe not. <hi>Thereof he chargeth me not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

The rest that he ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, out of antiquitie for gorgeous attire, and golden chalices, partly is false, and partly superfluous.

               <p>Where I affirme, the auncient Churches were without images, because the tempse of God, and images can not agree &amp;c. Bristowe saith, I may roll in such rhetorike be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore fooles, that receiue our absurde principles, to wit, <hi>That the idols of the Pagans, were images of the Christians.</hi> But thinketh Bristowe, that any of our auditors is so foolish, to beleeue so absurde a principle, as he is malitious in feigning vs to affirme such an impossible paradoxe? I am sure, it neuer entred into the opinion of any preacher, to imagine, that the idols of the Pagans were the images of Christians. But this we say, that Popish images, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they be not the same that were the images of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Heathen, yet they are as abhominable idols as theirs, &amp; the worshipping of them as much to be abhorred of all true Christians, as the worshipping of the images of the Gentiles, and for proofe of that, neither you, nor Sander shall euer finde me <hi>non plus,</hi> as you say you make me, by denying y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> absurd principle, which is of your owne fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tasticall imagination, and not of our ignorant and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned affirmation, as you feigne it. As touching our li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uings, we are nothing discouraged by the storie of Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brose <hi>de Basilicis tradendis,</hi> but that we may enioie them with a better conscience, then you compare vs, with the Arrians, and our most Christian Prince, to the Arrian Empresse.</p>

<pb n="289" facs="tcp:13044:150"/>
two errors of praier for the dead, and to Saintes, were in the olde Church, of three or foure hundreth yeares after Christ, I will not tarie to declare. But where I note out of S. Augustine, affirming that no sacrifice ought to be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to Martyrs: seeing praier is a sacrifice, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it ought to be offered only to God: and that Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs were not called vpon in the time of the sacrifice, but onely named for remembrance: Bristowe to proue that they were called vpon, contrarie to the expresse wordes of Augustine, citeth Augustine, <hi>Tract in Ioan.</hi> 84. speaking of the blessed Martyrs: <q>
                     <hi>Non sic eos commemoramus &amp;c.</hi> We doe not so rehearse them, as other that rest in peace, that we also pray for them, but rather y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they may pray for vs, that we may cleaue to their steppes.</q> These words proue not, that they did in publike seruice call vpon the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs with solemne praiers, but onely interpret, what Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine supposed the meaning of the publike liturgie to be, in that place, where the Martyrs were named among other that are in rest, for whome they did pray, as appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth more plainely, by the other place, which Bristowe quoteth <q>
                     <hi>
                        <q>De verb. Apost. 17.</q> Perfectio tamen, &amp;c</hi> Yet there is some kinde of perfection in this life, vnto which the holie Martyrs are come. Therfore the Ecclesiasticall dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline hath that which the faithfull doe knowe, when the Martyrs are rehearsed in that place at the altar of God, where praier is not made for them; but for the rest of the departed, that are rehearsed, praier is made. For it is an iniurie to pray for a Martyr, by whose praiers we ought to be commended.</q> Note also in the former sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, that they praied for them that did rest in peace; therefore they praied not for deliuerance out of purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie, where they are saide to be in paine without rest. The other places, which he noteth, of priuate persons praying to Saints, proueth not, that such praier was vsed in the publike seruice of the Church, which although perhaps it were not syncere in all points, yet was it much elder, than the error of inuocation of Saintes. Where I note that no sacrifice was to be offered vnto Martyrs: Bristowe saith, it is to be vnderstoode, of externall sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:13044:151"/>
as though the Christians had any but eucharisticall or of prosperities But admitting his distinction of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall and internall sacrifice, howe are the Gentiles an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered by Saint Augustine, that we worship not Saintes as Gods, when we offer spirituall sacrifice to them, which is most proper to God, which is a spirit, and challengeth the spirituall worship vnto him selfe? You might as well graunt them externall temples, as spirituall sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, and much rather. For if they must haue spirituall and internall sacrifice, they must haue a spirituall and internal temple, wherein and vpon which, it must be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered; which is all one, as if you will dispossesse the holy Ghost of his temple, and set vp an other altar in mans heart, to offer vp sacrifice vnto Martyrs therevpon. But Bristowe, as it were, giuing ouer his former distinction, saith praier to Saintes, is no more a sacrifice to Saintes, then those dishes of meate, which of some Christians were superstitiously brought into the Churches, as Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine sheweth, to be sanctified by the merites of the the Martyrs, <hi>de ciuit. lib. 8. cap</hi> 27. But the Prophet saith, A troubled spirite, (which sendeth foorth praiers) is a sacrifice vnto God, Psal. 51. and therefore ought not to be offered to creatures; and Psal. 140. he desireth, that his praier may be as incense, &amp; the euening sacrifice, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Concerning ceremonies, he chargeth me to refuse al, by mine argument of authoritie of Gods worde nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuely, and yet in other wordes to allowe some. Who so will conferre the places, shall easily see his witlesse and senselesse cauelling. I refuse all superstitious and idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous ceremonies, but the word of God alloweth such as are necessarie for order and decencie, not hindering, but furthering edification. The order of seruice and mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration, which Iustinus describeth the Church to haue vsed, containeth a summe of all that we vse in our litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie. Bristowe saith, it is the summe of the Masse also, and there is water mingled with wine, plaine against the Communion booke. As for the mingling of water with wine, howe proueth he, that it is named as a necessarie ceremonie vsed in that time, and not rather to declare,
<pb facs="tcp:13044:151"/>
how soberly the Christians vsed wine in those mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinges, which were so malitiously slaundered? But if it were a ceremonie, what hath it contrarie to the communion booke, which although it require no more then Christ vsed, yet it forbiddeth not the addition of water, if any necessarie occasion doe require it? But I would faine see the masse disciphered out of that description of Iustine, which Bristowe saith, is the verie summe of the masse. <hi>Vnlesse Fulke be so foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish to thinke, saith he, that the Bishoppes sermon, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing of all present, the carying of it to them that be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, the rich mens offering may not to be omitted in any masse, or for any cause.</hi> What so euer may be vsed or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted at any masse, or for any cause, I am not so wise, that I knowe, nor so carefull that I desyre to knowe. But is Bristowe so madde, to make any indued with reason to thinke, that Iustinus describeth, that which was seldome or neuer vsed among them, rather then that which was vniformely obserued in all their meetinges?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But out of the scripture I reason affirmatiuely reiecting all the beggerly ceremonies of poperie, because God is to be worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped in spirite &amp; truth, and yet in an other place, I admit som fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture: therefore (saith Bristowe,) that I haue misused this text, with much babbling to little purpose.</hi> Mine answere is, that although some external rites, are necessarie for or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and decencie, yet the true and proper worshippe of God, is onely in spirite and veritie, and consisteth not in externall rites, no not when they are best vsed.</p>
               <p>Secondly, against popishe lessons, responses, versicles, lewde lyes and vncertaine tales, read and songe as Gods seruice: &amp;c. I alledged Mathewe, 15.

Here he taxeth mine ignorance in the scripture saying, <hi>that the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of men are those which be of men and not of GOD.</hi> And are not lewde lyes, and vncertaine tales such? yea, all your vaine distinctions of popish seruice: for which you cannot shewe any one commaundement of GOD, nor allowance of the Godly Church, but of
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:13044:152"/>
the synagogue of Sathan, which your beggerly Logike craueth in this aunswere, to be taken for the Catholike Church of Christ. After this he chargeth me, to falsifie the Councel of Laodicea <hi>cap.</hi> 59. when I say it decreed, That nothing should be song or read in the Church, but the Canonicall bookes of the holie Scripture. Vnto which accusation, I aunswere, that I gaue the summe of the Councel, truely and without any falsification. That nothing should be read in the Church beside the Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall bookes of the Scripture, which are there named, Bristowe confesseth, and the wordes of the Canon are plaine. This is sufficient to ouerthrowe Popish lessons, where of nine, most commonly not one is of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. But Bristowe will make three Councels of Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage, ca. 47. to expound this Canon of Laodicea, where it is commaunded that nothing be read vnder the name of the diuine Scriptures, but only the Canonical Scriptures. If this exposition were allowed, yet Popish seruice is not discharged; for therein, the Machabees and other Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cryphall Scriptures, which the Councel of Laodicea doth reiect, are read as the diuine Scriptures. And as for mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to be soung, the Councel reiecting Psalmes made by vnskilfull persons, meaneth to admit none but either the Psalmes and Hymnes of the Scripture, or at least, such as are consonant vnto them: and therefore would neuer haue admitted that blasphemous versicle, or what the diuel so euer you call it: <hi>Tu per Thomae sanguinem quem pro te impendit, Fac nos, Christe, scandere, quò Thomas ascendit.</hi> By the bloud of Thomas which for thee he did spend, Make vs, Christ, to climbe whither Thomas did ascend. Nor a great number of such, not onely vnlearned songs, but wicked and hereticall ditties, that are contained in your Popish portuise.</p>
               <p>Where I said, the festiuall daies were kept of the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitiue Church, not in honour of the Saints, as they are of the Papistes, but only for the memorie of the Martyrs, &amp;c. to imitation: Bristowe opposeth a saying of Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine, which to imitation addeth consociation to the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites, and aide of their praiers. <hi>Cont. Faust. lib. 20. cap.</hi> 21. As
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:13044:152"/>
for fellowship of their worthinesse, is the fruit of imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the helpe of their praiers, is a smacke of that decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning time, which Bristowe alwaies obtrudeth to vs, as the onely primitiue Church, which I vnderstand for the first Church of the Apostles, and that which was most aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent next vnto them.</p>
               <p>Where I cite out of Augustine, <hi>de ver. rel. cap.</hi> 55. that Saints and Angels were of Christians in his time honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, with loue, not with seruice; for imitation, not for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion: First Bristowe asketh, whether he doth not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressely here auouch their honouring? Yes verily, and as expressely he denieth that they are to be honoured with seruice of religion. But <hi>seruitus</hi> with Bristowe, is not the Latine of the Greeke word <hi>Dulia,</hi> it is but mine vnac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance is Saint Augustines writings. If mine ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance in S. Augustines writings, were as smal as his skill is in the Greeke language, I might be accounted a great straunger in them. But let vs heare what Bristowes familiaritie with Saint Augustine hath found of the sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification of <hi>Dulia.</hi> 
                  <q>
                     <hi>
                        <bibl>De ciuit. Dei. lib. 10. cap. 1.</bibl> Latriam quippe nostri vbicunque &amp;c.</hi> Where so euer in the holie Scriptures, is put <hi>Latria,</hi> our interpreters haue translated it <hi>seruitus &amp;c.</hi>
                  </q> verie well: therefore the olde Latine inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters iudged <hi>Latria</hi> and <hi>Doulia</hi> to be all one. For euen so haue they translated <hi>Doulia,</hi> alwaies by the word <hi>ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uitus.</hi> as Exod 6. 13 20. Rom. 8. Gal. 4. 5. Heb. 2. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Saint Augustine not finding a proper Latine worde, to expresse the worship of God, and chosing <hi>Latria</hi> the Greeke word, doth onely shewe howe it was his pleasure to vse the terme, and not what the worde doth properly signifie. For <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>,) for wages. And therefore like a learned Grecian, Bristowe, saith <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> is <hi>synonomum</hi> to <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> is neuer vsed but for worship of GOD, or superstition, or religion: <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> is a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall name for any kinde of seruice due either to GOD or men. But what shall I reason with such a blocke, as challengeth all authenticall seruice, that euer hath
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:13044:153"/>
bene in any Church to be the Popish seruice, although it differ from it both in forme and matter, euen as before he saide, that Iustines description is the verie summe of the Masse.</p>
               <p>Concerning the tongue in which the seruice is, Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowe saith, it maketh no difference in the seruice it selfe: but because I holde that it ought to be in the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar tongues, he will consider my groundes thereof. First, the fourteenth of the first to the Corinthians, proueth it not, because he speaketh there of a mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous gift of tongues. A strong reason, I promise you, nay much rather if a speciall gift of the holie Ghoste, must giue place to the edifying of the Church, much rather an vnknowne tongue, superstitiously v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surped, must be abolished.</p>
               <p>Secondly he saith, <hi>Saint Paule doth not reiect the gift, but moderate it, for the varietie of certaine, much like to some Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testantes, that thinke all learning to be the tongues,</hi> and quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth Pur. 7. It was not meete, that Saint Paule should reiect a gift of the holie Ghost, but shewe the right vse of it. But where Bristowe noteth me to thinke all learning to be the tongues, and quoteth the place, he sheweth him selfe to bee a shamelesse lier: for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though I exemplifie such learning, as is most necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie for the vnderstanding of the Scriptures, by know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of tongues and rationall sciences: yet it follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not, that I thinke all learning; or all learning neede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for that purpose, to be knowledge of the tongues and rationall sciences, much lesse to be the onely know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the tongues, as this proude Asse ignorant in the tongues, and almost in all good learning, without all foreheade, or with an yron or brasen face, doeth lewdly belie me. But if any man thinke (saith Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowe) that one may argue of that Chapiter <hi>a simili: Let him consider, first, that so, the manner of simple Catholikes, who praie to them selues priuately in the Latine tongue, which they vnderstande not, is not condemned, but iustified.</hi> A harde matter, to iustifie superstitious ignoraunce, by simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:13044:153"/>
of the heauenly giftes of Gods spirite, which is the spirite of trueth and knowledge. Yes, saith Bristowe, he that speaketh in a tongue, speaketh not to men but to God. Yea sir, but doth he say, he that speaketh in a tongue which he vnderstandeth not him selfe? Againe the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle saith, he that speaketh in a tongue, doeth edifie him selfe: Verily he that speaketh in a tongue, which he vnderstandeth no more then a Parot, edifieth not him selfe, nor any other. Againe he saith: if I pray in a tongue, my spirite praieth, but my vnderstanding or minde is vnfruitfull: which wordes Bristowe hath impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently falsified, saying, <hi>For if I praie in a tongue, my spirite</hi> (or affection) <hi>praieth, though my vnderstanding be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out fruite.</hi> Where not onely hee taketh spirite for a blinde affection, which is meant of a spirituall gift, but also would beare vs in hande, that Saint Paule iustified praier with affection voide of vnderstanding, where it followeth immediatly, that he will him selfe, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horte all other to pray, not onely in spirit, or spirituall gift, but also with mind or vnderstanding, which shall be fruitfull vnto other. But he saith further, as Bristow ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth him to say, <hi>If thou blesse or giue thanks in spirit, thou doest it well:</hi> Where neither his wordes, nor meaning is such, but speaketh of them which vse that spirituall gift of tongues, to expresse godlie praier or thankesgiuing, which serue not to edifie the congregation, but doth not iustifie that what so euer a man shall speake in praier or thankesgiuing with affection, is well spoken, although the speaker vnderstand not what he say. For howe can he blesse or giue thankes well, that knoweth not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he blesse or cursse, in the wordes which he vttereth, with neuer so good affection? Lastly, hee citeth out of Saint Paule: If there bee no interpreter, let him be silent in the Church, and speake to him selfe and to GOD. And hereof Bristowe will-conclude, that mother B. is iustified to say her <hi>Aui Mari, Daminus stickum &amp;c.</hi> As though he that spake in such a tongue as no man present could interprete, and he him selfe that spake
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:13044:154"/>
it, did not vnderstand what he spake: but spake meerely in the aire.</p>
               <p>The second thing that Bristowe would haue <hi>to be considered, is that the Church in her publike prayers, doth not speake in a tongue, because the Latine tongue is not in England a straunge tongue, so as it were if one should say Masse at Rome in the English tongue.</hi> And whie so I pray thee, Bristowe? Because in England heere and there one, vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the Latine tongue? Verily in Rome there be some also that vnderstand the English tongue. Thinke you Bristowe could haue this consideration without his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering cap? and therevpon concludeth, <hi>And so the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion is not nowe the same as was betweene the Apostle and the Corinthians: But whereas the Church would doe all thinges for edification, the question is, whether this be obtained in the publike prayers of the whole world, rather by the Latine tongue, that is to say, by the common tongue, or else by the seuerall tongues, that is to say, by the priuate tongues.</hi> Whie, howe nowe Bristowe? is the Latine tongue the common tongue of the whole worlde? You that haue all learning be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side the tongues, will you denie all other tongues to be common, but the Latine? But to let that passe, <hi>the Catholikes haue one aunswere to this question, drawing all <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>o common or vnitie,</hi> with a little helpe you may by the same corde, drawe in the communitie and vnitie of Plato and the Anabaptistes: but in the meane while, your edification is voide of instruction. But that is a small matter with you, to driue all men into a common heape of ignorance and superstition, which is your draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all to common or vnitie.</p>
               <p>But to come to examples of the primitiue Church, he saith I can not denie, but that all nations of the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine Church, had the seruice in Latine: I say, all nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that vnderstoode the Latine tongue, as their vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar speach, but not all nations of the West, which vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstoode it not. That most nations vnderstoode the Latine tongue, which he calleth an absurde position, he saith I proue it, by the Germane or French Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels of Toures, Magunce, and Rhemes, by which I ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:13044:154"/>
shewe the decaie of the Latine tongue in those re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions. But my proues are other then he is able to aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere, and therefore he letteth them passe, cauelling that the Latine tongue was hard vnto the people, where I shewe the decaie of it: As also that the French tongue at this day is in some places called the Romane, where I shewe the continuaunce of the rusticall Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane tongue in Fraunce, out of the Councel of Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron 3. cap. 17. as though the French tongue at this day, were not much declined from the similitude which it had with the pure Latine tongue, seuen or eight hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth yeares agoe. To the decree of the Councel of Laterane cap. 9. which commaunded, that Ministers should be prouided, which according to the diuersitie of rites and languages, should celebrate diuine seruice, and minister the sacraments, to people of diuers lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages, being conuersant in one citie. Bristowe aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swereth, the Bishoppes were not commaunded to tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slate the seruice into English, and other vulgar tongues, but to prouide Ministers according to the rites and lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages in which the seruice presently was. Yes sir, they were commaunded to prouide Ministers to serue them according to the diuersitie of languages, that were in euerie citie, where were people of diuers ton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues. But otherwise Bristowe asketh me, whie it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uideth for those cities and diocesses in which were peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of diuers languages, and not for all in generall. I aunswere the prouision is generall, according to the diuersitie of languages in any citie or diocesse. Last of all, he asketh whie suche translation was in no place put in execution? But first I must aske him howe he proueth that in no place it was put in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution? And although it were not, it declareth the negligence of the Bishops, not the vnderstanding of the Canon.</p>
               <p>In the foure and twentie Demaund of Priesthoode and sacrifice, he chargeth vs with apostasie, for transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Priesthoode, whereof must followe a tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slation of the lawe. Which apostasie falleth right vpon
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:13044:155"/>
the Papistes, which translated the Priesthoode of Christ which he hath <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> without succession, vnto their blasphemous sacrificing Priesthood. But let vs see what balde reason he bringeth, to proue that we haue transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Priesthood. First we haue laboured to chaunge the Apostolicall names of <hi>Episcopus</hi> and <hi>Presbyter,</hi> into su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perintendent &amp; elder. So a translation out of Greeke in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Latine, or English, is a chaunge with him: and such as may not be abidden, for he reproueth me for transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting <hi>Presbyterum</hi> in Cyprian, an elder.</p>
               <p>Secondly, I helpe an other argument of theirs, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding out of Ephes. 4. that the Popish Hierarchie is no part of Christian Ministerie: by which I declare, that we haue chaunged the Priesthoode of the Primitiue Church, which had Popish Bishops, Priestes, Deacons, Subdeacons, Exorcistes, Cantors, Acolytes, Ostiaries, for which he citeth <hi>Eusebius lib. 6. cap.</hi> 34. where there is no such matter named, either in the Greeke or Latine computation of Grynaeus. I confesse the names are auncient, and the offices in the Primitiue Church, were some necessarie, some profitable, but I speake of the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish Hierarchie, in which nothing remaineth but the names. But Bristowe thinketh I do not consider, that S. Paule nameth there, the onely Ministers of the worde or preachers. Yes verily: and therfore I exclude all these Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish orders, which are such euery one of them as may be and are giuen to men, that are no preachers or ministers of the word. As for the order of Christian Deacons, for ministring to the poore, and Elders of gouernement, I knowe they are not to be sought in that rehearsall. But for those Popish orders that Bristow saith, belong to the ministerie of the altar, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Scripture speaketh no one word of them. Yet he saith, I may see the distinction of them, Act. 13. where some preachers had not orders, &amp; 1. Tim. 3. where some good Priestes do not labour in the word and doctrine. Concerning the first place, I knowe not what he meaneth, except he thinke Paule and Barnabas were not Apostles, before handes were laid on them, and they dismissed to preach abroad among the Gentiles. Or else,
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:13044:155"/>
that those Prophetes and teachers named in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Chapter, had nowe orders, which howe he proueth I maruell, specially seeing other Papistes doe vnderstand the worde <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which signifieth mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>string, for their sacrificing.</p>
               <p>As for the other place is of Elders of gouernement, and not Priestes of the Altar. That the auncient writers vsed the names of <hi>Sacerdotes, Leuitae, Pontifices,</hi> it was not because the ministers of the Gospell are a <hi>species</hi> or kinde of them, but abusiuely, for a certaine similitude of the Leuiticall order and Priesthoode, with the ministers of the word and sacraments.</p>
               <p>Thirdly he saith, the Apostles, Bishops, and Priestes, were made by other Bishops and Priestes; ours by Lay men, as of Kings and ciuile Magistrates, which is an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent slaunder.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, wee confesse their orders to bee good y<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, because we reorder not them, which is false: for I saide, their admission of the Church is a newe calling. Bristowe saith, that is a newe way to giue or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, shewing him selfe ignorant, that euen in the olde Church, suche as were ordained by some heretikes, were receiued after they had abiured their heresie, to continue in the degree of the Cleargie, as of the Noua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, <hi>Concil. Nicen. cap.</hi> 8. Wherefore the rest of his bab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling, <hi>O your Diuinitie, O your Scripture, as that I bring no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to defend Pilkington, not to be a mocke Bishop, but his excellent learning and diligent preaching &amp;c.</hi> I passe ouer, as also the great preaching, which nowe at the last, is in Popish countries, where within these threescore yeares, was as great silence as in England at the same time.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, arguments neede not, where I denie all Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoode, but the spirituall Priesthoode common to all Christians.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, If I will inuent a thirde Priesthoode, hee saith <hi>that the Primitiue or Fathers Priesthoode was according to the order of Melchisedech, and to offer sacrifice in breade</hi>

                  <hi>and wine as Melchisedek &amp; Christ did.</hi> Beware what you say, of a sacrifice of bread and wine offered by you &amp; Christ, as by Melchisedek: <hi>But you regarde not our arguments, they be but obiections.</hi> At leastwise I pray you answere our ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iections, or else they wilbe argumentes to proue you all blasphemous vsurpers of Christs singular priesthood. But that you wil doe at leasure, &amp; first you will proue your priesthood out of Augustine, <hi>Contr. aduers. Leg. &amp; Prophet. Lib. Cap. 19 &amp;</hi> 20. Where he defendeth the sacrifice of the Church to be after the order of Melchisedek, and yet but a sacrifice of praise. So that you haue neither your sacrifice propitiatorie, whereof the controuersie is, nor your particular priesthood, for he saith: <q>The Church from the Apostles time &amp;c. doth offer to God in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Christ a sacrifice of praise &amp;c. not after the order of Aaron, but after the order of Melchisedeck.</q> Now who knoweth not, that the sacrifice of praise, is a spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual sacrifice, common to al the Church, and not pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar to any special order of priesthood? So that S. Auga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine naming y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> order of Melchisedek, alludeth to those places of the scripture, in which all Christians are called a royall priesthood, &amp; Kinges and priestes 1. Pet. 2. Apoc. 1. but neuer intended to make the singular priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of Christ, confirmed to him by oath, Psalm. 110. and which passeth not from him, Heb. 7. common to ministers of the Church. If you obiect, He speaketh of celebration of the sacrament which is peculiar to them: I answere although the ministration of the sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be proper vnto them, yet the sacrifice of praise offered in the celebration, is common to the whole Church, as Augustine both here and else where affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth. So that although a sacrifice be graunted, yet a special priesthood is not proued. <hi>But the sacrifice of the crosse was both of thankesgiuing, &amp; of propitiatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, he troweth: and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the memoriall sacrifice of the altar to be the one, what doth it let to be the other?</hi> This argument standing vpon Bristowes trowing, and confounding the members of a diuision, shall haue none other answere for me. The places that I cite out of Ambrose, <hi>ad virg. laps. &amp; de
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:13044:157"/>
virgin. Lib.</hi> 1. to proue that he vseth the names of sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice and propitiation, vnproperly, as other of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers doe, Bristow will not allow as sufficient, saying I might as wel so argue, that S. Paule speaketh vnproperly, because he saith our bodies by mortification to be made a liuing sacrifice. whereas the Apostle, Heb. 10. saith Christs body by death to be made a sacrifice. And what offence is it to say S. Paule speaketh vnproperly, where he speaketh figuratiuely? as when he saith the rock was Christ. Howbeit in this example of Bristow, there is great difference, but that such a blunderer as he cannot see it, which confoundeth the propitiatorie sacrifice of Christ, with the eucharisticall sacrifice of Christians, as he confounded them both in the sacrifice of the Crosse: the one could not be offered, without death of the sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice and sacrificer, the other is offered continually, the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificer liuing.</p>
               <p>As for his rule to know proper and vnproper spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, let him trie to teach his pupils: when I am dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to learne, I will chuse a better learned teacher.</p>
               <p>But now he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth to answere obiections. First I sayd the bringing foorth of bread and wine, was no part of Melchisedeks priesthood, seeing the Apostle comparing him with Christ, in all thinges in which he was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable, neuer teacheth it, as any part of his priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood. This argument Bristow maketh to be of one place of Scripture negatiuely, not consideting it is the onely place, where such comparison is made, and that it is absurd to thinke, the Apostle would omit so prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall a part of Melchisedeks and Christs priesthood. But Bristow will examine the text. First their vulgar translation, begining at <hi>proferens,</hi> both gelding the text, &amp; falsely translating <hi>At verò Melchisedek rex Salem, profe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rens panem &amp; vinum (erat enim sacerdos dei altissimi) bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dixit ei, &amp;c.</hi> But truly Melchisedek King of Salem, bringing foorth bread and wine (for he was the priest of the highest GOD) blessed him saying. What doth this context helpe him, which is as much to say as he blessed him because he was a priest? Bristow,
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:13044:158"/>
fraudulently omitteth the parenthesis, and in transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, changeth the participle into the verbe. <hi>But in the Hebrue</hi> (If we beleeue Bristowe) <hi>the poynting de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth, that also the Rabbines themselues take it in the same sort.</hi> What a greate Rabbine is Bristowe sodenly growne to be, since his departure out of Oxforde? But what poynting should declare this, he sheweth not, neither can I gesse. The text is: And Melchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedek King of Salem brought foorth bread and wine: there is the middle of the verse: then it followeth: And he was a Priest, of the highe GOD, there is the end: then it followeth, And he blessed him &amp;c. In deede Rabby Salomon, but not in respect of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny poynting sayth of the bringing foorth of bread and wine, for a true exposition, First that it was vsuall to doe so to men, that were wearied in warre: also that thereby he shewed, that he was not offended with him for killing of his Children, for he taketh Melchisedek to be Sem, the middle sonne of Noach: Secondly for a Mideash, or vaine exposition, that it was to signifie the Minchoth and Nesecuth the meat of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feringes, and the drinke offeringes, which his children or posteritie, should offer in that place, not that Melchisedek in respecte that he was a Prieste, did bring foorth bread and wine. <hi>But all the Fathers doe agree in this similitude of Melchisedeches Priesthood with CHRIST.</hi> I knowe that many doe so, but one Apostle is of greater authoritie then they all, yet none of them all speaketh of a Priesthoode, to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer vp the naturall bodie of Christ in a propitiatorie sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, which is the principall matter in question.</p>
               <p>But if Melchisedek were a Prieste, Bristowe will aske me, what was his sacrifice, if it were not bread and wine, seeing none other is mentioned?</p>
               <p>For my part, I am not ashamed to be ignorant of that, which the Holy Ghost hath not reueiled. Sure I am, if bread and wine had beene his sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, and the sacrifice of Christ also: the Apostle would not haue omitted it, which compareth much
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:13044:158"/>
smaler matters in him, with Christ then that.</p>
               <p>Where I say, it is horrible blasphemie, to chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge the Priesthoode according to the order of Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chisedek, which is singular to Christ: Psalm. 110. and Heb. 7. Bristowe asketh, if the scripture say not, that there is one baptizer which is Christ, and yet all are not blasphemers that are baptisers. I answere, if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny take vpon him to baptise, with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> holy ghost and with fire, he is an horrible blasphemer. But to baptise with water, that is to be ministers of the outwarde sacrament, in which onely Christ baptiseth inwardly, Christ hath called all those ministers of his word and sacramentes. Shewe you the like calling for your blasphemous Priesthood, after the order of Melchise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dek, or else your example of baptisers will not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge you of horrible blasphemie. But you haue another docterlike argument, when you haue scof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed out my poore doctershippe. <hi>Were not all the rest in the olde time the ministers of Aaron, but Aaron himselfe was Priest onely in his owne time, and after him euerie one in his time was Priest as well as he, and therefore in that law were many Priestes.</hi> He asketh the question, as though it were out of question. <hi>Were not all.</hi> &amp;c. O famous and illuminate doctor, where did your docters hoode learne, that all the high Priestes successiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, (whereof euerie one was a figure of Christ as much as Aaron) were ministers of Aaron? For you speake of high Priestes, or else what meane you to say, that Aaron him selfe was priest onely in his owne time, for all his sonnes were priests, although he onely the high priest in his time. Vpon this stronge foundation, you build a similitude and dissimilitude. <hi>So that the olde testament was like to England since the conquest, hauing succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siuely many Kinges, But the newe testament is like to England du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>during the time of one King: who being but one, yet hath many ministers, as one might say so many ministerial kinges.</hi> You shew learning ynough in this similitude and dissimilitude to make you a doctor after y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> popes order. But let vs vnder correctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of your doctors hood, examine your co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pariso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:13044:159"/>
The olde Testament was like England since the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest, hauing successiuely many Kings. Had not euerie of those kings, many Ministers vnder them? And euerie Aaronicall priest had also many Priestes and Leuites vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him? And was not Christ head of the Church of the Iewes, in the seuerall times of euery the high Priest? Wherefore the olde testament is as like to England du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the time of one King, as the newe in those pointes, but the difference is this: that the figuratiue high priestes were many, because they could not continue, but by death were alwaies chaunged: Christ being an euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting Priest, hath a priesthoode that descendeth not by succession: so that although he haue many ministers, yet he onely hath the euerlasting priesthoode, which is according to the order of Melchisedek, Heb. 7. As for your terme of ministeriall kings, howe well it agreeth to your shauen crownes, I will not stand here to discusse.</p>
               <p>My third argument, as Bristowe calleth it, is this: <hi>The Apostle to the Hebrues cap. 10. teacheth vs, that Christ offering but one sacrifice for our sinnes (and that but once cap. 9.) hath made perfect for euer those that are sanctified: that our sinnes are taken away by that sacrifice, and therefore there is no more sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice for sinnes left.</hi> To this Bris<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>owe aunswereth, that I doe not vnderstand, what the Apostle meaneth by those that are sanctified; by their making perfect; by sacrifice for sinne. The sanctified are onely the newe baptized by his iudgement, for which he quoteth 1. Cor 6. where the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle saith: But nowe you are washed, you are sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, you are iustified, by the name of our Lord Iesus, and by the spirit of our God. By which he plainely sheweth, that although they were baptized long before, and had committed many sinnes sithence their baptisme, yet the cleannesse of their washing, the holinesse of their sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, the righteousnesse of their iustification, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained still, and therefore exhorteth them to keepe it to the end. So that while Bristowe (as he doth alwaies) char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth me with ignorance, not knowing what is meant by their making perfect: he incurreth great forgetfulnesse, euen of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Apostles words where he expou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth, which are
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:13044:159"/>
not onely, he hath made perfect, but, he hath made perfect for euer, them that are sanctified. So that if sanctification were restrained to baptisme, which no logike can proue, yet it followeth, that they which are sanctified by Christes death in baptisme, are made per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect not for a moment, as these obstinate blinde Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistes teach, from which perfection they fall imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatlie, and must recouer it by masses, and as Bristowe saith, by penance, &amp;c. But Christ by that one sacrifice but once offered, hath made perfect for euer, all those that are sanctified. <hi>That the purpose of the Apostle (in all that Epistle to the Hebrewes) was no more but to exhort the standing to perseuerance,</hi> as Bristowe in so many wordes affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth, let him beleeue, that can thinke, the greatest part of his disputation, for the abolishing of all cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, and sacrifices of the lawe, to be idle and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side his purpose. Likewise that <hi>if they fall, he telleth them that Christes death will not worke in them an other baptisme, but remedie he telleth them none.</hi> Verily there is no remedie, for them that make the death of Christ of none effect vnto themseues, by an vtter and vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersall fall from CHRIST. But it is an horrible slaunder of Gods spirite, that he telleth no remedie by repentance, from particular faulles and daylie offences: when he sheweth the perpetuall clensing of our conscience by the bloode of Christ, Hebrews, 10. verse, 14. and in the 12. Chapter he hath many and earnest exhortations to repentance, verse, 1. and 12. shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the necessitie of Gods fatherly correction to bring vs to repentance, Verses 5. 6. 7. &amp;c. But I shewe great ignorance, where I conclude, that if the greatest parte be left to the sacrifice of the masse, namely to take away all sinnes committed since baptisme, Christ hath not made them that are sanctified perfect for euer by a sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice once offered for all. For Papistes deuide not remission of a mans sinnes betwene baptisme and the masse. No: but you ascribe the whole in such sorte to either of both, that you diuide the powre of making perfect for euer, from the onely once offered sacrifice of
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:13044:160"/>
Christ. But you thinke it is highly for the honor of that one high Priest to haue many ministers, and many ministeries, as it were conduites to deriue his purchase, &amp; his redemption to his people. In deede, if he had not one spirite that were of power to apply the grace of his redemption vnto all his elect, he had neede of many conduites, such as you speake of, for which purpose he vseth not the ministerie of man, but the vertue of the Holie Ghost. The ministerie of man is such as man can execute, that is by the worde, audible and visible, to speake to the eares and eyes of men, and beeing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vp by the holy spirite, to commende the whole effect of his word to the grace of God. But you thinke to auoyde exclamation, if you ascribe nothing to any man, nor any thing, but from that Priest, and from that sacrifice: as though it were lawfull for you to take any thing from the Prieste and sacrifice, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowe it vpon any man or thing, without commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion: yea, against commaundement, and against the excellencie of perfection of that singular Priest and singular sacrifice, which being once offered neede, noe more to be repeated.</p>
               <p>The scriptures thus examined, he commeth to the doctors: And first to Augustine, or rather Fulgentius, <hi>de fide ad Petrum. cap.</hi> 19. cited by me <hi>Pur. 316. &amp;</hi> 292. to proue that the olde doctors, vsinge the name of sacrifice, ment not the popish sacrifice propitiatorie of the naturall bodie and bloode of of Christ, because he calleth it <hi>Sacrificium panis &amp; vini,</hi> the sacrifice of bread and wine. Bristowe replieth, that he also calleth it the the sacrifice of the body &amp; bloode of Christ, wherein as it is cited by him, so is it answered by me, cap. 6. of this booke. Secondly where he saith, <hi>In this sacrifice is thankes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuing &amp; commemoration &amp;c.</hi> Bristow replieth, that he saith also <hi>that in this sacrifice is euide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly shewed, what is giuen for vs, &amp; he is announced alreadie killed.</hi> But because this is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> purpose, he compareth it to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> martyrdomes of <hi>Peter &amp; Paule commemorated vpon their feast at Rome eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently shewed and announced by their verie bodies and heades
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:13044:160"/>
there seene and visited.</hi> A newe way to vnderstand olde doctors, by practise of Idolatrous iugling and faining of reliques. If these Apostles by their bodies be whole at Rome, so many Churches of Peter and Paule as haue presently, or haue had in times past, reliques of their bones, were greatly deceiued. For notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing that Petres whole head is at Rome, his ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther iawe, with his bearde is at Poyters, and many of both their bones at Triers, Saint Paules shoulder at Argentina: yea a peece of Saint Peters braine was at Geneua, where it was tried to be a good pumice stone.</p>
               <p>The second doctor is, <hi>August. de ciui. dei, lib. 22. cap.</hi> 10. saying, the martyrs are that body, which is offered in sacrifice, whereof I conclude, that it is not the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall body of Christ, but his mysticall body, which is offered in a sacrifice of thankesgiuing. Bristowe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swereth, that the mysticall body is offered in the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering of the natu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ll body. But Augustine neuer saith, that the naturall body of Christ is offered, but expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing what body is offered, sheweth that the mysticall bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy is offered. Neuerthelesse Bristowe compareth it to the oblation of Christes naturall body, in offering whereof for his Church, he offered his Church to God with it. But how proueth he y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Christ offered his Church to God for a sacrifice? The sacrifice of himselfe was propitiatorie for the sinnes of his Church, which before he had purged by his sacrifice, he could not offer as a cleane and acceptable sacrifice vnto God.</p>
               <p>The third doctor is, Tertullian, which saith, that prayer is the greatest sacrifice that God hath comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. Bristow saith, <hi>That in the name of that prayer, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehendeth all that is saide and done in the masse, which to this day the priest therfore begineth saying vnto vs after the gospell, Dominus vobiscu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, oremus, let vs pray, &amp; immediatly goeth to the bread and wine &amp;c.</hi> You may thinke I iest: they be the very, words of Bristow and his onely answere. Yea, but there be reasons of this saying: <hi>Because that pure sacrifice is made &amp; celebrated with prayer, as Hierom saith, by the p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>iestes prayers.</hi>
                  <pb n="308" facs="tcp:13044:161"/>
What are then the wordes of consecration? <hi>And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause euen the olde howse of those leuiticall bloode sacrifices also, was Domus orationis, the howse of prayer:</hi> Therefore the masse is nothing but a prayer. So is Tertullian answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. Who would not wonder at this clearkely answere? For I thinke no man can vnderstand of what reason it holdeth.</p>
               <p>The last doctor is Irenaeus saying of the sacrifice of the Church, <q>
                     <hi>Libr. 4. cap. 34.</hi> The conscience of him that doth offer being pure, doth sanctifie the sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, and causeth GOD to accepte it as comming from a frende. The sacrifices doe not sanctifie a man, for GOD hath no neede of sacrifice. &amp;c.</q> This cannot be verified of the naturall body of Christ. Bristowe answereth, they say the same. Yea doe, Bristowe? Is the sacrifice you offer, the bodie of Christ? Yea? doth the conscience of the offerer, sanctifie the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Christ? Out vpon thee filthie blasphemous dogge, if thou dare affirme it. But Bristow asketh <hi>Wether any heretike canpleade by their verdit, that he pleaseth God in offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to him bread and wine?</hi> As though that were the question. <hi>Yea or also the body it selfe and bloode of Christ, so as all Priestes doe in their Caluinicall communion, no lesse then we doe in the masse?</hi> What newes is this? doe all Priestes in the Caluinicall communion, offer the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and blood of Christ as much as you papistes doe in your masse? I thinke euen the same: for none that communicate with Caluine, doe at all offer Christes naturall body and blood, and no more doe you, although arrogantly and blasphemously you pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume to doe it.</p>
               <p>In the 25. demaund of Monkes, where I say the olde Monkes were nothing but Colledges of studentes: Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowe saith, in ouerthtowing of Popish Abbeis, in which was nothing almost but ignorance and filthmes, and I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatrie, we haue spoyled the Church of God, of great vtilitie. But he saith further, they were votaries, and so they be not in colledges of studentes: their vowes were not such that could make them other then students, they
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:13044:161"/>
vowed to serue God vprightly, and his Church, when they were called, and they in Colledges which hauing once promised the same, forsake this holie purpose, haue smale commendation among studentes. I know in time superstition preuailed, and that which first was free, at last became coact: and that which was of conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encie, was thought of necessitie, euen as true religion declined, and in the Romish Church at length dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated into Idolatrie and superstition.</p>
               <p>In the 27. demaund of Councels, where I proue that Councels may erre. First by the prayer vsually saide after the ende of euerie generall Councel: Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowe saith, the prayer is not in respect, for any false de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees or beleeuings of their whole bodies, but by reason of certaine ignorances and frailties of their members: when in the prayer, they expresly declare their feare, lest ignorance hath driuen them into error, which can be vnderstoode of none other common errors of this life, but of their error in decrees, seeing the prayer is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriate vnto the Councel. And that the wordes going before, &amp; after do manifestly declare. <q>
                     <hi>Te in nostris prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipiis &amp;c.</hi> Thee in our beginninges we require an as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sister, thee also in this ende of our iudgementes or decrees, we desire to be present a pardoner for our faultes, that is, that thou wouldest spare our igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and pardon our error: that to our perfect desires, thou wouldest graunt a perfect efficacie of worke. And because our conscience accusing vs, we doe fainte for feare, lest either ignorance hath drawne vs into errror, or rashnes of will perhaps hath driuen vs to decline from iustice; therfore we desire thee, &amp; we pray thee, that if we haue drawne vnto vs, any offence in the celebritie of this Councell, thou wouldest vouchsafe to pardon it, and to make it remissible.</q> Who would pray thus, in the name of the whole Councell, which he thought could not possiblie fall into any error.</p>
               <p>That I alledge out of Augustine, <hi>de baptismo contra Donat. libr. 2. cap. 3.</hi> That generall Councells are and may be reformed, the later by the former: Bristowe vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standeth
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:13044:162"/>
of Councells not confirmed by the Pope, which may be reformed euen by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> see Apostolike alone. That was a poynt more then S. Augustine sawe. But how can they be called <hi>Plenaria concilia</hi> full and whole Councells, where lacketh any necessarie confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? This is a shamelesse eluding of the Doctors sayinges. For first Augustine includeth all catholike Bishops, in possibility of erring in doctrine, not excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Bishop of Rome, then prouinciall, &amp; last of all generall Councells: onely the scripture cannot be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended, as that which hath no error in it.</p>
               <p>Where I saide, the Councells are receiued, because they decreed truly according to the worde of God, and not the truth receiued, because it was decreed in Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cells: Bristowe saith, I might as well say, the scriptures are receiued, because they are written truly: and not the truth receiued because it is written in the scriptures. But I say the comparison is not like: For truth is not so necessarilie bound vnto generall Councells, as it is to the holy scriptures; and therefore both the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are receiued because they are written truly, and the truth is receiued because it is knowne by the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. It followeth not so of councells: that what so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer they haue decreed is truth, although the Bishop of Rome haue confirmed them. Leo Bishop of Rome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed the 6. of Constantinople, which condemned Pope Honorius his predecessor for an heretike, whom you hould cannot erre in doctrine, which is an argument sufficient, to strangle any papist in either of these two blasphemous assertions: The pope ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not erre: The gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Councel confirmed by the Pope, cannot erre.</p>
               <p>In the 28. demaunde, of the See Apostolike, where I bring the example of Victor Bishop of Rome, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoode by Irenaeus and Polycrates, when he went about to vsurpe authoritie ouer other Churches in excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicating all the Churches in Asia, and yet Irenaeus and Polycrates with other so reprouing y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Bishop of Rome, were not heretikes: Bristow babling about the cause of Victors displeasure, which is no matter in question, saith
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:13044:162"/>
he vsurped no authoritie, nor was so charged, but that his censure did seeme to harpe to S. Irenaeus, as if the Pope would nowe excommunicate all them that would not receiue the Councel of Trent, it would seeme likewise to many, who confesse he hath authoritie ouer al. But none of these Bishops, that withstoode Victor, confessed, that he had authoritie ouer them, or that he could not erre. But contrariwise Polycrates chargeth him with vsurpati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, where he saith he will not be troubled with his terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying censure, seeing he followeth (as he thought) the scripture and ancient traditions of the Apostles. Likewise Eusebius saith, that Victor was sharply reproued of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and namely of Irenaeus in the behalfe of all the bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren of Fraunce, whom he gouerned. Yea, he saith ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly, that Victor with his censure was countermanded, by many Bishops: <q>
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. They did countermaund him, or gaue him contrarie commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to set his minde on things pertaining to peace and vnitie, and loue of his neighbour.</q> Irenaeus in his Epistle to Victor shewing, that Polycarpus could not be persua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by Anicetus Bishop of Rome in some small things, wherein they differed, declared, that it was not then of Polycarpus or him selfe otherwise thought, but that the Bishop of Rome might erre.</p>
               <p>The other example, I brought, was of Stephanus Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of Rome, misliked by Dionysius: <hi>Euseb. lib. 7. cap. 2. 3. 4. 5 &amp;c.</hi> &amp; sharply reproued by Cyprian, accusing him of presumption and contumacie, <hi>Epist. ad Pomp.</hi> because he threatened excommunication to Hilenus and Firmilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus, and almost all the Churches of Asia, thinking that such as were baptized by heretikes, should be baptized againe. <q>Also Cyprian in his <hi>Epist. ad Quirinum,</hi> saying that Peter himselfe was not so arrogant, nor so presumptuous, that he would say, he held the primacie, and y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> other men should obey him, as his inferiors:</q> Bristowe saith none of these denied y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> primacie of Peter. I say they al denied the primacie of autoritie, although Cyprian in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same place saith: <q>For neither Peter, whom our lord chose first (which argueth no primacie but of order) vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whom he builded
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:13044:163"/>
his Church, when Paule did afterward dissent from him, about circumcision, did boast him self or take vpon him any thing insolently or arrogantly, that he should say, he held the primacie, and that he ought rather to be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed of newe scholers and aftercommers.</q> Here you see it had bene in Cyprians iudgement, a point of inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie and arrogancie in Peter, if he had challenged the primacie of authoritie, and certaintie of trueth against al men. But Bristowe saith, when there was no remedie, but they must yeeld or be Schismatikes, because Stephanus would no longer tolerate them, they did like Catholike men, for all their Councels, conforme their newe pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise to the old custome, and quoteth <hi>August. de bapt. cont. Donat. lib. 5. cap. 23. &amp;</hi> 25. where there is no such matter, also he referreth vs to his fift Demaund, where he citeth <hi>Euseb. lib. 7. cap.</hi> 2. 3. 4. 5. but neither is it there testified. On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cap. 6. Dionysius chaungeth his iudgement, being ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monished in a vision, and that he had learned that not nowe onely, but of olde time, both in Aphrica and other places, the trueth was receiued, &amp;c. but of any constraint for feare of being Schismatikes, if they dissented from the bishop of Rome, there is no word.</p>
               <p>The place of Hierome <hi>ad Euagrium,</hi> which I cited <hi>Pur.</hi> 374. defending a custome of the whole Church, against a custome of the Church of Rome, Bristowe saith, doth not proue a Church, a rule of trueth, and Christianitie, without the bishop and Church of Rome, because Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome saith, as also there I cite: <hi>Nec altera &amp;c.</hi> we must not thinke, that there is one Church of the citie of Rome, and an other of all the world, &amp;c. By which wordes, he shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that the Church of Rome, if she will be a member of the Catholike Church, must conforme her selfe to the Church of all the world, and not the Church of all the world conforme her selfe to the Church of Rome.</p>
               <p>Where I say, we beleeue the Catholike Church, hath no chiefe gouernour on earth but Christ, vnto whome al power is giuen in heauen and earth: Bristowe obiecteth: suppose, that one Christian King or Emperour should reigne sometime, as farre as the Church reacheth. To this
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:13044:163"/>
impossible supposition, I aunswere, that one King should haue no more authoritie, than euerie King hath nowe. But Bristowe obiecteth, that Kings and Queenes be no more named among S. Paules officers, &amp;c. Ephes. 4. &amp; 1. Cor. 12. and therefore as a Puritane belike, I would pull them downe. In the motiue of Apes, he discharged me from being a Puritane, by his censure; but now he bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deneth me to be a Puritane so farre, that I should also be a traitour, as he and all his fellowes are. To his wise ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection I aunswere, that as Kings and Queenes are not named among Saint Paules officers, so they are no Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticall, but ciuill Magistrates, and the Church may be without them, as it was many hundreth yeares. Yet when Kings and Queenes are Christians, they haue chiefe au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie ouer persons and in causes Ecclesiasticall, as farre as the godlie Kings of Israel and Iuda had, Dauid, Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, Iehosophat, Ezechias, Iosias, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But Christ professing that all power is giuen him, Matthew 28. signifieth that with good authoritie, he might commit what autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie he would, and therefore biddeth all his Apostles goe, teach, and baptize<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> and to one of them singularly, feede my lambes and my sheepe.</hi> No maruel, though my ignorance in the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures be often reproued, when such learned conclusions come from Bristowe. Christ saide to one, feede my lambes and sheepe, therefore he saide it singularly, and he hath vniuersall charge, and all his successors to. <hi>But for the Popes supremacie, the Apostle saith expresly, 1. Cor. 12. the heade (vnder Christ) can not say to the feete, you are not necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie to me.</hi> But who taught you to foyst in your owne glosse, vnder Christ? when the Apostle speaketh of the members of a naturall bodie; wherevnto euerie seueral co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gregation and y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whole church also is like. If you seeke the head of euery seuerall congregation, you must looke to the chiefe gouernours thereof, but if you seeke the head of the whole Church, the scripture teacheth but one, which is Christ, for one head vnder another, in one whole body is monstrous. But you thinke perhaps, Christ as he is head of his Church, may say to the feete, he hath no neede of them, and therefore it must be vnderstoode of
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:13044:164"/>
an head vnder Christ, but then you must remember, that although Christ be most perfect in him selfe, yet as he vouchsafeth to take vpon him this office to be head of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Church, he is not perfect without al his members, which is the singular comfort of Gods children, Ephe. 1. ver. last. But Saint Paule, Ephe. 4. as Bristowe saith, <hi>vnder the name of the Apostles includeth the successors of the Apostle S. Peter, whose see for that cause is called the Apostolike see in singular ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and their decrees and actes esteemed of Apostolike authoritie in al antiquitie.</hi> This cause is a shameles and senseles lie, for no antiquitie, for 600. yeares after Christ so esteemed y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> see, or the decrees therof. Again., what reason is it, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Peters successors should be included, more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the successors of the other Apostles, seeing this souereigntie of Peter, is not grounded vpon his Apostleship, but vpon his Bishoplike office, as Sander maintaineth? As for the principalitie of Apostleship, &amp; principalitie of the Apostles chaire, which he quoteth out of <hi>August. de bapt. Cont. Don. li. 2. ca. 1. &amp; epi.</hi> 162. haue often bene shewed to be vnsufficient, to make euery one of Peters successors equal with Peter in autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, or Peter him selfe superiour to the rest of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles. And consequently there is no cause to thinke, that calamitie of the Greekes to be fallen vpon them for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting from that see.</p>
               <p>In the 29. Demaund of Traditions, where I charge Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistes out of Irenaeus <hi>lib.</hi> 3. 2. to be like to the Valentini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, which accused the scriptures of imperfection, saying, <q>that they are ambiguous, and that the trueth can not be found in them, by such as knewe not the tradition, which was not deliuered by writing, but by worde of mouth, &amp;c.</q> Bristowe answereth, that S. Irenee him selfe, as al Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholikes, will haue both scripture and tradition. Yea sir, but what tradition? any trueth of doctrine, conserued by tradition, which is not contained in the holie scriptures? nothing lesse. But appealeth to the testimonie of the Churches tradition, for confirmation of that which is taught in the scriptures. <q>

vnderstand the Apostolike tradition of the Church, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Epistle is auncienter than they which nowe teach falsely &amp;c.</q> So that what so euer the Apostles deliuered, is contained in their writinges, and it is still an hereti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call assertion to say, that all true doctrine is not deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by writing, but some by word of mouth.</p>
               <p>In the 34. Demaund of Authoritie, where I affirme, the order of the Apostles schoole, is first to heare the word of God preached, and then to beleeue, Rom. 10. re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prouing Allen which commended his friend, that he first beleeued, and afterward sought to vnderstand: Bristowe obiecteth the authoritie of Augustine, <hi>lib Retr. 1. cap.</hi> 14. where he sheweth the cause, whie he did write his booke <hi>de vtilitate credendi</hi> to haue ben, for that the Manichees de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rided the discipline of the Catholike faith, that men were commaunded to beleeue not taught, by most cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine reason, what was true, whose slaunder Augustine confuteth in that booke, and not defendeth Bristowes preposterous order. As for examples of beleeuing Christ and his Apostles, without requiring a reason of their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine; howe vaine it is, I leaue to children to laugh at, seeing I speak not of reason, but of the word of God prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, which must needes goe before faith: Neither doth Augustine meane any otherwise in his booke <hi>de vtil. cred. cap.</hi> 13. <q>where he saith: It is rightly appointed by the maiestie of the Catholike discipline, that faith before all things is persuaded to them which come to religion. </q>But howe should faith be persuaded, but by the preaching of the word of God, without curious inquisition, according to the reason of man?</p>
               <p>Where I say, that Protestants wil be ruled by their su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periors, so far as their superiors are ruled by the word of God: Bristow derideth their authoritie, who by our own confession may swarue from the truth of Gods word: as though the Popish superiors might not, or their supreme head, although beside so many blasphemous errors, as he holdeth, wherof y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> controuersie is with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Papistes, it haue not bene oft proued, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> diuers Popes haue bene condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, euen by generall Councels for heretikes. Where I
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:13044:165"/>
saide the Greeke Church will be ruled by the Patriake of Constantinople, and the orientall Churches by their Patriarkes and Bishops. Bristowe saith, if I knewe the storie of the Florentine Councel, wherein the Patriarkes agreed with the Catholikes Church in all things, and yet could not reduce their countries from schisme, I would not so say. But I knewe that storie before Bristow knewe whether he would become a professed Papist or no. This consent is a forged paper, found in the hande of Ioseph the Patriarke, who died soudenly: but in no acte of that Councel any such submission or agreement in all things, appeareth, but the contrarie.</p>
               <p>Where I saide, that to beleeue the Catholike Church, is not to beleeue all and euery thing which the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Church doth maintaine: Bristowe would haue me suppose, the Apostles had said, <hi>Credo. S. Romanam ecclesiam,</hi> and then asketh, howe I would haue construed it. Verily euen as I conster <hi>Credo ecclesiam Catholicam.</hi> And so would I conster <hi>Credo Sanctas scripturas Canonicas &amp;c.</hi> But if the Apostles would haue taught vs, to giue credite to the Church of Rome in all things, they would haue taught vs to say, <hi>Credo Romanae ecclesiae.</hi> And <hi>Credo scripturis Canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis, duodecim Apostolis, quatuor Euangelistis, &amp;c.</hi> I giue credite to the holy scriptures, to the twelue Apostles, and to the foure Euangelistes. For <hi>Credo</hi> with an Accusatiue case, to signifie I giue credite, howe so euer you deride my grammatication, will not be admitted in the kingdome of Grammarians, except his holinesse will doe as much for that terme, as he is reported to haue done once for <hi>fiatur.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the 35. Demand of Vnitie, where I said, the Church may be called the house of peace, because there is in it peace and agreement in the chiefest articles of faith: Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowe saith, by this reason, many olde heresies were with in the house of peace, because any one article be it of the chiefest or of the meanest, may breake peace, as that of <hi>quartadecimani,</hi> who disagreed onely in the day of Easter but that and such like disagrements in opinion, might be in the house of peace, as Irenaeus testifieth, if obstinate
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:13044:165"/>
contempt of generall order did not make a schisme, and of a schisme an heresie, as in the Donatistes. Otherwise difference in a ceremonie (as I said) maketh not diuision of faith: Bristowe saith, yes, if they holde their ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie necessarie. But then they holde it not as a ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, <hi>or the Churches ceremonie vnlawfull.</hi> But that maketh not diuision. Polycarpus thought his ceremonie to be the right ceremonie, against Anicetus, yet he was not diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from him, for he considered the errour in a ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie not to be of such importance, that it ought to breake the vnitie of the Church. And therefore he refused not to communicate with Anicetus, nor Anicetus with him. No more doe they among vs, that differ in opinion of cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, except some fewe schismaticall heades, that are condemned of all men for their contention and stub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bornesse.</p>
               <p>The difference of opinions betweene the Popish Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uines and Canonistes, Bristowe saith are such, as may be among Christians, as Augustine testifieth, <hi>Cont. Iul. lib 1. cap. 2. de bapt. Cont. Don. lib. 1. cap.</hi> 18. vntil a general Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel allowe some part for cleare and pure, but we will not allowe the authoritie of any generall Councel, if Bristowe may be beleeued: If we might haue a Christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> generall Councel for such matters, as are in controuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie among vs, I doubt not but we should agree, better then the Papistes which boast so much of vnitie. As for the contention of the Popes and Councels superioritie, remaineth still among you, notwithstanding the Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentine Councel, which you say most impudently, that I confesse to haue resolued the matter, when an other Councel, and an other Pope at the same time, determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned against it.</p>
               <p>In the 36. Demand of Owners or Keepers of the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, where I say the primitiue Church, which commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the scripture vnto vs, doth not condemne Luther or his doctrine for heresie: Bristowe saith, it doth in Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius, Iouinian, Vigilantius, &amp;c. as though there were no primitiue Church before these men, which commended the scripture vnto vs, and yet knewe neither praier for
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:13044:166"/>
for the deade, nor superstition of reliques, or any thing that Luther held with those men.</p>
               <p>Where I taxe the blindnesse of the Popish Church, not discerning the scriptures Canonicall, from Apocryphall: Bristowe bringeth in a saying of Augustine, shewing that it is of necessitie, for him to beleeue the Actes of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles, if he beleeue the Gospell: because the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like authoritie commendeth both the scriptures alike vnto him. But I haue shewed, that the Maccabees, Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticus, Iudeth, &amp;c. are not commended to vs by the Catholike or vniuersall authoritie of the Church. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter other contentious pointes stoutly affirmed or denied, without proofe, he commeth to charge me with a sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiall lie, because I say our Church which is the onely true Catholike Church, hath alwaies had right and pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the worde of God, as appeareth by this, that our Church beleueth nothing but that she learneth in them. If this be not a notable plea, Bristowe reporteth him to our Lawiers. But I report me to al Logicians, whether it be not a good argument, by prouing vs to be the true Church, to claime continuall right and possession of the scriptures, as for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> noueltie of Luther, &amp; our co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gregatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, is a weake plea to dispossesse vs of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Church, when y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie of our faith and religion, proueth vs to be of the oldest Church, and therefore the only true Church.</p>
               <p>Where Allen made his offer, that if I could shewe any Church, that hath safely kept the scriptures, sauing the Popish Church, he would recant: I shew him the Greeke and Easterne Churches, which are not Popish, whervpon he is bound by his offer to recant: yet Bristowe without all shame saith: <hi>Euery article of D. Allens is not to proue ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely, that we be the Church; but some only that you be not the Church.</hi> True it is, that neither euery one nor any of them all, are sufficient to proue, that you are the Church and not we. But that Allen meant they were sufficient, it is manifest by that he promiseth to recant, if any of them can be proued to agree to any other, than to the Popish Church.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="319" facs="tcp:13044:166"/>
In the eight and thirtie Demand of old Heresies, where I shewed that many of the Popish ceremonies, were first instituted by heretikes, aunswering directly to Allens challenge, that offered to recant if any man could proue, that any Church but theirs had instituted all their cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies: Bristowe saith they are such matters, as agree none otherwise to them then to those whome I dare not condemne &amp;c. Which if it were so, yet doth it not shewe but that I haue aunswered Allens challenge, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore do, according to his promise, claime his recanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>Of the Messalians or Martyrians I saide, they learned first to shaue their beardes, and let their lockes growe long: Bristowe out of Epiphanius saith, they did let their haire growe long like women The Popish Priestes doe not so, but round them. Yet can he not proue out of Epiphanius, that the Messalians did not keepe their haire in order by rounding or otherwise. Further he saith, some Protestants doe so. I aunswere, none of ceremonie doth so. Thirdly, Priestes in Italie and Spaine doe poll their heads and keepe their beardes. I answere, they keepe the text of the decree, and you the glosse, which saith, <hi>statuimus, id est abrogamus &amp;c.</hi> We decree, that is we abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate that Clearkes neither weare long haire, nor shaue their beardes. Last of all he saith, I haue no great matters to charge them with, when I lay their haires to their charge. My reply is, that my charge goeth no further then Allens challenge, which vrgeth me to shewe any other to haue first instituted any one ceremonie in Poperie, but the Popes only Catholike Church. And so I say to the superstitious masking garmentes, instituted by the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risees, although the auncient Church about foure or fiue hundreth yeares after Christe, receiued such robes in vse.</p>
               <p>Also the daily vse of Popish holie water, to put men in minde of baptisme, had an elder institution of the <hi>Hemerobaptistae</hi> that were baptized or washed euerie day. Here Bristowe with a verie stale iest, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth their fault, and layeth it vpon Saint Paule, who
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:13044:167"/>
hath deceiued them, Rom. 6. where baptisme is in deede remembred, but holie water I trowe is not there. O, then it is 1. Tim 4. where <hi>Saint Paule was to blame</hi> (saith Bristowe) <hi>to tell vs, that the creatures of God are sanctified by the worde of God and by prayer.</hi> Wonderfull Diuinitie, that can bring Popish holie water to so holie a beginning! No maruell if we be blinde, which thinke the Apostle speaketh there of the lawfull vse of meates (forbidden by the Pope) and of all other of Gods creatures being san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified by the worde of God, which giue vs the vse so by praier, that we may vse them well. But specially saith Bristowe, he was to blame for saying. The holy Ghost doth helpe our weaknesse, praying <hi>for vs with groanes vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakeable, how so euer blinde heretikes thinke he will doe nothing by water for praier.</hi> In deede when the scriptures be so plaine for holie water, it is wonder that any be so blinde they can see it.</p>
               <p>Of the Ossenes I saide, they tooke their hallowing of water, salt, oyle, breade, &amp;c. and vse to sweare by them. Bristow asketh if I be an Anabaptist, that will condemne all swearing or swearing by creatures. I aunswere, I will not condemne all swearing, but this customable swea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of Papistes, by this bread, by this salt, &amp;c. and as for swearing by creatures, I am of the same iudgement that our Sauior Christ is, Matth. 5. 34. But Papistes sweare not by them as the Ossenes did, what then? the controuersie is not therein, but of their resemblance with the Ossenes in some part.</p>
               <p>Elxai the father of the Ossenes taught his scholers a praier in a straunge tongue, whose interpretation they might not seeke, whome the Papistes followe in teaching the people to pray in a tongue vnknowne, and will not, (if they may chose) let them knowe the interpretation. Bristowe aunswereth, that Epiphanius saith, <hi>his praier was nothing at all when it was interpreted.</hi> Is it like Epiphanius would say so? Howe could it be interpreted, if it had no signification? Epiphanius in deed sheweth it was a vaine thing, whereof he made so great a mysterie, and your ignorant people of the great mysteries of the Lordes
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:13044:167"/>
prayer, the Salutation and the creede, make vaine and ridiculous matters while they can scarce pronounce their wordes together truly.</p>
               <p>The Marcosians in baptisme vsed for greater ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration certaine Hebrewe wordes; so doe the papistes: Bristowe asketh, whie S. Marke in his greeke writing, vseth y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> word Eppheta? I answere, more liuely to expresse the miracle of Christ: yet doth he it not without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation. Likewise Saint Iohn, in his Apocalipse vseth Amen and Alleluia, wordes, whose signification was as commonly knowne to all Christians, as their owne mother language. What is this to iustifie the vse of that word in baptisme, which neither Marke nor Iohn speake of? <hi>But it was vsed in the time of Ambrose.</hi> So <note place="margin">Ambros. de Sacralib. 1. cap. 1.</note> were other needlesse matters, yet was it vsed to them that vnderstoode the whole office or seruice of baptisme in latine. Augustine saith it was not lawfull for any Barbarian, or Latine man to translate the words, Amen &amp; Alleluia, which al nations do singe in the Psalmes, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his owne language. For thus he coteth <hi>De doct. Chri. lib. 2. cap. 11. &amp; inter Epist.</hi> 174. but in neither of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> do I finde any such matter. Certaine it is that Augustine doth giue the signification of them both in latine. Of the Marci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onistes (I said) they learned to giue wome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> leaue to bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise: Bristow saith, we doe our selues therein by order of our booke as much as they doe, but he is deceiued: there is no permissio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the booke for women to baptise. Touching the necessitie of baptisme, we haue spoken be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cap. 6. Finallie I saide the Papistes are Pelagians for holding free will, and merites of workes, as they did, &amp; not predessination and grace as S. Augustine did, Bristow citeth <hi>Hierom. Cont. Pela</hi> saying, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it was the heresie of the Manichees, to take away free will. So it was in deede to affirme that the wil of man was inforced or constreined. But that the will of man, is free from the thraldome of sinne, and hath power to merite, without grace, or with grace more easily, it was the heresie of the Pelagians as Augustine in whole bookes written against the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> doth declare: But <hi>August. Epist.</hi> 46. saith, That by the grace of

God a wicked man may be made a iust one, and so may begin to haue good merites, which God shal crown whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the world shal be iudged.

By this it may be inferred, that God yeeldeth not to the merites of Christ, so much as they deserue, because the merites of many men doe hinder, as though y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> merites of al men do not deserue da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

foolish sophistrie riseth by reasoning from possibilitie of Christes worthynesse, to the acte of mens worthynesse.

               <p>In the three and fourtie Demand of succession, where I saide, there is no such succession of persons and places, promised, as the Papistes boast of: Bristowe saith, the saying of the Apostle, Ephes. 4. promiseth a continuance of Pastors and Doctors vnto the end: which I confesse, but yet is not the orderly succession of persons and pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces thereby proued, there shall alway be Pastors and tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers in the Church, but it followeth not, that they shall continue in succession of the same roomes, in the same places, as the Papistes boast of the succession of Popes. That he defendeth the offices of Apostles, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetes and Euangelistes, to continue alwayes in the Church by succession, being a grosse error, I will not stand to confute, because it is none of the principall mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in controuersie.</p>
               <p>Where I saide, that if succession of persons and places were sufficient, the Greeke Church is able to name as many, as the Latine Church, and in as orderly succession, Ar. 27.

We may by as good right as you claime succession to the Apostles, and godly Bishop of Rome, whome you succeede not in doctrine. For neither haue you any right succession, but from them that began your heresies and separation from the Christian Church, Boniface the third and his fellowes. But Gregorie saith, the Church of Constantinople is subiect to the Church of Rome. But so doth not the Councels of Constantinople, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Gregories time decreed, that the Church of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople should be equall in all thinges with the Church of Rome, the title of senioritie onely reserued: because Constantinople was newe Rome. <hi>Socr. li. 5. cap. 8.

               <p>In the 44.

               <p>In the 45 Demaund of chaunging, where I cite the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistle of Hulderichus Bishop of Auspurge, witnessing that Gregorie was y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> first that compelled Priestes to liue vnmarried: Bristowe answereth, that <hi>seeing I confesst, that he reuoked his error, he made no change fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his fathers faith:</hi> Yes sir, although he reuoked his decree, yet was the same re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued by them that came after him.

               <p>Where I tell them, that Sabinianus condemned the decrees of his predecessor Gregorie, and Stephanus of Formosus: Bristowe saith, not one Pope, hath condemned any decrees made of doctrine. It were hard for him to proue, that none of those Popes, all whose actes their suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors disanulled, made any decrees of doctrine. And certaine it is, that Gregorie made decrees of doctrine, or else the Popes Canon lawe doth lie, al whose decrees, yea and bookes also, as containing heresie, his successor Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binianus condemned and burned. <hi>But supposing</hi> (saith he) <hi>that Pope Honorius was a Monothelite, both in opinion and in some secrete writing, yet did he not change, nor go about to change the Romanes into Monothelites.</hi> What meant he then to write hereticall Epistles, but to drawe other into his he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resie?

To this I must needes say, that Bristowe is either an ignorant reporter, or an impudent lier, except

he will say that Caluine or some of vs wrote, the report of the Councel of Constance, where he was accused and conuicted by witnesse, to haue denied the mortalitie of the soule, and the resurrection of the body, and life e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlasting, Session. II. And in the next Session he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed, that the Councel of Constance was most holie, and could not erre. As for the assertion of Pope Ioane the feminine Pope, I referre the reader to Maister Iew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els replie to Harding, where he proueth it, by auncien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>testes,</hi> than Martinus Polonus, howe so euer Bristowe sawe it in a marginall note, I wot not where, not in what Protestantes hand, as he reporteth.</p>
               <p>In the sixe and fourtie Demaund of our auncetors saued or damned, he maruelleth where my wit was, when I alledged against Canonization, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> example of burning Hermannus the heretike in Ferraria, where he was wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped twentie yeares Apocryphally. But if he had not bene canonized as you say, where was the Popes care of the Church, that so neare him in Italie, he would suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer such grosse idolatrie, so long time to be committed and continued? Wherefore except you bring better prose for your negatiue the affirmatiue that he was canonized, which so long had bene worshipped, without contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction is more probable, seeing you hold that the Romish Church can not suffer any vngodly vsage, so long to be vncontrolled.</p>
               <p>Where I saide, the Papistes can not proue, that the Pope and Popish Church hath canonized the Apostles &amp; principall Martyrs: Bristowe asketh, if making of holie daies, and to name them in diptychis among Saintes, in the holy Canon of the Masse is not proofe sufficient, of their canonization. No sir, if that be canonization, which your late Canons and practise doth allowe: but if it were, I say, the Apostles and principal Martyrs had daies of remembrance of their godly life, and doctrine, names in the tables, and at the celebration of the Lordes supper, before canonization was thought to pertaine onely to the Pope.

dayes, doth not disproue our Communion with the Saintes, which is in consent of their faith, not in celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of their feastes. Concerning the canonization of King Henrie the sixt: Bristowe requireth mine authour for a dilatorie plea, because he can not otherwise defend the Popish corruption. Mine authour is Edward Hall in his Chronicles of Henrie the seuenth, where I said we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge those to be Saintes, whose names are written in the booke of life. Bristowe like a blacke dogge scof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feth at it, and saith, we might doe well to set out that booke in print, that they might correct their Calender by it. Or else the Churches declaration is the most cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine way to knowe who are written in it. If none should be written, but such as the Pope doth canonize (for that is your Churches declaration) innumerable Papistes, should haue no place therein, and not onely Papistes, but the true Saintes of God, of whome not one among tenne thousand, hath bene canonized. Where I say, the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish Church doth iniurie to the Saintes of God, that she doth not so account them while they liue: Bristowe saith I would be called Saint Fulke, by mine owne industrie, and that out of hande. Thus hath he no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Heathenish scornes, to delude the textes of Scripture, which I cited, to proue that the Church of GOD counteth all true Christians Saintes, euen in this life, not by their owne industrie and merites, but by the sanctification of the bloud of Christ.</p>
               <p>He is angrie that I compare the Popes canoniza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions with the Heathen Senates canonizing of their Goddes, saying, wee doe the like in canonizing our selues, because wee account our selues Saintes, and true Christians, which is all one, and because I shewe, the emulation of the Bohemians, in solemnizing the memories of Iohn Hus and Hierome of Prage, which differeth as much from Popish canonization, as their faith and religion differeth from Poperie.</p>
               <p>In y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 47. Demand of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion of Saints, he boasteth of increase of Papists in England, affirming, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>

<pb n="332" facs="tcp:13044:174"/>
are Catholike in heart and of their communion, there be innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable of them reconciled,</hi> which he saith, to prepare the minds of his friendes vnto their intended massacre and rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. I suppose in deede, there are too many of those dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembling and professed traitors: but yet not so many, but they may be numbred. But howe many so euer they are, I doubt not, but there are Christians of such number and power in England, as are able to giue all the Papistes both on this side the sea, and beyond it, as blacke a day as the Popes armie found in Ireland, if euer they attempt to put in practise their long intended and certainly pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed treasonable deuises.</p>
               <p>In the 48. Demaund, where I shewe the fruites of the Gospell, being vrged thereto by Allen, Pur. 241. to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare notably in the liberall prouision for the poore of all sorts in England, and namely in the citie of London: Bristowe calleth it beastly impudencie: yet is he not able to name any Popish citie, that maketh such prouision; but falleth into open railing, vpon the corrupt manners of all the citie, as though for the fault of many, (which yet Gods name be praised, are not the most) the whole citie were not inferior to Sodome and Gomorrhe in wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednesse: In which place as being very populous, there are many offenders, so are they punished if their offences may be knowne. But who so knewe London in the time of Poperie, and nowe also considereth the manners of the multitude, must be a very vnequall iudge, if he acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge not great reformation in a great number, though he can not see it all. As for the citie of Rome, which Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowe compareth with Solomon, whose Priestes were more excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t than the report that went of him: as by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> storie and relation of them which knewe it before this time, so by report of some which euen in this time haue visited the same, we haue sufficient vnderstanding, that without great reformation, it still continueth the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of all abhominations of the earth, and reaching forth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cup of poisoned wine, vnto such as seeke her who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish familiaritie, maketh them therewith so drunke, that there is no cause why Bristowe should maruell why no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:13044:174"/>
confirmeth more our countrimen in Poperie, nor alienateth them from the Protestants, than to goe and see Rome.</p>

But when they are considered according to the circumstance of the place, in which they are written, I hope there are not many of so meane iudgement, but they will acknowledge, they are rather the cauils of Bristowe, than the contradictions of Fulke.</p>
               <p>The first Contradiction he noteth, that I say, Art 96. <hi>You are neuer able to aunswere the arguments that Peter was neuer at Rome. And the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> where is the Apostolike see? &amp;c. And the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> on the conirarie side: the Church of Rome was founded by the Apostles, it was an Apostolike Church.</hi> For this he quoteth Purg. 361. 363. 374. To this I aunswere: In the first part he falsifieth my wordes, which are these: You are neuer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to answere the arguments, that are brought to proue that Peter was neuer Bishop at Rome, and then where is all your bragges of Apostolike see and succession? &amp;c. The Church of Rome might bee an Apostolike see, though Peter was neuer there: but all your bragges of Apostolike see, and succession are vaine, if Peter was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer Bishop of Rome.</p>
               <p>The second: <hi>Those auncient Fathers did appeale to the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Church of Rome against all heresies, and among the
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:13044:175"/>
Catholike Churches, especially named the Church of Rome, because it continued in the doctrine of the Apostles,</hi> Pur. 373. 374. <hi>Contrat And by the way note here the bragge of the Romane faith</hi> Pur. 405. The former proposition is not mine, but patched by him, yet if I graunt the sense and wordes to be, as he hath forged them, they are not contradictorie to the latter proposition. For heretikes may bragge of that which Catholikes vse to doe: and yet not be Catholikes.</p>
               <p>The thirde: <hi>It had by succession (speaking of the Church of R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                     </gap>) retained euen vntill their dayes, that faith which it did first receiue of the Apostles.</hi> Pur. 374. <hi>Contra: She the Church of Rome hath had no orderly succession of Bishoppes, except so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny schismes as they write of, be orderly successions.</hi> By the time of these Fathers (saith Bristowe) there had bene foure schismes. Ar. 85. Aunswere. In the first proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion I speake of Tertullians time and succession of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, and name succession simplie. In the second pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position I speake of the whole time vntill our dayes, and of succession of persons, and of orderly succession: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no contradiction.</p>
               <p>The fourth: <hi>It continued at that time in the doctrine of the Apostles, it retained by succession that faith which it did first receiue of the Apostles.</hi> Pur. 373. 374. <hi>Contra: he chargeth it with sundrie errors here cap. 3. &amp; 4 namely P. Liberius with A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rianisme. P. Innocentius for housling of Insantes, and eight Popes for the supremacie.</hi> I might aunswere, that the charging of the Popes, chargeth not the Church. but in the first proposition, I spake of the Church of Rome, in the time of Irenaeus, and Tertullian, holding the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Apostles, contrarie to those heresies against which they write.</p>
               <p>The fift: <hi>It was a true Church, and Apostolike Church, a faithfull Church, true and Apostolike faith and religion haue dwelled in her.</hi> Pur. 374. <hi>Ar. 79. Contra: The Church of Rome neuer preached the trueth. She neuer had since she first arose the ministring of sacraments according to Christes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution. The true Catholike Church hath ouerthrowen he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resies of all sortes. But the Popish Church was neuer able to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter with heretikes. Rome may be a nurse of Antichristi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

but neuer did good to Christians. I am able to proue that the primitiue Church affirmed your Church to be the Church of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ.</hi> Ar. 85. 16. 106. 10. 27.</p>
               <p>The latter part of this contradiction, with as many falsifications as there be quotations, doe sufficiently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, that in all those places, I speake of the Popishe Church of Rome that nowe is, and not of the true Church which of olde time was at Rome. Yet to giue the reader a taste of his falsification of my wordes Ar. 106. which hee rehearseth thus. Rome may be a nurse, &amp;c. in truth they are these: Rome which feedeth her babes with poison of mans traditions, in steade of the milke of Gods worde, and will rather see them famish than they should taste of Gods worde, may well bee a nurse of Antichristians, but neuer did good vnto Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians.</p>
               <p>The sixt: <hi>The Popish Church is a puddle of all false doctrine and heresie, whereof the whore beareth a cuppe full, out of which all nations haue dronke.</hi> Ar. 102. 38. <hi>Euen from the Apostles <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

For it hath bene often saide, the Greeke Church and (all) other Orientall Churches (of Assa and Africa) neuer receiued the Popish religion, in many chiefe points, and specially in acknowledging the Popes authoritie, they will not vnto this day acknowledge her doctrine to be Catholike, nor her authoritie to be lawfull.</hi> Ar. 38. 16 33. 34.</p>
               <p>These places being both full of falsifications, yet if they had bene in so many wordes set downe by me, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy no contradiction. For it may be, that all n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>tions, (meaning as the scripture, whose wordes I cite Apoc. 18. not all of euerie nation, but some of all nations) haue dronke of the whores cup, and yet neuer receiued her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion in al things. And the general defection is meant of that great apostasie that S. Paul speaketh of, in which the greatest number shall fall from Christ, though they
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:13044:176"/>
fall not all to the Pope. For many are fallen to Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met, many reuolted to idolatrie, many to other heresies beside Poperie.</p>
               <p>The 7. <hi>The religion of Papistes came in, and preuailed in the yere of our Lord 607. in which the Pope first obtained his Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> exaltatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to wit, Boniface</hi> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
                  <hi>third of Phocas the Emperor, that the Bishop of Rome should be called and counted the heade of all the Church.</hi> Ar. 36. <hi>Contra in the same place: Because you speak of the first entring of Popish religion, which dependeth chiefly vpon the Popes authoritie: it first beganne to aduaunce it selfe in Victor, about the yeare of our Lord</hi> 200. What contradiction is here? Popish religion in one piece first beganne to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunce it selfe Anno 200. and after came in and preuai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, Anno 607.</p>
               <p>The 8. <hi>The Popish Church is a puddle of all false doctrine and heresie. Euen in the Apostles time, and from that time, in all times, when so euer, and where so euer was any piece of myste or darke corner, there were the steppes of your walke. It may be a shame for you Papistes, to leaue and condemne for heresie, all that is true in the Fathers writings, and agreeable to the scriptures.</hi> Ar. 102. Pur. 287. 238. <hi>Contra: Where he dictinguisheth the religion of the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistes, from the great heresies, and open aduersaries, that sought to beate downe the chiefe foundations of Christian faith, as the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentinians, Marcionistes, Manichees, Arrians, Sabellians, and such like monsters.</hi> Ar. 43. He falsifieth my distinction, which is not of the religion of the Papistes, but of the first begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of such errors in the time of the auncient Fathers, which among the Papistes are growne to be in manner as great as the monsters of Valentinians, Marcionistes, &amp;c. And yet there can be no contradiction, where the subiectes of both propositions are not all one. But here the one is of the Popish Church (which is a member of the malignant congregation of Satan) the other is of the religion of Papistes. The Papistes by communion of the diuels Church, communicate with all heresies.</p>
               <p>The 9. <hi>We say not that the religion of Papistes came in sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly, but that it entred by small degrees at the first: and therefore <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when a generall defection, and departing from the faith was foreshewed, what marueile were it, if none colde preach a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst it as it first entred?</hi> Ar. 43. 36. 38. <hi>Contra: The Church of Christ in such places as she is, suffereth no man damnablie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>busing her religion, without open reprehension.</hi> Ar. 92. 36. 37. The former proposition hath manifest forgeries, as that I should say, The religion of papistes was not preached against &amp;c. Winked at &amp;c. Allowed of Augustine &amp;c. For I neuer said so of the whole religion of papists, but of some fewe errors budding vp in antient times. But both Ar. 36. where I aske What maruaile &amp;c. as an obiection, I doe neuerthelesse shewe who preached a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the vsurpation of the Bishop of Rome, which yet tended not to a damnable error; &amp; Ar. 38.

               <p>The first proposition is an Ironicall imitation of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lens absurd proposition, and not an absolute assertion of mine.</p>

               <p>The former proposition, is the conclusion which I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tort vpon Allens principle, that whosoeuer by true chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians are called heretikes, do proue so in deede.</p>
               <p n="38">38 <hi>There is neuer heresie, but there is as great doubt of the church, as of the matter in question.</hi> Ar. 86. <hi>Contra: Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stines argument of the publike prayers of the church, tooke no hold of the Pelagians by force of trueth that is in it, but by their owne confession and graunt, of that prayer to be godly, and them to be of the church that so prayed. But now the controuersie is not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the substance of doctrine, but of the church it selfe also. The Donatistes challenged the church to themselues.</hi> Pur. 367.</p>
               <p>Here is not so much as any shadowe of contradiction, for in the heresie of the Donatists, the chiefest contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersy was of the Church: as for the prayer of the Church, they vsed it themselues as well as the true Catholikes, out of which prayer Augustine gathereth an argument against them.</p>
               <p n="39">39 <hi>But for the chiefe pointes of christian religion, and the foundation of our faith, that is, Reall presence, &amp;c. the most ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued writers are vtterly against you, and therefore can not be of your church. Contra: But the Lutheranes and Zuinglians (as it pleaseth you to call them) are of one true church, although they differ in one opinion concerning the Sacrament, the one assirming a Reall presence, the other denying it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The contradiction is easily auoided, by shewing, that the reall presence among a number of thinges in that place rehearsed, may be one chiefe point of religion, and yet not a foundation of our faith. For I say the auncient fathers agree with vs in the chiefe points of religion, and the foundation of our faith, which seeing the Lutherans
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:13044:182"/>
hold with vs, the dissent in one chiefe point of religion, can not disseuer them from the Church, and yet they di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ssent not vnto idolatrie, as the Papists doe. And where Bristow slandereth mee to say, that I count the errors of some of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> latter sort of old fathers (in honoring reliques inuocation of Saints, merits, traditions, vnwritten veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, images of the crosse) to be contrary to the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he is able to shewe no place where I so affirme. And albeit they did so earnestly maintaine some of those er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, that they condemned by their priuate sensure, the contrary truth, for heresies: yet it followeth not that they were heretikes. For it is one thing to hold an error earnestly, an other to holde it obstinatly, so that he is condemned of his owne conscience, when he will not yeeld to the manifest truth plamly proued out of the worde of God.</p>
               <p n="40">40 <hi>We knowe that Luther did not obstinately and malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously erre in any article of faith, concerning the substance of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. Luther, Caluine, and Bucer, shall come with Christ to iudge the world. As for Illyrians, if you call them of Flaccius Illyricus, they be Lutherans in opinion of the Sacrament, and differ onely in ceremonies, which can not diuide them from the faith.</hi> Ar. 10. 61. Pur. 403. <hi>Contra: What Flaccius, or any such as he is, hath saide, neither doe I knowe, neither doe I regard, let them aunswere for them selues: But whereas you charge M. Caluine, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Because I knowe not how Illyricus, and such conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious persons as he, expoundeth the annointing in Saint Iames, but referre them to aunswere for them selues, therefore I speake contrary to my selfe, where I say they differ not in faith, from the Lutherans.</p>

               <p>It seemeth Bristowe is beside himselfe, in coyning of contradictions. These words, The Church is the stay of
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:13044:183"/>
truth, for which he quoteth Pur. 367. are not mine in that place, but his owne addition: although in other sense I confesse the Church is the stay and piller of truth, not that all is true which is alwaies in the Church, but that truth can not be preserued on earth by the Church.</p>
               <p n="42">42 Among the arguments that Augustine vseth against the Pelagians, one (though the feeblest of an hundred) is, that their heresie was contrarie to the publique praiers of the church. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra: All other persuasions set aside, hee prouoketh onely to the Scripture, to trie the faith and doctrine of the church, namely in beating downe the schisme of the Donaistes, and the heresie of the Pelagians. Where also he contradicteth him selfe againe, in shewing the reason whie he argued against the Donatistes of on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scripture, but against the Pelagians of the churches praiers also: The Pelagians graunted them to be of the church that so praied. And therefore when Augustine had to doe with the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natistes that challenged the church vnto them selues, he setteth all other trials aside, and prouoketh onely to the Scriptures.</p>
               <p>Let the readers iudge: for I can not imagine where there be should be so much as the shadowe of a contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, gathered out of these wordes, except he meane, that he which prouoketh onely to the scriptures, may not vse an hundreth argumentes out of them, yea or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny persuasions beside the scriptures, and yet stand onely vpon the auctority of the scriptures.</p>

The first proposition (as in the place quoted is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest) is spoken of questions of doctrine: and not of our persuasion of the scriptures to be the word of God. The last sentence, You should bring, &amp;c. being patched out of two places of my booke, Pur. 364. and 331. are not contradictory to the first proposition: for although we stand for auctority onely to iudgement of the holy scriptures, yet we are content to giue you this aduantage against vs, if you can bring any thing out of those eldest writers for Purgatory or prayer for the dead.</p>

               <p>It were a strange contradiction, that could bee pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked out of these two allegories, laying the foundation, and rifely budding; seeing the foundation is the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of a building, and budding is the first towardnesse of fruite As for the pedigree, is not to the last generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as Bristow saith, layed in Saint Augustines time, but from the first auctor howe it was continued vnto Saint Augustines time, since which there haue beene many dissents before popish Purgatory were throughly shaped and brought forth.</p>

As Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine Luther and Illyricus, for I am persuaded that they are more curious than wise in so doing.</p>
               <p>My words be not alledged truely, in neither of both propositions. In the former they are these, I will not gainesay, but whoso denieth, &amp;c. I doe not alwaies af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme, that I will not gainesay. I may be in doubt.

Shall other mens account be ioyned to mine affirmation, to charge me with contradiction? Againe, the former pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position, Who so denieth, &amp;c.

a godly life, but will not be reduced to the perfection thereof by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, or satisfaction of his lothsome life past.</hi> The very words of Allen be these: This our aduersarie, Math. 5. here signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth our brother, which hath iust quarell against vs in iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we would not giue eare vnto him sharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly admonishing vs of our faults, being therefore an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersary to our vices and fleshly conuersation.

To this kinde of aduersary Christ counselleth and commandeth vs, for our great good, to agree and consent whiles we be here in the way of this our pilgrimage and transito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie life, least all these meanes which he wrought to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce vs, to the perfection of a Christian godly life, be as it were, a witnesse of our contempt, and him selfe our accuser before the Iudge, that shall so iustly reward eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie man according to his deedes: that is Christe him selfe, to whome the father hath giuen all iudgement.</p>
               <p>Nowe the wordes in which I reproue this absurdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of Allen, are these. But before we goe any further, let vs see howe the doctrine of this chapter agreeth with y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we had in the chapter next before. There we were told, that Purgatorie serueth but for veniall sinnes, or else for such mortall sinnes, as by forgiuenesse in this life obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, are made veniall trespasses. But here not onely vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and fleshly conuersation, but also contempt of all that preach Christ, and repentance of our lothsome life past, &amp;c. are saide to be the debt that must be discharged in Purgatorie to the vttermost farthing, then the which no vice is more mortall, nor further from forgiuenesse. For he that not onely leadeth a lothsome life, but also contemneth all those meanes that Christ hath wrought, to reduce him to the perfection of a Christian godly life; (I vse his owne wordes) howe can he haue remission of his sinnes in this life? and yet Maister Allen dare promise

               </argument>
               <p>The first flower is that I say, Pur. 283. the sacrifice <note place="margin">Fulke.</note> propitiatorie was offered in the lawe onely by the high Priest, once in the yeare. But Bristowe saith, that sacrifice propitiatorie, and for sinne are all one: which sacrifice for sinne was offered, not onely once in the yeare, in the seast of expiation, but also in many other feast dayes, ordinarily and extraordinarily; when so euer any occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was ministred &amp;c. I knowe not whether I should here accuse his ignorance, or his malice. Which confoundeth that singular sacrifice propitiatorie (vnto which the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle compareth the sacrifice of Christes death, Heb. 9) with the often and vsuall sacrifices for sinne, saying they are all one. When that one aboue all the rest is described with such solemnitie, that the high Priest that day onely entreth into the holiest place, that he may offer that <hi>holo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caustum</hi> or the burnt offering, &amp;c. And that it should be an euerlasting ordinance to make an attonement for the children of Israel, for all their sinnes once a yeare. Leuit. 16. Wherefore the other sacrifices for sinne had their ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of that shadowie or sacramentall propitiation, of this principall sacrifice, which was the most liuely paterne or example of the onely true sacrifice propitiatorie, which our Sauiour Christ offered on y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> crosse; once for al: which proportion is obserued by the Apostle, Heb 9. ver. 6. 7. 8. 9. 10.. &amp;c. &amp; Heb. 10. ver 11. &amp; 12. But where Bristow saith, beside this one propitiatorie sacrifice, Fulke findeth none, but sacrifices of thankesgiuing in the lawe, he affirmeth that which was neither said of me, nor is truely collected of him. For I saide, that Cyprian in these termes, sacrifice, priest, altar, alludeth to the sacrifices of thankesgiuing
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:13044:186"/>

                  </gap> in the lawe.</p>

                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap>aeus, I say that both the high Priest at that time was a wicked and vngodly man, to wit, either Iason, Menelaus, or Alcimus, and namely Menelaus, the worst of them all three: and also that the other Priestes of that time, were giuen to the practises of the Gentiles, 2. Machab. 4. In so much, that it is like that Iudas Machabaeus, if hee deuised not the sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of his owne heade, yet tooke by imitation of the Gentiles. Frst hee maruelleth, howe I could thinke that Machabaeus had any commnion with the Gentilizers, against whom all his fighting was, seeing it is written first of Macab 4 that he chose priestes without spot, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing their heart in the lawe of God. I aunswere be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing such as they were described. 2. Machab. 4. hee had hard choise to finde a sufficient number of vnspotted priestes. But although he were an enimy of gentility, in that corrupt time and state, he might be drawen into i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation of the gentiles in some point that had a shewe of pietie, although it were not agreeable to the lawe of God.</p>
               <p>His next accusation is, that I call them high priestes which were but antipontifices and vsurpers. I aunswere, I iustifie not their title, more then their maners and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, but whereas by his greekelatine word, he suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth that there were other true high priestes in their time, he bewraieth his owne grosse ignorance. For whereas he saith that the succession of the true high priestes for that time was this: Onias, Mathathias, Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das. Ionathas, Simon: The truth is, that Mathathias and Iudas were neuer high priestes, neither doth the Story 1. Macc. 2. or 1. Macc. 3 which he quoteth, shewe any thing to proue that they were: It sayeth that Mathathias was a priest, but not that he was the high priest. And Iose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus who did write an history of the Maccabees, testifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:13044:186"/>
plainly that from Iacimus to Ionathan, for 7. yeares there was no high priest, which Ionathan was made high priest in the yeare 160. <hi>Ioseph. Antiqu. Lib. 20. Cap.</hi> 8. 1. Maccab. Cap. 10. verse 21. which was many yeares after Iudas his brother was slaine. Therefore at such time as Iudas should send the offering to Hierusalem, there was no such good Bishop, as Allen saith: but euen Onias cognomento Menelaus, as Iosephus calleth him, which was depriued both of his life and of his high priesthood at Berytus or as the corrupt story of the Machabes saith, at Berea. 2. Macc. 13. called in the first of the Machabees Bethzetha. But whereas Bristow maketh Ionathas or Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon chiefe priestes in the absence of Iudas, and not Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelaus, he forgetteth that in those expeditions which Iudas made from Hierusalem, for which he quoteth 1. Macc. 4. 5. it is plaine in the same chapter, that Simon was sent with an hoast into Galilee, and Ionathan went with his brother Iudas ouer Iordane into Gilead: which story, how he wil reconcile with the 2. Mac 12. either for time or persons, I haue great meruaile. But that Mene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laus, as he was then in office of the high priest, though vnworthy, so that he was at Hierusalem, it appeareth by this record of the time. The Temple was purged (as Bristowe confesseth,) and it is written 1. Macc. 4. <hi>Anno</hi> 148. in the 25. of the Moneth Cislewe, and in the same yeare Antiochus Eupator by letters sent to Lysias com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth that the Temple should be restored to the Iewes, whereof Lysias writeth to the Iewes the 24. of the moneth of Iupiter, Corinthus and king Antiochus him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, with letters bearing date the 15. of the moneth Panticus sendeth Menelaus to comfort the Iewes. 5. Mac. 11. And y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> next yeare after <hi>Anno</hi> 149. Antiochus came into Iewrie, and did execution vpon Menelaus, and made warre vpon Iudas, &amp;c. 2. Macc. 13. and ordained Iacimus high priest, which continued in that place 3. yeares. <hi>Iosep. Antiqu. Lib. 20. cap.</hi> 8. If that this account of the second booke of Maccabees, agree not with the story of the first booke, as in deede it doth not, let Bristowe looke <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>to it, that defendeth these bookes to be Canonicall:
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:13044:187"/>
it is sufficient for me to iustifie that I cited out of this latter booke, by the report of the same booke: and by Iosephus, who knewe the succession of the high Priestes of his nation, better than Bristowe, whose arrogant ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance is so much the more odious, that hee would charge me with ouersight, in that hee is most ignorant him selfe: and that against his Maister Allen, who sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth some other to be high Priest or Bishop, and not Iudas him selfe.</p>
               <p>The third chapter, of my grosse or rather malicious ignorance, is saide to be about Antichrist: As that the Church of Christ should prepare his way, or worke his mysterie. But this is a fable of Bristowe, neuer affirmed by me. As for the other assertions of the time of his reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, of the Churches fleeing into the wildernesse, of the time of Antichristes reigne, &amp;c. because they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by the onely authoritie of Bristowe, without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny argument or testimonie of Scripture, or Fathers, I will referre the reader to such places, where I affirme any of them, to consider my reasons, and to iudge indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferently.</p>
               <p>The fourth point is, <hi>that the body of Christ is not offered to him selfe, but thankesgiuing is offered to him for the offering of his body for vs.</hi> Pur. 316. Against this, his reasons are these. <hi>Why sir, did not he vpon the crosse offer his owne body as a Man, and a Priest to him selfe as to God?</hi> Sir, the Scripture telleth me, that Christ being an high Priest, by his eternall spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite, offered him selfe vnreproueable to GOD: Hebr. 9. verse 14. <hi>Ergo,</hi> you will say to him selfe as God, because the persons of the godhead are vndiuided. Yet I trust you will distinguish y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> humanitie from the deitie, &amp; so Christ offered not his body to him selfe, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is, neither to his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manitie, nor to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> person of the mediatour, which is God and man. For though God was made man, yet God the Father was not made man, nor God the holy Ghost, but God the Sonne onely. And although it were graunted, that Christ offering him selfe to God, was offered to him selfe, yet it followeth not that men of whome I spake, can offer the body of Christ, yea whole Christ to him selfe,
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:13044:187"/>
then the which nothing is more absurd. An other reason Bristow bringeth: <hi>that I noted others for saying, it is not lawful to pray to God the sonne.</hi> As though it were al one to pray to Christ, &amp; to offer his body to Christ, him self to him self. The fift: <hi>That I call it a vaine amplification and fond suppositio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to extend the force of Christes death beyond the limits of his will.</hi> My words are of Allens supposition, that the ful force of Christs death would sup vp al sinne &amp; al paine for sinne, death temporall, and eternall, hell, purgatorie, and all paine, &amp;c. But what reasons hath Bristow against my say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? First: my assertion is (saith he) <hi>As though it were not of force to worke any whit more than it worketh in acte, as to saue so much as one of them that shal not be saued.</hi> I say, it is of force to worke euen as much as God will, but not to worke a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the will of God. But I speake contrarie to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse scripture. <hi>He is the propitiation for our sinnes, and not for our sinnes only, but also for the sinnes of the whole world. 1. Ioh.</hi> 2. If you vnderstand the whole world, for euery man in the world, then it foloweth, that God is reconciled for al men, &amp; so no man shall be damned. But S. Iohn meaneth by his general word, al the elect of the world: as when he saith, The whole world is set on mischiefe; he meaneth not euery person, but all the reprobate 1. Ioh. 5. And that Christes death is not a propitiation of the sinnes of al the wicked of the world and reprobates, it is certaine, by that he refuseth to pray for the world, that is, for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probates of the world, Iohn 17.</p>
               <p>But Bristowe vrgeth me with mine owne saying, in an other contrarie to this. <hi>Concerning the sufficiencie of Christes redemption, there is nothing that can be spoken so magnifically, but that the worthinesse thereof passeth and excelleth it.</hi> This should haue come in among the contradictions, if Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowe had remembred it. But I beseech you sir, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending the sufficiencie of Christes redemption, doe I extend the force of his death beyond the limits of his will? Are any more redeemed than Christ would?</p>
               <p>The sixt: I say, that to remit sinnes, is proper to his diuinitie. That is (saith Bristowe) <hi>as though Christ doth not remit sinnes, according to his humanitie.</hi>
                  <pb n="360" facs="tcp:13044:188"/>
I say Christ which is a person consisting of God and man, doth remitte sinnes by absolute auctority, but that is proper to his diuinity and not to his humanity, as for the power which he hath giuen to his ministers, to remit sinne, is not absolute, but to declare remission of sinnes in his name. Neither did the people which glorified God for giuing such power to men Matth. 9. acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the doctrine of the Church for the remission of sinnes by the ministery of man, but praised God for gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the gift of healing vnto Christ, whom yet as young scholers, they acknowledge not to be God, but an holy Prophet sent of God. And so the other Euangelists report their praising of God to haue beene for that they neuer sawe it so: they had seene wonderfull things that day. Mark. 2. Luk. 5.</p>
               <p>The 7. he chargeth me to teach a pestilent doctrine of desperation, Where I say, there be sinnes for which the Church ought not to pray, euen of men remaining in this life: for which it is not lawfull to pray: which by the mercy of God are not pardonable: it is false, that so long as men are in this worlde, they may repent. For which he quoteth Pur. 274 127. 128. 135. 283.</p>
               <p>After he asketh how many such sinnes there are? and saith in one place I name two, and after more, and after concludeth that <hi>in some I say, that it is vnlawful to pray for any wicked person, of what sort so euer his wickednesse be, so long as he continueth in his wickednesse: yea, and it is vnpossible for the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked but to continue in his wickednesse.</hi> This is a pestilent slander, for I neuer accounted any sinne irremisible, but onely the sinne against the holy Ghost: for obstinate and willfull apostasie is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sinne against the holy Ghost, whereof a fruite is finall contempt of all that preach Christ, and of all meanes that Christ hath wrought to bring vs to repentance, such was the sinne of Saul and of the obstinate Iewes, for whome Samuel and Ieremie are forbidden to pray.</p>
               <p>As for that I should say, it is not lawfull to pray for any wicked person, &amp;c. I neuer thought it, but onely for those that sinne against the holy Ghost, of whom Saint
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:13044:188"/>
Iohn saith, they sinne vnto death, and I say not that any man should pray for that. 1. Ioan. 5. Neuerthelesse Bristowe affirmeth, that we are worse then the Nouati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, when I say, <hi>That some sinnes neither by the mercy of God are pardonable.</hi> But where doe I say so? he quoteth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, Pur 128. And what be my wordes there? Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily who so will turne the booke, shal reade them thus: <hi>For by the iustice of God all sinnes are mortall, but by his mercy they are all pardonable, except that sinne vnto death, wherof Iohn speaketh. 1. Ioh.</hi> 5. Thus am I worse tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a Nouatian, for say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sinne against the holy Ghost shall neuer be pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, neither in this life, nor in the world to come. But perhaps Bristowe will cauill, that euen that sinne is par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donably by Gods mercy, if God would: which is not contrary to that I saide. For I speake of that which may be, Gods eternall will standing, according vnto which the Apostle saith, it is impossible that they which so offende can be renewed by repentaunce. Hebrewes 6.</p>
               <p>The heresie of the Nouatians as Bristowe affirmeth of the report of Aresius their Bishop was: <hi>That they who after baptisme, fall into that kinde of sinne. which the holy scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures call sinne vnto death, ought not to be admitted to receiue the diuine mysteries, but to be exhorted to repentaunce, and to looke for hope of forgiuenesse, not of the Priestes, but of God, who both can and hath authoritie to forgiue sinnes.</hi> In which sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, a double error of the Nouatians is included: first that they tooke that sinne vnto death wherof Saint Iohn speaketh. 1 Iohn. 5. to be falling through frailty in time of persecution, euen as Bristowe doth, the willfull prolapsion and Apostasie that the Apostle speaketh of. Heb. 6. Secondly that they thought the sinne vnto death might be remitted of God, contrary to the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest denunciation of our Sauiour Christe. Matth. 12. As Bristowe doeth the sinne against the holy Ghoste, which is all one and the same. But that the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique Churche did then by her Priestes forgiue all sinnes without accepting the sinne against the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghost, which Bristowe affirmeth out of the confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:13044:189"/>
of Acesius, I maruell howe he proueth. Yea, he is so impudent to say, that the Protestantes also doe admit all to their Caluines breade, so the blasphemous dogge barketh against the holie Communion: whereas we ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer receiue any whome we knowe to be excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and much lesse would we receiue any apostata, that is cleane fallen from Christianitie, not of weakenesse or ignorance, but of malicious contempt; or any whome we might knowe to haue sinned that sinne vnto death, and to haue blasphemed against the holie Ghost.</p>
               <p>But nowe let vs see what miserable comfort Bristowe will minister against desperation, in answering such pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of scripture, as I brought, to proue the sinne against the holie Ghost to be irremissible.</p>
               <p>First the place of 1. Iohn 5. he saith is meant of them that be deade and damned in hell, as he hath taught vs: cap. 8. but because I refuse that interpretation, as false and newe, he citeth Augustine. <hi>in ret. li. 19. cap.</hi> 12. whose inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation at the first was as I holde, but afterward he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, <hi>if he end his life in this peruersitie. For we must despaire of no man, be he neuer so wicked, so long as he is in this life. Neither is praier made vnwisely for him, who is not despaired of.</hi> Here are two contrarie expositions of one man, in which we must consider whether is more proper to the place, and not whether better or last pleased the authour of them.</p>
               <p>That no man is to be despaired of, while he liueth, as it is contrarie to the scripture, so to the practise of the Church, which refused to pray for Iulianus the apostata, and prayed to God against him.</p>
               <p>Maris also the Bishop of Chalcedon, denounced him to his face to be impious, and an apostata, and enimie of God. <hi>Socrat. lib. 3. cap. 10. Sozo. lib. 5. cap.</hi> 4.</p>
               <p>The second text, Heb. 6. Bristowe expoundeth it of falling through frailtie in persecution, of them which can not be renewed by baptisme, but the Apostle saith expressely by repentance, and therefore speaketh not of lapsion or falling, but of prolapsion or falling cleane a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from Christ, with manifest contempt of his grace and redemption.</p>
               <p>

The terrible denuntiation of Christ against the obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate and malicious Pharisees Matt. 13. Mar. 3. Bristowe faith, he speaketh it not to driue them to desperation, but to moue them to repentance. What if that be graunted, that by shewing the daunger of malitious ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinacie, which groweth to irremissible wickednes, he should admonish them to beware in time, as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle doth, Heb. 6. Doth it therefore followe, that no man sinneth irremissiblie, while he liueth? Although it is plaine, that our sauiour Christ denounceth their dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation as men so obdurate in their wickednes, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing could reclay me them, or bring them to repe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tance. But Bristow would make me contrarie to my selfe, <hi>who though in expresse words I count D. Allen &amp; his fellowes such as (by you) Heb. 6. cannot repent, yet do exhort them truly to repent. &amp;c. Pur.</hi> 461. But how proueth he, that I count Allen and his fellowes such as cannot repent? Forsooth because I say, they haue sometime beene lightened and tasted of the good gifte of God. Why sir, are all such come to prolapsion? I trow not, In deede I admonish them being in the way of prolapsion, that are curable. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Allen were euer a protestant, I know not: but cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine I am, that some of his fellowes haue beene light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and were protestants, of whom I speake, and not of him. If I say Bristow and his fellowes which are lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men: doe I say Bristow is a lay man? This wilfull &amp; malicious cauilling (Bristow) if you take not heede of it in time, argueth that you are fallen verie deepe, if you be not yet at the bottom of apostasie.</p>
               <p>But this is a cunning co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>forter of them that are in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speration, which affirmeth, <hi>that Christ doth no otherwise say that such sinne and blasphemie shall not be remitted, then he saith that all other sinne and blasphemie shalbe remitted: and therfore many one, yea, and aboue all number may be and is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuen, the sinne against the holy ghost.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He meaneth, because the condition of repentance is not expressed in them that are forgiuen. But if that condition were to be vnderstoode in them also that sin against the holy ghost, what distinction were there for
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:13044:190"/>
which he should say? that blasphemie and sinne shall not be forgiuen, neither in this world, nor in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world to come? Such a sinner hath no remission of sinnes, but is guiltie of eternal damnation. For that none shalbe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuen, without repentance, as euerie man knew with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out that distinction. But Bristow would haue it to be an extraordinary matter for God to forgiue the sinne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the holy ghost, and so he forgaue one of those Pharisees, and he the verie worst of them all: namely S. Paule, who had bin indeede a Pharisee, as he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fesseth. Act. 23. &amp; 26. but none of those Pharisees: for he knewe not, Christ in the flesh. 2. Cor 5. yea, he had beene a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuter and a blasphemer, as he confesseth 1. Tim 1. but not the worst of all Pharesees, for he was an elect vessel of God, and his persecution and blasphemie was not of malice or sinne against the holy ghost, but of ignorance and blinde zeale of God: for he addeth immediatly, but I obteined mercie, because I did it ignorantly in vnbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leefe. As for those Pharisees, against whom our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Christ thundreth that iudgement, did blaspheme the holy ghost against their owne conscience, and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, malitiously attributing vnto the diuell, that which they knew to be the finger of God.</p>
               <p>That which I speake out of Samuel, Ieremie, and Ezekiel, Bristow saith, <hi>is all spoken in one sense, of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall matters, to wit of casting Saule from his kingdome, and the Iewes into captiuitie.</hi> But except the persons had bene incurable, God would haue beene intreated to giue them repe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tance, &amp; to haue continued Saule in his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and the people in their countrie. The rule that Ezechiel. 33. is vnderstoode of sinnes that are not against the holy ghost, as the examples doe plainely declare.</p>
               <p>The 8. poynt is, <hi>that strange interpretation of the creede, (a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> he calleth it) Christ descended into hell to redeeme vs out of hell, by suffering the wrath of God for our sinnes. Heb.</hi> 5. First Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow saith, there is neuer a word of that article, and much lesse of the interpretation thereof, in that chapter, yet after to proue that to bee prayer, which I saide was a complaint, as though it might not be be a complayning
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:13044:190"/>
prayer, he citeth the 7. verse of the same chapter of Christ, who in the daies of his flesh, with a mightie crie, and with teares, offered vp prayers and supplications to him that was able to saue him, out of death, and was heard from his feare or from that he feared <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. But by this text, Bristow would proue, that Christ was not forsaken of his father, no not corporally, although he complayned, that he was forsaken, as though his lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table complaint hadbeene more then needed, when he sayde, My God my God, why hast thou forsaken me? which to him that was God, was greater torment of hell, then any heart of man can conceiue. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Bristow, which maketh all to stand in the bodilie death of Christ, and raileth at Caluine for shewing how necessarie it was for Christ, to suffer in soule as much as in body, for the redemption of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whole man, doth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but cauil &amp; slau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der, one while fayning y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Caluine should make two deathes of Christ, another while, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he was in feare lest he should haue bin da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ned for euer &amp;c. Which he saith also shalbe my reply. But when Bristow saith that Christs bodily death without any suffering of his soule was the full redemption of the world, he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth his tormentes of minde, whereof he complaineth that his soule was heauie vnto death, which made him to sweate bloode before his body was touched, to be of no force, except it were to argue great imbecillitie of Christ, who feared so much bodylie death, that many of his seruantes haue ioyfully imbraced, and that strange crie and teares with which he vttered his prayers on the crosse, and that most lamentable complaint, that God had forsaken him, were for nothing, but for that he was not deliuered from the crosse, (as Bristow writeth) it is too much iniurious to his most bitter passion to i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magine, and therefore we must needes acknowledge, that he suffered more in the sight of God, whose iustice he was to satisfie, then he suffered in the sight of men. And so the question that Bristow propoundeth to me, is answered, why <hi>descendit ad inferos,</hi> cometh after <hi>sepultus,</hi> because the order of the Symbole is first to shew, what
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:13044:191"/>
suffered before men, and then what hesuffered in the sight of God. As for the blasphemy of Theodorus Mopseuestenus that Christ had inclination to sinne, &amp;c. there is no more reason why Bristowe should charge vs with it, then with those other blasphemies, that Christ did dispaire in God, or blaspheme God, or commit some other sinne against God, for our redemption, which he affirmeth to be maintained of some Caluinistes. For which detestable slaunder, if he haue no better ground then he sheweth, let him remember y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the mouth which lyeth killeth the soule. I wil spare to amplifie, though I lack no matter, albeit y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Bristow fayneth mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sters of slau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, as Iupiters Giantes, &amp; then casteth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> downe with thu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>derbolts, deriding myknowledge in amplification.</p>
               <p>The 9. is about the honor of the virgin Marie, wherein first he chargeth me with the heresie of the Heluidians &amp; Antidicomarianites, who were condemned for heretikes for denying her perpetual virginitie; whereas he cometh neerer to the Colliridians, likewise co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demned, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Heluidians. But let vs see his impudent quarels. First I say: <hi>As for the perpetuall virginitie of the mother of Christ, as we thinke it is true, so because the scripture hath not reueiled it, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther perteineth it vnto vs, we make no question of it.</hi> Here is a great co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>iunctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with heretikes, which trobled y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Church with contention a bout a matter which they were not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to proue by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> scriptures: yet saith Bristow, you forge a principle of onely scripture in their fauour. Surely that principle as it is not forged, so it fauoreth them nothing at al. For their contentious assertion they were not able to proue by the scriptures, <hi>but within 4. lines afore, I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to my selfe, where I say all truth may be proued by the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi> If I had to doe with a man of reason, as I haue to do with a papist, he would vnderstand my propositio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the whole matter in controuersie, of such things as are necessarie or profitable for a christian man to know vnto saluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For otherwise I thinke many things to be true, that are not conteined in the scriptures: As I thinke that Bristow lacketh wit, learning, &amp; honesty, thus to quarell which is not written in the scriptures, but ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:13044:191"/>
by other reasons: yet he saith, I might w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestie haue saide, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it may be proued by scripture, where she saith, Luk. 1. Because I know no man, that is (saith he) <hi>because I haue made a vow of virginitie.</hi> A like matter, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> she would marie if she had made a vow of viginitie. Yet Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fesseth this place proueth not inuincibly her per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall virginitie, although it so proue her vow. But if Bristow were conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ned, or had vowed to lie in prison vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til he could frame an inuincible argument to proue her vow, out of that place, yea, or any other place of the scriptures, it were all one, as if he were condemned to perpetuall prison or vowed the same.</p>
               <p>Another poynt of that dishonor is, where I controld Allen for excepting the mother of Christ, when he spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth of sinners, which is all one as if he had said, Christ was not a sauiour of his mother, or that she had no neede of his saluation. And here he chargeth me with rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Caluine more then Augustine, as though Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine defended the virgin Marie to be free from sinne, because he saith against the Pelagians, <hi>that he would haue no question of her for the honour of our Lord, when he speaketh of sinnes. For hereof we know that more grace was giuen to her, to ouercome sinne of all partes, which was worthy to conceiue and bring forth him, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

What victorie is there without a battel? if the flesh in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> virgin Marie, did not rebel against y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> spirite, what victorie had she by grace? But it is plaine Pelagianisme, to hold that she was voyde of sinne or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly righteous. The Pelagian nameth also, <hi>ipsam etians domini &amp;c. the verie mother of our Lord and Sauiour, which he saith it is necessarie for godlines, that we confesse that she was with out sinne.</hi> But thereof Augustine for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> honour of our Lord will haue no question: signifying that although she were not cleere and exempted from fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

But Bristow perceiueth that I would not haue so answered, seeing I affirme y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> by
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:13044:192"/>
the reprehension of Christ, Iohn, 2. she did offend, for he would neuer haue reproued his mother without a cause. And said, what haue I to do with thee, woman? except she had intermedled in his office, more then of dutie she ought. But Bristow would colour his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofe, two wayes: one by false translation of the words <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>? what to me and thee, O woman? not vnderstanding the greek phrase, which is by those words to refuse to haue to doe with one. As the diuels Matt. 8. cried <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>? What haue we to do with thee, Iesus, thou sonne of God, and not as Bristowe translateth, What to vs and thee Iesus &amp;c. But because Bristow saith, that if Christ should meane, that the want of wine perteined neither to him nor to his mother, yet she were not discharged of error, to moue him in a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which belongeth neither to him nor her: He sayth, I might doe well to tell him, what were those sinnes of hers. I thinke the answere of Christ sheweth what her offence was here, and Luk. 5. that she presumed to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termeddle vnder colour of her motherly authoritie, with matter apperteining to his diuine office, of being Christ the mediator, with which she had nothing to doe, as a mother, but was esteemed of him as a woman, who knew when it was conuenient for him to doe, whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer were for the glorie of Gods kingdome, to be done, without her or any other bodies admonition. Neither doe I charge her as Chrysostom in <q>
                     <hi>
                        <bibl>Ioann. Hom. 20.</bibl> Optabat. enim. &amp;c.</hi> For she wished that he might now winne the fauor of men, and that she might be made more noble by the fauour of her sonne. And perchance she was moued with some humane affection, euen as his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, when they saide, shew thy selfe to the world, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing desirous by his miracles, to winne themselues a fame. Therefore he answered more sharpely: what haue I to doe with thee, woman? my houre is not yet come. For that he did reuerence his mother, Luke doth testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie, that he was subiect to his parentes, and this Euan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelist doth shew, how great care he had of his mother in the time of his passion. For where his parentes did
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:13044:192"/>
nothing hinder the mysteries of GOD, did offend no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, it was meete and necessarie for the sonne to be obedient, neither could he deny obedience with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out greate perill. Contrarywise, when they desire an vnseasonable thing, and that which would haue beene an hinderance to spirituall thinges. Who is my mother and my brethren? quoth he. For as yet they had not such opinion of him as they ought: but Marie after the manner of mothers, thought she should haue commanded her sonne in all thinges, by her authoritie &amp;c.</q> But the councell of Trent (saith Bristow) sheweth that she had more neede of Christes grace then all other saints, to preserue her from sinne. But in the meane time, she had no neede of his redemption, for the remission of sinne, who was appoynted to saue his people from their sinnes, who came to seeke and to saue that which was lost, both of the house of Israel, and of the Gentiles, so many as attained saluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. So therefore howsoeuer Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow scorneth at my diuinity, I will still conclude that the virgin Mary, beeing so principal a perso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Christs people, was saued from her sinnes, by the redemption of his bloode, was lost, but sought vp, and saued by him. Which diuinitie being taken out of the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, I trust is more commendable, then the contrarie doctrine deriued from the Pelagians, and defended by the Papistes.</p>
               <p>The 10. poynt of mine ignorance is, about the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition of an heretike, whom I saide to be a man in the Church. I haue shewed before, that I distinguish be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene him that is in the Church, and him that is of the Church; a Papiste, an Anabaptist, may be in the Church, but they cannot be of the Church, except they repent. Where I added vnto my definitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that if any of vs can be proued obstinately to mainteine our opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, contrarie to the doctrine of the scriptures, we refuse not to be counted heretikes. Bristow saith, they may say the like. But the triall is all. Bristow saith, they bring plaine scriptures to proue that all the doctrine of the Apostles traditions, is the doctrine of
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:13044:193"/>
the scriptures. And we say the same, that whatsoeuer the Apostles deliuered in speech, they deliuered also in writing, and neither contrarie to other. But that all true doctrine necessarie to saluation, is not conteined in the scriptures, that you proue not, neither that such things were of the Apostles deliuerie, as you call traditions of the Apostles. As for the particular poyntes you prate of, concerning the time of the Churches persecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and Antichristes raigne, haue beene answered in their proper places. The wordes of Christ, This is my body: we acknowledge to be true, in such sense as he spake them, neither can you prooue that they importe your carnall Carpernaiticall presence, what you hold of Iustification by workes, Worshipping of Images, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sufficiencie of Christes redemption, Impeccabilitie of Marie &amp;c. contrarie to the expresse and plaine textes of the scripture, it were out of place here o make re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hersall.</p>
               <p>The 11. is mine ignorance in wondring at Allen for saying, that a christian scholer should first beleeue, and after seeke for vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding, he hath noted cap 10. Dem. 34. and there haue I answered.</p>
               <p>The 12. poynt proceedeth of like ignorance, where I am said to wonder, when I heare that the sacrifice of the masse is a likenesse of the sacrifice of Christs death vpon the crosse. And then I am asked whether I know not that sacramentes are not likenesses of other thinges: and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine is called to witnesse, with much adoe, as though it is all one to haue sacramentes which are similitudes of Christs death, and to haue a sacrifice of similitude or likenesse, which I saide truly was contrary to the whole scope of the Epistle to the Hebrewes, that there should be any shadowes or resemblances, when the body and substance it selfe is come: which I spake, supposing that Allen by likenes of the exemplar, meaneth the masse with all the apish pageants thereof, to be like the sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of Christes death. And indeede it was that monstru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous saying of Allen, which I wondered at. <hi>By likenesse of</hi> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
                  <hi>exemplar (as indeede being in an other maner the verie selfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>same.</hi>
                  <pb n="371" facs="tcp:13044:193"/>
But Bristow setting a good countenance, vpon so great an absurditie, asketh what boy hath not hearde it saide, of one &amp; the same man being changed by age, sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, apparel, shauing, &amp;c. he is like or vnlike himselfe? But tontrariewise, what boy in Oxford or Cambridge, would not reply, that this similitude or likenesse or vnlikenesse, is of two seuerall shapes, and not of one and the same substance vnto it selfe: as Allen saith, the sacrament is like the body of Christ, and is the very same in another maner that is vnder couerture of accidentes that belong to another kinde of substance. But Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowe is not so quicke to vnderstand me where I vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand not my selfe as he weeneth, where I say: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will it helpe, that Allen saith, it is the selfesame in another manner, so longe as the same respect re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth: I am sorie that Bristowe is so dull headed, that he cannot vnderstand, what the same respecte mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth in opposition, which if it not obserued in the thinges opposed, they are not alwayes opposite, and specially relatiues who hange altogether vpon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect. But Bristowe asketh who can imagine, that the verie same respecte remaineth, when the same manner doth not remaine?</p>
               <p>Why sir? what is the respect of the likenesse of the sacrifice of the masse, with the exemplar? seeing you confesse the manner tobe vnlike, but the verie iden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titie of the thing sacrificed, which is the monster that I maruaile at: as also that you cannot imagine the same respect, where there is not the same manner. Is not God, the father of our Lord Christ, in the same re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect that Abraham is the father of Isaak, but yet after a farre other manner? yea, to follow your owne wise examples, is not Abraham father of Isaak in the same respecte, when Isaak is yonge, and when he is olde; when he is cloathed, and when he is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked; when he is shauen, and when he was bearded; when he is sicke, and when he is whole? Such are the manners in which you houlde that the sacrifice
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:13044:194"/>
of the masse, is the same after another manner.</p>
               <p>The 13. is where I attribute to diuorsement, which the scripture in many places doth deny to diuorsement, and doth attribute onely to death. What is it? to make her no wife, that was a wife. Verily diuorsement for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulterie maketh her no wife, that was a wife, as is ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered euen by those textes of scriptures which Bristowe quoteth Matt. 5. &amp; 19. Mark. 10. &amp;c. where the exception of fornication, maketh the case to be the same that was vsed by permission of the lawe, in diuorsementes, and mariage after diuorsementes. But Bristowe saith, I vtter herein my skil, in many thinges. As in saying that mariage after diuorsements is dispensed with all by the Pope. And doe I not say true, although the Popes law denyeth such mariage to be lawfull? Are there not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny examples of such dispensations?</p>
               <p>Secondly I say, that the Popes canon lawe hath farre many more causes of diuorsement then for adulterie. Bristow distinguisheth the perpetuall diuorse, for adulterie, where the innocent partie cannot be compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to receiue the guiltie partie, although he become ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer so chast; and separation, where the furie of a man is so great, that the wife is in danger of her life: asking if we doe not allow her to dwell away from him vntill he be amended: No verily, but we would compell him to lie in prison from her, vntill his amendement might sufficiently appeare. But what saith your lawe, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning frigiditie, concerning error in the condition of the person, as if she marie a man which is bond, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> she sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to haue beene free &amp;c. Doth not your lawe allow diuorsements perpetuall in such cases? But where I wish that adulterers might be punished with death, first he quarelleth, as though I held that the Iudiciall lawe were stil to be obserued: as though it be not free in such poyntes, as it is conuenient for other common welthes to receiue it, albeit, it is not necessarie. Secondly he houldeth that a man was not punished by death, if he sinned against his wife with a single woman. Where as the case is expresly of a single man, lying with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
'
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:13044:194"/>
mans wife, or of one that was betroathed to another man, which must needes be all one, of a maried man lying with a single woman. Leuit. 20. and Deut. 22. And yet he noteth mine ignorance of the lawe: because I charge the Papistes to allow dispensation for such per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons to marie, as the lawe of God and nature abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth. Then he asketh me, what lawe of God do I meane? but Leu. 18? and whether I thinke that law to binde Christians? Yea verily, for the sense of nature abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth all those forbidden coniunctions. What else mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the heathen Romanes to make lawes euen of the same? But Bristow bringeth in Gods dispensation in the old Testament, which is false: for after the propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of mankinde, for which it was of necessitie allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, it can neuer be proued that God allowed any one of those mariages forbidden. 18.</p>
               <p>But the Pope dispenseth not onely with mary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the brothers wife in affinitie, but euen with the Vncle to marie his Neece, in consanguinitie, as we see in the mariage of King Philippe of Spaine in our daies.</p>
               <p>The 14. after such ignorance in Gods lawe discouered, Bristow marueileth not if I be ignorant in the Popishe Churches lawe and diuinitie, in making it a certaine thing, that the Pope giueth his pardons by the sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of penance. Athough it be no great shame for me to professe mine ignorance in many of the popes lawes &amp; some part of his diuinitie: yet herein Bristow doth me wrong, to charge me to say absolutely, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Pope gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth his pardons by the sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of penance. As though the Pope being at Rome, might minister a sacrament to one in England. And that so great a D. doth not trowe that the power of binding and loosing is exercised ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other wayes besides that sacrament. Seeing the Master of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sentences co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>prehendeth vnder the title of the sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of penance, al that power or what soeuer he can en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire or define of it <hi>Lib. 4. Dist.</hi> 14. 15. 16. 17. But if sins may be forgiue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in popery without repentance, &amp; that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Popes pardons require no repenta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce in them that should take y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
                  <pb n="374" facs="tcp:13044:195"/>
benifite of them, it is one poynt of poperie that I am content to confesse that I haue learned of Bristow.</p>
               <p>The 15. poynt is, that I am ignorant in our own diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, because I wonder that a Papist should say, that God sometime punisheth sinne with sinne, and complaine that when we say, but halfe somuch, they chardge vs to make God the auctor of sinne. For Bristowe asketh, if it be not a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon position &amp; large discourses vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it in our masters bookes, that God is the author of sinne? O im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent and malitious lyer, hast thou read those bookes of Caluine <hi>Insti. lib. 1. cap. 17. 18. &amp; Melanctho<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. ad Rom.</hi> which thou quotest, and darest thou for shame of the world, if thou haue no feare of God, to charge them with hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding such a blasphemous positio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, when they in the same bookes doe refute it, as an horrible slaunder which they neuer thought of: but alwayes affirmed that God as a righteous iudge, not as an euill author Ioseth Satan, and vseth his ministerie for the punishme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of sin &amp; sinners, and for the trial and amendment of his children as in Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid &amp; Iob? As for those blasphemies that God worketh sinne in vs by himselfe, willing, appoynting, and prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinating vs to sin, no lesse the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he, which leadeth a blind man out of his way &amp;c. are nothing else but Bristowes lies &amp; slanders alwaies detested of those godly writers, &amp; of all them that truly professe and imbrace the Gospel.</p>
               <p>The 16. poynt is of mine ignorance in histories eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical, as of the celebration of Easter by the Britons and Grecians, noted before and answered. Secondly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I say (as it seemeth) that Iulianus the Apostata was Emperour after Valens the Arrian. Surely where I lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned that he was a persecutor of the Church, I might haue learned the time of his Emipre, that he was next to Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>stantius, &amp; after him Iouianus, Valentinianus, &amp; Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lens, &amp; sure I am that I learned it out of Carions Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicle 30. yeares agoe. Which being so vulgar a matter, I thought none had beene so malicious to charge me with ignorance therof. But indeede he chargeth me very iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously, for when I say after that when Iulianus the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stata was Emperour, I meane to shewe how persecution and Gentility was restored after that Constantine had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:13044:195"/>
peace, beside the trouble of heresie which was in the time of Constantius and Constans, to whom I ioined Valens, as agreeing in that same heresie of Arrianisme. Againe where I saide, the newe Testament is printed in the Syrian tongue at the Emperors charges, for the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease of Christian faith among them: Bristowe asketh me, what Emperor, or what faith, but Catholike or Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish? That which I saide of the Syrian Testament, was to shewe that the Churches in Chaldea haue preserued the scriptures, which yet are not subiect to the Church of Rome; with the Emperors profession I delt not, but his purpose I suppose, was to encrease Christian faith, and I am persuaded the reading of the scriptures in the mother tongue will not encrease Popish faith, seeing Papists are so vnwilling, that the people should read the worde of God in the natiue language.</p>
               <p>Fourthly that I say the fathers alledging the succession of Bishops against heretikes, specially named the Church of Rome, because those heretikes for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> most part had ben somtimes of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Church of Rome, as Valentinus, Marcio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, Nouatus. Against this Bristowe telleth me, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Allen spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth also of the Arrians, Donatists, and al heretikes. But I spake of those fathers, that alledged the succession of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, namely Irenaeus, Tertullian and Cyprian. Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeus testifieth of Valentinus, Cerdon and Marcion, that they were at Rome vnder Hyginus, Pius, and Anice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus, and that Cerdon came often into the Church and made his confession, and yet taught his heresie priuily and was excommunicated. For Nouatus that he was a Prieste of the Church of Rome, Eusebius is cleare. Lib. 6. Cap. 42. But Cyprian calleth him Nouatianus, whereas Nouatus had beene of Carthage, but from thence was also gone to Rome. I deny not but the similitude of the names might cause the Greeke wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to be deceiued, as Bristowe saith, and it may be that the name of Nouatianus in Cyprian is corrupted for Nouatus, and the other called Nouatus in steade of Nauatus, which name was then in vse. But seeing the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the heretike is certaine, it is folly to striue for his
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:13044:196"/>
name, I haue shewed mine authour for Nouatus <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> Rome, and so for the rest: wherefore I haue not bewraied any ignorance therein, as Bristowe pretendeth.</p>
               <p>The 17. and last point of mine ignorance is, where I shewe, wherein the communion of Saintes consisteth: In that I say, one can not merit for an other, no not for him selfe, but euery man hath his worthinesse of Christe. As though (saith Bristowe) neither Christ could merite for any other, no nor for him selfe, because he had his wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinesse of God. But I say that Christ, because he was God, had his worthinesse of him selfe, and therefore did merite for vs. And see what secret blasphemie is contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in this comparison of Bristowe: Where he would make a similitude of meriting betweene vs which please not God, but onely through his mercy; with Christe, who satisfied the iustice of God. But Bristowe chargeth me so to define the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion of Saints, that I allow no place for the praiers of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> members aliue, made for others y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> are aliue. A vile slander, when I speake of the grace and giftes of God, which as euery one hath receiued of God, so of charitie he is bound to imploy the same to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite of his fellowe members here on earth. <hi>But if we be bound of charitie to pray one for an other</hi> (saith Bristowe) <hi>whie are not these members in heauen as well?</hi> Because there is not a lawe appointed for them that are in heauen, and them that be in earth, we knowe praier is commaunded vs, we knowe not any praier commaunded them: neither are we to trust to any such thing. <hi>But the Scripture saith, that Christes friendes doe reioice in heauen with his penitents in earth,</hi> It saith so in deede of the Angels, and I doubt not of the like affection of the blessed spirites, but of their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge: and if their knowledge were certaine, yet it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth not, that they pray for the conuersion of sinners: and much lesse that the mutuall offices of loue, whereby one member hath compassion with an other, can by any meanes touch the state of the deade, to receiue any bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite thereby. But an other quarrell is, where I make the communion of the whole body, to be the participation of life from Christ the head. If this be all (saith Bristow)
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:13044:196"/>
then there is no communion. <hi>For what communion were it betweene the members of your naturall body, if they did onely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue life from your head, and could not vse the saide life to profite one an other? &amp;c.</hi> This man hath great leasure to trifle without any matter. Who so shall reade my wordes, Pur. 199. which he quoteth, shall finde me to say, <hi>That the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of the whole body, is the participation of life, and all other offices of life that euery member and the whole body hath of the head, as S. Paule teacheth plainely. Ephes</hi> 4. If it be any of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of a Christian life, for one member to assist an other in that it may, and as it ought, I haue comprehended it, but that Bristowe doth wilfully holde my saying, and then play with it at his pleasure. Yet he chargeth me with belying of Allen: that he will haue other workes &amp; waies of saluation, besides y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bloud of Christ, <hi>because he groundeth all works and waies of saluation in the bloud of Christ.</hi> But I reporting his words truly, by plain distribution do gather, that Allen will haue other workes and waies of saluation beside the bloud of Christ: except you will say, that is no way nor worke of saluation of it selfe, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out these waies and works of men. If the bloud of Christ of it selfe be one way and worke of saluation: and there be other waies and workes, though grounded in it, then are there more waies and workes of saluation, than the onely redemption of Christe, which I vnderstand by the bloud of Christ, so I haue done Allen no iniurie, but he hath offered hainous iniurie to the bloud of Christe, and so doe al they which mixed it with any to purchase Gods fauour, who is reconciled by none other merite or satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, but only by the bloud of the crosse of his Sonne our Lorde Iesus Christe, to whome be praise for euer more.</p>

In which, as he pleaseth him self not a litle, so he shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth nothing, but his ignorance, vanitie, and falshood. His ignorance in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation of the Hebrue wordes: <hi>Man Hu,</hi> which doe signifie, This is a readie meate, prepared without mans labor, as euen, the author of the booke of Wisedome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth it. Which Sa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der readeth interrogatiuely, folow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the errour of some olde writers, which could put no difference betweene the Hebrue, and the Chaldee tongs.
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:13044:198"/>
For Man in Hebrewe signifieth not what, neither doth the Chaldee Paraphrase expound it so, but <hi>Manna hu,</hi> that is, This is Manna, that is to say, a ready meate. Againe, he sheweth him selfe ignorant in the Apostles doctrine, when he maketh Manna a figure of the sacrament, which the Apostle plainely affirmeth to haue bene the same spirituall meate, which the sacrament is to vs. 1. Cor. 10. His vanitie appeareth, that when he can racke neuer a saying of the Prophetes to his purpose, he dreameth of a prophecie in the Prouerbes of Salomon, which booke was neuer accounted of wise men for propheticall, but doctrinall: and this pretended prophecie is an allegori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal exhortation of wisdome to imbrace her doctrine, and not a prophecie of Christ instituting his sacrament: an inuiting of men in Salomons time, and all times, to stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die wisedome, and not a foreshewing of a supper to be ordained by Christ in time to come. In the words which he alledgeth, for the promise of the sacrament, is disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered a manifest falsification of the text of Scripture, to peruert the meaning of Christe, which is of his passion, vnto the institution of the sacrament thereof. For the wordes of our Sauiour Christ, Ioh. 6. 51. are these: And the breade which I will giue, is my flesh, which I will giue for the life of the world. These last words (which I will giue) Sander hath fraudulently omitted, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise might seeme to be referred, not vnto the passion of Christ, in which he gaue his flesh for the life of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world, but vnto the giuing of the sacrament of his flesh, in his last supper.</p>
               <p>In the title of performance, he omitteth to shewe, what Christ gaue: when he saide, This is my body, that he might seeme to haue giuen nothing but his body, whereas the Euangelistes teach, that he brake and gaue the breade, which he tooke, affirming it to be his body. The doctrine of the Apostles Sander doth not holde, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he neither breaketh breade, which he denieth to be in the sacrament, nor acknowledgeth a communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting or participation of the Lordes body, which he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth to be receiued of the reprobate, which haue no
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:13044:198"/>
communicating or partaking with Christ. So that he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nieth the sacrament, or outward signe to all men, and giueth the heauenly matter or thing signified by the sacrament, euen vnto wicked men. The beleefe of the Church which Hilarie professeth, Sander maintaineth not: for Hilarie saith, that we do truely eat the flesh of the body of Christ, <hi>sub mysterio</hi> vnder a mysterie, <hi>&amp; per hoc vnum erimus,</hi> and by this we shal be one with him and the father, which can not be vnderstoode of the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish corporall receiuing.</p>
               <p>Last of all, he followeth the custome of heretikes, which is to draw mens sayings inio a wrong meaning, for Tertullian in the place by him alledged, speaketh not of such heretikes, as pretended a figure in the sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, where none should be acknowledged, but he him selfe, by that the breade is a figure of the body of Christ, proueth against Marcion the heretike, that Christ had a true body. <hi>ad Marc. lib.</hi> 4.</p>

                  <head>To the body and blood of our Sauiour Iesus Christ, vnder the <note place="margin">Sander.</note> formes of bread and wine, all honor, praise, and thankes be giuen for euer.</head>
                  <p>I Can not tell whether I should complaine more of the <note place="margin">Fulke.</note> vanitie, or blasphemy of this dedicatorie Epistle: the forme whereof being so newe and strange, that the like was neuer heard of in the Church of Christ, euery word almost containeth a great and grosse heresie. For not content to make the sacrament the very naturall bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and blood of Christ, he maketh it the very essentiall deity it selfe. For vnto whom is all honor and glory dewe, but vnto God himselfe? Againe, seeing he ioi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth not the persons of God the Father and of God the holy Ghost in participation of the praise, by this forme of greeting he doth either exclude them; or if he will comprehend them, for that inseparable vnity which they haue with the godhead of Christ, he bringeth forth an horrible monster of heresie, that God the father and God the holy Ghost, is with the body and bloud of Christ, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:13044:199"/>
the formes of breade and wine. Much like the Sabel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians and Patripassians, which affirmed that God the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was borne of the virgine Marie, and was crucified as well as God the Sonne. Euen so Sander by this blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous and heretical epistle, if he denie not honor, glorie, power, and presence euery where vnto the Father, and the holie Ghost, yet comprehendeth them with GOD the Sonne, and God the Sonne with his body and bloud, vnder the formes of bread and wine. For thus he writeth: <hi>I adore thee my God and Lord, really present vnder the formes of breade and wine.</hi> To which also he saith: <hi>And to whom should I referre the praise and thankes for it, but vnto thee alone? Or of whome should I craue the protection thereof, but of thee? seeing thou onely art a meete patron for the defence of any booke, which only art alwaies present, wheresoeuer and whensoeuer it shall be examined. To the honour therefore of thy body and bloud, I offer this poore mite &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>By these wordes you see, that Sander acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth no GOD, nor Lorde, but him that is really present vnder the formes of breade and wine: except hee acknowledge more Gods and Lordes than one. And consequently, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> either he acknowledgeth not God the Father, and God the holie Ghost, or else he acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth him present vnder the formes of breade and wine, without distinction of persons, and with a blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous confusion of the substance of the two natures in Christ. For the figure called the Communication of speaches can not helpe him in this case, seeing he wil ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit no figure, but a most proper speach in these wordes: This is my bodie. Whereas it is euident to all men, that are not obstinately blinde, that if Christe had purposed to make the sacrament really and essentially all that him selfe is, and would haue declared the same in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per speach, he would not haue saide: This is my bodie, and this is my bloud, which is but a part of him, and the lowest part of him; but he would haue saide, take, eate, this is Iesus Christ, or this is al y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I am. But when he saith: this is my body, &amp; this is my bloud (which if it be not a
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:13044:199"/>
figuratiue speach, should be a dead bodie and a senselesse bloud) he sheweth manifestly, that he commendeth not a meta physicall transmutation of the elements into his naturall flesh and bloud: but an heauenly and diuine mysterie, teaching vs and assuring vs that God the sonne being ioined with vs in the nature of his humanitie, which he hath taken vnto him, by the spirituall vertue of his body broken and bloud shed for vs on the crosse, doth wonderfully feede vs and nourish vs, as it were with meate and drinke, vnto eternall saluation, both of body and soule. If any man think that I referre the words of Sander, to the Sacrament, which he speaketh of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinitie of Christ generally, let him reade the whole Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle, and comparing it with the title of salutation which I haue set downe in his owne wordes, consider whether Sander, professing that he speaketh therein to the bodie and blood of Christ vnder the formes of breade and wine, can be reasonably vnderstoode of Christ, after any other sorte then vnder the formes of breade and wine. Wherefore such bolde speaches as he vseth in this dedication, tending to so grosse heresie, were a declaration of his proude stomake, nowe broken foorth into hainous treason against his owne countrie, and actuall rebellion against his souereigne and natural Prince.</p>
                  <p>But thou O Lord Iesus Christ our onely Sauiour and Redeemer, whome we adore and worship, as our King and God, not vnder the accidentall shapes of breade and wine, but aboue all principalities and powers, sitting on the throne of magnificence of God thy eternall father in heauen, to whom with thee and y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> holie Ghost, we giue al honor &amp; praise for euer, vouchsafe (if it be thy holy wil) to conuert these enemies of thy maiestie, vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> true vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding of thy blessed word, or if their obstinate re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting of thy spirit, so require, shewe forth thy glorious might in their speedie ouerthrowe and confusion, that we thy humble seruantes, beholding thy wonderfull iudgementes, may laude and magnifie thy holy name,
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:13044:200"/>
as well in the saluation of thine elect, as in the destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of thine enemies, to thine euerlasting praise and renoune for euer and euer.</p>

                     <p>THe proposition of this painted preface, is y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures <note place="margin">Fulke.</note> must be expounded according to the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test auctority that may be founde in that kinde, which Sander assumeth to be the vse, custome and practise of the Catholike Church. This assumption is false, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though if it were true, it helpeth the Papistes nothing at all, which can not shewe the practise of the Catholique Church of all times, for any error, which they maintaine against vs. The greatest auctoritie in expounding of the scriptures, is of the holy Ghost, whose iudgemenr can not be certainly founde, but in the scriptures them selues: wherefore conference of the holy scriptures of God, is of greater auctority then y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> practise of men. The scriptures inspired of God, are able to make vs wise vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to saluation, they are sufficient to make the man of God perfect prepared to all good workes. 2. Tim. 3. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the practise and custome of Gods people, must be examined by the scriptures, and not the scriptures ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded after it. Exposition of the scriptures or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesying must be according to the analogic of faith. Rom. 12. But faith is builded vpon the worde of God, and not vpon the custome of men: therefore exposition of the scriptures, must be according to the word of God, and not after the vsage of men.</p>
                     <p>The example which Sander vseth, to confirme his false assumption, is of baptising of infants of Christians, before they be taught, which doctrine he denieth to be proued by the order of Christes wordes, Matth. 28. but by the vse and consent of all nations. To this I aunswere, that the vse and consent of all nations, were not suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to warrant the baptisme of infants of the faithfull, except the same were warranted by the Scriptures in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places: As is manifest in the institution of circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision.
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:13044:200"/>
According to the couenant whereof, the Apostle saith, that all our fathers were baptized in the clowde and in the sea, 1. Cor. 10. and the children of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full are holy, therefore to be admitted to baptisme, 1. Cor. 7. because they are comprehended in Gods coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, according to which scriptures they are baptized, &amp; the infants of Iewes or Gentiles refused, and not onely vpon the ground of the Churches custome and vse ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in (as Sander affirmeth,) which custome is good, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is grounded vpon the Scriptures, but the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is not authorized by that custome. Wherefore po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish confirmation, and adoration of the bodye of Christ in the sacrament, (although he falsely affirmeth, that they are the like custome of the Catholike Church) are Iewde and vngodly practises of the Papistes, because they are not warranted by the holy scriptures, but are proued contrarie to the same.</p>
                     <p>But whereas we alledge the iudgement of the fathers of the Church, for sixe hundred yeres after Christ, to be against transubstantiation and adoration: Sander re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyeth, that things vncertein, must be iudged by things certeine, and not contrariwise. This principle is true: but it is false, that the iudgement of the fathers in the first sixe hundred yeres is vncerteine: as also, that those foure certeinties which he rehearseth, be either all cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teinties, or certeinly on his side. The first is the wordes of the scripture, This is my body: about whose vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing is all the controuersie, and therefore no cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teintie that they are on their side, more then these words are certeine on our side against transubstantiation. The breade which we breake, &amp;c. so often as ye eate of this bread, &amp;c. The second is false, that in the Catholike church, all men worshipped the reall bodie of Christe vnder the formes of bread, &amp;c. for it is the practise one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the Popish Church, and that but of late yeres, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer admitted by the Orientall churches, beside many churches and members of Christes Church in the West, that euer did abhorre it. Thirdly, the Councell of La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terane, kept 350. yeres past, was no generall Councell of
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:13044:201"/>
all that professe Christianity, but only of the Papistes: no more was any that followed, at Constance, Basil, Trent, nor yet that of Florence, in which, although there were some Grecians, yet the councell of Basil, was against it, and many Orientall Churches, that were neuer called to it, neither was there any thing for transubstantiatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or adoration, therein agreed by the Grecians, that were there.</p>
                     <p>For in the last session it is thus recorded: <q>

But the Grecians sayed, that they without the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie of the whole Oriental<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Church coulde handle none other question, seeing the synode was called to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, for that only question, of the proceeding of the holy Ghost.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Fourthly, although Berengarius, was condemned by three Popish councels, and by many learned prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers of his time thought to be an heretike, yet seeing his doctrine is agreeable to the Scriptures, and the iudgement of all the auncient Church, for sixe hundred yeares and more, after Christ, and was also recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by diuers learned preachers in his time, the same being nowe taught in England, is true doctrine, and no heresie. Wherefore, none of the foure certeinties, are certeine and true on Sanders side. But he will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine vs, what Gospell, what Church, what councels we haue.</p>
                     <p>First he saith we can bring no Gospel, where it is wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, This is the figure of my body: Neither doe we af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme,
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:13044:201"/>
that it is onely a figure of his body, nor denye that it is his body, after a certeine manner, as Augustine sayth. And Sander will not deny, but that it is a fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure, which were not true, except it were proued out of the Gospell, which speaking of the Cuppe, sayth: This is the newe Testament in my bloud. And what Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell doeth Sander bring? saying, This bread is turned into my body.</p>
                     <p>To the seconde demaunde, I answere: The primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue Churche, for sixe hundred yeares, did beleeue of the presence of Christ in the sacrament, as wee doe, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring which time, as there was no controuersie, so there needed no generall Councell to be gathered for confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of that doctrine.</p>
                     <p>As there are many other articles agreed on both partes, which were neuer decreed in generall Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels: because there neuer was question about them. But when the question did arise, it was in the time of the prophecyed defection, from Christ vnto Antichrist, and the true Church was miserably oppressed and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>persed, so that no generall Councell could bee gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red about it, neither yet can, by meanes of the ciuill dissention betweene Princes that professe Christ, and the tyrannie of heathen Princes, which holde many partes of the Church in miserable captiuitie and sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie.</p>
                     <p>But the first sixe hundred yeares (saith Sander) make not for the Sacraments, which is declared inuincibly, by three meanes: <q>First, diuerse fathers require vs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly to beleeue these wordes, This is my body, &amp;c. although they seeme to bee against naturall rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son and sense. And yet no wise man will require vs to beleeue figuratiue wordes.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>O shamelesse and senselesse heretike! will not eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry wise man require vs to beleeue all the figuratiue wordes of holy Scripture? Are not these wordes true, although they be contrarie to naturall reason &amp; sense?
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:13044:202"/>
The rocke was Christ, I am the true vine, I am the doore, &amp;c? and if these wordes are true, are they not to be beleeued of vs, in their true meaning? euen so these wordes: This is my body: are true in their meaning, and therefore credite is worthily required to be giuen vnto them. The seconde reason is, that the same fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers teache expressely, that adoration of the body and blood in the mysteries, which is a lowd lye, vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding it of popish adoration. The third reason is, because the fathers teache, that we are made naturally and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porally one flesh with the flesh of Christ, in the worthie receiuing of the blessed sacrament. But this is false: for they teach that the sacrament is an argument as a signe, of our naturall and corporall coniunction with Christ, which is by his incarnation: for our coniunction by the sacrament, is neither naturall, nor corporall, but spirituall vnto the body and bloud of Christ crucified for vs. Wherefore these reasons notwithstanding, the sixe hundred yeres make still for vs. Yet can wee not assure our selues of the first sixe hundred yeres (sayeth Sander) by the writings of the fathers of those times, because none of them goeth about to prooue, that the body of Christ is not vnder that, which the Priest bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth, &amp;c. or warned the people to beware of idolatrie, or haue vsed such wordes, as the Sacramentaries do now vse. If Sander had not in him more impudencie then learning, hee woulde not reason from authoritie nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuely, although his negatiues are not all true. For some of the olde writers deny in expresse wordes, the sacrament to be the very body of Christ: Aug. in Psa. 98. Chrysost. in Math. That they warned not men to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of idolatrie in worshipping the sacrament, it argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that none in their time did worship it, seeing you Papistes confesse, that idolatrie may bee committed in worshipping the Masse cake, if it be not consecrated, and therefore teach men to worship it, with this condition, when they see it, if it be consecrated. Such wordes as the fathers vsed in explication of the mysterie, we<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> vse when we teache, that it is a figure, a token, a representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:13044:202"/>
a signification, a similitude, a symbole, a type of the body and bloud of Christ; and what wordes soeuer wee vse, wee vtter none contrary to their meaning, and tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, of the holy sacrament. But (saith Sander) that they call the sacrament a figure or holy signe, it hindereth not the reall presence, because signes institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by Christ, haue reall trueth in euery sacrament. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doe wee say the contrarie, but that the reall trueth of Christes body, is giuen vnto vs in the sacrament of the supper, euen as the holy Ghost is giuen vs in the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of baptisme, and yet we deny the breade which is the signe, to bee turned into the naturall bodye of Christ, euen as we deny the water, which is likewise the signe, to be conuerted into the substance of the holy Ghost. But the fathers (saith Sander) are not against the doctrine of the Papistes, because no Papist findeth fault with them. By the same reason, he might proue, that none of the Iurie which haue found a theefe guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, did goe against him, because the theefe challenged none of them. And yet Gardener &amp; others challenge Theodoret &amp; Gelasius. Againe he sayth, The fathers are against the Protestants, because they excuse Hilarie, Chrysost. Cyrill, by the figure of Hyperbole, which is a Rhetoricall lye, but in deede, this argument is a lewde lye, of one which knoweth neither Logike, nor Rheto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rike, but like a young smatterer, or a sophisticall cauil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler. For the figure of Hyperbole, is not a lye, more then any other figure of Rhetorike, in the true vnderstanding thereof, whereas after wrong vnderstanding, euen that which is spoken without all figure, is false, and vntrue. Finally, whereas he chargeth vs to denye the workes of the auncient writers, Dionysius, Ignatius, Polycarpus, Abdias &amp;c. that is a lowde lye, shadowed neither with Rhetorike nor reason: for we denye not the workes of those fathers, but we refuse counterfeit workes falsely ascribed to them, which thing if we proue not by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest demonstration, we require no credit. As for that which he cauilleth against master Nowel, I omitte, as being confuted by master Nowel him selfe. But where
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:13044:203"/>
he sayeth, the scriptures woulde neuer abide him, that should saye: This is not my body: I answere, we neuer say: This is not Christes body, after any manner: but this is not his body after a grosse, carnall, or naturall maner, and that saying the scripture will abide, euen as well as this, The rocke was not Christ, naturally, sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantially, or essentially, although the scripture saye, The rocke was Christ. Or this: Christ was not a vine, properly, naturally, or substantially, notwithstanding, that he sayeth: I am a verie or true vine. The prowde bragge which Sander maketh, that popish Catholikes lacke no scripture, for any of their assertions, how true it is, let all men iudge: seing that for many things they confesse they haue nothing to shewe, but tradition vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>written. Likewise, how aptly in this controuersie of the supper, he hath examined the wordes of Christes supper, noted the circumstances of thinges done and saide there, conferred the scriptures of both the testaments, and ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the fathers of the first sixe hundred yeres. And yet he fauoureth him selfe so much in his doing, that hee boldly affirmeth vs to haue no helpe of those things. For scriptures we cannot conferre, to make the wordes of the supper plaine, because Doing, and the words ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, are more playne then any other place of scripture, concerning it, as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> passion of Christ is more playne, then the lawe and Prophets. &amp;c. If this were true, the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles labored in vayne, to proue the passion of Christ, out of the lawe and the Prophets, and the rest of the writings of the Apostles, are needlesse, and vncertayne instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, if the historye of the passion, doth teach all the doctrine that is necessary to be knowen, concerning it. But it is a clarkly conclusion of Sander: <hi>That if the words of the supper be figuratiue, none other can be playne:</hi> as though figuratiue speaches, cannot be playne, when they are vsed for playnesse sake, of them that knowe how to vse them. And because Sander chargeth vs, <hi>Tell me masters &amp;c:</hi> I say likewise: Tell me masters, Are these wordes recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, to be spoken in the institution &amp; action of the sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per? This is the new Testament in my bloud. Tell me
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:13044:203"/>
I say, are these the verie words which Christ then spake, or the interpretation of them? If they be the very words, which of you wil say, they are not figaratiue? If they be y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> interpretation, then are they more cleere &amp; plaine, then those words which he vttered: This is my bloude. Now whether the iudgement of the primitiue Church, for the first 600. yeares maketh for vs, as it hath in many treati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, so in this that followeth, it shalbe shewed sufficiently. Last of all, it wil appeare, both by the scriptures, and te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonie of the fathers, that the iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall senses, or naturall reason, was not the first argument that might moue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that first departed from antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianitie, to the ancient &amp; true vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding of the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries of Christ in his supper. Of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> almightie power of Christ we doubt no more, then of his will reueiled in scriptures, in which seeing we learne, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Christ concerning his humanitie, was made like vs in all things, except sin: and that our bodies, after the resurrection, shal be made like to his glorious body, Heb. 2 ver 17 Phil. 3. 21 which seeing it cannot stand with transubstantiation, wee may not reaso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of his power so, that we should ouerthrow his wil.

                     </gap> signifieth to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour generally, either in seeking that which is absent, or in working that which is present. Wherefore this is a doltish distinction of doctor Sander, and a manifest cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of the text, by leauing out such words as shewe the vanitie of this cauill, and ouerthrowe the difference of this distinction: For the wordes of Christ are these, speaking to the Iewes which sought him being absent, not because they sawe his miracles, but because they had beene filled with his breade. <gap reason="foreign">

And where as Sander saith, that this meat is not laboured for, because it is not sought out by
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:13044:204"/>
our diligence, but giuen by Christ: it is a fonder reason, except you wil say that we must not labor for any good thinges, because all good thinges are the giftes of God. Finally, that you may see what a singular quarrelling, &amp; vaine glorious person he is, to seeke a knot in a rush, you shal vnderstande y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the papistes themselues translate this place euen as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> great bible doeth: namely Heskins, as well learned a Papist as Sander: lib. 2. Cap. 2. of his popishe Parliament.</p>
                  <p>The second text which he pretendeth to be falsified, is ver. 57. of the same chapter: <gap reason="foreign">

                     <hi>Qui manducat me, &amp; ipse viuet propter me. The true English is, He that eateth me, he shal also liue for me. The english bible rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, he that eateth me, shall liue by the meanes of me.</hi> The best colour of his cauil, is that <hi>propter patrem,</hi> is translated in the same ver. For the father. Howbeit, seing <gap reason="foreign">

As for the cauillation, that a man may liue by meanes of him, which is absent, is altogether childish and ridiculous: for who can vnderstande him to be absent, which is eaten? The controuersie is not of the presence: but of the maner of the presence. But howe can the Papists digest this saying of Christ? He that ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth me, shall liue by me, or for me, when they affirme that wicked men eate him, which liue not by him, for this is generally true of all that eate him, and not to be restrayned to them that eate him worthily. For the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament in deede, may be eaten vnworthily, but Christ himselfe, is not eaten, but where he giueth life.</p>
                  <p>The 3. corruption obserued by Sander, is vers. 58. of Iohn. 6. <gap reason="foreign">

But seeing Sander confesseth it is a true say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he that eateth of this breade, vsed by Christ be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, verse 51. heere can bee no corruption, or falsifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion prooued. As for the distinction, which Sander ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth, betweene, eating Christ, and eating of Christ, ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his flesh, and eating of his flesh, is friuolus and vaine: for none eate of him, but they which eate him. Yes (saith he,) <hi>Of him we may eate, without the Sacrament, but him selfe wee properly eate, onely vnder the forme of breade.</hi> Howe vntrue this is, you may see by this argument: None can haue eternall life, except they eate Christ and the fleshe of the sonne of man, and drinke his bloode: But manie haue eternall life, which eate not the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament: Therefore manie eate Christ, and the fleshe of Christ, which eate not the Sacrament.

I would wish some young Redshanke ladde to oppose you, and aske you, what hee brake, and what hee gaue? If hee brake not and gaue not it, which hee tooke. If you say, hee brake his bodie, and not the breade, because you say, he so gaue his bodie, that hee gaue no breade, aduise your selfe, howe you will aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere the breaking of Christes body, which was but once broken for vs on the crosse, but yet not broken into seuerall peeces, as that thing, whatsoeuer you will call it, was broken which hee gaue to his disciples. And this vndoubtedly you meane, when you say, <hi>The wordes of saint Matthew, doe not all stande in order, in so much as Christ said: the wordes of consecration, before hee brake the sacrament, or gaue to his disciples.</hi> And doe you nowe complaine of Saint Matthewe for disordering y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> words? Verily saint Marke, saint Luke, and saint Paul, place the wordes in such sort as saint Matthew doeth. And if all these Euangelists, and Apostles, doe set the words out of order, whence come you, that will take vpon you to set the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in order?

But standing of the wordes out of order, and that in euerie one that rehearseth them, must needes make vncerteintie and obscuritie, yea this standing, or not standing out of order, may decide a great parte of the controuersie: for if the wordes were spoken after he brake and gaue, then he brake and gaue breade. And seeing the placing of the wordes in all the Euangelistes, and saint Paul fauour this opinion, you shall not easily prooue the contrary against so manie faithfull and prudent witnesses, which had a care to place the wordes in such order, as they shoulde giue no manifest occasion of heresie by disordering them.</p>

And then is it not fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in any priuate Masse, where none of the people re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue, nor yet be taught to receiue it. Where he saith, that Christ can not be remembred by eating of bread &amp; drinking of wine, as the Sacramentaries would haue it, so effectually, and with such contrition, confession, and satisfaction, as he requireth, but by folowing of his crosse and death, by penance, by humilitie, by confessing our finnes to his ministers, and taking absolution of them: I answere, the Protestants require not only eating and
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:13044:207"/>
drinking, but preaching of the Lords death, repentance, fayth, loue, and reuerence in the receiuers: as for the rest of popish trumpery, when he can shewe that Christ re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, or the Apostels vsed, we will gladly admit it. In the meane time let the readers iudge, how this later kind of remembrance, can be learned out of the former, which I haue set downe in his owne wordes, of making, lyfting, adoring, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Beside these great corruptions, there are other two small faults, in S. Paul. The first, 1. Cor. 10. that <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> is turned, the partaking, where it should be, the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicating of the body &amp; bloud of Christ. This he coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth a lesser fault, because the Catholike Latine trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, in one place calleth it <hi>participatio,</hi> a partaking: which is (saith he) when parte of a thing is taken, and not the whole. I thinke the translatour vsed the word of partaking, because it is better knowen to English me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, then the terme of communicating: Especially, seing the Apostle vseth both termes indifferently, as one. For in the next verse, he saith, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>: The vulgar Latine is, <hi>Omnes qui de vno pane participamus:</hi> All wee which do partake of one breade: And speaking of them which did eate the Sacrifices of Israelites, of which, euery one did not eate the whole, he saide they were <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, communicators with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uels. And returning to the Christians, he sayeth: <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>. You can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not partake of the table of the Lorde, and of the table of diuels.

<pb n="399" facs="tcp:13044:207"/>
If only sometimes, you must shewe better reason then you do, why it hath such strength heere, or els the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishe translation is good inough. For by the outwarde signe which is the partaking of one bread, the Apostle proueth the spirituall coniunction of all the faithfull in one body, and vseth not the name of bread siguratiuely, for that which Christ calleth the bread of life, &amp;c. And vnto this translation, agreeth S. Ambrose in 1. Cor. 11. saying: The gift that is offered perteyneth to al the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, <q>
                        <hi>quia in vno pane omnes significantur: per id quod enim v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num simus de vno pane nos omnes sumere oportet:</hi> because in one bread they are all signified: for in that we are one, we ought to receiue all of one bread.</q> Of the same iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is Hierom vpon the very place, saying: <q>
                        <hi>Omnes qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem de vno pane, &amp; de vno calice participamus. We all partake of one bread &amp; of one cup.</hi>
                     </q> The like is Chrysost. &amp; all the old writers in a maner. You see what shamelesse cauilling, &amp; racking he vseth, to make a shewe of corruption in the English Bible, against which his malice is so great, that he chargeth not the translators, but the English Bible to haue turned, to haue falsified, to haue corrupted, as though that if there were any iust fault to be founde in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> translation, the English Bible should beare the blame for it, and be despised of all English men. God be than<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, that although it may not be denyed, but some faultes haue and may escape the best translations, yet the translators haue a cleere conscience from falsifying, and corrupting, and the faultes are not so great, that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny pernitious errour may be grounded on them, nor so many by a thousand partes as are in that Latine trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, which the Papistes admit, as onely Catholike &amp; authenticall.</p>

All the Church both Greeke and Latine openly professed the carnall presence of Christes body and blood vnder the formes of bread and wine. For the Greek church neuer receiued transubstantiation, nor yet taught so grossely of the real presence, as the Papists: nor held the same opinion of consecration which the papists doe. For after the wordes of Christ vttered in their litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gye, they pray thus vnto God: <q>

It is also false, that he sayeth, no man in open pulpet, with the auctority or toleration of any spirituall pastor, did preach the contrary: for Wickleef whom he nameth a corner whisperer, in open pulpet preached the same, as his homilies remayning in writing, are a playne testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monye, as in <q>

But nede were here to knowe how men should ghostlye eate Christ. For no man that hath witte dreadeth, that Christ speaketh not here of bodily eating and drinking of his flesh and his blode. For els no man should be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued: for no man is an etene, to seede him thus bodily of Christ, and therefore it were to witte, how men should ghostly feede them thus.

wordes in their owne kinde ben such as were his other wordes, but wite of these wordes there is spiritual and mannes life. Also Christ saieth there soothly, that each man that shall be saued, shal bee fed of Christ thus. But this may not be vnderstonden of fleshly food of Christs body: And so it mote be vnderstonden algatys of gostly foode, for of bodily foode of Christ may not two be fed together, and so Christ speaketh of ghostly food, by which many bee fed farre and neere.

                  <p>But proceeding in his vaine purpose, he sheweth, that the faultes of the popish clergy aduanced by transubstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation, caused them to bee contemned of the people, which contempt by Gods iustice stirred vp Martin Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, like a proude king of Babylon, to come out of the North, to fight against Ierusale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Can you forbeare laugh ing? They that were carnal in the Popish Church, priests bishops to holde their liuings, Abats and Monkes for good pensions receiued this doctrine and gaue vp their abbies to the Prince. But this good hath Luther done, that he separated the good from the badde, especially from the Popish votary, the maried Monke and vowed Preist, which sayeth, No man ought to vowe chastity, condemning therby, not only an infinit number of vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins, but also the blessed mother of God. To this I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, that first of all he slaundereth them, which denye the vow of chastity, or rather celebrate (for euery man is bound to liue chastly) to be lawfull, for they denye it, to be lawfull only to those which are not certeine, that they haue the gift of continency to continue with them long as they liue. And as for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vow of the virgin Mary, I pray you how proueth he that she made any? <hi>Because</hi> (saith he) <hi>she wondered how she might haue a child, seing she knew not any man. Wherunto her own reason might haue replyed that hereafter shee might knowe a man, except shee had vowed her selfe not to knowe at all any man.</hi> I answere, that though her reason might haue so replied, for hauing a child, yet for hauing such a child, as should be the sonne of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est, reason could not satisfie her, and therfore shee desired to be instructed by the angel, by what meanes it should be, without that any vow of virginity, can be concluded
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:13044:209"/>
in any lawfull forme of argument, out of this place, by any Logician in the world. But contrariwise, that she was betrothed vnto a man, it is an vndoubted argument, that she vowed not virginitie. For if she should haue made any vow before her mariage, she would not haue deluded her husband, to promise her body to him, when she had determined the contrarie. If they say, she vowed after mariage: it is plaine by the Gospel, she did it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out her husbandes knowledge, and therefore her vowe could not be lawfull. For before Ioseph was instructed by the Angel of her case, his purpose was to haue taken her home to him, and vsed her as his wife, vntill she was perceiued to be with child, and then he would haue pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uily forsaken her.</p>
                  <p>After this he sheweth what were y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> opinions of Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Zwinglius and Caluine, which he maketh to be three, in number, when by the consent of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Churches of Heluetia &amp; Sabandia it is manifest, that the iudgement of Zwinglius and Caluine, concerninge the manner of eating and drinking of Christes bodye and bloud in the sacrament of his supper, was all one. Now concerning that Caluine willeth vs to goe into heauen by faith, there to feede of Christ spiritually: Sander liketh it not, <hi>because our nature not beeing able to climme vp to the seate of God in heauen, the sonne of God came downe to vs, to life vs vp into heauen, in taking vpon him our humaine nature. So when our faith called for Christ to come from heauen to helpe vs, he let downe the corde of his humanitie, and of his flesh and bloud. And shall wee nowe, when it is let downe to be fastened in our bodies, and in the bottome of our heartes, by eating it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, shall wee nowe refuse it, and say, wee will goe into heauen by faith our selues, and there take holde of Christ, whereby we may be deliuered out of the deepe vale of miserie? As though the corde shoulde haue needed to haue beene let downe, if wee coulde haue fastened our bodyes to anything in heauen, and ye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="404" facs="tcp:13044:210"/>
faith, could haue had no hould in heauen. But seing the sonne of God did not only come downe vnto vs, but also is ascended from the earth, and hath caried vs vp into hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen with him, Eph. 2. ver. 6. he letteth no more downe vnto vs the corde of his humanitye, but we cast vp the sure anchor of our soules, which is fayth, entring into the inward parte of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> spirituall tabernacle, which is hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, whither our forerunner Iesus is entred, being an high preist for euer after the order of Melchizedek. Heb. 6. ver. 19. And vnto this ascension by fayth, the Apostle exhorteth vs Coll. 3. 1. If you be risen againe with Christ, seeke those things that are aboue, where Christ is sitting at the right hande of God, set your minde vpon things that are aboue, &amp; not vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> things that are vpon the earth. These authorities proue sufficiently, that we must goe into heauen by fayth our selues, for the sonne of God after his dispensation fully accomplished in this world, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth no more downe to vs in his humaine nature, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til he come againe to receiue vs actually into the partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation of his glory, according to his promise. Iohn. 14. 3. But now let vs see, what wholesome doctrine Sander tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth in those his wordes euen nowe set downe. First, that fayth perteineth onely to the fathers before Christ, and in them called for Christ to come downe vnto vs, which when he is come, &amp; dayly letteth down the cord of his humanity, we haue no neede of faith to fasten it in our bodyes and hartes, but of our hands. For fayth he compareth to the tongue, by meanes whereof, helpe is called for, but when a corde is lett downe, the vse of the tonge is needeles, and the handes must be occupied. Therfore he saith: It is not sufficient for a man to vse his tongue still, and to let his handes alone. So that by this kind of reasoning, eating it really, being let downe, is the hand, that without the tongue of faith fasteneth it to our bodies &amp; hearts. Thirdly he holdeth, that Christ neded not to haue ben incarnat, if men could haue faste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned their bodies to any thing in heauen. Whereby he denieth, that the fathers of the olde Testament by fayth, were fastened in heauen, before the incarnatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Christ,
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:13044:210"/>
restreining the vertue thereof, not onely vnto the time, since the same was actually perfourmed, but also to the actuall and carnall manner of coniunction of the body of Christ with our bodies, which they imagine to be in eating the flesh of Christ really.</p>
                  <p>To conclude, professing that hee intendeth not to speake against the persons, but against the opinions of the Sacramentaries, specially against Zwinglius &amp; Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine, his purpose is, to proue out of the worde of God: <hi>That Christ giueth in his last supper, the true substance of his flesh and bloud, not onely to our soules, by wordes of promise, but also to our bodyes vnder the formes of bread and wine.</hi> Note here, that the giuing, wherein is the controuersie, perteineth to our bodies, and not to our soules. Also that the gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of Christes fleshe and bloud to our soules, if I vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand this saying, is not really, but by wordes of promise: whereof it ensueth that they, which haue not eaten the flesh and bloud of Christ with their bodies, from the beginning of the worlde, are all perished, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause none can haue life in them, but they that haue ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten his flesh and bloud, which Sander holdeth cannot be eaten, really and in deede, but vnder the formes of bread and wine in the sacrament.</p>

                     </gap> that we are <hi>informed by these words, the supper of Christ to be his owne body &amp; bloud, giuen vnder the signes of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bread &amp; wine, whereupon he gaue thankes, turning by his almightie power the substance of bread and wine, into the substance of his body &amp; bloud.</hi> That Christ giueth his body to them that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the bread and wine worthily, it shalbe no contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersie betweene vs. But that he giueth it vnder y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> signes of bread and wine, vnderstanding (as he doeth) signes for accidents, he should haue prooued out of Gods worde, if either he would or could haue kept promise, likewise, that Christ gaue thankes vpon the bread and wine, and thirdly, that he turned the substance therof into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of his body &amp; bloud. But leauing other arguments for other places, &amp; not being able to proue these things in any place, he wil enquire, whether the name &amp; nature of a supper be more agreable to their beliefe, or to our meaning? that is (saith he) <hi>whether Christ made his last sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of the substance of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon bread &amp; wine, or of his owne reall body and bloud.</hi> As though we affirmed, that the only sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of Christes supper were common bread &amp; wine, &amp; not the body &amp; bloud of Christ. But to proceed, &amp; let him goe with that lye, his first argument to prooue how deintie &amp; costly a banket Christ made, taking his leaue of his friends, is taken of the great preparatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; promise made of it so long before, which promise &amp; preparatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, how euil fauouredly he prooueth out of Melchizedeks bread &amp; wine, Manna, the table of Dauid &amp; Salomon, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bread &amp; flesh of Elias, &amp;c, I omitt. His conclusion is, we must not suppose, <hi>that Christ at his farewell, gaue any other deinties, beside common bread &amp; wine sanctified in vse onely, and
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:13044:211"/>
not consecrated in substance.</hi> You may see, howe absurdly he speaketh, common bread sanctified, which is as good as if he would say, Christ gaue white blacke bread, or whot colde wine. We affirme that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bread &amp; wine were consecrated, not in accidents, but in substance, to the vse of an holy sacrament, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they might be the body &amp; bloud of Christ, to as many as receiued the same worthily, not by conuersion of the natural substance of one thing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to another, but by a wonderfull diuine &amp; vnspeakable change of that which is ordinatily a weake element, of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world, to be a mightie foode, vnto eternall life. The se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond argument he vseth to proue the excellencie of the banket, is of the fine cookerie (I vse his owne terme, which also he doth exemplifie by making 16. or 20. di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shes of egges alone, which cannot be without many spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces &amp; mixture, &amp; great labour, &amp;c.) But Christ, like a most cunning workman, of simple &amp; litle stuffe, and that without help of his disciples, to prepare it, made the gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test &amp; finest feast that euer was heard of, vsing no shifts, but only blessing or thanksgiuing. The sinesse of this cookerie he setteth forth, by a fine speculation of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture of the world, by the Angels, heauens &amp; elements, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whence it pleased God to make a reuolt of al things, from the bottome of the earth, vpward againe towardes him self: And so made out of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> earth vegitatiue thinges, then sensible creatures, &amp; last man, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> a reasonable soule, as a briefe summe of all creatures, &amp; a litle worlde, who being seduced by the diuel, was by the incarnation of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sonne of God, restored, &amp; then al thinges were briefely brought againe to God. So that in this banket, where Christ is giuen, there is serued <hi>in one dish a composition most delicate, of angels, heauens, elements, of herbes fishes, birds, beasts, of reasonable men, and of God himselfe. No kind of salet meates, sauce, fruits, consectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, no kind of wine, aqua vitae, aqua composita, liquors, syrops, can be found in nature, made by art, d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="408" facs="tcp:13044:212"/>
that the breade and wine, being turned into the body and bloud of Christ, are also turned into Angels, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens, elements, herbes, fishes, birdes, beastes, men, &amp; God him selfe? yea, into all salets, meates, sauces, fruits, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, all kindes of wine, <hi>aqua vitae, aqua composita,</hi> all liquors and syrops, beside porredge, puddings, pyes, pancakes, and a great many other thinges, which you haue not named, but comprehended in generall wordes? Is there a reall conuersion in deede, by reason of your heraphicall reuolution? And is this doctrine agreable to the word of God? In what place is it written, I pray you? I suppose it to be this: Eph. 1. It hath pleased God to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store in Christ all things which are in heauen, &amp; which are in earth in him. Where <hi>the Greeke word</hi>

Wherefore, if these things be really conteined, as you say, I thinke it small for the worship of Christes banket, whose excellencie I take to be so great, that it conteineth not these grosse meates of the body, but an heauenly refreshing of the soule. And that will the olde fathers, whome you cite for your cookery, plainly testifie with me. First Cyprian <hi>de Coen. Dom. Vident haec sacramenta, &amp;c. The poore in spirite see these sacraments, and contenting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues with this one dish, they despise all the delicats of this world, and possessing Christ, they disdaine to possesse any stuffe of this worlde.</hi> Beholde Cyprian sayeth nor, that this dish con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teineth al foules, fishes, sauces, spices, &amp;c. but that al these are despised of them y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> are partakers of this dish. Againe, speaking of the wicked, <hi>Et a secretis diuinis omnium intra se continentibus summam, diffugiunt &amp; recedunt, &amp;c. They fly and depart from the diuine secrets, which conteine within them selues the briefe or summe of all mysteries.</hi>

                  <p>

He saith not, they containe meates and drinkes, syropes and confections, but y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> summe of al mysteries or heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, &amp; diuine treasures, <hi>But</hi> (saith Sander) <hi>when saint Cypri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an saith, intra se, within them, he meaneth within the compasse, or formes of breade and wine, for these onely are the thinges that we can poynt vnto, within or without:</hi> Belike he will teach vs newe Grammar, and newe Latine also. For in our old Latine and Grammar, we learned, that <hi>sui</hi> and <hi>suus</hi> were <hi>reciproca,</hi> but Sander will teach vs that, <hi>se,</hi> signifieth the compasse or formes of breade and wine: Or if the worde <hi>se,</hi> signifie themselues, as it was wont to doe, Sander wil teach vs, that the compasse or formes of bread and wine, are the diuine secrets themselues. For Cyprian saith y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the diuine secrets within themselues containe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> summe of al mysteries. But marke his reason, and you wil thinke that an Oxe hath lowed it out, rather then a man spoken it. The compasse or formes of bread, are y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> onely things y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we can poynt vnto within, or without: for other meat &amp; drinke, we see not, quoth he. He will haue nothing but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he can point vnto with his hand, and see with his bodily eye. Whereas diuine secretes, whereof Cyprian speaketh, can neither be seene with the eye, nor poynted at with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> finger, but onely be vnderstoode by faith, in them to whom God hath reueiled them.</p>
                  <p>His next witnesse is Chrysostome: in 1. Cor. Hom. 24 <hi>Quando corpus Christi, &amp;c. When the body of Christ is set be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thee, say with thy selfe: For this bodies sake, I am no more earth and ashes. For this I hope to receiue heauen, and the good thinges which are in heauen, immortall life, the seate of Angels, the companie of Christ. The very table is the strength of our soule, the bonde of trust, the foundation, our hope, saluation, life. If wee goe hence pure with this sacrifice, with most great confidence, we shall ascende to the holy porch or entrie, as it were compassed rounde about with golden garments. But what rehearse I thinges to come? whiles we are in this life, this mysterie causeth, that the earth is heauen to vs.</hi> Whatsoeuer Chrysostome saith here, we acknowledge to be true as he did meane it: but no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing he saith for Master Sanders reuolution, and as lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle for the carnall manner of presence or eating of
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:13044:213"/>
Christes body. For euen as we are no more earth and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shes, &amp; as earth is made heauen, which is after a spiritual manner by fayth, and yet truly and vndoubtedlye, so is the body of Christ present &amp; eaten, at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> table. According to which meaning he saith in the same homily, <q>
                        <hi>Quemad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> enim corpus illud vnitu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> est Christo, ita &amp; nos per hunc pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem vnione coniungimur.</hi> For euen as that body is vaited to Christ, so we also by this bread are joyned in an vnion.</q> Note heere, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> body &amp; this bread to be diuerse thinges in naturall substance: &amp; againe our coniunction to be by the bread mystically: for naturally and substantially wee are not ioyned one to another, but in an heauenly kinde of vnion, we are made one bodye of Christ, and members one of another. And this is not an emptye dish of faith, as Sander calleth it, but a full mysterie of saluation. And although faith shall cease when we haue the full fruition of Gods promises in heauen, yet doth Sander both absurdly, and vnfaithfully gather therof, an opposition of faith and trueth, wheras faith hath thereof the name in Hebrue, because it is grounded vpon truth. But what meaneth he by truth, that which he preferreth aboue the receiuing by faith? Namely the carnall man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of receiuing Christes body, which hee holdeth the wicked may doe to their damnation. A worthy truth, in respect of which, saith is counted litle worth as an empty dish, which yet by their owne doctrine, must make their trueth effectuall to saluation. But see I pray you, howe cunningly he reasoneth of the finall cause. Christ tooke flesh (saith he) that our bodies might haue a banket made to them, as the soules of the faithfull neuer lacked God, whom they might feede on by faith and spirit. By which reason the godly of the old testament, before Christes incarnation, were but halfe nourished, namely in soules onely, and not in bodyes, if Christes flesh bee not a meat otherwise then receiued into the body, after the Popishe meaning.

For what hath deliuered their auncestors from the plague of the Aegyptians, when death ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged against y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> first borne of the Aegyptians? Is it not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest, that they being taught by the institution of God,
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:13044:214"/>
did eate the flesh of a Lambe and annoynted the postes and vpper dore postes, with bloude, and therefore death departed from them? For destruction, that is the death of this flesh, did rage against mankinde for the transgressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> first man. For because of sinne we heard, Earth thou art, and into earth thou shalt returne. But because Christ by his flesh, was to ouerthrow this cruel tyrant, therefore that mysterie was shadowed to the old fathers, and being sanctified with the flesh and bloud of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sheepe (God so willing) they escaped destruction. Why therfore ô Iewe, art thou troubled, seeing the trueth alreadie pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figured? Wherfore, I say, art thou troubled, if Christ say, Except ye eat the flesh of the sonne of Man, &amp; drinke his bloud, you shall haue no life in your selues, whereas it behoued thee being instructed in the Lawe of Moses, &amp; taught to beleeuing by the old shadows, to be most rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die to vnderstande these mysteries? </q>This place of Cyrill, sheweth at large, that he meaneth not by tast and tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, or meate which is of alliance with vs, the naturall bodie of Christ, but the outward part of the sacrament: namely, the bread and wine: for of the bodie of Christ, there is neither taste, nor touching bodily in the sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. But euen as by eating of the Lambes flesh, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noynting of the bloude, which prefigured the flesh and bloude of Christ, and was a meate of kindred or alliance with them, with whose taste and touching they were acquainted, the Iewes were assured of their deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerance: so we by eating, and drinking these outwarde signes of Christes bodie and bloude, are assured of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life. For you must note, that he saith <hi>hoc ipsum</hi> the selfe same thing, was alwayes done by figure, from the time of Moses. What was that? namely, that not onely our soules by the holy Ghost, but also our bodies by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall sacramentes, were brought to immortalitie. But the same thing could not be done according to the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish meaning before Christs incarnation: therefore Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rill is nothing lesse then of the Popish meaning.</p>
                  <p>The last witnesse is Tertullian <hi>de resur. Carnis: The flesh is washed that the soule may be clensed. The flesh is oynted, that

                  </p>
                  <p>In these words Tertullian counteth it, the error of the Capernaites, to thinke that Christ determined, that his flesh should be eaten verily, meaning that his fleshe was not to be eaten after a grosse and naturall manner, with the mouth and teeth, but with faith, and heart. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine the argument of the resurrection of our bodies, which he draweth of eating the bodie &amp; bloud of Christ, cannot stande but with a spirituall eating thereof. For what hope should all the fathers before the incarnation of Christ, and so many thousand Christians as since that time haue neuer receiued the sacrament, haue of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection of their bodies, if the vertue thereof were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in the popish imagined manner of eating? Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Tertullian meaneth plainely, that the externall sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, which are receiued with the body, &amp; beare the name oftentimes of the thinges, whereof they are sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, are arguments and assurances, that saluation per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teineth both to the bodie and to the soule, and not that the bodie eateth and drinketh really the substance of Christs body and bloud, vnder the formes of bread and wine, any more then the body receiueth the holy ghost vnder the forme of water, or imposition of hands &amp;c.</p>

But either he is ignorant what we teach, or rather he is not willing to shewe it, that by rehersing it imperfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, he might haue more aduantage to dispute against it. We beleeue, that Christ giuing vnto vs bread and wine, as visible seales of his inuisible grace, giueth to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whole man, his body and blood, to be receiued of him by faith, after a spiritual and wonderful maner, passing al vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing of man, wherby we are assured, that we are spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually fed, vnto eternal life, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as by the seale of bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme, we are assured that we are spiritually, and wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully washed from our sins, &amp; born anew to be y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sonnes of God.

The sinne of Adam was not in eating, but in eating disobediently, so that eating of it selfe, was no fault, nor any poyson was
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:13044:216"/>
in the nature of the fruite, that was eaten, as Sander dreameth, but disobedience was the sin of Adam, which by the obedience of Christ is done awaye as S. Paul tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth, Rom. 5. ver. 19. As by the disobedience of one man many were made sinners, so by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> obedience of one man many shall be made righteous. Neither doth Cyprian saye otherwise, although he allude to the tasting of the forbidden fruite, <hi>De Coen. Dom. Bibimus &amp;c: We drinke of the bloud of Christ himselfe commanding, being partakers of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life with him, and by him, abhorring the sinnes of naturall lust as vnpure bloud, &amp; granting our selues by tast of sinne to haue ben depriued from blessednes and condemned, except the mercy of Christ, had brought vs againe vnto fellowship of eternal life by his bloud.</hi> Although Cyprian here allude vnto the acte in which disobedience was committed, yet in the end he sheweth, that by the obedience of Christe shedding his bloud for vs, we are restored into the fauor of God, and not by actuall drinking of the naturall bloud of Christ into our bodyes. Neither doth Prosper Aquitanicus thinke otherwise, <hi>Cont. Collat, Liberum ergo arbitrium &amp;c. Free will therfore, that is, the voluntary appetite of the thing that pleased it selfe, after it had lothed the vse of the good thinges which it had receiued, and the aydes of his owne happines, waxing of such account with it, bent his impotent greedines, vnto the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of disobedience, dranke the poyson of all vices, and drou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the whole nature of man with the dronkennes of his intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance Thence it commeth, that before the eating of the same flesh of the sonne of man and drinking his bloud, he digest that deadly surset, he fayleth in memory, erreth in iudgment, wauereth in going, neither is he by any meanes meet to chuse and desire that good thing, wherof he depryued himself of his owne accord.</hi> This eating and drinking cannot be vnderstood of eating and drinking the Sacrament, for the will of man must be prepared both to chuse and desire that good, from which man is fallen, before euer he be admitted to the Lordes table, as euery Papist will confesse. What im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudencie then is it, vpon shadowe of some allusion, to drawe the ancient Doctors sayings so contrary to their meaning? But Sander seeing the shamefull absurditie
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:13044:216"/>
that followeth of this his imagined reall eatinge of Christes fleshe, to satisfie for the reall eating of Adams aple, for so he calleth it, saith it is no more needfull that euery ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> should eate the body of Christ in his own person, then that euerye one should eate of the aple to make them guilty, <hi>but it is absolutely needful</hi> (saith he) <hi>that some <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>r other eate it as really, as euer the apple was eaten, that all the rest, who by baptisme enter into the same body, may be one perfectly with Christ, whiles they are one mystically with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, who really eate the substance of Christes flesh, being the substance of our true sacrifice, truly rosted vpon the crosse.</hi> This shift of des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant, then will not serue the fathers of the old testament, which were not baptised verily as the Papistes holde, but in figure only. Secondly if any such real eating were necessary, it were not to be fulfilled by any, but by our sauiour Christ: for what soeuer the transgression of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam was, who being but one, made al guilty of damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that was to be satisfied by the iustification of one man, which was Christ, sufficient for all men vnto iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of life, Rom. 5. ver. 18. Last of all I praye you marke Sander his phrase of speech: <hi>The flesh of Christ was truly rosted vpon the crosse.</hi> To omitte the grosse figure of rosting., and to register it among the other pointes of fine cookery in the chapter before described: Marke that he saith, it was truly rosted vpon the crosse, and yet I dare say, he meaneth not that the crosse was a very spitt, nor yet burning with fire to scorche it. But when we affirme that Christ is truely eaten, he can by no meanes allowe our saying, except we should meane as he doth, that Christ is putt in at our mouthes, and if not chewed with our teeth, which some of them holde, yet swallo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed downe our throte, and so receiued into our bodies, to nourish them. But if he saye well that Christes flesh was truely rosted vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the crosse, because his body being broken on the crosse, was made meate for vs, although it were not rosted with fire, &amp;c. then may we rightly saye, that Christes body and bloud is truely eaten and dronken of vs by faith, although it be not put in at our mouthes, nor swallowed down our throtes, &amp;c. He saith

After this, he alledgeth Gregorius Nyssenus in Orat. Cathe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>. to proue that it is necessary, as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> poisoned apple was ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten of Adam to infect vs with original sinne, so, that the body of Christ be receiued into our body, as really by our mouths, as euer the apple came in the mouth of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam. That he nameth not the 37. Chapiter, where such a matter is spoken of, it may be, the copy he saw, had no diuision of Chapiters: but rather I feare he suppressed it of fraude, because that Chapiter is confessed euen by Sonnius a Papiste, not to bee found in many copies of that Catheticall booke of Gregory: and in deede the argument of that part of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> oration which goeth before, and of that which followeth after, being of regeneration in baptisme, which argument is interrupted by this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course of the supper, sheweth that it is foysted in by some late writer, which would haue the new doctrine of transubstantiation to bee credited vnder colour of the authority of this ancient father. For if Gregory had ben purposed to haue spoken of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lords supper in this booke of instruction, which he did write for to shewe the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and doctrine of Catechizing, he would first haue fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished his treaty of baptisme and regeneration, and afterwarde haue descended to the other parte of Gods dispensation, which consisteth in preseruing and feeding his children that are borne vnto him, which grace is represented in the Lordes supper. I passe ouer y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Nicepho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus testifieth, euen y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> book in his time to haue bene cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted by diuers heretiks &amp; Origenists by name, which corruption and diuersity of copies gaue some transub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiator good hope, that his addition in such variety of bookes might happilye of some be accounted for the
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:13044:217"/>
authentical authoritie of Gregorie. And he was nothing deceiued. For M. Sander, whether he think it to be such, or onely would haue vs to acknowledge it for such, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembling the vn certeintie thereof, which other papistes confesse; setteth it foorth, as the sounde and vndoubted authoritie of Gregorie Nyssene. As for his vaine ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uilling, that the figure of a medicine healeth not, is foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish and absurde: for so he might reason, that baptisme is no medicine for originall sinne, but a figure of a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine. We make not the sacraments figures of medicins, but outward signes of inward and spirituall healing. The vertue of cleansing sinnes, is not included in the water, no more then the spirituall feeding is in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> breade and wine. And more absurde it is, that hee chargeth vs with shadowes in the sacraments. And where he sayeth, that all spirituall giftes are inferiour to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> flesh of Christ being in our mouth: if he meane inferior in vtility, it is false: for by those spiritual gifts without that flesh, which he imagineth in our mouthes, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Papists confesse, that we may be saued, but with that fleshe in our mouthes, by their owne doctrine, we may be damned.</p>
                  <p>From this place he beginneth to raue against Caluin, although he haue appointed a whole chapter following to confute his error. Caluines supper he sayth, in respect of Christs real substance, is but a meere sauour of sweete meates. As though Caluine did not acknoweledge that Christ is truly eaten of them, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> worthily receiue the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments. Beside this he chargeth Caluine, as one y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth forth the kingdom of the diuel, &amp; abaseth the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom &amp; gifts of God. Because he hath diligently &amp; elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently set forth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> doctrin of mans fall &amp; da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nation, but in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> doctrine of saluation &amp; renouation by Christ, he hath dealt faintly &amp; weakly. God be tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ked, they which wil read Caluin of this point, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> indiffere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, wil co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fesse, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he hath shewed no lesse diligence &amp; eloquence therin, then in the other. And wherfore hath he set forth y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> one, but for the glorie of the other? And euen by those things which be not slanders in Sand, by which he saith he hath abased y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> kingdo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; gift of God, he hath greatly
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:13044:218"/>
magnified the glorie thereof: which is, that all power, vertue, helpe, comfort, grace, &amp; giftes, come onely from God by the onely meanes of Iesus Christ. Hereof it is that Christes litle flocke is contemptous in the eyes of the worlde, that many are called and fewe are chosen, that his Church hath no sacrifice propitiatorie, no po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish priesthood, no one sheepheard on earth, but onely the death, eternall priesthood, and greate sheephearde Iesus Christ. As for the colde supper, small offering of sufficient grace, baptisme like a sheepemarke, no autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie to make lawes, no communion of Saintes, no reall ioyning and vniting with Christes fleshe and bloud in the holy mysteries, &amp;c. be Sanders lyes, and slanders; not Caluins assertions. After he hath railed a crash at Caluine, vnto whose felicitie this may be added, that he is slandered by so euill a person, as Sander is, he repeteth the diuerse suppers of Luther, Zwinglius, Caluine, ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to them also the fantasticall opinion of that epicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian gospeller, Carolastadius, and disseuering Caluine from Zwinglius, with whome he agreeth fully. And Caluines supper he saith, were good for Angels, to feede vpon immortall meate in their soules, but Christ hath giuen his bodie and bloud to be eaten and drunken of our bodies to feede on. Verily, euen as he hath giuen the holy ghost to wash vs body and soule from all our sinnes, and to regenerate vs to be the sonnes of God: Sander might say, if he would, this were a regeneration, or birth, good for Angels, that haue no bodies. For hee will not vnderstand, that both bodie and soule may bee nourished by spirituall foode, as well as both body &amp; soule borne a newe by a spirituall washing and engraf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fing into the body of Christ. But the Corinthians (saith he) had two faultes, both which the heretikes doe followe. The first fault, they came to it after they had eaten their owne supper, so the heretikes first deuise what supper they wil allowe Christ, and then they come to it, conforming it to their deuise. In deede so doe the Papistes. The second fault was, they did eate and drinke alone without making their meate common to the
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:13044:218"/>
poore: so the heretikes eate and drinke alone, teaching, that euery man eateth Christ onely by measure of his owne faith. Nay rather the Popishe heretikes eate and drinke all alone often times, not tarying for other to communicate with them, and alwaies they drinke all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, giuing no parte to them that woulde drinke with them, which is worse then the Corinthians did: for they eate not their supper alone, which teach that Christe must be eaten of the whole Church together, requiring faith in euery man that shall receiue the Sacrament worthily. But Sander maketh Christ so liberall, that he giueth himselfe to all that sit at the table, riche or poore, good or badde. In deede, he offereth himselfe to al, but he giueth himself to none, but to such as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue him thankefully, and which take profite by him: wherefore he saith, He that eateth mee, shal liue for me, whereupon it followeth inuincibly, that hee which li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth not for him, eateth him not. Neither sayth Hierom any thing contrarie to this, where he sayeth, that Christ hath giuen his body to be eaten, himselfe beeing the meate and the feaster or guest. True it is, that Christ alone in his death, was the priest, the Sacrifice, and the temple, or altar, not <hi>playing all partes,</hi> as Sander lewdly speaketh, but perfourming throughly in his owne per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, whatsoeuer was necessarie for our full and perfect redemption, the seale and assurance whereof, with al be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefites thereto belonging, he giueth vs in his holy sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and not bare odours of spirituall grace, but a true communicating of his body and bloud vnto euerlasting life, of as many as with a true and liuely faith receiue it spiritually, as their bodies receiue the outwarde ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of bread and wine bodily. Like as in baptisme wee receiue not bare odours of spirituall grace, but are verily borne a newe, and ingraffed into the death, buri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, and resurrection of Christ, after a diuine and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly manner with forgiuenesse of our sinnes, euen as outwardly our bodies are sprinkled or washed with pure water. Wherefore, that which wee teache of the receiuing of the body and bloud of Christ by faith, is

                  <argument>
                     <p>A speciall errour of Caluine is confuted, who taught, This is <note place="margin">Sander.</note> my body, which is giuen for you, to be wordes of promise, in the way of preaching at Christes supper, whereas they are wordes of performance in the way of working.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>The long babling, quarelling, and wrangling, that he vseth in this large Chapter, is grounded vpon one poore <note place="margin">Fulke.</note> sophistication of Sander, in disioyning those thinges, that are to be conioyned &amp; matched together. Namely, where Caluine saith, the saying of Christ to be wordes of promise: Sander presseth him to say, they be words of promise onely, where he sayeth expressely, that they are also wordes of perfourmance, as Sander himselfe trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lateth his words: <hi>They are a liuely preaching, which may shew his efficacie in accomplishment of that it promiseth.</hi> Is not effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacie in accomplishment, which is al one with perfour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance, here ioyned with promise? To omit therefore his railing against Caluine, for singularitie, &amp; against y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> preachers of England, for following his fansie, &amp;c. let vs see, what mater he hath to bring against Caluins saying, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> those words are words of promise. First he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fesseth, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they are words of promise, fulfilling a promise made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, at Capernau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Also they are words of promise, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of the death of Christ, which is promised in these words <hi>which is giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for you, or, shalbe giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for you, &amp;c.</hi> but this saying. <hi>This is my body,</hi> is no more words of promise, then the saying: <hi>This is my welbeloued sonne,</hi> which are wordes of witnesse, of a thing present. Then he will teache the difference betweene a promise and a perfourmance: a promise (sayth he) beginneth the bargaine, the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fourmance endeth it. Let it be so, that should proue the wordes of Christ to be a promise, whereof the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fourmance followeth vpon the conditions required.</p>

                     <pb n="423" facs="tcp:13044:219"/>
In the institution of the supper, there is mention of a newe couenant. In euerie couenant there must be two parties at the least. Christ is one partie, but who is the other partie, will Master Sander saye? Euery man, or euery faithfull man onely? The newe testament is a couenant of forgiuenesse of sinnes, but forgiuenesse of sinnes is not obteined of all men, but onely of them that beleeue: therefore not all men, but only the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full are the other partie in this couenant. Wherefore, though the promise of eating of Christes body, euen as of forgiuenesse of sinnes, is offered by Christ general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to all men, yet the perfourmance is onely vnto the faithfull, which are the other partie of the couenant. Whereof it followeth, that the wicked men eat not the body of Christ, and so the words of Christ are wordes of promise, the perfourmance wherof was in them that did receiue faithfully, that which he offred. But the wordes of Christ (saith he) speake not of the time to come, but of the present time, <hi>ergo</hi> no promise. A sorie reason, by which he might proue, a thousand words of promise in the Scriptures, to be no wordes of promise, because they are spoken, not onely in the present time, but also in the time past. And yet the wordes of Christe must haue relation vnto the time to come. For Christ did not consecrate breade and wine into his body and bloud, but with purpose, that they should be eaten and drunken. And therefore hee biddeth them first eate &amp; drinke, and then sayeth, This is my body, this is my bloud, that is to saye, In eating and drinking this bread and this cuppe, you shall eate and drinke my bodye and bloud: Therefore, in these wordes, This is my bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die: the couenant is not ended, as Sander sayeth, vntill that which is offred on the one partie, be accepted on the other partie. Where he affirmeth, that wordes of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, consist in bare talke, he giueth a bare iudgement of the promises of God, which are effectuall in worke, although they bee vttered in wordes. And when hee sayeth, they haue no condition, or delaye an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed, it is vntrue, although it bee not necessarie,
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:13044:220"/>
that euery promise should haue a condition, for many promises are made absolutely. But Gods promises re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire the condition of faith, in them that shall obteine the performance of them, and so doeth this. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the promise of spirituall communicating, (which Sander obiecteth) helpeth not Iudas, because he recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth it not with faith. Sander asketh Caluine, whether the condition of faith, be written in the supper or no: If not, how dare Caluine supply it? Hath he not choked Caluine with this question, trowe you? But if Caluine can finde a couenant in the supper, he wil not seeke farre off, to finde faith, necessarily required in the receiuers thereof. But he hath two other reasons against y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, one of the worde, This; another of the worde, Is. This (saith he) sheweth where the thing is, that it poin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth vnto. The body of Christ is promised, &amp; also poin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vnto. If the worde, This, be such a pointer, I praye you syr, where is that which is pointed vnto, when hee saith of the cuppe: This is the newe testament in my bloud? Was that which seemed the cuppe, or that in the cupp the newe testament, which was pointed vnto? If it were a sacrament or seale of the newe testament, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed in his bloud which was shed for vs, then was the other a Sacrament or seale of the newe testament, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed in the breaking and giuing of his body for vs. It angreth Sander, that Caluine should: say Christ saying, This is my body, speaketh not to the bread, but to his disciples, wherein he would make him so singular, that not onely the Papistes, but also all Lutherans &amp; Zwin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glians, do confesse the wordes to be spoken to the bread, which is a shamefull lye, both of the Lutherans &amp; of the Zwinglians, for none of them is so madde, to thinke that when he began to speake to his disciples, and saye: Take and eate, then he turned his tale from them, and spake to the breade, when he saide: This is my body, &amp; then againe to his disciples, when he saide, which is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen for you: For, if hee had spoken to the bread, hee would haue saide, thou art my body, and not, this is my body, which is of the thirde person. And to put all out
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:13044:220"/>
of doubt, S. Mark saith, speaking of the cuppe, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, and he said vnto them, This is my bloud. If he spake not to the wine, but to his disciples, when he said, this is my bloude, then surely hee spake not to the breade, but to his disciples, of the breade: when he said, This is my bodie. Marke this well, for although it bee but a small matter, yet it ouerthroweth the whole myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of Popish Consecration. The argument of this verbe, <hi>est,</hi> is, taketh for proofe, that which is in controuersie, namely, that it is put properlie, because it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede Christes bodie, when the wordes are spoken. But seeing by your owne diuinitie, it is not the bodie of Christ, before the laste syllable, <hi>vm,</hi> bee pronounced, howe coulde the Verbe <hi>est,</hi> bee taken properly: when neither before it was spoken, nor while it was in spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, the bodie of Christ was made of breade? But Sander will knowe, by what Scriptures, Caluine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth <hi>his lewde interpretation:</hi> As though Caluine affirmeth any thing, of this matter, which hee prooueth not plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully by the scriptures, which are of the nature of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments generally: and of this Sacrament especially, of the nature of the humanitie of Christ, &amp; of manie tropi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call speeches, vsed throughout the scriptures, which hee that wil, may read at large in his writings. In the meane time, let vs see, how Sander doth confute <hi>his fond opinion</hi> by the word of God.</p>
                  <p>The first argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of confutation, is gathered of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ps, vsed in these words: This is my body, which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeth not with the nature of a promise, which is a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of a thing to come. I haue before answered this lewd argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t: for al promises are not vttered in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> future temps: Esay saith, <hi>Puer natus est nobis,</hi> a child is born vnto <note place="margin">Esay. 9.</note> vs, when he was not borne, 500. yeares after. I haue shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before, that the words, This is my bodie, haue relatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> eating which followed after they were vttered. Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine saith further, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Christ speaketh not to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bread, that it should be made his bodie: But he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundeth his disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples to eate, &amp; promiseth them y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municating of his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die &amp; bloud. Against this, Sander replieth, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>God said to his
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:13044:221"/>
disciples, take, eate, which is a commandement, and no promise: He saith further, This is my body, that is, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> making of the meate, which must be eaten, &amp; the shewing of it, but no promise.</hi> S. Paul saith, 1. Cor. 10. The bread which we breake, is it not the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating of the body of Christ? Who dare say the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie? But is the bread which we breake, an actual com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating of the bodie of Christ, before we eate it? No verily. Howe is then the bread that we break, a commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicating of the bodie of Christ, before we eate it, but by promise of communicating to them, that shal eat it faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully? And if these words, This is my bodie, be not words of promise, of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municating his bodie, what other words of promise, can Sander shew in the institution? But nowe will Sander prooue at large, that Christ spake not to his disciples, when he saide, This is my bodie: but to the breade. Although I haue alreadie prooued, out of the words of S. Marke, that Christ spake to his disciples, so plainely, that Sanders eares may gloe on his heade for shame, to reade it: yet will I consider all his particular argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, by which he taketh vpon him to prooue, that Christ spake to the breade.</p>
                  <p>The first reason, Christ speaketh somtimes to vnsensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble creatures: as to the windes, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> figtree, and all creatures heere y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> voyce of God, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he speaketh to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, so he spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth heere, to the bread. If this consequent, did hange to the Antecedent by any necessity, I would grant it; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise I must denie it. Well, yet thus much is gained, that it is not absurde, that Christ should speake to the breade, being a senseles creature. yes verie absurd, that beginning to speake to men, he should sodenly make an apostrophe to bread, and without any transition, but euen with a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latiue, as sodenlie return to speak to men. And y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> speaking to bread, he should vse no word of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> second perso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which he vseth, in speaking to the Winds, &amp; to the Figtree.</p>
                  <p>The second reason beginneth thus: <hi>Caluine saith, Christ spake not to the bread I tell him, he spake to the breade, not as to a thing which shoulde carrie bread, but as to that which shoulde be chaunged into his bodie: For he called the bread his bodie.</hi> Is not this a magistrall, or doctorall kinde of reasoning? I tell
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:13044:221"/>
him (quoth Sander) it is so: but how proueth he y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Christ spake to the bread, because he called it his bodie? Which if Caluine wil denie, hee hath it readie out of Tertulli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, <hi>aduer. Marc. lib. 4. Panem corpus suum appellat: He calleth the bread his bodie. But we cannot call a thing, except we speake vnto it. Therfore when Christ called the bread his bodie, he spake vnto the breade, as if he had said vnto the bread, be thou my bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die.</hi> Who woulde haue thought it? Sander cannot call a stone, a stone, but he speaketh to a stone: nor a shouell, a shouell, but hee speaketh to a shouell. And with San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, it is all one, to say: This is a shouell, or a stone, and be thou a shouell, or a stone. Nay, he will say, with God, calling and making is all one, where he will make one thing of another. In deede that is another matter. If this will of God coulde be prooued, of the bread to make his naturall bodie, calling and making might be one, and yet it woulde not followe, that Christ intending to turne breade into his naturall bodie, by these wordes: This is my bodie, coulde not doe it, except hee spake to the bread.</p>
                  <p>But nowe let vs see, howe hee proueth, that Christ made the breade, his naturall bodie. First, Ambrose wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth <hi>de iis qui myst. init. Cap. 9. Ante bene dictionem &amp;c. Before the blessing of the heauenly wordes, it is named another kinde, after consecration, the bodie is signified. He himselfe nameth it his bloude. Before consecration, it is named another thing, after consecration it is called bloude. And thou sayest, Amen: that is, it is true. That which the mouth speaketh, let the inwarde minde confesse. That which the speech soundeth, let the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on feele.</hi> Out of these wordes, Sander saith, that it is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uident, that Christ spake to the breade and wine; but by what reason, I cannot deuise: and that the making of them, is in deede so as they are called and signified, because the people answered, Amen. I graunt the breade and wine, are made sacraments, to signifie the bodie and bloude of Christe, and that is it, which the people con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse, if Ambrose expounde the words of Christ truely, when hee saith, that the bodie of Christ is signified after consecration by that which was called breade and wine
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:13044:222"/>
before the words of blessing, and afterward is called the body and bloud of Christ. This 1. witnesse speaketh not so much against him, but Tertullian, his second witnesse speaketh much more. <hi>Acceptum panem &amp; distributum disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulis, corpus suum illum fecit: Hoc est corpus meum, dicendo, id est, figura corporis mei. He made the breade which was taken, and distributed to the disciples, his bodie, saying: This is my bodie, that is to say, the figure of my bodie.</hi> Loe hee made the breade his bodie. Wee confesse, but howe his bodie? That is to say, a figure of his bodie: but beeing a fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure stoppeth not the reall trueth of his bodie (saieth hee): no more then Christ, being a figure, printe or forme, of his fathers substance, which is yet also his substance in deede. What sayest thou, Sabellian here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tike? Is not Christ a distinct hypostasis, from his father, because hee is Homousion of the same substance, and is not that proued, because hee is <hi>Character substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiae patris?</hi> And yet there is great difference in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the persons of the diuinitie, with the figures of Christ. Yea saieth Sander, <hi>There can bee no more grosse, more vile, more blasphemous opinion, then to thinke that Christ is a bare man: &amp;c. Or that his figures are like the figures of the olde Lawe. And againe, looke what oddes is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene God and man, so much beleeue thou to bee betweene his naming, or his figures of the newe Testament, and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther figures.</hi> Why Sander, were the namings in the old Testament of man, and not of GOD? Were the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures instituted of man, and not of God? Yea, were they not instituted of Christe himselfe? If they were instituted of God, howe followeth thy beastly conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, of the difference, or oddes of figures, and naming of the newe Testament, and figures, and namings of the olde Testament? The rocke was Christ, it was a figure and naming of the olde Testament, so na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med and instituted by Christ himselfe, why shoulde there be more transubstantiation of the breade, then of the rocke? except as thou wast euen nowe a Sabellian, so in this thou art a Marcionite, that beleeuest ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther GOD, and Christ of the newe Testament,
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:13044:222"/>
then was of the old Testament.</p>
                  <p>Augustine, speaking of the figures of the old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and comparing them with the figures of the newe Testament, sayeth, <q>
                        <hi>Sacramenta illa fuerunt, in si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnis diuersa sunt, in re quae significatur paria sunt.</hi> Those were sacraments, they are diuerse in signes, but in the thinge which is signified, they are equall.</q> 
                     <hi>in Ioan. 6. Tr.</hi> 26. Ouer, and beside this, examining Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian, let vs aske him, what did Christ distribute to his disciples? Hee will answere <hi>panem,</hi> breade. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, howe made hee the breade his bodie? hee an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swereth, hee made it a figure of his bodie. Yea saieth Sander, the Sacrament is a figure of Christes bodie: because it sheweth his death vntill hee come.</p>
                  <p>But what is the sacrament with you Papistes? The naturall body of Christe. Then the naturall body of Christe, is a figure of the body of Christe: if this bee not shamelesse trifling, I report mee to you. Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian is a good expounder to interprete the name of <hi>Corpus,</hi> by <hi>figura Corporis,</hi> if <hi>Corpus</hi> bee taken pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly. But to proceede. The next reason to proue that Christ spake to the breade, is this: The Sacrament is a sacrifice, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> acte which offereth it, and voweth it, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teineth as well to the thing offered, as vnto God, to whom it is offered: as when a Lambe is offered, God in the Lambe is honoured, prayed vnto, blessed, thanked, and praysed. I omitte these straunge phrases: God is prayed to, in a Lambe. &amp;c. But speake plainely Sander, if thou darest: is the Lambe spoken vnto, when it is saide, This is the Passeouer: This is the bloude of the coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, which God hath made with you? For thou must not thinke, to reason with men in such sort, as boyes woulde not suffer thee to passe. The acte of sacrificing perteyneth to the thing offered: therefore the thing offered is spoken vnto. But howe prouest thou, that this Sacrament is a sacrifice? <hi>Because, it is the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of that great sacrifice, made by his death vpon the crosse, It must also needes partake that nature, whereof it is a remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance: and consequently, it must bee certainely beleeued, to bee
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:13044:223"/>
a true sacrifice, as that of the crosse was.</hi> Who will grant, or how canst thou proue, the <hi>maior</hi> of this argument, Euery remembrance must partake the nature of that, wherof it is a remembrance? Is the remembrance of a man, a man? or the remembrance of God, God? or to pose thee in thine owne popery, is the memory of a Masse, as you call it, a Masse? But that reason cannot proue, authority shall enforce. First Irenaeus lib. 5. <hi>ad Haereses</hi> saith, that when the bread broken and the mixed chalice <hi>percipis verbion dei,</hi> the eucharistie of the body &amp; bloud of Christ is made. The bread (saith Sander) cannot take the word, which is not directed to it. Yes, as well as all creatures are sanctified by the word of God, spoken by God to men, and by praier directed to God by men, and not to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> creatures y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> are eaten &amp; dronken. The same Irenae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us, is cited lib. 4. Cap. 34. saying, <q>
                        <hi>Panis percipiens vocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onem dei,</hi> bread receiuing the calling of God, is not now common bread, but the eucharistie consisting of two thinges, earthly and heauenly.</q> If vocation be not here taken for inuocation, or calling vpon God, as it is most like, yet at least, it is taken for the vertue of Gods word, which it may receiue, although the word be directed to men, and not to bread. But the earthly thing wherof the sacrament consisteth, (saith Sander) is the old forme of breade, as though accidents without the subiect and substance of earth, be earthly. Secondly the heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thing is the body of Christ: this is true, if he ment as Irenaeus meaneth, the body of Christ, the diuine vertue and efficacy of Christes body sacrificed, for our redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But as he vnderstandeth it, for the naturall body of Christ: like as it is monstrous to affirme that the form or shape of bread is an erthly matter: so is it here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall and anabaptisticall, to say, that the naturall body of Christ is an heauenly matter or substance.</p>
                  <p>The second authority is, <hi>Iustinus in Apol. 2. Cibu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> qui per verbum precationis, &amp;c. Wee haue learned that the foode which is consecrated by the worde of praier, which wee tooke of him, to be the fleshe and bloud of Iesus Christ.</hi> He yeldeth
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:13044:223"/>
the wordes of Iustinus, who interlaceth this Parenthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fis next to the worde, Foode, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, of which foode our bloude, and flesh by transmutation, are nourished: which confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth transubstantiation, and carnall eating. But to the matter in question. This worde of prayer (saith San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der) can bee none other, but, This is my bodie: as though Christ hath not taught vs to frame our prayers, but by that saying. But see the conclusion that will followe, admitting these wordes, This is my bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, to bee wordes of prayer: Then are they not wordes of performance: for prayer and performance differ as much as promise, and performance. Againe, when Sander saieth, they are not wordes of preaching, because they are wordes of prayer: <hi>for preaching is directed principally to the people, and prayer onely to GOD.</hi> Marke the conclusion. If they bee wordes of prayer, and wordes of prayer bee directed onely to God: then are they not directed to the bread.</p>
                  <p>The like may be gathered of that hee saieth, that they bee wordes of sacrifice, which were Idolatrie, to direct to any but to God: and therefore chargeth Caluine with horrible Idolatrie, for directing them to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, not remembring that it is as great Idolatrie, to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recte them to the breade, if they were wordes of sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice. But they are directed finallie to GOD (saieth hee) as though wordes of preaching, were not finallie directed to GOD: and by the way of sacrificing, they appertaine to the breade, as though wordes of sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing appertaine not to the people, for whome the sacrifice is offered, as much and more, then to the thing that is sacrificed. For what is a sacrifice of an Oxe, or a Calfe (of which hee taketh similitudes) but a figuratiue preaching?

                  <p>But Hierom <hi>ad Euag. tom.</hi> 2. sayeth, that at the prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of Priestes, the bodie and bloud of Christe is made. Doubtlesse at none other prayers (saieth San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der)
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:13044:224"/>
then wherein they saye, with minde of sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficing ouer breade, This is my bodie: &amp;c. seeing his argument is nothing else, but doubtlesse, wee may not doubt vppon it. A straunge prayer, wherein no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is asked, and hee that prayeth, speaketh not in his owne person, but in the person of another. But August. saith in Psal. 39. The performance of things promised, hath taken away y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> promising words, I wil giue, is a word of promise; I haue giuen, is a word of performance. The Eua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gelists testifie, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Christ hath giuen, therfore his words are not wordes of promise. I answere, The Euangelistes testifie, that Christ gaue bread, which he brake, and gaue vnto his disciples, promising the communicating of his body, to them that did eat it faithfully, in saying, this is my body which is broken for you: the condition of faithfull receiuing, required in all Gods couenantes, must needes be included in this, although in euery place where mention therof is made, it be not expressed.</p>
                  <p>From this matter, he returneth to the former talke of sacrifice. These wordes (saith he) fulfill the act of sacrifice, and therfore they are called of Iustinus Martyr <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> the worde of prayer, or vowe. It is false that he saith that Iustine calleth these words, This is my bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, wordes of praier, or vow: for he saith, the food to be <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, that for which thankes is giuen by worde of praier: yet Augustine saith Ep. 59. <hi>Vouentur, &amp;c. Al things are vowed which are offered to God, specially the oblation of the holy altar. And againe, Orationes. &amp;c. We take praiers to be saied, when that which is on the Lords table, is blessed and sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied and broken to be distributed.</hi> This blessing and sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (saith Sander) is made by praier, that praier is vow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to God of bread and wine: let all this be granted, what followeth? <hi>The word of vowing, is to say ouer it, This is my body.</hi> That is the matter in controuersie, which with Sander, is alwaies a good argument, but yet remaineth to be proued. But now we must see y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> difference betwen Caluine &amp; the old fathers. Augustine calleth the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment an oblation. Irenaeus li. 4. Ca. 32. witnesseth that Christ hauing taken bread and giuen thankes, said. This
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:13044:224"/>
is my body, and confessed the chalice to be his bloud, and taught a new oblation of the new testament, which also he prooueth out of Malachie the Prophet. Caluine will haue no working vpon the breade, but onely in the mindes of the hearers, and neither praier, nor vowe, nor sacrifice, in these wordes. Neither hath Sander prooued, that in these wordes, is either praier, vow, or sacrifice. Neuerthelesse, Caluine acknowledgeth, the celebration of the supper to be such an oblation as the fathers vnder stoode, namely a sacrifice of thankesgiuing, and not of attonement for sinnes. For thus writeth Irenaeus: <q>
                        <hi>Noui testamenti docuit oblationem quam ecclesia ab Apostolis accipiens, in vniuerso mundo offert deo, ei qui alimenta nobis praestat pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitias suorum munerum, &amp;c.</hi> He taught the oblation of the newe testament, which the Church receiuing from the Apostles, offereth to God through out the whole worlde, euen to him which giueth foode vnto vs, the first fruites of his giftes.</q> Here is no oblation of the body and bloud of Christ, but thanksgiuing vnto God for his benifites. And what the sacrifice foreshewed by Malachie was, he expoundeth out of S. Iohn, in the Apocalipse, the praiers of the saintes. Cap. 35. Also Cap. 34. expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding what is that pure sacrifice foreshewed by Malachie, and taught by Christ, he saith: <q>
                        <hi>Oportet enim nos oblationem deo facere, &amp; in omnibus gratos inueniri fabricatori deo, in senten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia pura, &amp; fide sine hypocrisi, in spe firma, in dilectione feruenti, primitias earum quae sunt eius creaturarum offerentes: &amp; hanc oblationem Ecclesia solapuram offert fabricatori, offerens ei cum gratiarum actione ex creatura eius.</hi> For we must make this oblation to God, and in all things be found thankefull to God our maker in a pure mynd, and faith without hypocrisie, in stedfast hope and feruent loue, offering the first fruites of those creatures which are his: and this pure oblation, the Church a lone offereth to her maker, offering to him of his owne creature, with thanksgiuing.</q> Thus writteth Irenaeus of the sacrifice of the Church, which cannot stand with the Popish sacrifice, of Christes naturall body and bloud.</p>
                  <p>And whatsoeuer Gregory Nyss. Chrysostome, or Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brose
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:13044:225"/>
write, of changing the bread, consecrating of the things set forth, working of Christes words, hath none other meaning, but of the spirituall changing, conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crating, and working of God, in the worthy receiuers of this sacrament, as in more proper places, shall be shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of euery one of them.</p>
                  <p>The next argument to prooue that Christe spake to the bread, is of the custom of the East Church, in which, the people answered Amen, when the words of conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration were pronounced alowde, which he proueth out of Ambrose. The same appeareth in Augustine <hi>sermone ad insants,</hi> which proueth, that it was the custome of the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine Church in those daies, to pronounce the words o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penlv: for Ambrose and Augustine were both of the West or Latine Church, and therefore the fecret whis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pering of the Popish Church, is prooued to be but new, in comparison, belike inuented since transubstantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion came to towne, and therefore that custome prooueth nothing worth the answering, howsoeuer Sander prefer it before the custome of the elder Church. To the which I answer, that Amen may be said, as well to wordes of promise, and more properly, then to wordes of perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance. For Amen, doth not only affirm a thing to be so, but also wisheth that it may be so.</p>
                  <p>But now, there is another ancient custome, witnessed by Irenaeus out of Euseb. lib. 5. Cap. 24. who reproouing Victor bishop of Rome, for exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>menicating the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of Asia, dissenting from him in the celebration of Easter, affirmeth that Soter, Anicetus, Pius, Higinus, Telesphorus, and Xystus, vsed solemnely to sende the Eucharisty to those preists, who came out of those quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, where Easter was kept otherwise then it was it Rome. <hi>Ergo</hi> (saith he) the sacrament is a corporall reall thing, which may be preserued, caried, sent vp and down, and so at last receiued. And so consequently, the wordes in question, are words of performance, and not of promise. Although the consequence is not sure, yet the foundation of this whole argument is nought. For
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:13044:225"/>
Irenaeus sayeth not, that the Sacrament was preserued, carryed, sent vp and downe, but that it was sent solemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vnto strangers, not into forreine countries, but to such as came to Rome, neither doeth hee saye, that it was sent vnto their lodginges or Innes, but for any thing that he sayeth, it was sent vnto them, beeing pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent at the time of distribution and celebration of the supper: for he sayeth before: <q>
                        <hi>Nunquam tamen ob hoc re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulsi sunt ab Ecclcsiae societate, aut venientes ab illis paribus non sunt suscepti.</hi> Yet were they neuer for this repulsed from the societie of the Church, or comming from those partes, were not receiued.</q> And afterwarde hee sheweth, that Anicetus did giue place vnto Polycarpus, permitting him to minister the Communion, as one whome he honoured. So that no reseruation, nor sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding vp and downe, is heereof prooued, other then sending the communion by the Deacons, about the Church, as their custome was. But Iustinus sayth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressely, that it was sent vnto them which were absent, by the Deacons, which had no power to consecrate, and therefore Caluine reprooueth that custome for an abuse.</p>
                  <p>But for as much as Iustinus maketh mention before of the collation of almes, which was also blessed, and that he affirmeth, that the Deacous carried it, is not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, but that this carriage might be of bread and wine, which was then offered in greate quantitie, to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe of such poore, as beeing letted by sicknesse or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisonment, coulde not be present, at the holy assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies. Or if you will needes vnderstande, that which was sent to be the sacrament, although the Deacons might not consecrate, yet might they declare the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and force of the consecration, and the vse of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, vnto such as they did carie it, from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, with which, those that vpon necessarie cause were absent, were present in spirite, &amp; might communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate more tollerably, then they which among y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Papists, when thei haue no let, refuse to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municate w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the priest,
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:13044:226"/>
and after in sicknesse receiue their masse cake, commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicating with none at all. Neuerthelesse, it cannot be denyed, but such carrying of the sacrament, if it were vsed in the eldest Church, was an abuse, because it hath none allowance in the holy Scriptures of Christes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution, but a commaundement to the contrarie: for these wordes, Take and eate, bee wordes of commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding: therefore keeping and sending, which are contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie to these, cannot be defended, howsoeuer they might be excused. Wherefore, it is without reason, that Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine is charged with intollerable pride, for finding fault with the primitiue Church, and bringing no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of his reprouing. For Caluine opposeth the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement of Christ, the end of the institution, which he worthily calleth the trueth, against any custome, of any man, how good soeuer he were. Cyprian sayeth, wee must not regarde what any man hath done before vs, but what Christ, which is before all, hath done and commanded to be done. lib. 2 Ep. 3. The custome of ministring with water, was ancient, and vsed in the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitiue Church, by some (as it should seeme by Cypri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an) otherwise godly men. But he concludeth against it, <q>
                        <hi>Neque hominis consuetudinem sequi oportet, sed Dei veritatem;</hi> Neither must we followe the custome of man, but the trueth of God.</q> It is therefore a fault, to keepe the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentall bread and wine, or to sende it about, because Christ hath neither done nor commanded it to be done, but the contrarie, to be eaten and dronken. This reason of Cyprian is Caluins reason, of whose writinges, San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der willeth all men to take heede: and yet he sayeth, they shall finde in them neither learning nor honestie. If there be no learning in them, there is no great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of hurt by reading of them. I marueile, what that is, which you Papistes call learning: for if it be know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of sciences, of tongues, of auncient writinges, of things past, of things present, weight in reasoning, elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence in vttering, power in reprouing, or whatsoeuer was in olde time accounted for learning, I trust al indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent men will confesse, that great steppes therof may
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:13044:226"/>
be found in Caluins writing. But if learning be nothing else with Papists, but that which they fantasie the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues to knowe, there is none learned but Papistes. Whereas Sander threatneth vpon the defence of Caluins supposed error, taken in hand by any of his scholers, to discouer more of the ignorance of their arrogant Master, if hee can haue so much leisure from his traiterous practises in Ireland, which he hath lately taken in hand, vnder the seruice of his diuelish blasphemous &amp; antichristian ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, the Pope, I wish him not to spare: not doubting, but as I haue so discouered his proude, and yet blockish ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, in this Chapter, in such sort as his friendes will blush to read it, although he be past shame himselfe: so in any matter, wherein the Church of England doth co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

But S. Iohn testifieth, that Iudas departed immediatly after the soppe receiued, which was before supper was ended. For this soppe could not be the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, (as Augustine thinketh) seeing the worde <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> signifieth a soppe dipped in brothe, and so was this soppe dipped in the platter, and not in the cuppe. But to admitte that Iudas was present, and did receiue the Sacrament; howe proueth hee, that hee receiued the bodie of Christe? That which Christe deliuered, Iudas receiued: Christ deliuered his body, <hi>ergo</hi> Iudas re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued his bodie. Neither the <hi>maior</hi> nor the <hi>minor</hi> of this argument, is out of controuersie. For Iudas recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued not whatsoeuer Christ deliuered: for Christ deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered a spirituall communication of his body, as Saint Paul witnesseth to them that woulde receiue it, which Iudas receiued not: therefore the <hi>maior</hi> is false. The <hi>minor</hi> taketh as graunted, that whereof is all the contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersie: namely, that Christ deliuered his bodie vnder the formes of bread, which we deny, affirming that hee gaue bread into their handes, and his bodie after a spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall manner, to them which receiued it by faith.</p>
                  <p>The Apologie further affirmeth, the Papists to teach the verie body of Christ to be eaten substantially, not onely of wicked men, but also (which is horrible to speake) of mise and dogges. Sander answereth, that it is not worthe the while to discusse, whether mise &amp; dogs, in some sense eate the body of Christ, because the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liks kepe it so warily, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> neither mouse nor dog may com nigh it: wherin he controlleth the scholemen, who haue long disputations &amp; doctorall determinations of that question. In the end he thinketh it worse, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> wicked men
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:13044:228"/>
shoulde eate, then if dogges or mise should eate it. But in deede they are both blasphemous absurdities. As for the fathers, whome he quoteth, for wicked mens eating of the body of Christ, we shal consider in the next Chapter, which is proper for that title. His next argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is out of S. Paul: whosoeuer shall eat this breade, and drinke this cupp of the Lorde vnworthily, shalbee guiltie of the bodie and bloud of the Lord. Of this text he reasoneth thus: vnworthie eating, supposeth an ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting. It is verie true: but Saint Paul calleth it eating of this bread, and not eating of this bodie. Yea, saith San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, Saint Paul doeth warily describe that kind of bread, both with an article and a Pronoune: <hi>ergo</hi> that breade is the bodie of Christ. I denie that argument. The article and the Pronoune, shewe that it is not common breade, but the sacrament of the bodie and bloud of Christ. But howe can hee which eateth this bread vnworthily, bee guiltie of the bodie of Christ, which he eateth not? Verie well. For he which abuseth the Kings seale, is guiltie of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> kings Maiestie, which he acknowledgeth not. But this argument out of Saint Paul, hee referreth vnto another time, returning againe to Iudas. That thinge whereof Christ saide to the twelue, Take, eate, and drinke, was taken, eaten, and dronken of all the twelue, and was but one thing onely concerning eating and drinking, that is his body and bloud: therefore Iudas did eat the same that Peter, Iames, and Iohn did.</p>
                  <p>Wee heard in the last Chapiter of the first booke, that it consisted of two things, by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> iudgement of Irenaeus, an earthly sub stance, and an heauenly, the one all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, the other onely the faithfull, therefore, the ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent of this argument is false. But if that argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be not plaine ynough, wee must take another. Iudas and Iohn did eate one thing: Eche of them, that foode, whereof Christe sayde, this is my body: but Iohn did truely eate Christes bodie: <hi>ergo</hi> Iudas did truely eate Christes body. I aunswere, the <hi>maior</hi> is ambiguous, for if one foode bee taken for one breade, it is true, but if one thing bee taken for the bodye of
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:13044:228"/>
Christ, it is the matter in controuersie, and denyed of vs. Likewise the <hi>Minor</hi> is ambiguous. For if ye vnderstande eating of Christs bodie truly, eating by faith spiritually, it is true, and as the Apologie meaneth: if you vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stande eating Christes bodie carnallie, it is false, and denyed of the Apologie, that Iohn did so eate the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die of Christ. The argument is no better then this: Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das and Iohn, did heare one Gospel each of them, that whereof it is saide, that it is the power of God to salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: But Iohn did heare the Gospel to his saluation: <hi>er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go</hi> Iudas did heare the Gospel to his saluation. But San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der cauelleth, of deliuering of bakers breade, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else, but Bakers breade. Christ offereth two thinges, earthly breade, and his diuine bodie. Nowe if Iudas receiue the one, and refuse the other, what folly is it to reason, of Christes deliuering? which is like as if a man will deliuer an obligation as his deede, and the partie that shoulde receiue it, will not receiue it, but as a scrolle, and so renteth it in peeces. In deede there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Christ offereth his bodie to all men: but they onely receiue it, which beleeue. But eating by faith, (saith Sander) is a preparation to worthie eating, but the meate is all one, euen as the baptisme is all one, to the wicked and to the godly. I will aske no better example, then of the Sacrament of Baptisme, where indeede, the water, which is the outwarde element, is common to all that are sprinkeled or washed, as the breade is to all that eate: but regeneration, the thing signified by the water, is proper onely to the electe of GOD: Euen so the bodie of Christ, which is the thing signified by the breade, is not receiued but of them, which beleeue vnto eternall life.</p>

The thirde father is Cypriane, <hi>de Coen. Domini. The sacraments for their part, cannot bee without their proper vertue, neither doth Gods maiesty by any meanes absent it selfe, from the mysteries. But albeit the sacraments permit themselues to be taken, or touched of vnworthie men, yet those men cannot bee partakers of the spirite, whose infidelitie or vnworthinesse withstandeth such holinesse.</hi> This authoritie is flatte a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Sander: the wicked may receiue the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes, but not the spirite of Christ, if not the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite, then not the bodie, for Christ his bodie, is neuer dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seuered from his spirite.</p>
                  <p>The fourth father is Hierome: but where, hee sheweth not. <hi>Opponis mihi, &amp;c.

The Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament is one in it selfe &amp;c.</hi> There is no question, but that the wicked are partakers of the Sacrament, which is called the bodie of Christe, but of the bodie of Christ in deede, they are not partakers. For it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, bee truely saide, of the naturall bodie of Christ, that it is made diuerse, but the Sacrament which is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led his bodie, is made diuerse, according to the faith or infidelitie of him that receiueth it.</p>
                  <p>Augustine is the fifte witnesse: <hi>In Epist. 162. To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerat &amp;c. Our Lorde him selfe beareth with Iudas, hee suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth a deuill, a thieefe, and the seller of himselfe, to receiue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the innocent disciples, that which the faithfull knowe, our price.</hi> Nothing is our price (saieth Sander) but the bodie of Christ. Yet may the Sacrament bee called our price, as it is called the bodie of Christ, for as touching that Iudas receiued not the same with the rest of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles, Augustine sheweth <hi>in Ioan. Tract. 59. Illi manduca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bant panem Dominum, ille panem domini contra dominum.</hi> They did eate that breade which was the Lorde, hee did eate the breade of the Lorde, against the Lord. What should I saye more, when Sander confesseth, that Saint Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine saith, <hi>de ciuitat. Dei lib. 21. Cap.</hi> 25. Euill men are
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:13044:230"/>

Not howsoeuer a man eate the flesh of Christ, and drinke the bloude of Christ, he abideth in Christ, and Christ in him: but by a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine kinde of way.</hi> As though S.

                  <p>The sixte witnesse is Gregorie, <hi>in prim. reg. libr. 2. C. 1. Salutis, &amp;c.

This doctrine, Sander confesseth to bee sounde and Catholike, but out of it, he will prooue the Popish reall presence, and that by two arguments.</p>
                  <p>The first reason is: Christ deliuered but one thing at each time, when he said, This, and This: The Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie confesseth, that hee deliuered his bodie and bloude: <hi>ergo</hi> hee deliuered neither breade nor wine, but in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, and his bodie and bloude onely in deede. I
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:13044:231"/>
denie the <hi>Maior,</hi> for vnto the faithfull (of whom the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pologie speaketh) he deliuered two thinges, of diuerse natures in one sacrament, or one thing consisting of two diuerse natures, the bread and wine corporally, his bodie and bloud spiritually, as Irenaeus saith. Neither is there such force in this, and this, but that one thing of diuerse natures, or two things in one mysterie, may be signified thereby. When God said: This is the passeouer, it were a madde conclusion to say, it were no Lambe, or, This is the newe Testament, therefore it is not his bloude: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause, <hi>This can bee but one thing:</hi> Yet 'Sander clappeth handes to his owne argument. <hi>O masters, trueth is straunge, and by the aduersaries owne weapon, getteth the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorie.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>His second reason is, <hi>When the bodie of Christ is truelie deliuered, it is deliuered according to the truth of his owne nature. The nature of a bodie, is to be deliuered after a bodily maner: ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the bodie of Christ is deliuered bodily.</hi> The <hi>Maior</hi> is false, for the bodie of Christ may be truely deliuered, when it is deliuered after a spiritual, and diuine maner. For in the saying of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Apologie, truely is contrarie to falsly, &amp; not to spiritually. And all the Papists confesse, that the body of Christ may be, &amp; must be eaten spiritually. Which of them dare say, the bodie of Christ is eaten falsely, when it is eaten spiritually, or not eaten, when it is eaten spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually, euen without the sacrament? Againe, if Sander like this <hi>Maior,</hi> I will thus inferre vpon it: When the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die of Christ is truely deliuered, it is deliuered accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the trueth of his owne nature: But the nature of a bodie is to occupie but one place at once, and that to fill with his owne quantitie, &amp;c. Therefore the bodie of Christ is so deliuered, as it occupieth but one place, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyneth quantitie, and all other things required in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of a true bodie. Finally, whereas Sander in the deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Apologie, misseth quickening of our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, but that he is disposed to play Momus, hee might haue founde that he misseth in the foode of immortali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, which toucheth our bodies as wel as our soules, and more properly.</p>

In proper forme of speech, this is false: for he had not his natural bodie, and bloud in his hands, but a sacrament thereof, which was a seale, and certaine perswasion vnto the faithfull, of the performance of his promise, which was the communicating of his body and bloude, which was performed after an heauenly, and spirituall manner.</p>

The wordes of the Apologie, are these: We doe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the Eucharist or the Lordes supper, to be a <note place="margin">Fulke.</note> sacrament, that is to say, an euident token of the body and bloud of Christ. This is to bring men from the word of God (saith he) to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> traditions of men. For where haue you in all the scripture, that the Lordes supper is a signe or token of the body and bloud of Christ, that is, a sacrament? And because these wordes are not found in the scriptures, from the beginning of the Genesis, vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> end of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Apocalipse; writen in so many letters, he fometh and fretteth like a mad dogg, against the authors of the Apologie, for going from the worde of God, to the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of men, Augustine and Ambrose, &amp;c. Then the which quarels, nothing can be inuented more foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish, or further from all witt, learning, and honesty. For when we appeale to the authority of the scriptures in all thinges, we neuer meant or saide, that all other wordes should be forsaken, which are not expressed in the bible; but that no doctrine is to be credited, by what terme so euer it be vttered, except the same be groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vpon the manifest sense and meaning of the holy scripture, either expressed in plaine wordes, or els ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered by necessary consequence. Therefore seing the meaning of the names of sacrament, signe, or token, may necessarily bee proued out of the holy scriptures, and for that cause haue ben taken vp and vsed, by the ancient fathers, in the primitiue Church, wee vse them as freely as they did, and as we vse other names likewise, the meaning of which, is plaine to be found in the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, although the termes them selues be not: as Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, persons, consubstantiall, &amp;c. If Sander durst deny the names of sacrament, signe, or token, to be agreable to the scriptures, I would take paines to prooue them: but seing he confesseth, that they are good and lawfull to be vsed of the supper of Christ, it were superfluous la bour to trauell in a needlesse question. Among the names, that are giuen to the Lordes supper, in the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: That the cupp is called The new testament in the bloud of Christ; and that of S.

<pb n="449" facs="tcp:13044:232"/>
spirituall meate and spirituall drinke (which last name Sander heaping vp the rest omitteth) it doth proue the names of sacrament, signe, and token, soe inuincibly, that we are no more afraide to vse them, then any of the other expressed in plaine wordes of the scripture. The name of sacrifice, which he enterlaceth by the way, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is afterward more at large discussed, I omit to write of, at this time.</p>

                  </argument>
                  <p>Seing the holy scripture preferreth not the one Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <note place="margin">Fulk.</note> aboue the other, and they are both a like effectual seales of the mercy of God to the saluation of his elect, there is no cause, why the Apologie shoulde acknowe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge such excellency of the one aboue the other, as Sander would imagine. But it is a matter of greate im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance with Sander, that Dionysius calleth it the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of Sacramentes, whereby it is not onely proued to be the worthier of the two, but also the chiefe of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Sacramentes.

be a Sacrament, a signe, and an euident token, of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die of Christ, Sander saith, it is constrained, to beleeue many vnwriten verities, and will not beleeue that only, which is written in the scripture, of this supper, that it is the body and bloud of Christ.</p>
                  <p>Beholde the vanitie of this fonde quareller, because these truethes are not expressed in so many Latine or English words in the scripture, therefore they be vnwrit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten verities. The froward man himselfe, in the Chapter last before confessed, that <hi>mysterium</hi> in the Greeke, was the same, that is called <hi>Sacramentum</hi> in Latine. If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lordes supper, be called in Greeke <hi>mysterium,</hi> we may find it in the scripture to be called a Sacrament. For where S. Paul saith: let a man thus esteeme vs, as the ministers of Christ, and as the dispensers of the mysteries of God: who doubteth but vnder the name of myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, the Lordes supper and baptisme is comprehended? although the name of mystery, be larger in Greke, then we vse the name of Sacrament in Englishe: yet in spight of the diuell, the name of mysterie and Sacrament, is truly verified out of the scripture of the Lordes supper and baptisme. Likewise the name of signe, being giuen by the holy ghost, vsually, to other Sacramentes, by analogie, must likewise apperteine to this Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. Ge. 17. Circumcision is called the signe of the couenant, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene God and the people. Likwise Exo. 12. the bloud of the Paschal Lambe, is called a signe, and S. Paul Ro. 4. calleth the signe of circumcision, a seale of iustifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</p>
                  <p>Last of all, hauing found in the scriptures, the Lords supper to be a Sacrament, signe, or seale; the argument of relatiues, leadeth vs by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hand, to cal it an euident signe, or token of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> body &amp; bloud of Christ, giuen for vs: for that is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> thing signified, which is proued by these words, This is my body, which is giuen for you, &amp;c.

<pb n="452" facs="tcp:13044:234"/>
whether the signe of the body, and the body it self may stande together or no? I answere him plainly, except he destroye the nature of things opposite, the signe and the thing signified, cannot stande together at one time, and in one respect: as it is vnpossible, that Abraham can be the father of Isaac, and the sonne of Isaac also. But in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerse respectes, they may stande together, as Abraham is the father of Isaac, and the sonne of Therah. So the bread and wine cannot be both the signe of Christes na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall bodie and bloud giuen for vs, and the verie same naturall bodie it selfe. But as it is a diuine mysterie, and heauenly seale, it is truely called that, whereof it maketh assurance, namely, the bodye and bloud of Christe, euen as the cuppe is called the newe testament, whereof it is a seale and assurance, and as baptisme is called regeneration, beeing a seale and assurance therof vnto the children of God.</p>

                     <p>That the supper of our Lorde, is both the signe of Christes bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, <note place="margin">Sander.</note> and also his true bodie, euen as it is a sacrament.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>He requireth diligent eare, as though he had founde out a great argument for his cause, when in deede, it o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthroweth <note place="margin">Fulk.</note> himselfe altogether. For he will shewe, that such a signe as belongeth to Christes institution, must needes haue the same trueth present, whereof it is the sacrament. Which being graunted, it prooueth no more the trueth present in the one sacrament, then in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other, seeing they belong both to the institution of Christ. But God and Christ (sayth he) cannot insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute a false signe or token. I say so also: and withall I say, that seeing God instituted all the Sacramentes of the olde Testament, which were signes and tokens of Christ, Christ was truely present in them, euen as true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as in our Sacramentes: and therefore Saint Paul tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth, that Our fathers did drinke of the same spirituall
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:13044:234"/>
drinke, that wee doe; for they dranke of the spirituall rocke, which rocke was Christ. If Sander coulde con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent himselfe with such trueth and presence of Christ, as he doeth exhibit in baptisme, and did exhibit in all the Sacraments of the olde testament, which were of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution, we might soone be agreed. But in the meane time, you see him ouerthrowen in his owne argument. Other matters, not incident to the present controuersie, I omitt, as <hi>that the holy ghost in baptisme, at the same instant doeth wash the soule from sinne,</hi> as though the effect of bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme extended no farther, then to the time of washing with water. Likewise, that <hi>the outward pronouncing of the wordes ouer the breade and wine, is the Sacrament.</hi> Whereby it followeth, that when the sound of the wordes is once past, it is no longer a Sacrament, and consequently, the Papistes must not call that which they worship, the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of the altar. &amp;c.</p>

                  <head>CAP. XI.</head>
                  <argument>
                     <p>What signe must chiefely be respected in the Sacrament of <note place="margin">Sander.</note> Christes supper, and what a Sacrament is.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>There be (if we beleeue Sander) foure kinde of signes <note place="margin">Fulk.</note> in the Sacrament of the altar. The first be tokens ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king &amp; consecrating the Eucharist, which are the words of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>secratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: the second, be signes of it made, which are the accidents of bread &amp; wine. The third, a signification of the Church. And the fourth eating, is a signe of a meruailous banket in the life to come. Of these foure, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> first must be chiefly respected, which is an outward toke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of an inward trueth: the outward token, is called the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament: the inward trueth is called the thing of the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, wherupon the diffinition of a sacrament allea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by Gratian out of S. Augustine, is this: A Sacrament is the visible forme of inuisible grace. Out of this diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition, which imployeth two partes of a Sacrament, he wil proue the trueth of the reall presence: for if the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die be not present (saith he) the words make a false toke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:13044:235"/>
I denie the consequence, for the wordes make a true to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and yet the body is not present, after his grosse ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination of bodily manner of presence. His exemplifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the order of priesthood, giuen to the Apostles by these words, <hi>Hoc facite,</hi> doe and make this, is to make a proofe of one controuersie by another. For we denie the power of making, which he pretendeth there to be giuen, affirming, that it is a commandement to continue that sacrament of his institution, and shewing the vse thereof.</p>
                  <p>His second argument is, that Christ spake not figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuely, because a figuratiue speach can signifie no cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine thing, vntil it be plainly vnderstanded. This I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie: for a figuratiue speache may signifie one certeine thing, which the speaker meaneth, although the hearer vnderstand it not at all. Howbeit that which Christ did here speake figuratiuely, was easily vnderstood of all his hearers, which were well accustomed to such kinde of speaches. But Sander replyeth, that the Apostles were simple men &amp; Idiots, and vnderstood not the scriptures: therefore they could not vnderstand how y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> signe might be called by the name of the thing. I answere, although they were simple vnlearned men in deede, and such as vnderstood not the scriptures, in such full measure as was necessarie for them to discharge so great an office, as was laid vpon them: yet Sander doth them too much wrong, to make them, or any godly person of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> time, so ignorant in the scriptures, that they vnderstoode not the nature of a Sacrament, considering they were circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, &amp; did celebrate the Passeouer euery yere, the verie name wherof must needes teach them, howe the signe may be called by the thing signified. And therfore it is out of measure ridiculous &amp; foolish, that Sander prateth of the true &amp; first meaning of the wordes of Christ. For what will the vaine iangler make to be the true and first meaning of these wordes of Christ, This cupp is the newe Testament? What verifying of contradictories, what diuers soundings? what true tokens, what things present? O great diuinitie of Popish doctors.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="455" facs="tcp:13044:235"/>
But the Apologie is confuted by his owne saying, when he calleth the Eucharist an euident token of the bodie and bloud: if it be euident (saith he,) it is quickly vnderstood. Call women and children, and aske them what token the wordes of Christ make. Nay, rather call Turkes &amp; Sarazens, and aske the question, if it must be euident to them vnto whome the mysterie is not reuea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led. The token is euident to them that are instructed, not to such as neuer heard of it, as belike, where Sander hath to do, women and children are. But God be than<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, women and children instructed in the Church of Christ, can tell him howe euident a token it is, of their spirituall feeding, on the bodie and bloud of Christ.</p>
                  <p>But that wordes must be taken as they commonly sound, he will proue by the institution of the sacrament of Penance, as he termeth it, Whose sinnes you forgiue, they are forgiuen, &amp;c. where, as much is giuen, as is signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the wordes. If this be true, all cases reserued, both episcopall and Papall, are in case to bee forgiuen, by euery priest of the lowest degree. But here the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie, which denyeth the Sacrament of Penance, is char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to haue falsified the wordes of Christ, saying, they are meant, whose sinnes you declare to be forgiuen. If the Apologie doe not truely expound the wordes of Christe, yet doeth it not falsifie them, except Sander will saye, that euerie wrong exposition is a falsificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Howe Christes wordes are to be taken, as San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der will not dispute in this place, so neither will I stande here to discusse. But this is a bolde determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of him, that many wordes may signifie vnpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly in other places, but the principall wordes of a Sacrament, cannot be vnproper. For the nature of the thing, doeth limit the interpretation of the wordes. If this doctorall determination be true, then these are proper speaches, The rocke is Christ, the Lambe is the Passeouer: the cuppe is the newe Testament, baptisme is the lauer of regeneration.</p>
                  <p>And S. Augustines rule, <hi>De doct, Christ, lib. 3. Ca.</hi> 16. must giue place to D. Sanders decree: <hi>Si autem flagi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

If the words of scripture seeme to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunde any wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked nor vngodly acte, or to forbid any profit or well doing, it is a figure: Except ye shall eate (saith he) the flesh of the sonne of man, and drinke his bloud, you shal haue no life in you, it seemeth to commande a wicked or heinous act. Therfore it is a figure, commanding vs to communicate with the Lordes passion, and profitable to kepe in remembrance, that his flesh was crucified and wounded for vs. Againe, <hi>Locut. de Gen. lib. 1. fol. 72. Tres fundi tres dies sunt, no<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> dixit tres dies significa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. Et multu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> haec lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutio notanda est, vbi aliqua significantia earum rerum quas sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificant nomine appellantur.

And this kind of speech is much to be marked where any signifying thinges, are called by the names of those thinges which they doe signifie. Hereof it is, that the Apostle saieth, And the rocke was Christ, hee saith not, the Rocke did signifie Christ.</p>
                  <p>Finally, where Sander saieth, it is against the nature of a Sacrament, not to signifie plainly, I agree with him, affirming that the bread and wine, which is eaten and dronken, doe plainly signifie, that we are fed spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, with the very body and bloud of Christ, vnto the full assurance of our perseuerance, &amp; continuance in the fauour of God, euen vntill we be put in possession of eternall life, and the wordes in this Sacrament, be as plaine as in the other, but the diuell to aduance the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Antichrist, hath deuised a monstrous interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of them, to make a most abhominable Idoll of desolation of the most holy and comfortable sacrament of Christes death and passion.</p>

                  <argument>
                     <p>Which argument is more agreeable to the word of God: it is <note place="margin">Sander.</note> a token of the body, made by Christ, and therefore not the body, or els, therefore it is the true body of Christ.</p>

                     <pb n="457" facs="tcp:13044:236"/>
Sander, to dispute for his life, would take the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion <note place="margin">Fulk.</note> thus: it is a signe of his body, therfore it is his bodie in deed. So that Sander to dispute for his life, would o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthrow the nature of opposites, which cannot stande both together at one time, and in one respect. But as though Logike were contrarie to the word of God, hee will haue the argument tryed by the word of God. And first he reiecteth the Sacramentes instituted before the incarnation of Christ, which he saith, were signes in part emptie and voide of the trueth, which they signified, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause trueth is made by Iesus Christ. As though Iesus Christ concerning the trueth of doctrine, and the grace of saluation, were not yesterday and to day the same, &amp; for euermore, the Lambe slaine from the beginning of the worlde, Hebr. 13. Apocalipse. 13. Secondly, hee bringeth examples of the Angell speaking to Marie of Christe, speaking to the leprous man, to him that had the palsie, to the disciples of Iohn baptist, to the dumme man; to proue, <hi>that when at the doing of any thing, an outward signe of an inwarde grace is rehearsed, that which the signe soundeth, the grace worketh.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When Sander shal dispute for his life, he must chuse him an easye aduersary, for els he will soone loose his life, for lacke of good argumentes, if he escape hanging, drawing, and quartering for treason. Except he thinke there be any children among vs, brought vp in their Catechisme, that bee so ignorant, to thinke the wordes of Christ intending to worke a particular miracle, be signes &amp; Sacraments, in the same nature, that bread &amp; wine is, being apointed by him, to be an ordinary pledg &amp; assurance of his grace, vnto his whole church. Againe, we deny, that the wordes of Christ are the Sacrament, but wee say with Augustine: <hi>Accedat verbum ad elemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum:</hi> Let the worde come to the element, and then it is made a Sacrament. Last of all, concerning the trueth of Christes wordes: This is my bodie: This cuppe is the Newe testament, &amp;c. wee nothing doubt, but that grace in Gods elect, worketh that which the wordes soun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, according to the true meaning of them.</p>

                     <pb n="458" facs="tcp:13044:237"/>
But if Sander could haue made his matter good, hee should haue reasoned of the water of baptism, which is a signe of regeneration, and if he could proue, that the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in baptisme is not water, but regeneration in deede, because it is a token of regeneration, he should haue reasoned somewhat like, for his life. But that which he saith of doing or making, he would not haue it wrested to the meere doctrine of Christ, which he spake doing or making nothing: for therein he vsed parables, but Christ (saith he) did, rather then taught in his supper; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, his wordes must be vnderstood euen as they sound. If this rule be true, Christ dranke and gaue wine at his supper, which is the fruite of the vine, according to the sounde of the wordes, and therefore no transubstantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the cuppe. But where he saith, that Christ did, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then taught at his supper, he would haue vs thinke, belike, that Christ did celebrate his supper, like the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish Masse, in which is much adoe, &amp; no teaching at all. But beside that, all the three Euangelists, do set forth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs, the summe of his doctrine. S. Iohn doeth in foure Chapters, from the 13. to the 18. describe at large, that he was occupied in teaching rather then doing. You haue heard how Sander would dispute for his life.</p>

<pb n="460" facs="tcp:13044:238"/>
figure of Rhetorike as <hi>Metonymia,</hi> or <hi>Synecdoche,</hi> and not a sacramentall token. No, master Sander, they were not so young Grammarians, or Rhetoricians, as you woulde beare fooles in hand, but they could vnderstand the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of a rhetoricall, and a sacramentall figure, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they coulde tell that a rhetoricall figure is vsed, when a sacramentall token is spoken off, as in so manie examples of the scripture, they haue shewed. But nowe let vs see, what maine argument you haue, to prooue that the supper is no sacrament, if the wordes (This is my bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, &amp;c.) be figuratiue. The words, saie you, doe not sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie a figure of his bodie, therfore either they worke his bodie, or they make nothing at al. I answere w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Tertull. &amp; August. The words do signifie a figure of his body. For so do they expound y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> words. This is my body, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is to say, a figure or signe of my body, which their expositio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, were false, except those wordes This is my body, doe signifie a figure or signe of his bodie. Therefore Master Sander, you may teach boies, that bodie signifieth a substance and not a figure. Tertullian and Augustine will not not be so aunswered at your handes. They tell you that the interpretation of Christes wordes is such, as proueth his speach to be figuratiue, in spight of your heart. And that euery boye, that readeth this chapter, may laugh at your arrogant impudence, I set downe once againe these words of Christ: This cuppe is the newe Testament in my bloud, which if they be not confessed of you, to bee figuratiue, you will not confesse that fire is hote, nor water moyst: If they be figuratiue, what Sacrament will be made with them? Where you tell vs, that the bodie of Christ vnder the formes of bread and wine, is a figure of the same bodie walking on earth, suffering on the crosse, or sitting in heauen, you doe as much, as if you woulde teach vs, that Abraham sitting close in his tent, so that no man coulde see him, was father of the same Abraham him selfe, as he was the sonne Therah, &amp; came with him out of Vr of the Chaldees, and as hee begate Isaac in the lande of Canaan, and as hee is nowe at rest with God in heauen. When you can perswade vs, I saye,
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:13044:238"/>
that one man can be father and sonne of himselfe, then wil we beleeue you, that a figure, and the thing figured, be all one.</p>

Tush (saith Sander) <hi>all other wayes of setting the death, resurrection and conuersation of Christ before our eyes, without the reall presence, is painting and sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowing in comparing of this liuely representation.</hi> If this be true preaching of the death of Christ, by which he is euen cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified among vs, as S.

And yet Chrysostome (if euer hee haue such a context) nameth not the bodie, but the mysteries. It is one thing to receiue the mysteries, another thing to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the bodie in such manner as the Papistes doe teach. And Chrysostome vsing the same wordes, but not in such context, <hi>ad Pop. Antiochen. Hom.</hi> 21. hath also <hi>linguam sanguine tali purpuratam, &amp; factam aureum gladium,</hi> the tongue dyed purple with such bloude, and made a golden sworde. Likewise the eyes, by whiche thou hast seene the secretes and dreadfull mysteries: which sayings doe shewe, that hee spake not of a bodily pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, or receiuing, but of a spirituall receipt and faith, by which wee see Christe present, and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge our tongue to bee dyed purple with his bloude, and to be made a golden sworde, which is not done cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porally, but spiritually.</p>
                  <p>The last argument is, that the Lordes supper hath beene of olde time called the Sacrament of the Altar, by which (saieth hee) wee are informed, that the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice is made vpon a visible Altar, or table, and so S.

The argument of the resurrection of our bodies, which Irenaeus, Tertullian, and Cyril doe gather of receiuing of the Sacrament, is from the signe to the thing signified: and therefore Tertullian maketh y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same argument, from the washing of baptisme, and from other ceremonies of annoynting, signing, and laying on of hands, <q>

Of the two natures in one person Christe, there neede to bee no question, but that Sander, by telling what Scriptures are proper to both the natures, woulde by authoritie of one Saint Germanus, I cannot tell whence hee came (for the Louanistes are greate coyners of antiquities) teach vs that these wordes of Christe, Matth. 28. Behold I am with you to the ende of the worlde, may be meant as well by the nature of manhoode, which wee haue with his godhead in the Sacrament, as by the onely nature of the Godheade: and that in this place of Matth. 26. The poore you shall haue alwayes with you, mee yee shall not haue alwayes. By the worde Mee, hee meaneth not his Godheade, but the nature of his manhoode, as it was when hee spake in a visible forme of a poore man, but not as it is in the Sacrament.

Yes (saith Sander) for that redemptio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>which was wrought by his flesh and bloud, is applied to all that bee of a lawfull age, by worthye eating and drinking therof. But where hath he that exception of them that be of lawefull age, or that eate it worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly? Christ speaketh generally and absolutely, of both. And why should we thinke, there is any other meane to apply the redemptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> purchased by the fleshe and bloud of Christ for vs, then was for the fathers, as before Christ came in the flesh? Faith was the onely meane vnto them, and the Sacraments were the seales of their faith: What other meanes need we to atteine to the same saluation? He saith, when the flesh of Christ was crucified, the soul of Christ deliuered the soule of Abraham and all the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fathers out of prison. But where findeth he, that Abraham and the fathers were in prison, vntill that time. We find before that time, that Abraha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was in so happy estate, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> his bosom was a receptacle of comfort for al his faithfull children. Luc. 16.</p>
                  <p>But to end the matter so euill fauouredly begunne, Sander saieth, that <hi>Christ to shew that he would be in his supper by the nature of his manhoode, for that cause named not his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, but his flesh, his body, his bloud; and Saint Paul nameth; his

For euery man may eate bread and drinke wine, at his owne house, with his wife and children, and remember that Christ died for them, neither will Christ leaue his good deuotion vnrewarded, wherein the supper that you assigne to Christ, consisteth and is fulfilled.</hi> Beside the shamelesse slander, that our supper is fulfilled in such a priuate pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptuous acte, marke how he alloweth, the sacrilegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous arrogance of him, 'that should vsurp (if any were so madde to doe, as he is to imagine) such a ridiculous counterfeting and mocking of Christes institution: hee doth assure him that Christ will not leaue his good de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion vnrewarded. But this is but a cold assurance. Like as it is but a cold preparation, which is made by transubstantiation, whereby after so greate broiling, rosting, and saucing, to compasse such cookery as Sander taught vs in the first booke Cap. 4. such a presence is wrought, as maketh the body of Christ none otherwise present to a faithfull man, then to an infidel, than to a dog, a cat or a rat.

And whereas Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostome and Cyrill, as we heard before, saide that Christ giueth his flesh to be touched, they speake improperly, and meane a touching by the mouth of faith, like as they affirme also, that he giueth himselfe to be seene, which is not but with the eye of faith. And it is strange, that Sander dare not as well say, We see him, as, we may see him, vnder the forme of breade: as that wee touche him vnder the forme of bread: but the matter is, that then he shoulde destroy his doubtie distinction of the bodily presence visible and inuisible. Although Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rillus, as is shewed before, affirmeth that Christ is visibly present in the sacrament of his body. Touching by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe, Sander will not deny at length, although in the beginning, he marueiled how touching could be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the mouth &amp; teeth, but that touching by beliefe, he sayeth, is furthered by touching that visibly, wherein we beleeue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> flesh of Christ to be inuisibly.

If Christ be giuen vs (sayeth Sander) in these mysteries, he is present in them: for a gift is not made of a thing absent. Yes, Master Sander, if the Prince at Westminster, giue a manor lying in Yorkeshire by letters patents, the Patentee which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiueth his Patent at Westminster, hath the manor true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly giuen vnto him, which is in Yorkeshire. Therefore, a gift by sufficient assurance, may be of a thing absent in nature thereof: and so is Christes body giuen vs in the mysteries, which are the seale of Gods promise, truely giuing Christes body vnto vs, which according to the naturall and corporal manner of presence, is in heauen, and not on the earth. Col. 3. But Sander woulde vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stande howe wee knowe, that wee are flesh of his flesh, and bone of his bones, except it be by the reall &amp; cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall presence of Christ in the mysteries? Yes for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sooth, wee knowe it by the worde of God, which so te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifieth, Eph. 5. and by the spirite of Christ which dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth in vs, Rom. 8. and last of all, we haue assurance ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of by the holy sacrament, as by a seale, confirmation, and pledge of the perfourmance of Gods promises vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs.</p>
                  <p>But a coniunction betwixt the flesh of Christ, &amp; the
<pb n="479" facs="tcp:13044:247"/>
flesh of men, cannot be made (saith he) by faith, spirite, and vnderstanding. As man and wife cannot become one flesh by consent of mariage, except in deede they come bodily togither. Yes sir, wee holde, that Christ is actually ioyned to the nature of man, by his incarnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but this coniunction profiteth not all men, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly them to whome he is ioyned, by spirite, faith, &amp; vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding: and so the incarnation of Christ, made all the fathers of the olde testament, flesh of his flesh, and bone of his bone. For otherwise, it is the spirite that quickeneth, the flesh prositeth nothing. What auaileth it the reprobate, that God is become man, ioyned in the same substance of fleshe, bloud and bones, and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane soule? Nothing: because they lacke the spirite of Christ and faith.</p>
                  <p>Last of all, where he saith, that man &amp; wise cannot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come one flesh without carnal copulation, it is a beast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly opinion. For he that sayde, they shall bee two in one flesh, spake of the holy coniunction of two per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons in mariage, according to Gods institution, before carnall copulation, by which, the acte of generation is sanctified, and the bed made to bee vndefiled, not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straining the coniunction to the coupling of their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies. For the Scripture called Ioseph and Marie, hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band and wife, although there were no comming toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of their bodies. And howe can the Papistes affirme Matrimonie to be a sacrament, when the coniunction in one flesh, which is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> effect thereof, cannot be wrought by the worde of God, but is left in the choise of the man and the woman? Last of all, where Sander saith, there is no other meanes taught in the Gospell, howe Christ may be present in flesh, or his flesh ioyned to our flesh, but by meanes of transubstantiation, it will fall out, that seeing transubstantiation is not taught in the Gospell, neither was thought vpon sixe hundred yeares in the Church, but the contrarie manifestly proued, that Christ is not present in flesh at all, nor his flesh shoulde be ioyned to our flesh by any meanes.

                     <p>The contrarietie of the Apologie is shewed, and that the lifting vp of our heartes to heauen, is no good cause why we should lift <note place="margin">Sander.</note> the bodie of Christ from the altar.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>First he chargeth vs with great forgetfulnesse. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde <note place="margin">Fulke.</note> to make a shewe of contrarietie, he falsifieth most impudently the wordes of the Apologie, which he ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted himselfe in the Chapter last before. <hi>Christ giueth him selfe present in these mysteries, &amp;c. therefore he is not here, but in heauen, feeding vs from thence.</hi> This worde, Present, hee nowe addeth, which because he missed before, he would seeme to proue it by reason. Shall I saye, who euer had to doe with such a forgetfull man, or rather, with so shamelesse an heretike? Although the Apologie neuer denyeth simply the presence of Christ in the mysteries, but alwayes, that manner of presence, which the papists affirme, and is now in controuersie betweene vs.</p>
                  <p>That the exhortation to lift vp mens heartes, is no good argument to proue that Christ is onely in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, he vseth much foolish babling, as though that say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing onely were brought for an argument, or that saying of it selfe for a sufficient argument, or that saying for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny argument. But where the Scripture sayth, that Christ after his ascension, concerning his humanitie, hath left the worlde, Ioan. 16. (which the Apostles vnderstood to be spoken plainly, and without all parable) and that he sitteth in heauen, and not on earth, Col. 3. the Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie sayth, this is the cause why the people are exhorted to lift vp their heartes: and not as Sander peruerteth it, because the people are exhorted to lift vp their heartes, therefore Christ is not present in his mysteries.</p>
                  <p>But lifting vp of heartes with the olde fathers, was to acknowledge the mysteries vpon the table, to beleeue the sacrifice of the Masse, and not to denye the reall presence of Christ, saith Sander. Doe you not looke for some sound argument, to proue this geare, especially of
<pb n="481" facs="tcp:13044:248"/>
him which immediatly before, charged the author of the Apologie, to vse an argument more like a tinker, than a diuine? you shall heare his argument of authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Chrysostom, <hi>Hom. de Eucharistia. Diddest thou not promise the Preist, when he cried, Lift vp your minds and hearts: and saiedst thou not: we lift them vp vnto our Lord? Will you see a wonderfull matter? The table is furnished with the myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. The lambe of God is offered for thee, the Priest is hofull for thee, a spirituall fire floweth from the table.</hi> Loe here be the mysteries vppon the table, heere is the lambe of God offered which is the sacrifice of the Masse. But I pray you sir, what is the spirituall fire that floweth from the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble? O that is a figuratiue speech, you will say, alluding to the burned offering of the old law. Nay, if ye haue fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures of rhetorike, then you haue no trueth, you haue but foolish dreames, you haue nothing made by your wordes.

                  <p>Heere Sander choppeth of: but Cyrill proceedeth: <q>And doest thou attempt to handle by humaine cogita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions those thinges which are receiued, by onely pure and vncurious or simple faith? For seeing the nature of the Godhead is not eaten, for this cause shall any man say that the holy body of our Lord is a common body? But it is profitable for vs to knowe, that as we saide before, the body of that worde which quickeneth all thinges, is a proper body. And seing it is the body of life, it is of power to quicken. For by this it giueth life vnto our mortall bodies, and doeth make voide the power of death, and in equall manner the holy spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite of Christ doeth quicken vs. For it is the spirite that quickneth, according to the saying of the same our Sauiour.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus farre Cyrillus, whose words doe plainly shewe that he calleth all those grosse and humane cogitations, by which it is saide, that Christ, is eaten in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as a naturall man, and any otherwise receiued then only by faith. Such are the imaginations of the Papistes, that Christ is eaten carnally, euen without efficacy of his spirite, that he is included vnder the formes of bread and wine, that he is receiued with the mouth, pressed with the teeth, swallowed with the
<pb n="483" facs="tcp:13044:249"/>
throte, essentially &amp; naturally turned into the substance of our bodies, or our bodies turned into him, and an hundreth other such grosse cogitations, as the Papistes haue of digestion, corruption of the accidentes, eating of the Sacrament by brute beastes, these be grosse ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations, of which Cyrillus speaketh, that tende ad <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, to the eating of a man, or to any kinde of eating the flesh of Christ, other then by faith only. And therefore Sander might haue spared his paines in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting tenne other grosse imaginations.</p>
                  <p>The first, that wee should not imagine Christ to lie, where he saith, it is his bodie, as though we did ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine any such blasphemy.</p>
                  <p>The second, that wee should not imagine his saying to be darke or obscure, when Cyrillus <hi>ad Calosyrium</hi> saith, <hi>Eo manifestè dicente,</hi> sith himselfe saith mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festly. Although wee doe not imagine his wordes to be obscure, yet this is a grosse argument, to prooue that his wordes be not figuratiue, because Cyrill writeth he saith manifestly, that is, it is manifest that he call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the bread his body, for he saith as manifestly, this cuppe is the newe Testament.</p>
                  <p>The third grosse imagination, that wee should not thinke any other body to be eaten, but the true body of Christ, who in one person is God and man, as Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storius thought that the body of a man was eaten, but not the proper body of God the worde. We imagine no such matter, but wee denie that true body to be eaten in the Sacrament otherwise then by faith onely, as Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rillus teacheth vs.</p>
                  <p>The fourth grosse imagination, that wee should eate the body of Christ dead, and passible, whereas it is quicke and of power to quicken vs, as Cyrill saith, <hi>Quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niam, &amp;c: Because the flesh of our sauiour ioyned to the word of God, which is life naturally, is made able to giue life, when wee eate it, then wee haue life in vs, being ioyned to that flesh which is made life.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="484" facs="tcp:13044:250"/>
According to this saying of Cyrillus, wee beleue, that we cannot eate that flesh, except wee haue life thereby, but the Papistes grossely imagine, it may be eaten with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out effect of life. The fift grosse imagination, that we should eate Christes flesh rawe, as the Capernaits: &amp; as grossely do they imagine, which teach, that it is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with such cookerie, that all spices, confection, sau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, &amp;c. are conteined in it, as Sander doeth. The sixt grosse imagination, that it shoulde be eaten by peeces, one a shoulder, and another a legg, against which eating Saint Augustine speaketh. And as grosse it is to imagine and meere monstrous, that the naturall bodie should be eaten after a corporall manner, whole of euery men, and in so many places at once. The seuenth grosse imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation is, of the Lutherans, which thinke the flesh of Christ is eaten with bakers breade, whereas Christe woulde not haue in his supper an earthly substance of materiall breade. More grosse is the imagination of the Papistes, which holde, that the glorious bodie of Christ must be eaten with vaine accidents of bread and wine, which Sander calleth the veiles and curteines, to co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Was the presence of Christ in the Sacrament, another manner of presence, then that presence which the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles behelde with their eyes sitting before them? Yea, it was a glorious and mysticall presence. If you coulde holde you there, wee shoulde soone bee agreed. The eight, is to confesse the reall presence, and to denye ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, let them answere, that defende such presence.

Againe, here also in the holy table, let vs not basely attende the breade and cuppe set before vs, but lifting vp our minde, let vs vnderstand by faith: That Lambe of God which taketh away the sinnes of the worlde, to be set on that holy table, to be vnbloudily sacrificed of the priestes, and that we true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taking his owne preciou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>e not much but litle, that we may knowe we take not to fill vs, but for holines.</hi> Out of these wordes, ten argumentes he hath, to prooue, or <hi>to helpe to prooue,</hi> the reall presence of Christes body vnder the formes of bread and wine.</p>
                  <p>The first is, that bread and wine are set on the table, not to be basely considered, <hi>ergo</hi> they are changed into the body and bloud of Christ. This is a poore, and a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorne helpe, and a miserable argument. For the contrary doth followe, the bread must not be basely considered,
<pb n="486" facs="tcp:13044:251"/>
                     <hi>ergo</hi> it is breade, although it be highly considered and regarded as the water in baptisme.</p>
                  <p>The second argument, is, that seeing the wordes of consecration be past (in respect of which, the Councell sayeth, the breade and wine must not be basely consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered) the wordes did not onely make them a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as in baptisme, &amp;c. but also did worke some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all thing vnder the formes of bread and wine, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth still, as long as the saide formes and signes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine. Nay rather, the Councell signifieth, that the celebration of the Sacrament and consecration thereof, is not perfite, before the vse and receite of it: whereof it speaketh soone after, and therefore is not to be base<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly considered, as common breade and wine, but san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified to a special vse of an holy Sacrament and pledge of our redemption: as for the formes, and signes, and colours of breade and wine, the Councell speaketh not one worde of them, but of bread and the cuppe, which be substances, and not accidental formes.</p>
                  <p>The thirde, We must vnderstand (saith hee) not by seeing, but by lifting vp our mindes to heauen by faith. In deede, that is the onely waye to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stande the mysticall presence of Christes body &amp; bloud in the Sacrament.</p>
                  <p>The fourth, We must beleeue, that to be the Lambe of God, which is on the holy table, whereon standeth that which seemeth breade and wine. But the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell speaketh not of that which seemeth, but of that which is breade and wine, and that by lifting vp of our mindes into heauen, by faith, Wee beleeue it to be the bodie and bloud of Christ.</p>
                  <p>The fifth, The Lambe is there so, that he is put, laide, and situate there, as a thing may be situate, which is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the formes of another thing. But if a man should aske you, howe that may bee? I marueile by what thing you woulde exemplifie it, and yet your wordes import a fimilitude. Therefore seeing it is without
<pb n="487" facs="tcp:13044:251"/>
example, your position is after an imagined man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. Whereas the Councell neuer thought of anye such quiditie, but that lifting vp our mindes into hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen by faith, wee vnderstande that Christ is dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed vnto vs, by his holye mysteries, as wee are incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porated to him by baptisme, not that one thing is situated as another thing, which is no where, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther any such thing can bee shewed, and therefore is nothing, but an ydle toye of an euill occupyed brayne.</p>
                  <p>The sixt, The Lambe is so truely made present, that hee is outwardly offered of the Priestes, vnbloudily. Where haue you the worde, outwardly, or what ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument haue you of an outwarde oblation, except you thinke Priestes cannot offer, but outwardly? Naye, rather in that the Councel sayth, the Lamb is offered vnbloudily, it signifieth, that it is not offered for a propitiatorie sacrifice, to take away sinnes, for with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out shedding of bloud, there is no sacrifice for sinnes, Hebr. 9. but that a remembrance of that onely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sacrificable sacrifice of Christe, is celebrated in that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly action.</p>
                  <p>The seuenth, After the sacrifice made, the people doe partake with the altar, which could not bee, except a permanent substance were made by consecration. The Councell speaketh not of partaking with the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, but of receiuing the body and bloud of Christ, in the mysticall tokens of our redemption, which ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throweth priuate Masse, Communion in one kinde, and transubstantiation, and sheweth the Sacrament not to be perfite, before it be receiued.</p>
                  <p>The eight, Truely taking of the precious body and bloud of Christ, is to take it really and bodily. The Councell speaketh of no bodily taking, but of ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king by faith, when wee beleeue the breade and wine to bee the mysticall tokens of our redemption, wee truely take the precious bodye and bloude of Christ.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="488" facs="tcp:13044:252"/>
The ninth, taking of that which standeth before vs on the table, is by the instrument of our bodies: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is deliuered by the corporall ministerie of the priestes, so that all is truely and externally done by the iudgement of the Councell. A shamelesse collection of a false argument. For that which standeth on the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, the Councell calleth breade, and the cuppe, which is taken and deliuered externally, and by corporall instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, the rest must be vnderstoode by faith, which is not of externall things, but of things inuisible.</p>
                  <p>The tenth, we truely taking them, beleeue them to be the tokens of our redemption, or as some read, resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection: for bread &amp; wine be not tokens of our redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Did bread and wine redeeme vs? or did they rise from death, quoth Sander? No verily: But the Councell saith for all that: that these things which are set on the table, namely, bread and the cupp, are beleeued of vs to be the mysticall tokens of our redemption, which the wordes following do declare. <hi>For this cause wee take not much, but litle, that we might knowe we take not to fill vs, but for holinesse.</hi> What can that be, whereof, not much but a litle is taken, but the breade and wine? for the body &amp; bloud of Christ, is not taken in quantitie more or lesse. Secondly, what neede wee by taking litle, be admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed, that it is not to fill vs, if wee did thinke there were no breade nor wine there, which could fill vs? Finally, why take we a little for holines, if we take that which is nothing but all holines it selfe, and of his owne na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, whether we take little or much. You see there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, the Councell ment not to make Christes body a mysticall token of it selfe, which is a monstrous saying, and as monstrous an opinion, but the bread and wine in the sacrament, to be mysticall and diuine tokens of our redemption, wrought in the body and bloudshed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of our sauiour Christ. Wherefore the Apologie without fraude or purpose of deceiuing, hath left out no wordes of the Councell, that make against it, but whatsoeuer it hath omitted, it hath left of that ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage, it might iustly haue taken, if it had through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

For this is the table of Egles, not of Iayes.</q> Iudge now whether Chrysostome meane to tell vs, that the bodye of Christe is vppon the altar, or in heauen. For wee must bee made Egles, not to hoouer vppon the table, but to flie vp into heauen, or rather aboue heauen. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore must wee flie into heauen or aboue heauen? be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause Christ is there. Wherefore must hee that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to this bodie contende vnto the highest place, and to haue nothing to doe with the earth or lower places, if the bodie of Christ lyeth belowe vppon the table? But wee must haue a moste cleare eye of the minde, (sayeth Sander) to see the bodie of Christ vnder the formes of bread and wine, as an Egle flying on high, will fee a fish vnder the water, and catch it, as Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine writeth. But Chrysostome teacheth vs, not to flye vpon high, to looke downe from on high, and see the bodie of Christ vnder the water or clowdes of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidentes, but alwayes to flye vp on high, and to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde the sonne of righteousnesse, which is in heauen, and not belowe on earth; for if the bodie were come downe so lowe as the table, what neede wee flye from it, to beholde it from so great a distance?</p>
                  <p>And whereas hee sayeth, that wee are Iayes, because wee see weakely, and content our selues with a base banket of breade and wine: I woulde hee knewe, wee haue a moste cleare eye of the minde, which through that base banket of breade and wine, can beholde and see the verie bodye and bloud of Christe, sitting aboue all heauens, and flye so high with the winges of faith, that wee not onely see it, but also that wee are thereby fedde and nourished into eternall life.</p>
                  <p>That wee thinke good workes to bring small ayde to life euerlasting, it is, because wee flye like Egles to an higher cause, the onely mercy of GOD in

Iesus Christ, and Papistes bee like Iayes flying belowe, which thinke the vnperfect works of earthly and sinfull men, can helpe to bring them to perfecte happinesse in heauen. But (saith Sander) hee speaketh of the table, whiche standeth in the Church before vs, hee spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth not nowe of heauen, which is aboue the sunne. This saith Sander, without all proofe and against all reason. For Chrysostome saith, it is the table of Egles, therefore it is an higher table then the table in the Church, where vnto we must flie vpwarde alwayes, euen into heauen, where that bodie, which once was deade, is nowe sitting in glorie, yea aboue all visible heauens, and therefore aboue the sunne. So that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> table in Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostome, signifieth metonymically, the spirituall meat and drinke, which the faithfull receiue by faith onelie, whereof the table on earth, with that which is on it, is onely a Sacrament, pledge &amp; assura<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce. But Chrysostome in the same homily saith: <hi>If no man will rashly handle, an other mans garmente, howe dare wee to our greate shame and reproch, receiue this pure and immaculate bodie, which is the Lorde of all, which is partaker of the diuine nature, &amp;c.</hi> Heere (saith Sander) Chrysostome sheweth vs, to receiue the bodie of Christe, from the holy table or Altar, as truely concerning the substance thereof, as wee may truely touch another mans garment. I answere, hee speaketh in this place neither of Altar nor Table, and seeing hee hath before shewed, howe and from whence, Christes bodie is in deede receiued, if afterwarde, he call y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> externall Sacramentes by the names of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which they signifie, and performe to the worthie receiuer.

The plaine meaning of Cyprian is, that the body of Christ, entreth not into the body of man, but into the minde: being no bodily foode, but spirituall foode, as the Apostle calleth it. 1. Cor. 10.

What is meant by not alwayes, and what is alwayes? If thou be a good man, if thou pertaine vnto the body of Christ, which Peter doth signifie, thou hast Christ, both in this prese<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t time, and in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world to come. In this prese<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t world by faith, in this prese<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t world by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> signe of Christ, in this present world by the sacrament of baptisme, in this present world by the meate and drinke of the Altar, Thou hast Christ in this present world, and thou shalt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes haue him. For when thou shalt depart from hence, thou shalt come vnto him, which saide vnto the theefe: This day thou shalt be with me in Paradise. But if thou leadest an euill life, thou seemest to haue Christ in this present world, because thou comest into the Church, sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest thee with the signe of Christ, art baptised with the baptisme of Christ, ioynest they selfe with the members of Christ, commest vnto the Altar of Christ, thou hast Christ in this present worlde, but by euill liuing thou shalt not alwayes haue him. By these wordes it is eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent howe Christ is present in the meate and drinke of the Altar, namely as he is present in Baptisme, which is not corporally but spirituallie. Secondlie, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the vngodly so receiue Christ in the sacraments, that they onely seeme to haue him, when in deede, they haue nothing but the signe of him. Thirdlie, that all the faithfull in Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stines time, receiued as well drinke as meate at the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar. Last of all, while Sander iesteth at the penne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> of the Apologie, hee sheweth him selfe most ridiculous of all. For although Augustine speaketh of the Iewes by Apostrophe, which hee wisheth might be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> conuerted, yet hee speaketh in an homily or Sermon to the faithfull for their instruction, at which neuer a Iewe was present. And where as Sander argueth, that because no infidell was admitted to bee present in time of masse, therefore Augustine might not lawfully talke to a Iewe of the mysticall presence of Christ in the Sacrament: hee sheweth double follye, for why might hee not expounde euen to the Iewes, that which our Sauiour Christe him selfe spake to the vnbeleeuing Iewes of the eating and drinking of his flesh and bloud<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     <pb n="495" facs="tcp:13044:256"/>
and secondly, when hee preached publikely of that my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall presence, or writ of it in bookes which hee set a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broade, to bee redde of all men, howe coulde hee pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibit infidels to heare the one or reade the other? And yet I knowe the ancient Fathers, had such regarde to speak of the mysteries of our religion, before infidels, that they shoulde not take an occasion to scorne them or deride them. Neuerthelesse they were not so daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, as Sander imagineth: Iustinus Martyr in his Apologie to the heathen emperors and Senate of Rome, and in his Dialogue with Tryphon the Iewe, feareth not plainely to expresse what the faith of the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans was concerning these holy mysteries, wherefore Augustine although in these wordes he spake not of the presence of Christ in the Sacrament, yet in other words of the same homilie, as you haue seene, hee speaketh of the presence of Christ, euen in his sacraments.</p>

                  <p>First he affirmeth that Christ may bee receiued three <note place="margin">Fulk.</note> wayes, by faith and spirit onely without the Sacrament, in the Sacrament of the Altar onely without faith and grace, or in both together. Of the laste kind of receiuing, he affirmeth that Christ speaketh toward the later end of the Chap. In the beginning vpon occasion of the miracle of multiplying bread and fishes, he exhorteth the Iewes to worke the meate that perisheth not, which the sonne of man will giue them. This gift (saith hee) is plainelie meant of his last supper, and so saith Theophilact, a late writer. But because they could not come to the working of this gift, without faith vpon him, therefore hee tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth, for a preparation, that he is the breade of life, &amp;c<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> After which preparation made, he returneth (saith he) to expounde his owne gifte, shewing most expressely, that, which he will giue in his last supper. <hi>And the breade which I will giue, is my flesh, for the life of the worlde. But the gift of spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall eating was not to come, when Christ spake vnto his disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
<pb n="497" facs="tcp:13044:257"/>
but Christ saieth, his peculiar gifte was to come.</hi> This onely reason he vseth in this Chapter. Wherein you must note, first that heere of a falsifying minde, hee ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the wordes of Christ otherwise then Saint Iohn did write them. For his wordes are these: <hi>And the breade that I will giue, is my fleshe, which I will giue for the life of the worlde.</hi> In which wordes, the gifte is manifestly referred vnto his passion, and not vnto his supper. Wherefore al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though spirituall eating of his fleshe, was from the beginning of the worlde, yet that singular act, by which the flesh of Christ had vertue to feede vnto eternall life, and was giuen for meate, was not then performed, but was soone after accomplished in his death and passion. For all benefites of Christe, haue like streames flowed alwayes, from the bloud of his crosse, and our redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and reconciliation thereby. If Sander will excuse him selfe of falsifying the scripture, because the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar translation in the later ende of the sentence, leaueth out these words, <hi>which I will giue,</hi> which it is certaine, by the Greeke text of saint Iohn, that our sauiour Christ did speake, hee cannot so escape: for the Latine texte without his preiudicate opinion, brought vnto it, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it want the wordes, yet may well reteine the sense. But Sander wilfully leauing out these wordes, which he knoweth both to haue beene vsed by Christ, and which giue a cleere and cleane contrarie sense, to that whiche hee affirmeth, and that in so weightie a matter, as is the passion of Christe, wittingly incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth the horrible cursse of GOD, pronounced against all them that adde or take any thing from his holie worde.</p>

                     <p>It is prooued by circumstances, and by the conference of holie <note place="margin">Sander.</note> Scriptures, that Christe speaketh in saint Iohn of his laste sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.</p>

neither any one, nor altogether, prooue, that Christ spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth of his supper, otherwise then as it is a seale of the do ctrine which he teacheth in that Chapter.</p>
                  <p>The first circumstance is, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> time, which he supposeth to be Easter tweluemonth, before his supper instituted, to argue, that he speaketh of his supper, is a vaine argument, both because the time is vncertaine, and also because the time of Easter, if it were certaine, hath better relation to his passion, then to his supper.</p>
                  <p>The 2. circumstance is, the myracle made in breade. A ridiculous matter, as though it were not made also in flesh. But in deede the myracle made in meate, gaue oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion to that doctrine vttered in that Chapter, as S. Iohn sheweth. The 3. circumstance, the Propheticall promise, what he would doe the Easter tweluemoneth after. I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere, that promise was fulfilled in his passion.</p>
                  <p>The 4. the conference of thinges done and said about the sea of Tiberias, &amp; at Capernaum, with that was done and said in the last supper. This conference followeth af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward in the 17. conferences. The 5. the present eating of the fathers gift. The 6. the eating of Christes gift to come. To these two circumstances, I answere, that Christ exhorteth the Iewes to the present eating of his flesh, vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on paine of damnation: Except ye eate the flesh, &amp;c. He which eateth my flesh, and drinketh my bloud, hath life euerlasting. Therfore the flesh &amp; bloud of Christ, might be eaten and drunken before his supper. Wherfore none of these circumstances do proue a promise of a sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall eating, which may be without profite, nor an eating of the naturall substance of flesh and bloud of Christ in the sacrament, which at that time was not instituted. But nowe we must come to the conferences. Foure of which conferences, are bread. 2. blessing. 3. thanksgiuing. 4. ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in both. I answere, so there was in all the dinners, and suppers that euer hee did make. Beside that, heere is multiplying, and fish, which is not in the last supper. Therefore a vaine conference. The fift is that as heere, hee beginneth his talke of common breade, and endeth with eating and drinking his fleshe and bloude, so in his
<pb n="499" facs="tcp:13044:258"/>
supper, hee tooke common breade in his handes, and ended his banket in eating and drinking of his body and bloude. But when Sander can make a consequence, of this conference, I will yeelde vnto it, that he speaketh of Sacramentall eating.</p>
                  <p>The 6 and 7. the sonne of man is the giuer, &amp; meate is giuen in both: <hi>ergo</hi> hee speaketh in both of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. I denie the argument, for the meate which the sonne of man giueth, may bee eaten without the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and therefore hee saith, he that nowe eateth my flesh and drinketh my bloud, when as yet that sacrament was not instituted. The 8. conference. Hee saith, the breade which I will giue, is my fleshe, and not the bread which I will take. So in his supper, he tooke one kinde of breade, and gaue another. This is a noble confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, to tel vs what Christ said not. According to which, I might conferre this: He saith, the breade which I will giue, hee saieth not, the drinke which I will giue, is my bloude, therefore in the supper he giueth not his bloude.</p>
                  <p>The 9. conference, the fleshe is giuen in the one, and nothing but the bodie in the other, for the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of common breade was chaunged. This reason in deede is of great weight, if transubstantiation were gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
                  <p>The 10. No common breade is giuen in either of both places, if by common breade he meant prophane breade, and not dedicated to holy vse. I confesse the conference, but seeing by common breade, he meaneth naturall breade, I denie it. For though no naturall or materiall breade was promised to bee giuen in the sixte of Saint Iohn, yet was naturall breade giuen in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament.</p>
                  <p>The 11. The fleshe that dyed for vs, is giuen in both. That is true, but after diuerse manners: in the one it is giuen in a Sacrament, in the other more generally, but in both to bee spiritually receiued, and not car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally. The 12. The gift is eaten in deede in both: I confesse, but spiritually and by faith, yet with this dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, that in the one, it is eaten often without
<pb n="500" facs="tcp:13044:259"/>
the sacrament, the other is a seale or a sacrament of that, which is eaten euen without it.</p>
                  <p>The 13. The bloude of Christ is drunke in both. It is so drunke, as the flesh is eaten. The 14. As in the sixt of Iohn, there is no wine spoken of: so Christ in his supper neither spake of wine, but of drinking, nor gaue any wine at all to bee drunke, because it was by his wordes chaunged into his bloude. I answere, If bread were spoken of, in that which was taken into his hands, wine by Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonymia was spoken of, by taking the cuppe. Secondly, if the fruite of the vine be the matter of wine, wine was spoken of. At Caparnaum, there was no wine spoken of, nor any occupied. Let Sander see howe hee can make the conference with the supper, in which wine was occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied, although he say, it was not drunk, which is a weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie argument, when that which is in question, is brought for the proofe. Last of all, if Christ at his supper, gaue no wine at all to be drunke (as Sander saith) howe agreeth the Popish communion with Christs supper? seeing the Papistes doe giue wine to bee drunke, vnto the laye people.</p>
                  <p>The 15. The twelue Apostles most faithfull, taried with him at Caparnaum, so they alone were admitted in the night of his betraying, to his holy table. In y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full tarying of the twelue Apostles, he forgetteth Iudas, and that the twelue onely were present at the instituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the supper, it is vncertaine. For it is certaine there was more then twelue present at the eating of the Passe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer: and it is prooued before, that Iudas went out before the Sacrament ordeined.</p>
                  <p>The 16. Peter with the twelue protested in both pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, not to forsake Christe. So they did at other times and places, where no mention was of eating Christ. The last, Iudas was reprooued in both places. I answere, Iudas was reprooued in other places, where no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise or mention of the supper is made. Finally I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere, that not any one, nor altogether of these con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences, can make any consequence, to prooue that our Sauiour Christ in that sixt of Iohns Gospel, speaketh of
<pb n="501" facs="tcp:13044:259"/>
the Sacrament, otherwise then as it is a seale, a pledge, an vndoubted token of assurance, of that spirituall eating &amp; drinking of Christs flesh and bloud, which in that Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is commended vnto vs.</p>

                     <p>It is prooued out of the holy Fathers and generall councels, that <note place="margin">Sander.</note> Christ in S. Iohn spake of his last supper.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>I haue shewed euen nowe, in what sort Christ may <note place="margin">Fulk.</note> bee saide to haue spoken of his last supper, in that chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and of that sense and meaning, are the most an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient and sounde fathers, whome Sander citeth to bee vnderstoode. And not one which affirmeth the eating of Christes fleshe and bloude, which there is spoken of, to bee peculiar vnto the supper, and singulerly to bee vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstoode of eating in the sacrament, and not otherwise: which is the onely thing which we denie, and not that the doctrine of that Chapter, doeth not at all pertaine to the supper, but that it is further to bee extended, then to the supper, by which, the carnall manner of ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of Christes flesh, is manifestly ouerthrowne. But let vs briefely, runne ouer his authorities. First Ignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us, Clemens, Alexandrinus, and Origen hee omitteth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they speake nothing almost sounding to his purpose. But Cyprian <hi>in orat, dominica,</hi> seemeth vnto him clearely, to prooue, that it is ment of the supper, because hee writeth, that who so is any long time kept from the sacrament, is in daunger of euerlasting life: alleaging this text of saint Iohn: Except yee eate the fleshe of the sonne of man, &amp;c. For hee shoulde wholie faile of his proofe (saith he) if that place did not prooue the necessitie of communicating sacramentally. I denie the argument: for hee speaketh of them which were cut off from the bodie of Christ by excommunicatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, whose admission vnto the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion, was an assurance of their incorporation againe. This place is answered more at large in my confutation of Heskins lib. 2, cap. 4.
<pb n="502" facs="tcp:13044:260"/>
The second is Athanasius <hi>in syn. nou. test lib.</hi> 4. which saith, Christ reasoneth with the multitude concerning the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries. A sorie argument, as though the spirituall eating of Christs flesh were not a mysterie. It had bene very vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seasonable, to reason with them of that which as yet was not instituted, although as I haue saide, his doctrine may be extended also to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sacrament. The 3. is Hilarie lib. 8. <hi>de Trin.</hi> disputing of the natural veritie of Christ, which is in vs by the sacrament, alleageth these wordes: My flesh is meat in deede. I answere, Hilarie affirmeth that the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall veritie of Christes flesh is in vs, by his incarnation if we be faithfull, which is testified by the mysterie and sacrament of bread and wine.

                        <hi>in Ps. 147.

                     </gap>et expound it of any others argument, as do conformably expound it of the supper of our Lord.</p>
                  <p>To this I reply, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> al or in a maner all do interprete it of our spiritual coniunction, with the body and bloud of Christ, whereof the supper is a Sacrament, and confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.

<pb n="505" facs="tcp:13044:261"/>
haue also expounded them of the supper, whereby their authority is as great, for that which I say, as it is against it. I reply, that none of them expoundeth the wordes of the supper so, as they be singular vnto the supper, and therefore none of them maketh for Sanders purpose; nor expounde them otherwise then I haue shewed in reply to the first answere.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly he answereth, that no one of the fathers is brought forth, who denieth these words in S. Iohn to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perteine to the supper. A lewde answere, for none of vs denieth those wordes to apperteine to the supper, but to be a promise singularly to be referred to the supper. Fourthly, many of the places brought for the contrary opinion, doe manifestly and as it seemeth to Sander, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uincibly prooue the wordes in S.

Heere (saith Sander) he expoundeth not the wordes of bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme, but meaneth according to the custome of the Church, which was to giue the cummunion to infantes, not so much for necessity, as for suerties sake, of which custome we haue mention in Dionysius, Ambrose, and other. The like answer (he saith) may be made to Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centius, Augustinus, and Eusebius Emissenus, which bring these wordes against the Pelagians: Except'ye eat the flesh, &amp;c. to prooue that infantes can not haue life, except they be baptized. To this I reply: it can not be denied, but such an erronious custome co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> word of God, was vsed in those ancient times, to giue the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion to infantes, whereof grew afterward an opinion of necessity, which Pope Innocentius and Augustine, and all the West Church, (as Augustine saith) did hold, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though <note place="margin">Cont. dua<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="506" facs="tcp:13044:262"/>
are literally vnderstoode of the supper, otherwise then as the supper is a Sacrament of that eating and drinking the flesh and bloud of Christ, which Sander confesseth may to be without the Sacrament, euen of such eating of the flesh of Christ, as the fathers were partakers of, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their saluation, before Christ came in the flesh, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of Augustine speaketh most plentisully. In Ioan Tr. 26. and concludeth of this question: <q>
                        <hi>Huius rei Sacramentum, id est vnitatis corporis, &amp;c.</hi> A Sacrament of this thing, that is of the vnitie of the body and bloud of Christ, in some places euery day, in some places by certaine distances of daies, is prepared in the Lords table, and from the Lords table is receiued: of some to life, of some to destruction. But the thing it selfe, whereof it is a Sacrament, is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued of euery man to life, of none to destruction, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer shall be pertaker of it.</q> And because, Sander saith, the maintenance of life dependeth ordinarily vpon the Eucharist alone: The same Augustine saith to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, <q>

I answer, Augustin writeth against the Pelagians, which denied baptisme to be necessary for infantes, as for them that had no originall nor actual sin, laboring to prooue the necessity of baptisme by those wordes of Christ: Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept a man be borne of water, and of the holy Ghost, &amp;c. to bring infantes vnder the compasse of sinne and to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablish their saluation onely by grace, &amp; not by merite of their workes. His cause in deede was good, but his argument was weake, to proue the necessity of baptisme by that texte, euen as to prooue the necessity of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion for infantes by this text, of the 6. of S. Iohn, which is not needful, nor lawful to be giuen vnto them at all. Yet such was his error, that he thought infantes were charged by this text to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municate in paine of da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. That he iudged they ought to be partakers of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> body &amp; bloud of Christ, it is true by y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> text, but that he thought this partaking was by the Sacrament in young children, he was deceiued, yet Sander saith, it was not of necessity, but of surety, whereas Augustines error is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest to vrge it of necessity. <q>

Is there any man that dare say this also, that this sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence pertaineth not vnto young children, and that they may without the participation of this body and bloud haue life in them, because he sayeth not, he that shall not eate, as of baptisme, he that shall not be borne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine?</q> I will make answere to Augustine not in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the Pelagians, but in discouering of his error. Regeneration is vndoubtedly proued necessarie for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, by that place of Iohn 3. as eating and drinking of the body and bloud of Christ in this 6. of Iohn: which is ynough to ouerthrowe the Pelagians, but neither in the one place, nor in the other, the necessitie of the external sacrament is required, but as it may possibly, and ought to be profitably receaued according to the worde of God. Wherefore Augustine in this place ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying the text vnto the sacrament, in arguing from the signe to the thing signified, or contrariwise, must be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstoode according to his deliberate exposition, in Ioh. Tr. 26. or else he should bee founde contrary to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe. And whereas Sander sayeth, This text so appertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to the supper, as it appertaineth not to baptisme, and therefore can not be taken of the spirituall vniting with Christ which is in baptisme: I deny the argument, for although it doth not so properly pertaine to the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of washing, as to the sacrament of feeding and nourishing: yet doeth it also pertaine to baptisme, in as much as by baptisme we are not only washed by Christs bloud from our sinnes, but wholy regenerate, &amp; borne a newe to be the children of God, which wee cannot be, but by participation of flesh &amp; bloud with our brother Iesus Christ, and therefore we are also in baptisme spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually fed with his body and bloud.</p>
                  <p>To that which is brought out of Basil, Ep. 141. That Christ in this text calleth his whole mystical comming, flesh and bloud: Sander answereth, that saying may be verified of the Sacrament of his supper, because he that receiueth worthily, is partaker of all the mysteries of Christ. But that it cannot be singularly applyed to the Sacrament, which is all the question, his owne wordes
<pb n="509" facs="tcp:13044:263"/>
shall declare.  <q>
                        <hi>Edimus enim ipsius carnem, &amp; bibimus ipsius sanguinem per incarnationem participes fientes &amp; sensibitis vitae verbi &amp; sapientiae. Carnem enim &amp; sanguinem totum suum my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterium aduentum nominauit, &amp; doctrinam &amp; actiua &amp; natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rali, ac theologica constantem indicauit per quam nutritur anima, &amp; interim ad veritatis speculationem praeparatur.</hi> For wee eate his flesh and drinke his bloud, being made parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers by his incarnation both of sensible life of the word and of wisedome. For hee named his whole mysticall comming flesh and bloud, &amp; shewed his doctrine, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting of actiue, naturall and theologicall, by which the soule is nourished, and in the meane time prepared vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the beholding of the trueth.</q> Thus by Basils iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, by faith in Christes incarnation and doctrine, wee eate his flesh and bloud, whereof wee are assured by the Sacrament, therefore the text is not a singular promise of Christes naturall flesh, to be after a corporall maner receiued in the Sacrament.</p>

                  </argument>
                  <p>The reasons are for the most parte such, as Papistes <note place="margin">Fulke.</note> haue made, which thinke in their conscience, that this Chapter is not properly to be referred to the Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t: against whome Sander opposeth him selfe, not regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding with what conscience, but with what shewe of wordes, he may maintaine his false position against all men. The argumentes as he numbreth them, are fiue. The first is this: There is no mention of bread and wine in this Chapter: <hi>ergo,</hi> it speaketh not of the supper. This argument Sander denyeth, <hi>because a man may be inuited to a pastie or tarte, although it be not tolde him of what stuffe it shalbe made.</hi> Good stuffe I warrant you. Againe, he saith, the matter of a sacrament, is not more necessarie, then the forme of wordes. But Christ saying to Nicodemus: Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept a man be borne againe of water, &amp;c. although he
<pb n="510" facs="tcp:13044:264"/>
name the matter, sheweth not the wordes that make the Sacrament, yet speaketh he there of baptisme, <hi>ergo</hi> here of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> supper. I denie that he speaketh of baptisme there, otherwise then of the supper here, by comprehending y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> seale of assurance vnder the promise of the thing it selfe. But this argument Sander alloweth wel: Christ speaketh not of bread nor wine, therfore he meaneth not to bind vs to receiue vnder both kindes, but to receiue that thing which is his flesh and bloud vnder what kind soeuer wee receiue it. If this be true, it were well done to take the bread from the people another while, &amp; to serue them of the cup consecrated, for a whole communion. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the synceritie of this Academical disputer, alowing this argument to mainteine horrible sacrilege, as though Christ doth not name drinking, almost as often as ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting: although he name neither bread nor wine. And if his bloud be drinke in deede, then is it not receiued w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the bread, which is not drunke, but eaten.</p>
                  <p>The second argument is, Christ speaketh of eating him by faith &amp; therfore saith: this is the worke of God, that you should beleeue in him, whome he hath sent. He that beleeueth in me, shall not hunger: but there be some of you which beleeue not, so y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the eating is beleeuing, &amp; y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> not eating is, not beleeuing. To this argument grounded vpon the authoritie of Scripture, he hath nothing to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere, but by a lewd distinction of eating of Christ, that is of his grace by faith, &amp; eating Christ, that is his whole flesh, bloud, soule &amp; godhead into our bodies, by colour of these words, <hi>Manducare ex hoc pane, &amp; manducare hunc panem,</hi> which our sauiour Christ manifestly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>foundeth, &amp; vseth for all one. But that you may see his grosse fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly &amp; madnesse, you must remember y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he maketh these words to be the chiefe wordes of promise of his supper; The bread which I wil giue, is my flesh, &amp;c. Now y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whol context is this: I am y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> liuing bread which came downe fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> heauen, if a man eat of this bread, he shall liue for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, &amp; the bread which I wil giue, is my flesh, which I wil giue for the life of the world. Marke now what will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of Sanders distinction. To eat of this bread, is to
<pb n="511" facs="tcp:13044:264"/>
be partaker of grace, by faith, which he confesseth, may be w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out the Sacrament. But that bread wherof he shall eate, is the flesh of Christ, which he will giue for the life of the worlde: therefore, to eate the flesh of Christ, is to receiue Christ by grace, although it be without the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament.</p>
                  <p>The third argument is, Christ was presently y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> breade of life, when he spake to the Iewes, saying I am y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bread of life, and my father giueth you the true bread from heauen, therfore Christ was the bread of life, when hee was first incarnat, for euen then hee came downe from heauen. Therfore his wordes cannot be applyed to his last supper, which was not yet instituted. Sander con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesseth, that Christ was by his godhead and manhod, the bread of life to be eaten of the Iewes, presently by faith, and not corporally. But he saide also: <hi>Worke the meate which the sonne of man will giue you, and the bread which I wil giue, is my flesh:</hi> which gift is fulfilled in his supper. For no reason can be shewed (saith he) why Christ shoulde say, his gift was to come, except it had bene some other gift then to eate him by faith alone, which was law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full at that instant. To this answere of Sander, I replye: first that he groundeth vpon a strange translation of his owne, of working the meate, &amp;c. Secondly, of a pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching together of twoo textes that stande farre a sunder. Thirdly, the worke of meate spoken of in the former text, whereunto they are exhorted, is expounded of faith by Christ himselfe immediately after: This is the worke of God, that you should beleeue in him whom he hath sent. Fourthly, the gift which Christ saith, in the Future tense he would giue, prooueth not that it was yet pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, but promiseth it, to them that will receiue it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently. For if a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> haue a Ring in his hand; he may truly say to them that stande before him: I will giue a Ring to them that shall first come to me. Heere the worde of giuing is in the Future tense, promysing the Ring to him that shall come first for it; yet for all that is the Ring still in his hande.
<pb n="512" facs="tcp:13044:265"/>
Fifthly, this reason I shewe, why Christ saieth, hee will giue his flesh for the life of the worlde, which presently might be eaten, and was eaten, almoste foure thousand yeares before, because his passion, by which it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to the faithfull of all ages, at that time when he spake, was not perfourmed in act, although in effect he was the Lambe slaine from the beginning of the worlde.</p>
                  <p>The fourth argument, which hee consesseth to be of Caietane, is that Christes gifte is not meant of his sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, because it was the gift of himself, to death vpon the crosse, such as shall redeeme the worlde. Which gift was onely perfourmed vpon the crosse, and was partaken al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes of the olde fathers, and may be daily and hourely partaken of vs, which points do not agree with the gift of the holy Eucharist in Christes supper. This argument (saith Sander) is wittily deuised: no doubt, because it was vsed by Caietane a Papist, but yet it is insufficient for many causes.</p>
                  <p>The first cause is, because Christ spake of a meate that he would giue, euen vnto our bodies, and not onely vnto our soules. Howe proueth he, that he spake of such a meate? because he ordeined the miracle of multiply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the fiue loaues to be an introduction vnto this talk, which loaues were eaten corporally, as also that he she<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed himself to be the true bread, that would fulfil and exceede Manna, the figuratiue bread of the Iewes. Two blinde causes, as though he might not take occasion of corporall eating, to speake of spiritual eating, as in the fourth of Iohn, of corporall drinking he taketh occasion to instruct the woman of Samaria, of spiritual drinking, and in the same Chapter, his Apostles of corporall ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, hee teacheth them what spirituall meate was. As for the figure of Manna, of which he speaketh, as of a corporall meate, whereof they that did eate, died: our Sauiour Christ was euen to them that did eate it faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, life euerlasting; &amp; Manna was the flesh of Christ vnto them. But the distinction and contradiction which Christ maketh of Manna and this bread, is that which is
<pb n="513" facs="tcp:13044:265"/>
necessarie to be betweene the bare signe, and the thing signified, from which to reason, as Sander doeth, Manna was eaten corporally and spiritually, therefore the fleshe of Christ is to be eaten corporally and spiritually; is to ioygne together, things that are to be deuided, which is a poore shift of Sophistrie. Beside that, it is a ridiculous argument, to reason of the similitude of those thinges, wherein the auctor sheweth them to be vnlike. For our Sauiour saith, not as your fathers did eate Manna in the wildernes, of which saying, it is much more probable to reason, your fathers did eate Manna corporally, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you shall not eate this breade which I will giue corporally. But he obiecteth that Origen saith: as it is alleaged in the decrees, <hi>De Cons. Dist. 2. C. De hac.</hi> No man eateth properly the flesh of Christe as it was crucified. Therefore Christ speaketh not of his death. Nay rather therefore no man eateth Christe corporally, for hee was crucified corporally. But Sander will haue vs to marke, that Saint Hierom distincteth the flesh of Christ, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he speaketh in Saint Iohn<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>from the respect which the same flesh hath, being crucified. in Ep. ad Eph. Chap. 1.</hi> Saint Ierom saith, the flesh of Christ is two wayes to be considered. that spirituall and diuine fleshe, whereof he speaketh, when he sayth, My flesh is meate in deede, &amp;c. &amp;, except ye eate the flesh of the sonne of man, &amp;c. and that flesh which was crucified. This distinction is of the maner of receiuing the one, which is onely spiritually, and of the maner of handling the other, which was corporally, or it is that distinction which is betweene the effect and the cause. Such difference is by Ierom, betweene Christ crucified, and Christs bodie eaten and drunken, which Sander would haue to be all one in substance and differ onely in eating.</p>
                  <p>The second reason, that Christ speaketh of his supper, as well as of his death, is, that the Greeke text mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth two giftes: The bread that I will giue, is my fleshe, which I wil giue for the life of the world. Here (saith he) is, I wil giue, twise: <hi>ergo</hi> two gifts, and then he defendeth the Greeke text to be true, although the Latine haue, I
<pb n="514" facs="tcp:13044:266"/>
wil giue but once. You see the cunning of the man, that can make them both serue his purpose. But it is Popish Logike, to conclude two giftes of saying twise, I will giue, as in this example: The lande which I will giue you, is the maner of Dale, which I wil giue to you and to your heires. Here is, I will giue twise: therefore two gifts by Master Doctor Sanders Logike. O wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full learning of Popish Doctors!</p>
                  <p>The third reason is, that Christ speaking of the meat, saith, the sonne of man <hi>dabit vobis,</hi> will giue to you, and not only for you. But his death was giuen more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly for vs, then to vs. For it was paied to God for our debtes, but was not properly giuen to vs, for then a sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice should be made of Christ to vs, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly God the father robbed of his glorie. What say you Sander? Can nothing be said properly to be giuen vs, but that which is sacrificed vnto vs? So God loued the world that he gaue his onely begotten sonne, that euery one which beleeueth in him, should not perish, but haue life euerlasting. Iohn. 3. And Esai saith, The sonne is giuen to vs. The spirit of God is giuen to vs, &amp;c. is there no gift but by way of sacrifice? are you not ashamed of such senseles shiftes? Christ in his death was giuen in sacrifice to his father for vs, and his father being reconciled to vs, by that sacrifice, giueth him to vs, and Christ also gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth himselfe for vs, because all the fruite of his death, and sacrifice is referred to our saluation. The fourth reason is, that Christ, naming breade, meate, foode, Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na, &amp;c. promiseth an eatable thing, which is his flesh in a banket, the Iewes vnderstoode his flesh really, not er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring in vnderstanding, but in faith: for Christ co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firmeth their vnderstanding with an oth, sayth: verily, verily, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept ye eat the flesh of the sonne of man, &amp;c. <hi>ergo,</hi> their sense which reterre the gift onely to his death, is not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient, but it must be meant also of the last supper. This argument followeth not: for although the names of bread, food, flesh, &amp;c. proue that Christes flesh is eatable, yet it proueth not, that it is eatable only in the supper. Secondly, that the Iewes erred only in faith, it is false, for
<pb n="515" facs="tcp:13044:266"/>
they erred also in vnderstanding, taking the eating of Christes flesh to be perfourmed carnally, which he ment only spiritually. His oth confirmeth not their vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, but his owne promise of giuing his flesh for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> life of the world, which except they did eat spiritually, they could haue no life in them. But whereas it is obiected, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Christ speaketh of that gift, which was common to the whole world, euen to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Patriarkes &amp; Prophets, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is a spirituall gift, for else Dauid &amp; Abraha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> could not haue partaken it: he answereth, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Christ doth not pro mise any one meat vnto the whole world, but his flesh to be eaten, which is giuen for the whole world. I reply: y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> words are plaine, <hi>the bread which I will giue, is my flesh, which I will giue for the life of the world,</hi> &amp; not only for the Iewes. Neither doth Christ in his supper, giue a far better meat, than he gaue to Moyses &amp; Elias, for he gaue euen to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, his flesh &amp; bloud, to be their spiritual food vnto eternal life: witnesse the Apostle to the 1. Cor. 10. that all our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers did eat &amp; drink the same spiritual meat, that we do, and that their meat &amp; drinke was Christ. Concerning y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> dayly we may eat that bread which Christ promiseth, he answereth, the Sacrament is left to be our daily &amp; super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantial bread, either because we may receiue it daily if we wil, or because it tarieth alwayes with vs by some spirituall effect.</p>
                  <p>To this I answere, that all men cannot receiue it daily, and some men not at all, which yet must haue spirituall foode to feede them vnto euerlasting life: therefore, this breade may be eaten without the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament.</p>
                  <p>The last argument that he woulde seeme to answere, is this: Christ in S. Iohn, speaketh of that eating, which maketh vs tarie in him, &amp; him in vs, therefore not of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramental eating: for Christ tarieth not in all that eate him in the Sacrament. He answereth, the fault is not in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Sacrament, but in them y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> abuse the gift of God to their own hurt. As though our Sauiour Christ did speak only of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> power of his flesh, being eaten, &amp; not of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> effect. The flesh of Christ being eaten, maketh vs one w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> him, &amp; him

Why not baptisme after the same manner? These last wordes declare that Augustine saying that the body and bloud of Christ, may be hurtfull, speaketh of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, and not of the thing or matter of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as in baptisme. As he teacheth in exposition of the doctrine of Christ in Saint Iohn. The Sacrament of this thing, (saith he) is receiued of som to life, of some to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction, but the thing it selfe, or matter of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which is the body and bloud of Christ, is of none receiued to destruction, but of all vnto life, as many as receiue it. By whose whole discourse it is manifest, that Augustine vnderstandeth Christ speaking of spirituall eating, which may be without the Sacrament: and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth a difference betwene y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> meat there spoken of, which presently was offered to be eaten, &amp; the Sacrament ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of which afterward was instituted.

But that the same is to be giuen on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at his last supper, which is the onely matter in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouersie, he is not able to prooue. His first reason is, that because Christ saieth, his flesh is meate in deede, the word <hi>verè</hi> declareth not only a metaphorical worke, by faith, but a true worke of the body and soule, the one in beleeuing, the other in eating. As though Christ is not meat truly, when he is eaten by faith in the soule, or as though a metaphorical meat, can not be called a meate truly or in deede, when Christ speaking metaphorical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, saith he is a true vine. But Tertullian saieth, the flesh feedeth of the body and bloud of Christ, as before wee haue often heard, where he speaketh of externall Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes and outwarde signes, as of baptisme, oynting, imposition of hands, &amp;c. What Theophylact a late wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter saith, we esteem not worth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> weighing.

But his father gaue him to the world, not only in faith and spirite, but in reall and substantiall flesh. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God the sonne by drift of his talke doth signifie, that he will giue in his supper, wherof he speaketh, not in spirite and faith only, but in truth of nature and substance, the selfe same reall and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiall flesh.</hi> O what sporte would such an argumente make among the Sophisters in Cambridge and Oxford: In which be so many tearmes and neuer a meane, so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny false propositions, so many petitions of principles, so much more in the conclusion, then was in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misses, finally so many words, and so litle to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> purpose. But I will make answere briefely and plainly. The e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually of Christ with his father, prooueth in deed that he is able to doe whatsoeuer it pleaseth him, and to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme whatsoeuer he promiseth. But he no where in his Chapter promiseth to giue his reall &amp; substantiall flesh to be eaten bodily: therefore his almighty power proo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth nothing of that purpose. But he promiseth to giue vs the same true flesh, which he receiued of his father to
<pb n="519" facs="tcp:13044:268"/>
be meate tarying vnto eternal life. This promise he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fourmeth daiely vnto the electe, making his bodye and bloud which was crucified and shedde for vs, to be food of euerlasting continuance. Yea (saith Sander) but God gaue him to the world, not only in faith and spirite, but in trueth of nature and substance: therefore Christ will giue vs his reall flesh in substance not in faith and spirite onely. A strange argument, God gaue Christ to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world in the true nature and substance of fleshe, not in spirite and faith only. What mean you by this: God gaue him not in spirite and faith onely? For any thing that I vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstande of your meaning, God gaue him not in faith &amp; spirite at all. For when you speak of Christs incarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and of God sending him in the flesh, what sense is it to say, he sent him in faith or in spirit? But God gaue him naturall flesh, and God gaue him to the world ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifested in the flesh. But howe doth the worlde receiue him being giuen in reall and substantiall flesh? How did all the Patriarkes, Prophetes, and elect before the time of his incarnation receiue him, who being giuen to the world, must needes be giuen to them also? Verily no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise, then in spirite and by faith. Euen so Christ promising to giue his flesh and his bloud to be meate &amp; drinke vnto vs, meaneth not, that it should otherwise be receiued then in spirite and by faith, either in his supper or in baptisme, or without any of the Sacraments. And heerevnto the diuine power of Christ serueth to assure our faith, that he can giue vs his very naturall and diuine flesh, to be receiued spiritually, and faithfully, to feede and nourish vs vnto life euerlasting assuredly.</p>

But Sander sayeth, it is expressely against the worde of God, that by the incarnation of Christ, wee haue not the breade of life giuen vs by any other way then wee had it before. The reason belike is this: That the bread of life is nowe first promised by the gift of Christ, as who came into the worlde to bring vs this euerlasting meate. Marke this Popish diuinitie which restraineth the vertue of Christes incarnation to the instant &amp; time, in which he tooke flesh, and thereby denyeth eternall life to all the Patriarches and Prophets, who by his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son neuer tasted of the bread of life. He talketh much, and to litle or no purpose of the controuersie, that the godhead is life properly, which that it might be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to vs, it assumpted flesh, and this flesh is made meate for vs, but what is the conclusion? It is giuen at Christes supper, vnder the forme of breade, no other meane of giuing will serue. Doeth he not by this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion exclude all them from eternall life, which haue not beene admitted to the Sacrament? and yet like a fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish hypocrite, he cryeth out of our crueltie, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priuing men of the true flesh of Christ, depriue them of the godhead and of eternall life. Whereas he slandereth vs altogether: for we affirme, that euery one of Gods e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect from the beginning of the world, hath beene fedde truely with the verie naturall flesh of Christ, but spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally receiued, and by other meanes then vnder y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> forme of breade in the supper, namely by faith, and in other Sacraments in them that were of discretion, and might come to them, and euen without faith and without Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments (in such of Gods elect, as lacking age were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uented by death, before they could be partakers of sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments) by the onely working of Gods holy spirite, who no lesse worketh in this wonderfull spiritual nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishment, then in any spirituall regeneration.</p>

                     <pb n="521" facs="tcp:13044:269"/>
And therefore Sander reasoneth like a grosse Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher, when he sayth: <hi>that no signe is able to comiey that hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly bread to vs. It is horrible blasphemie to say, that my faith is able to deriue the substance of God, as meate into my soule and bodie, seeing faith is but a creature onely, wherein the fulnesse of Godhead dwelleth not, and therefore is not able to attaine to the vnion of Gods nature, and much lesse able to giue it mee.</hi> And yet for all this that Sander sayeth, the Apostle prayeth that Christ, in whome the fulnesse of the godhead dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth corporally, may dwell in our heartes by faith. In deede, not by the worthinesse of faith, but by the grace of the holy spirite, who giueth strength to the weake e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lements of the worlde, and to our vnperfect faith, to bring to passe wonderfull effects, as we may see in bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme. Wherefore, to reason of the weakenesse of signes, and vnablenesse of faith, seuerally from the spirite of God, is as much, as if you would go about to proue, that because a mans body without his soule can do nothing, therefore, being vnited to his soule, it is not of force to do any thing. To prooue that wee cannot be partakers of the Godhead of Christ without his flesh, he alleageth Cyrillus and Augustine, whose authorities, it is needeles to repeate, seeing wee grant as much as he would haue to be proued by them. But beside them, he citeth Hilarius <q>
                        <hi>
                           <bibl>lib. 8. de Trinit.</bibl> Si verè verbum, &amp;c.</hi> If the worde be truely made flesh, and in our Lordes meate, wee truely receiue the worde made flesh, howe can it bee but hee must be iudged to dwell naturally in vs?</q> Hereof, he gathereth that wee receiue Christ into our bodies after a carnall manner of receiuing, which is farre from Hilaries mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, although he vse the worde naturally, which euen Sander must confesse to be vnproperly vsed, or else hee shall admitte many vnnaturall conclusions. Wherefore by naturally, he meaneth properly, verily, and truely, yet after a diuine and spirituall manner, not after a grosse, naturall, and sensible manner of habitation.</p>
                  <p>Againe, this dwelling of Christ in vs naturally, doeth not prooue, that hee is corporally receiued into our mouthes, and settled in our stomakes. But this is
<pb n="522" facs="tcp:13044:270"/>
sufficient to prooue, that he meaneth Christ to be spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually receiued, in that hee affirmeth, it is not possible but that he must dwell naturally in them that receiue his flesh in the Lordes meate. Sander addeth, worthily: But Hilarie sayeth, truely. Therefore whosoeuer true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly receiueth the flesh of Christ in the meate of our Lord, Christ must needes dwell in him naturally: but Christ dwelleth not at all in the vngodly, therefore the vngod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly receiue not his fleshe in the Lordes meate, as the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistes say, in whome also hee shoulde dwell naturally, if hee were receiued truly, or as they say, corporally.</p>

God by Moyses (sayeth Sander) is sayde to haue giuen in time past, he hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen them breade from heauen to eate. But Christ sayeth, Moyses gaue you not breade from heauen, but my Father giueth you the true bread from heauen: Euen he which gaue them Manna for a Sacrament of the true breade, euen he gaue then, giueth nowe, and shall giue for euer the true breade from heauen, which is the fleshe of our Sauiour Christe incarnate, crucified, reuiued, and ascended into heauen for our saluation.

And therefore it is out of measure absurd, that Sander would proue his figuratiue forme by Irenaeus, which saieth, <hi>that the Eucharistie consisteth of two things, of one earthly, which is the forme of bread and wine, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther heauenly &amp;c:</hi> Irenaeus saith, not y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the formes of bread and wine are the earthly part of the Sacrament, but bread and wine in deede, for those externall formes or acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, bee not any earthly thing, which is a substantiall matter. Irenaeus saieth, of the bread and wine, our bodies are increased and nourished: so can they not be of San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders Accidents lib. 5. But hee will shewe the absurdities that rise of the Sacramentaries opinion. If Christes gift (saieth he) consisted of the substance of breade sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in qualitie, and made a signe of his body (as the sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaries teach) it shoulde neither bee the true bread, which his father gaue him, nor better then Manna, &amp;c: But where doe the Sacramentaries teach, that Christes gifte spoken of in this Chapter is the substance of bread sanctified in qualitie &amp;c. Wee teach that Christs gifte is his owne naturall bodie and bloude giuen in his passion to all the faithfull of the worlde, to bee the foode of eternall life, as for the substance of bread giuen in his last supper, wee teach that it is a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and seale of this gift.

In deede the Apostle meaneth, that the same things which were but rudely shadowed, as it wer with a cole, to the fathers in the Law, are in a liuely image de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed, and set forth vnto vs in the Gospel. For the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel hath not those good thinges which are to come, but possesseth them by faith. Therefore how foolish is that conclusion of Sander, vppon this text? Christ gaue vs his real flesh vnder the forme of breade, or else he gaue not the thing it selfe: and if hee gaue it without figure, out state were not an image of the things themselues. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the Apostle speaketh not of these things which are gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, but of the clearenes of the doctrine, of those things which are promised: and therefore he calleth them good things to come, and Christ an high Priest of good things to come. As madde, yea and more frantike is that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion, that Christ cannot be a mediator betweene the two Testaments, except he gaue his flesh vnder the forme and figure of breade. By which drunken conclusion, it should follow, that Christs mediation depended vpon the institution of the Sacrament, which the Apostle in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse words doth affirme to haue bene made complet in his death, which was effectuall vnto all ages alike. Heb. 9. Also that Christ in Baptisme, hath not shewed himselfe to be a mediator greater then Moses, because he hath not therein giuen vs his naturall flesh, which is in heauen: And last of all, that Christ is not a mediator vnto the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
<pb n="525" facs="tcp:13044:271"/>
that liued before the institution of his supper, but onely to them that are partakers of his flesh in the sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. Againe, as vntrue it is, that because Christ came to fulfill the Law, therfore it was necessarie, that he should giue his flesh vnder a figure: which flesh was not giuen to them that liued vnder the Lawe: as though there were one meane of saluation for them, and another for vs.</p>
                  <p>The scripture doth often distinguish the Law, and the Gospel, shewing what is peculiar to either of them, but it neuer affirmeth, that the persons liuing in the time of the strength of Moses Lawe, were saued otherwise then by the Gospel, that is by remission of sinnes, through faith in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mercie of God reconciled to vs by Iesus Christ. Therefore it is more then blockish, to wrest the distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Testame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, to make a difference of the salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the persons. Seing the new Testament was not first ordeined (as Sander seemeth to say) when Christ did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute his supper, which hee called the new Testament, but euen from the beginning of the world, but yet to take effect, vertue and strength, by the death of Christ, of which Testament, the supper is a sacrament, bearing the name of the thing whereof it is a Sacrament, as well when it is called the newe Testament, as when it is called the bodie and bloude of Christ. And therefore the example of the precept, of not killing, expounded by Christ to extend to anger, proueth not any newe trueth to be added by the Gospel, but the ancient right mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement, deliuered from the glosse of the Pharisees, which expounded the precept, onely of murthering with the hand. For who will say that such anger as Christ forbiddeth, was lawfull before the time he made that exposition; or that to commit adulterie in heart, by lusting after a woman, was not sinne, before Christ did so interpret that commaundement. If it were sinne, then it was a breach of the Law: if it were a breach of the Lawe, it was of the Lawe that was giuen: therefore the Lawe was alwayes spirituall, and had that true mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and was so taken of all good men, before Christ re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooued the corruption of the Pharisaical glosses. That
<pb n="526" facs="tcp:13044:272"/>
all legall instruction, and propheticall figures, are trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred into the sacraments of Christ, as Leo saith, we agre. We denie not, that which Dionyse saieth, although wee may not acknowledge him to haue beene S. Pauls schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler: that our holy gouernement partaketh of heauen, spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall contemplation, and of the Lawe sensible signes. Neither of both these autorities proue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> matter in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion. As for the distinction of gifts, whervnto Sand. tum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth againe, in the end of this chapter, we make not voyd by our figuratiue doctrine. But such distinction as was in deede, betweene that which Moses gaue, and God gaue, we vpholde by our figuratiue doctrine, which sheweth y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> right difference betweene the auctor and y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> minister, the signe &amp; the thing signified. But y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> distinction betwene y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> gift which y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Father gaue alwayes, and y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which the sonne promiseth to giue to be diuerse, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Sander ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> proue, we may be brought to acknowledge it: In the meane time, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> promise of continuance of that gift, in the Future temps, which Christ hath alwayes giuen, is a slender argument to proue the distinction of gifts imagined by Sander.</p>
                  <p>Finally in substance of the foode of eternal life, as we differ not in the life eternall it selfe, we are not preferred before y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> lewes.

baptisme also, and without any sacrament. But that it must stand for a trueth vniuersally receiued, that Christ saying, The breade which I will giue is my flesh, meant y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bread which I wil giue you at my last supper, that I say I denie. What Sander vaunteth he hath proued thereof, in the 5. and 6. chapters of this booke, let it bee examined with mine answere. But admit he had spoken principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of his supper, yet doeth it not followe, which Sander doth inferre, that he promised to giue his flesh to Iudas because he was one of the twelue which taryed with him at Capernaum, for his promise in offer, was as large to all that departed, and to the world, for the life whereof he promised to giue his flesh, therefore it cannot be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded that it was not onely a spirituall gift that was promised but an externall gift deliuered by hand, which Iudas might receiue. For Christ promiseth such a gift, as if it be receiued, worketh eternall life in the receiuers.</p>
                  <p>Finally, it cannot be prooued, that Iudas was prse<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t at the supper, who departed about his treason, before the insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of the sacrament, as appeareth by saint Iohn im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly after the soppe receiued, wherevnto some of the ancient writers also do consent.

For God gaue his sonne for the worlde, and Christ gaue himselfe for vs, yet but one gift. The difference of time, I haue often answered. As for the obiection, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he faineth the Sacramentaries must say, that that flesh heere sta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth for the signe or figure of his flesh, is of his owne making, for as I said before, we vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand the flesh of Christ giuen for the life of the world, his naturall body, crucified for vs, and not the sacrament of his body giuen in his last supper.</p>

God gaue by Moses, <note place="margin">Fulke.</note> naked figures, as Manna: God giueth presently, the flesh of Christ to our eyes and heartes: and Christ will giue hereafter the same flesh, vnder the forme of breade. Of these giftes he maketh three diuerse workes: the first by teeth and belly, the seconde by faith and spirite, and the thirde by both. The gift of Christ differing from Manna, is expressed in the Chapter. But any difference of the gift of the father, and of the sonne, there is not expressed, nor to be gathered by any note of distinction or dissentanie argument. Yet Sander hath founde out a great number of differences, to prooue that although the Father and the Sonne giue one thing, that is the flesh of Christ, yet not one way to be receiued, the Father giueth it to bee receiued by faith onely, the Sonne to be receiued cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porally.</p>
                  <p>The first difference is, of the time, The Father doeth giue in the Present tense, the Sonne will giue in the Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture tense. This I haue often answered to be no differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>te, for Christ saith in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> prese<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t temps, except ye do eat y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> flesh: &amp;c. <hi>ergo</hi> he did presently giue it. Againe, he that doth eat often, is ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> times repeted, in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> present time, and my flesh is meate in deede: all which prooue that Christs gift, was present when he spake to be receiued, therefore it diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth not from the Fathers gift, and way of receiuing the same.</p>
                  <p>The second difference: the Father giueth Christ in the forme of man, by the manner of the Fathers gift, the faithfull may see y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> sonne of Man, vpon whom they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue: as it is saide, This is the will of my Father which sent me, that euery one who seeth the Sonne, and belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth in him, may haue euerlasting life. And againe: yee haue seene me, and haue not beleeued. Of the Sonnes gift it is not saide, that his flesh shalbe seene, but rather insinuated, that it shalbe vnder the couering of another kinde of foode. I answere, that Christ in neither of both these sayings, speaketh of the corporall sight of his body.

The difference of a true Vine, and a Vine truelie, is sufficiently di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scussed in the later ende of the fourth booke answered by master Nowel. Sander cannot or will not consider y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> difference of the opposition betweene truely and falsely, and truely and properly.</p>
                  <p>The fourth difference: The Iewes and disciples, went not away from Christe, for any thing, that was spoken about the Fathers gifte, thinking that a gifte of eating by faith, might stande with the custome of Gods people, but in the Sonnes gift, they sawe more apparant absurdity, not lacking vnderstanding, but faith, and therefore departed.

                  <p>The 5. difference, <hi>The gift of the father is called by such names only, as belong to the perso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Christ, or to his diuine nature to say, the bread of life, the liuely bread, the true bread (for God onely is absolutelie the true bread of life) or by the Pronoune I: The gift of Christ is called also by the names of his humane nature, to wit, the flesh and bloud of the sonne of men.</hi> If this differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce proue any thing, it prooueth not the diuerse wayes of giuing the same thing, but that the same thing is not giuen by the Father and the Sonne: Where as Sander saide before, that the Father giueth Christ in humane nature, to the worlde. If the humane nature of Christ bee giuen of the father, the names thereof may well agree to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers gift.</p>
                  <p>The 6 difference, <hi>That Christ endeth his talke of eche gif<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

But Manna was more perfectly fulfilled in outward doings by the sonnes gift.</hi> This is an agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment rather then a difference, except in the last illation, which is a meere begging of the matter in question. But there is a great difference, in that it is said of the one, If any man eate, <hi>ex hoc pane</hi> of this breade; in the other, he that eateth <hi>hunc panem</hi> this breade: and heere is made a great difference, betweene eating of Christ, and ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Christ himselfe: the one is onely by faith, the other in the Sacrament of the Altar, the one is to bee parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker of the vertue and grace of Christ, the other to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the substance of Christ. &amp;c. But our sauiour Christ in S. Iohn confoundeth this difference, vsing the Accusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue case and the Ablatiue: with the preposition, for all one. I am the liuing bread, which came downe from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, if any man shall eate of this bread, he shall liue for
<pb n="531" facs="tcp:13044:274"/>
euer: Here is the Ablatiue with a preposition, but what is this bread, of which he that eateth shal, liue? he answereth: The bread which I wil giue, is my flesh, whereof he saith afterward, Except ye eate the flesh of the sonne of man, &amp;c: where he vseth the Accusatiue: by which it is plaine, that with Christ, to eat this breade, &amp; to eat of this bread, is all one. Saint Paul also ouerthroweth this difference, shewing that the Israelites did drink of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> spiritual Rock, which was Christ, vnworthily, where as none can receiue the effect of Christes death vnworthily. So he saith wee are al partakers of one bread. But Sand, not satisfied, as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth if this be y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> end of our long disputatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Christ came into the world to giue a lesse token, then God had giuen before, vnder Moses &amp;c? as though Christ came into the world for no end but to giue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sacrament. As for so many differences as he dreameth of his fathers gift, and his, we finde not any one, but that they may all agree in one gift, which was not his supper, but himselfe to death, for the life of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world, wherof euery one of his elect is made partaker, as of spiritual foode, by faith &amp; his holy spirit.</p>
                  <p>But this difference is learned, saith he, out of Chryso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome, vpon Iohn. Ho. 45. &amp;c. where he noteth first the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersitie of persons, saying: <hi>Se, non patrem,</hi> that he, not his father <hi>dare</hi> to giue (saith Sander) but he falsifieth Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostome, which saith <hi>dedisse,</hi> to haue giuen, which proueth that it is not giuen onely in the Sacrament, which then was not instituted. 2 That hee saith, Hom. 44. that Christ speaketh first of his diuinitie, and about the ende, of his bodie, prooueth not that he speaketh onely of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: For Hom. 45. he saith plainely, as Sander confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bread signifieth either the doctrine of Christ, and saluation, and faith in him, or else his body. Wherin hee dissenteth altogether from Sanders interpretation, who will not haue the bodie of Christ promised before flesh be named.</p>
                  <p>But Chrysostome saith vpon these wordes: my flesh is meat in deed: &amp;c. that he so saide, to the end they should not thinke him to speake in parables; but by fleshe, to meane the signe of flesh, or by eating, to meane be lee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
<pb n="532" facs="tcp:13044:275"/>
is to speake in parables. I answere, that wee say nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of both: but that Christ is verily eaten by faith, and by the spirite of God: yet Sander omitteth the other cause which Chrysostome rendreth of his so saying: <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>Finally that which is noted out of Hom. 83. in Matth. that Christ is ioyned vnto vs, not by faith and loue one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but in verie deede: Wee confesse, but so is hee ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to infants that neuer receiued the supper, and so was hee ioyned to all the faithfull before his incarnation, in as much as they all were members of his bodie. And so confesseth Chrysostome, in Ioan. Homil. 46. that Abraham by eating and drinking the flesh and bloud of Christ, shall bee partaker of the resurrection, and therefore Christ saide, He that eateth my flesh, and drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth my bloud, hath life eternall and I will raise him vp in the last day. The testimonies of Theophilact, and Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thynius which are but late writers in comparison, I will not stande vpon.</p>

For spiritual food, which is nothing else but y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> body &amp; bloud of Christ, is as necessarie for al ages, as for perfect age. But that the flesh of Christ is as necessarie in the supper
<pb n="533" facs="tcp:13044:275"/>
to feede vs, as water in Baptisme to wash vs, it is a froward and foolish compariso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: for water washeth not our soules, nor regenerateth vs, but the holy ghost, whereof water is a signe: so the flesh of Christ is as necessarie in the supper to feede vs, as the holy ghost, to wash vs and regenerate vs, which seeing it doth without transubstantiation of the water into the spirite, likewise doth the flesh and bloud of Christ nourish vs, without transubstantiation of the outward signes into them. The right Analogie is betweene water, and breade, and wine, and betweene the spirite of God, and the flesh and bloud of Christ, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene outward water &amp; spirituall flesh of Christ, which is as preposterous a comparison, is if you would compare the holy ghost in baptisme, with the breade and wine in the sacrament. But of the error of Cyprian, Innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius, and Augustine, he will prooue, the necessitie of the presence of Christs flesh in the supper, because they gaue the communion to infantes, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> coulde not receiue it with faith &amp; vnderstanding: therfore they thought y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> very bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy &amp; blod of Christ to be really co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tained in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t.

Therfore that they ministred the communio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to infants, it shewed their error proceeding of ignorance, as all error doth: but it sheweth not, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they thought y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> one sacrament to be other wise then the other, a seale or assurance of iustification, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out any dreame of transubstantiatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.

And which of the Lutherans I pray you, denyed, that it appertaineth to the last supper, although they deny y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it is singularly spoken of the last supper?

Augustine meaneth by a figuratiue speach, which is al one as if he would teach vs to go to supper, as it is in the Greeke prouerbe. First a siguratiue speach must not denie any word in the speach, to be vsed vnproperly, but is measured by faith and good manners. Whereas Augustine telleth vs, that if in any sentence of the scripture, the words sound against faith, &amp; good manners, the words must not be taken in their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per sense, but they are a figure, and signifie some other thing, then the words in their proper taking do sound, as
<pb n="535" facs="tcp:13044:276"/>
diuerse examples which he bringeth in the same place, beside his plaine wordes, do declare. This saying hee affirmeth to be a figuratiue speache, Thou shalt heape burning coales on his head, which he doeth thus inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prete: <q>

And it is a foolish cauil of Sander, to say that charitie is not broken, when we eate Christ whole vnder the forme of breade, without hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of him, &amp;c. For Augustine counteth it <hi>slagitium,</hi> an heynous offence, to eate the fleshe of man in proper sense of eating, that is corporally: Yea, faith Sander, to eate it in peeces, as it is solde in tho shambles. As though to eate an whole man after that maner, were not more monstrous, then to eate a piece of him. But San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to shewe his synceritie, rehearseth a large place out of Augustine in Psal. 98. which, howe cunningly he can wrest for his purpose you shall see. <q>
                        <hi>Durum illis visum est &amp;c.</hi> It seemed an hard thing to the Iewes: except a man eate my flesh, he shall not haue life euerlasting. They tooke it foolishly, they thought of it carnally, and sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed that our Lord minded to cutte of certeine small peeces of his body, and to giue them. This is an hard talk, say they. They were harde, &amp; not the talke. For if they were not hard but gentle, they would say to them selues: He speaketh not this thing rashly, but because ther lieth priuie som sacrament being gentle &amp; not hard they wold tati w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> him, &amp; shal learn of him y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thing which
<pb n="536" facs="tcp:13044:277"/>
after their departure, those learned who taried. For when the twelue had taried with him (the other beeing departed) they (as who were sory for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> others departing) warned Christ that they were offended with his word, &amp; so were departed. But Christ instructed them and saied: it is the spirite that quickneth, the flesh profiteth not, the wordes which I haue spoken to you, are spirite and life. Vnderstand y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which I haue spoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>spiritually. Ye shal not eate this body which you see, wee shall not drinke that bloud which they shall shedde, who will crucifie me: I haue commended to you a certeine Sacrament, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing spiritually vnderstoode, shall make you liue. And although that Sacrament must needes be visiblye cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated, yet it must be inuisibly vnderstanded.</q> Three thinges Sander noteth out of this sayinge: First against the Lutherans, that Augustine vnderstandeth the precept of eating Christes flesh of the Sacrament. I answere, that Augustine in other places, and namely in his purposed commentary of that place, vnderstandeth it not to be singularly spoken of the eating in the Sacrament, but otherwise also: which is all that wee affirme and denie of referring this place to the Sacrament. Secondly he no teth against the Zwinglians, that the figuratiue speach which Augustine saieth to be in these wordes, is to be meant of the manner of eating, in the natural vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

I answere the naturall vnderstanding of carnall men is by eating to receiue in at the mouth that which is eaten &amp;c. wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Augustine denieth that also. Thirdly he noteth that he calleth it Sacrament which in his booke <hi>de doct. Christ,</hi> he called a figure, taking the name of a figure for a holy signe of an higher trueth. This is a grosle and shameles collection, for he calleth the wordes of Christ a figure, and a figuratiue and vnproper speache, which must not be taken according to the sound of the words: <q>

By which words you see that a figuratiue spech is an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper speach. But how can this snake slide away from those wordes of Augustine? You shall not eate that body which you see, nor drinke that bloud which they shall shedde, I commend vnto you a Sacrament. Therefore y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Sacrament is not his body which then was seen, nor his bloud which afterward was shedde. But Sander gliding ouer these wordes, as though he sawe them not, presu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming vpon the credulity of Papistes, which must beleue that they make nothing against the carnall manner of presence, if he say so: he passeth to another saying of Augustine in Ioan. Tr. 26. &amp;. 27. to proue that the error of the lewes was not concerning the substance of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> flesh that must be eaten really, but concerning y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> manner of eating of it. Because Augustine saith <hi>carnem intellexerune quomodo, &amp;c.</hi> They vnderstoode flesh, so as it is torne in a carcase, or sold in the shambles, and not as it is quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> spirite of God. I answer, this was one of their errors, but not all. For Augustine in Ps. 98. bringeth in Christ, denying them his naturall body and bloud: <hi>ergo</hi> they erred in the substance as well as in the manner: &amp; in Ioan Tr. 24. he saith: <q>
                        <hi>Illi putabant eum erogaturum corpus suum, ille aut em dixit se ascensurum in coelum vtique integrum. Cùm videritis fiüum hominis ascendentem vbi erat prius, certè vel tunc videbitis, quia non eo modo quo putatis, errogas corpus suum, vel tunc intelligetis quia gratia eius non consumitur mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibus.</hi> They thought, that he would giue out his body, but he said, that be would ascende into heauen whole. When you shal see y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sonne of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ascending wher he was before, certeinly euen then at lest you shall see, that he giueth not out his body after that manner you thinke, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen then at lest you shall vnderstand, that his grace is not consumed with bitinges.</q> In these wordes, the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his ascension, taketh away all corporal presence as wel of Christ whole, as broken in peeces, secondly the exposition of his grace not consumed w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> byting, sheweth after what manner he vnderstandeth his body to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, namely by spirituall grace, not by corporall sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance. Therefore all Sanders iangling of signes and
<pb n="538" facs="tcp:13044:278"/>
figures, is to no purpose. For when he hath prated what he can, a signe shall neuer be the thing which it signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth; nor a figure the same thing that it figureth, except opposites may agree to one thing at one time, and in one respect.</p>
                  <p>For to vse his owne foolish example, a loafe of bread, which a baker setteth out, to signifie that bread is there to bee folde, although it be of that kinde of breade, which it signifieth to be in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> house in greater quantity, yet it is not that same bread, wherof it is the signe. No more is the Sacrament, that same thing, whereof it is a signe, and yet an assured testimonie that the thing signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied is giuen to our soules and faith, as certeinely as the signe to our bodies. But because Augustine saith, except ye eate my flesh, are wordes figuratiue. Sander will rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son thus: as cunningly I warrant you, as any collier in Cambridge or Oxford. <hi>The eating of Christs flesh and drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of his bloud, being reall deades which must be performed in Christes supper, and yet being called for good respect figurat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine saith the words are figuratiue, &amp; not the deeds of eating &amp; drinking, which are signified by the words, Except ye eate, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>The wordes I saye, of eating and drinking of the flesh and bloud of Christ, are figuratiue, betokening another thing then they sound in common and proper

vnderstanding; and what they signifie, he sheweth, the communication with the passion of Christ, and profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table remembrance of his death, which as they are represented in the supper, so may we eate and drinke his flesh and bloud without the Sacrament, by faith and working of Gods spirite. <hi>But</hi> (saith Sander) <hi>if the eating of Christes flesh be not the figure, the wordes Except ye eate my flesh, be not figuratiue.</hi> Se you not howe this fonde Sophister, confoundeth the distinction which he him selfe before had made of figuratiue speeches and figures of thinges themselues? betweene rhetoricall figures and sacramentall figures. I say the spirituall eating which is the communication, with his passion, &amp;c. is not a figure, but that which is vnderstoode by those figuratiue wordes, except ye eate the flesh, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>And although there may be a reall eating to warne vs of spirituall eating; yet that spirituall eating which Saint Augustine calleth communicating with the passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Christ, &amp;c. may be without the Sacrament, and so is Augustine discharged of Sanders Sophistry.</p>
                  <p>But now he will discouer the errors of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaries in expounding these wordes: the first is, that they make the wordes of Christ to be figuratiue onely passiuely, whereas they are also figuratiue actiuely. But how I pray you are the wordes figuratiue ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuely? He answereth, the actuall eating of Christes flesh, is not onely said to be figured, but also is taught to be a figure it selfe, of another spirituall eating.</p>
                  <p>If Sander were as ignorant, as his argumentes are absurd, he were the most notable Asse, that euer wrote in diuinity, but I impute it not to ignorance, but to malicious deceitfullnes, that he confoundeth wordes and deedes, and reasoneth thus: the wordes be figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratiue actiuely, because the deede is figuratiue actiuely, which is such a monster, as Sophistry neuer bredde a greater. And what proofe haue you of this actuall ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of Christes flesh, to be a figure actiuely of spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall eating?

The first, that the Iewes asked howe he would giue his flesh to be eaten. The second, that Christ saith, the eating of his flesh was necessarie and profitable, both for bodie and soule. The thirde, that Christ confirmeth these his sayings with this reason. For my flesh is meate in deede, and my bloud is drinke in deede: that is, it hath truely and in deed, those properties, that any man would wish for in true meate. <hi>But the properties of true meate are, to be receiued into the bodie, and to be a medicine against death.</hi> If none be true meate, but that which is receiued into
<pb n="542" facs="tcp:13044:280"/>
the body, then that which Sander so often calleth the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers gift, the bread of life, which came downe from heauen is not true meate, for that he hath often saide, may be receiued by saith and spirit not entring into the body, yet thereof saith Christ, that he is the true bread. But Chrysostome vpon these words, My flesh is meat in deede, &amp;c. saith <hi>that it meaneth that flesh to be the true meat, which saueth the soule, or else he speaketh it to confirme them in the former words, that they should not thinke him to haue spoken in parables darkely, but that they shoulde knowe it to bee by all meanes necessarie, to eate his body, in Ioan. Hom. 46.</hi> He that granteth both these senses (saith Sander) must needes grant that the true eating of the flesh, standeth not for eating truely the signe of the fleshe, because hee spake not obscurely in parables. Verily he were worthy to weare a cockescombe, that would say true eating of the flesh, standeth for eating truely the signe of the fleshe. Against whome then doeth Sander fight, but against an idoll of his owne braine? but it is an obscure saying to put eating for beleeuing. I answere, Chrysostome spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth of the meate, and not of the manner of eating: for if there be no obscuritie in the manner of eating, let Sander speake of his small conscience, when he saith the manner of eating to be vnder another kind, then it selfe is, which is most obscure and imperceptible. But if his flesh be called meate, because it must bee eaten bodily, wherefore then is his bloud called drinke in deed, which Sander holdeth not to be necessarie to be dronke bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly? For if his bloud in that sense be drinke in deede, it must be drunke in deede, and not eaten with the bodie. But Augustine, <hi>lib. 13. De ciuitate Dei. Cap</hi>

That other trees of Paradise were a nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; the tree of life, a Sacrament: So that the tree of life should be taken to be after such a sort, in the bodily Paradise, as the wisedome of God is in the spirituall intelligible Paradise. Of which wisedome it is written, It is the tree of life, to all that embraece it.</hi> What can Sander make of this saying? As corporall tasting in the tree of life, was necessarie for the spirituall effect of incorruption, so Christes flesh
<pb n="543" facs="tcp:13044:280"/>
must be corporally tasted that it maie be meate indeede. I denie the comparison, which shoulde be made of the tree with bread, and of life with Christe, and not of woode with the flesh of Christ. And it is certaine, that Augustine not only compareth the sacrament with the sacrament, but also calling Christ, the spirituall part of the sacrament, the wisedome of God, which is a tree of life to all that embrace him, signifieth that Christ is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise receiued, then with the mouth: for embracing is more aptly said to be with the armes of faith, then with the lippes of the body, who can not touch the wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God. But Sander once againe to make his mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter good, repeateth his ranke and rotten distinction of two giftes, two giuers, two manners of eating, true meate, and meate truely: affirming meate truely to bee because it is receiued in at the mouth, and goeth into the bodie, after such sort, as other meates doe, although it nourish spiritually. Where there is no effect of that he calleth meate truely, but it is by plaine wordes of the Chapter, ascribed to that which is called true meat, which he consesseth may be receiued onely spiritually: euen the vertue of raising vp our bodies: for which cause hee woulde make the bodily eating to be neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarie. He that beleeueth in mee, hath life eternall, and I will raise him vp againe in the last day.</p>
                  <p>Afterwarde, he citeth Hilarie: who presseth the word <hi>verè</hi> against the Arrians. But yet Sander translateth him falsely. For to make it seeme, that Hilarie spake of such bodily eating as hee doeth, he turneth these words, <hi>Haec accepta atque hausta efficiunt:</hi> these thinges taken and swallowed: whereas he should say, these things, that is the flesh and bloud of Christ, being taken and drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, do cause this, that both Christ is in vs, and wee in him, which must needes be taken for eating and drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king spiritually: For eating &amp; drinking his flesh corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, Sander confesseth to haue no such effect. Howe Christ tarieth in vs naturally, and how we truely vnder a mysterie take the flesh of his bodie, I haue spoken be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and these places of Hilarie are discussed more at large in mine aunswere to Heskins, lib. 2.

beleue without al controuersie, that from the beginning of the world, to the end, none can be ioyned to Christ otherwise then by eating his flesh &amp; drinking his bloud: but whether Christes flesh can be eaten and drunken without eating bodily the Sacrament, that is the questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And therfore Sander maketh a large &amp; needlesse dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, in this Chapter, to shew how Christ liueth for his father and how we must liue for him, that is by partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation of his flesh and bloud, which is that naturall par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipation, whereof Hilary speaketh against the Arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, which saied, we are ioyned to him onely in vnity of will, which is not so: for he by his incarnation, is natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally ioyned to vs, and we by participation of his flesh are naturally ioyned to him, so that wee are flesh of his flesh, and bone of his bone, of which coniunction the Sacrament is an heauenly pledge and assurance.

Yes, we eat the flesh of Christ both in the Sacrament and without it, with our soules which is of force to giue life both to bodies and soules. <hi>Fourthly they are against the foode of our bodies, which is the flesh of Christ.</hi> No forsooth, wee acknowledge that flesh of Christ to be foode to feede the whole man, body and soule vnto eternall life, but yet so to feede the body as it is not receiued corporally, nor feedeth corporally, but after a spirituall and diuine manner. And heere he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth

the Zwinglians to affirme, that the sanctified bread in the supper, is the foode of our bodies, vnto eternall life, as water in baptisme is the instrument and meane as wel to bodies &amp; soules of euerlasting life. Which is vtterly false, for they affirme, neither y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bread to be food, nor the water to be regeneration otherwise, then as ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly signes, seales, pledges, assurances of spirituall feeding and regeneration. But Sander by scripture, will destroy this comparison, affirming that God in deede may vse what meanes he will, to saue vs, but by his word, he hath testified his wil, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> baptisme hath his promise of saluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> annexed to it, but no promise is made to material bread and wine, nor to him that eateth and drinketh them. I answere, neither is any promise made to the water in baptisme, but to him that receiueth it worthily, and to him that eateth and drinketh materiall bread and wine in the Sacrament, the like promise is made of remission of sinnes and of eternall life: not in respect of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bread &amp; wine, but in respect of him that feedeth our faith by that Sacrament, and by faith and working of his holye spirite feedeth vs with his flesh and bloud, euen when that Sacrament is not receiued. But Cyril saith in Ioan, lib. 10, Cap. 13. <hi>Non poterat, &amp;c. This corruptible nature of the body could not otherwise be brought to incorruption and life, vnlesse the body of the naturall life, were ioyned vnto it.</hi> This is true: but the manner of the coniunction is all the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter we stand vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which we affirme must be such, as may ioyne euery body of Gods elect that hath bene &amp; shall be, to the body of the naturall life, which cannot be the Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tal coniunctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or corporal receiuing of Christs naturall body into our bodies, which was denied to al y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fathers before Christes incarnation.

As for the conuersion of bread and wine into his body and bloud, his presence at the table and in their mouthes, and in heauen, &amp;c. shew not a spirituall manner of giuing his body, but a monstrous alteration of bodily thinges, which are affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to be so really and corporally, and yet contrary to the nature of all thinges and bodies spoken of.

                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders reason, which will prooue these wordes to be most proper, &amp; least figuratiue, because they partake most of the godhead, in which there is no change, wheras figures or tropes come of the Greeke worde, which signifieth changing. Notwithstanding this great clerk, oftentimes before hath taught vs, that whatsoeuer is spoken of bread and meat, and eating in Iohn 6. Chapter, vntill he come to this saying: (And the bread which I wil giue is my flesh) doth pertaine to the godhead of Christ, and the participation therof by faith: in which wordes he cannot denie, but bread, meat, eate, hunger, thirst, &amp;c. must bee taken figuratiuely. But what drunkennesse is it to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of these words only? This is my body, when all the wordes of Christ, as well figuratiue speeches, as proper, be spirite and life, as well as these. Yet now now we shall see a whole world of difference betweene the wordes of the Gospel &amp; the interpretation of false gospellers, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twen the old fathers &amp; y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> new brethren. For Christ (saith he) was by his incarnation made the bread of life to the end we might eate his godhead otherwise then the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers had done before. The newe brethren bid vs feede vpon him by faith alone, as Noe &amp; Abraham did. I trust it shalbe sufficient to proue those new brethren, to be y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> right children &amp; heires of those olde fathers, when they haue all one matter of saluation, the flesh and bloud of Christ, &amp; all one instrument of eating, faith alone. And why should the new brethren eate the godhead, or man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of Christ, otherwise in substance, then the olde fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers did? But Sander asketh, where is the word of God so giuen me after his incarnation, as it could not be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen before? And I aske Sander, wherfore it should bee giuen nowe otherwise then it was before? and why it could not be giuen before so as it is giuen now? but that he will binde the worde of God to a naturall course, &amp; not suffer his working to be free from earthly necessitie? He demandeth further, where is any euerlasting meat for his bodie? I demaund likewise, wher was any euerlasting meat for the bodie of Noe &amp; Abraham our fathers? But
<pb n="555" facs="tcp:13044:286"/>
Sander saith his flesh is rebellious to his spirite, and hath neede to be fedde, his bodie was the meane to poyson his soule, therefore his soule must haue a medicine, which shall be receiued into his bodie. I answere, the flesh of our olde fathers Noah and Abraham was rebellious to the spirite, had neede to be fed, were a meane to poyson the soule &amp;c, yet needed they not, that the flesh of Christ should be receiued into their bodies, that it might bee a medicine vnto their soules: no more is it needful for the newe brethren that are their children. But let vs see the other differences. Irenaeus reprooued them that denyed the resurrection of mens bodyes, because Godly men in scripture are called spirituall: the newe brethren wrest the name of spirite or spirituall bodie, to denie the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al substance of flesh in the sacrament: Nay, they inferre y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the maner of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> eating must be spiritual, in which respect it is called a spirituall bodie, and not onely for the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of quickning which it hath of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> spirit of Christ. But it is a great mysterie, that where S. Paul 1. Tim. 3. woulde haue Deacons to be chosen of such men, as haue the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterie of faith in a pure conscience, Sander thinketh, hee meaneth the Sacrament, which in their masse at the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secration of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bloud, is called <hi>mysterium sidei,</hi> &amp; in Iustinus time was deliuered by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Deacons. O blockish imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion! such be the arguments of poperie. But if it be so, why is not the breade so called in your Masse, as well as the cuppe? And if there bee a speciall reason why the cuppe shoulde rather bee so called, what conscience haue your Priests and Deacons to spoile y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> people therof, and not to deliuer it as the Deacons did in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> time of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinus? The other differences that without order he hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth and repeteth, come al to this end, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we deny the flesh of Christ any way to be profitable; y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we affirme y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> spirit to quicken vs, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out eating of Christ in his supper; we wrest to the spirit of man, that which Christ saith of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> spirit of god: al which is false &amp; sla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>derous, for as I haue ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.

If he haue any thing to shewe, we shall haue it hereafter. But it is a follie (he saith) vpon allegation of a thing so farre beyonde the memorie of man, as the primitiue Church is, to leaue the custome of the present Church, which Christ no lesse redeemed, gouerneth, and loueth, then he did the faithfull of the first sixe hundreth yeares. I answere shortly, that is not the Church of Christ, but of antichrist, which of late yeares hath taught, the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shiping of the sacrament, as God and man. And whereas, Sander replieth, that then we shall haue no quietnes or end of controuersies, if heretikes may appeale to the primitiue Church, as the Trinitaries in Poolande, and the Circumciders in Lithuania, for these appeale to the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitiue Church, and denie writings of Fathers and scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, as the Protestant: I answere, the Protestants re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue all the canonicall scriptures, by which all heresie may be condemned, the autoritie or practise of the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitiue Church, they alledge but as a witnesse of trueth, which is sufficient prooued out of the worde of God. Whereas he saith, there was but one vniuersall chaunge to bee looked for in religion, which was to be made by Christ: I affirme, the trueth of Christs religion to be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable, but there was an vniuersall chaunge to be looked for from Christes religion, to Antichrist, which saint Paul calleth an Apostasie, &amp; saint Iohn in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelation, the cuppe of fornication, whereof all nations should drinke &amp;c. Yet was not this chaunge so vniuersal, but that the seruants of God, though in small number and credit, with the world, were preserued out of that ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
<pb n="558" facs="tcp:13044:288"/>
apostasie, and called out of Babylon, as wee see it nowe come to passe, by the preaching of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall Gospel, then also foreshewed, Apocal. 14. 17. 18. &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Another reason, why we shoulde giue none eare to them, that say the words are figuratiue, is for that then wee shoulde doubt of our former faith, and in doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting become men that lacke faith. And why should you not onely doubt, but refuse a false opinion, beleeued contrarie to the worde of God? But wee must tell San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, whether hee that gaue eare first to Berengarius and Zwinglius, may giue eare to an other that shoulde say the Apostels had no authoritie to write holie Scriptures. No forsooth, for hee that gaue eare to Berengarius and Zwinglius, did heare them, because they brought the authoritie of scriptures, which is the onely certaine rule of truth, against which no question or doubt may be mooued. As for the opinion of carnall presence, if it had beene as generally receiued before Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rengarius, as Sander falsely affirmeth, yet it was lawfull to bring it to the triall of holy Scriptures, as we doe all the articles of our faith which are true, not so much because they are generally receiued, as for that they are manifestly approued, by the authoritie of the holy scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
                  <p>But Sander will yet enter farther, into the bowels of the cause, &amp; before he heare what reasons ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be brought against the popish faith, he saith the Sacramentaries can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not possiblie haue any grounde of their doctrine, that the wordes of Christ in the supper are figuratiue, either in respect of the worde written, or the faith of all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, or the glorie of God, or the loue of Christ toward vs, or the profite of his Church. Yes verilie, all these fiue respects, moue vs to take the wordes of Christ at his supper to be figuratiue. And, First the word writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by saint Luke, and saint Paul, This cuppe is the newe Testament in my bloude: which wordes being manifestly figuratiue, haue the same sense that the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="559" facs="tcp:13044:288"/>
rehearsed by Saint Matthewe, and Saint Marke, This is my bloude: and that these wordes haue, This is my bodie, which are vsed by all fower: Therefore by the written worde, they are all figuratiue and signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the deliuerie of a Sacrament or seale of the newe couenant established in the death and bloudshedding of the sonne of God.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the faith of all Christians, for sixe hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred yeares and more after Christe, hath beene suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently prooued to haue vnderstoode the wordes figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuely, for a figure, signe, token, pledge of the bodie and bloude of Christe, and not for the verie substance con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in formes of breade and wine. Insomuch, that the verie glosse vppon the Canon Lawe, <hi>De cons. dist.</hi> 2. <hi>Cap. Hoc est,</hi> hath these wordes, <q>
                        <hi>Coeleste Sacramentum quod verè representat Christi carnem, dicitur corpus Christi, sed impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priè: vnde dicitur suo modo, sed non in veritate sed significante mysterio, vt sit sensus, vocatur corpus Christi, id est significat.</hi> The heauenly Sacrament which truely representeth the fleshe of Christ, is called the bodie of Christ, but im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>properly. Whereof it is saide to bee after a peculyar manner, but not in trueth of the thing, but in a sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying mysterie: So that the sense is, it is called the bodie of Christe, that is to saye, it signifieth it.</q> The au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of this glosse, durst not haue written thus, if it had not beene an opinion generally receiued, that the wordes of Christ were not proper, but figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue.</p>
                  <p>Thirdely it is against the glorie of GOD that the bodie of Christ, shoulde be so made present, as it should enter not onely into the mouth of wicked persons, as a deade bodie working no life, but also into the bellyes of brute beastes, which is euen horrible to name.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly it is not agreeable to the loue of Christ to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward vs in his second comming, that his bodie by such a presence shoulde bee thought to haue lost all natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall conditions of a substantiall bodie, seeing the
<pb n="560" facs="tcp:13044:289"/>
scripture putteth vs in hope, that our vile bodies shall be made confirmable at his comming to his glorious body, Philip. 3. Wherefore that heresie of carnall presence, is contrarie to our faith of the resurrection of our bodies.</p>
                  <p>Fiftly, it is against the profite of Christes Church, which by his ascension is drawen vpward into heauen from the earth, but by this imagined presence, is mooued to looke downe vnto Christ vpon the earth. Col. 3. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in all these respects, the exposition of the wordes must be figuratiue.</p>
                  <p>Another reason Sander hath, that seeing all figures were inuented either for lacke of words, or for pleasant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of speaking, and Christ neither lacked wordes nor can be prooued to haue spoken figuratiuely, onely for his pleasure, therefore he spake not figuratiuely. If there be no more causes of figuratiue speach, then these two noted by Sander, then Christ neuer vsed any figuratiue speaches, for hee neuer wanted wordes, to haue spoken properly that other men could speake properly, neither can he be prooued to haue spoken figuratiuely, only for his pleasure, and least of all, he affected the praise of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loquence. But if it be out of question: &amp; Sander also co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesseth, that in other places, Christ spake figuratiuely, then is it out of question, that this argument of Sander is not worth the paring of his nayles. For there are other causes of figuratiue speaches, then these two by him al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, and especially the profite of the hearers, who are more moued, and better vnderstande often times by fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guratiue, then by proper speaches. And for this cause, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> holy ghost speaking of Sacraments, doth vsually call the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (figuratiuely, by the names of that they signifie &amp; seale vnto vs, as the Lamb is called y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Passeouer, baptisme rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, the bread his bodie, the cuppe the newe Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.

                  <p>Of Saint Augustines rule of figuratiue speaches, San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that loueth no repetitions, hath written a whole
<pb n="561" facs="tcp:13044:289"/>
Chapter before, lib. 3. Cap. 14. and therefore I will say no more of it here, onely I note that by quoting the place, hee abuseth Augustines rule, against his owne example which he bringeth of eating and drinking the body and bloud of Christ, to proue that Christes wordes are not fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guratiue, when Augustine saith expresly, those wordes are figuratiue which Christe spake of eating and drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king his flesh and bloud.</p>
                  <p>The rocke was Christ, (he sayeth) must needes be a figuratiue speach, because it can not be proper. And for the same cause, say we, These wordes. This is my body, are figuratiue, for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they can not be proper. But Sander replieth, that <hi>if he had saide, this breade is my body, it might haue beene so thought, for breade cannot bee his body no more then the rocke be Christ.</hi> yet S. Paul doubteth not, to say, this bread, of that of which before he had said, this is my bodie. 1. Cor. 11. And I aske Sander, what was that which Christ had in his hand, and whereof he said this? It coulde not be his bodie, before the words of consecration spoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as all Catholike papists affirme: then it was bread, then, the word following Is, will not suffer the sense to be, this shalbe my body, wherefore in effect it is all one to say, hauing bread in his hand, This is my body, and to say, This bread is my body, the one is impossible by Sanders confession: <hi>ergo</hi> by necessitie of argument the other.</p>

Therefore looke what woulde be the sense of those wordes, the same will bee the sense of these wordes, taking the speaches either as proper, or figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratiue.</p>
                  <p>But Christ (saith he) <hi>hath forced vs to seeke out this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation in causing Saint Luke and S. Paul to write, This Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice is the newe Testament in my bloud. For of necessitie wee must interpret these wordes, This Chalice, that is to say, the thing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in this Chalice, is my bloud.</hi> I pray you sir what neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie? except the speach be figuratiue. You will say it is figuratiuely onely for the cuppe, to signifie that which is contained therein. If you so say, then tell mee once againe, whether these wordes, The newe Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in my bloude, bee all one in proper speach, with these wordes, my bloude. If the newe Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament in my bloude, bee all one in sense, with these wordes my bloude, they are figuratiue: for no man properlie vseth so to speake, that hee na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth the newe Testament in his bloude, when hee nameth nothing, but his bloude naturally. If these wordes bee figuratiue, not onelie in the name of cuppe, but in the wordes following, whiche are, is the newe Testament in my bloude: then the wordes of the supper are founde to bee figuratiue, and all the babling about This, and Is, and bodie, and bloude, and mine, &amp;c. are vaine and foolish: for This and Is, are in this figuratiue speech, and that in one manner of speaking is called, My bloude, in an other, is called the newe Testament in my bloude, and by necessarie analogie, that whiche in one man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of speech is vttered by these wordes, My bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, may and ought truely to bee vnderstoode and
<pb n="564" facs="tcp:13044:291"/>
vttered in these wordes: The new Testament in my bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die crucified. That the Pronowne <hi>hoc,</hi> is the Neuter gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and <hi>hic</hi> the Masculine gender, it prooueth not the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration of substance, for the genders followe the names, and note no substantiall propertie, where the thinges differ not in the sexe. But where you saide first, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowne pointeth to the visible formes, nowe you say it pertaineth rather to the Substantiue (bodie) where it en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, then to the formes, you are not onely contrarie to your selfe, but also to the schoolemen, which say it poin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth to neither of both, but vnto <hi>indiuiduum vagum,</hi> a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular vncertaine or wandering thing. But point it as you will, it can haue no true literall sense, if you will holde your owne principles: for if the bodie bee not present before the wordes of consecration vttered, as all papists (I thinke) except Sander, will affirme: That which hee had in his hande was breade, at that instant, when hee saide, This. And Sander himselfe saith: <hi>This which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to them breade, to bee in substance at the ending of the wordes, His owne bodie: Ergo</hi> it was not so before the wordes ended, and howe can, is, a Verbe of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent tense, signifie that which shall bee after, although it bee neuer so soone after? But of the Pronowne This, wee shall haue occasion to speake in three Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters following, and diuerse times it is repeted in this booke, although hee protest in the Preface that he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted not to speake one thing twise.</p>

Christ saith not, This is in my body, but this is my bodie, which is a blockish reason, for Christ saith, This is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> new Testament, which is an Accident, &amp; in my bloud, as well as This is my bloude. Well, the Protestants opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion is (saith he) that This pointeth to the bread and the wine, which signifie his bodie &amp; bloud. But that cannot be, because this cannot agree with breade and wine, neither in Greeke nor Latine, and then telleth vs, the genders of the nownes, &amp;c. But good Sir: the pronowne This, is the newter gender, put absolutely, comprehending in signification that thing, which was shewed, which needed not to bee called breade and wine, because it was so to bee iudged by the bodilie senses. But then (saith Sander) you <hi>correct the wordes of Christ, as though he had said, This which is breade, is my bodie, and then euerie substance of bread shoulde signifie his bodie.</hi> He that giueth the true meaning of Christes wordes, doeth not correct them, neither doe wee referre the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowne This, to the generall substance of breade, but affirme, that it demonstrateth that breade onely, which he at that time tooke for to make thereof a Sacrament. And whereas it is translated in Latine: <hi>Hic est sanguis,</hi> the Greeke retaineth the Newter gender. And an Adie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiue betweene two Substantiues of diuerse genders, maie agree with either of them, but that the Pronowne This, is to bee referred to the wine, the other Euan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelistes doe shewe, which vtter it thus, this cuppe, that is, the wine in this cuppe. And whereas Cyprian sayeth, <hi>haec est caro mea,</hi> hee might aswell haue said, poin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to bread, <hi>hoc est caro mea,</hi> or <hi>hic panis est caro mea,</hi> and yet his words, as he vttereth them, haue none other mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, euen as Moses speaking of the rainbowe in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of GOD, saith, <hi>Hoc est signum foederis, &amp;c.</hi> This is the signe of the couenaunt, where <hi>hoc</hi> agreeing in gender, with <hi>signum,</hi> doeth yet demonstrate the raine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bowe, which is there a Nowne of the Masculine gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>

Sir, our haste is not so great, but we can stay a much longer time to knowe our masters meaning: But seeing you beare vs in hande, that one substance is made of another, by these wordes spoken, which aske a time in speaking, and you your selues determine at what instant the change is soudenly made al at once, and would proue the same by the Pronowne This, and euery other of the wordes, you must giue vs leaue to consider euery moment of time, in which they are spoken.

The preface he speaketh of, are these words of Christ: I haue desired with desire to eate this Passeouer with <note place="margin">Fulk.</note> you, before I die. Which words he forceth not whether they be referred to the old Paschal lambe, or to the new. If they be referred to the newe, Christ desireth onely to eate his owne bodie with his Apostles, as Chrysostome sayeth, to encourage them not to bee afraide thereof, which he could not doe by faith onely, therefore he did it really, wherein is none absurditie to eate it, Angels feede of it, seeing other men haue eaten their own flesh in a grosse manner, either for hunger, or for anger, or phansie, &amp;c. To this I answere: first if a lyar could al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes remember himselfe, it shoulde skill to Sanders purpose, that these wordes should not be referred to the newe Sacrament, for then Christ in calling it, this pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call lambe, or Passeouer, should begin to speake figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuely.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, I marueile, why he saith, it is a thing cleane impossible, that Christ should eate it by faith. How did he at other times eate the Paschal lambe? did he not eate it with faith? how was he baptized? did he not also be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue? Although Christ partaking the Sacramentes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted for sinful men, had a singular manner of parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, which no man else had, that is for the profite of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, &amp; not himselfe, who needed them not, yet there is no doubt, but bearing our person, he did partake them with faith. For, of whome is it saide? he trusted in God, &amp;c. Psa. 22. And to that which Sander sayeth, he did eate of it, as Angels feede of it, (which cannot be corporally, but spiritually:) I agree with him, that it is no absur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie, so he will graunt mee two things: the one, that he did none otherwise eate his bodie in the supper, then he was borne againe in baptisme. The other, that it will suffise him, that we so eate the bodie of Christ, as An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels feede of it, which are thereby nourished and esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished in eternall life, and yet cannot receiue his body corporally into their spirites. As for the argument ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of other men, eating their owne flesh, for hunger, anger, or phansie, to prooue that it is no absurditie for
<pb n="573" facs="tcp:13044:295"/>
Christ to eate his owne flesh corporally, is verie absurd. For a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>, or phansie, yet was it an absurditie for them so to doe. Then of an argument, which is <hi>Consentaneum,</hi> to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude negatiuely, it may be called <hi>absurdum absurdorum.</hi> Againe, if it had beene none absurditie for men to eate their owne flesh, for hunger, anger, or phansie, yet no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> did euer eate his whole bodie: and therefore the absur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie of Christ eating his owne bodie after that manner, is not by their example auoided.</p>
                  <p>But if the desire of Christ (saith he) be referred to the old Paschal Lambe, yet was it in respect, that at the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding thereof, the newe might be instituted, which Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostome calleth the trueth, that was perfourmed when the figure was past, in Psa. 37. Lo Christ desireth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> trueth, which is his owne substance, which is the onely meate, wherein God taketh pleasure. To this I answere, a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire is, of that which is absent, Christes substance of his flesh was neuer absent, since his incarnation: therefore it was not that which he desired, but another trueth of the olde figures, namely, the sacrifice of his death, of which the Apostle sayeth: Christ our Passeouer is slaine &amp; of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered vp. 1. Cor. 5. Againe, where he saieth, his owne sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance vnited to his godhead, is the onely meate where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in God taketh pleasure, he speaketh contrarie to Christ, which saith, My meate is to doe the will of my father, and finish his worke, which was brought to passe in his suffering, which also he nameth expressely in the wordes of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> preface. It was the last Passeouer, that hee did eate, before his suffering, so that this circumstance maketh nothing for the bodily presence.</p>

That a great &amp; vnacustomed matter was done in the house, so found by miracle, we confesse, but that proueth not that Christs speech was proper, because it was not abroad in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> temple or synagogue, but in a close parlour. But where Sander saith, Christ gaue to euery one of his Apostles a

loafe, vnder the forme whereof, his owne substance was conteined, it is against y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> scripture, which saieth, he brake the bread, he gaue them, against Cyrillus, which saith he gaue them pieces of bread, against reason, that euery one should eate a loaf of bread, although they wer but smal, when they had supped twise before in that euening, at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Paschall Lamb, &amp; at an ordinarie supper. But if the table be real (saith Sander) much more the meat is reall. Wee denie not, but the meat is real: that is real bread &amp; wine to the bodie, and the bodie and bloud of Christ to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued of the soule: for, if al things be reall, why should not the bread and wine be reall?</p>

                     <note place="margin">Fulke.</note> 
                     <hi>he did not sanctifie.</hi> Yes, he touched Iudas lippes with his lippes, yet did he not sanctifie them. But he sanctified y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bread &amp; wine to the vse of his supper. Neither went the vertue from him (as Sander saieth) by touching of his garments, but by faith, for many at the same time, did not only touch him, but thrust &amp; throng him, yet they all receiued not vertue from him. Secondly, he tooke vnleauened bread, which was alreadie figuratiue bread: therfore he goeth not about to doe that was done alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, to make it figuratiue bread. I answer, the Paschall Lamb was eaten, and therefore the bread was common bread, although vnleauened, which was to be eaten se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen dayes after. But what letteth, if it once figured one thing, but that he might take it to make it a figure of an other thing? for Saint Paul sheweth that it figured sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceritie and trueth: nowe it is a seale of the remission of finnes, by the death of Christ.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly, Christ taking bread and wine, pointeth not to his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles, as though he would consecrate somewhat in their breasts, (as Caluine dreameth) but in breade and wine, wee must seeke the first worke of his supper.</hi> And therefore, Sander dreameth, that Christ meant to consecrate nothing in the Apostles brestes. He begon with taking bread and wine, <hi>ergo</hi> he did worke nothing in the Apostles breastes. A sounde reason, I promise you.</p>

Last of all, this putteth vs in minde of that great Priest Melchisedek, as Cyprian teacheth. But the Apostle writing to the Hebrues, could haue taught vs more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teinly, if he could haue seene any such comparison be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene Christ and Melchizedeck. Heb. 7. And euery sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice (saith he) is changed in substance from the former nature it had, sometime killed, sometime burned, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time eaten: therefore Christ must change the breade &amp; wine into his bodie and bloud. If we should admitte a sacrifice (as most of the olde writers call the celebration of the supper a sacrifice of thankesgiuing) verily the change by eating and drinking, were sufficient to make it answere to the change required in a sacrifice, without transubstantiation, which was not vsed in any sacrifice.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>First, when Christ blesseth, it is not necessarie, that hee should make any outward token of lifting vp his eyes or <note place="margin">Fulk.</note> handes, and least of all, with making the signe of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> crosse, as Sander dreameth waking.

Although what blessing meaneth in this place, the other Euangelistes do declare, which call his blessing, thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuing. And yet I denie not, but Christ blessed the bread and wine, which he sanctified, to be a diuine sacrament of his bodie and bloud, for the assurance of remission of sinnes, by the newe testament, which is established in his bloud.</p>

                  <p>The best thankes (saith he) are those, that are giuen in <note place="margin">Sander.</note> worde and deede: therefore Christ gaue not thankes fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guratiuely, <note place="margin">Fulke.</note> neither be the wordes of thankesgiuing fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guratiue, as the Sacramentaries saye: The wordes in

which Christ gaue thankes, are not expressed, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Sacramentaries saie not that they are either figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratiue or proper. But Sander would haue these wordes, This is my bodie, to be the wordes of thankesgiuing, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause Irenaeus saith, <hi>Panem, in quo gratiae act<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

That Christ gaue thankes to God both in worde and deede, not onlie at this time, but at all times, there is no question: for in all things hee was obedient to his father, euen to the most curssed and shamefull death of the Crosse: neither was it necessarie, that he should make transubstantiation, so often as he gaue thankes in worde and deede. Neither are those our ancestors, which denied the sacrament of Eucharistie or thankesgiuing, of whom Igna<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tius spake: for wee both receiue it, and beleeue it to bee the fleshe and bloud of Christe, in such sense as hee meant it, and as Ignatius tooke his meaning.</p>

                     </hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>First Sander findeth fault with the order of wordes <note place="margin">Fulke.</note> vsed by all the Euangelistes, in placing breaking, before the wordes of consecration, because Saint Paul sayeth the breade which we breake, is the communion of the bodie of Christ: which is no good argument: for Saint Paul thereby sheweth, that the bread is not altered from his substance, although it be vsed for a Sacrament of our spirituall communication of Christ with vs, and of vs one with another. 1. Cor. 10. But he will salue the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, by saying, the Euangelistes first ioyne all the deeds of Christ together, and then expresse his wordes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="578" facs="tcp:13044:298"/>
The deeds, he saith, are taking bread, blessing, thanksgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, deliuering: mark y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> here he maketh blessing, &amp; tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ks giuing to be only deeds, which imediatly before he affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to be by saying, This is my body. But howsoeuer our aduersaries are pleased w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> all (saith he) let it go for a truth, that Christ did breake, and giue, after the words of consecration. Thus when he hath nothing to prooue it, a starke lye must goe for a truth, contrary to the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der obserued by all the Euangelistes, because that order is contrary to Popery, and the Popishe custome, which first consecrateth, and then breaketh. But taking it for a truth: the breaking of that which appeared bread, doth shew Christ to be wholy conteined in euery piece there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, whereas Christ eaten onely by faith, is receiued ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> measure of euery mans faith, which is more or lesse, contrary to the figure of Manna. I answer, whole Christ is receiued by euery one, that receiueth the bread and wine in what quantitie soeuer, although Christ be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowe not his graces equally. For Christ doeth dwell in our hearts by faith: <hi>ergo</hi> he is wholy present by faith, Eph. 3.</p>
                  <p>And this meaneth Hieronyme in the place by Sander cited <hi>aduers. Iouin li.</hi> 2. after he had spoken of Manna. <hi>Et not &amp;c. And wee also take the bodie of Christe equally. There is one sanctification in the mysteries of the master and ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant, &amp;c. although according to the merites of the rec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers, that is made diuers, which is one.</hi> By merites, Hierom meaneth not workes, but worthines of faith, by which the grace of God is effectuall vnto good workes, in some more than in other. Neither hath Eusebius Emisse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus aniething contrarie to this meaning, <hi>Homil. 5. in Pasch. Hoc corpus &amp;c.</hi> This bodie when the prieste mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistreth, is as greate in the small peece, as in the whole loafe. Of this bread when part is taken, euery man hath no lesse, then altogether: one hath all: twaine hath all: moe haue all, without diminishing.</p>
                  <p>These words (saith Sander) cannot be vnderstanded
<pb n="579" facs="tcp:13044:298"/>
of materiall bread, nor of inward grace, neither of which are equally receiued. But yet Christ and a seale of this redemption is equally receiued, without change of the bread into Christ. For Eusebius speaketh of breade and a whole loaf, as Sander himselfe translateth, bread is not the name of accidentes, neither was there euer heard of a loafe of accidentes of bread: nor of breaking of acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentes of bread, before the Laterane Councell. But what saith Germanus Archb. of Constantinople? <hi>Post eleuatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem, &amp;c. after the eleuation, by &amp; by, a partition of the diuine lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of is made. But truly although he be diuided into partes, yet he is acknowledged and found vndiuided, vncutt, and whole in euery parte of the thinges, that are cutt.</hi> Where he saith, the diuine body is parted, he meaneth the bread, which is called his body, for the Greekes to this day, doe not acknowledg transubstantiation. Although the authoritye of Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manus bee not worth the standing vpon, beeing but a late writer of a corrupt time.</p>
                  <p>But what speake I of fathers, saieth Sander? The breade which wee breake, is it not the communicating of our Lordes body? Because wee being many, are one bread, one body. For so much as wee all partake of the one breade. If the breade bee broken, (saith he) how partake wee all of one breade? that which is bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, is not one in number. No sir, but it was one in number before it was broken, whereof when euery one receiued a parte, wee vnderstand that wee all pertaine to one whole. But the Corinthians (saith he) haue more then one loafe broken among them. How prooue you that, sir? the wordes of Paul seeme otherwise, and if they had twentie loaues, yet was it al one bread in kind, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the Apostle saide, wee all partake of one breade: which if it be not materiall breade, how is it broken? for the body of Christ is not broken. And Saint Paul, saying wee partake all of one bread, which is broken, meaneth not y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the visible Sacrament, is nothing els but many accidentes, and no breade at all.</p>

I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere, he gaue a Sacrament, and his flesh at his supper, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Sacrament were not perfect in euerie singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar action that belonged to it, but in the whole. Where he sayeth, the meate of Christes supper came from his hands, and that it is horrible blasphemie, to say it came another way, because he onely sayeth it, it shall suffice plainly to denie it.

denie the Sacrifice pretended: yet Christ at other times, gaue thankes for bodily meate, much more nowe for spirituall food of the soule, as the Sacrament is, beeing worthily receiued.</p>
                  <p>As for Melchisedek his Sacrifice in breade and wine, we finde none that he offered to God, but a refreshing to Abraham, whome in deede he blessed as the Priest of God, and so hath Christ blessed vs with eternall happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes. Therefore all this babling of Sander, that Christ offered bread and wine, to his father, which were all one as if a man should offer to a Prince a fatte Oxe, and giue him in a paper writen, this is a fat Oxe, &amp;c. is not worth one Goates heare. Christ offered but one Sacrifice propitiatorie, and that but once, shedding his bloud, the great mystery of which redemption, he deliuered to his Apostles in the outwarde creatures of breade and wine. But let vs see, howe he prooueth, that these wordes are not figuratiue.</p>
                  <p>First Ambrose saith: In the diuine consecration, the selfe wordes of our Lorde and Sauiour doe worke, and Chrysostome saith, that by this word, This is my body, the thinges set forth, are consecrated. but figuratiue wordes worke nothing, therefore they are not figuratiue. This <hi>minor</hi> is a starke lye often times confuted: These wordes in the very institution of the supper, are figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue, This is the new Testament in my bloud, and yet worke as much as these, This is my body. Likewise the wordes of Christ, are spirite and life, therefore not figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratiue, is a beastly argument, vnworthy answering, which wold denie al figuratiue speches to be y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> words of Christ. As blockish and brockish it is, that in these 4. words <hi>Hoc est corpus meum,</hi> we leaue neuer a one in his own sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification, plucking them from their gender and case, when we expound it thus: This doth signifie my bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, which is a toy to mocke with an Ape. For who can expound a sentence in other wordes to keepe the same case, and gender, and kinde of wordes alwaies?</p>
                  <p>But it is a weighty matter, that Sander hath obserued
<pb n="586" facs="tcp:13044:302"/>
in Saint Paules order of wordes, placing the Pronowne <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                     </gap>, vttering the wordes after this manner. This of me is the bodie: whereas the other Euangelistes say, This is the bodie of me. Verily, there is not here so much oddes, as betweene a milhorse, and an horsemill. But what is the great mysterie, that lyeth in this obseruation? forsooth it giueth coniecture (such as in the order of words may be had) that the Pronowne This, onely resteth and endeth his signification in the substantine Bodie, and cannot be referred vnto Bread. For it were an hard speech to say: this bread of me is the signe of bodie. But if I say, this bread doeth signifie of me the bodie, what other sense hath it, then if I saye, this bread doeth signifie the bodie of mee? I blame not San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der for scanning narrowly whatsoeuer is vttered in the scripture: but in vrging the composition of the Greeke speech, which is not like the English tongue, where there is no difference in sense, seeing the Latine composition w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

But what if wee expound it thus, <hi>Hoc est corpus meum, id est, figura corporis mei</hi> (as Tertullian doeth) and reteining the gender of the Relatiue, say, <hi>quod pro vobis datur,</hi> This is a figure of my bodie, which bodie is giuen for you?</p>

Sander hath his answere readie, that the relatiue must repete his whole antecedent, which cannot haue at once both a proper and vnproper meaning. What coulde Priscian, or Aristarchus haue vttered more learnedlie?</p>

First because the 14. day at euening hee began the blessed sacrifice of his passion. Secondly, hee hath offered the olde Paschal Lambe, the chiefe sacrifice of the Lawe. These two circumstances, shew it was time to go about his only sacrifice on y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> crosse, they proue not y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he offered another sacrifice at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> table. Thirdly hetoke breade and wine into his handes, part of the sacrifice of Melchisedek. I answere, the scripture telleth vs not of any such sacrifice of Melchisedek. Fourthly, he blessed and gaue thankes, wherein he consecrateth his owne bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, the onely sacrifice of mankinde. I answere, his owne bodie had no neede of consecration: hee consecrated breade to bee a sacrament of his bodie, which was not the onely sacrifice for mankind, which was but once and no more offered, or to be offered. Not that he should of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes offer vp himselfe, saith the Apostle. Heb. 9. ver. 25. wherefore his commaundement <hi>hoc facite,</hi> doe this, is
<pb n="590" facs="tcp:13044:304"/>
not to make a sacrifice of Christs bodie, which hee made not. But Cyptian (saith Sander) taketh the verbe <hi>facere</hi> so, <q>lib. 2. Ep. 3. <hi>Iesus Christus &amp;c.</hi> Iesus Christ our Lord and God himself is the hiest priest of God the father, and first hath offered sacrifice vnto God the father, <hi>Et hoc fieri <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                        <hi>vtique ille saccrdos vice Christi verè fungitur qui id quod Christus fecit, imitatur &amp;c:</hi> Verily that Priest doth truely supply the roome of Christ, which imitateth that which Christ hath done: and then he offereth a true and full sacrifice to God the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the Church, if he so begin to offer, according as he may see Christ himselfe to haue offered.</q> Nay, that Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian meaneth not that Christ in his supper did offer his owne bodie in sacrifice to his father, for redemption of he worlde, but onely a sacrifice of thankesgiuing, and commaunded the same to bee kept in remembrance of his passion. Cyprian himselfe testifieth in the same Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle. <q>
                        <hi>Et quia passionis eius mentionem in sacrificijs omnibus facimus (passio est enim domini sacrificium quod offerimus) nihil aliud quàm quod ille fecit facere debemus.</hi> And because wee make mention of his passion, in all sacrifices (for the sacrifice which wee offer, is the passion of our Lorde) wee ought to doe nothing, but that which hee himselfe did.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Note heere the sacrifice which Cyprian offered, was the passion of Christ: as well as the bodie of Christ, but it was not the passion of Christ properly, therefore it was not the bodie of Christ properly. I might alleage other places out of that Epistle, to refell the impudencie of Sander: but this is sufficient, that neither <hi>facere</hi> in Cypri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, signifieth to sacrifice, neither the bodie of Christ was otherwise sacrificed of him, then as it suffered in his sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice.</p>

Cap. 2. Adam saith of the woman: <hi>Hoc nunc os ex ossibus meis &amp; caro de carne mea, haec vocabitur virago.</hi> This is nowe bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh, she shalbe called woman.

I might multiply examples, infinitely, if these were not sufficient to shewe the vanitie of Sander, which of the gender of the pronowne, would prooue the speach not to be figuratiue. Where hee saith, we builde a roofe without walls or foundation, as Hierom saith of heretikes, that neglecting y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> literal sense, builded al their fantasies vpon allegories: I answere, we doe not so but rather the Papists, which builde a sacrament without an element, denying breade and wine to remaine in the sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, as for the literall sense of scripture, we beleeue to be the onely true sense, although the words many times bee vnproper and figuratiue, euen as Sander himselfe both in his rotten Rocke, and in this booke taketh, this to be the literall sense of these words, I will giue thee the Keyes of the kingdome of heauen, meaning authoritie.</p>
                  <p>What the new testament is whereof the holy <note place="margin">Sander.</note> scripture speaketh.</p>
                  <p>A testame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t (he saith) is a solemn ordeining of a thing by <note place="margin">Fulke.</note>

words confirmed by death of the testator, dedicated with a sacrifice, offered to God bloudily. The newe Testament is a couenant or truse made by Christ with vs, to haue forgiuenesse of sinnes, if we keepe his lawe. The bloude of the old Testament was put in a basen, the bloude of the newe Testament in a Chalice. I omit, that hee saith, the promise of the old Testament was but of a tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall inheritance, for keeping the lawe. But to returne to the newe Testament, which he so handleth, that there is neither rime nor reason in his argument. Three things (saith hee) are required in a solemne Testament, the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenant, bloudshedding, and application of the bloude. When Christ saieth, This is my bloude of the newe testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, either all these, or one of these may bee called the newe testament. <hi>But when saint Luke, and saint Paul reporte Christ to haue saide, This cuppe is the newe testament in my bloud, they seeme</hi> (saith hee) <hi>to take the worde Testament, for the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of the thing which doth confirme the new testament, &amp; not properly for the newe truse or promise thereof.</hi> What say you, Sander? is there any vnproper speech in the words of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secration? is a substance expressed by the name of an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident? where be the nownes, pronownes, verbs, &amp; patici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples; where be the relatiues, antecedents, cases and gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, that fight for the proper sense of <hi>hoc est corpus meum?</hi> why serue they not heere? But heare a little more. This that is in the Chalice (saith he) is not the promise of remitting sinnes, but it is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> new testament in Christes bloud: That is to say, it is the thing that confirmeth the newe lawe. Why sir? euen now you told vs that it might be called a new testament, as it is a law, couenant, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise. Will you make vs beleeue, that the Euangelistes reporting one saying of Christ, which can haue but one sense, in the one of them the newe testament is taken for a promise; in the other it is not taken for a promise? But let it bee the thing that confirmeth the promise: what thing is that I pray you? His bloud, you will say. Why then, the sense of these words, the newe testament in my bloude, is my bloude in my bloude. This cuppe is my bloude in my bloude: What sense is this? But Sedulius

I trow helpeth you much in 1. Co. 11. <hi>Ideo colix &amp;c.</hi> Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Chalice is called the testament, because it did beare witnesse that the passion should bee soone after, &amp; now it testifieth that it is done: although you are faine to alter the common reading, &amp; to put in <hi>testamentum</hi> for <hi>testamenti.</hi> How prooue you by these wordes, that Sedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius was of your minde? Alas he hath nothing to say, but being taken with a figuratiue speach, he slinketh away like a Dogge that is whipped, with his taile betweene his legges. For these wordes of Christ, This cuppe is the newe testament in my bloude: if all the Gramma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians in the worlde haue them in hande, to construe, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not haue a Grammaticall sense, but must needes bee ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken figuratiuely, and being so taken, chaseth transub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiation out of the doores, for the true sense of them can be none other, but this. This cuppe is a seale of the newe testament established in my bloude, which is shed for the remission of sinnes, and the like vnderstanding must needes be of these words, This is my bodie.</p>

                     </gap>t confirmeth the newe testament, but that is reall bloude, <note place="margin">Fulke.</note> therefore this is reall bloude, saith Sander. I answere, the argument is naught, because in one proposition, the speach is figuratiue, in the other proper. But he repli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that the olde testament, had none other thing to signifie the bloude thereof, but the bloude of Calues, therefore the newe testament hath nothing but the bloude of Christ. I answere, the bloude of Calues and Goates was it selfe a figure of the bloude of Christe, by which the newe testament is confirmed, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, there was no figure of that bloude to bee made. Heb. 9.</p>
                  <p>But S. Luke and S. Paul, by reciting the words other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, doe so euidently name bloud in the proper signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, that no reasonable man will say, that the name
<pb n="598" facs="tcp:13044:308"/>
of bloude standeth figuratiuely for the signe of bloude, saying, this cuppe is the newe testament in my bloude. In deede I confesse in this sentence, the worde bloud, sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth properly, the bloude of Christ, shedde vpon the crosse, which is that bloude which answereth the bloud of the olde Testament and not that which is in the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice. But then the former wordes: This cup is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> newe te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament, are figuratiue, for in proper manner of speaking the cuppe was not, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e is not, the new testament, but a sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament or signe thereof, which newe testament was confirmed by the bloude of Christe powred forth in sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice vpon the crosse. This one sworde is sufficient to cut the throate of transubstantiation &amp; carnall presence: for as much as Saint Luke and Saint Paul, giue the true sense of these wordes, This is my bloude, which is shedde for you, which in effect is thus much to say, this is the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament or seale of the newe testament established by shedding of my bloude on the crosse. But Sander can see nothing in Saint Luke and Saint Paul, but bloude taken properly, whereby he woulde prooue, that in the speech reported by the other Euangelists, bloud should not be taken figuratiuely, which is as good an argument as this. Bloud in the exposition of a figuratiue speech, is taken properly, therefore in figuratiue speech it selfe, it is not taken figuratiuely.</p>

The supper, as Augustine sayeth
<pb n="599" facs="tcp:13044:308"/>

Otherwise, there is nothing in his writing to warrant transubstantiation.</p>

<pb n="601" facs="tcp:13044:309"/>
liquor in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cuppe of Christes banket was not shed for vs. That Euthymius a late gatherer, referreth these wordes of shedding for vs, to the cuppe, I force not, and yet hee meaneth the cuppe to be his bloud not really, but Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally, euen as his bloud is not there shedde really, except the Papistes will now giue ouer their old distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of vnbloudy Sacrifice, to saye that the bloud of Christ is shedd forth in the Sacrament, as Sander saieth it was presently shedde in a mysterie, and the next daye shedde naturally. What misty speech is this? The natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall bloud of Christ is shedde in a mystery, if we speake after that manner, the reall body and bloud of Christ is present in a mysterye, eaten and drunken in a mysterye, &amp;c. he crieth out that we build a roofe without a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the naturall maner of presence and receiuing. But he must be admonished that the Greek word is <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, signifying which is shedd forth, and simply shedd, and therfore the word hath relation to the bloud which in his passion was shedde forth of his bodie. which shed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding forth of his bodye, if Sander will confesse to be in his Masse, he must vtterly renownce the vnbloudy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, so much prated of among the Papistes, for what els is a bloudy Sacrifice, but that whereof the bloud is powred out or shedde forth?</p>

Because Sander con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesseth that this circumstance aboue doth not prooue the reall presence, I will take his confession, It may not be denied but that Christ song or saied the hymne at other times, although it be expressed but this once. And if it were certeine, that this was the first and last that he song with them, yet there might be greate and sufficient cause

of his ioyfull thankesgiuing at this time, wherein hee made an ende of the old ceremonie, and hauing institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a newe sacrament of thankesgiuing, was euen the same night to beginne his passion, which was the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall caufe of his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming into the world for the redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of mankinde.

The chalice of bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing which wee blesse, is it not the communicating of Christs bloud<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And the breade which wee breake, is it not the communicating of the bodie of our Lord? Of these sentences Sander will conferre euerie word toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther which is not the right order of conference of scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to conferre the wordes whereof some are proper, some are figuratiue: but to conferre the Logicall sense of diuers places together, which either are both mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest in their seueral senses, or else may be made open by the circumstances of the places. But to folowe Sanders conference. In the first sentence he saith, <hi>The bread which I will giue,</hi> is described in the supper, by these wordes, Take, eate (this:) and in S. Paul is called, The breade which wee breake. But I vtterly denie, that the wordes of Christ in Saint Iohn, are all one with those of the supper. And therefore the referring of this to an eateable thing or foode &amp;c is not shewed by that conference. But S. Paul and Christ. Matth. 26. speake in deede both of one

                     </q> And according to the heauenly part which is the body of Christ, by the Papists confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, it tarieth not in the wicked, nor in the godly in sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, but in effect as Sander tolde before, therefore Christ in S. Iohn speaketh not of the sacramentall meate.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the breaking of the bread, which is done be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the wordes which the Papistes account the onely wordes of consecration can shewe the pronowne this, to signifie no materiall substance but breade: although Sander affirme, the breaking to be after, because it is so vsed in the popish Masse. Againe when the Apostle saith the bread which we break, he speaketh plainly of a thing that is broken actually, but so is not the body of Christ: as for Sanders shift of that foode, and that eatable thing, which we breake, is but a cloake of words, for if y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> foode be the natural bodie of Christ, and that foode is natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly broken, then the naturall bodie of Christ, is natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and really broken. Last of all, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> conference of this and this cuppe, to prooue that this, meaneth generally y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance vnder this, is not worth a chippe, for these wordes this cuppe, do not meane a generall metaphysicall sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, but the wine in this cuppe which is also called the fruit of the vine, and therfore This in the other saying, signifieth y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> substance only, which was in his hand, which was bread, and by their owne doctrine could be no other substance but bread, before <hi>hoc est corpus meum</hi> were saide all out, ouer it. The verbe, is, in the words of Christ, The bread which I will giue, is my flesh, although it respect the naturall flesh of Christ, yet it prooueth not, that the verbe, is, in the supper must be referred to the sonne, more then the same verbe in Saint Paul the Rocke was Christ: yet because you may see what a foolish
<pb n="604" facs="tcp:13044:311"/>
conference Sander maketh of wordes, I will reason with him in his owne sense, and ouerthrowe him in his owne conference.</p>
                  <p>I say not (saith Sander) that the bread shalbe, but the bread is my flesh. If the bread is his flesh, then his flesh is the bread: and if the worde, bread, signifie an eatable thing, as we haue bene often told, then y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> flesh of Christ is an eatable thing, when he so saith: and consequently, the flesh of Christ, which he said he would giue for the life of the world, might be eaten before the institution of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Sacrament. The word co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municating, is the next matter of conference, which being vsed of S. Paul, doeth inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prete the verbe Is, to signifie a substantiall, and not an accidentall being: for <hi>communicating doeth shewe, that all thing is common betweene it and Christes flesh: no diuision, no separation, no distinction commeth betweene these two, but a bar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> signe of bread can make no such communicating, because it is cleane of another kinde, &amp;c.</hi> That Sanders argument may be the stronger, he disputeth against that often times, which wee vtterly denie. For we neuer saide, that natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall bread or a bare signe, can make vs to haue commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with Christ, but the verie bodie &amp; bloud of Christ, yet not corporally but spiritually ioyned vnto vs, of which communicating, the bread and wine are effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall seales &amp; sacraments. As for Sanders assertion, of communicating to signifie all thing common betwene Christ and vs, not only without diuision, but euen with out distinction, is horrible heresie, and detestable blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemie. Saint Iohn, Ep. 1. Cap. 1. vseth the same worde often, saying, that wee haue <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> communicating with God the father, and his sonne Iesus Christ, haue wee then all thing common with God the father, so that ther is no distinction betweene vs and him? O intollerable blasphemie! The same Apostle saith, wee haue <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> communicating one w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> another, by which he not only sheweth, that the worde of communicating, signifieth not all that which Sander saith it doeth: but also tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth, that our communicating with Christ, and with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> members of Christ, is spirituall, whereof S. Paul spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth,

1. Cor. 10. We being manie, are one bodie, &amp;c. And last of all, that wee haue this <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> or communicating by other meanes then by receiuing the Sacrament. That wee haue seene and heard, saieth Saint Iohn, wee preach vnto you, that you also may haue communicating with vs, &amp; that our communicating may be with the father and with his sonne Iesus Christ. Againe, if we walke in the light, as he is light, we haue communicating one with another, and the bloud of Iesus Christ his sonne, doeth purge vs from all sinne.</p>
                  <p>The last wordes of conference, are bodie and bloud, for which he heapeth vp so many texts, as they are na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in, and more then either they are named &amp; meant in, to proue that bodie and bloud stand not for signe or figure of bodie and bloud, and in the ende concludeth, that because these wordes are taken properly, therefore, to defend the wordes of Christes supper to be figuratiue, is ignorance in Grammar and Logike, blindnesse in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinitie, malice inexcusable in the day of iudgement. But so long as it is but Sanders sophisticall conclusion, it is little to be regarded. what Logike, diuinitie, or consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence he hath that reasoneth thus, let all the Logicians, diuines, and men of good conscience consider, vntill Christ come and iudge all things. The worde bodie in this saying: This is my bodie, is not figuratiue, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the whole saying is not figuratiue. This, signifieth a generall thing, and not that thing in his hand: Is, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth that to be presently, which is not vntill all the wordes be said: bodie, is taken properly: Therefore the sense of this whole saying, vttered together, cannot be figuratiue. But nowe we shall see conference of other places of scripture. It is euident (he saith) that Iohn is not Elias, and vseth many arguments to proue it: yet will he admitte no arguments out of the present words, This is my bodie, to prooue that the saying is figuratiue, as well as, This is Elias. And yet there is more oddes betweene the bodie of Christ, and naturall bread, then (hee saith) is manifest betweene Iohn and Elias. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, The rocke was Christ, must needes be figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue,
<pb n="606" facs="tcp:13044:312"/>
because it speaketh of two diuerse natures: as though bread and y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> body of Christ were not two diuerse natures. <hi>But there is no conuersion of any rocke into Christ: for Christ did neither say of the rocke, This is my body, nor co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mand vs so to say.</hi> Seeing the holy ghost saieth, the rocke was Christ: who doubteth, but that it was so by the word of Christ, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though not expressed by Moses? And seing the Apostle speaketh so, in the time past, who will denie but that Moses or any man by the authority of Gods wordes, at such time as the Israelites did drinke of it, might haue said of the rocke: This is Christ?</p>

But Christ doth not only tell his Apostles, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they shal see him no more after his ascension, saying, I goe to my father, and you shal see mee no more, Iohn 16. ver. 10. but also he telleth them plainely, and without any parable, as they confesse, that he leaueth the world and goeth to his father. Io. 16. ver. 20. whereas if he had saied, I departe out of the worlde, when he onely departed out of sight, and purposed still to be present inuisibly, he had not spoken plainely, but very darkely. Whereas Chrysostom <hi>de sacerd. lib.</hi> 3. saith, <hi>it is a great miracle, that he which sitteth with his father in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, at the same instant is touched with the handes of all men, and deliuereth him selfe to those that will touch and embrace him.</hi> It is manifest, he speaketh of the heauenly mystery figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuely.

And so it is more wonderfull, that wee in body remaining on the earth, doe feede on Christ sitting in heauen, not by bringing him downe vnto vs, but by lifting vs vp vnto him. The places of scripture that Sander quoteth, as perteining to the sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, although they all pertaine not vnto it, yet when he can make any argument out of any of them for his carnall manner of presence, I shall easily answere it.</p>

                  <argument>
                     <p>Why the Sacrament is called breade <note place="margin">Sander.</note> after consecration</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>If Master Sander had first prooued, that the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <note place="margin">Fulk.</note> is not bread after consecration, wee might easily haue yelded to the reason that might be brought why it is called, that which in nature it is not. As wee can yeld many reasons, why the Sacrament is called the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Christ, although it be not the body of Christ in the nature of it: yet it is meete, that first wee prooue that it is not his body after that manner, that the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistes defend, and then shewe reasons why it is called by the name of that which it doth signifie. But let vs heare Sanders reasons.</p>
                  <p>First the Hebrue tongue, which the Euangelists &amp; A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles writing Greek, doth follow, vseth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> name bread for all maner of food. Secondly, a thing is called by the name of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which it was, and not which it is, as Aarons rod is said to haue deuoured the roddes of the coniurers,
<pb n="608" facs="tcp:13044:313"/>
yet was it turned from a rodde to a serpent. Exod. 7.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, a thing is called not onely as it is, but as it seemeth outwardly to be: so the Angell which the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man sawe at the sepulchre, is called a yong man. Marke 16. And in all these three respectes, the Sacrament is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led bread, when it is not naturall bread. For it is a kind of foode, it was bread, and seemeth to be breade. But I will prooue, that in none of these respectes, it is called bread, but because it is naturall bread in deede, without conuersion of the substance.</p>
                  <p>First, whatsoeuer is saide in Saint Iohn. Cap 6. is not particular to the Sacrament: for bread is there taken fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guratiuely for spirituall foode, which wee haue without the Sacrament.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, when S. Paul calleth the Sacrament bread, after consecration, there is no reason why the name of bread should not be taken for materiall bread, changed in vse, not in substance as the name of breade taken be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore consecration 1. Cor. 11. and where the Apostle saith the breade which wee breake, he sheweth plainlie, that he speaketh of material breade, for the bodie of Christe, nor spiritual foode, nor general foode are not broken. Secondly, in the conuersion of Aarons rodde, there was a sensible change, there is none such in the Sacrament. Thirdly, as the Angel had some appearance of a man in externall shape of bodie, so he had other manifest tokens in him that declared him to be an Angell, and no man: but the Sacramentall bread hath in it all tokens of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial bread, and no sensible token of the bodie of Christ, therefore the comparison is nothing like. The water turned into wine, was iudged by the taste to be wine &amp; not water. There can be no such iudgement in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentall bread: for as materiall bread it tasteth, and partaketh all accidents: yea, it nourisheth, and corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, which neither bare accidents, nor y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bodie of Christ doeth or can doe.</p>
                  <p>The authorities that Sander citeth, to proue, that the Sacramentall bread, is called the bodie and flesh of Christ, do not denie that it is material bread: yea, many
<pb n="609" facs="tcp:13044:313"/>
of the old writers, expressely affirme, that it is so. Yet let vs consider his authorities. Ignatius, Ep. 2. <hi>ad Rom.</hi> saith. <hi>Panem Dei volo, quod est caro Christi: I desire the bread of God, quod, which thing is the flesh of Christ.</hi> Verily, Ignatius saith no more here, then Zwinglius saide, which was no friend to transubstantiation. Secondly, Iustinus saith, <hi>Hic cibus, &amp;c.</hi> this meate is called with vs the Eucharist, or thanksgiuing: &amp; after he saith: <hi>We take not these things as common bread &amp; drink, but wee haue learned that the meate which is consecrated by the words of praier, taken of him, to be the flesh &amp; bloud of Christ.</hi> He that denieth the Sacrament to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon bread, doth not denie it to be naturall bread. And Iustinus interlaceth that which Sander omitteth, <q>
                        <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>. That meat, of which our bloud &amp; flesh, by transmutation are nourished, we haue learned to be the flesh &amp; bloud of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Iesus, that was incarnate.</q> That which nourisheth our flesh &amp; bloud, is material bread, although it be not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon bread. Thirdly, Hilarie saith: <hi>Nos verè &amp;c.</hi> we tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly take the word flesh, in our Lordes meate. The same Hilarie saith afterward: <hi>verè sub mysterio,</hi> truely, vnder 2 mysterie, we receiue the flesh of his bodie. Fourthly, Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian, <hi>lib. 2. Ep.</hi> 3. saith, <hi>Christ offered bread &amp; wine, that is to say, his owne bodie &amp; bloud.</hi> Here Sander cutteth off y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of Cyprians words, which manifestly proue ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial bread &amp; wine: <hi>Obtulit hoc idem quod Melchizedech ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulerat, id est, panem &amp; vinu, suum scilicet corpus &amp; sanguine<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>:</hi> He offered the selfe same thing that Melchizedek had offered, that is to say, bread &amp; wine, namely his bodie &amp; bloud. Speake Sander, &amp; tel vs, was it not material bread &amp; wine which Melchizedek brought forth? the selfsame thing, saith Cyprian, offered Christ, which yet was his bodie &amp; bloud, after a certeine maner. After what maner you may learne, <q> </q> In these wordes, you haue not onely the spirituall manner, after which the breade and wine are called his body and bloud, but also the same breade and wine, to be made of cornes &amp; grapes, which I trow ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be none other but material bread and wine. <hi>Fifthly, Irenaeus saith it is not now common bread, but the Eucharisty.</hi> lib. 4. C. 34. The same Irenaeus in the same place saith: that <hi>Eucharistia ex duabus rebus constant, terrena &amp; coelesti,</hi> the Sacrament consisteth of two things, an earthly thing, and an heauenly. Likewise he saith, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> of the bread &amp; wine, being made the Eucharisty, <hi>auge<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Sixtly, Ambrose <hi>de Sacr. lib.</hi> 5. calleth our daiely bread, supersubstantiall breade, and yet I weene, it be still naturall food of the body. But he saith more. <hi>Non iste panis est qui vadit in corpus: sed illa panis vitae aeternae qui animae nostrae substantiam fulcit:</hi> It is not the bread which goeth into the body, but that bread of euer lasting life, which holdeth vp the substance of our soule. I like this saying of Ambrose, or whosoeuer writ that booke, very well. The Sacrament is not that bread which goeth into the body, <hi>ergo</hi> the Sacrament is not the naturall body of Christ, which the Papistes affirme to be a kind of bread, that goeth into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> body. Seuenthly, Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory of Nyssa saieth, <hi>in vita Mosis, panis est, &amp;c. It is bread prouided for vs, without seede, without plowing, without any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther worke of man.</hi> But he saith immediatly before, that it is receiued with a pure and cleane mind, and is an hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly meate, therefore a spirituall food, spiritually to be receiued, and not bodily Eightly, S. Augustine Tra. 26. in Io<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Ninethly, Isychius <hi>in Leuit. li.</hi> 6. C. 22. na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth the bread which S. Paule saith, is eaten vnworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>nutritorem substantiae nostrae intelligibilis,</hi> the nourisher of
<pb n="611" facs="tcp:13044:314"/>
our spirituall substance. He meaneth, if it bee worthily receiued, otherwise it is damnation to him that eateth vnworthily. Lastly, Sedulius in Op. Pasc. saieth of the bread which Christ gaue to Iudas. <hi>Panem cui tradidit ipse, Qui panis tradendus erat. To whome he himselfe gaue bread, which bread was to be betrayed.</hi> A great miracle, if a Poet speake specially. But nowe directy against transub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiation, speake many doctors. Origen saith in Mat. Cap. 15. The sanctified meat, by that which it hath ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriall, goeth into the belly, and is cast foorth into the draught. Likewise, the matter of the bread profiteth not, &amp;c.

                  <p>Gelasius, a bishop of Rome, <hi>cont. Eutich.</hi> writeth of the bread and wine in the Sacrament: <hi>Et tamen esse non definit substantia &amp; natura panis &amp; vini.</hi> The substance and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the bread and wine ceasseth not to remaine.</p>
                  <p>These sayings with diuerse other, are direct against transubstantiation, and therefore lewdly doth Sander a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buse the readers with a number of places of the old wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, to proue it, of which, not one of them hath a reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable colour, when it is examined.</p>

And although Saint Paul had so saide, as hee reporteth, yet it followeth not, that he may drawe their figures whither he will.

For Caine is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to haue offered sacrifice as soone as Abel. Whereby it is probable, that neither of them both, was Priest, but Adam the heade of the familie, to whom they brought their seuerall oblations, vnto that place, which was called the presence of the Lorde, from whence Caine was bannished after his murther committed. Concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Abels virginitie, I will not contend, although if I should followe the Iewish traditions, as Sander doth in his allegoricall comparison in diuerse pointes, I must say, he was a married man, hauing to wife his sister Delbora. But to the comparison Sander saith, <hi>that A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell first offered himselfe vnder the shape of other things, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter went forth to be offered in his owne person, being traiterously slaine.</hi> This is nothing else, but a drousie dreame of Sanders sleep<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>e heade. The sacrifice of Abel was a figure of the sacrifice of Christes death, and not of his last sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. Neither did he offer himselfe, vnder the shape of his satte lambes, but he offered his lambes in signe, that God by the mediation of Christs death, should accept him. Neither did Abel go forth of purpose to be offered in his own person, when he was murthered, as Christe did, neither was the death of Abel a sacrifice, whose bloud cried vengeance, whereas the bloud of Christs sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
<pb n="613" facs="tcp:13044:315"/>
crieth mercie Heb. 11. Wherefore this is nothing else but a grosse abusing of the Scriptures, to faigne such foolish figures which haue no grounde in the worde of God, but are such as euerie one will inuent out of his own imagination. Euen as y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> iest of Sander, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Caine did beare a figure of the English communion, in which no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but a few bsse fruits of the earth are offered: when much rather, I might say, that Cain did beare a figure of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> murdering church of Rome, which hath slain so many Abels, because her sacrifice of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fruits of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> erth, is no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter accepted. But what should I trifle after so vaine a ma ner? The second figure is of Melchizedek, which in deed seemed plausible to many of the old fathers. Against all which, I oppose the credit of the Apostle to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Hebrewes, who omitting nothing that in Melchizedeks priesthood might be referred to Christ, maketh no mention of the sacrifice of bread and wine, which Melchizedek brought forth of princely liberalitie, &amp; not of priestly dutie. And yet it is a vaine thing for the Papists to brag of Melchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zedeks bread &amp; wine, when they in their sacrifice wil ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg to remain, neither bread nor wine. But of al y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> euer I heard, it is a most impudent comparison, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Sander maketh of Melchizedek consecrating Abraha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of him, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> was really present, as it were in his ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds: And Christ consecrating his owne bodie &amp; bloud pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent in his hands at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> time of his blessing &amp; consecrating, and tanteth the Sacramentaries for acknowledging the one &amp; denying the other. Although he speake contrary to poperie, which teacheth the presence to be after con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secration, and not at the time of consecrating. But what bridle may hold in the shameles furie of Sander?</p>
                  <p>The third figure is of the paschall lambe, which was a figure of Christs death, and so applied by S. Iohn in that saying, you shal not break a bone of him. Ioan. 19. &amp; S. Paul. 1. Cor. 5. &amp; not a figure of the supper, from which as it differeth in signe, so it is all one in the thing signified. The fourth is the prophesie and figure of Manna, which as the Apostle teacheth 1. Cor. 10 was the same spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all meate, that we eate, &amp; not a figure thereof, but a sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament
<pb n="614" facs="tcp:13044:316"/>
of our spirituall feeding by the flesh of Christ, like as the water of the rocke, which was Christ, was a Sacrament of our spiritual nourishment by the bloud of Christ. Wherefore the partes of this comparison, as they haue ben all answered before in the third book, so they are of no force to prooue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> real presence or transubstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation, but the contrary, seing the differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of these two Sacramentes, Manna and the Lordes bread, is only in the signes, &amp; nothing at all in the vertue of the things signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, according to S. Aug. rule. The fist figure is of the bloud of the old Testament, wherunto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bloud of Christ shedde on the crosse doth answere, as the Apostle mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festly teacheth Heb. 9. therefore these wordes of the sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per: This is the bloud of the new Testament, of neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity must be figuratiue, euen as these which are of the same sense: This cuppe is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> new Testament in my bloud. For we may not so farre aduance the Sacrament, that we abase the death of Christ, which is the only Sacrifice for our sinnes. The sixt is the prophecy and figure of Iob, which is a manifest peruerting of the scripture, from the true meaning: for either Iob complaineth of the cruelty of his seruantes, that would euen eate his flesh in his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersity; and speaketh not of the loue that his seruantes had to be ioyned vnto his flesh, as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> context of that place Iob. 31. doth euidently shew; or els he sheweth the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint of his seruantes, that were so occupied in hospi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality, that they had no leasure to eate their meat, and therefore desired to eate the meare that was prouided for the stranger. Or if with Chrysost. we should vnderstand their desire to be of eating of Iobs flesh, yet it perreineth not to transubstantiation, seing we may eate the flesh of Christ without eating of the Sacrament. The seuenth conference is of prophecies taken out of Dauid and Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, whereas neither of both speaketh of the Sacrament, Dauid saith, Psa. 22. Thou hast prepared a table in my sight<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> against them who afflict me.

vnto him. The saying of Salomon, Pro. 9. I haue an swered in the beginning of this work, where it was pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by Sander. The 8. conference, is another Prophecie of Dauid, where he saith, all that be fat vpon earth, haue eaten &amp; adored. Sander saith, they haue adored y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which they do eat, but Dauid saith not so, Ps. 21. but that they shal worship God y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> author of their food, as it followeth immediatly: They shall all fall down &amp;c. And whereas Sander quoteth Aug. in Ps. 98. to iustifie the adoratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the blessed Sacrament of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> altar, the footstoole, wherin the fulnes of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> godhead corporally dwelleth: you shall vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Augustine vtterly denieth the Lords supper to be y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> bodie y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> was crucified, but a Sacrament, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing spiritually vnderstood, shall quicken vs. The last conference is of many prophecies &amp; figures, ioyned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, as he saith, for breuities sake. The first is of Noe being naked, after he was drunk, &amp; laughed to scorne of his sonne. So saith Sander was Christ after he had drunke his owne bloud in his supper, which he planted for him selfe in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> virgins wombe, hanged, naked, &amp; laughed to scorne, not only of the Iewes, but also of the Sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries, for so grosse a deede, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he drank his owne bloud, vnder y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> form of wine. What shal I say to this monstrous blasphemie, wherein he compareth y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> filthie drunkennes, &amp; shameles nakednes of Noe, to the holy mysterie and passion of Christ? After this he ioyneth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cakes, that A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham set before y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Angels, as figures of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> mystical cake which was to come in Christs supper: but whereof then were y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> butter, milk, &amp; calues flesh, figures? O madnesse more then folly: for now wheresoeuer bread, corn, wine, vines, fruits of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> earth were named, all were figures of the sacrament, wherin yet he saith, is neither bread nor wine nor substance of any earthly fruit. Isaac blessed Iacob w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> corne &amp; wine, saying to Esau, what ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I do more to thee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And the dissembling of Dauid, before Achis, which came of infidelity, is blasphemous to apply to our Sauiour Christe, and especially with such termes, as Sander vseth, <hi>At his last supper he driuel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The meaning of Augustine is, when he caried the Sacrament of his body.

Likewise the bread that strengtheneth, and the wine that comforteth the hart of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> spiritual man, Ps. 103. the meat that God giueth to them that feare him: these (if wee beleeue Sander) were prophecies of the Sacrament, in which is neither bread nor wine. But of all other, mee

thinke Sander should haue held his peace, of the <hi>Goodly chalice that maketh Christians drunke,</hi> Ps. 22. seing he wil not suffer Christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, so much as to quench their thirst of that chalice, much lesse to be made drunk with it. Peraduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture it is, because the Papistes will keepe true Christians sober, that they will not suffer them to drinke of that goodly chalice that maketh men drunk. O shameles hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites! My soule yrketh to rehearse these grosse moc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keries of Gods worde. Elias is fedde from the ayer with breade and flesh, and walketh 40. dayes in the inwarde <note place="margin">3. Reg. 17. 3. Reg. 19.</note> strength of a peece of bread. Yet in the first there was bread and flesh, which would make well for the Luthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rans; in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other, there was bread and water, which would serue the turne of the Aquarians, if these places were fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures of the Sacrament. The wheaten corne Es. 62. which Hieronyme interpreteth to be the corne of the Church, shall no more be giuen to her enimies, &amp; that vine wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in she hath labored, shall no more be drunke of strange children, the corne of the elect and the wine that ingen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth virgins, as the vulgar text translateth, Zachary Cap. 9. If they perteine to the Sacrament, doe rather fight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst transubstantiation then for it. As for the bread in Ieremie 11. wherein the wodde is fastened, is a palpable error of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> translator, as I haue shewed before. The cleane Sacrifice of Malachie is to be offered of euery one of the faithfull, and therefore is not the Popish Sacrifice of the Masse. The bread of Angels was Manna, Psa. 77. which spiritually was y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> body of Christ, as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Sacramental bread is to vs. Last of all Salomon saith and repeteth often: No other thing to be good vnder the sunne, besides eating &amp; drinking with gladnes and mirth, where vnto Sander ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> best thing vnder the sunne, may be eaten and drunken, which Salomon neither said nor meant, but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> amongst the troubles and vanities of the world, nothing was better for a man, then quietly to enioy those things, which God giueth, and to lead his life peaceably &amp; iust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.

Finally where Sander concludeth, that the custom of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> scripture, in commending so much bread and wine, sheweth y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the body &amp; bloud of Christ should

                  <p>As for the saying of Dauid, <hi>memoriam fecit, &amp;c.</hi> He hath made a remembrance, is to no purpose, for although he spake of the sacrament as he doth not, yet there is great difference betweene making the bodie of Christ, and making a remembrance of his meruailous workes.

                  <p>Out of Chrysostome are cited diuerse places, al which are rather against Sanders making, then for it, as these: The priestes make the oblation, which Christ gaue to his disciples. <hi>in 2.

Againe, <hi>Non homo est qui corpus, &amp;c.</hi> It is not a man which maketh the bodie and bloude of Christ, but the same Christ, which was crucified for vs &amp;c. Yet Sander saith, Christ saying. <hi>Hoc facite,</hi> commaunded men to make his bodie. <hi>Aug. Cont. Faust, Manich. lib. 20. cap.</hi> 3. saith <hi>that our breade &amp; chalice is made mysticall vnto vs, not borne, made I say: Therefore hoc facite signifieth make this thing.</hi> I deny the argument, especially vnderstanding this thing for the naturall bodie of Christ.

                  <p>To the obiection that the remembrance of a man, dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth <note place="margin">Fulke.</note> from the man himself: Sander answereth, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Christ said not onely, do this, but also, make this thing, because <hi>facere</hi> signifieth both to doe and to make: and the reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of Christ is the shewing of his death, as S. Paul teacheth by facte and by making Christs bodie vnder di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerse kinds, to shew y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> separation of the bodie from the soule, the breaking and eating of it in signe, sheweth the breaking of it on y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> crosse &amp;c. To this I reply, that <hi>facere</hi> can haue but one signification at one time, and seeing <hi>fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere in commemorationem</hi> is expounded by S. Paul (as Sand, also confesseth) to shew the Lords death, which is by do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing &amp; not by making, except you meane, the making of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sacrament, <hi>hoc facite</hi> is still do this thing. In deede, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie ministratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the sacrament according to Christs in stitutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is a preaching of the Lords death: but it follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not therof, that the Lord is present, whom y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Apostle, by implication saith to be absent: for he addeth, vntill he come, which were not properly saide, if in person he were present, but rather vntill he be seene, which is there pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent inuisible. To come, is to remoue, from one place to another place, where y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> remouer was not before he came. But Sander saith, the presence of the benefactor, is the best meane to make his good deede remembred, as the scarre in a mans face being seene, is the best remembra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of his fighting for his friends defence. I haue often shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the vanitie of this kinde of reasoning, by which it shoulde followe that Christ left vs not the best token of remembrance of his death, because he is not seene, with the print of his wounds. But we must esteeme, the best remembrance, according to his wisedome, that hath
<pb n="623" facs="tcp:13044:320"/>
ordained it, who in all respects no doubt, hath appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                     </gap>ed the best that might be for confirmation of our saith. Yet in Sanders example, or any that hee can deuise, a remembrance will alwayes differ from the thing reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred, as the scarie and the fighting, are not all one: so the remembrance of Christ crucified, and Christ crucifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himselfe, are not all one. Neither must Sander baffu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> vs, with the remembrance of an action onely, for wee are to remember the person with his benifites, in or for the remembrance of me, saith Christ, vntill he come, saith Paul. That a thing may be present, which is not seene, as to a blinde man, Sander needed not to proue, but that a thing may be both absent, and present, in the same substance, visibly or inuisibly, that is the matter, which would require Sander to shewe his witte, in gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing vs either a reason or an experience. But the reall presence of Christ, saith he, causeth the people to come with due preparation and mortification, which as Basil affirmeth, is a peece of the remembrance, whereas in ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and drinking breade and wine, Christe is so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred, that sinnes be neither confessed, nor amende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment minded, nor faith exercised, nor charitie vsed, as nowe a daies in England it is handled, by meanes of the newe preachers. What fruitfull remembrance of Christes death, the popish doctrine doth worke, wee lament to see the remanents, yet in diuerse places, where the people are not taught, that spend their time as they were wont to doe in poperie, when they had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued their maker, as they were taught to speake. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariwise, where true doctrine and good discipline haue preuailed, enuie her selfe may see examples sufficient, to confute the shamelesse slaunders of Sander. As for the glorious monument of the Masse, which Sander describeth to shewe what remembrance of Christ is made therein: he doeth well to compare it to a sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chre, which hath outwardly goodly painting &amp; carning, but inwardly is ful of rotten bones &amp; corruptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. As good a shewing as y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> and better too, may be made vpon a stage
<pb n="624" facs="tcp:13044:321"/>
with puppets. For what doctrine is there in the masse for the comfort of an afflicted conscience, but dumbe shewes and idle ceremonies<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in exposition whereof the popish doctors themselues cannot agree, in which if there were any profitable doctrine, it were hidde from the people, as it were with the grauestone of an vnknowen tongue. But that which of all other is worst, what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of Christes death and sacrifice call you that, which sacrilegiously challengeth vnto it selfe that which is singular and proper to the death of Christ? But Sander hauing once entred into the allegorie of a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchre, cannot so lightlie leaue it, but teacheth, that Christ hauing ordained the sacrament for a sepulchre, woulde not make it an hearse or sepulchre without his bodie lying therein. To this I answere, that sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chres are to laye in deade carcases, but Christ is risen from death, and ascended into heauen, hauing left his sacraments as monuments of him that was deade, but nowe liueth eternally, not as graues wherein his deade bodie still shoulde remaine. But Chrysostome is char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to call Christes bodie <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> a carcase, because it is present, after the same rate, as it was deade in the sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chre, not without life, but without sensible mouing as Epiphanius hath noted.</p>
                  <p>I answere, hee doth impudently charge Chrysostome to render that reason, why hee calleth Christes bodie a carcase, <hi>in 1. Corint. Homil.</hi> 24. because hee is present without sensible moouing. For there is no such thing in that homily, although there bee some excessiue and hyperbolicall speaches, as that Christ suffereth to bee broken in the Sacrament, which was not broken on the crosse. And euen as false it is that hee affirmeth of Epiphanius, for hee saith not that Christ is without sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible moouing.

Shall we then skippe ouer the authors wordes, which calleth this newe sacrifice, whereof he speaketh so much <hi>sacrificium panis &amp; vini,</hi> the sacrifice of breade and wine? Therefore when he saith, In this sacrifice: I aske, what sacrifice he telleth me, in the sacrifice of bread and wine, is euidently shewed, what is alreadie giuen vs? You see Fulgentius meaneth euident shewing, otherwise then Sander doth, which thinketh it cannot be by breade and wine. And as to Sanders reason, that flesh sheweth flesh, more euidently then breade: I answere that Fulgentius compareth not so much the euidence of the signes, as the difference of the times, which then was to come, nowe is past, concerning the passion of Christ. Although that which is shewed to be perfourmed already, is more euidentlie shewed, then that which is darkely promised to be perfourmed hereafter. And the doctrine of the Gospell in preaching Christes death, is a more cleere and euident demonstration of his benefites, then the doctrine of the sacrifices was.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="628" facs="tcp:13044:323"/>
But Sander compareth the flesh of the olde sacrifices, and the breade of the Lordes supper, as though it were none otherwise shewed to bee the remembrance of Christes death in the Church of Christ, then it is in their popish masse: whereas Fulgentius speaketh not of the bare ceremonie of the Sacrament, but of the Sacrament with the doctrine there vnto belonging, which is tence times a more euident shewing of Christes death then the olde sacrifices were. Otherwise he might say, that circumcision was a more euident shewing of mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and regeneration, then baptisme, because that which was done in the member, naturally made for ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, did more euidently shewe those mysteries, then dipping or sprinkling of water. But as their cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies were more sensible demonstrations, so the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of our sacraments, is wonderfully more cleere and euident.</p>
                  <p>Finally, seeing this writer, entendeth to teach Peter the Deacon most plainely: why doth he call the sacrame<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> the sacrifice of breade and wine, if there be no breade and wine in that holy office or seruice? for so hee taketh the worde Sacrifice, and not properly, as his whole ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position doeth shewe. For if he had meant a popish re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all presence, why doth hee not once name any thing sounding there to? if hee had meant a propitiatorie sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, why doth he so manifestly distinguish it from the sacrifice of Christ, and place it onely in thankesgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing and remembrance of Christ crucified? Verily this place, whether it was written by Augustine or Fulgenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us, it is vtter enimie to transubstantiation, and the propi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiatorie sacrifice of the popish masse. But what neede I bring the fathers, one by one, saith Sander, sith the whole seconde Councell of Nice, doubted not to say<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> A worshipfull Councell, of vnlearned Idolaters: And what say they? <q>
                        <hi>Nemo sanctorum &amp;c.</hi> None of the holy Apostles, which are the trumpet of the holy Ghost, either of our glorious fathers, hath said our vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bloudy sacrifice, which is made in the remembrance of Christ our Lord and God, his passion and of his whole
<pb n="629" facs="tcp:13044:323"/>
conuersation, to be an image of that bodie.</q> If this Councell say true, that none of the Apostles haue so said, then Sander is condemned by this Councell, for falsifying the Scripture. Heb. 10. when vnder colour of the Apostles wordes, he affirmeth the sacrament not to be a shadowe of thinges to come, but to be the image of the thing it selfe. Lib. 3. Cap. 10. But that all these fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers do lie, when they say none of our fathers, haue said the sacrifice to be an image of his bodie, it might be proued by diuerse ancient witnesses: among which I will name Ambrose, <hi>Offici. lib. 1. ca.</hi> 1. who speaking of the sacrament, which he calleth the sacrifice, wherein Christ is offered, saieth, <hi>Hîc in imagine, ibi in veritate,</hi> heere in an image, there hee is offered in trueth, where as an aduo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate hee maketh intercession with the father for vs. In this saying, what is the image, but the sacrament? and whereof is it an Image? of his bodie: where the image is also perfectly distinguished from the truth.

                  <p>Finally to the authoritie of this seconde Nicen coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, I oppose the Ephesine Councell, which determined against images, and affirmed the Sacrament of the bodie and bloude of Christ to be the onely image of his passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that is left for Christian men to imbrace.</p>
                  <p>The last Chapter of this booke, being entituled by name against that reuerende father Master Nowels challenge, is so plentifully, and substantially confuted by himselfe, against whom it was written, that I neede not once to meddle with it.

Our Lorde Iesus himselfe crieth out, This is my body; before the blessing of the heauenly words it is called one kinde, after consecration, the body of Christ is signified. He himselfe calleth it his bloud, before consecration it is called another thing, after consecration it is called bloud.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>But now<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> concerning the worde of communicating, Sander saith that it <hi>sheweth both the effect wrought by blessing, which is the presence of the bloud of Christ, and the finall cause why it is made, verily to communicate vnto vs the merites of Christes death, where the said bloud was shedde for the remission of sinnes. If the chalis after blessing; had no bloud in it: how did it communicate to vs the bloud of Christ?</hi> This is Sanders deepe diuinity. As though the bloud of Christ, is not commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated to vs in baptisme, for the remission of sinnes, by the merites of Christes death, where yet the bloude of Christ is not really present. But seing the Apostle saith, that the cuppe of blessing which wee blesse, is the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating of the bloud of Christ, it followeth that the wicked, which haue no fellowship with Christ, receiue nor the bloud of Christ in the cuppe, and consequently, that the bloud of Christ is not really present. Yet Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostome giuing the literall sense, (saith Sander) of those wordes, writeth thus, <hi>Eorum autem huiusmodi est sententia, quod est in calice, id est quod a latere fluxit, &amp; illius sumus par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                        </gap>.</hi> Of these wordes this is the meaning: The same which is in the chalice, is that which flowed from the side, and thereof we are partakers. I answere, Chrysostom doth so giue the literal sense, that he meaneth the bloud of Christ to be no otherwise then sacramentally in the chalice: for in the same Hom. 24. in 1. Cor. 10. he affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Christ suffereth himselfe to be broken in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, which he suffered not on the crosse: That wee are the selfesame body, that we receiue. Finally, to shew where we are partakers of Christes body, he saieth that by this Sacrament, we are made eagles, and flye vp to heauen, or rather aboue heauen, for where the dead bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy is, thither will the eagles be gathered.</p>

                  <p>In handling the word of communicating, he bringeth in a distinction of <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>: For we all are partakers of one bread. Now concerning the matter of communicating of Christ, Sander saith, it can not be by a bare signe and token. And wee say euen the same, but by a Sacrament, wherein Christes body and bloud is not really present, it may be. For els how are they that are baptised only, made members of Christ, and haue a true communicating of his body and bloud? yea, how had all the fathers before Christes incarnation, this communicating of Christes body and bloud? with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which they were no members of Christ, the like I say of raysing of our bodies, not by a figure of Christes body, but by the vertue of his body it selfe, which vertue if it could not be communicated to our bodies, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise then by reall presence in the Sacrament, as Sander falsly dreameth, that Irenaeus shoulde meane, by what meanes should the resurrection of all them be wrought
<pb n="634" facs="tcp:13044:326"/>
which haue not receiued the Sacrament? O shameles, and yet most blockheaded kinde of reasoning! As for Irenae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us, hee prooueth the resurrection of our bodies against the heretiks, by that they are fed with the body &amp; bloud of Christ, in the Sacrament, by their owne confession. But he doth not hold it necessary, that who so euer i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

For we haue communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation with God the father &amp; with Iesus Christ by faith, as S. Ioan teacheth, 1. Ioh. 1. in the Gospell preached and receiued.

Cyprian saith, bread and wine made of graines and grapes, and not the forme of bread, which was made of graines, &amp; is now no bread, as (Sander saith) doth represent this vnion.

But that is false: for in the first and last place, breade is put for the earthly matter of the mysterie, or sacrament. Against this Sander re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyeth, and saith: that if we once take the substance of common bread, to be the thing which is broken, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is that substance the communicating of Christes bodie, nor wee are all one materiall breade.</p>

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>r riseth vp and saith, that if to bee, is interpreted to signifie, then in the next verse, where it is saide, we that are manie, are one bread, and one bodie, we are said to be the figure of one bread, because it is one verbe and one nowne in both places. A simple cause, as though one verbe and one nowne in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerse places may not be diuersly taken. And yet we can not be called one bread, but figuratiuely, that is like vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to one loafe of bread, made one of many graines, &amp; one bodie, that is like vnto one bodie, consisting of diuerse members spiritually vnited together. But Sander vrgeth vs further by the wordes of breaking and partaking: if the bread broken be materiall bread (saith he) wee par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of the materiall bread, and yet the bread whereof we partake, is by Saint Paul named one, for seeing it is broken, it is not still one. I answere: wee partake all of one materiall breade, which is either one in lumpe, or kinde, to signifie, that wee doe spiritually communicate with the onely bodie of Christ by faith. As for Sanders cauill, that the bread is not one still, seeing it is broken, is an impudent Sophisme. For neither can Christ at one time, and in one respect be called whole and broken. Do not they all eate of one sheepe, which eate of it after it is deuided in partes? The lawe commanded one sheep for euery houshold, which was the same Sacrament in spirituall signification and effect, that the one bread and cup is vnto vs. So we all eate of one material bread, and are spiritually made one mysticall bread and bodie, not so many a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

it worthily by faith. Wherefore the vertue of coniunctio is not in that which is eaten with the mouth, as Sander would haue it seeme, but in the mightie working of the spirite of God, who not onely in this Sacrament, but in all Sacraments of all times, haue wrought the same spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall vnion, in all the faithful of all ages, who al make one Church and one bodie, whereof Christ is the head, and euery one of the elect is a member.</p>

                        <hi>Nulli est all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quatenus, &amp;c.</hi> No man ought by any meanes to doubt, but that he is then made partaker of the body and bloud of our Lorde: when he is made a member of Christ in baptisme, neither is he alienated from the company of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> bread and that cuppe, although before he eate y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bread &amp; drinke that cuppe (being placed in the vnity of Christes body) he depart out of this world. For he is not depriued of the partaking and benifite of that Sacrament: for so much as himselfe hath found that thing, which the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament doth signifie, whereas Christ said, except ye eate my flesh and drinke my bloud, ye shall not haue life in you.</q> Out of this place, although it be directly against transubstantiation, yet Sander is able to prooue it. <hi>If the body of Christ</hi> (saith he) <hi>were not really vnder the forme of bread, how could he that is baptised, be partaker of the benifit of this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t? was he made partaker of bread and wine?</hi> No forsooth, but he is made in baptisme partaker of the bodie and bloud of Christ, which is signified by that bread and cuppe. So saith Augustine, or who so euer was author of that sermon, and therefore the bodie of Christ is none otherwise present, in the supper then in baptisme.</p>
                  <p>But take away that bodie of Christ (saith Sander) from the forme of breade, and there is no signe of vnitie in Christ: for euery loafe betokeneth vnitie, but not in Christ. Againe, let the substance of breade remaine, and signifie the mysticall bodie of Christ, which is absent, the vnion of Christ and his members is signified to be as farre asunder, as heauen is distant from earth. I answere, this is poore Sophistry, yet much vsed by Sander, disioyning thinges y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ought to be ioyned togither: beside y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> this wise reason would proue likewise,

Howe be it wee teach the presence of Christ in his mysteries, such presence I say, as is meete for his glorious maiestie, namely by his spirite, which ioyneth heauen and earth together, and maketh our vnitie to be perfect, although in nature and place wee bee neuer so farre distant. And such presence of Christ in his sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments wee acknowledge, as may stande with the truth of his naturall bodie, which if hee haue not like vnto ours in all thinges, except sinne, and such infirmitie as our bodie is subiect vnto through sinne, in vaine, should wee looke for the redemption of our bodies by him, and the conformation of them vnto his glorious bodie.</p>
                  <p>The vnitie that saint Hilarie spake of, wee allowe. <q>lib. 8. <hi>de Trinit.</hi> If Christ assumpted truely the flesh of our bodie, and wee take truelie vnder a mysterie, the flesh of his bodie, and by this wee shall bee one, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the father is in him, and hee in vs: howe is the v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie of will affirmed, when the naturall propertie by the which Sacrament is a Sacrament of a perfect vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie?</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>In this saying, Hilarie reprooueth the Arrians, which affirmed that the vnitie of Christ with his father, was not an vnitie of nature and substance, but of will only. But seeing the vnitie that wee haue with Christ, which is prooued by his taking of our flesh truely, and by giuing his flesh truelie vnto vs vnder a mysterie in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, to bee an vnitie in substance, and not in will onely, it is absurd to say, that the vnity of Christ and his father should bee one lie in will. Now let vs see, what poyson the Spider sucketh out of this wholsome flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.</p>
                  <p>First he noteth, that we truely take the flesh of Christ: I graunt vnder a mysterie, as Hilarie saith, so many as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t worthily, for els wicked men should be

vnited to Christ, as he is to his father. Secondly, the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterie with Sander, must be the forme of bread, but that I denie, for the forme of bread is no secrete, but a visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and naturall thing. Wherefore, the mysterie vnder which, we truely take the flesh of Christ, must be that secrete and wonderfull manner, by which Christ doeth communicate his flesh vnto vs. Thirdly, he sayeth, that worde Proprietie, doeth signifie a person, because Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine saith, Christ is a vine by similitude, <hi>non per proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Sander doeth openly and violently falsifie Hilarie, where he saith, <hi>the naturall proprietie of Christ by a Sacrament is a sacrament,</hi> interpreting property for person.

First, he would prooue, that the Christians haue a sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, <note place="margin">Fulke.</note> because Saint Paul vseth the examples of the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices of the Iewes and Gentiles: but he seeth not the analogie. S.

Nowe the Lordes supper, is the feast of the onely sacrifice of Christ, once offered by him, which maketh vs to communicate with his sacrifice, if we receiue it worthily, as the feasts of the Iewish and idolatrous sacrifices, made the partakers co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate with their sacrifices, &amp; them to whom thei are offered. And whereas the Apostle saith, we haue an altar wherof they haue no power to eat, that serue in the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle: he meaneth y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the ceremoniall Iewes, can haue no participation of the sacrifice of Christ, except they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce their Iewish obseruations. Or if you wil vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand it of such sacrifices of praise, as the Apostle within fewe lines after speaketh; or of the Lords supper, which is a remembrance of Christs onely sacrifice, as some haue done, the cause of the real presence is neuer awhit hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen. Yes (saith Sander) <hi>This then being the meat of our altar, it followeth, that this meat is no lesse present vpon his holy table: then that which the Iewes or Idolaters did eate, was present a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Therfore, likewise Christes fleshe is really present, and receiued into our mouthes.</hi> I denie the <hi>mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor</hi> or assumption of this syllogisme. For the diuels, wherof the Gentiles did partake, were not really present in the meate which they did eate, nor receiued into their mouthes. The like I say of the altar of the Iewes, wherof they were partakers which did eat of the sacrifice. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this argument may be rightly turned backe vppon Sanders neck. The diuels and the altar, whereof the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles and Iewes were partakers, were not really present in the meate, nor receiued into their mouthes: therefore the flesh of Christ, whereof the Christrians are partakers, is not really present in the bread, nor receiued into their mouthes.</p>

                     </gap>hat time wherein he deliuered his bodie to his disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples: which is all one, as if he said, that Christ died more then once, directly contrary to the scripture. Heb. 9. But seeing in the determination of God, and in respect of the effect of his death, he was the lambe slaine from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the worlde, the institution of the Sacrament shewed his death before he died, as wel as after. But how the bloud of Christ was really separated from his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, before his passion, otherwise then in a Sacrament, or mysterie, let Sander tell, if he can. And where he saith, a figure eaten, can shewe but a figuratiue death past, it is vtterly false: for the figures of the lawe, shewed not a fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guratiue, but a reall death to come. And doeth not baptisme, where is no reall presence, shewe the Lordes death, buriall, and resurrection truely past? But Sander will helpe the matter, by false pointing a place of Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brose in 1. Cor. 11. <hi>Quia enim morte Domini liberati sumus: huius rei memores in edendo &amp; potando, carnem &amp; sanguinem quae pro nobis oblata sunt significamus:</hi> Because we are deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered by the death of our Lorde, being mindfull of this thing in eating and drinking, wee signifie the fleshe and bloud which were offered for vs. Which Sander thus en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glisheth: Because we are made free, through the death of our Lorde being mindfull thereof, wee in eating &amp; drinking flesh and bloud, shewe the things that were of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to death for vs.</p>

                     <pb n="646" facs="tcp:13044:332"/>
The example he bringeth out of Damascen, of them that defended the carying of dead mens bones, because they put them in remembrance of death, is friuolous, &amp; maketh nothing to the purpose: for I will demaunde of Sander that vrgeth so egerly the real presence for shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Christes death: is the bodie of Christ in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament dead or aliue? if it be aliue, as I am sure he wil say, what similitude hath it with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> dead bones, and howe doeth it shewe his death which is eaten aliue, except it be in the dead figures of bread and wine, which haue no life? If the death be represented only in outward shewes, seing the bodie that is receiued is aliue, what is become of Sanders diuinitie and Logike, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the figures or shewes of a dead bodie cannot shewe but a figuratiue and ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined death. As for the argument, <hi>a consequentibus,</hi> holdeth aswell of the Sacrament, as of the matter therof, ye eate the Sacrament of Christ crucified, <hi>ergo</hi> Christ is crucified. But Sander would separate all doctrine from the Sacrament, and knowe howe we should shew him to haue died, by onely eating it. I aunswere, by onely ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of a liuing bodie, we could not knowe that he had died: therefore doctrine of necessitie must be ioyned with the outward action.</p>
                  <p>And further, where he would knowe, whether Christ did institute this Sacrament, to shewe his death past in deede, or past<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

                     </gap> a bare shadowe: I answere, he instituted it before his death, and therefore not so much to shewe the historie of his death to come or past, as to shewe the vertue of his death, by which his bodie was broken, and his bloud shed, that it might be meate and drinke vnto vs. And when the Apostle saith, wee shewe the Lordes death, he meaneth not onely the bare storie thereof, but the fruit and effect thereof: wherefore Sander playeth the foole egregiously, to bable so much of Christs death past in deede, or in shadowes to come: For the olde Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, did not only prophecie of an action to bee done, but also did confirme the faith of the godly, in the fruits &amp; effects of the passio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Christ. Finally, Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostome in 1. Cor. 24. speaketh figuratiuely, where he
<pb n="647" facs="tcp:13044:332"/>
saith, when thou feest this bodie set before thee, say with thy selfe: This bodie nailed and beaten, was not ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of death. This bodie, the sunne seeing crucified, turned away his beames, &amp;c. but he expoundeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe sufficiently in the same Homily, where he saith, we must be Eagles, &amp; flie into heauen, where the bodie of Christ that died for vs, remaineth. In the same sense, that it is called the bodie of Christ, he applyeth to the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment such things as were proper to the bodie of Christ. But as for transubstantiation, which the Papists woulde gather out of this place, in many places he sheweth, that he acknowledgeth not, and <hi>ad Caesarium monachum,</hi> he doth expressely denie it.</p>

This Grammaticall Logike, is meete for Papisticall di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinity. I thinke there was neuer man, that set his penne to the paper, that wrot more impudently. What say you, Master doctor Sander? Doth the Pronowne This, alway shewe a thing present to some sense or other? To what sense is the body of Christ present, in that thing, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of it is saide: This is my body? And doth the absence of Saint Paule hinder him to speake of breade in saying, This bread; and further him to speake of Christes natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall body, in saying, this is my body. This learning, Master Sander, passeth my vnderstanding. What saied I, this learning? I knowe not how to speake, seing the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowne This, doth shew a thing present to some sense, or other, but the learning, shewed in this. Tush, I must say in such kind of reasoning, is an higher matter, then can be conceiued by any sense, witt, reason, or vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding. Neither is his sharpnes lesse in answering obiecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, then in making of argumentes. <hi>For if you obiect, that Christ meant the signe of his body: he answereth, that seing Saint Paule named no signe, as (This) can not point to that which was not named, so it must point onely to the thing named before, which was the body of Christ broken for vs, therefore this bread, mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth that body of Christ and none other substance.</hi> I blame not Master Sander, if he will not haue.

                     <p>The reall presence is prooued, because vnworthy receiuers are <note place="margin">Sander.</note> guilty of Christes body and bloud.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>A man is guilty (saith Sander) either for doing an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill <note place="margin">Fulke.</note> deede, or leauing a good deede vndone: or doing a good deede after an euill manner, and after the last man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner is he guilty, that receiueth vnworthily. I will not deale with his diuision, nor inquire whether euery one that receiueth vnworthily, doth a good deede after an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill manner. But to the purpose of the reall presence: his deede (saith Sander) <hi>is eating, which thing he so really doth, that S. Paule affirmeth him to eate and drinke damnation to him selfe.</hi> Why so, Sander? is that which he eateth and drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth really damnation? if it be, then surely he eateth nor drinketh really the body and bloud of Christ, which are in an other predicament then damnation. But if to eate and drinke damnation, be spoken figuratiuely, where the sense is by eating to deserue damnation, why may not eating and drinking of the bodie and bloud of Christ, be spoken figuratiuely, where the sense is by eating and drinking, to be assured of saluation, wrought by the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and bloud of Christ? But no man is guilty (saith San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der) for doing more then he actually doth: therefore the vnworthye receiuer actually doth eate the bodye and bloud of Christ, whereof he is guilty. I deny the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which is a balde petition of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> principle, for the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthye receiuer is guilty of the bodye and bloud of Christ, not for eating and drinking it, but for eatig this bread vnworthily, &amp; so contemning the body of Christ, or not discerning the Lordes body, as the Apostle saith. The antecedent is also false: for a man is guilty especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in the sight of God, for his euill mind, purpose, affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, which often are more then actually he doth. As in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> similitude of abusing the Princes seale, which I vsed in the Chapter last before. But Sander exclaimeth against the <hi>shamelesse interpretation of heretikes, which imagine that S.

Although we say, that he is guiltie of Christs bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, which contemneth the same in his Sacrament: and either receiueth it negligently, or els refuseth to receiue it contumeliously. For, not only the reprobates receiue vnworthily, but sometimes also the elect, of whome the Apostle especially speaketh, disswading them from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing vnworthily, wherby, as by other sinnes, they pro uoke God to punish them, &amp; deserue eternal damnation, if god should deale with them according to their deserts. But to condemne a man for eating the bodie of Christ, who did eat only the figure of it, semeth great vniustice to Sander. And yet the scripture neuer saith, that any ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is condemned for eating the bodie of Christ, but for ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Sacrament vnworthily, he is guiltie of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die &amp; bloud of Christ, wherof that is a Sacrament. Tush (saith Sander) if it were so meant, the talk of Saint Paul would no more hang together, then if it were said: he y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> toucheth vnworthily the kinges garment, is guiltie of murthering his person. I answer, first the Sacrament of the bodie &amp; bloud of Christ is a thing y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> more neere co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerneth Christ, then y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> kings garment doth concerne the king, &amp; therfore the similitude is nought: but yet he y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> contempt toucheth the kings garment, is guilty of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of the kings person. And he that of malice, thru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steth his weapon through the kinges garment, might iustly be guiltie of murthering his person: euen so, and much rather, as the neglect or contempt of the Lords sa crament is lesse or more, so much is the guiltines against y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lords person, although his bodie &amp; bloud be no more touched by the contemners, then the kings person, by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> abusers of his garment, image, crown, scepter, seal, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument. Sander after this, professeth, that he is loath to heap vp in this place the manifold witnesses of the aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient fathers, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning that euil men eat Christs body, whose words he hath partly touched before, li. 2.

                        <hi>Timet, vt credo, diabolus ne morando locus poenitentiae detur: &amp; quasi a temulentia mentem suam rectius cogitans homo cripiat, hac de causa festinat &amp; impellit.

For this cause he maketh haste &amp; driueth forward. For with great celeritie, he driueth euen Iudas hedlong, when after the bread, he had altogither prepared him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, fearing both the delaie, and the vertue of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> blessing, least it hath kindled a sparke in his minde, and thereof hath lightened him, and drawen him to better thinges.</q> This saying of Cyrillus doth no lesse differ in sense and vnderstanding from Sanders slanderous report of him, then it doth in forme &amp; context of wordes, from that which Sander affirmeth to be his saying. For Cyrill plainly caleth it bread which Iudas had receiued.

The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he reasoneth thus: because S. Paul chargeth them to be guiltie, not onely of Christes worship and name, but also of his owne bodie and bloude, with which fault he neuer burthened any other then the vnworthy receiuers, or the Iewes that laide iniurious hands vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Christ at his death, it must needes be, that such a communicant recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth Christs naturall bodie. I answere, not onely they are guiltie of Christes bodie and bloude, which receiue the communion vnworthily, and which laide violent handes on Christes person, but euen they also, that cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifie the sonne of GOD againe, of whom the Apostle speaketh, Heb. 6. verse. 6. and corrupt the bloud of his Testament, by which they are sanctified wholy. Heb. 10. vers. 29. Neither are they burthened with a greater fault, then they committe, which vnworthily receiuing the pledge of Christes presence, are saide to offend against Christ himselfe. But Sander vrgeth the argument of discerning further: <hi>because the Apostle biddeth them put a difference betweene Christes bodie and all other meates or crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in the world, it is euident, that none other mea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Why then (saith Sander) <hi>if it were so, it had required more perfection in the law, then nowe is vsed forsomuch as we receiue our maker perhaps but once a yeare, and surely at the most but once a day, wheras they did eate Manna as often as hunger prouoked, for 40. yeares.</hi> The Law which is spirituall, requireth more perfection then any man can performe: but to argue what perfection is required of vs by that we vse corruptly, is as grosse a fault in reasoning, as theirs was in vnworthy receiuing. The scripture requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth oftner communicating then once a yeare. In the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitiue Church they receiued euerie day, &amp; so often they were to prepare and examine themselues.

But wee receiue but once a day, at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> most (saith hee,) verily they receiued oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, because it was not onelie a spirituall meate, but a bodily meate also necessarie for the maintenance of their liues, as our Sacrament is not, wee may eate breade which is not the Sacrament, so coulde not they at that time. Howe be it, when so euer wee come into the presence of God to pray, which wee ought to doe more then once a day, I would know, what prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration or examination, is necessarie for them that receiue
<pb n="656" facs="tcp:13044:337"/>
the Sacrament (excepting the onely relation of recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing) but a Christian man is bounde to vse the same as precisely when he offereth his prayers vnto God. I speak not (as Sander doth) howe vnreuerently men vse to pray, but how they ought to behaue themselues in the sight of God.</p>

Saint Paul calleth the Sacrament breade at the least sixe times, after consecration. As for the often repetition of flesh and bloude, in the 6. of saint Iohn, pertaineth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the Lords supper. But let vs see master Sanders autorities, for this argument of repetition. First Euthy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mius borrowing the saying out of Chrysostome, saith: <hi>Hoc dixit, This he saide, confirming that he spake not obscurely, or parabolically.</hi> Yea sir, but Euthymius saith otherwise, if it had pleased you to cite his saying whole:  <q>

<pb n="657" facs="tcp:13044:337"/>
or in parable. Chrysostome <hi>in Ioan. Hom. 46. Quid autem significat: caro mea verè est cibus, &amp; sanguis meus verè est potus? Aut quod is est verus cibus, qui saluat animam: aut ut eos in praedictis confirmet, ne obscurè locutum in parabolis arbitrarentur.</hi> What meaneth this: my flesh is meate in deede, and my bloude is drinke in deede? Either that he is the true meat, that saueth the soule: or else that hee might confirme them in that was saide before, lest they shoulde thinke that hee had spoken darkely in parables.</q> By both these places, which are disiunctiue sentences, it is plaine that the flesh and bloude of Christ is meate to feede the soule, which must needes be spiritually, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the soule cannot eate carnally, and then you see howe plaine and without parable the speach of Christ is to be taken.</p>
                  <p>Next these are cited Oecumenius <q>
                        <hi>

Secondly, that Cyrillus speaketh not of the wordes, whose repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition Sander vrgeth, but of the matter of our spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all feeding by Christ onely, often repeated in the sixte of Iohn. Thirdely that Cyrillus vnderstandeth the

matter of this Chapiter to bee all one, contrarie to that which Sander before hath stoutly defended, that Christ speaketh not of the Sacrament, vntill hee come to that saying, And the breade which I will giue, is my flesh.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, that Cyrill affirmeth Christ to haue beene the breade of life which was receiued of the godly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, vnder the figure of Manna: And last of all, that the wordes following, And the breade which I will giue, is my flesh, which I will giue for the life of the worlde, Cyrill vnderstandeth of the death of Christ, and not of the sacrament, for which Sander straue so much in the thirde Booke.</p>
                  <p>The saying of Cyrillus vpon the wordes of Christ: And the breade which I will giue, is my fleshe, &amp;c. is in the 12. Chapiter of the same Booke.  <q>

                  <p>The adoration of Christes bodie, is no question be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene vs, but whether the sacrament is to be adored, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Fulke.</note> thereby the reall presence might be proued. The place of the Psalme 22. after the Hebrewes, is this, verse 26. <q>I will paye my vowes before them that feare him. The poore or meeke shall eate, and be satisfied, they shall praise the Lord seeking him: your soule shall liue for euer. All the ends of the earth shall remember, and be conuerted vnto the Lord. And all the families of the Gentiles shall bow themselues before thee. Because the kingdome is the Lordes, and he hath dominion among the Gentiles.

But for as much, as Christ nourisheth the faithfull, otherwise then by the sacram<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t, it is great violence to draw this prophecie, only, or chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the sacrament, as Sander doth. As for adoration of the sacrament, heere is no colour for it. Christ promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth plainely, that such as he hath redeemed shall praise Iehoua, shall worship him, fall downe before him: but of worshipping the meate whereof they eate and are satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, there is no mention in the worlde. I passe ouer his fantasticall application of the words of the Psalme, and meddle onely with y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which is pertinent to the question. <hi>But the kingdome of God requireth an inuisible presence</hi> (saieth Sander) <hi>concerning the person of the king. But yet visible concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the formes of bread &amp; wine, to the end his mebers may know where to worship him.</hi> And must wee haue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> visible formes of bread and wine, that we may know where to worship him? Why, doe wee not knowe, that he is ascended into
<pb n="661" facs="tcp:13044:339"/>
heauen, and sitteth on the right hand of God the father? shall wee not worship him sitting at the right hande of god in heauen? S. Paul willeth vs to seek those things that are aboue, where Christ is, and not those things that are on earth, because Christ is in heauen. Col. 3. But that this interpretation of the Psalme, to be meant of the sacrament, is not of Sanders inuention, we must heare the iudgement of the elder writers. And first he begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth with Hierome in Psal. 21. <hi>Vota Christi:</hi> 
                     <q>The vowes of Christ are his natiuitie, and passion: the vowes of the church are good workes: or els I will offer the mysterie of my bodie and bloud, with them who celebrate those things in his feare. Although this writer referre the text</q> partlie to the mysterie of the bodie and bloud of Christ in the Sacrament, yet hath he no worde of adoration of the Sacrament: but reserreth it altogether to God and Christ, beside that his exposition farre differeth from Sanders explication. The like sayings he alleageth out of Augustine, Cassiodorus, Beda, &amp; Euthymius, all which affirm this prophesie of eating, to perteine to eating the body of Christ in the Sacrament, although not onely to it. But what say they to adoration of the Sacrament? For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sooth (saith Sander) <hi>manducauerunt &amp; adorauerunt,</hi> are both referred to one thing, they haue eaten the Sacrament, therfore they haue adored the Sacrament. I deny the <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ior:</hi> the text is plaine, that they haue adored, bowed, and fallen downe to God, &amp; not to that which they haue ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten. If I say, Sander hath eaten &amp; giuen thanks: do I mean that he hath giuen thanks to his meate, or to him that gaue him meate? This is a miserable argument. But S. Augustine doth fortifie it. For he saith vpon that Psalm, <q>Euen the rich of the earth haue eaten the body of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines of their Lord, neither are they so filled as y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> poore, euen vnto imitation, <hi>sed tamen adorauerunt,</hi> but yet they haue adored.</q> I heare that they haue worshipped, but I heare not that they haue worshipped or adored the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. And if you say they haue worshipped or adored the bodie of their Lords humilitie: how proue you, that they worshipped y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same really present in the Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t?
<pb n="662" facs="tcp:13044:340"/>
Or that the Sacrament may be called y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bodie of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> lords humilitie? If this wil not serue, Augustine is more plaine <q>

Chr. Ca 28. the footstoole of Gods feete. And y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the sense of this verse is all one with y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> last verse of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same Psalm, which euen the vulgar La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine interpreter readeth thus: <hi>Exaltate Dominum Deum no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strum, &amp; adorate in monte sancto eius: quoniam sanctus Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus Deus noster.</hi> Exalt ye y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lord our God, &amp; worship in his holy mountaine: because y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lord our God is holy. In both verses is one word of worshipping, the same pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position before y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> word, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> signifieth his footstoole, and y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> word which signifieth his hil or mountaine. Therfore y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Latine interpreter should not haue said worship his foot stoole, but worship in or at his footstoole, as he saith, in or at his holy hill. Wherefore, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Prophet Dauid in this place speaketh nothing for worshipping of the bodie of Christ any way, if his own words, rather then the words of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> translator be considered. Wherfore the foundatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of this worship of the Sacrament, is vtterly ouerthrowen. But Sander saith, <hi>that the Arke &amp; the temple being the foote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoole of God, toward which, the Iewes did pray, did signifie, that the flesh of Christ should be adored, not only in heauen, but also in the Sacrament, which is the arke, temple, &amp; vessel, conteining the self same substance of Manna, which sitteth at the right hand of God the Father.</hi> Did I not tell you in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> preface, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he would not proue the presence by the adoration, but the adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by the presence, which is all in question? who shall grant y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t is such an arke, temple, &amp; vessel, as he affirmeth? But many of the old fathers, vnderstood the footestoose for the bodie or flesh of Christ, affirming y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it was to be worshipped. To this I answer, first, they were all deceiued in their ground of scripture, that so tooke the footestoole. Secondly, some of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> affirming y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> flesh of Christ is to be worshipped, had no relation vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament. Thirdly, they y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> said it was to be worshiped in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sacrament, vnderstood worshipping otherwise then y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Pa pists teach &amp; practise, namely, for reuerencing of Christs

flesh in the mysteries, without any imagination of car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall presence. Hierom, the first author cited by Sander, for this purpose in Psa. 98. saith, <q>There be many opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ootstole, what it should be. But heere the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet meaneth our Lordes body, wherein the maiesty of the diuine nature standeth as it were on a footstoole.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is spoken of the humanity of Christ, without any respect vnto the Sacrament, therfore it followeth: <q>
                        <hi>Quid autem adorari debeat, &amp;c.</hi> And that he ought to be adored: the Apostles taught at his ascension, when they retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned vnto Ierusalem worshipping. But also these thinges are to bee referred to our Lordes crosse and to his holy soule. The next is Ambrose <hi>de Spir. Sanct. lib. 3. Cap. 13. Per scabellum, &amp;c.</hi> By the footstoole, the earth is vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standed, by the earth the flesh of Christ: which at this day also we adore in the mysteries: which the Apostles as we haue said before, did adore in our Lord Iesus: for Christ is not deuided, but one.</q> Here (saith Ambrose) the flesh of Christ is adored in the mysteries: he saith not that the mysteries are adored as the flesh of Christ. Christ is ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nored or contemned in the poore, in his Ministers, in Magistrates, in his word, in al his creatures: It follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not, that Christ is really present in the poore, in his Ministers, in Magistrats, in his word, in all his creatures. Neither can it be prooued, that by mysteries, Ambrose meaneth only the Sacrament of Christes supper. Againe when he saieth, wee worshippe the flesh of Christ in the mysteries, which the Apostles worshiped in Iesus Christ, it followeth, that the mysteries and Iesus Christ are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerse thinges, and not all one. But when the same Christ is worshipped in the mysteries, that was worshipped in his proper person, it followeth as Ambrose saieth, that Christ is one and not deuided. Thirdly, is cited Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine, in Psa. 98. who interpreting the footstoole to bee the flesh of Christ, which he hath giuen vs to be eaten to saluation, saith: <q>
                        <hi>Nemo autem illam carnem manducat, nisi pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us adorauerit, &amp;c.</hi> And no man eateth that flesh, except he haue first adored it, it is found out, how such a foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoole of our Lordes may be adored, and that we should
<pb n="665" facs="tcp:13044:341"/>
not only offend in adoring, but we should sinne in not adoring.</q> Here Augustine saith, the flesh of Christ must be adored before it be eaten: and who doubteth of that? For hee that honoureth not Christe come in the fleshe, shall neuer be nourished by his flesh and bloud. But Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine is so farre of, to teach vs that Christs flesh is to be adored, as really present in the Sacrament, that he doth expresly denie, his naturall body and bloud to be eaten and drunken, for thus hee saith to the Capharnaites in the person of Christ: as euen Sander reporteth: ye shall not eate this body, which you see, nor drink that bloud which they shall shedde, who shall crucifie mee. I haue commended a certeine Sacrament to you, being vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoode spiritually it will make you liue. Although it must needes be celebrated visibly, it must be vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded inuisibly. Howe thinke you Sander auoydeth the force of this place? First he saith, the last words must a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree with the first, and then both are true. Very well, he spake before of a spirituall manner of presence, and ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of Christ in the Sacrament, because he now denieth the corporall presence. Secondly he answereth, that Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine speaketh of the visible forme, and not of the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of the body of Christ, which is inuisible. O abho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable impudence. Augustine saith, you shal not eate this bodye, nor drinke that bloud. Sander saieth: <hi>These wordes body and bloud, are taken for visible formes, and not for the substance. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>r Christ tooke not that greatnesse and quantity of flesh of his mother, wherein he walked: for his greatnesse in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased from the state of an infant, to the state of a perfect man.</hi> But I pray thee Sander, if with shamefastnesse thou hast not lost all thy wit, tell me whether Christ was crucified in the state of an infant, or in the state of a perfect man? Augustine denieth the eating and drinking of that body which was crucified, and that bloud which was shedde, when he was crucified, which body also he demeth, that the Church hath present vpon earth. in Ioan Tr. 50. Tsll me whether it was the visible forme of bloud which was shedde on the crosse, or the very substance of his bloud. If thou say it was the very substance, which thou must
<pb n="666" facs="tcp:13044:342"/>
say, except thou be a Marcionite or Manichee, then it was the verie substance of his bloud, which Augustine deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to be drunken in the Sacrament.</p>
                  <p>But Augustine (saith Sander) was so fully persuaded, that the fleshe of Christ was to bee adored vnder the forme of bread, after consecration, that he reacheth the Christian people to adore it, not as common flesh, but as the flesh of God, for whose sake we adore it. <hi>Cù<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

And this difference is in two pointes, the first in due preparation of our selues, which is required in other sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentes to receiue the grace of God, the seconde is, in respect of the substance of the meate, that is receaued, which is to be honored and adored. I answere, the earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly substance is not to be adored, the heauenly substance is to be adored in heauen where it is really present, and not vppon the earth: and as well in Baptisme, as in the supper. But Chrysostome in 1. Cor. Hom. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Christ washeth vs in baptisme euen as hee feedeth vs in his supper, and hee purgeth vs with his bloode, as verily, as hee feedeth vs with his bodie and bloode. Neither doth Ambrose in 1. Cor. 11. meane any other thing: when he saith, Wee must iudge that he is the Lorde, whose blood we drinke in a mysterie. For to drinke the bloode of Christ in a mysterie, is to drinke it spiritually, by meane of a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, euen as to bee washed with the blood of Christ in a mysterie, is to bee purged by the bloode of Christ, by meane of the Sacrament of Baptisme.

                     </gap>o God, as is the humanitie of Iesus Christ our Sauiour. But Chrysostome saith further, in 1. Cor. Hom. 24. <hi>The verie table is the strength of our soule, the sinewes of the mind, the bond of confidence, our foundation, hope, health, light, life.</hi> I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere, this is nothing else, but the effect of our redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whereof we are assured, by participation of that ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. As for the heauenly substance, that it is in heauen, Chrysostome sufficiently declareth, when hee affirmeth in the same Homily, that we must become eagles, and flee into heauen, for where the dead bodie is, thither wil the eagles be gathered. Wherefore the adoration, that is defended cannot be prooued by the true substance of the sacrament considered, but by the reall presence and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonall vnion thereof vnto the outward elementes: which if Sander cannot shewe, hee laboureth in vaine, to tell vs of the true substance of the sacrament, which wee confesse to bee the bodie and bloode of Christ, vnto the worthie receiuer: but not personally vnited to that breade and wine, or the shapes of them. But nowe let vs heare, what he hath to say, out of Saint Augustine, Epi. 118. ad Ianuarium: who answereth the question: Whether they doe better, that receaue the communion euerie day, or they which at certaine times onely. <q>
                        <hi>Neuter eorum exhonorat &amp;c.</hi> Neither of them depriueth the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die and bloode of our Lorde of honour, if each of them
<pb n="674" facs="tcp:13044:346"/>
striue who may honor best, the most healthfull sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. For as well the Centurion as Zacheus did honor our Sauiour in manner by contrarie meanes: the one by receiuing him with ioie into his house: the other by saying, Lorde, I am not worthie, that thou shouldest en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter vnder my roofe. And as among the Iewes, Manna tasted to euerie man, according to his owne will, in the mouth of the faithfull: euen so it is to bee iudged, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the receiuing of that sacrament, into euery Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians mouth. For both one man for honor sake, doeth not take it euery day: an other for honors sake, dareth not to omitte to take it in any daie: As Manna would no loothsomenes, so this meate will no contempt. For the Apostle for that cause saith, it to haue beene vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily receiued of them, <hi>Qui hoc non discernebant a caeteris cibis veneratione singulariter debita,</hi> which did not discerne this thing, from other meates by a veneration singularly due. For streight, when he had said, he eateth &amp; drinketh damnatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to himself: be said moreouer, Not discerning our Lordes bodie, the which appeareth sufficiently in all that place in the first Epistle to the Corinthians, if it be diligently marked.</q> This place to Sander, seemeth mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueilous notable, for honor due to the sacrament. And who is he that thinketh the sacrament not to bee hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable? Verily hee that honoreth not the sacrament of baptisme, is an heretike: and yet hee that adoreth the water of baptisme as the holy Ghost, or as the bloode of Christ, is an idolater. But Sander hath no lesse then ten obseruations of this place, which for tediousnesse I will not rehearse all, but onely such as in which I dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent from him. In the fourth obseruation he noteth, that we must striue to honor the sacrament, whether by this meane or that it skilleth not, so it be honored. If he vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand of those two meanes, of which Augustine spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth. I agree with him, if he meane that it skilleth not by what meanes so euer we honor the sacrament, I say, he hath no such grounde in Saint Augustine. In the fifth obseruation he saith, <hi>If it were in deede the substance of bread and wine, hee would neuer exhort vs to bee so carefull, howe to
<pb n="675" facs="tcp:13044:346"/>
honor a meere creature, were it neuer so great a signe.</hi> I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere, we honour not a meere creature, when we honour the sacrament, for his sake that instituted the same: for we honour God, and yet the earthly substance of the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament is indeed the substance of bread and wine. We honor not a meere creature, when we honor a magistrat, and yet the magistrate, in substance is a man. In y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ninth obseruation, he asketh what is a veneration or worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping singularly due, but such a worship, of which sorte there is but one, and in the tenth hee saith, such a wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipping that onely is, which is due to God: who as he hath no fellow in nature: so he hath no partaker in honor. I aunswere, the veneration, honor, worship, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence, due singularly to the sacrament, is spoken of Augustine in comparison of all other meates, and not of all other thinges in generall. His wordes are, <hi>Which did not discerne the sacrament, from all other meates by a reuerence singularly due to it,</hi> that is to say, of all other meat, onely the sacrament ought to haue that reuerence or honor: E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen so the water of baptisme must bee discerned from all other waters, <hi>veneratione singulariter debita,</hi> by a vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration or reuerence singularly due vnto it, being conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated to the mysticall washing away of our sinnes, and yet no diuine honor must be giuen to the water of bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme. Wherefore S. Augustine meaneth nothing lesse, then that the sacrament shoulde bee worshipped as God &amp; man, really present vnder those visible shapes of bread &amp; wine, as Sander impudently doth slander him. <hi>But it is worthie to be remembred</hi> (saith he) <hi>That Augustine vseth the word Sacramentum, for the substance of Christes fleshe conteined vnder the signe of bread.</hi> Who wil graunt this vnto Sander? well, if you will not graunt it, he hath reason to prooue it. For Augustine (saith he) <hi>would neuer haue granted, that either the substance of materiall bread, or the forme thereof, ought to be honored. For honor can be giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to no vnreasonable creaturs.</hi> Is this that Sander, which defendeth the honoring of i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages? or else be images reasonable creatures? But hee careth not what he saith, so he may seeme to say some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, to the matter in hande.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="676" facs="tcp:13044:347"/>
In deede Augustine woulde neuer defende that diuice honor shoulde be giuen to the sacrament, but there is a kinde of honor, which may bee giuen, euen vnto the vnreasonable creatures, not in respect of themselues, but in respect of him, to whome all honor, and glorie is dewe, if they be of him taken and appointed to any ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable vse.</p>
                  <p>Last of all, we must consider, what it should meane, that Augustine saith, <hi>The Sacrament may bee honored by our absteining, sometimes from receiuing it into our mouthes, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as it is no honor to God, if wee shoulde any moment absteine to feede on him by faith, and in spirite. Therefore it is a worthier kinde of substance, which is receiued in the sacrament, then the grace is which is the effect of spirituall eating. For his grace cannot come, except wee first bee made meete to receaue it. But his bodie maye come to our bodies, and so maie condemne vs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we are meete to receiue it.</hi> To this friuolous collecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on I aunswere, that there is no honor done to the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, by absteining from it, but by humilitie, as the similitude of the Centurion declareth, who coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted himselfe vnworthie that the Lorde shoulde come vnder his roofe. Againe, Augustine defendeth not the acte of either of both partes, as good of it selfe, but ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king that to be indifferent, he onely defendeth their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and meaning, which was to yeelde due reuerence to the Lordes sacrament, the one by often receauing, the other by humble intermission, least the offences, shoulde in their weake nature, breede contempte of so high a mysterie. For although wee ought continually to feed on Christ by faith, yet it is not necessarie, nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient, nor possible that the pledge and seale of this spirituall feeding, shoulde euerie moment be receaued. But only at such times, as the Church &amp; Elders thereof shall thinke expedient, for the renuing of our remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, and confirming of our faith by the visible tokens of Christes institution. So that no worthier substance can bee gathered to bee receaued in the Sacrament, then the grace of God. And where Sander saith, that his grace cannot come, except wee bee first made meete to

                     </gap> I answere, that we are not made meete to receiue the grace of God, but onely by the grace of God preuenting all preparation of our owne. As for his bodie comming into our bodies, when it is prooued out of the worde of God, it shalbe graunted, but not before.</p>
                  <p>Finally, whereas he gathereth it is the same substance of Christ, which is receiued: of which y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Centurion said, I am not worthie y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thou shouldest enter vnder my roofe: I answere, he may no more vrge the substance of Christ, in the one similitude of the Centurion, then he wil alow me to vrge it is not the same substance, by the other si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude of Manna, which Augustine likewise vseth. As for the same words of the Centurion, vsed in the Lytur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie, ascribed to Chrysostome in adoring the sacrament, I denie that any adoration is meant vnto the Sacrament, or that those wordes are spoken vnto the Sacrament, but vnto Christ in heauen, whose Sacrament that is. What is said or done in the Masse booke, I neither knowe, nor care. That Origen Hom. 5. <hi>in diuersos,</hi> exhorteth them that receiue the Sacrament, to vse that speach of the Centuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, it prooueth neither adoration, nor carnall manner of presence. For immediatly before, he hath these wordes: <q>

As for Pachymeres cannot be elder then his autor Dionyse, on whom he writeth his Paraphrasis. The next is Cyprian, which lib. 2. Ep. 3. saith, that our sacrifice is Christ: but Christ is to bee adored (saith Sander:) <hi>ergo</hi> the sacrifice which is the Sacrament. I answere, whatsoeuer after any manner is called Christ, is not to be adored. Whosoeuer receiueth any of Christs disciples, receiueth Christ: but hee shalbe an Idolater, if he giue diuine honour to him, which is due onely to the person of Christ. The like answere I make to that Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brose saith, <hi>de ijs qui myst. cap.</hi> 9. that Christ is in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament: To Ignatius, Ep. <hi>ad Rom.</hi> calling the Sacrament the breade of God, the heauenly breade, the breade of life: To Euseb. lib. 10. cap. 10. calling it a Sacrifice full of God, and the dreadfull Sacrifices of Christes table: To Cyrillus, lib. 3. <hi>in Ioan cap.</hi> 37. saying, that by the mysteries wee are made partakers of the diuine nature. Neither doe the sayings of Cyrillus, nor Hilarius, lib. 4. cap. 18. prooue a personall vnion of Christ with the Sacrament, when they say it maketh Christ to dwell in vs corporal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and by a naturall participation: for they say not so simplie, but vnder a Sacrament, vnder a mysterie: &amp;c. that is, the Sacrament doth assure vs, that wee are truely made partakers of the bodie and bloude of Christe, after an heauenly and diuine manner, and not onely are ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned

to him in loue and faith, and will, but are made flesh of his flesh, and bone of his bone, by his incarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and holy spirite, vniting vs vnto him, in a mysti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal bodie, not in a personal vnion: for if any thing which is truely the bodie of Christ, must be adored with diuine honour, the Church of God should bee so adored, which is the bodie of Christ, and so called in the Scripture.</p>
                  <p>Finally Hesychius calling the Sacrament the breade of life, and the mysticall loaues, which quicken vs, &amp;c. gaue no diuine honour vnto it, as personally vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vnto Christ, but as to an holy mysterie, and seale of our spirituall feeding and coniunction with Christ. For Hesychius affirmeth, that mysterie to bee both breade and flesh, in Leuit. lib. 2. chap. 8. But Sander vppon these sayings, buildeth that the Fathers affirmed, that which was on the table, to bee the diuine substance, yea the substance and nature of God which is to be adored, and cannot be eaten corporally, but in the Sacrament. And yet no one father, that hee hath cited, saieth any such thing. If Cyrill say, we are by the mysteries made par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of the diuine nature: Saint Peter saith by Gods promises we are made partakers of the diuine nature, 2. Pet. 1. Yet not of the diuine substance: And to saye, the Godheade can be corporally eaten, in the Sacrament, it is monstrous heresie. When Cyrillus saith, Christ dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth in vs corporally, hee saith not by eating the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, wee eate GOD or Christ corporally, but the power of the mysticall blessing maketh Christ to dwell in vs corporallie, by participation of the fleshe of Christ.</p>
                  <p>But let vs yet heare a more full witnesse, which is Chrysostome in 1. Cor. Hom. 24. the place although it be fully answered by mee against Heskins lib. 2. cap. 45. yet because Sander maketh so manie obseruations vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, I will set it downe againe. <hi>Hoc corpus &amp;c.</hi> The wise men reuerenced this body in the manger: and being men without good religion and barbarous, they worshipped it with feare and much trembling after a long iourney
<pb n="680" facs="tcp:13044:349"/>
taken. <q>Let vs therefore who are the citizens of heauen, at lest follow those barbarous men. For when they sawe, the manger and cottage, and not any of those thinges which thou nowe seest: they came with most great reuerence and quaking. But thou seest that thing, not in the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, but in the Altar: not a woman which might hold it in her armes: but the Priest present, and the holy ghost copiously spredde vpon the sacrifice which is set foorth: Neither lookest thou barely vpon the bodie, as they did: but thou knowest the power of it, and al the order of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spensing thinges. And thou art ignorant of none of these thinges, which were done by him, and thou hast beene diligently instructed in all things. Let vs be stirred vp therefore, let vs quake, and let vs professe openly a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter deuotion, then those barbarous men: lest if we come barely, and coldly, we ieoparde our head into a more ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement fire.</q> Out of this place Sander would haue the reall presence and adoration of the sacrament prooued. But this place prooueth neither of both. For he spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth figuratiuely, of seeing the bodie of Christ, of see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the holy ghost spredde vpon the Sacrifice, &amp;c. which cannot bee referred to the eyes of the bodie, but must needes haue a spirituall vnderstanding. The bodie of Christ is so present, as it may be seene, but it cannot bee seene but spiritually, therefore it is not present but spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually. This is sufficient to shewe that Chrysostome spake not of the popish reall presence, therefore not of their manner of adoration. Nowe let vs see what wise arguments Sander can picke out of this place.</p>
                  <p>First we must note these comparisons: The Altar, the Manger, the Virgin, the Priest, the Wisemen, the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, the adoration of the one and the other: but this last comparison is forged, for Chrysostome requireth our i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation of the wise men, in comming to the Sacrament with reuerence and trembling, with earnest desire and affection, not in giuing honour to the outwarde crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, but to him y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is seene by faith. Further, Sander char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth him to say, it is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same bodie in both places, which Chrysost. saith not, although it be the same body which
<pb n="681" facs="tcp:13044:349"/>
is receiued spiritually in the Sacrament, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> that which y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wise men did worship: yet it followeth not, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the same real body is present vpon the altar before it be receiued, to bee there worshipped. Sander vrgeth Chrysostomes words, <hi>vides in altari,</hi> thou seest it on the altar. <hi>Lo it is vpon the altar, and not onely comprehended by faith, but by the meane of the forme of bread it is seen.</hi> What say you, Sander? is the body of Christ seene? then is hee present visibly. It is a madde kinde of corporall sight of his bodye which is through the forme of bread. You were wont to tell vs, that a substance is said to be seen, where the proper acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents thereof are seene. And are the accidents of bread the signes now of the body of Christ? O newe Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy and Theology! but I pray you sir, if the body of Christ be not only comprehended by faith, but also seen by meane of the forme of bread: by what meane is the holy ghost seen? whom Chrysostome likewise affirmeth to be seen as the body of Christ is. Will you neuer be ashamed of those impudent shiftes, in wresting the holy scriptures, and sayinges of the ancient fathers? As for the foure reasons that Christian men should rather wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship the Sacrament, then the wise men did Christ in the cottage, be in vaine. For Chrysostom draweth no exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of their worshipping, to worshippe that which is visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly seene in the Sacrament, or the elementes thereof, but of comming with reuerence vnto the bodye of Christ, which is really in heauen, whereof we are made parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers after an heauenly and spirituall manner in the Sacraments, not by bringing the body of Christ downe vnto vs, but by our ascending vp vnto him, as Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostome sheweth plainly, by that long allegory of the Eagles, which he vseth in the 24. Homily. Neither doth Chrysostome say, that as those vngodly barbarous men, did worshippe his body in the manger, and handes of a woman, so we being godly and ciuil, must worshippe it lying on the altar, or in the priestes hands, in the forme of bread. But he exhorteth by this exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple, his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors, to come often, decently, &amp; with dew reuerence &amp; preparation, to the participation of the holy mysteries,

in which the same body of Christ (though after an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther manner) is seene and dispensed.</p>
                  <p>But Chrysostom saith more plainely, Hom. 28. <hi>I will shewe thee that in the earth, which is worthy of highest honor.</hi> Where can he shewe it (saieth Sander) but on the altar, pointing to the host? Yes forsooth, he can shew it to the eies of faith: for to the bodily eies he can shew nothing but breade and wine, which is worthy of small honour. But yet it followeth more plainely, <hi>As in the pallaces of Kinges, not the walles, not the golden roofe, but the Kinges body f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>tting in the seate of maiestie, is the worthiest thing of all: so is the body of Christ the worthiest thing in heauen, which is now sett forth to the earth, to be seene.</hi> What could y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> greatest Papist in Europ say more, quoth Sander? Verily no Papist that is aduised what hee saith, will say the body of Christ is set forth on earth to be seene, but onely by the eies of faith: and so the Lord of all thinges, is shewed by preaching, by ministring of the Sacramentes, but not to bee seene with eies of the body, but with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> eies of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mind. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore seing Christ is set forth to be seene on earth, which sight cannot be but by faith, Chrysostome meaneth of a spiritual sight, shewing, &amp; manner of presence, and not of a bodily sight, shewing, or manner of presence. Neither doe we inuent any shiftes, as Sander saith, to auoide the adoration in question, for it shall neuer be prooued, that the Sacrament was adored in the primitiue Church, in such sort as it is worshipped and commanded by the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistes. But beside Chrysostome, wee must haue a plaine authority of Theodoret, who disputing against an Euty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chian, that denieth the humanity of Christ, reproueth him by the example of the Sacrament, wherein two thinges are found: (saith Sander) but Theodoret saieth there are two natures and substances, breade and wine, and the body and bloud of Christ. <q>
                        <hi>Neque enim signa mysti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca,</hi> for the mysticall signes after sanctification, depart not out of their nature. For they remaine in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer substance, figure and forme.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>But now heare y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> shameles glosse of Sander. <hi>In substance,
<pb n="683" facs="tcp:13044:351"/>
because the formes of bread and wine subsist, by the power of God, and haue their being now by them selues, as they had it before in the nature of bread and wine.</hi> So that in substances is not in substance, but in accidentes, wherevpon it will followe in Theodorets argument, that Christ hath not now the substance of his humanity, but the substance of accidents thereof. Secondly hee saieth, <hi>The formes remaine in their former nature, because they nourish no lesse, then the substance of bread it selfe would haue done, if it had remained.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And is it the shapes or formes of bread and wine that nourished before, while the substance remained? was it the former nature of the formes, to nourish? O monster of impudency! If the substance and not the shapes did nourish, the shapes now nourishing as this new Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sopher affirmeth, remaine not in their former nature, but haue taken vpon them a newe nature, which no formes or shapes beeing accidents euer had before. But hitherto Sander hath done nothing, but by intollerable impudence, sought to shift of the authority of Theodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret, which is so plaine and direct against transubstanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation.</p>
                  <p>Now followeth the place for adoration, which he ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth in Greeke, for more credit <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> &amp;c. The mystical signes are vnderstoode to bee those thinges, which they are made, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, and are beleeued &amp; reuerenced. Sander had rather say, <hi>adored as being those thinges which they are beleeued to be.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Heere can be no lesse, then reall presence and adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And yet Theodoret meaneth neither of both in such sorte as Sander would haue him. The mysticall signes are spiritually the bodye and bloud of Christ, so to be beleeued and so to be esteemed, reuerenced, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nored, and adored, not by any actuall conuersion of the elementes into the bodye and bloud of Christ, but by the grace of God making the same spiritually, which the signes represent outwardly.</p>
                  <p>And so shal Theodoret expound himselfe, <hi>Dialogo primo,
<pb n="684" facs="tcp:13044:352"/>
Qui enim &amp;c.</hi> He which called his naturall body, wheat and bread, and nameth himselfe againe a vine, euen hee hath honoured the tokens that are seene, with the name of his body and bloud: not changing their nature, but adding grace vnto the nature.

                  <p>
                     <pb n="685" facs="tcp:13044:352"/>
But Chrysostome <hi>ad pop. Antioch. Hom.</hi> 61. vppon the same saith: <q>
                        <hi>Considera, &amp;c.</hi> Marke, I pray you, the kingly table is set before the Angels ministring at the table, the king himselfe is present, and thou standest by idle. Thy garments are foule, and thou carest not. But if they are cleane, then adore and receiue.</q> This adoration Sander would referre to the holy things, but he cannot enforce it, wee adore and communicate, yet wee adore not the Sacrament.</p>
                  <p>Chrysostome in the same Homilie saith: that we eate him which sitteth aboue, which is worshipped of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, &amp;c. by which it is euident, that the presence of Christ in the mysteries, is after a spirituall manner, not that he is bodily present. As for the eleuation, and the things praised with an hymne, that Dionysius speaketh, although they prooue no adoration of the Sacrament, yet I will not stande vpon them, because it is cleare that Dionysius was a writer out of the compasse of sixe hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth yeres, that Sander hath bound himselfe vnto, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer the Papistes impudently woulde affirme, that he was Saint Paules scholler, whose writinges were not heard of in the Church for sixe hundred yeres after Christ.

One is holy (saide they) one is the Lorde, one Iesus Christ in the glorie of GOD the father, with the holy Ghost, Amen.</p>
                  <p>But these are wordes of declaration, who is holy, not of inuocation. Wherefore the wordes of inuocation
<pb n="686" facs="tcp:13044:353"/>
were some prayer that was made for the worthie recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of the mysteries, and not made to the mysteries, as Sander imagineth. And wheras vpon the worde <gap reason="foreign">

                  </p>
                  <p>This place being altogether of spirituall beholding, honouring, &amp; receiuing, yet is not Sander ashamed to cite it for carnall presence, and ad oration of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. But howe I pray you? forsooth, hee telleth vs where to haue it: on the altar. Naye sir, faith respecteth not things that are visible, therefore not the altar, nor that is seene vpon it, but him that is in heauen, which is represented by that which is seene corporally.</p>
                  <p>Nowe, seeing the beholding must bee with faith, and the receiuing with the hande of the heart, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward swallowing: who will graunt vnto Sander, that the honouring must bee with outwarde reuerence, to that which appeareth breade and wine, but with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde and spirituall reuerence, dewe to Christ which is in heauen?</p>
                  <p>But Sander hath a quarell against the English Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, for translating <hi>altare</hi> the communion, and <hi>salutari cibo potúq<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>And whereas Sander sayeth, none other Lorde en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treth vnder the roofe of his mouth, beside that breade: I marueile, whether he meane to teache vs, that <hi>tectum</hi> is Latine for the roofe of a mans mouth, whereas wee haue alwayes taken it for the roofe of an house. Christe is sayde to enter vnder the roofe of our house figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuely, when hee dwelleth in vs by faith spiritually. As for eating vnder the roofe of our mouth, it is a grosse imagination vnworthie of the maiestie of Christ.</p>
                  <p>The last author is Cyrillus of Ierusalem in Catech. Mystag. 5. who biddeth the communicants, to take the king and the bodie of Christ in the hollow of the right hande, saying, Amen, and to sanctifie their eyes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, vsing all diligence, that no crumme thereof perishe or fall away. What needed that precept (saith hee) if it were common bread?</p>
                  <p>Verely, I take it for a meere superstitious precept, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it were giuen to young nouices, newly admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the communion: and yet it prooueth not the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish reall presence, vnlesse you thinke a legge or an arme falleth off, if a crumme be lost. What, when a mouse eateth vp all in the Pixe? And what can it be but the substance of breade which hath crummes, that may fall from it?</p>
                  <p>Cyrillus in the same place sayeth: <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. For whatsoeuer thou shalt leese, it is manifest, that in it thou hast lost as it were, parte of thine owne bodie.</p>

                     <pb n="688" facs="tcp:13044:354"/>
I thinke you will not say, that the bread is changed into the bodies of the communicants, that in leesing a crum, they leese a parte of their bodies. Hee meaneth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a spirituall reuerence to be giuen to the holy my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries, which was signified in careful keeping of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal figures. Well, after the communion of the bodie, <hi>Cyrillus biddeth the people come to the chalice of Christes bloud, bowing downe, and saying in the manner of adoring &amp; worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, Amen.</hi> If he bad the people come to the chalice of Christes bloud, he was no Papist, &amp; though he bid them come bowing downe, &amp; saying in worshipping. Amen: yet you finde not that he biddeth them bowe downe to the chalice, or to adore that which is in it, as you do. We come to the communion with reuerent gesture and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing downe, yet we adore not the Sacrament. But if hee meant adoring of the Sacràment, why did he not bidde them bow downe and worship the bread, as well as the cuppe?</p>
                  <p>Finally, that Cyrillus acknowledged no transub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiation, it is plaine by his words in the same booke: where hee sheweth y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> after the ministers of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> church are sanctified by the spirituall hymnes that were song, they besought their louing God to sende his holy spirit vpon the things that were set foorth, and to make that bread the bodie of Christ, and that wine the bloud of Christ. Then it followeth, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                  <p>The sayings of the doctors, because he hath alreadie <note place="margin">Fulke.</note> alleaged in euery article &amp; Chapter, he professeth nowe briefely to shewe, by what generall Chapters a man may be vndoubtedly assured of their beliefe &amp; doctrin. And first, because diuerse of them alleage the almightie power of God to defende the veritie of those wordes and deedes: I answere, that allegation prooueth no real pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence. For the almightie power of God is more consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered in feeding vs with the bodie and bloud of Christ, which is in heauen, then in Popish transubstantiation. Yet Sander misunderstandeth Irenaeus, li. 4. ca. 34. as hee misquoteth lib. 5. for lib. 4. <hi>How can they be sure, the breade wheron thankes are giuen to be the bodie of their Lord, &amp; the cup of his bloud, if they say not him to be the sonne of the maker of the world?</hi> In these wordes Irenaeus reasoneth not of the diuine power of Christ, which the heretikes granted, but they denied him to be y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sonne of that God, which made y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world: therfore, by the institutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Sacrament in bread &amp; wine, which are creatures of the world, Irenaeus proueth, that the father of our Lord Iesus Christ, was the maker of the world, &amp; not another iust God, as the here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes affirmed.

                  <p>The second general Chapter is, that no man requireth credit to be giuen to a figuratiue speach, but the fathers require credit to be giuen vnto it, therfore it is not figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratiue.

What a miracle Sander hath founde! but what thing is that which is visibly receiued, breade and wine, or the bodie of Christ? It must needes be the body of Christ (saith he) vnder the forme of breade, for nothing els is to be eaten spiritually. And is the body of Christe present inuisibly, as all Papistes affirme, and yet recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued visibly? This is strange Logike. But why may not the breade and wine be eaten and drunken spiritually, when they are by faith vnderstoode to be the sacrament of the body and bloud of Christ, to feede the soule as they are corporally digested into the bodie? be not our soules washed spiritually by meanes of the water in bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme?</p>

&amp;c. it is a great vntrueth, that Sander affirmeth Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rengarius to haue bene the first that preached &amp; taught against the reall presence. For the opinion of the reall presence was not taught before Antichrist was openly shewed in the see of Rome in any place, nor immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after commonly receiued, but in the seuenth or eight hundreth yere, as superstition, idolatrie, and false doctrine began to increase, both in the East and West: it began to take strength, but yet not to be fully confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, as it appeareth in the writings of Damaseene, the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conde Councell of Nice, and other writers since that time. Neither was the errour then vnreprooued, for the Councell of Ephes. 3. which condemned images, gaue a true vnderstanding of the supper. Bertrame, whome Sander affirmeth to be but suspected in his booke <hi>De corpore &amp; sanguine Domini,</hi> which is extant for euery man to reade, plainly determineth against the Popish reall presence and transubstantiation.</p>
                  <p>And whereas Sander offereth a large scope, as he saith, that we should name one bishop in the whole earth, who before the time of Berengarius, reprooued the tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers of the reall presence, as heretikes: I can name none so conueniently as Aelfricke, sometime Archbishop of Canterburie, with al the Saxon bishops in his time, who set foorth an Homily to be read on Easter day vnto the people, and allowed certeine Epistles of the saide Ael<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fricke, in which is conteined a plaine and manifest de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyall of that bodily presence, for which wee striue, and an approbation of the onely spirituall manner of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, which wee teache.</p>
                  <p>If Sander will cauill, that although they so taught they reproued not the teachers of the reall presence as heretikes I referre it to the iudgement of all indifferent men, how they would haue accused any man that obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately should haue maintained a doctrine contrarie to their common beliefe and consent. Howe the fathers of the primitiue Church beleeued, concerning the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Sacrament, &amp; namely S. August. (whom Sander half
<pb n="696" facs="tcp:13044:358"/>
suspecteth, and yet saith he is not against them, because his communion is not forsaken) it hath ben plentifully and often shewed, &amp; is not here to be repeted.</p>
                  <p>But Hilarie saith, it is the profession of our Lorde, &amp; the faith of the Church, that the Sacrament is truely the flesh and bloud of Christ: therefore there is no place left of doubting. Certeinly we doubt not, but to the worthy receiuer, the Sacrament is the same which Christ affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth it to be, after a spirituall manner: but wee are out of doubt, that our Sauiour Christ reteining the nature of his bodie, would not make the same insensible, impal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable, incircumscriptible, &amp;c. It is not therefore the presence, nor the reall presence rightly vnderstood, but the bodily presence, which we denye, and no man affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med for sixe hundred yeres after Christ, except perhaps Marcus the heretike, that changed the colour of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wine by inchantment, that it might bee thought that Christe had dropped his bloud into his chalice, as Irenaeus testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth, lib. 1. Cap. 9.</p>
                  <p>Likewise, we aunswere to Epiphanius, we belieue the wordes of Christ to be true, which by grace hath giuen vs bread and wine to bee his bodie and bloud spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, euen as the water of baptisme to be regeneration, which similitude Epiphanius vseth, euen as he doth this of the supper, to shewe that wee are truely made accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the image of God, not by nature, but by grace. Epiph. Anch.</p>
                  <p>But Sander hath a pleasant similitude to shewe, that the Papistes are not gone from the Apostles, and aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent fathers, because a man liuing in these dayes, should be vniustly charged with treason, for disobeying of William the Conquerour, or being the sonne of him that disobeyed William the Conquerour, when he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swereth, that he liued not vnder that king, and al his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestours in their dayes were obedient to such kings vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der whome they liued. A worshipfull similitude. But if William the Conquerour made a lawe, that whosoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer committeth these things, or these things, shalbe dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
<pb n="697" facs="tcp:13044:358"/>
a traitour, and it is prooued that thou hast com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted some of them, what will the former answere a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile thee? it is the doctrine, and not the persons of the Apostles and auncient fathers, from which you are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused to haue departed. But which of the successours of the Apostles (saith Sander) sent Berengarius to preach that doctrine, whereof they helde the contrary? I aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere, so long as Berengarius taught that doctrine, which the Apostles themselues commaunded to bee taught, he needed no speciall commission from them y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> were departed from the Apostles doctrine, to reprooue them, for he was sent of God, who opened his eyes to see the trueth, and their errours, that sitting in the chaires of the Apostles, taught a doctrine contrarie to the faith of the Apostles.</p>
                  <p>But Sander will at once prooue that all citizens of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> house of God, through the world, witnessed w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> one voice, and in one worde, that they beleeued the bodily pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence. For the olde custome was, at the wordes of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secration, and at the time of the receiuing the Sacrament, which was saide to be the bodie and bloud of Christ, to say, Amen: that is, to affirme it was so. And this Sander prooueth by manie witnesses, which is needelesse: for wee knowe it as well as he. But this prooueth no car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall nor bodily manner of presence, except Sander can proue, that it was tolde them, this to bee the body and bloud of Christ, without any figure, really, corporally, present vnder the onely shapes of bread and wine, as they teache nowe. <hi>Yes</hi> (saith Sander) <hi>a figuratiue speach soundeth otherwise, then we must thinke, whereto (Amen). must not be answered</hi> What shall wee then answere to these wordes of Christ, This cuppe is the newe testament in my bloud? are not these the wordes of consecration also?</p>
                  <p>But what was meant by Amen, and what the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is, S. Augustine teacheth <q>

                  <p>But Leo, Ser. 6. de Ieiu. 7. mensis saith, <q>
                        <hi>Sic sacrae, &amp;c,</hi> you ought so to communicate of the holy table, that ye dout nothing at all, of the trueth of the body and bloode of Christ, for that thing is taken in the mouth, which is beleeued in faith. And Amen is in vaine answered of them who dispute against that which is receiued.</q> In these sayings Sander vrgeth, that it is receaued with the mouth, as though Leo did meane, that whatsoeuer was beleeued in faith, was receaued in the mouth, yet the worde is <hi>are sumitur,</hi> it is receaued by the mouth, which is not all one with, in the mouth. For the bodie of Christ may be receaued by the mouth, as by an instrument that receaueth the visible sacrament thereof, and yet the body is not receaued into the mouth. But Leo speaketh ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestly, against the Manichees, which denied that Christ had a true bodie: exhorting Christians not to doubte thereof, for except they beleeued faithfully, that Christ had a true bodie, they coulde not with their mouth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue a sacrament of that body, which they beleeued not to bee, nor truely answere Amen, when they dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted against the trueth of that bodie whereof the visible sacrament was a signe, token, and argument, and so v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by Tertullian, againste the Marcionites that like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise denyed the veritie of Christes body.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore in this Chapter, Sander prooueth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing lesse then in the title he promiseth.</p>

                  <p>His title is of no man possibly, but his demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <note place="margin">Fulk.</note> is a simple poore man persuaded chanceably so by his teachers vpon coulour of Christes almightie power, and will pretended in promising, that he will giue his fleshe and wordes, in saying; this is my body. As for them that are simplie deceaued, they stand or fal to God, I will neither iudge of their condemnation, nor absolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But such as obstinately defende, that error, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie to their owne conscience, as a great number of the Papistes, which pretende faith, and seeke nothing else but the ouerthrowe of faith, and the glorie of God, for as much as that error employeth a deniall of the trueth of Christes humanitie, and consequentlie the trueth of the resurrection of our bodies, which must be made like vnto the glorious bodie of Christ, and infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth manifest Idolatrie in worshipping that for GOD, which is a meere creature: I see not howe they can es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape eternall damnation. As for their defence which Sander maketh, is friuolous. First of the almightie power of God, which is to doe whatsoeuer he will, and is agre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to his glorie, and not whatsoeuer we will imagine. He can not therfore make his body to be in many pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces at once, or to bee without dimension of quantitie, or to bee inuisible and intangible, because hee hath determined of his will to the contrarie in fiue hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth places of scripture. which testifie of the trueth of his humanitie, like vnto his bretheren in all poyntes, without sinne. Neither doeth it derogate from his omnipotencie, that hee can not doe contrarie to his will, which were against his owne glorie.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="700" facs="tcp:13044:360"/>
It is no infirmitie in God, that he cannot lye, that hee cannot sinne, that he cannot denie himselfe, nor doe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie to his will &amp; glory; but an argument of his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, wisedome, and goodnesse.</p>
                  <p>And whereas Sander saith, that Christ hath determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned his will in saying: The bread which I wil giue, is my flesh, which I will giue for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> life of the world: I answere, hee hath determined no such will of giuing his flesh in the Sacrament by these wordes, but of giuing his flesh to suffer death for the redemption of the worlde, which is the bread whereof he speaketh so often in that Chapiter to be eaten spiritually by faith, not onely in the supper, but in baptisme, &amp; without both y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sacraments, by faith onely, which was eaten of all the faithfull before the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation of Christ, without the eating of which breade of life, no mortall creature can bee partaker of eternall life. Further, where Sander saith: that Christ saide, This is my bodie, and gaue his twelue disciples twelue frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments or peeces, whereby he shewed, that hee made the substance of his body present vnder y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> formes of bread in diuers places &amp;c: I answere, he declared no will of multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying his bodie in diuers places at one time by such words or fact. For seeing he had so often before testified, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> truth of his humanity, in somuch y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he termed himselfe vsually, the sonne of man, and afterward offered his body to be touched and handled for triall of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> truth of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection: these wordes were not sufficient, to teach his disciples, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> his natural bodie could at one time be visible and inuisible, tangible and intangible, in locall situati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and not in locall situation, to be whole in one place, and whole in manie places, to haue quantitie actually of length bredth, and thickenes, &amp; to haue no quantitie, actually of length breadth &amp; thicknes: these contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions I say being against nature, reaso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, sense, his former doctrine, and the scriptures touching the trueth of his naturall bodie, and his argument taken of the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses after his resu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="701" facs="tcp:13044:360"/>
phrase, where no like vnderstanding could be imagined, and the scripture speaking of the sacraments, vseth ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily to call them by the names of these things where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of they are sacramentes. Wherefore there is no doubt, but the disciples vnderstood these words figuratiuely, sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentally, and spiritually. And concerning the frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and peeces whereof Sander speaketh, he is a sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to call them fragments or peeces of bread, as Cyril<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus doth, of whom he borowed the phrase, lest he should acknowledge breade to be any part of the Sacrament. But what declaration can he make of the will of Christ, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning transubstantiation of the breade into his bodie, which euen the schoolemen affirme, cannot be prooued out of the scriptures? And seeing Sander in his fond Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logisme, induceth Christ saying: that one of his works cannot be contrarie to another: seeing his ascension, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biding in heauen, and comming from thence to iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, are contrarie to this imagined presence; and those articles are plainely and manifestly set forth to be belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued: howe can these onely foure wordes, This is my bodie, which may haue another interpretation, agreeable to all the sayings and workes of God, make such a decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the will of Christ, as thereby the trueth of his humanitie remaining after it was assumed of the deitie and the resurrection of our bodies depending thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the ascension, abyding of Christ in heauen, and his comming from thence to iudgement: although in words they be not denyed, yet are and must be brought in doubt, question and vncerteintie? The other false bragges of this interpretation, vniuersally receiued and alwayes taught and beleeued, I omitte, with his shameles slaunders of Luthers life, and death, wherof the one hath beene sufficiently, and many times confuted: the other is so well knowen, and to so manie wise and godly, with whom he liued and among whom he dyed, that next vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the autoritie of the scriptures, no one thing more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scouereth the falshood of the Papists, then their impude<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t slanders and lyes, maliciously deuised against the true professors of the Gospel.</p>

But because the words of both their bookes were too large to bee inserted in this his volume, hee hath chosen the pyth of either (as hee affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth) with such fidelitie, as Master Iewell should finde no fault with him. For my part, I was likewise purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to haue omitted the answere of this appendix, partly because Master Iewels defense of the Apologie, being set foorth after this booke of Sander, the chiefe mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters are therein by Master Iewel himselfe wayed and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered: partly, because Sander, bringeth no newe mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in this replie, but either such as he hath brought in the sixe bookes before: and partly because his chiefe and most generall answere, is nothing, but a begging of the whole matter in controuersie, with an affirming and denying, grounded vpon his owne authoritie. By meanes whereof in this one article, he hath noted iump 218 vntruethes: howe well and iustely, let the readers of his booke, and Master Iewels replie, be iudges.

                  <argument>
                     <p>Master Iewell hath not answered Doctor Harding well, tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching <note place="margin">Sander.</note> the wordes of Christes supper in this article, Fol. 316. The people was not taught in the first sixe hundreth yeares, to beleeue, that Christs bodie is really, substantially, corporally, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, or naturally in the Sacrament.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>To giue a tast (as I promised) of Sanders collection of vntrueths, I will examine a fewe. <note place="margin">Fulke.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>The first vntruth is noted to be this: Master Iewell said, Whether Christes body be corporally in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Harding answereth not one worde. Harding had saide, The termes really, substantially &amp;c. are sounde in the doctors, treating of the true being of Christs bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die in the Sacrament, <hi>Ergo</hi> (saith Sander) Master Iew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell saide not truely: for hee prooueth afterwarde, Christes bodie to bee in the Sacrament. Heere the reason of this vntrueth is, the whole matter in contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersie, whether Harding haue proued in deed that which he intended.</p>
                  <p>The 2. vntruth. Iewell saith, in this matter hee is able to alledge nothing for direct proofe. Harding had saide, Christian people haue euer beene so taught, of that kind of prese<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, which is founded vpon Christs plaine words: <hi>Ergo</hi> saith Sander, hee was able to alleage somewhat. But what, I pray you? That Christian people were e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer so taught: which is false, that this doctrine is groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vpon Christs words, which is false also. For what one doctor affirmeth the presence according to the article? Harding saith the three Euangelists and Saint Paul: <hi>Ergo</hi> saith Sander, there is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> thirde vntrueth: for M. Iewel hath words plainely written &amp;c. But if these words prooue the presence according to the article, the controuersie should be at an ende.</p>
                  <p>The 4. vntruth is, that M. Iewell saith, Harding vpon the wordes of the institution, foundeth his carnall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence in such grosse sort, really, and fleshly in the
<pb n="704" facs="tcp:13044:362"/>
Sacrament. Sander replieth it is lesse carnall, grosse, and fleshly, to haue the substance of Christs corporall flesh, in a spirituall manner, really present vnder the forme of breade, then to bee in his mothers wombe, as Marcion, and Apelles counted it, or to make a lye, when he saide, take, eate, this &amp;c: As though the graunting of Christes humanitie, prooued the Popish presence, which is contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie to the truth of his humanitie, or that Christ might not say truely, the Sacrament to be his bodie, except it were after that manner, his bodie. His presence in spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall manner, we graunt, but we vnderstande spirituall manner, to bee otherwise then inuisiblie, for manie thinges may be so present, that they are not seene, and yet be not spiritually, but corporally present.</p>
                  <p>The fift vntrueth is, that M. Iewell saith: Christ vseth no leading to that carnall presence.</p>
                  <p>Sander answereth: The word This, leadeth the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles to that vnderstanding, as if I say, this is a Lyon, it will followe vnder this visible forme, that I shewe, a Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is substantially contained, &amp;c. As right as a rammes horne. If I shew a king or a strong man, I may say true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in some sense, This is a Lyon. For if I shew one sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, and affirme another of it, the speach must needes be either false, or figuratiue.</p>
                  <p>The sixt vntruth, and a forged lye is, that Master Iew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell saith, <hi>D. Fisher saith, this sense cannot in any wise be gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of the bare words of Christ.</hi> Fishers words, as Sander re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herseth them, are these: <hi>No man shall proue by the bare words of the Gospel, that any priest in these dayes, doth consecrate the true bodie and bloud of Christ.</hi> Againe. <hi>No worde is put whereby it may be prooued, that in our masse, the verie presence of Christs bodie and bloude is made.</hi> Iudge indifferentlie of the words, what lye Iewell hath forged. Although Fisher meant, that by the interpretation of the fathers, and practise of the Church, the vnderstanding of the Gospell is more certainely obtained: then by the bare words of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spell. But Fisher hath other wordes: <hi>Non potest igitur per illam scripturam probari, quòd aut laicus aut sacerdos quoties id negotij tentauerit, pari modo conficiet ex pane vinóque Christi
<pb n="705" facs="tcp:13044:362"/>

                        </gap>ud in scripturis contineatur:</hi> which M. Iewel beginneth to eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish thus, <hi>It cannot therefore be prooued by any scripture.</hi> Here Sander playeth the schoolemaster, and apposeth him. What cannot be proued M. Iewel? giue me the nomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue case to the verbe <hi>non potest,</hi> it cannot, saith Sander. What cannot? Wherevpon is grounded the 7. vntrueth, when Iewel saith: <hi>Doct. Fisher saith, the carnall presence can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be proued neither by these words</hi> (this is my bodie) <hi>nor by any other.</hi> But I put case Master Iewell woulde answere your deepe demaunde, in saying, that <hi>potest</hi> in this place, is a verbe impersonall, and therefore he can giue it no no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minatiue case at all, but must english it thus, <hi>non potest</hi> it cannot. If you will aske him, why he saith then the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall presence cannot bee prooued, as though presence were the nominatiue case: he will answere you, he doth not so construe, or translate the Latine, but he inferreth that conclusion, vpon Fishers wordes. <hi>No worde is put whereby it may be prooued, that in our Masse the verie presence of Christes bodie and bloude is made.</hi> But your learning, wil haue the whole speach following to bee the nomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue. I say, let it so bee, if you will needes haue it so, yet Master Iewels conclusion is true: That Fisher af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth the carnall presence cannot bee prooued to bee made, either by laye man or Priest: <hi>ergo</hi> it cannot bee prooued at all. Yet saith Sander, <hi>Howe manie enormous faults haue you committed heere, master Iewell? First Harding af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed these wordes,</hi> This is my bodie, <hi>to teach a reall presence: Fisher spake of these words,</hi> Make this thing, <hi>and not of these wordes,</hi> This is my bodie. This were an enormous fault, if Fisher had not saide, <hi>Non potest per vllam scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram probari,</hi> it cannot be prooued by any scripture: but seeing he saide so, this is an enormous, slanderous, impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, and foolish lye, and cauill of Sander. Secondly, Harding spake of the reall presence, if any sacrament bee made at al: Fisher, whether any man <hi>had autoritie to make anie Sacrament at all or no.</hi> When you can finde Hardings if, or condition, you shalbe answered to Fishers whether or question. Thirdly <hi>Harding spake of Christs words; Fisher
<pb n="706" facs="tcp:13044:363"/>
of our doings.</hi> If the scripture be not Christs words, Fisher spake onely of our doings. 4 <hi>Fisher doubted not but the wordes made the presence, but he asketh the heretikes howe they can proue it by the holy scriptures.</hi> Nay syr, he affirmeth pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisely, that it cannot be proued by the scripture. These are the foure great enormous fault. I trust after this tast, no man is desirous to examine the rest of Sanders vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truthes, falsely fathered vpon Master Iewel. Wherefore I wil goe from henceforth onely to the matter in contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersie. Hitherto you heare not Master Iewels article di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sproued. <hi>Videlicet,</hi> that the people were not taught, &amp;c. as in the beginning of the Chapter. The question, being not of the wordes, but of the meaning, saith Iewel, Christ meant not this to bee his bodie really. Hereto Sander alleageth a place of Hilarie: lib. 8. <hi>de Trin.</hi> to proue, that Christ lacked neither wisedome, nor vtterance, to speak plainely of his Sacraments, and mysteries: which is verie true, for hee spake plainely, syncerely, and truely, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he spake figuratiuely. Neither did hee speake o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise then he meant, seeing it is his bodie after a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine manner, as Augustine saith.</p>
                  <p>But seeing heere are three or foure persons speaking: M. Iewel, M. Harding, M. Sander, and my selfe: it shall not be amisse to bring their seuerall speaches in forme of a Dialogue for briefenesse, as Sander giueth me ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample.</p>

                     <p>This place of Tertullian is shamefully mang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led both in wordes and sense. Tertullian asketh. <q>But why did he call breade his body, and not rather a pepon which Marcion accounted in steed of an hart, not vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, that this was an auncient figure of the bodie of Christ, saying by Ieremie: Against me haue they thought a thought, saying: Come, let vs cast wood on his breade, that is, the crosse on his bodie. Therefore the lightener of antiquities, sufficiently declared what he would haue breade then to haue signified, when he calleth bread his body.</q> These words declare, wherefore Christ did appoint bread to signifie his bodie, in his supper: namely because it had bene an ancient figure of his body, in somuch that it was called bread. <hi>But he made bread his body, therefore it is not his body still.</hi> I aunswere, Tertullian sheweth how hee made it his body, when he expoundeth it by the name of the figure of his body. Baptisme being made regenerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is still a washing with water. The rocke when it was made Christ, remained still a rocke. &amp;c.</p>

doeth plainly proue it. For he answereth the obiection of them that denyed the resurrection of the fleshe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Angelike perfection, whereunto the children of the resurrection shalbe changed: shewing that the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection shall not bee through vertue of the fleshe, but through the incorruption which the flesh shall put on. Vsing a similitude of the flesh of Christ, which of it self doeth profite nothing, but by vertue of the spirit, which maketh it able to giue life. Wherefore the error of the Capernaits was, in that they imagined the substance of Christes flesh should be eaten bodily, which Tertullian affirmed should be eaten spiritually, and by faith of his worde onely. As for the authoritie of Lyra which follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth, is not worth the contention.</p>

                     <p>The thing of the Sacrament, is not the body of Christ sitting in heauen, but the company of Saints, and the vnitie of the bodie and bloud of Christ, not his natural bodie, but his mysticall bodie the church. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
<pb n="723" facs="tcp:13044:371"/>
he saith not simply: The Sacrament, but the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this thing, that is to say, of the body and bloud of Christ, which fiue words, M. Iewel hath left out.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Fulke.</speaker>
                     <p>These fiue words help you as much as fiue egges, whereof foure be rotten. For Augustine by them vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standeth the flesh &amp; bloud, which Christ promised to giue, which if it be not the same bodie which sitteth in heauen, that bodie which sitteth in heauen is not giuen (by his iudgement) in the Sacrament. For thus he wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth vpon these words of Christ, He that eateth my flesh, and drinketh my bloud, hath life euerlasting: <q>Therefore he hath not this life, which eateth not this bread nor drinketh this bloud. For temporall life men may haue without it, but eternall they cannot haue at all. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, he that eateth not his flesh, nor drinketh his bloud, hath not life in himselfe: and he that eateth his flesh &amp; drinketh his bloud, hath life eternall. And that he saith, euerlasting life, answereth to both: it is not so in this meate which we take for sustentation of the life of this bodie: for he which taketh it not, shall not liue: and yet he shall not liue which shall take it. For it may be, that by olde age or sickenesse, or some chance, many which shal take it, may die: but in-this meat &amp; drink, that is, in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bodie and bloud of our Lorde, it is not so, for both he which taketh it not, hath not life: &amp; he which taketh it, hath life, &amp; y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> verily eternal. Therefore he will haue this meat &amp; drink vnderstood to be y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fellowship of his body &amp; his members, which is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> holy church in his saints, and faithful ones predestinated &amp; called, &amp; iustified, &amp; glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied. Wherof y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> first is alreadie done, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is predestination, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> second &amp; third is both done &amp; is a doing, &amp; shalbe done, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> is, calling &amp; iustification: but y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fourth is now in hope, &amp; shalbe in deede, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is glorification. The Sacrament of this thing, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is, of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vnitie of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> body &amp; bloud of Christ, in some places daily, in some places by certeine distance of dayes, is prepared in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lords table, to some vnto life, to some vnto destruction. But the thing it self, wherof also it is a Sacrament, is to euery man vnto life, to no man vnto destruction, whosoeuer shalbe partaker of it.</q>

You haue therefore gained thus much by your ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uilling: that neither the flesh and bloud of Christ, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised in the sixt of Iohn, nor the thing of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is the bodie of Christ which sitteth in heauen, but the participation of his mysticall bodie, and the fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship or communion of his bodie, and the members ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, which is the assurance of eternall life. But where you saye, the Sacrament is that naturall body of Christ which sitteth in heauen, you saye beside your booke: for neither Augustine, nor any ancient father did euer say, that the Sacrament of the bodie of Christ was the body of Christ, otherwise then after a certeine manner of speaking, as Augustine saith.</p>

Verily, on the son<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day it selfe, we SAIE this day our Lorde arose againe, notwithstanding there are so many yeres since he arose. Why, is no man so foolish to reproue vs so SPEAKING as if wee had lyed? but because wee CALL these dayes according to the similitude of the dayes, in which those thinges were done, that it is SAIDE, the day it selfe, which is not the day it selfe, but in reuolution of time like it: that it is SAIDE to be done on y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> daye, because of the celebration of the sacrament (or mysterie) which was not done that day, but long before. Was not Christ once offered in himselfe, and yet in a sacrament? not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at euerie solemnitie of Easter, but euerie day he is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered for the people. Neither surely doth he lie, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing demanded, shall answere, that he is offered.

                     <p>For the same cause S. Augustine saith: In Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments we must consider not what they be, but what they represent. For they are tokens of things, being one thing, and signifying another.</p>

                     <p>As they be tokens, they be one thing, &amp; si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnifie another: and therefore the substance of Christes bodie, is not his death or passion, or the vnitie of his Church, which thing vnder the forme of bread it doeth signifie, but it is another manner of thing, to wit, a bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die immortal, impassible, &amp;c.</p>

                     <p>This is that Eusebius writeth, that the bodie might be worshipped by a mysterie, &amp; that euerlasting sacrifice should liue in remembrance, and be present in grace for euer: in this spirituall sort, &amp; not fleshly, Christ is laide present vpon the altar.</p>

                     <p>He remoueth not the natural office of the body from eating the Sacrament, but from eating the natural body of Christ. And most horrible is the impudence of Master Sander, which dissembleth that S. Augustine in the place by him cited, speaketh of figuratiue sayings <hi>contra aduers. leg. &amp; proph. lib. 2. Cap.</hi> 9. Immediatly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the words by him rehearsed, comparing our eating of Christes fleshe, with Christ beeing one flesh with his Church, and immediatly after the wordes aforesaied concluding that figuratiue sayinges must not bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned. <q>

                     <p>Said he not before, it was a figuratiue speach, to eate the flesh of Christ, and to drinke his bloud? and is it then a great merueile, if the Sacrament be called by the name of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> thing whereof it is a Sacrament?

I thinke there is no cobler in Cambridge or Oxforde, but he could winde himselfe out of this fallacia. To dwell in all men by participation of common nature, is one thing, and one whole bodie, to be whole in tenne thousand places, is another thing.</p>

Againe, the argument is nought, hee tooke bread of idolaters generally for all meates by synecdoche the figure: Therefore hee taketh the bread of Christians specially for one kinde of meate, which is no bread at all.</p>

                     <p>Against the Arrians, Hilarius reasoned thus, Christ is really ioined vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> father, as vnto vs, but Christ is ioyned to vs by nature, therefore Christ is ioyned to God the father by nature. That Christ is ioyned to vs by nature, he proueth it thus: We are ioyned to Christ by faith, that is by the nature of one faith, and that is to say, naturally.</p>

                     <p>You slander him most impudently, for he doth expounde the wordes of Hilarie, <hi>Per vnius fidei naturam,</hi> by the nature of one faith, to be all one, as if he had said, naturally.</p>

                     <speaker>Sand.</speaker>
                     <p>S. Hilaries intent, is onely to shewe that faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full men are one among themselues by nature of faith, and not how Christ is ioyned to vs by that faith, which he hath not at al, for he answereth the argument of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded vpon that place, Act. 4. of the multitude of the beleeuers, there was one soule and one heart.</p>

                     <p>As though there coulde bee anye vnitie of the belieuers among themselues, but as they are al ioyned in one by Christ, &amp; Christ to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> blasphemously San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der affirmeth to haue had no faith fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the instant of his incarnation, because his soule was illuminated with the visio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of God, to whose nature it was ioyned in one person
<pb n="765" facs="tcp:13044:392"/>
and where cleare vision is, there is no faith saith Sander. Not considering, that Christ did voluntarily, empty him selfe, of all such pretogatiues of his godheade, as might hinder him to haue experience of all our infirmities, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept sinne. And therfore S. Luke testifieth y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Iesus incresed in wisedom, and stature, and fauour with God &amp; men. But where such cleare vision is, as Sand. imagineth, there is no increase of wisdome &amp; gods gifts. And concerning faith: read y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 22. Psal. which is a prophecie of Christ, professing his constant faith, in so much that he was therefore deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of the wicked, which saide, he trusted in God, let him deliuer him &amp;c. Yea the Apostle to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Hebrewes proueth the humanitie of Christ, by this Psal. 16. (where the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet speaketh in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> person of Christ) I wil put my trust in him, that is in God: yet Sander saith, he neuer had faith, but more then faith. As though a greater &amp; a more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect faith were not faith.</p>

                     <speaker>Sand.</speaker>
                     <p>S. Hilarie hath not the terme naturally, of our coniunction vnto Christ by baptisme, which terme D. Harding hath found to appertaine to the sacrament.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Fulke.</speaker>
                     <p>A simple quarel, to make such outcries of the terme naturally, when Hilarie hath termes in all reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable mens iudgements, equiualent, concluding that all Christians are one, not onely by wil, but also by nature, Because they are cloathed with one Christ, by the nature of one baptisme. And where I pray you, hath either Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding or you found y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Christs body is in y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> sacrament na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally, according to M. Iewels challenge? wil you neuer leaue this beggerly sophistrie? Harding hath found this terme to appertaine to the sacrament: <hi>ergo</hi> he hath answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red M.

                     <p>Thus it appeareth by S. Hilarie, we may haue Christ naturally within vs, by three other sundrie meanes: and therfore not onely (as M. Harding holdeth) by receiuing of the sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, Like as Christ is naturally

                     <p>The aduerbe verily in this place doth signifie naturally, really, and substantially. For as the worde is made flesh really, so we take really the word being flesh in our Lords meate. The worde was not made flesh one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by our faith, but in trueth of his substance. Therefore we take the word being flesh not by our faith onely, but in trueth of his substance.</p>

                     <p>The aduerbe verily in this place, signifieth truly, according to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> thing, but not that according to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the thing, in al points wee take the flesh of Christ in the Lordes meate, as the same was incarnate in the Virgins wombe, but as Hilarie himselfe saith afterwarde: <hi>Verè sub mysterio,</hi> We receiue the flesh of his bodie truly, vnder a mysterie, which excludeth naturally, or a natural manner of receiuing. We eate Christ as truely, as he was made man, &amp; borne of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Virgin Mary, but not in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same manner: we eate him not sensibly, visibly, palpablie, in length, bredth, and thicknesse as hee was made fleshe,
<pb n="768" facs="tcp:13044:394"/>
but vnder a mysterie or sacrament of his flesh, which is communicated vnto vs after a spirituall manner. And where you say the worde was not made flesh, onely by our faith, therefore we take his flesh not by faith onely. Neither is the antecedent true, nor the conclusion right. For Christ was not made flesh onely by our faith, nor by our faith at all. For our faith was no meane of his incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. Where vpon I might as rightly conclude: The word was not made flesh by our faith at all: therefore we take not the worde being made flesh by faith at all. This argument is as good vpon the aduerbe verily, vsed by S. Hilarie, as that which you make.</p>

                     <p>And is the reall flesh of Christ mingled with his diuinitie? what can followe thereof, but confusion of the natures? If that be hereticall, then the nature of his flesh mingled with the nature of his euerlastingnesse, is not his reall flesh, nor his reall diuinitie, but the natural propertie, as he termeth it afterward, of his diuine flesh, which is communicated vnto vs vnder a sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t.

                     <p>In deede M. Iewel, Christ deliuered his fleshe as well at Capernaum, as at his supper by your doctrine. But not so by the doctrine of the Gospel.</p>

For many of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> might die before y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> institution of his supper. Againe he saith, <gap reason="foreign">

A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, He which doth eate my fleshe, and which doth drinke my bloude, doeth abide in mee, and I in him. How can this be verified in the present temps, so ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peted, except Christ did at that present time deliuer his fleshe and bloude to bee eaten of all that beleeued and offered the same to all that heard him? wherefore the doctrine of the Gospel, is agreable to that which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster Iewel teacheth, and directlye contrarie to master Sanders doctrine, that Christ deliuered not his flesh and blood to be eaten &amp; dronken before his supper, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly promised them at Capernaum.</p>
