            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Recieved the Letter you ſent me concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Caſe of your Aſtmahtical Patient, who tells you that he is troubled with a Stop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>page in his Stomach, or the Riſing of the Lights, as he calls it; both you and I know very well
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:44432:3"/>
what he means; and the beſt Advice I can give you in that Caſe is to bleed him plentifully, and give him inwardly the <hi>Blatta Bizantina,</hi> which I know to be an incomparable Speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick to give him Breath, to remove the ſpas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modical Affections of the Lungs and Stomach, to promote the Circulation of the Blood, and to prevent a <hi>Pollipus</hi> from growing in the Heart, which oftner cauſeth ſudden Death than the World imagins; for when the whole Maſs of Blood in a Mans Body, which ſhould run through the Heart and Lungs ten or twelve time in an hour, is ſtopt in its Circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, and creeps through as it were by Drops, and for want of Motion ſtagnates and putri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies, it may well cauſe Pains and Stoppages in the Breaſt, and Shortneſs of Breath.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Shell-fiſh</hi> is the ſame which in <hi>Exodus</hi> is called by <hi>Moſes Onicha,</hi> one of the Ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients of the Holy Perfume preſcribed by Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God himſelf. I am ſure it hath done great Service, in relieving many who have had great ſtoppages in their Stomachs, and difficult Breathing, which hath made them very appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive of ſome ſudden Change.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:44432:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
I confeſs I have known many dye of this Diſtemper with ſhort warning, and eſpecially Miniſters, and ſome Lawyers, after they have ſpent their Spirits with much ſpeaking; and particularly I know a very Grave and Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Divine, who after his Preaching uſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to drink two Glaſſes of <hi>Sack,</hi> which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious Cuſtom heated his Lungs after they had been too much warmed before by Earn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt and loud ſpeaking, this Perſon had gotten an ill Habit of Body, and a violent <hi>Aſtmah,</hi> but was very much relieved by Drinking only warm Ale, with a few Drops drawn out of this Medicine, with a little Nutmeg and Sugar, which he made his conſtant Practice, and found much. Advantage by it, leſs Pain in his Breaſt, a more free Reſpiration, and a clear Voice in Preaching. I only once in a Month adviſed him to take a little <hi>Manna</hi> in <hi>Water-Gruel,</hi> to carry down the Phlegm, and keep his Body laxative.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Grant</hi> in his Obſervations upon the Bills of Mortality takes Notice that this Diſeaſe is much encreaſed of late Years; in 1629. there
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:44432:4"/>
was but forty four, but in 1660. there was two hundred and forty nine. And he tells us, that the Cauſe proceeds from the Lungs, which are the Bellows of the Body, not blow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that is, neither recieving in nor venting out Breath.</p>
            <p>But a Greater Man than Mr. <hi>Grant</hi> ſaith, it proceeds from an abundance of Morbifick Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in the Blood, and Nervous Liquor, which cauſeth a Convulſion in the Lungs; and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it may proceed from a Decay of the vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latile Salts of the Blood, which makes it apt to fix and ſtagnate in the Breaſt.</p>
            <p>But I ſhall not meddle with the Speculative Part of Phyſick, but only the Practical, which is Grounded upon Experience; for as Dr. <hi>Caſtle</hi> well obſerves, that Experienced Medicines are like Dials and Almanacks, which agree as well with the <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> of <hi>Copernicus</hi> as of <hi>Ptolemy.</hi> The Husbandman may till his Land, and ſow his Seed, and yet not fully underſtand whether the Earth or Sun moves.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:44432:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <hi>Hypocrates,</hi> the Father of Phyſitians, adviſeth his Sons not to be backward in making Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations upon the Cures wrought by Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riers or ignorant Women, though they were not able to give an Account how or in what manner they Cured.</p>
            <p>I lately had an Aſtmahtical Patient, whoſe Breath ſeemed to be gone every moment, and all his Blood would appear in his Face, as if he were ſtrangled, and yet upon taking this Medicine he was wonderfully relieved, and walked abroad. I alſo adviſed him to Bleed, and play at Bowls often.</p>
            <p>A Gentlewoman about fifty Years of Age complained to me of a great Oppreſſion and ſtoppage at her Stomach, had taken many Purges and Vomits, but all in vain; I gave her the Tincture drawn out of theſe Shells, mixed with the Extract and Spirit of the ſame; ſhe took it every morning in a glaſs of Spring-Water, mixed with Virgins Honey. I permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted her to eat no Suppers but ſtewed Prunes or Roaſted Pippins, and ſhe wonderfully recovered.</p>

A middle aged Man of a ſedentary Life told me, he could not lye down in his Bed for fear of being choaked, his Stoppage and Wheaſing in his Throat were ſo troubleſome. I uſed only this Remedy, it gave him Help and Eaſe. I could mention many others, but I'le Deſiſt.</p>
