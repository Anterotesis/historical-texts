         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO
THOMAS BARNARDISTON, <abbr>Eſq</abbr>
OF
Ketton in Suffolk.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>AFter a Poet has made his appearance upon the
Stage, the next thing he generally does, is to
take his ſtation in ſome great man's Anti-chamber;
there to ſcrew himſelf into a protection for his Play,
with a Paper ſtufft full of Bombaſt-encomiums of
his new Patrons high Merits and wonderful Qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations:
Which perhaps, till that time, were as little
heard of in the world, as the Poet was known to his
thus applauded <hi>Maecenas.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The buſineſs of this Dedication to you, Sir, is
quite otherwiſe; for as I have the honour to be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
well known to You, ſo I take this opportunity,
as well to expreſs the ſentiments of my eſteem for
You, as to publiſh my thanks for paſt Obligations.
A poor Tribute indeed! But as 'tis my preſent All,
ſo it's wholly at your ſervice.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:48675:3"/>
And now, while I am paying my Addreſſes to a
<hi>Barnardiſton,</hi> methinks I have as copious a ſubject to
enlarge upon as I cou'd wiſh. But leſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I ſhou'd ſeem
to incur the reflection I have thought fit to make
on others, I ſhall only hint at what I cou'd not poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly
omit. I ſhou'd exaſperate the Country You
live in, ſhou'd I not take notice with what a due
regard they have all ſixt their Eyes upon You. Nor
is there any queſtion to be made, but that in this
their well-grounded hopes, You will even out-do
their Expectations. And tho <hi>Lincolnſhire</hi> as well as
<hi>Suffolk</hi> claims an Intereſt in You, yet the latter has
that to ſay of your Family, which can ſcarce be pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallell'd
in any other.</p>
            <p>That <hi>Ketton</hi> ſhou'd have been the continued Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion-houſe
of ſeven and twenty Sir <hi>Thomas Barnar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſtons,</hi>
ſucceſſively from Father to Son, with but the
interruption of one Sir <hi>Nathaniel,</hi> Your great Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father,
is a thing highly remarkable. And ſince the
Honour of Baronet is but of late date in the world,
no doubt but that badge of Knighthood was ſtill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd
upon theſe brave Anceſtors of Yours for their
fidelity to the Crown<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and as a reward for the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices
they ſeverally afforded their reſpective Princes.
This noble train of Sir <hi>Thomas</hi>'s is at preſent clos'd with
the now Sir <hi>Thomas Barnardiſton,</hi> your truly honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Father, a perſon every way ſo conſpicuous, that
he has no occaſion for the leaſt touch of a Poet's
varniſh, to gloſs over his true and real worth. All
that I ſhall ſay upon this account is, that being ſo
<pb facs="tcp:48675:3"/>
well acquainted with that tender Union and Correſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondence
that is betwixt you, I may ſafely anſwer
for your joyning with me in an
<q>O <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>tinam ſero in Coelum Redeat!</q>
After this may your Lineage run the length of
time; and may <hi>Ketton</hi> never want a <hi>Barnardiſton</hi> for
its Proprietor, till the world wants a Mortal for its
Inhabitant.</p>
            <p>Thus, Sir, as I began my Epiſtle in a method ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
uncuſtomary for one of my profeſſion; and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
all along forborn to harangue you with fulſome
Flattery, ſo I ſhall beg leave to conclude without ſo
much as ſide glancing a ſingle Compliment upon
my ſelf, and let me tell you, that's a great piece of ſelf-denyal
in a Poet of this Age. I am confident, that
as you wou'd be apt to ſcorn me for the one, ſo
you'd laugh at me for the other. If I can find out
any value to put upon my ſelf, 'tis not in reſpect of
my performances, but for the good fortune I
have to be,</p>
            <closer>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
