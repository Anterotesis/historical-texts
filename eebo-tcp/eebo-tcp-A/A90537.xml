            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Two things therfore wee pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound:
<list>
                     <item>I. That the <hi>End</hi> bee Chriſtian and Noble.</item>
                     <item>II. That the <hi>means</hi> bee adequate.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p n="1">I. For the <hi>End,</hi> it is generally agreed, that it ſhould bee <hi>the preparing and ſitting younger people for ſom ſervice, in reference to their Countries;</hi> not for ſtudying to determine in ſtudying; eſpecially in tendencie to ſpiritual or civil good; commonly called <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrie,</hi> and <hi>Magiſtracie:</hi> with which terms I know not why anie ſhould quarrel.</p>
               <p n="2">

II. Then the <hi>Means</hi> need to lead that way, and to bee ſuitable and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, if poſſible. For preſent this is offred; <hi>viz.</hi> That ſuppoſing there bee ſixteen ſuch Houſes in <hi>Cambridg,</hi> eight may bee laid apart wholly, and onely for thoſe intended for the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtrie: To carrie this on</p>
               <p n="1">1. That, as the Jeſuits for wits, ſo wee, for godlineſs, chuſe all ſuch youth in anie place, or condition where wee finde them at plough or trade, which are godlie and tractable, and ſend them thither to ſtudie Logick, and tongues, and ſuch to have their maintenance there out of Scholar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips, &amp;c.</p>

               <p n="4">4. And having ſuch materials, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie College may have in it a Church of Chriſt; and ſo eight Churches; and more may bee in the Town, which may ſpread over all the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

<pb n="8" facs="tcp:115408:10"/>
hence with ſubmiſſion it is offred, that Tutors would let them know what parts of man they muſt deal withal in preaching, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>

               </list>
               <p>And therefore they do well, that in their preaching, and publick read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Scripture, Firſt analize the chapter; Secondly, cleer all difficulties in it where ever it lie's; and thirdly, draw ſom concluſions from the <hi>analy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis,</hi> which muſt needs bee the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row of the Scripture. Wee are bold to conclude, theſe three things will make a good Preacher in reference to means (the help of the ſpirit ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed)<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                  <pb n="9" facs="tcp:115408:10"/>
1. Sound Judgment in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; which muſt bee got by prayer and dailie reading.

               <p n="2">2.

               <p n="3">3. Dexteritie in caſe of Conſcience: in which particular the miſerie of this nation ought to bee bewailed, who were wont to bee fruitful in caſes. <hi>Perkins</hi> and <hi>Ames</hi> have don a little that way, but not much. What want of converting Preachers there is, who ſee's not? and that high opinion of
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:115408:11"/>
illiterate men's doing ſo much good is a miſtake, if generally obſerved.</p>
               <p>And when they are thus fitted, they may bee ſent out when there is need, and mainteined by the College<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtock, till provided for in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, where they may gather Churches in the Countie.

               <p>Their maintenance may bee of tithes, or rather from ſomthing an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable at two ſhillings, one ſhilling, or eighteen pence upon a pound-rent: which ſtock may bee put into three gentlemen's hands, choſen yearly for that purpoſe, and thence allow to theſe Preachers, according to their places, conditions, and families: and out of
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:115408:11"/>
this ſtock thirtie pound <hi>per annum</hi> to the widow, during widowhood, when anie die's; out of this ſtock the poor may have help; yea good ſummes may bee borrowed by the State in anie exigent upon good ſecuritie.</p>
               <p>And thus the State paie's them, and thus they have dependance upon the State.</p>
               <p>Two of the ableſt of theſe, may one day in a week, at the Countie-Town, anſwer all controverſies, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to a Rule after preſcribed.</p>
               <p>And for the other eight Colleges, they may have in each ſix Tutors, to whom, all Gentlemen that would learn anie other Arts or Science whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever may reſort, and there may you have whatever anie out-Landiſh Aca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demie can teach: from thence, if anie will applie themſelves to the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrie, they may com to the other Colleges.</p>

               <p>To all this I would add, that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie of your Gentrie, Lawyers, and Phyſitians might do well to applie themſelves, beeing godlie, and quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, as manie are.</p>
               <p>Or why might not ſom of the nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous Gentrie in their Countrey, ſtudie, and either preach for nothing; or give Phyſick <hi>gratis,</hi> or adviſe in matters of Law freely?</p>
               <p>The ſins of <hi>Sodom</hi> creep upon us: and whileſt our Souldiers are whetting their ſwords for the next battel, how manie are whetting their knives for the next feaſt? oh! why ſhould anie make Recreation a trade?</p>
