            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <l>
                     <pb facs="tcp:3448:34"/>When the sad plot fills it with murdred Trunckes,</l>
                  <l>And none are left aliue but onely one,</l>
                  <l>To aske the kinde spectators (<hi>plaudite</hi>)</l>
                  <l>All else haue bid (<hi>valete</hi>) to the world,</l>
                  <l>The man reseru'd for that, is <hi>Tyndarus,</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>Who thus hath seen his childrens childrens end,</l>
                  <l>His Grandchild, a bad sonne, a most deare friend;</l>
                  <l>The Scene must now be ouerflow'd with grones,</l>
                  <l>Each man sits downe to waile his priuate mones:</l>
                  <l>One for the Queen doth weep, one for the King,</l>
                  <l>All taste the bitter waters of this Spring:</l>
                  <l>The Nurse bewails the child, that part she beares,</l>
                  <l>All haue their subiects to bedew with teares;</l>
                  <l>Each one yet haue but one; but all of mee,</l>
                  <l>Challenge a part in griefes sad sympathy.</l>
                  <l>
                     <hi>Orestes, Clytemnstra,</hi> I must call,</l>
                  <l>These all for mine, thus must I weepe for all:</l>
                  <l>Let none belieue this deed, or if they doe.</l>
                  <l>Let them belieue this punishment then too.</l>
                  <l>'Tis vile to hate a Father, but such loue,</l>
                  <l>As breeds a hate to'th mother, worse doth proue:</l>
                  <l>Our life consists of ayre, our state of winde,</l>
                  <l>All things we leaue behind vs which wee find,</l>
                  <l>Sauing our faults; witnesse <hi>Orestes</hi> here,</l>
                  <l>VVho was his owne tormentor, his owne feare.</l>
                  <l>VVho flying all, yet could not fly him selfe,</l>
                  <l>But needs must shipwrack vpon murders shelfe:</l>
                  <l>And so his brest made hard with miserie,</l>
                  <l>He grew himselfe to be his enemy.</l>
                  <l>Thus griefe and gladnesse still by turnes do come,</l>
                  <l>But pleasure leastwhile doth possesse the roome.</l>
                  <l>Long nights of griefe may last, but lo, one day</l>
                  <l>Of shining comfort slideth soone away.</l>
                  <l>He, whom all feare on earth, must feare a fate,</l>
                  <l>For all our powers are subordinate:</l>
                  <l>Three howres space thus well can represent,</l>
                  <l>Vices contriu'd and murders punishment.</l>
                  <l>A Monarchs life can in this little space</l>
                  <l>Shew all the pompe that all the time doth grace</l>
                  <l>His risings and his falls, and in one span</l>
                  <l>
                     <pb facs="tcp:3448:34"/>Of time, can shew the vanity of man.</l>
                  <l>For none of vs can so command the powers</l>
                  <l>That we may say, to morrow shall be ours.</l>
                  <l>Now Fortunes wheele is turn'd, and time doth call,</l>
                  <l>To solemnize this friendly funerall.</l>
                  <l>No force so great, no so disaster wrong,</l>
                  <l>As can vnknit the bands which holdeth strong</l>
                  <l>Vnited hearts: who since they thus are dead,</l>
                  <l>One roome, one tombe shall hold them buried:</l>
                  <l>And as these friends ioyn'd hands to beare their Fate;</l>
                  <l>So we desire you to imitate.</l>
                  <l>VVho since they all are dead, we needs must craue</l>
                  <l>Your gentle hands to bring them to their graue.</l>
