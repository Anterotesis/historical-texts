            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">P</seg>Eradventure ſome will ſay this Labour is
ſuperfluous this work is already in
proſe, what need this verſe come lim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
after; Indeed I confeſſe all is but
one diſh of meat ſeverally dreſt; yet we oft ſee one
baked and another roſt of the ſame kind (rightly
ſauced and ſeaſoned) is more acceptable then a third
of a contrary kind which is not ſo good in quality:
If here be any thing praiſe-worthy it belongs to
<hi>Herodian</hi> that Famous Greek Hiſtorian, who was
the Author; as touching the Tranſlator I ſuppoſe he
did it for his recreation, and for ought I can perceive
doth not much care whether you give him thanks
or no, becauſe he hath not told his name: for my part
that have put it into Rime, if I could, it ſhould have
been verſe; for I doe Ingenuouſly confeſſe my ſelfe
much obliged to the Hiſtory, ſeeing ſo many mighty
Monarchs and high Eſtates one while at the top of
Fortunes wheele, and anon turned topſy turvy, or cut
off by an untimely death, hath made me the better
able to digeſt my owne misfortunes; I therefore
thought it better thus harmleſsly to ſpend my va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant
houres, whether any one give me thanks or no,
then to trouble my braines with former loſſes,
when neither they or I was guilty thereof: robd and
undone I was by the rebellion in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and I part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
know what ſet them awork, yet leave the revenge
to God, Aſcribing unto him all Honour and humble
Thanks for my preſent Affliction and miraculous
Preſervation, which I have formerly ſhewed elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where:
but of one thing I aſſure you, if I had part of
<pb facs="tcp:52306:3"/>
my Lands and goods againe, I ſhould imploy my
ſelfe (by honeſt induſtry) to improve them (as
formerly I did) and not in making verſes; for I am
now too ſenſible of that old adage, there goes but a
paire of ſheers betwixt a Poet and a begger.</p>
            <p>To ſay any thing in excuſe of Tranſlations I
think it needleſſe to good and generous natures, and
to the other, with Courtly Sir <hi>Io: Harrington</hi> (to one
that ſaid of his excellent Poem it was but a tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation)
I ſay I will give one but for another as he
did in one of his Epigrams: yet of your clemency I
deſire you to excuſe the plainneſſe of my Rimes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
I have been by profeſſion a piece of a Souldier
and not a Scholler. If the matter be not delivered
faithfully, it would be an invention rather then a
Tranſlation, therefore whoever will pleaſe to try
one Canto, if he hit the ſenſe and keep the words
better, the ſubmiſſion is already made: and if any
marvell to ſee ſome Stanza's of eight lines now and
then intermixt, the beſt reaſon I can give you is,
that where a ſentence could not well be comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
in ſix, I let it run on to eight for the more em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaticall
expreſſion as the matter required; if you
will have another reaſon, I allude to a Cardinall
that uſed to ſay I and my King. So I ſay it ſeemed
good to me &amp; my Muſe, as willing to give you ſome
Novelty which you and I obſerve dayly either for
better or worſe: ſome nice pallats (of late) would
not have a verſe to end with many ſyllables, ſome
others ſay it is to find fault with a fat Gooſe; it is
enough for me to ſay that Sir <hi>Phillip Sidney</hi> and
Sir <hi>Iohn Harrington</hi> both uſed and affected it. Some
alſo doe indeavour hands to uſher in their Poems
which I doe not think mine worthy of, neither
indeed doe I affect it, or elſe it is poſſible it might
have been done: if the Wine be good it needs no
buſh, I care not for a gaudy ſigne-poſt it often
deludes the Expectation. Laſtly, I deſire two
things of the courteous Reader, one is to mend
<pb facs="tcp:52306:3"/>
the faults of the Preſſe; the other, that he will
pleaſe to remember what is before mentioned tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
this Authors long and unjuſt exile out of his
Country, with great charge of Family, through
many Imminent dangers and grievous ſufferings:
This if he Candidly conſider he will leſſe marvell
why theſe Bookes are not publickly ſold, but only
preſented to ſuch Generous hands as are in
their goodneſſe ſenſible of this
Authors misfortune.</p>

was ſtrewed with filings of Gold and Silver. His <hi>Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels,</hi>
even of baſeſt uſe, were of Obryze Gold. His
<hi>Lamps</hi> burned with pretious Balmes and Gums of India
and Arabia. His <hi>Fiſh-ponds</hi> were filled with Roſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>water.
His <hi>Ships</hi> in his Theatricall Sea fights, floa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

Gold; but never ſerved twice to his Table. His <hi>Rings</hi>

His <hi>Concubines</hi> numberleſſe, but never laine with
twice. Every <hi>Supper</hi> in his Court coſt 1000
pounds ſterling. When he lay neere to the Sea, he would
eat no fiſh: when he was fartheſt in the Continent, he

Tongues of ſinging Birds, and Braines of rareſt Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.
