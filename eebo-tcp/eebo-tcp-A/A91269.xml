            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<hi>Anno 1502. p.</hi> 309, 310, 330, 331. England is
the main chance of Chriſtendome at this preſent, by ſeditions,
factions, tampering and aſpiring Heads: the onely But, Mark,
White, the Jeſuites aim at, as well in intention as execution of
their pretended expedition, exploit and action. I am of opinion,
that no man on earth can tell what Government it is they intend
to establiſh, ratifie and confirm, when they come to their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceited
Monarchy; no not any of their Plot-caſters. No
question it is, but their Government ſall be as uncertain as
their New-conceited Monarchy; their Monarchy as mutable as
their Reign, and their Reign as variable as the winde, or
Proteus in his Complements. But no question is to be made
of it, but that the Government they do directly intend at this
preſent, is <hi>A MOST ABSOLUTE SOVERAIGNTY,
DOMINION AND STATE, CLEARLY EXEMPTED</hi>
from any Subordination, <hi>TO ANY LAW</hi> or Legifer divine
or humane; and therefore it is rightly called <hi>DESPOTI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CON</hi>
in the higheſt degree of exemplary immunity, <hi>IMPE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RIALITY
AND ABSOLUTE REIGN, RULE AND
AUTHORITY,</hi> as convaining in it three ſorts of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;

For there ſhall be neither Title, nor Name,

was confident <hi>it would be,</hi> though he ſhould not live
to ſee it) written at <hi>Sevil</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> Anno Dom. 1590.
that they intended to have <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> with our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Fundamental Laws and Liberties, abrogated and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed:
thus expreſſed by <hi>William Watſon</hi> in his <hi>Quodlibets,</hi>
p. 92, 94, 95. <hi>Father Parſons and the Jeſuites in their deep
Jeſuitical Court of Parliament, begun at Styx in Phlegeton,
have compiled their Acts in a compleat Volume, intituled:</hi>
THE HIGH COURT OF REFORMATION FOR
ENGLAND.<note n="o" place="margin">Quere whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the HIGH COURT of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, had not it's Title from hence?</note> 
               <hi>And to give you a taſte of their intent by that
baſe Court OF A TRIBE OF TRAYTORS ſawcily (like
to Cade, Jack Straw, and Tom Tiler) USURPING THE
AUTHORITY OF BOTH STATES, ECCLESIASTI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CAL
AND TEMPORAL IN ALL THEIR REBEL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LIOUS
ENTERPRISES: theſe were principal points diſcuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,

And then proceeds thus to the fourth. <hi>The Fouth Statute
was there made concerning THE COMMON LAWS OF

That, ALL THE GREAT CHARTERS OF ENG<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LAND
MUST BE BURNT; the maner of holding Lands
in Fee-ſimple, Fee-tail, Kings Service, Soccage or Villanage,
brought into villany, ſcoggery and popularity, and in few, THE

being but baſe, barbarous, and void of all ſence, knowledge, or

SEMI-DIVINE, AND OF MORE

he thus ſeconds, <hi>Quodlibet 9. Artic. 2. p. 286. Firſt it is
plain, that Father Parſons and his Company (divide it amongſt
them how they liſt)</hi> HAVE LAID A PLOT, <hi>as being
moſt conſonant and fitting for their other Deſignments,</hi> THAT
THE COMMON LAWS OF THE REALM OF

brevity acquaint you onely with one, diſcovering what
ſwarms are now amongſt us, under other diſguiſes. An
Engliſh Proteſtant Nobleman (a perſon of honour) whoſe
Anceſtors were Papiſts, being courteouſly entertained
within theſe two yeers in the Jeſuites chief Colledge
at Rome by ſome eminent <hi>Jeſuites,</hi> was brought by them
into a Gallery having Chambers round about it, with
Titles written over every door for ſeveral Kingdoms and
Provinces, and amongſt the reſt, one for <hi>ENGLAND.</hi>
Upon which, he enquiring of the Jeſuites <hi>what theſe titles
ſignified;</hi> was anſwered by them, <hi>That they were the Chambers
of the Provincial Jeſuites, of each kingdom and Province (writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
over the reſpective doors) wherein they had any members
and Emiſſaries of their ſociety now reſiding, who received all
Letters of intelligence from their Agents in thoſe places every
week, and gave account of them to the General of their Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.
That the Provincial for</hi> England, <hi>lodged in the Chamber
over which the title</hi> ENGLAND <hi>was written, who could
ſhew him the laſt news from</hi> England <hi>if he deſired to ſee it.</hi>
Upon which they <hi>knocked at the door, which was preſently
opened:</hi> the Provincial <hi>being informed who and what he
was,</hi> read <hi>the laſt news from</hi> England <hi>to them.</hi> Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
the Nobleman demanded of them, <hi>Whether any of
their ſociety were now in</hi> England? <hi>how they could ſtay there with
<pb facs="tcp:115477:14"/>
ſafety, or ſupport themſelves,</hi> ſeeing <hi>moſt of the Engliſh Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
Gentry, and Families that were Papiſts, were ruined in
their ſtates, or ſequeſtred by the late wars and troubles, ſo as
they could neither harbour, conceal or maintain them, as they
had done heretofore?</hi> They anſwered, <hi>It was true; but the
greater the dangers and difficulties of thoſe of their ſociety now
in</hi> England <hi>were, the greater was their merit. And, that</hi>
THEY HAD THEN ABOVE FIFTEEN HUNDRED
OF THEIR SOCIETY IN ENGLAND,<note place="margin">Nota.</note> ABLE TO
WORK IN SEVERAL PROFESSIONS AND
TRADES, which they HAD THERE TAKEN UPON
THEM, THE BETTER TO SUPPORT AND SE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CURE
THEMSELVES FROM BEING DISCO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VERED.
This Relation I have heard from the mouth
of a Reverend Divine more then once; to whom this No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

all the world wondred after the Beaſt, and worſhipped</hi> not

<hi>ſaying, Who is like unto the Beaſt? WHO IS ABLE
TO MAKE WAR WITH HIM? And there was given
unto him a Mouth ſpeaking Great things and blaſphemies, and
power was given him to continue and make war forty and two
months. And power was given unto him to make war with
the SAINTS, AND TO OVERCOME THEM; and
power was given him over all Kindreds, and Tongues, and
Nations, And</hi> (HEREUPON IT FOLLOWS) <hi>all that
dwell upon the earth ſhall worſhip him, whoſe names are not

him) <hi>cauſed the earth and all that dwell therein to ſet up
the Image of this Beaſt, and to worſhip it; and he cauſed all
both ſmall and great, rich and poor, free and bond to receive

and none might buy or ſell, but he that had this mark;

to be killed.</hi> Yet this <hi>Blaſphemous Beaſts reign and

<hi>Beaſt,</hi> (in the height of his Power and Victories) was by
God himſelf, <hi>threatned to go into captivity, and be killed with
the Sword,</hi> as he had <hi>led others into captivity, and killed them

Souldiers their ſaddeſt meditations.</p>
            <p>1. That God may, nay oft-times doth give great power
to the very worſt and moſt blaſphemous of all Men and
Beaſts; &amp; that not only over one or two, but many <hi>Tongues
Nations,</hi> as in this Text, and <hi>Dan. 7. 3, to 29. c. 8. 4. to</hi> 27.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>That ſuch</hi> Beaſts <hi>many times may and do not onely
make war with, but even</hi> overcome the very Saints themſelves
in battel, <hi>as the</hi> Babylonians, Aſſyrians, <hi>and other ungodly</hi>

            </p>
            <p>3. That if ſuch <hi>Beaſts</hi> have but <hi>Great Power</hi> and <hi>Succeſs</hi> in

eachwherewith the Reader may eaſily compare them,
with more delight, and as much ſatisfaction, as if I had

<hi>And that which was their greateſt grievance,</hi> Praſutagus
<hi>King of the</hi> Iceni, <hi>famous for his</hi> riches, <hi>which he had been
a long time gathering, by his will made</hi> Claudius <hi>and his

booty, his wife <hi>Boadicia</hi> whipped, his Daughters deflowred,
the chiefeſt perſons of that Province diſpoſſeſſed of their lawfull
Inheritance, and the Kings kindred reputed and uſed as ſlaves.
<hi>Hereupon the</hi> Icenians <hi>began ſeriouſly to diſcourſe of their

ſo vile that we have not ſuffered, or indignity ſo contemptible, that

the Freedome of life will with me confeſſe (I am ſure) that Liberty

nothing left us that they can take away; having not ſo much

quit from Bondage, but we after death must live ſervile and pay
tribute even in our graves. Have the heavens made us the ends of
the world, and have not aſſigned us the ends of our wrongs? Or
hath nature among all her free works created us only <hi>Britons,</hi> for
bondage? Why, what are the <hi>Romans?</hi> are they more then men, or
immortall? Their ſlain carcaſſes ſacrificed by us, tell us, they are no

                  <p>From this memorable Story of <hi>Vortigerne, Aurelius
Ambroſius,</hi> and the <hi>Britons,</hi> and <hi>Saxons,</hi> theſe particulars are
obſerveable.</p>
                  <p>1. That the Britiſh Kings in thoſe times, debated all their
weighty affaires, and concluded all matters touching Warre,
Peace, and the publick defence of the Realm againſt inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

they likewiſe made Laws and Edicts.</p>

Soveraignes, uſurping their Crownes, bring commonly
great fearful Judgements on the whole Kingdome and
Nation, in caſe they comply with them therein.</p>
                  <p>4. That <hi>Vortegernes</hi> Treaſon in murdering his Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignes,
and uſurping their Crown, was the occaſion of,
and puniſhed with the long-laſting Warres with the <hi>Picts</hi>

                  <p>This Hiſtory (whether true or ſeigned) as it declares
by the <hi>Reſolution</hi> of thirteen <hi>Kings,</hi> and a great multitude
of <hi>Princes, Dukes, Nobles, Prelates, Souldiers,</hi> that Titles and
Tributes gotten by Force, Violence, Conqueſt, are both
irrational, unjuſt and illegal; So it reſolves, That the
Matters of Warre, Peace and other great Affaires of the
Realm, were determined in Parliament. That the Kings,
Princes and Nobles were the onely Parliaments and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament

impoſed on, or exacted from the Inhabitants of this Iſland,

by the Lawes and Cuſtomes of the Realm in the <hi>Britons</hi>

gained by force, conqueſt, or armed power without juſt

which Councils grant they could neither be juſtly char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,

by any civill or legall Right, by thoſe to whom they were
granted, and thereupon grew due by Law.</p>
                  <p>1. The firſt General Tax or Impoſition laid on and
