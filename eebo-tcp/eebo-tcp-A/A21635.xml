            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Queenes Maiestie vnderstandeth, that now of late
since the base and copper moneys of this Realme haue
(to the greate honour of the same) bene altered into
fine syluer moneys, by reason that a great parte of the
sayde base moneys were rated at sundry small values,
and that the greateste quantitie of the fine syluer mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys
nowe lately coyned, hath ben in greate peeces of
shyllinges, and but a small quantitie in grotes &amp; pence,
or halfpence, in respecte of haste and expedicion to
auoyde the base moneys: There is rysen great anoyaunce amongst the poorer sort
of her subiectes, for lacke of small moneys of fine syluer. Wherevpon her Maiestie
hauyng a perpetuall care from tyme to tyme, and from one degree to another, to
releeue the common hurtes or griefes of her subiectes, as they maye be perceiued:
hath presently ordered, that in her Myntes no more peeces of shyllynges shoulde be
coyned, but that besyde the peeces of grotes, halfgrotes, and pence, there shalbe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly
coyned in fine sterlyng moneys, halfe shyllynges of six pence, quarter shyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lynges
of three pence the peece, and a halfe peece thereof called three halfpence. And
because a halfpeny cannot be made of such finenesse to beare any conuenient bulke,
an other small peece shall also be coyned of three farthynges. All whiche peeces her
Maiestie assureth her subiectes shalbe of meere fine starling syluer. And whatsoeuer
may be reported to the contrary (as percase hath ben, though most falsly and slaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously
of the money already coined, as of late hath ben notoriously proued:) Her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie
letteth them all to vnderstande, that she neuer entendeth (Gods grace assistyng
her) to leese the fruicte of so famous an acte, by abasyng of the coyne of this Realme,
which she founde to be for the more parte copper, and hath nowe recouered it to be as
fine, or rather finer sterlyng syluer, then euer it was in this Realme by the space of
these two hundred yeres and more, a matter worth markyng and memory.

of golde and siluer be here in this Realme receiued of the subiectes vpon farre great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
values then they be worth, and that nor value certeine can be sette vpon them, by
reason the forrayne standardes of those moneys be so commonly chaunged for gaine,
and so easely counterfayted: By which meanes the subiectes receyuyng the same, be
dayly greater losers then they commonly can vnderstande, eyther in delyueryng mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
or wares for the same: Hath thought meete strayghtly to commaunde &amp; charge
her subiectes, that from henceforth they nether pay nor receiue any maner of coynes
forrayne of golde or syluer, as, and in the name of currant money, sauyng only the
Frenche crowne, and the Flemyshe or Burgondion crowne: the Printes wherof are
(for better knowledge) in the margent of this Proclamacion playnely sette foorth,
to be currant at the values lately limitted in a former Proclamacion, dated in Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber

haue any maner forrayne coynes of golde or syluer: the same shal from tyme to time
haue at the towre of London, fully as muche money in golde or syluer of the fine
coynes of this Realme, as the same shall holde in golde or syluer.
