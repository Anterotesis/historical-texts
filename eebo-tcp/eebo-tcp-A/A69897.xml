            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>THE Writer of theſe Papers
ſtands in a manner engag'd to
ſay ſomething upon this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
having in his Diſcourſes, publiſh'd
laſt Year, promis'd to handle ſeveral
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:93970:10"/>
Points concerning the Ballance of Trade;
to which Deſign he was principally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd
by the peruſal of ſome Calculations
then communicated to him by <hi>Gregory
King</hi> 
                  <abbr>Eſq</abbr> 
                  <hi>Lancaſter</hi> Herald.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Eſſay upon Ways and Means,</hi> and the
Diſcourſes lately ſet forth <hi>On the Revenues,</hi>
and <hi>On the Trade of</hi> England, did meet
with ſo good a Reception from the beſt
ſort of Men, that he finds himſelf en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courag'd
once more to offer to the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
his Obſervations of the like Nature;
from which, if any thing can be gather'd
that may promote, or that will hereafter
tend to the Welfare and Proſperity of his
Country, he ſhall think his Labours well
rewarded.</p>
               <p>'Tis true, his Computations were at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacked,
ſometime after they were pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh'd,
by two Pamphlets; but ſo impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tently,
that he thinks he cannot do him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
greater Right, than to deſire that all
People who give themſelves the trouble
to read his Writings, would likewiſe be
pleas'd to peruſe Mr. <hi>P. R.—y</hi>'s Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations,
and Mr. <hi>T. E.—d</hi>'s Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks
upon the ſaid Books. And he
doubts not, but that any Impartial Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
by comparing the Schemes together,
and by duly weighing the Arguments
of both ſides, will think theſe Anſwerers
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:93970:10"/>
have rather ſtrengthen'd and confirm'd,
than ſhaken his Foundations.</p>
               <p>'Tis an eaſie matter to pick out of any
Book, here and there, ſomething to Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
at; which is the common Method
taken by the little Scriblers of the Town
of Anſwering, as they call it, a Writer;
but all Judicious Men know that an able
Author proceeds quite another way; and
if his Adverſary has advanc'd a wrong
Propoſition, or a falſe Hypotheſis, he ſets
up ſomething in the room of what he
would pull down, he offers another Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
or Hypotheſis, which ſhall vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly
be truer, wiſer and better founded:
All other arguing (eſpecially where any
new Matter has been advanc'd) being
but wretched Sophiſtry, that carries with
it no Conviction. What has been here
ſaid, is all the Reply the Writer of
theſe Papers deſigns to make to the two
foremention'd Pamphlets and their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors,
who (whatever they may be good
for elſe) have ſhown by their Works,
that Figures and Calculations, about the
King's Revenue, are very little their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince.</p>
               <p>He thought it might be of uſe (in the
heat of a War that had then the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
of laſting a great while) to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
<hi>Ways and Means</hi> by which Taxes
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:93970:11"/>
might be laid more equally, and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence
more lightly upon the People:
And when the Peace was concluded, he
believ'd he might do his Country Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
to treat of the <hi>Publick Revenues</hi> and
of the <hi>Trade of</hi> England, the quiet Times
which the King's Valour and Wiſdom
had newly procur'd, ſeeming moſt ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
to propoſe ſome kind of Remedy
for thoſe Diſorders in the Adminiſtration,
which a War of ſuch length had undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly
occaſion'd. In the Tracts therefore
which he publiſh'd laſt Year, he handled
<hi>Credit, The King's Revenues, The Publick
Debts and Engagements;</hi> and in the ſecond
Volume ſeveral Points relating to Trade,
thereby to give ſome View, what Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements
this Nation was capable of,
under a careful and ſteady Manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>And having deeply imprinted in his
Mind, the Notion that all our Thoughts,
Endeavours and Deſignments ſhould
tend to the Good and Welfare of our
Country; and being convinc'd, that
even where Abilities are wanting, the
very Intentions are commendable and
virtuous, he is reſolv'd to continue his
Studies upon the ſame Subject, and to
look yet farther into the Condition and
Poſture of this Kingdom.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:93970:11"/>
He is now indeed call'd up to a Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
wherein he has the opportunity of
delivering his Thoughts concerning the
Buſineſs of <hi>England</hi> another way than
by his Pen; but 'tis many Years ſince he
had the Honour to ſit in Parliament;
and he doubts very much, whether he
ſhall be able to arrive at any degree of
expreſſing himſelf readily and well;
without which, the beſt and moſt uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
Matter loſes all its Energy and Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
before a great Aſſembly. Writing
and Speaking are Talents very different;
a tolerable Stile may be attain'd to by
great Application and Diligence, but
Elocution is a Gift (and if employ'd to
honeſt Uſes) one of the greateſt Bounties
Nature can beſtow upon a Man: He
who has not the Seeds of it within him,
ſhall never come at it by Art or La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour;
and (which perhaps is not vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garly
obſerv'd) Writing much extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhes
the Faculty of Talking well off
hand, in ſome Perſons who would other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
have a competent Share thereof;
for if the Writer be of any Form, he
accuſtoms himſelf to a Correctneſs and
a Choice of Words: And this Nicety
and Care beget a diffidency in him which
is altogether inconſiſtent with the Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs
of Speaking well in Publick. Such
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:93970:12"/>
therefore, as fear they cannot deliver
their Thoughts well and clearly another
way, muſt commit them to Writing, in
order to make whatever Qualities they
have, of Service to their Country.</p>
               <p>The Matters we have hitherto handled,
have been in a manner intirely new, and
ſuch wherein very little Help could be
had from Books; and (it being the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
of ſome Perſons of no ſmall Power
in the Management of Affairs, that many
Truths, important for <hi>England</hi> to be
known, ſhould rather be conceal'd, if
poſſible, in the Center of the Earth, than
laid open) the Aids and Lights which
might be gather'd from the publick Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compts
and Offices, have been induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
with-held from all who are not
ſervile Applauders of their wild and
diſtructive Conduct; however, he will
proceed on with his Work, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
the potent Malice of ſuch Men,
utterly indifferent how much his Inquiries
offend them, provided they yield any
Benefit to the King and Kingdom.</p>
               <p>His Aim always has been and ever ſhall
be, to ſhew how the Wealth and Strength
of <hi>England</hi> is to be ſecur'd and improv'd;
to ſet the Matters thereunto conducing
in a true Light; to inſtill into the Minds
of young Gentlemen a deſire of looking
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:93970:12"/>
into the Revenues and Trade of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
that having therein an inſight
themſelves, they may not be, in ſome fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
Reign, inſnar'd by the wicked Arts
of falſe and rapacious Miniſters, who
will be ever craving for large Supplies,
but careleſs how they waſt the publick
Treaſure; who will be always coveting
new Fonds, which they will lay by as
ſo much Lumber of the State, when they
have borrow'd all they can upon 'em,
not minding how any new Branch is
manag'd; who will be for ſhearing the
Sheep as many times as they can, every
Year, without any care of the Flock, or
how the Fleece ſhall grow again; and
who will be for pulling down the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth,
ſo they may build up their
own Fortunes.</p>
               <p>It ſhall not be here argu'd, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Skill of Phiſick be now brought
to Perfection, or whether it is yet capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of further Improvements; but this
may be ſafely pronounc'd, That the
Knowledge of the Sinews, Muſcles, Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries
and Veins, with the late diſcovery
of the Circulation of the Blood and all
the Parts of Anatomy, conduce very
much to render this dark Science more
plain and certain.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="8" facs="tcp:93970:13"/>
In the ſame manner, ſuch as would
underſtand the Body-Politick, its true
Conſtitution, its State of Health, its
Growth or Decay, its Strength or Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
and how to apply Remedies to the
various Diſtempers to which it is inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
muſt ſtudy and look narrowly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
all the diſtinct parts of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth,
its Trade, the Current Mony,
(which is its flowing Blood) the Arts,
Labour and Manufactures, and the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of its People; with many other
things which altogether are the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of which the great Body is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd.</p>
               <p>From theſe Topicks, to reaſon upon
Matters of Government, has been the
Method we have hitherto taken, and
which we ſhall perſue in the following
Tract; and the way we go of arguing
and concluding upon things by Figures,
being in a manner new, and made uſe
of but by two or three before us, and
that too but very ſuperficially, 'tis hop'd
Grains of Allowance will be made, and
that we ſhall be look'd npon as Beginners
of an Art not yet Poliſh'd, and which
Time may bring to more Perfection.</p>
               <p>In all Arts and Sciences, the firſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions
have been rude and unskilfull:
Very antiently, the <hi>Aegyptains</hi> knew
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:93970:13"/>
ſomething of Geometry, and the <hi>Aſſyri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
of Aſtronomy; but as well theſe, as
all other parts of Knowledge, were but
a ſhapeleſs Body, till brought into ſome
Form by the artfull Hands of <hi>Pherecides,
Thales, Anaximander</hi> and <hi>Pythagoras;</hi> and
yet Philoſophy had neither Strength nor
Beauty, till it was further improv'd in
the three ſucceſſive Schools of <hi>Socrates,
Plato</hi> and <hi>Ariſtotle.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What has been here ſaid of ſublimer
Things, holds as well in Speculations of
an inferiour Nature, and in Arts meerly
Mechanical, whoſe firſt Principles and
Rudiments muſt be imperfect. But if
this our manner of Inquiring into Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
that relate to Polity and Government,
be found any ways Inſtructive and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficial
to the Publick, we hope hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to be follow'd by abler Hands, who
ſhall finiſh what we are but beginning.</p>
               <p>We have formerly ſaid,<note n="*" place="margin">Diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes on the Publick Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues and Trade, <hi>part</hi> 2<hi>d</hi> p. 331.</note> 
                  <hi>That to find
out the true Ballance of Trade, in order to
adapt thereunto our Laws and Form of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,
would bring as much Wealth to this
Country, as is requiſite to render a Nation
ſafe and happy. That an exact Ballance between
<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s and every diſtinct Place, perhaps cannot
by any humane Skill be attain'd to; and that
it is not certain whether a Scrutiny ſo very
Nice, would be of any <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe. But that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:93970:14"/>
doubt, a general State of this Matter,
form'd upon ſtrict Enquiry, with Delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and Skill; and ſuch a one as would carry
with it a Demonſtration of being ſomewhat
near the Truth, muſt be a great Help to
the Rulers and Miniſters of a Country, and
a good Guide in many important Councils.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That we have been heretofore large
Gainers by Trade, is manifeſt from the
expenſive War we were able to carry on
for ſo many Years; and tho' to find out
in what Particulars we got or loſt, may be
very difficult; yet to give ſome general
View of the matter may not be impoſſible:
And we ſhall endeavour to ſhew from
whence ſuch may take their Riſe, who
would have ſome Proſpect of a thing ſo
vaſt and that ſeems at ſuch a diſtance.</p>
               <p>And albeit to know the <hi>Quantum</hi> of
our yearly Gains, may not perhaps ſo
much import the State; yet to be watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
that we do not loſe, waſt and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair
from time to time, muſt certainly
be the concern of every one who loves
his Country; and as it behoves private
Men frequently to Ballance their Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compts,
and to ſee how their Condition
ſtands; ſo without doubt, it is a Duty
incumbent upon thoſe who are in Power,
very often to contemplate the Poſture
of the Nation, in order to this, that
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:93970:14"/>
growing Miſchiefs may have a ſudden
Cure.</p>
               <p>As the Wealth of all kinds ſtor'd up in
this Kingdom was of late our chief Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port,
ſo what we are hereafter to get,
muſt defend us againſt the Accidents at
home and abroad, to which all Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
are liable; and upon this Account
the Motions of Trade ought to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd
with a ſtrict and careful Eye.</p>
               <p>And we owe it to our Country to
communicate what we think may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
to make it flouriſh; and the Men
in Power ſhould encourage ſuch At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts,
at leaſt they ſhould not oppreſs
nor contrive their Ruin, who employ
their whole time, and impair their own
Health, in ſtudying to promote the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Good.</p>
               <p>But they who Act upon a Principle are
not eaſily diſhearten'd. In this <hi>Eſſay</hi> we
ſhall ſet forth ſome probable Methods of
making a Nation Gainers in the Ballance
of Trade: And we ſhall cloſe the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
with endeavouring to ſhow, That
this Ballance is not to be put of our Side,
(by which we mean that a Country can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
increaſe in Wealth and Power) but
by private Men doing their Duty to the
Publick, and but by a ſteady Courſe
of Honeſty, Care and Wiſdom, in
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:93970:15"/>
ſuch as are truſted with the Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>The Wounds of the late War have
drein'd us of ſo much Blood, and our
Foreign Commerce has met with ſuch a
Ruffle and Interruption in all Parts of
the World, and our Neighbours grow ſo
faſt upon us, ſome in Wealth, and others
in Shipping and the Skill of Trade, that
Poverty muſt grow upon us apace, our
Naval Strength muſt decreaſe, and we
muſt utterly loſe the Dominion of the
Sea, unleſs the Legiſlative Authority
exert it ſelf with Vigor, and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
betimes to prevent our impending
Ruin.</p>
               <p>We have ſaid formerly,<note n="*" place="margin">Diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes on the Publick Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues and on Trade, <hi>Part</hi> 2<hi>d, p.</hi> 15.</note> 
                  <hi>That Gold
and Silver are indeed the Meaſure of Trade,
but that the Spring and Original of it, in all
Nations, is the Natural or Artificial Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
of the Country; that is to ſay, what
their Land, or what their Labour and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry
produces.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is no Man that can reaſonably
diſpute this Poſition; and if granted, it
follows from thence, That to know
rightly how the Ballance of Trade ſtands
with any Nation, a due Inſpection muſt
be made into their Natural or Artificial
Product.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="13" facs="tcp:93970:15"/>
But this Natural or Artificial Product
being moſt of it the Reſult of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
Labour and Induſtry, we ſhall be
ſtill in the dark as to all Inquiries of this
kind, without maturely conſidering the
Numbers of the People.</p>
               <p>In theſe ſort of Speculations not only
the Quantity but Quality of the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
muſt be duly ponder'd, they muſt
be divided into their ſeveral Ranks and
Claſſes: It muſt be diſtinguiſh'd who by
their Arts, Labour or Induſtry are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing,
and who by their Expence, Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty,
or Sloth, are decreaſing the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom's
Wealth. Of theſe Sub-diviſions
are likewiſe to be made, of what Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
are employ'd in the Church, in
War, in the Fleets Mercantile and War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like,
in the Law, in Offices, in Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize,
in Shop-keeping and Trades,
in Handicrafts; and who both of the
higher and lower Degree are Perſons
living upon their Eſtates; who are Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders,
Farmers, Labouring People,
Servants, Cottagers, Alms-People, and
Vagrants.</p>
               <p>The People being thus diſtributed into
their proper Ranks, we are likewiſe to
inquire into the Quality of the Land they
are to cultivate and improve, in order to
that Natural or Artificial Product which

                  <pb n="14" facs="tcp:93970:17"/>
is the Medium whereby a Superlucration
of Wealth is to be gotten. We ſhould
examin what Proportion of it is Arable,
Paſture and Meadow, Woods and Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pices,
Foreſts, Parks and Common,
Heaths, Moors, Mountains, and barren
Land, Houſes and Homeſteads, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
Lakes, Meers, Roads, Ways, and
waſt Land.</p>
               <p>The Land is to yield the Product,
which Product is to yield the Wealth,
ſo that we ſhould inquire how this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
ſtands in every particular, but more
eſpecially in the principal conſtituent
Parts of <hi>England</hi>'s Strength, namely
Wooll, Corn, and our Mines; for 'tis
by the well ordering and wiſe diſpoſition
of theſe Branches of our Wealth, that
we are to be Gainers in the Ballance of
Trade.</p>
               <p>We ſhall therefore handle diſtinctly
theſe Heads, <hi>viz.</hi> the People, the Land
and its Product, and ſhall endeavour to
lay down ſeveral Matters, from whence
(peradventure with good Grounds of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability)
ſome Concluſions may be made
in relation to our preſent Subject; and
becauſe Taxes influence very much in the
Ballance of Trade, as will be ſhown
hereafter, we ſhall likewiſe ſay ſomething
concerning our Payments to the Publick.</p>

               <p>THE Writer of theſe Papers has
ſeen the before-mentioned Mr.
<hi>King</hi>'s Natural and Political Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and Concluſions upon the State and
Condition of <hi>England</hi> in Manuſcript.
The Calculations therein contain'd are
very accurate, and more perhaps to be
rely'd upon than any thing that has been
ever done of the like kind. This Skilful
and Laborious Gentleman has taken the
right Courſe to form his ſeveral Schemes
about the Numbers of the People; for
beſides many different Ways of working,
he has very carefully inſpected the Poll-Books,
and the Diſtinctions made by
thoſe Acts, and the Produce in Mony of
the reſpective Polls, going every where
by reaſonable and diſcreet Mediums:
Beſides which Pains, he has made Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:93970:18"/>
of the very Facts in particular
Towns and Places, from which he has
been able to judge and conclude more
ſafely of others; ſo that he ſeems to have
look'd further into this Myſtery than any
other Perſon.</p>
               <p>With his Permiſſion, we ſhall offer to
the Publick ſuch of his Computations as
may be of uſe, and enlighten in the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
before us.</p>
               <p>He lays down, That if the firſt Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pling
of <hi>England</hi> was by a Colony or
Colonies, conſiſting of a Number be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
a Hundred and a Thouſand Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
(which ſeems probable) ſuch Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
or Colonies might be brought over be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Year of the World 2400 and
2600, <hi>viz.</hi> about eight or nine Hundred
Years after the Flood, and fourteen or
fifteen Hundred Years before the Birth
of Chriſt; at which time the World
might have about a Million of Families,
and four or five Millions of People.</p>
               <p>From which Hypotheſis, it will follow
by an orderly Series of Increaſe,</p>
               <p>That when the <hi>Romans</hi> invaded <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
fifty three Years before Chriſt's time,
the Kingdom might have about 360,000
People, and at Chriſt's Birth about
four hundred Thouſand.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="17" facs="tcp:93970:18"/>
That at the <hi>Norman</hi> Conqueſt, <hi>Ann.
Chriſt.</hi> 1066. the Kingdom might contain
ſomewhat above 2,000,000.</p>
               <p>That <hi>Anno</hi> 1260. or about 200 Years
after the <hi>Norman</hi> Conqueſt, it might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
about 2,750,000 People, or half the
preſent Number: So that the People of
<hi>England</hi> may have doubled in about 435
Years laſt paſt.</p>
               <p>That in probability the next doubling
will be in about 600 Years to come, <hi>viz.</hi>
by the Year 2300, at which time it may
have about 11,000,000 of People, and
the Kingdom containing about 39 Milli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of Acres, there will be then about
three Acres and a half <hi>per</hi> Head.</p>
               <p>That the Increaſe of the Kingdom for
every hundred Years of the laſt preceding

There are 71 or 72 Marriages in the
Country producing 343 Children.</p>
               <p>78 Marriages in Towns producing
351 Children.</p>
               <p>94 Marriages in <hi>London</hi> producing
376 Children.</p>
               <p>Whereby it follows,</p>
               <p>Firſt, That tho' each Marriage in
<hi>London</hi> produces fewer People than in the
Country, yet <hi>London</hi> in general having
a greater Proportion of Breeders, is more
prolifick than the other great Towns, and
the great Towns are more prolifick than
the Country.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That if the People of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi>
of all Ages were as long liv'd, as
thoſe in the Country, <hi>London</hi> would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe

to be</p>

and Adulteries.</p>
               <p>Secondly, From a greater Luxury and
Intemperance.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, From a greater Intenſneſs on
Buſineſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="22" facs="tcp:93970:23"/>
Fourthly, From the unhealthfulneſs of
the Coal Smoak.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, From a greater Inequality of
Age between the Husbands and Wives.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, From the Husbands and
Wives not living ſo long as in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.</p>

good Conduct and wholeſome Laws, and
if they have been Decreas'd by War, or
any other Accident, the Breach is to be
made up as ſoon as poſſible, for it is a
Maim in the Body Politick affecting all
its Parts.</p>
               <p>Almoſt all Countries in the World
have been more or leſs Populous, as Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
and Property have been there well
or ill ſecur'd. The firſt Conſtitution of
<hi>Rome</hi> was no ill founded Government,
a Kingly Power limited by Laws; and
the People increas'd ſo faſt, that from a
ſmall beginning, in the Reign of their
Sixth King, they were able to ſend out
an Army of 80000 Men. And in the
time of the Common-wealth, in that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſion
which the <hi>Gauls</hi> made upon <hi>Italy,</hi>
not long before <hi>Hannibal</hi> came thither,
they were grown ſo numerous, as that
their Troops conſiſted of 700,000 Foot
and 70,000 Horſe; 'tis true, their Allies
were comprehended in this Number, but
the ordinary People fit to bear Arms, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Muſter'd in <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Campania,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted
to 250,000 Foot and 23,000
Horſe.</p>
               <p>Nothing therefore can more contribute
to the rendering <hi>England</hi> Populous and
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:93970:29"/>
Strong, than to have Liberty upon a
right Foot, and our legal Conſtitution
firmly preſerv'd. A Nation may be as
well call'd free under a limited Kingſhip
as in a Common-wealth, and 'tis to this
good Form of our Government; that we
partly owe that doubling of the People,
which has probably happen'd here in the
435 Years laſt paſt. And if the Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of ſome, and the Mercenary Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
of others, ſhould bring us at any time
to alter our Conſtitution, and to give up
our ancient Rights, we ſhall find our
Numbers diminiſh viſibly and faſt. For
Liberty encourages Procreation, and not
only keeps our own Inhabitants among
us, but invites Strangers to come and live
under the ſhelter of our Laws.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Romans</hi> indeed made uſe of an
Adventitious Help to enlarge their City,
which was by incorporating Foreign Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
and Nations into their Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth;
but this way is not without its
Miſchiefs.<note place="margin">Machia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel'<hi>s Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes on</hi> Livy.</note> For the Strangers in <hi>Rome</hi> by
degrees had grown ſo numerous, and to
have ſo great a Vote in the Councils,
that the whole Government began to tot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and decline from its old, to its new
Inhabitants: Which <hi>Fabius</hi> the Cenſor
obſerving, he apply'd a Remedy in time
by reducing all the new Citizens into
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:93970:29"/>
four Tribes, that being contracted into
ſo narrow a ſpace, they might not have
ſo malignant an influence upon the City.</p>
               <p>An Act of General Naturalization,
would likewiſe probably Increaſe our
Numbers very faſt, and repair what Loſs
we may have ſuffer'd in our People by
the late War: 'Tis a Matter that has
been very warmly contended for by many
good Patriots; but peradventure it car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
alſo its Danger with it, which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
would have the leſs Influence by this
Expedient, namely, If an Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
were made, That no Heads of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies,
hereafter to be naturaliz'd for the
firſt Generation, ſhould have Votes in
any of our Elections. But as the Caſe
ſtands, it ſeems againſt the Nature of
right Government, that Strangers (who
may be Spies, and who may have an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
oppoſite to that of <hi>England,</hi> and
who at beſt ever join in one Link of Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequiouſneſs
to the Miniſters) ſhould be
ſuffer'd to intermeddle in that important
Buſineſs of ſending Members to Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
From their Sons indeed there is
leſs to fear, who by Birth and Nature
may come to have the ſame Intereſt and
Inclinations as the Natives.</p>
               <p>And tho' the Expedient of <hi>Fabius Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ximus,</hi>
to contract the Strangers into four
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:93970:30"/>
Tribes, might be reaſonable where the
Affairs of a whole Empire were tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted
by Magiſtrates choſen in one City,
yet the ſame Policy may not hold good
in <hi>England;</hi> Foreigners cannot influence
Elections here by being diſpers'd about
in the ſeveral Counties of the Kingdom,
where they can never come to have any
conſiderable ſtrength. But ſome time
or other, they may endanger the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
by being ſuffer'd to remain, ſuch
vaſt Numbers of 'em, here in <hi>London,</hi>
where they inhabit all together, at leaſt
30000 Perſons in two Quarters of the
Town, without inter-marrying with the
<hi>Engliſh,</hi> or learning our Language, by
which Means for ſeveral Years to come,
they are in a way ſtill to continue Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigners,
and perhaps may have a Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
Intereſt and Foreign Inclinations:
To permit this, cannot be adviſeable or
ſafe. It may therefore be proper to limit
any new Acts of Naturalization, with
ſuch Reſtrictions as may make the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion
of Strangers not dangerous to the
Publick.</p>
               <p>An Acceſſion of Strangers well regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated,
may add to our Strength and
Numbers; but then it muſt be compos'd
of Labouring Men, Artificers, Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants
and other rich Men, and not of
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:93970:30"/>
Foreign Soldiers, ſince ſuch fright and
drive away from a Nation more People
than their Troops can well conſiſt of:
For if it has been ever ſeen, that Men

of the Tyranny is mild and eaſie) it
muſt follow, that People will in time
deſert thoſe Countries whoſe beſt Flower
is their Liberties, if thoſe Liberties are
thought Precarious or in Danger. That
Foreign Souldiers are dangerous to Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,
we may produce Examples from

and when the Peace was made between

brought their Army home to be Paid and
Disbanded, which <hi>Geſco</hi> their General

order all his Part with great Dexterity
and Wiſdom. But the State of <hi>Carthage</hi>
wanting Mony to clear Arrears, and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie

them up longer than was deſign'd. The
Army conſiſted of <hi>Gauls, Ligurians, Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leareans
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:93970:31"/>
leareans</hi> and <hi>Greeks.</hi> At firſt they were
inſolent in their Quarters in <hi>Carthage,</hi>
and were prevail'd upon to remove to
<hi>Sicca,</hi> where they were to remain and
expect their Pay. There they grew pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
corrupted with Eaſe and Pleaſure,
and fell into Mutinies and Diſorder, and
to making extravagant demands of Pay
and Gratuities; and in a Rage, with
their Arms in their Hands, they march'd
Twenty Thouſand of them towards

two profligate Wretches for their Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,

Afterwards they caus'd almoſt all the

thirty of the principal Senators round

laſted three Years and near four Months
with exceſſive Cruelty; in which the
State of <hi>Carthage</hi> loſt ſeveral Battles, and
was often brought within a Hairs breadth
of utter Ruin.</p>
               <p>If ſo great a Common-wealth as <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage,</hi>
though aſſiſted at that time by

frighten a Wiſe State from deſiring ſuch

by the bringing over-Foreign Souldiers.</p>
               <p>Indeed, all Armies whatſoever, if
they are over large, tend to the diſpeop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling

               <p>Securing the Liberties of a Nation,
may be laid down as a Fundamental for
increaſing the Numbers of its People;

               <p>No Race of Men did multiply ſo faſt

               <p>But we in <hi>England</hi> have taken ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

thoſe who only contemplate the Pomp
and Wealth round about 'em, and in
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:93970:32"/>
their View; but they who look into all
the different Ranks of Men, are well
ſatisfied that this Duty on Marriages and
Births, is a very grevious Burthen upon
the poorer Sort, whoſe Numbers com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
the Strength and Wealth of any
Nation. This Tax was introduc'd by
the Neceſſity of Affairs. 'Tis difficult
to ſay what may be the Event of a new
thing; but if we are to take Meaſures
from paſt Wiſdom, which exempted Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifick
Families from Publick Duties, we
ſhould not lay Impoſitions upon thoſe
who find it hard enough to maintain

Weight upon the Poor, as to diſcourage
Marriage and hinder Propagation, which
seems the Truth, no doubt it ought to be
aboliſh'd; and at a convenient time we
ought to change it for ſome other Duty,
if there were only this ſingle Reaſon,
That 'tis ſo directly oppoſite to the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of all Ages and all Countries.</p>
               <p>In order to have Hands to carry on La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
and Manufactnres, which muſt make
us Gainers in the Ballance of Trade, we
ought not to deterr but rather invite
Men to marry, which is to be done by
Priviledges and Exemptions, for ſuch a
Number of Children, and by denying
certain Offices of Truſt and Dignities to
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:93970:33"/>
all unmarried Perſons; and where 'tis
once made a Faſhion among thoſe of the

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">See Scheme A.</note>Mr. <hi>King</hi> in his Scheme (for which he
has as Authentick Grounds, as perhaps the
Matter is capable of) lays down, That
the Annual Marriages of <hi>England</hi> are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
41,000, which is one Marriage out
of every 134 Perſons: Upon which we
obſerve, that this is not a due Proportion,
conſidering how few of our Adult Males
(in compariſon with other Countries)
periſh by War or any other Accident;
from whence may be infer'd, that our Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
is ſome way or other Defective, or
the Marriages would bear a nearer pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
with the groſs Number of our
People; for which Defect, if a Remedy
can be found, there will be ſo much
more Strength added to the Kingdom.</p>
               <p>From the Books of Aſſeſſment on Births,
Marriages, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> by the neareſt View he
can make, he divides the 5,500,000 Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
into 2,700,000 Males and 2,800,000
Females; from whence (conſidering the
Females exceed the Males in Number,
and conſidering that the Men marry later
than Women, and that many of the Males
are of Neceſſity abſent in the Wars, at Sea
and upon other Buſineſs) it follows, that
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:93970:33"/>
a large Proportion of the Females remain
unmarried, tho' at an Adult Age, which
is a dead Loſs to the Nation, every Birth
being as ſo much certain Treaſure; upon
which Accompt, ſuch Laws muſt be for the
Publick Good, as induce all Men to marry
whoſe Circumſtances permit it.</p>
               <p>From his Diviſion of the People, it
may be likewiſe obſerv'd, That the near
Proportion there is between the Males and
Females (which is ſaid to hold alſo in
other Places) is an Argument (and the
ſtrongeſt that can be produc'd) againſt
Poligamy, and the Increaſe of Mankind,
which ſome think might be from thence
expected; for if Nature had intended to
one Man a Plurality of Wives, She would
have order'd a great many more Female
Births than Male, her Deſignments being
always Right and Wiſe.</p>
               <p>The ſecuring the Pariſh for Baſtard-Children,
is become ſo ſmall a Puniſhment
and ſo eaſily Compounded, that it very
much hinders Marriage. The Dutch
compel Men of all Ranks, to marry the
Woman whom they have got with Child;
and perhaps it would tend to the farther
Peopling of <hi>England,</hi> if the Common Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
here, under ſuch a certain Degree, were
condemn'd by ſome new Law to ſuffer the
ſame Penalty.</p>

A Country that makes Proviſion to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe

adapted to Trade, will never fail to be
Gainers in the Ballance, provided the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour

manag'd and carefully directed.</p>
               <p>The more any Man contemplates theſe

Opinion, That <hi>England</hi> is capable of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

               </p>
               <p>'Tis not extent of Territory that makes
a Country Powerful, but Numbers of
Men well employ'd, convenient Ports, a
good Navy, and a Soil producing all ſort
of Commodities. The Materials for all
this we have, and ſo improveable, that if
we did but ſecond the Gifts of Nature,
with our own Induſtry, we ſhould ſoon
arrive to a pitch of Greatneſs, that would
put us at leaſt upon an equal Foot with any
of our Neighbours.</p>
               <p>If we had the Complement of Men,
our Land can maintain and nouriſh; If
we had as much Trade as our Stock and
Knowledge in Sea Affairs is capable of
embracing; If we had ſuch a Naval

and that Wealth which is the certain Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult
of a large and well govern'd Traffick,
what humane Strength could hurt or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade

               <p>Our Neighbouring Common-wealth
has not in Territory above Eight Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions
of Acres, and perhaps not much
above two Millions two Hundred Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand

What Forces have they reſiſted?
and to what a hight of Power are they

               <p>They are liable to frequent Invaſions;
They labour under the Inconvenience and

they have ſubdu'd by an unweary'd

               <p>We are fenc'd by Nature againſt Foreign

Irruptions of the Sea; Our Land Territory
at home is at leaſt 39 Millions of Acres;
We have in all likelihood not leſs than
Five Millions and a half of People; what

theſe Advantages were throughly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd,

               <p>They who apprehend the immoderate
growth of any Prince or State, may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
ſucceed by beginning firſt, and by
attempting to pull down ſuch a dangerous

Deſigns are diſappointed. In all appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
they proceed more ſafely, who un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
ſuch a fear make themſelves ſtrong and
powerful at home. And this was the
Courſe which <hi>Philip,</hi> King of <hi>Macedon,</hi>
the Father of <hi>Perſeus,</hi> took, when he
thought to be invaded by the <hi>Romans.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Greatneſs of <hi>Rome</hi> gave <hi>Carthage</hi>
very anxious Thoughts, and it rather
ſeems that they enter'd into the ſecond
Punick War, more for fear the <hi>Romans</hi>
ſhould have the Univerſal Empire, than
out of any Ambition to Lord it themſelves
over the whole World. Their Deſign
was virtuous, and peradventure wiſe to
endeavour at ſome early Interruption to a
Rival that grew ſo faſt: However we
ſee they miſcarry'd, tho' their Armies
were led by <hi>Hannibal.</hi> But Fortune which
had determin'd the Dominion of the Earth
for <hi>Rome,</hi> did perhaps lead them into the
fatal Council of paſſing the <hi>Eber,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:93970:35"/>
to the Articles of Peace concluded
with <hi>Aſdrubal,</hi> and of Attacking <hi>Sagun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,</hi>
before they had ſufficiently recover'd
of the Wounds they had ſuffer'd in the
Wars about <hi>Sicily, Sardinia,</hi> and with their
own Rebels. If the high Courage of
<hi>Hannibal</hi> had not driven the Common-wealth
into a new War, while it was yet
faint and weak, and if they had been
ſuffer'd to purſue their Victories in <hi>Spain,</hi>
and to get firm footing in that Rich War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
and then Populous Country, very
probably in a few Years they might have
been a more equal Match for the <hi>Roman</hi>
People. 'Tis true, if the <hi>Romans</hi> had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour'd
at the Conqueſt of <hi>Spain,</hi> and
if they had diſturb'd the <hi>Carthaginians</hi>
in that Country, the War muſt have been
unavoidable, becauſe it was evident in
that Age, and will be apparent in the
Times we live in, that whatever Foreign
Power already grown great, can add to
its dominion the Poſſeſſion of <hi>Spain,</hi> will
ſtand fair for Univerſal Empire.</p>
               <p>But unleſs ſome ſuch Cogent Reaſon
of State, as is here inſtanc'd, intervene, in
all appearance the beſt way for a Nation
that apprehends the growing Power of
any Neighbour, is to fortifie it ſelf with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in;
we do not mean by Land Armies,
which rather debilitate than ſtrengthen a
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:93970:36"/>
Country, but by Potent Navies, by Thrift
in the Publick Treaſure, Care of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
Trade, and all the other honeſt and
uſeful Arts of Peace.</p>
               <p>By ſuch an Improvement of our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Strength, agreeable to the Laws and
to the Temper of a Free Nation, <hi>England</hi>
without doubt may be brought to ſo good
a Poſture and Condition of defending it
ſelf, as not to apprehend any Neighbour
jealous of its Strength, or envious of its
Greatneſs.</p>
               <p>And to this end we open theſe Schemes,
That a Wiſe Government under which
we live, not having any Deſigns to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
Arbitrary, may ſee what Materials
they have to work upon, and how far our
Native Wealth is able to ſecond their good
Intentions of preſerving us a rich and a
free People.</p>
               <p>Having ſaid ſomething of the Number
of our Inhabitants, we ſhall proceed to
diſcourſe of their different Degrees and
Ranks, and to examin who are a Burthen
and who a Profit to the Publick; for by
how much every Part and Member of the
Common-wealth can be made uſeful to
the whole, by ſo much a Nation will be
more and more a Gainer in this Ballance
of Trade which we are to treat of.</p>

ariſe from the Gentry and better ſort, by
which Meaſures they neither contrive their
Impoſition aright, nor are they able to
give a true Eſtimate what it ſhall produce;
but when we have divided the Inhabitants
of <hi>England</hi> into their proper Claſſes, it
will appear that the Nobility and Gentry
are but a ſmall Part of the whole Body
of the People.</p>
               <p>Believing that Taxes fall chiefly upon
the better Sort, they care not what they
lay, as thinking they will not be felt;
but when they come to be levy'd, they
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:93970:37"/>
either fall ſhort, and ſo run the Publick
into an immenſe Debt, or they light ſo
heavily upon the Poorer Sort, as to oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
inſufferable Clamours; and they
whoſe proper Buſineſs it was to contrive
theſe Matters better, have been ſo unskil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
that the Legiſlative Power has been
more than once compell'd for the Peoples
eaſe to give new Fonds, inſtead of others
that had been ill projected.</p>
               <p>This may be generally ſaid, That all
Duties whatſoever upon the Conſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
of a large Produce, fall with the
greateſt weight upon the Common Sort:
So that ſuch as think in new Duties that
they chiefly tax the Rich, will find them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
quite miſtaken; for either their
Fond muſt yield little, or it muſt ariſe
from the whole Body of the People, of
which the Richer Sort are but a ſmall
Proportion.</p>
               <p>And tho' War, and National Debts
and Engagements, might heretofore very
rationally plead for Exciſes upon our
Home-Conſumption; yet now there is a
Peace, it is the concern of every Man that
loves his Country, to proceed warily in
laying new ones, and to get off thoſe
which are already laid as faſt as ever he
can. High Cuſtoms and high Exciſes
both together are incompatible, either of
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:93970:37"/>
them alone are to be endur'd, but to have
them co-exiſt is ſuffer'd in no well go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd
Nation. If Materials of Foreign
growth were at an eaſie rate, a high
Price might be the better born in things
of our own Product, but to have both
dear at once (and by reaſon of the Duties
laid upon them) is ruinous to the inferior
Rank of Men; and this ought to weigh
more with us, when we conſider that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
of the Common People, a Sub-divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
is to be made, of which one part
ſubſiſt from their own Havings, Arts,
Labour and Induſtry; and the other Part
ſubſiſt a little from their own Labour, but
chiefly from the Help and Charity of the
Rank that is above them. For according
to to Mr. <hi>King</hi>'s Scheme,</p>

               </list>
               <p>So that here ſeems a Majority of the
People, whoſe chief dependance and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance
is from the other Part, which Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jority
is much greater, in reſpect of the
Number of Families, becauſe 500,000
Families contribute to the ſupport of
850,000 Families. In Contemplation of
which, great Care ſhould be taken not to
lay new Duties upon the Home-Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption,
unleſs upon the extreameſt Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities
of the State; for tho' ſuch Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions
cannot be ſaid to fall directly upon
the lower Rank, whoſe Poverty hinders
them from conſuming ſuch Materials (tho'
there are few Exciſes, to which the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
Perſon does not pay ſomething) yet
indirectly, and by unavoidable Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences,
they are rather more affected by
high Duties upon our Home-Conſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
than the Wealthier Degree of People,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:93970:38"/>
and ſo we ſhall find the Caſe to be, if we
look carefully into all the diſtinct Ranks of
Men there enumerated.</p>
               <p>Firſt, As to the Nobility and Gentry,
they muſt of neceſſity retrench their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies
and Expences, if exceſſive Impoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
are laid upon all ſorts of Materials
for Conſumption; from whence follows,
That the Degree below them of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants,
Shop-keepers, Tradeſmen and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizans,
muſt want Employment.</p>
               <p>Secondly, As to the Manufactures, high
Exciſes in time of Peace, are utterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive
to that principal Part of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>'s
Wealth; for if Malt, Coals, Salt,
Leather, and other things bear a great
Price, the Wages of Servants, Workmen
and Artificers, will conſequently riſe, for
the Income muſt bear ſome proportion
with the Expence; and if ſuch as ſet the
Poor to work, find Wages for Labour,
or Manufacture advance upon them, they
muſt riſe in the Price of their Commodity,
or they cannot live; all which would ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie
little, if nothing but our own Deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
among one another were thereby af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected;
but it has a Conſequence far more
pernicious in relation to our Foreign
Trade, for 'tis the Exportation of our
own Product that muſt make <hi>England</hi>
rich; to be Gainers in the Ballance of
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:93970:39"/>
Trade, we muſt carry out of our own
Product, what will purchaſe the Things
of Foreign Growth that are needful
for our own Conſumption, with ſome
Overplus either in Bullion or Goods to
to be ſold in other Countries; which
Overplus is the Profit a Nation makes by
Trade, and it its more or leſs according
to the natural Frugality of the People that
Export, or as from the low Price of La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
and Manufacture they can afford the
the Commodity cheap, and at a rate not
to be under-ſold in Foreign Markets. The
Dutch, whoſe Labour and Manufactures
are dear, by reaſon of Home-Exciſes, can
notwithſtanding ſell cheap abroad, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
this diſadvantage they labour under
is ballanc'd by the Parſimonious Temper
of their People: But in <hi>England,</hi> where
this Frugality is hardly to be introduc'd,
if the Duties upon our Home-Conſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
are ſo large as to raiſe conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably
the price of Labour and Manufa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture,
all our Commodities for Exporta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
muſt by degrees ſo advance in the
prime Value, that they cannot be ſold at
a rate which will give 'em Vent in Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
Markets; and we muſt be every
where under-ſold by our wiſer Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours.
But the Conſequence of ſuch Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
in times of Peace, will fall moſt hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vily
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:93970:39"/>
upon our Woollen Manufactures, of
which moſt have more Value from the
Workmanſhip than the Material; and if
the Price of this Workmanſhip be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hanc'd,
it will in a ſhort Courſe of time
put a Neceſſity upon thoſe we deal with
of ſetting up Manufactures of their own,
ſuch as they can, or of buying Goods of
the like Kind and Uſe from Nations that
can afford them cheaper. And in this
Point we are to conſider, that the Bulk of
our Woollen Exports does not conſiſt in
Draperies made of the fine Wool, pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
to our Soil, but is compos'd of courſe
broad Cloaths, ſuch as <hi>Yorkſhire</hi> Cloaths,
Kerſies, which make a great part of our
Exports; and may be, and are made of
a courſer Wool, which is to be had in
other Countries: So that we are not ſingly
to value our ſelves upon the Material,
but alſo upon the Manufacture, which
we ſhould make as eaſie as we can, by
not laying over heavy Burthens upon the
Manufacturer: And our Woollen Goods
being two thirds of our Foreign Exports,
it ought to be chief Object of the
Publick Care, if we expect to be Gainers
in the Ballance of Trade, which is what
we hunt after in theſe Inquiries.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="48" facs="tcp:93970:40"/>
Thirdly, As to the lower Rank of all,
which we compute at 2,825,000 Heads,
a Majority of the whole People, their
principal Subſiſtance is upon the Degrees
above them; and if thoſe are render'd
uneaſie, theſe muſt ſhare in the Calamity,
but even of this inferiour Sort, no ſmall
Proportion contribute largely to Exciſes,
as Labourers and Out-Servants, which
likewiſe affect the Common Seamen, who
muſt thereupon raiſe their Wages, or they
will not have wherewithal to keep their
Families left at Home; and the high Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
of Seamen is another Burthen upon
our Foreign Traffick. As to the Cotta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
who are above a fifth Part of the
whole People, ſome Duties reach even
them, as thoſe upon Malt, Leather and
Salt, but not much becauſe of their ſlen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Conſumption; but if the Gentry, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
whoſe Woods and Gleanings they live,
and who employ 'em in Day Labour;
and if the Manufacturers, for whom
they Card and Spin, are over-burthen'd
with Duties, they cannot afford to give
them ſo much for their Labour and
Handy-work; nor to yield them thoſe
other Reliefs which are their principal
Subſiſtence, for want of which, theſe mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable
Wretches muſt periſh with Cold
and Hunger.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="49" facs="tcp:93970:40"/>
Thus we ſee Exciſes either directly or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>directly,
fall upon the whole Body of the
People; but we do not take notice of
theſe Matters, as receeding from our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Opinion: On the contrary, we ſtill
think them the moſt eaſie and equal way
of Taxing a Nation; and perhaps it is
demonſtrable, that if we had fallen into
this Method at the beginning of the War,
of raiſing the Year's Expence within the
Year, by Exciſes, <hi>England</hi> had not been
now indebted ſo many Millions; but what
was adviſeable, under ſuch a Neceſſity and
Danger, is not to be perſued in times of
Peace, eſpecially in a Country depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſo much upon Trade and Manufa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures.</p>
               <p>Our Study now ought to be how thoſe
Debts may be ſpeedily clear'd off, for
which theſe new Revenues are the Fonds,
that Trade may again move freely as it
did heretofore, without ſuch a heavy
Clogg; but this Point we ſhall more am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
handle, when we come to ſpeak of
our Payments to the Publick.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>King</hi> divides the whole Body of
the People, into two Principal Claſſes,
<hi>viz.</hi>

                  <item>Decreaſing the
Wealth of the
Kingdom,—2,825,000 Heads.</item>
               </list>
               <p>By which he means, That the Firſt
Claſs of the People, from Land, Arts and
Induſtry, maintain themſelves, and add
every Year ſomething to the Nation's Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Stock; and beſides this, out of their
Superfluity, contribute every Year ſo
much to the maintainance of Others.</p>
               <p>That of the Second Claſs, ſome partly
maintain themſelves by Labour (as the
Heads of the Cottage Families) but that
the reſt, as moſt of the Wives and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of theſe, ſick and impotent People,
idle Beggars and Vagrants, are nouriſh'd
at the Coſt of Others; and are a Yearly
Burthen to the Publick, conſuming An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nully
ſo much as would be otherwiſe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to the Nation's general Stock.</p>
               <p>The Bodies of Men are without doubt
the moſt valuable Treaſure of a Country;
and in their Sphere, the ordinary People
are as ſerviceable to the Common-wealth
as the rich, if they are employ'd in honeſt
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:93970:41"/>
Labour and uſeful Arts: And ſuch being
more in Number, do more contribute to
increaſe the Nation's Wealth, than the
higher Rank.</p>
               <p>But a Country may be Populous and
yet Poor (as were the ancient <hi>Gauls</hi>
and <hi>Scythians</hi>) ſo that Numbers, unleſs
they are well employ'd, make the Body
Politick big, but unweildy, ſtrong but
unactive, as to any Uſes of good Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>Their's is a wrong Opinion, who think
all Mouths profit a Country that conſume
its Product: And it may be more truly
affirm'd, That he who does not ſome way
ſerve the Common-wealth, either by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
employ'd, or by employing Others, is
not only a uſeleſs, but a hurtful Member to
it.</p>
               <p>As it is Charity, and what we indeed
owe to Humane Kind, to make Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
for the Aged, the Lame, the Sick,
Blind and Impotent: So 'tis a Juſtice we
owe to the Common-wealth, not to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
ſuch as have Health, and who might
maintain themſelves, to be Drones, and
live upon the Labour of Others.</p>
               <p>The Bulk of ſuch as are a Burthen to
the Publick, conſiſts in the Cottagers and
Paupers, Beggars in great Cities and
Towns, and Vagrants.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="52" facs="tcp:93970:42"/>
Upon a Survey of the Hearth Books,
made in <hi>Michaelmas,</hi> 1685. it was found
that of the 1,300,000 Houſes in the whole
Kingdom, thoſe of one Chimney amount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to 554,631; but ſome of theſe having
Land about them, in all our Calculations,
we have computed the Cottagers but at
500,000 Families. But of theſe, a large
Number, may get their own Livelihood,
and are no Charge to the Pariſh, for which
Reaſon Mr. <hi>King</hi> very judiciouſly computes
his <hi>Cottagers and Paupers, decreaſing the
Wealth of the Nation, but at</hi> 400,000 <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies;</hi>
in which Accompt, he includes
the poor Houſes in Cities, Towns and
Villages, beſides which he reckons 30,000
Vagrants; and all theſe together, to make
up 1,330,000 Heads.</p>
               <p>This is a very great Proportion of the
People to be a Burthen upon the other
Part, and is a Weight upon the Land-Intereſt;
of which the Landed Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
muſt certainly be very ſenſible.</p>
               <p>If this vaſt Body of Men, inſtead of
being Expenſive, could be render'd Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial
to the Common-wealth, it were a
Work no doubt highly to be promoted
by all who love their Country.</p>
               <p>It ſeems evident to ſuch as have conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
theſe Matters, and who have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd
how they are order'd in Nations
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:93970:42"/>
under a good Polity, that the Number of
ſuch who through Age or Impotence
ſtand in real need of Relief, is but ſmall
and might be maintain'd for very little;
and that the Poor Rates are ſwell'd to the
extravigant degree we now ſee 'em at,
by two ſorts of People, One of which,
by Reaſon of our ſlack Adminiſtration, is
ſuffer'd to remain in Sloth; and the
Other, through a Defect in our Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution,
continue in wretched Poverty for
want of Emplyment, tho' willing enough
to undertake it.</p>
               <p>All this ſeems capable of a Remedy,
the Laws may be arm'd againſt volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Idleneſs, ſo as to prevent it; and a
way may probably be found out to ſet
thoſe to Work who are deſirous to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
themſelves by their own Labour:
And if this could be brought about, it
would not only put a ſtop to the Courſe
of that Vice which is the Conſequence of
an idle Life, but it would greatly tend
to inrich the Common-wealth; for if the
Induſtry of not half the People maintains
in ſome degree the other part; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides,
in times of Peace did add every
Year near two Millions and a half to the
general Stock of <hi>England;</hi> to what pitch
of Wealth and Greatneſs might we not be
brought, if one Limb were not ſuffer'd
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:93970:43"/>
to draw away the Nouriſhment of the
other; and if all the Members of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
Politick were render'd uſeful to it.</p>
               <p>Nature, in her Contrivances, has made
every part of a living Creature either for
Ornament or Uſe; the ſame ſhould be in
a Politick Inſtitution rightly Govern'd.</p>
               <p>It may be laid down for an undenia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Truth, That where all work no bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
will want; and to promote this,
would be a greater Charity and more
Meritorious, than to build Hoſpitals,
which very often are but ſo many Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of ill-gotten Riches, attended with
late Repentance.</p>
               <p>To make as many as poſſible of theſe
1,330,000 Perſons (whereof not above
330,000 are Children too young to work)
who now live chiefly upon others, get
themſelves a large ſhare of their Mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
would be the opening a new Vein
of Treaſure of ſome Millions Sterling
<hi>per Annum;</hi> it would be a preſent Eaſe
to every particular Man of Subſtance, and
a laſting Benefit to the whole Body of
the Kingdom: For it would not only
nouriſh but increaſe the Numbers of the
People, of which many Thouſands periſh
every Year, by thoſe Diſeaſes contracted
under a ſlothful Poverty.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="55" facs="tcp:93970:43"/>
Our Laws relating to the Poor are very
numerous, and this Matter has employ'd
the Care of every Age for a long time,
tho' but with little ſucceſs, partly through
the ill Execution, and partly through ſome
defect in the very Laws.</p>
               <p>The Corruptions of Mankind are grown
ſo great, that, now a-days, Laws are not
much obſerv'd, which do not in a manner
execute themſelves; of this Nature are
thoſe Laws which relate to bringing in
the Prince's Revenue, which never fail to
be put in Execution, becauſe the People
muſt pay, and the Prince will be paid;
but where only one part of the Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
the People, are immediately con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd,
as in Laws relating to the Poor,
the High-ways, Aſſizes, and other Civil
Oeconomy, and good Order in the State,
thoſe are but ſlenderly regarded.</p>
               <p>The Publick Good being therefore,
very often, not a Motive ſtrong enough
to engage the Magiſtrate to perform his
Duty, Law-givers have many times for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify'd
their Laws with Penalties, wherein
private Perſons may have a Profit, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
to ſtir up the People to put the Laws
in Execution.</p>
               <p>In Countries deprav'd, nothing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
well, wherein particular Men do not
one way or other find their Accompt,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:93970:44"/>
and rather than a Publick Good ſhould
not go on at all; without doubt, 'tis bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to give Private Men ſome Intereſt to
ſet it forward.</p>
               <p>For which Reaſon, it may be worth
the Conſideration of ſuch as ſtudy the
Proſperity and Welfare of <hi>England,</hi> whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
this great Engine of maintaining the
Poor, and finding them Work and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment,
may not be put in Motion by
giving ſome Body of Undertakers a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
Gain to put the Machine upon its
Wheels.</p>
               <p>In Order to which, we ſhall here incert

Poor Rates, or the Monthly Aſſeſſment,
it would be moſt convenient; and Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
may be made, That no Perſon ſhall
transfer his Intereſt but to one of the ſame
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:93970:45"/>
County, which will keep the Intereſt there
during the Term; and as to its being one
Corporation, 'tis preſum'd this will be
moſt beneficial to the Publick. For firſt,
All Diſputes on Removes, which ane very
chargeable and burthenſome, will be at an
end, this Propoſal intending, that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
the Poor are, they ſhall be maintain'd
or employ'd. Secondly, It will prevent
one County which ſhall be diligent, impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
on their Neighbours who may be
negligent, or getting away their Manufa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures
from them. Thirdly, In Caſe of
Fire, Plague, or loſs of Manufacture, the
Stock of one County may not be ſufficient
to ſupport the Places where ſuch Calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
may happen; and 'tis neceſſary the
whole Body ſhould ſupport every particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Member, ſo that hereby there will be
a general Care to adminiſter to every Place
according to their Neceſſities.</p>
                           <p>Secondly, That the ſaid Corporation
be eſtabliſh'd for the Term of one and
twenty Years.</p>
                           <p>The Corporation ought to be eſtabliſh'd
for one and twenty Years, or otherwiſe it
cannot have the benefit the Law gives in
Caſe of Infants, which is their Service for
their Education; beſides, it will be ſome
Years before a matter of this Nature can
be brought into Practice.</p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="59" facs="tcp:93970:45"/>
Thirdly, That the ſaid Sum of 300,000 <hi>l.</hi>
be paid in, and laid out for the Purpoſes
aforeſaid, to remain as a Stock for and
during the ſaid Term of one and twenty
Years.</p>
                           <p>The Subſcription ought to be taken at
the Paſſing of the Act, but the Corpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to be left at liberty, to begin either
the <hi>Michaelmas</hi> or the <hi>Lady</hi>-Day after, as
they ſhall think fit. And <hi>per
Cent.</hi> to be paid at the ſubſcribing to Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
appointed for that purpoſe, and the
remainder before they begin to Act; but ſo
as 300,000 <hi>l.</hi> ſhall be always in Stock dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Term, notwithſtanding any Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidends
or other Diſpoſition: And an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt
thereof to be exhibited twice in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
Year upon Oath, before the Lord
Chancellor for the time being.</p>
                           <p>Fourthly, That the ſaid Corporation do
by themſelves, or Agents in every Pariſh
of <hi>England,</hi> from and after the
Day of during the ſaid Term of
one and twenty Years, provide for the
real Impotent Poor good and ſufficient
Maintainance and Reception, as good or
better than hath at any time within the
ſpace of Years before the ſaid
Day of been provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
or allow'd to ſuch Impotent Poor, and
ſo ſhall continue to provide for ſuch Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:93970:46"/>
Poor, and what other growing
Impotent Poor ſhall happen in the ſaid Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh
during the ſaid Term.</p>
                           <p>By Impotent Poor is to be underſtood
all Infants and old and decrepid Perſons not
able to Work; alſo Perſons who by Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
or any Accident are for the time una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to labour for themſelves or Families;
and all Perſons (not being fit for Labour)
who were uſually reliev'd by the Mony
rais'd for the uſe of the Poor; they ſhall
have Maintainance, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as good or bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
as within Years they us'd to
have.</p>
                           <p>This does not directly determine what
that ſhall be, nor is it poſſible, by reaſon
a Shilling in one County is as much as two
in another; but it will be the Intereſt of
the Corporation that ſuch Poor be well
provided for, by reaſon the contrary will
occaſion all the Complaints or Clamour
that probably can be made againſt the
Corporation.</p>
                           <p>Fifthly, That the Corporation do pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
(as well for all ſuch Poor which on
the ſaid Day of ſhall be
on the Poor Books, as for what other
growing Poor ſhall happen in the ſaid
Term, who are or ſhall be able to labour
or do any work) ſufficient Labour and
Work proper for ſuch Perſons to be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:93970:46"/>
in. And that Proviſion ſhall be
made for ſuch labouring Perſons accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to their Labour, ſo as ſuch Proviſion
doth not exceed 3/4 parts, as much as any
other Perſon would have paid for ſuch
Labour. And in Caſe they are not em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd
and ſet to work, then ſuch Perſons
ſhall, until Materials or Labour be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
for them, be maintain'd as Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
Poor; but ſo as ſuch Perſons who
ſhall hereafter enter themſelves on the
Poor's Books, being able to Labour, ſhall
not quit the Service of the Corporati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
without leave, for the ſpace of ſix
Months.</p>
                           <p>The Corporation are to provide Mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials
and Labour for all that can work,
and to make Proviſion for them not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
¾ parts as much as any other Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
would give for ſuch Labour. For
Example, if another Perſon would give
one of theſe a Shilling, the Corporation
ought to give but Nine Pence. And the
Reaſon is plain, Firſt, Becauſe the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration
will be oblig'd to maintain them
and their Families in all Exigences, which
others are not oblig'd to do, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
they ought not to allow ſo much
as others. Secondly, In Caſe any Perſons
able to Labour, ſhall come to the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration,
when their Agents are not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:93970:47"/>
with Materials to employ them, by
this Propoſal, they are to allow them full
Proviſion as Impotent Poor, until they
find them Work, which is intirely in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
of the Poor. Thirdly, It is neither
reaſonable nor poſſible for the Corporation
to provide Materials upon every Occaſion,
for ſuch Perſons as ſhall be enter'd with
them, unleſs they can be ſecure of ſuch Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
to work up thoſe Materials; beſides,
without this Proviſion, all the labouring
People of <hi>England</hi> will play faſt and looſe
between their Employers and the Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
for as they are diſoblig'd by one,
they will run to the other, and ſo neither
ſhall be ſure of them.</p>
                           <p>Sixthly, That no Impotent Poor ſhall
be remov'd out of the Pariſh where they
dwell, but upon notice in Writing given
to the Church-wardens or Overſeers of the
ſaid Pariſh, to what place of Proviſion he
or ſhe is remov'd.</p>
                           <p>It is judg'd the beſt Method to provide
for the Impotent Poor in Houſes prepar'd
for that purpoſe, where proper Proviſion
may be made for ſeveral, with all Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries
of Care and Maintenance. So that
in ſome places one Houſe will ſerve the
Impotent Poor of ſeveral Pariſhes, in which
Caſe the Pariſh ought to know where to
reſort, to ſee if good Proviſion be made for
them.</p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="63" facs="tcp:93970:47"/>
Seventhly, That in caſe Proviſion be
not made for the Poor of each Pariſh, in
manner as aforeſaid, (upon due notice
given to the Agents of the Corporation)
the ſaid Pariſh may order their Poor to
be maintain'd, and deduct the Sum by
by them expended out of the next Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
to be made to the ſaid Corpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
by the ſaid Pariſh.</p>
                           <p>In caſe any Accident happens in a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh,
either by Sickneſs, Fall, Caſualty of
Fire, or otherways; and that the Agent
of the Corporation is not preſent to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
for them, or having notice doth not
immediately do it, the Pariſh may do it,
and deduct ſo much out of the next Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
but there muſt be Proviſion made
for the notice, and in what time the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration
ſhall provide for them.</p>
                           <p>Eighthly, That the ſaid Corporation
ſhall have and receive for the ſaid one
and twenty Years, That is to ſay, from
every Pariſh Yearly, ſo much as ſuch Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh
paid in any One Year, to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
by a Medium of Seven Years;
namely, from the 25th of <hi>March,</hi> 1690.
to the 25th of <hi>March,</hi> 1697. and to be
paid half Yearly; and beſides, ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the Benefit of the Revenues of all
Donations given to any Pariſh, or which
ſhall be given during the ſaid Term, and
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:93970:48"/>
all Forfeitures which the Law gives to
the Uſe of the Poor; and to all other
Sums which were uſually collected by the
Pariſh, for the maintainance of the Poor.</p>
                           <p>Whatever was rais'd for or apply'd to
the Uſe of the Poor, ought to be paid
over to the Corporarion; and where there
are any Donations for maintaining the
Poor, it will anſwer the Deſign of the
Donor, by reaſon there will be better Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion
for the maintainance of the Poor
than ever; and if that maintainance be
ſo good, as to induce further Charities,
no doubt the Corporation ought to be
entitled to them: But there are two Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections
to this Article; Firſt, That to
make a Medium by a time of War is
unreaſonable. Secondly, To continue the
whole Tax for One and Twenty Years,
does not ſeem to give any Benefit to the
Kingdom in that time. To the Firſt, It
is true, we have a Peace, but Trade is
lower now than at any time during the
War, and the Charge of the Poor great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er;
and when Trade will mend, is very
uncertain. To the Second, It is very
plain, that although the Charge may be
the ſame to a Pariſh in the Total, yet it
will be leſs to particular Perſons, becauſe
thoſe who before receiv'd Alms, will
now be enabled to be Contributors; but
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:93970:48"/>
beſides, the turning ſo many hundred
thouſand Pounds a Year (which in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
have hitherto been apply'd only to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
Idleneſs) into Induſtry; and the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploying
ſo many other idle Vagrants and
ſturdy Beggars, with the Product of their
Labour, will altogether be a preſent Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
to the Lands of <hi>England,</hi> as well in
the Rents as in the Value: And further,
the accidental Charities in the Streets and
at Doors, is, by a very modeſt Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation,
over and above the Poor Rates,
at leaſt 300,000 <hi>l. per Annum,</hi> which will
be intirely ſav'd by this Propoſal, and
the Perſons ſet at work; which is a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Conſideration for its being well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd,
ſince the Corporation are not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd
any thing for this Service.</p>
                           <p>The greater the Encouragement is, the
better the Work will be perform'd; and
it will become the Wiſdom of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in what they do, to make it effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual;
for ſhould ſuch an Undertaking
as this prove ineffectual, inſtead of reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dying
it, will increaſe the Miſchief.</p>
                           <p>Ninthly, That all the Laws made for
the Proviſion of the Poor, and for puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
idle Vagrant Perſons be repeal'd, and
one Law made to continue ſuch parts as
are found uſeful, and to add ſuch other
Reſtrictions, Penalties and Proviſions as
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:93970:49"/>
may effectualy attain the End of this great
Work.</p>
                           <p>The Laws hereunto relating are nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,
but the Judgment and Opinions
given upon them are ſo various and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictory,
and differ ſo in ſundry places,
as to be inconſiſtent with any one general
Scheme of Management.</p>
                           <p>Tenthly, That proper Perſons be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
in every County to determine all
Matters and Differences which may ariſe
between the Corporation and the reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive
Pariſhes.</p>
                           <p>To prevent any ill Uſage, Neglect or
Cruelty, it will be neceſſary to make Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion
that the Poor may tender their
Complaints to Officers of the Pariſh; and
that thoſe Officers having examin'd the
ſame, and not finding Redreſs, may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
to Perſons to be appointed in each
County and each City for that purpoſe,
who may be call'd Superviſors of the
Poor, and may have Allowance made
them for their Trouble; and their Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
may be to examine the Truth of ſuch
Complaints; and in caſe either the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh
or Corporation judge themſelves
agriev'd by the Determination of the ſaid
Superviſors, Proviſion may be made that
an Appeal lie to the Quarter Seſſions.</p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="67" facs="tcp:93970:49"/>
Eleventhly, That the Corporation be
oblig'd to provide for all publick Beggars,
and to put the Laws in Execution againſt
publick Beggars and idle vagrant Perſons.</p>
                           <p>Such of the publick Beggars as can
work muſt be employ'd, the reſt to be
maintain'd as impotent Poor; but the Laws
to be ſeverely put in Execution againſt
thoſe who ſhall ask any publick Alms.</p>
                        </div>
                     </body>
                  </floatingText>
               </q>
               <p>THis Propoſal, which in moſt parts of
it ſeems to be very maturely weigh'd,
may be a Foundation for thoſe to build
upon, who have a publick Spirit large
enough to embrace ſuch a noble Undertak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>But the common Obſtruction to any
thing of this Nature, is a malignant Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
in ſome who will not let a publick
Work go on, if private Perſons are to be
Gainers by it: When they are to get them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
they abandon all Senſe of Virtue,
but are cloath'd in her whiteſt Robe;
when they ſmell Profit coming to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
masking themſelves with a falſe
Zeal to the Common-wealth, where their
own Turn is not to be ſerv'd. It were
better indeed, that Men would ſerve their
Country for the Praiſe and Honour that
follow good Actions; but this is not to
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:93970:50"/>
be expected in a Nation, at leaſt leaning
towards Corruption; and in ſuch an Age
'tis as much as we can hope for, if the
Proſpect of ſome honeſt Gain invites Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
to do the Publick faithful Service. For
which Reaſon, in any Undertaking where
it can be made apparent that a great Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
will accrue to the Common-wealth
in general, we ought not to have an evil
Eye upon what fair Advantages particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Men may thereby expect to Reap, ſtill
taking care to keep their Appetite of get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
within moderate Bounds, laying all
juſt and reaſonable Reſtraints upon it,
and making due Proviſion that they may
not wrong or oppreſs their Fellow Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects.</p>
               <p>'Tis not to be deny'd, but that if fewer
Hands were ſuffer'd to remain idle, and
if the Poor had full Employment, it
would greatly tend to the Common Wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare,
and contribute much towards add<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
every Year to the general Stock of
<hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Among the Methods that we have here
propos'd of Employing the Poor, and
making the whole Body of the People uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to the Publick: We think it our Duty
to mind thoſe who conſider the Common
Welfare of looking with a compaſſionate
Eye into the Priſons of this Kingdom,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:93970:50"/>
where many Thouſands conſume their
Time in Vice and Idleneſs waſting the
Remainder of their Fortunes, or laviſhing
the Subſtance of their Creditors, eating
Bread and doing no Work, which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to good Order, and pernicious to
the Common-wealth.</p>
               <p>We cannot therefore but recommend
the Thoughts of ſome good Bill that may
effectually put an end to this Miſchief ſo
ſcandalous in a Trading Country, which
ſhould let no Hands remain uſeleſs.</p>
               <p>'Tis not all difficult to contrive ſuch a
Bill as may Relieve and Releaſe the Deb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,
and yet preſerve to his Creditors all
their fair, juſt and honeſt Rights and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt.</p>
               <p>And having in this Matter endeavour'd
to ſhow that to preſerve and increaſe the
People, and to make their Numbers uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
are Methods conducing to make us
Gainers in the Ballance of Trade, we ſhall
proceed to handle the ſecond Head.</p>

This is only the Neat Produce, exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive

               <p>Theſe 79 Millions of Buſhels of Grain

the Produce is full four Rents.</p>

               <p>From theſe Schemes we ſhall make ſuch
Obſervations as we think may relate to our
preſent Subject.</p>
               <p>Of the 39 Millions of Acres in Terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
belonging to <hi>England</hi> he lays down,
that there may be above a fourth part, <hi>viz.</hi>
ten Millions of Acres in Heaths, Moors,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:93970:57"/>
Mountains and Barren Land; three Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions
of Acres in Woods and Coppices,
and three Millions in Foreſts, Parks and
Commons. This Diviſion of the Land
ſeems to be made with great Judgment;
Firſt, Becauſe it agrees very well with the
Conſumption of ſeveral Commodities, of
which we can come at a near knowledge
by the Exciſes now in being. Secondly,
It correſponds exactly with that Increaſe
in the Kingdoms General Rental, which
for theſe laſt hundred Years may have
been obſerv'd from the Produce of divers
Land-Taxes, and from ſeveral other Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars.</p>
               <p>And there are undeniably Reaſons to
be given, That this General Rental, <hi>Anno</hi>
1600. did not exceed ſix Millions <hi>per
Annum,</hi> but through the help of that
Wealth which has flow'd in to us by our
Foreign Trade, it has advanc'd in ſeveral
Periods of time from 6 to 8, from 8 to
10, and from 10 to 14 Millions <hi>per An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num.</hi>
When the General Rental was but
ſix Million <hi>per Annum,</hi> there was a great
deal more barren Land, of that which
was cultivated very much was capable
of Melioration; and there were more
Foreſts, Woods, Coppices, Commons,
and waſt Ground than there is now,
which our Wealth did enable us from
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:93970:58"/>
time to time to incloſe, cultivate and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove.</p>
               <p>And for the future, as we grow in
Riches, and as our People increaſe, thoſe
many Millions of Acres which now are
Barren, will by degrees moſt of them be
improv'd and cultivated; for there is hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
any ſort of Ground, which Numbers
of Men will not render fertile; but then
it muſt be ſuppos'd, that we do not go
backward in our Trade, for if that ſhould
happen, inſtead of improving what is
waſt, that which is improv'd and culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated
will rather return to the Wildneſs
and Deſolation of former Times; for as
we have ſaid in our former Diſcourſes,
Land and Trade riſe and fall together.
Trade brings in the Stock, this Stock well
and induſtriouſly manag'd betters Land,
and brings more Product of all kind for Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portation;
the Returns of which Growth
and Product are to make a Country Gainers
in the Ballance.</p>
               <p>As to our quantity of Land, in Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to its Inhabitants, as the Caſe ſtands,
we ſeem now to have about 7 ¼ Acres <hi>per</hi>
Head; but there are many Reaſons to
think, that <hi>England</hi> is capable of nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
double its preſent Number of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
which ſuppoſing them now to be
5,500,000 would be eleven Millions, and
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:93970:58"/>
even then there will be as many Acres
<hi>per</hi> Head as they have in <hi>Holland.</hi> And
when we have this Complement of Men,
either in the natural Courſe of time, or
ſooner by the help of good Conduct, we
ſhall be in a State of Power to deal with
any Strength in <hi>Europe.</hi> In the natural
Courſe of time this cannot happen in a
great while, but the common Progreſſion
of things may be haſten'd by Art, ſo that
if we are ſtudious to preſerve and increaſe
our People, peradventure in not many
Years, we may have Hands enow, not
only to make us ſafe from the Inſults of
others, but to render us formidable to all
our Neighbours: And Men being the
trueſt Strength and Riches of a Country,
the Councils of all Wiſe States ſhould
tend to obtaining and keeping together as
many as the Land will Nouriſh. There
are indeed Countries, to whom their full
Complement of Inhabitants would be dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous,
and ſubject them to frequent Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines
in bad and unſeaſonable Years for
Corn. As for Example, if <hi>France</hi> had
had as many People as the Land will feed
in times of common Plenty, half of 'em
muſt have periſh'd during their late
Dearths for want of Bread, becauſe they
have a vaſt Inland Country, and only the
Out Parts upon ſuch an Emergency can
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:93970:59"/>
be reliev'd by the Aſſiſtance of other Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
And we ſee that anciently before
there was much Trade, there were fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
Famines in the World, becauſe one
Part could not then help another; for
which Reaſon, the Northern Nations here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore,
when their People multiply'd too
faſt, did disburthen themſelves by ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out numerous Colonies to ſeek out
new Dwellings, in apprehenſion that by
a ſcarce Year they might be diſtroy'd at
home; but <hi>England</hi> (with any moderate
Care) is not liable to ſuch a Fear, tho'
its preſent Numbers ſhould even be doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
becauſe we have every where the Sea
to Friend, and in ſuch an Extremity our
Wants may be ſupply'd from other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               <p>And our Matter leading us into it, it
may not be unneceſſary here to take No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice,
That Countries not over-ſtock'd with
Men, and tho' Situate, ſo as to be reliev'd
by the Sea, may ſuffer greatly, and be
reduc'd very low for want of Corn, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
they make ſome due Proviſion againſt
ſuch a Calamity.</p>
               <p>The value of the Wheat, Barly and
Rye, neceſſary for the Suſtenance of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
amounts at leaſt to ſix Millions of
Pounds <hi>per Annum</hi> at the common Rate;
from whence 'tis apparent, That if a long
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:93970:59"/>
Dearth ſhould happen here, ſuch as they
lately had in <hi>France,</hi> tho' we may be
ſupply'd upon more eaſie Terms than
<hi>France</hi> was, and tho' we might ſtill keep
our People alive, yet that a Diſaſter of
this kind would exhauſt more of our
Mony than a War of ten Years continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.
Suppoſe (which God forbid) that
for two or three Years ſucceſſively the
Seaſon ſhould prove ſo bad as to deprive
us of half our uſual Crop; to ſupply ſuch
a Want, what immenſe Summs muſt be
carry'd out of the Kingdom? And it may
be made evident, that ſuch a Scarcity did
very much drein the <hi>French.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To provide againſt a Calamity of the
like Nature, is no doubt of the higheſt
Conſequence. That we have been defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
in this point of Polity is too Notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
tho' Providence has taken more Care
of us than a Negligent People deſerve.
However, we have had outragious Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines
in <hi>England,</hi> and in <hi>Edward</hi> the 3ds
Reign, Corn did once riſe to 13 times the
common value; this indeed can hardly
happen again, becauſe there are more dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
ſorts of Soils improv'd and manur'd
now than in that Age; but at ſeveral
times we have ſuffer'd Wants of this kind
very afflicting, and ſometime or other our
Negligence in a Matter of ſuch concern
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:93970:60"/>
to the People's Welfare, may come to be
more ſeverely puniſh'd.</p>
               <p>By the beſt Accompts we are able to
procure from ſuch as have look'd into theſe
things, we find that in <hi>England,</hi> in a
plentiful Year, there is not above five
Months ſtock of Grain at the time of the
ſucceeding Harveſt, and not above four
Months Stock in an indifferent Year,
which is but a ſlender Proviſion againſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Evil Accident. We enjoy the benefit
of ſuch different Soils, <hi>viz.</hi> High Lands
and Low Lands, where one hits when
the other fails, that now a-days we ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
ſee Corn above treble its common
Rate, which however would be fatal, if
it ſhould at any time continue ſo long as
to make large Supplies from abroad neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
to us. 'Tis obſerv'd, That but 1/10
defect in the Harveſt may raiſe the Price
3/10, and when we have but half our Crop
of Wheat, which now and then happens,
the remainder is ſpun out by Thrift and
good Management, and eked out by the
uſe of other Grain; but this will not do
for above one Year, and would be a ſmall
help in the ſucceſſion of two or three un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſonable
Harveſts: For the ſcarcity even
of one Year is very deſtructive, in which
many of the pooreſt Sort periſh, either for
want of ſufficient Food, or by unwholſome
Diet.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="83" facs="tcp:93970:60"/>
We take it, That a Defect in the Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt
may raiſe the Price of Corn in the
following Proportions.</p>

               <p>So that when Corn riſes to treble the
Common Rate, it may be preſum'd, that
we want above a third of the Common
Produce; and if we ſhould want 5 Tenths,
or half the Common Produce, the Price
would riſe to near five times the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Rate.</p>
               <p>We dwell the longer upon this Subject,
being convinc'd in Judgment, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in the World can more impoveriſh
a Country, nor tend more to ſet it back
with other People in the Ballance of Trade
for a long while, than ſuch a Calamity;
'tis indeed the Scourge of God, but im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provident
States are more liable to it than
wiſer Nations.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Hollanders</hi> cannot nouriſh their
People from their Territory, and muſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
ſeek for Aſſiſtance from abroad;
but in Proſpect that the Harveſt may be
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:93970:61"/>
bad now and then, in ſome and even in
all thoſe Places from whence they fetch
their Corn, whereby in ſcarce times they
would be impos'd upon. They take care
to have Granaries and Store-houſes, where
in plentiful Years they lay up vaſt Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities
of all ſort of Grain againſt a dearer
Seaſon; by which good and prudent Oe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conomy,
thoſe Dearths which in their
turn have afflicted moſt other Countries,
fall but lightly upon their Common Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
               <p>On the contrary, when ſuch a Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
happens, they are able from their
Stores to aſſiſt other Nations; and tho'
we cannot go ſo high as<note n="*" place="margin">Vid. <hi>Sir</hi> Walter Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leigh'<hi>s</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains, <hi>p.</hi> 173.</note> Sir <hi>Walter Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leigh,</hi>
who is over large in his Compu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
of this Nature, and reckons the
<hi>Dutch</hi> to get an Immenſe Sum by this
ſort of Trade; yet 'tis apparent, That
they are very great Gainers from time to
time, by ſelling us our own Corn dear,
which they had bought cheap, and that
they make us pay very largely for its Store<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>room.</p>
               <p>A Nation that will get by Foreign Traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick,
muſt carefully watch all theſe things;
and the Inſtance we have here given, is a
great pull-back in the general Ballance of
Trade, and what the <hi>Dutch</hi> in this manner
Gain, is a dead Loſs to <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="85" facs="tcp:93970:61"/>
But this Evil is without doubt capable
of a Remedy. If they can afford to let
their Mony lie dead for a time, pay
Freight backward and forward, and Store<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>room,
and yet be Gainers by ſelling us
our own Commodity in a dearer Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket,
why ſhould not we think it worth
our while to build Granaries and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Store-houſes, within our own Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions?</p>
               <p>We take it, That Freight backward
and forward in ſuch a bulky Ware as
Corn is, does over Ballance the difference
in the Intereſt of Mony here and there:
So that we ſeem to be impos'd upon in
this important Matter, meerly through
that Negligence of which Wealthy Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
are but too Guilty.</p>
               <p>It may therefore be worth the Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
of ſuch as ſtudy the good of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
whither it would not be adviſeable,
and for the publick Welfare, to ſettle a
Fond for the erecting in every County
Granaries capable of containing ſuch a
quantity of Corn as may nouriſh the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
for a certain time, upon any emer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
occaſion, and as may hinder us at all
times from purchaſing at a dear Rate our
own Product from our more wary Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="86" facs="tcp:93970:62"/>
This firſt Step would be the moſt
chargeable, but in the Courſe of a few
Years, the Expence would be over-paid
to the Body of the Kingdom; as to filling
theſe Stores with Corn, ſufficient to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
the People's Occaſions, we are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clin'd
to think it would be beſt manag'd
by private Undertakers, whom the hopes
of Advantage will eaſily invite into ſuch
a Buſineſs. But here again will come
the common Objection made to publick
Things, That ſome private Men will be
thereby Gainers; and ſo, in the name of
God, let 'em, provided they do the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Service.</p>
               <p>However, there are many Reaſons to
think, That ſuch a Buſineſs, from the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Nature of it, would be more uncor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptly
manag'd, than moſt other publick
Matters. Firſt, Some Perſons would look
after it as a Work of more meritorious
Charity than any that can be thought on.
Secondly, In caſe of Male Adminiſtration,
the Clamors of the common People would
be irreſiſtable. Thirdly, A great many
different ſorts of Men would find them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
concern'd in point of Intereſt, to
ſee it well and juſtly adminiſter'd.</p>
               <p>'Tis not here pretended, to give any
regular Scheme of this whole Matter,
which would take up more time than
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:93970:62"/>
conſiſts with the brevity deſign'd in theſe
Diſcourſes; but 'tis hop'd, the Hints now
given, will ſuffice to make ſome good
Patriots in due ſeaſon lay to heart a buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of ſuch high Importance to their
Land, to its Product, and to the entire
Body of the People.</p>
               <p>That Corporation for ſetting the Poor
to Work, of which a Scheme has been
here propos'd, may very properly provide
Granaries round the Kingdom.</p>
               <p>It would likewiſe be very adviſeable to
review the Ancient Laws concerning
Corn, for they no ways ſquare with the
preſent Numbers of our People, nor with
the Growth of <hi>London,</hi> and indeed ought
to be more adapted to many other Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances
of the Times we now live
in.</p>
               <p>All Countries thrive or decline by
Trade, as they well or ill manage their
Product and Manufactures; and wiſe Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
obſerve carefully every part, where
they think to have any probable Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage.
If they excel in Product and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufacture,
as in <hi>France,</hi> the Government
bends it ſelf to encourage the People in
the purſuit of what is judg'd profitable to
the Publick. If they have little Product
of their own, as in <hi>Holland,</hi> they fall to
be Carriers of the World, and to buy
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:93970:63"/>
Goods in one place to vend in another,
whereby the Bulk of their Riches has been
gain'd.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>England</hi> has an Excellent Product of its
own, wherewith to ſuſtain its Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants:
The Woollen Manufacture is a
Wealth in a manner peculiar to us. We
have beſides the Product of other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
ſubject to our Dominion the <hi>Weſt-Indies.</hi>
The <hi>Eaſt-Indies</hi> are an inexhau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtible
Mine of Vanities, to barter for the
Vanities of other Countries, which a rich
Nation will always covet. We have
Ports and Situation, and every thing that
can contribute to make us the foremoſt
People of the whole Commercial World,
only a little Induſtry may be wanting,
which to ſtir up is the Drift of theſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries.</p>
               <p>We have look'd into Mr. <hi>King</hi>'s Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
of the Corn, becauſe it ſhould
be the Fundamental Care of a good Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
to provide that the People ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
want it, for two or three Years defect
there pulls down whatever the Merchant
has been doing for a long time.</p>
               <p>As to his Eſtimate of our live Stock
in Cattle, many Concluſions perhaps uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
may be form'd from it, which we
omit, as fearing to be too Voluminous:
We ſhall only obſerve, That it ſeems
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:93970:63"/>
more the National Intereſt of <hi>England,</hi>
to employ its Land to the Breeding and
Feeding of Cattle, than to the Produce of
Corn; For, as Mr. <hi>Fortrey</hi> has well noted,
<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>'s In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt and Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, p. 15.</note> 
                  <hi>The profit of one Acre of Paſture in the
Fleſh, Hide and Tallow of an Ox, or in the
Fleſh, Wool and Tallow of a Sheep, or in
the Carcaſe of a Horſe, is of ſo much grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
value abroad, than the like Yield of the
Earth would be in Corn; that the Exporta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of this Nation might be at leaſt double
to what it is, if rightly diſpos'd.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>'Tis true, in theſe Matters Men are
apt to follow what they think their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Profit, but the Influence of good
Laws would go a great way towards
inclining them more to purſue what is
for the general Advantage; and indeed
the private Concerns of Men ſhould be
always made ſubſervient to the Publick
Intereſt.</p>
               <p>Nor is force at all needful to bring this
about, for Men in moſt of their Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures,
where the Adminiſtration is wiſe
and ſteady, may be induc'd to purſue the
common Welfare by directive Laws, by
Examples from the Prince and great Ones,
and by ſome few not very expenſive En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements.
As for Example, 'tis in
the Power of a King of <hi>England,</hi> not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to have as many Horſes bred, but of
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:93970:64"/>
what Shape and Size He pleaſes; His
Encouragement will at any time increaſe
the Studds, and when He countenances
the Shape and Size that He thinks will
profit His Country moſt that way, the
Breeders will forthwith turn all their Care
and Induſtry.</p>
               <p>Our Anceſtors have not been unmindful
to promote the breed of Horſes, as we
may ſee by 27 <hi>H.</hi> 8. 6. 32 <hi>H.</hi> 8. 13. fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeing
what an Advantage might accrue
thereby to <hi>England;</hi> but thoſe old Laws
want reviſing, and to be more adapted to
preſent uſe.</p>
               <p>Our Fore-fathers indeed were againſt
tranſporting Horſes and Mares above ſuch
a value, 11 <hi>H.</hi> 7. 13. 1 <hi>Ed.</hi> 6. 5. but when
thoſe Prohibitions were enacted, the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs
of Trade was not ſo well under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood,
as it is at preſent. However, in
practice we have of late Years conſulted
our National Intereſt, which in all ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
is to let this Commodity be tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
for, as well as any other.</p>
               <p>It may be convenient to reſtrain the
carrying out of Mares, but as to Gueld<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
and Stone-horſes we can ſee no dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
in it. On the contrary, if ſuch Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
were call'd for, as would invite us to
increaſe our Breeds, it would no doubt
bring a great Profit to the Kingdom.
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:93970:64"/>
Stone-Horſes yield moſt abroad, and coſt
no more rearing than Gueldings: Againſt
this is objected, That we may thereby
ſtrengthen our Enemies, by mending the
Breed of other Countries; but there is lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
Strength added to that Enemy, whoſe
Mony we take for a periſhable Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity:
Beſides, the Nation we have moſt
Reaſon to diſtruſt, labour under a Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Impediment of not excelling in the
Breed of Horſes, their Ground is not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
for it. They do not want Stallions,
of which they may have as good, if not
better than Ours from other Parts, but
they have neither Mares nor fit Paſture;
and if they had Mares, they would be
yet to ſeek; for 'tis Notorious that the
Shape, Strength and Beauty of Horſes
proceed from the Soil; and when that is
chang'd, in the next Race they degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate.</p>
               <p>This Matter has been taken notice of,
becauſe it has been frequently deſir'd that
the ancient Prohibitions here mention'd
might be reinforc'd by ſome new Law;
but whether or no ſuch a Meaſure would
be right for <hi>England,</hi> is humbly ſubmitted
to better Judgments.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>King</hi> computes the Value of the
Horſes yearly bred to be about 250,000 <hi>l.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="92" facs="tcp:93970:65"/>
This Eſtimate ſeems not to be out of
the way, and from it we ſhall obſerve
that by good Laws and a due Care in their
Execution, and by Encouragement from
the great Ones above, it might peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
be brought about to double our year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Breed; and if this could be compaſs'd,
and if great Numbers of them ſhould be
ſold in Foreign Markets (provided it be
deem'd ſafe for the State) 'twould be a
new Addition to our National Stock, and
be juſt ſo much put into the Scale, yet
more to incline of our ſide the general Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance.</p>
               <p>Our Mines are another Product of the
Earth, and undoubtedly capable of great
Improvements; we ought to reſpect them
as the Parents of all our Trade, and
which made us known to the firſt Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants
of the World, the <hi>Phoenicians.</hi>
We have Tin, Lead, Copper, Calamy,
Iron, Coal, Culm, Allom, Copperas,
with other ſort of Minerals; and what
is in this manner dug out of the Earth,
cannot be a leſs Article than about 7 or
800,000 <hi>l. per Annum</hi> in the whole Ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
of the Kingdom.</p>
               <p>They who work theſe Mines and deal
in theſe Materials, know beſt what Laws
and Conſtitutions they want to make
their Buſineſs more eaſie at Home, and
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:93970:65"/>
to give their Commodities a freer Vent
Abroad; but if they need any Help from
the Legiſlative Power, moſt certainly they
ought to have it, ſince their Stock and
Labour turn ſo much to the Common
Good; for whatever their Product yields
in Foreign Markets, is clear National
Profit.</p>
               <p>There are lately publiſh'd ſome extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
Accompts of the Mines in <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diganſhire,</hi>
where 'tis ſaid there are Eight
large Veins of Silver, Lead and Copper
Oar, lying near together in one Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
nigh a Navigable River and a good
Port.<note n="*" place="margin">Mine Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture and Expedient, <hi>p.</hi> 7.</note> 'Tis alledg'd, That theſe Mines
with a large Stock, in a few Years, may be
advanc'd to a clear Profit of 170,000 <hi>l.
per Annum.</hi> This Computation does not
ſeem at all extravagant, to thoſe who
have look'd into the Accompts of what
Mines produce in other Countries, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
the Oar be good, the Vein like to
laſt (and large ones ſeldom fail) and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
there be no invincible Impediment
from Nature to their Working; they have
ſtood ſtill ſeveral Years for want of a good
Agreement among the Adventurers.</p>
               <p>'Tis ſaid Sir <hi>H. M.</hi> has put 'em in a
way of being wrought; but if his <hi>Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient</hi>
ſhould not ſucceed, and if new Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences
ſhould ariſe, the Legiſlative Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:93970:66"/>
may very well and juſtly inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
even to compel the Partners to ſome
Agreement, whereby the Work may be
carry'd on; for 'tis a Juſtice due to the
Publick at no time to ſuffer a few Stock-Jobbing
Citizens to ſtand in the way of
any National Advantage, the Fraud and
Corruption of which ſort of Men have
hurt <hi>England</hi> in more than one Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar.</p>
               <p>If theſe Mines come but any thing near
the Value Mr.<note place="margin">

                  </note> 
                  <hi>William Waller</hi> has put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them, and with Reaſons very proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
they are a fit Object of the States
Care; and upon Inſpection into their
true Worth, if private Purſes cannot raiſe
a Stock ſufficient to ſet 'em going, it were
better done upon ſome publick Fond, to
be repaid out of the Profits, than to loſe
what is repreſented as ſo immenſe a
Treaſure. But ſhould it prove leſs 'tis
not to be neglected, for Nations (like pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Men) who will thrive muſt look
into ſmall Things as well as great; and
for this we have the Examples of <hi>France</hi>
and <hi>Holland,</hi> whoſe Miniſters examine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the minuteſt Matters, where the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
may poſſibly Reap any Advantage;
and 'tis a very commendable piece of
Wiſdom, were it but for this ſingle Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
That to do ſo conſtantly begets a
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:93970:66"/>
Habit of Care and Diligence in things
of higher Importance.</p>
               <p>The Fiſhery ſhould be here treated of
as being the Product of the Peoples La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Vide</hi> Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes on the Publick Revenues and Trade, <hi>Part II. p.</hi> 135.</note>
but this Point we have elſewhere
handled. However, it falls naturally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
our preſent Subject to obſerve, That
to recover the Fiſhery, and to bring us
to the Height and Perfection our Coaſt
and Situation are capable of, would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe
the Numbers of our People (for
Men always multiply where they have
Conveniences of Living); It would find
Employment for the Poor; It would
raiſe Rents, and give a higher Value to all
that Land produces; It would ſet us right
in ſeveral Nations where we are believ'd
to deal at Loſs, and particularly in thoſe
Places where our Exportations bear no
Proportion, at leaſt in Bulk, with our Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portations,
which might be ſupply'd by
Fiſh. We cannot therefore but earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
recommend the ſerious Thoughts of
this Matter, and by what Methods it
may be retriev'd, to all ſuch as love their
Country, and who wiſh to ſee us every
Year more and more Gainers in the Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance
of Trade.</p>
               <p>Having touch'd upon theſe Heads, we
ſhall proceed to ſay ſomething of Wooll,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:93970:67"/>
which is a main Article in the Produce
of Land.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>King</hi> computes the Value of the
Wooll ſhorn, to be about 2,000,000 <hi>l.
per Annum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And in the Diſcourſes upon the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue
and Trade,<note place="margin">Part II. p. 414.</note> we compute, by a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Medium, That the Material is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd
one with another, four-fold in the
Workmanſhip; ſo that the Value of the
Woollen Manufacture made here, may
amount to 8,000,000 <hi>l. per Annum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Perhaps neither of us are much out of
the way in theſe two Calculations, but
ſuppoſe us a little under or over the Mark,
all People will agree with us, That this
Branch of our Product is very large, and
of the higheſt Importance.</p>
               <p>The Writer of theſe Papers has an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt
from a Perſon, upon whoſe Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and Experience in theſe Matters
there is great Reaſon to rely, That our
Exports of all kinds, in the Woollen Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufacture,
amount to above two Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions
<hi>per Annum;</hi> which is ſo large a Part
of our General Exportation, that it muſt
maim the whole Body of our Trade, to
receive any Hurt in ſo principal a Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.</p>
               <p>Whatever Goods we make up of Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
Materials, and ſell in the Markets
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:93970:67"/>
abroad all above the Coſt of the Materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als
is clear Gain to <hi>England;</hi> in the ſame
manner all our clear Returns from the
Plantations which we Export are Neat
Profit.</p>
               <p>But where the Materials and Manufa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures
too are both our own, as in this
inſtance of the Woollen Goods, two Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions
carry'd out when the general Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance
of Trade is conſider'd, muſt be
eſteem'd as two Millions gain'd to the
Kingdom; for the Return of this Expor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
ſupplies our Conſumption of Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
Goods (which would otherwiſe be
bought with Mony) with ſome Overplus,
which Overplus is what muſt incline the
Scale to turn of our ſide.</p>
               <p>Some People have been apt to fear that
we ſink in the Woollen Manufacture, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the Accompts of the fine Draparies
exported, have been heretofore larger than
of late Years; but ſuch do not contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate,
that tho' the Old may have leſſen'd,
what is commonly call'd the New Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paries
have increas'd, conſiſting in Bays,
Serges and Stuffs: So that upon the whole,
infinitely more of the Material of Wooll
has of late Years been wrought up for Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
uſe than in former Times; and
herein our Merchants have been only
forc'd to follow the Modes and Humor
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:93970:68"/>
of thoſe People with whom they deal,
and the Courſe they have perſued has hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto
not been detrimental to the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick.</p>
               <p>Nor is there any Cauſe to apprehend,
but that we may increaſe from time to
time in the general Manufacture of Wooll,
tho' the Exportation of particular Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities
may now and then vary: For
upon the whole, our Material is better and
fitter for all uſes than that of moſt Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries.</p>
               <p>'Twere better indeed that the Call from
abroad were only for the fine Draparies,
becauſe then we ſhould be in a manner
without a Rival; no Country but <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
and <hi>Ireland,</hi> having a Soard or Turf,
that will rear Sheep, producing the Wooll
of which moſt of our Draparies are made.
'Tis true, the Wooll of <hi>Spain</hi> is fine a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
all others, but 'tis the wear only
of the Richer Sort; and of <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Cloaths
not above 9000 Pieces are ſent abroad
<hi>Communibus Annis.</hi> And even in the
working up of this Wooll, perhaps it
may be made out, that our very Climate
gives us an Advantage over other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries.</p>
               <p>The Learned Prelate, who has oblig'd
<hi>England</hi> with that Noble Work, his
<hi>Hiſtory of the Reformation,</hi> Diſcourſing
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:93970:68"/>
once upon theſe Matters, with the Writer
of this Eſſay, did urge a thing of which
the Philoſophy ſeem'd very ſound and
right, and upon which we have ſince re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected
often; He ſaid, That Nature had
adapted different Countries for different
Manufactures; that cold and moiſter
Climates are fitter for the working up
of Wool, becauſe there the Sun does not
exhauſt its natural Moiſture, nor make
it brittle, which would render it ill to
work, and bad to wear; That hot Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates
are beſt for the working up of Silk,
becauſe the Matter is there more diſpos'd
to imbibe the Dye, and to take a more
durable impreſſion of it, the Sun helping,
at the ſame time, both to preſerve and to
give it Luſtre.</p>
               <p>That we have many natural Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages
over all Foreign Nations, who ſhall
pretend to ſet up Looms, is beyond all
diſpute; but 'tis a very great Queſtion,
whither there are not weighty Reaſons
to apprehend Neighbours of another ſort,
we mean the People of <hi>Ireland.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Country is very large, it abounds
in convenient Ports; 'tis excellently Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuate
for Trade, capable of great Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements
of all kinds, and able to nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh
more than treble its preſent Number
of Inhabitants.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="100" facs="tcp:93970:69"/>
Its Soil, Soard and Turf, are in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
the ſame with ours, and proper to
rear Sheep: All which Conſiderations be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
a reaſonable fear, that in time they
may come to rival us in our Darling and
moſt Important Manufacture.</p>
               <p>That they ſhould increaſe in People,
that their Land ſhould be drein'd and
meliorated, that they ſhould have Trade,
and grow Wealthy by it, may not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure
be dangerous to <hi>England:</hi> For
'tis granted, their Riches will center at laſt
here in their Mother-Kingdom.</p>
               <p>And Colonies that enjoy not only Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection,
but who are at their Eaſe, and
Flouriſh, will in all likelyhood be leſs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinable
to inovate, or to receive a Foreign
Yoke, than if they are harraſs'd and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell'd
to Poverty, through the hard Uſage
of the People from whom they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd.
For tho' there are now and then
Inſtances of Countries that rebel wanton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
yet moſt commonly great Defections
proceed from great Oppreſſion.</p>
               <p>It ſeems therefore a Point of the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
Wiſdom to give the Planters of <hi>Ireland</hi>
all Encouragements that can poſſibly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt
with the Welfare of <hi>England:</hi> For 'tis
an Out-work to the Seat of Empire here,
if it ſhould be gain'd by any Neighbouring
Power, the Sum of Affairs would be put
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:93970:69"/>
in danger. 'Tis to be preſerv'd but by
a Numerous Army, or by its own pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
Strength. How far the firſt way
may affect our Liberties is not difficult to
determin, it follows then that the ſafeſt
Courſe muſt be to let them thrive by
Husbandry, and ſome Trade, whereby the
Natives and Inhabitants will not only
have the Means, but an Intereſt to defend
themſelves.</p>
               <p>If through a miſtaken fear and jealouſy
of their future Strength and Greatneſs,
we ſhould either permit or contrive to let
them be diſpeopled, poor, weak and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pirited,
or if we ſhould render them ſo
uneaſie as to incline the People to a deſire
of Change, it may invite Strangers to look
that way; and if brought to be naked and
defenceleſs, they muſt be a Prey to the
firſt Invader.</p>
               <p>This will be avoided, if they are ſuffer'd
to proſper, and not only ſo, but Strength
thus added to one Member will make the
Body-Politick much the ſtronger.</p>
               <p>For as all the Blood with a ſwift Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
paſſes frequently through the Heart,
ſo whatever Wealth out Countries ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire,
circulates about, coming into the
chief Seat of Empire, from whence 'tis
diſpers'd into all its Parts; and ever ſince
<hi>Ireland</hi> did improve, it can be made ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:93970:70"/>
                  <hi>England</hi> has had no ſmall Proportion
of its Gains.</p>
               <p>What made <hi>Rome</hi> ſo immenſly rich?
Her Citizens but little minded Arts or
Handicraft, War was their chief Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
'Twas counted Ignoble in a Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
to exerciſe Merchandize, nor indeed
was the Genius of the People adicted to
it, but being the Head of that large Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion,
the Fountain of Law, and the
Spring from whence all Power, Honors,
and Magiſtracies were deriv'd, thither all
Men reſorted; ſome for Pleaſure, others
upon Buſineſs: So that what was got by
the <hi>Sicilians, Rhodians, Cretans,</hi> and by
the Trading Cities, not only of <hi>Greece</hi> but
<hi>Aſia,</hi> came at laſt to center there.</p>
               <p>But this holds more ſtrongly, where
the Seat of Dominion is in a great Empo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rium,
for ſuch a City will not only be
the Head of Power but of Trade, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning
all its Branches, and giving the
Rules and Price; ſo that all Parts there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
depending, can deal but ſubordinate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to it, till at laſt 'tis found that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces
work but to enrich the Superior
Kingdom.</p>
               <p>That what has been here ſaid is true,
in our preſent Caſe, appears manifeſtly
from this, That all People agree, there is
not in <hi>Ireland</hi> above 500,000 <hi>l.</hi> in current
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:93970:70"/>
Caſh, notwithſtanding their large Expor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
for many Years, which could not
be, if they had not ſome conſtant Drein,
whereby they are exhauſted. 'Tis true,
improving Countries lay out a great Stock
in Foreign Materials for Building, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
ſo that they ſeldom abound much at firſt
in the Species of Mony, but allowing for
this; yet in the natural Courſe of Things
they ought to have more Species, if what
they got elſewhere had not been ſpent
here, and return'd hither by Bills of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change
from <hi>Holland, France, Spain,</hi> the
<hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> and other Places.</p>
               <p>But tho' we are ready to agree, That
hitherto their Gains both at home and
abroad have chiefly center'd here; yet in
proceſs of time, 'tis poſſible that in the
Management of their Product and Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
Traffick, they may come to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fere
with, and bring Prejudice to their
Mother-Nation. And remote Fears be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
allowable where the whole Safety of a
State is concern'd, they ſhould not won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to ſee <hi>England</hi> ſo much alarm'd at the
Progreſs they make in the Woollen Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufacture.</p>
               <p>As has been ſaid before, 'Tis ſo great
a Part of our Exportation, that any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable
Failure and Interruption therein
muſt ſet the Ballance of Trade againſt us
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:93970:71"/>
with a Witneſs; it falls therefore natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
into our preſent Subject to ſay ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of this Matter.</p>
               <p>Laſt Seſſion of Parliament, a Bill paſs'd
the Houſe of Commons, and was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
in the Houſe of Lords, For Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibiting
the Exportation of the Wool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len
Manufactures of <hi>Ireland</hi> to Foreign
Parts.</p>
               <p>This Point has of late been much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated,
and the general Subject of Men's
Diſcourſes; The Writer of theſe Papers
was then inclin'd to the milder Side, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
indeed in his Judgment againſt Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibitions,
becauſe moſt of ſuch as are
come within his Obſervation, ſeem to
have been puſh'd on (without Doors) ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
for private Ends, and to ſerve ſome
particular Turn, than calculated to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
any publick Benefit.</p>
               <p>But having now more maturely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider'd
this nice Controverſie, he begins
to lean to their Opinion, who think ſuch
a Bill neceſſary; and more eſpecially if the
Promoters of it can make out the Sugge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions
upon which it was founded.</p>
               <p>Where the Common-wealth is truly
concern'd, and where her Safety is in
Queſtion, they have very narrow Minds,
who let their Compaſſion be too much
extended to private Objects: Our chief
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:93970:71"/>
Tenderneſs ſhould be towards her, and
rough Examples in the infancy of a Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief
are rather merciful than cruel, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
fewer People ſuffer then, than would
otherwiſe do, if the Evil were permitted
to take deeper Root.</p>
               <p>If their Manufactures interfere with
ours, ſo as to hurt <hi>England,</hi> it muſt be
undoubtedly adviſeable to intercept their
Growth by ſome effectual Law betimes,
before ſuch an Error in Government grow
too big for our Correction; before too
many Families have turn'd their Stock
that way; before they have increas'd their
Stock of Sheep, or bred up too great a
number of Artiſts (all which Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
would make their Caſe yet harder);
for we ſhould preſerve our ſelves with as
little Hurt to them as poſſible.</p>
               <p>But it ſeems, ſome People make a
doubt, whither or no we have Power
thus to intermeddle in their Matters;
queſtioning whether Laws made here are
binding upon them, till they have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
a Sanction in their own Parliament.
And Mr. <hi>Molyneux</hi> counts it a very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant
Notion, that has not the leaſt
Colour from Reaſon or Record, to term
them a Colony from <hi>England.</hi> But we
muſt beg leave to differ with him in Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.
For we take them ſo far to be a
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:93970:72"/>
Colony in the Senſe (by the Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
both of Law and Reaſon) as renders
them ſtill dependant upon their Mother-Kingdom.</p>
               <p>Nor is this at all impugn'd by the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſions
made to the ancient <hi>Iriſh</hi> by <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>
the 2d, King <hi>John,</hi> and <hi>Henry</hi> the 3d;
but to ſet this in a better Light, the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture
of <hi>Ireland</hi> in thoſe Times muſt be
conſider'd.</p>
               <p>The firſt Adventurers that went over
thither, namely, <hi>Richard</hi> the Son of
<hi>Strongbow,</hi> and <hi>Robert Fitz-Stephen,</hi> who
ſtipulated under certain Conditions to aſſiſt
<hi>Dermot Fitz-Murchard,</hi> had not a ſtrength
ſufficient to reduce the Country, and
little was done towards it of any Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,
till the Expedition of <hi>Henry</hi> the
2d, <hi>Anno</hi> 1172. with a Royal Army, to
whom the Clergy, Nobility, Gentry and
People, made an abſolute Surrender of the
Kingdom; and, by the deſcription Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians
give of it, it ſeems to have been
that ſort of Yielding which the <hi>Romans</hi>
call'd <hi>Deditio,</hi> which was <hi>ſe dare in Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus
Poteſtatem &amp; Arbitrium.</hi> And their
giving themſelves up to <hi>Henry</hi> the 2d,
without a Battel or Blood-ſhed, gave him
yet a ſtronger Title, becauſe the Act was
leſs conſtrain'd, and more flowing from
the Will. 'Tis true, ſo wild and nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:93970:72"/>
a People were not to be kept in Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
by a handful of new Inhabitants; the
King therefore gave them a Conſtitution,
by which they were to govern themſelves,
as a free Country under him their Lord.
After this, the Dominion thereof was ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled
upon <hi>John</hi> his Youngeſt Son, and
two and twenty Years after in him re-united
to the Crown of <hi>England.</hi> From
King <hi>John, Henry</hi> the 3d, and their Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors,
the ancient <hi>Iriſh</hi> and the firſt Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venturers
(of whom many as<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Edmund Spencer</hi>'s View of the State of <hi>Ireland,</hi> p. 222.</note> Mr. <hi>Spen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer</hi>
has obſerv'd, have taken the Names,
Manners and Humours of the Natives)
derive ſeveral Franchiſes and Immunities,
and among the reſt to hold a Parliament.
The Story of thoſe Times is it ſelf dark,
but the Reaſon of their Councils is yet
darker. From <hi>Mathew Paris,</hi> and <hi>Giral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus
Cambrenſis</hi> it appears, That theſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſions
were made to the Body of the Old
<hi>Iriſh,</hi> tho' but few, in Practice, ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to them; for to uſe Mr. <hi>Spencer</hi>'s own
Words, <hi>To whom did King</hi> Henry <hi>the</hi> 2<hi>d
impoſe thoſe Laws? Not to the</hi> Iriſh, <hi>for the
moſt of them fled from his Power into Deſarts
and Mountains, leaving the wide Country to
the Conquerour, who in their ſtead eftſoons
plac'd</hi> Engliſh <hi>Men, who poſſeſs'd all their
Lands, and did quite ſhut out the</hi> Iriſh, <hi>or
the moſt part of them. And to thoſe new
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:93970:73"/>
Inhabitants and Colonies he gave his Laws,
to wit, the ſame Laws under which they were
born and bred, the which it was no difficulty
to place among them, being formerly well in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ur'd
thereunto; unto whom afterwards there
repair'd divers of the Poor distreſs'd People
of the</hi> Iriſh, <hi>for Succour and Relief of whom,
ſuch as they thought fit for Labour, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtriouſly
diſpos'd, as the moſt part of their
baſer ſort are, they receiv'd unto them as
their Vaſſals, but ſcarcely vouchſaf'd to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
unto them the benefit of thoſe Laws, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
which themſelves liv'd, but every One
made his Will and Commandment a Law un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his own Vaſſal: Thus was not the Law
of</hi> England <hi>ever properly apply'd unto the</hi>
Iriſh <hi>Nation, as by a purpos'd Plot of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
but as they could inſinuate and
ſteal themſelves under the ſame, by their hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Carriage and Submiſſion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But after this, during the Wars be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Houſe of <hi>York</hi> and <hi>Lancaſter,</hi>
they ſhook off both the Rule and Laws of
<hi>England,</hi> repoſſeſſing their ancient Seats,
driving us by degrees to that which was
properly call'd the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Pale.</p>
               <p>In truth it does not appear, That they
embrac'd our Form of Government for a
great while: So that the Models of it given
heretofore, from hence ſeem chiefly to
have been intended for the better Rule of
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:93970:73"/>
our own People, not but they were like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
meant as a Benefit to the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> if
they would be contented to become a more
civiliz'd Nation.</p>
               <p>If their ancient Parliament Rolls were
extant, it would more plainly appear what
uſe they made of their Conſtitution, and
thereby it would be ſeen whither or no
both their Houſe of Lords and Commons
did not chiefly conſiſt of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</p>
               <p>If, as Mr. <hi>Molyneux</hi> aſſerts, Ireland,
<hi>tho' annext to the Crown of</hi> Fngland, <hi>has
always been look'd upon to be a Kingdom com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat
within it ſelf, and to have all Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
to an Abſolute Kingdom belonging,
and Subordinate to no Legiſlative Authority
on Earth;</hi> theſe Immunities muſt be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd
from the Conceſſions granted at
<hi>Caſhal</hi> by <hi>Henry</hi> the 2d. But with whom
was this Compact made? With the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
<hi>Iriſh;</hi> and their Claim to it would
be very juſt, if they had perform'd the
Conditions of the Stipulation, but their
Title ſeems weaken'd by 52 Rebellions
which they have made againſt the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of <hi>England.</hi> We would not be
thought here to inſinuate, that a People
may loſe their Natural Rights by an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection
againſt their Prince, but cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Priviledges not Fundamental, they
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:93970:74"/>
may forfeit by non-uſure or miſ-uſure.
Beſides, the Caſe between a Prince and
his Native Subjects, and between a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
and the People of a Conquer'd
Country, is quite different. In the firſt
Inſtance the Relation is the ſame, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
a Father and a Son, the Child may
Err, and the Parent will forgive; but
in the other Caſe the Tie is not the ſame,
they are not ſo near a-Kin. 'Tis true,
the Prince is Father of the People, in one
place as well as in the other, but in his
Politick-Capacity he is at the Head of
another Common-wealth, with whoſe
Blood and Treaſure the ſtranger Country
was perhaps conquer'd. And if a Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
People, thus ſubdu'd, Rebel, they
may without doubt forfeit certain Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges,
which were not any Natural
Rights of their own, but Forms of liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
preſcrib'd, and Conceſſions granted
by the Conquerors. And the <hi>Romans</hi> in
the beſt and pureſt Times of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth,
did frequently deprive Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
Cities and Countries, rebelling, of
their Land, and of their Immunities: To
be a State not Subordinate to any Legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlative
Authority on Earth, is a Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
that may be forfeited by a Subject-Country,
and yet leave to the People their
Natural Rights unhurt: That the <hi>Iriſh</hi>
                  <pb n="111" facs="tcp:93970:74"/>
were once a Subject-Country, appears
from the intire Reſignation of themſelves
to <hi>Henry</hi> the 2d, as Head of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth
of <hi>England.</hi> To reduce a
wild Nation, it was expedient to put their
Liberties upon a good Foot. He reſtor'd
them therefore to be a free People, and
ſo they and their Deſcendants might have
been. They might have continu'd an
Independant Kingdom, and the Old <hi>Iriſh</hi>
might have preſerv'd both their Land, and
the Immunities thereon depending, if they
had not themſelves alter'd their own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution.</p>
               <p>But by Rebelling frequently, and by
being as often Vanquiſh'd, they chang'd
their own Form of Government. They
were heretofore Proprietors of the Land,
and therefore had Right to be the two
Eſtates in Parliament of Lords and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
but this was by degrees loſt, and
became veſted in the new Inhabitants:
Inſomuch that, to uſe Mr. <hi>Molyneux</hi>'s own
Words, <hi>Now 'tis manifeſt, That the great
Body of the preſent People of</hi> Ireland, <hi>are
the Progeny of the</hi> Engliſh <hi>and</hi> Britains,
<hi>that from time to time have come over into
this Kingdom; and there remains but a meer
handful of the ancient</hi> Iriſh <hi>at this Day, I
may ſay not One in a Thouſand.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="112" facs="tcp:93970:75"/>
Are the Conceſſions granted by King
<hi>Henry</hi> now veſted in this Thouſandth
Part? And are they the Body-Politick of
<hi>Ireland,</hi> of which not One in a Thouſand
ſits in Parliament; and of which very
few have Voices in chooſing thoſe who
are to ſit there? If any, theſe certainly
are to be the diſtinct State, and <hi>To have
all Juriſdiction to an Abſolute Kingdom be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing,</hi>
for with their Anceſtors thoſe
Stipulations were made, under which Mr.
<hi>Molyneux</hi> pretends to claim.</p>
               <p>But the Old Inhabitants having loſt
the greateſt part of their Property, have
loſt ſo much of their ſhare in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution,
which is now devolv'd upon
thoſe Colonies which <hi>England</hi> has from
time to time ſent to conquer and poſſeſs
the Land, who are now properly the Body-Politick
of that Kingdom.</p>
               <p>Theſe we allow have forfeited nothing
by any Rebellion the Natives have made,
they are Purchaſers, and at a dear Rate
with the frequent hazard of their Lives
and Fortunes: We muſt therefore ſee how
far the ancient Rights of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volv'd
upon them, and whither under
that Claim the New Inhabitants may
juſtly term themſelves an Independant
Nation.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="113" facs="tcp:93970:75"/>
Whoever Conquers, Conquers in the
Right of that Country at whoſe Expence
the War was made; and tho' the Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the Land be often granted to the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venturers,
the Dominion thereof is always
reſerv'd to the Nation that ſends her Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
out. 'Tis true, where a part of the
People divides its ſelf from the reſt to ſeek
new Seats at their own Coſt, as they did
among the <hi>Scythians, Goths</hi> and <hi>Vandals,</hi>
there the Caſe was otherwiſe, for they
rambled ſo far as no more to communicate
with their Mother-Country.</p>
               <p>But it does not appear, That <hi>Fitz-Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phen</hi>
or <hi>Richard Strongbow,</hi> went out upon
ſuch Terms as thoſe Northern Nations
did. On the contrary, their Endeavours
had little Succeſs till ſeconded by the
Power of <hi>England,</hi> at whoſe Expence all
the ſucceeding Conqueſts of <hi>Ireland</hi> have
been either made or ſecur'd; ſo that if the
ancient <hi>Iriſh</hi> had any Rights of Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
and if thoſe Rights are forfeited,
the Forfeiture devolves upon <hi>England,</hi> and
not upon the Adventurers, nor their Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors.</p>
               <p>Nor is it indeed conſiſtant with the
Principles of Government that a part of
the People ſhould ſeparate from the reſt,
and be (eſpecially ſo near at hand) an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependant
Dominion, for that were to
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:93970:76"/>
have Protection where they owe no Duty,
which is an Abſurdity in Politicks.</p>
               <p>When a part of the People divides
from the reſt to ſeek more Territory, if
they are at their own Coſt, and ſtrong
enough to eradicate or keep under the
Natives, they become a New Empire,
and may be juſtly term'd a diſtinct Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
But if not at their own Expence,
and if they are weak and always ſtand in
need of being protected by their Mother-Country,
they are in all appearance to be
accounted but as a Colony.</p>
               <p>Nor are Names to alter the Nature of
Things. 'Tis granted <hi>Ireland</hi> has been
very anciently call'd a Kingdom, though
our Princes did not take the Stile of
Kings thereof till the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the
8th. 'Tis likewiſe apparent, That they
have many diſtinct Juriſdictions; That
they are a State within themſelves; That
they have an undoubted Right to hold
Parliaments; but all this does not hinder
them from being ſtill a Colony, nor can
it make them an Independant Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
               <p>Almoſt every Colony that the <hi>Romans</hi>
planted was a Model of their own Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick,<note place="margin">Sigonii Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taria.</note>
and fram'd according to it, by
thoſe whom the Senate had deputed for its
Settlement. They had an Annual <hi>Duum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viratus,</hi>
                  <pb n="115" facs="tcp:93970:76"/>
in Imitation of the Conſular Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.
They had likewiſe <hi>Cenſors,
Aediles</hi> and <hi>Quoeſtors;</hi> and which comes
ſtrongeſt to our preſent Caſe, every Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony
had its particular Senate: But will
any one pretend to argue from thence,
That all theſe were Diſtinct and Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendant
Common-wealths?</p>
               <p>Theſe Branches and Scions from the
great Trunk of the Republick, had all of
'em the Face of Formal Governments;
they had Magiſtracies and Councils, Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of Life and Death, and to raiſe Mony
for their Common Safety, and to make
Laws for their better Rule; but this is no
Argument that they had all the Parts of
Sovereign Empire.</p>
               <p>'Tis true the Inhabitants of <hi>Ireland,</hi>
from ancient Conceſſions, have a Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge
perhaps above the <hi>Roman</hi> Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,
namely, to Tax themſelves by their
own Suffrages, within their own Limits;
but this is no more than what is claim'd
by ſeveral Provinces of <hi>France,</hi> which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs
account themſelves ſubordinate
to the Sovereign Power of the whole
State.</p>
               <p>There is a part of Empire not commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicable,
and which muſt reſide Sovereign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſomewhere; for there would be ſuch a
perpetual claſhing of Power and Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:93970:77"/>
as were inconſiſtant with the
very Being of Communities, unleſs this
laſt Reſort were ſomewhere lodg'd. Now
this Incommunicable Power we take to
be the Supream Judgment of what is beſt
and moſt expedient for the whole; and in
all Reaſon of Government this ought to
be there truſted and lodged, from whence
Protection is expected.</p>
               <p>That <hi>Ireland</hi> ſhould judge of what is
beſt for it ſelf, is juſt and fair; but in
Determinations that are to reach the
whole, as namely, what is moſt expedient
for <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> both, there, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
all doubt, the Supream Judgment
ought to reſt in the King, Lords, and
Commons of <hi>England,</hi> by whoſe Arms
and Treaſure <hi>Ireland</hi> ever was, and muſt
always be defended.</p>
               <p>Nor is this any claiming the ſame Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire

                     <hi>Caſe of</hi> Ireland, p. 84.</note> as Mr. <hi>Molyneux</hi> would
ſuggeſt, for there is no Parity of Reaſon

it ſelf by different Laws, tho' under

Confederated with the Realm of

protect them we do, as the Strongeſt Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies

this puts 'em not in the Degree of Subor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination

               <p>Their Inferior Rule and Juriſdictions
are not diſputed, but that Super-eminent
Dominion and ſupream and uncontrol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable
Regiment over themſelves, which
they pretend to, is neither ſafe for <hi>England</hi>
to grant, nor for them to ask.</p>
               <p>Such a Power would be dangerous, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
by ſome Accident it may come to be
ſo exercis'd, as to be their and our
Ruin.</p>
               <p>We have had bad Kings, and thoſe
Kings have had evil Counſellors: Suppoſe
us then, in ſome future Age, under ſuch
Circumſtances, as to have a Prince and
his Council ſo angry with the People, as
to deſire their Deſtruction, which was
our Caſe once with King <hi>John,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mat. Pariſ.</note> who
would have ſold us to the <hi>Moors</hi> to wreak
his own Diſcontents. And ſuppoſe this
Prince willing to ſet up <hi>Ireland</hi> in oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to this Kingdom, may not a Prince,
ſo diſpos'd, give the Royal Aſſent to Laws
in <hi>Ireland,</hi> that would utterly deſtroy
<hi>England?</hi> And what Remedy would
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:93970:78"/>
                  <hi>Poining</hi>'s Act be in ſuch a Juncture? In
a Caſe like this, what way have the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of <hi>England</hi> to preſerve themſelves, but
to repreſent their Grievance to the Prince?
Who, when he ſees the Error of his
Council, may be induc'd to join in ſome
Supream Exerciſe of the Legiſlature here,
coercive, and ſuch as may keep <hi>Ireland</hi> in
the degree of Subordination, that ſeems
requiſite to the well-being of both Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               <p>Suppoſe a Prince bent to hurt <hi>England,</hi>
ſhould give his Aſſent to a Law there,
That the <hi>Iriſh</hi> may tranſport all their
Wool to Foreign Countries; would not
this, as they ſay, cut the Turf from un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
our Feet, and at one blow, in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
ruin all our Woollen Manufactures?
There are many other Inſtances, in which,
if they were indulg'd, the greateſt part of
our Traffick would be carry'd to their
Ports.</p>
               <p>In Matters of Trade, even the beſt of
Kings may be ſurpris'd, of which we have
a late Example; and the ill Conſequences
the <hi>Scotch</hi> Act will probably have, ought
to make us very watchful over what our
Neighbours do, eſpecially where they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
upon us.</p>
               <p>That the greateſt part of the preſent
Inhabitants of <hi>Ireland,</hi> chiefly thoſe who
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:93970:78"/>
claim the Land-Property, are a Colony
from <hi>England,</hi> has been here peradventure
ſufficiently made out; and we take it to
be their beſt Hold, to be always ſo ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compted,
becauſe it gives them a laſting
Title to be protected and defended by us.
And if they are a Colony, it would be a
ſtrange Defect in our Conſtitution, if we
wanted any of the Powers requiſite to
purſue the Ends of Government, of which
the Principal is to take care, that no one
part of the People be permitted to hurt
the other; but if the Legiſlature of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
cannot, in Important Matters, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain
that of <hi>Ireland, Ireland</hi> is at leaſt in
a Capacity to ruin <hi>England,</hi> which would
make our Form of Government at one
and the ſame time Ridiculous and Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous.</p>
               <p>But to be thus out of our Juriſdiction,
would in the Concluſion be as fatal to
them as to us; for tho' they ſhould grow
Rich at our Expence, and tho' a large
part of our Trade were diverted thither,
they would not yet be able to ſubſiſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone,
and by themſelves. And if we by
Loſs of our Trade become weaken'd, how
can we give them that Aſſiſtance which
from time to time they have always want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed?
So that this diviſion of Strength
would be deſtructive to both Countries.
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:93970:79"/>
It muſt therefore be their Intereſt as well
as Ours, That the Supream Power, and
the chief Wealth, ſhould be ever preſerv'd
to Center here in the Seat of Empire.</p>
               <p>Upon the whole Matter, it ſeems the
Right of <hi>England,</hi> and as well for the
Benefit of <hi>Ireland</hi> its beſt and nobleſt
Colony, that the Legiſlative Authority
here ſhould upon all Emergencies, make
ſuch Regulations and Reſtrictions, relating
to Trade eſpecially, as ſhall be thought for
the Weal-Publick of both Countries.</p>
               <p>And having premis'd theſe Things, we
ſhall proceed to handle more cloſely the
Subject of our Queſtion; namely, Whither
it is neceſſary to Prohibit by Law, the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portation
of Woollen Manufacture from
<hi>Ireland</hi> to Foreign Parts?</p>
               <p>To put an early Stop to their turning
their Stock and Induſtry this way, appears
requiſite for many Reaſons.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>Ireland</hi> contains near a half as
much Territory as <hi>England,</hi> and the Soil
being of the ſame Nature, may be brought
to produce near a half as much Wool as
<hi>England</hi> yields; and this Material being
the Baſis upon which our Trade is built,
they who can come near us in it, will
come juſt ſo near us in our Trade a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="121" facs="tcp:93970:79"/>
Secondly, Countries thinly Peopled,
can ſooner improve in the Breed of Cattle,
than any other way, becauſe 'tis a Work
which a few Hands may manage.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Where there is Plenty of a
Material, which, Manufactur'd, yields a
good Price, Hands will ſoon be invited
over to work it up.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, But this holds more ſtrongly,
where not only the Material, but all ſort
of Proviſions are cheap; and in Countries
which have not been yet improv'd, where
every new Commer hopes to make a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
Fortune.</p>
               <p>From which Poſitions it follows, If
<hi>Ireland</hi> be permitted to proceed in the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portation
of Woollen Goods,</p>
               <p>Firſt, That in no long Courſe of time
they may come to carry out to the value
of a Million <hi>per Annum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, That the cheapneſs of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
will enable them to afford their
Commodities cheaper than <hi>England</hi> can do
in Foreign Markets.</p>
               <p>All that have either writ or ſpoke
upon this Subject, agree, That the
whole Controverſie turns upon this ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
Point, whither they can make the
ſame Woollen Goods cheaper there than
here.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="122" facs="tcp:93970:80"/>
To ſet this in a true Light, we muſt
conſider the firſt Material, and thoſe who
work it up.</p>
               <p>As to the firſt Material, beyond all
doubt Wooll is a third cheaper there than
in <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As to the Workmanſhip, the Clothiers
affirm Spinning to be one half of it, and
that of all Hands is agreed to be cheaper
there than here. And for the Combing
and Weaving, the Price of courſe muſt
abate, as Work-men increaſe; for Handy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft
in Countries, where Living is cheap,
can be dear no longer than till Artiſts
are bred up. And a great many Artiſts
will be inſtructed before the Multitude of
Inhabitants can render Proviſions dear in
ſuch a Place as <hi>Ireland.</hi> But to judge
rightly of theſe Matters, we muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>template
the Body of the People in each
Country.</p>
               <p>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Political Anatomy of <hi>Ireland,</hi> p. 76.</note> Sir <hi>William Petty</hi> affirms, That the
Inferior Rank of People in <hi>Ireland</hi> (thro'
whoſe Hands Spinning muſt paſs) do not
expend one with another above 52 Shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings
<hi>per</hi> Head. The Expence of the
ſame Rank cannot be leſs here than 5 <hi>l.
per</hi> Head.</p>
               <p>'Tis an undeniable Truth, That the
Common Proviſions for Life are one half
cheaper there than here: 'Tis likewiſe
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:93970:80"/>
as plain, That Meat and Drink are one
half of Mankind's Expence reckon'd in a
Maſs together. And theſe Advantages of
Living, muſt enable them to afford the
ſame Commodity cheaper than we can do,
where not only our Numbers make Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions
dear, but where new Exciſes give
all things of our Home-Conſumption yet
a higher Price.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Clement</hi>'s (for we take him to be
the Author of<note n="*" place="margin">Intereſt of <hi>England,</hi> with Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Trade of <hi>Ireland.</hi>
                  </note> that Fine Diſcourſe upon
this Subject, inſcrib'd to the Marquiſs of
<hi>Normanby</hi>) makes this Judicious Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<hi>That if any one offers his Goods cheaper
than the uſual Price, that will then become
the Market Price; and every one elſe muſt
ſell at the ſame, or keep his Goods.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Cheapneſs of Living, and all other
Circumſtances conſider'd, it ſeems very
probable, That if they ſhould come to
have the neceſſary Complement of Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
and to flouriſh in this Manufacture,
they will be able to ſell it one third cheaper
than we can do.</p>
               <p>If they can make for a Million, and
afford it by one third cheaper than we,
it follows, That at leaſt one half of our
Exportations in that Commodity muſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
determin.</p>
               <p>And the Conſequence of this would
be, That Rents muſt every where fall.
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:93970:81"/>
The Purchaſe of Land muſt ſink. The
Poor muſt want Employment, and grow
upon us; half our Foreign Trade muſt
forthwith ceaſe, and in the other half,
we muſt be Loſers in the Ballance, which
is chiefly kept of our Side by the Woollen
Manufactures.</p>
               <p>Not only a third, but an Abatement
of ten <hi>per Cent.</hi> forc'd upon us, by the
Rivalſhip in Trade of another Country,
would throw us into more Diſorders, than
the moſt knowing Man in <hi>England</hi> can
readily deſcribe.</p>
               <p>And to ask where will be the Stocks
of Mony to ſet up ſo large a Manufacture?
is but an evaſive way of Arguing; for
where the Proſpect of Gain is certain,
Mony never fails to come. And if it
ſhould ever be determin'd, That <hi>England</hi>
cannot reſtrain that Country in this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portation,
Foreigners will carry Stocks to
an Improving Place, where they may rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably
expect many more Advantages,
than what ſhall ariſe from this Manufa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture.
As for Example, To lay out Mony
upon good Securities, at ten <hi>per Cent.</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt,
to buy Land capable of great Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lioration
at ten Years Purchaſe. And to
have almoſt all the Neceſſaries of Life
half as cheap again as in other parts;
are not all theſe Circumſtances ſufficient
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:93970:81"/>
to invite thither, not only Foreign Stocks,
but very much of our own Mony, and a
great Number of our Work-men, where
their Induſtry will turn to a better Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt
than it does here?</p>
               <p>No Wiſe State, if it has the Means of
preventing the Miſchief, will leave its
Ruin in the Power of another Country.
And if Wars have been thought not only
Prudent, but juſt, which have been made
to interrupt the too ſudden Growth of
any Neighbour-Nation, much more juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiable
may a Mother-Kingdom exerciſe the
Civil Authority in Relation to her own
Children; who from her had their Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and ſtill have their Protection, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
when her own Safety is ſo much
concern'd.</p>
               <p>Nor can this be thought Rigour; 'Tis
but a reaſonable Jealouſie of State, and
only ſevere Wiſdom, which Governments
ſhould ſhow in all their Councils; 'Tis a
preventing Remedy which operates gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in the beginning of the Diſeaſe, before
there are many, and thoſe inveterate Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors
to contend with. And if a timely
Stop be put to theſe Exportations from
<hi>Ireland,</hi> it will hurt but a very few
(which is never to be regarded, where
the good of the whole Publick is in Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion)
and even that Few, without any
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:93970:82"/>
great difficulty, may have their Induſtry
turn'd to ſafer Objects.</p>
               <p>For theſe and ſeveral other Reaſons,
which will occur to ſuch as think ſeriouſly
of this Subject, it ſeems for the Publick
Good, That the Legiſlature of <hi>England</hi>
ſhould, by ſome Reſtrictions, keep <hi>Ireland</hi>
from interfering with us in this Principal
Foundation of our whole Traffick. And
to do it by a Poſitive Law here, and not
to leave it to the Adminiſtration there,
as ſome propoſe, appears to be the rather
requiſite; becauſe when this Step is made,
and when they are render'd incapable of
Exporting Woollen Goods, there will lie
a Neceſſity upon the Governing Part
and Landed Men, of doing their utmoſt
to promote other Improvements, of which
their Soil is capable.</p>
               <p>Nor is it fair to urge, That we may
proceed from one Prohibition to another,
till we leave them nothing, and till they
are quite undone. They can fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally
hurt us no other way, their Rival<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
is dangerous in none but the Woollen
Manufacture, where all <hi>Lucrum Ceſſans,</hi>
is <hi>Damnum Emergens</hi> to <hi>England,</hi> ſince all
our Affairs abroad turn and depend upon
it; nor can we ſuffer any Competitors in
it, if we mean to flouriſh and be Gainers
in the General Ballance of Trade.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="127" facs="tcp:93970:82"/>
To think this Kingdom will either pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhly
or covetouſly hurt that Colony,
is an abſurd Imagination. 'Tis obvious
enough, that too much depends upon the
Poſſeſſion of ſuch an Iſland, to render its
Inhabitants deſperate, and deſirous of a
Change, if they have a large Trade, and
flowing Riches, the Benefit thereof will
redound to us at laſt; And the wiſer a
Government is, the more it will deſire to
ſee 'em proſper, except in this ſingle In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
where their Wealth would be built
upon our Deſtruction.</p>
               <p>But ſuch a Prohibition as we have been
treating of, will have very little Effect,
unleſs they can be likewiſe hindred from
carrying out their Wooll; to prevent
which, their Situation conſider'd, will be
a very hard Matter; but there are no
difficulties of the like Nature, which are
not to be overcome, if the Adminiſtration
be ſtrict and ſteady.</p>
               <p>They, who would prohibit the Expor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of Woollen Goods from <hi>Ireland,</hi> to
Foreign Parts, have hitherto propos'd ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
up there the Linnen Manufacture,
but this Deſign is likewiſe not without
its Dangers: The ſetting up the Linnen
Manufacture will be leſs hurtful than to
ſet up the Woollen, but we are to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
That <hi>Ireland</hi> will be always able to
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:93970:83"/>
ſupply it ſelf with Draperies at Home,
and that there will be no Market for
their Linnen, but <hi>England,</hi> and its De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendences.
Now 'tis evident, That our
Woollen Goods are ſold in ſeveral Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,
namely, <hi>Holland, Hamburgh, Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi>
the <hi>Han's</hi> Towns, and all the Eaſt
Country; many of which Places will
not be able to take off our Woollen Goods,
unleſs we deal for their Linnens: And in
Fact, and by Experience, it has been
ſeen, in the Caſe of the <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Trade,
ſince there has been Imported from thence
vaſt Quantities of Linnens, ſuch as Calli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coes,
Muſlins, Romals for Handkerſhifts,
which anſwer'd the end of Lawns, Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bricks,
and other Linnen Cloath, we have
not Exported that vaſt quantity of Drape<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
to thoſe Northern Parts, of which
Sir <hi>Walter Raleigh</hi> makes mention. As
our Call for their Linnens has diminiſh'd,
their Call for our Draperies has propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionably
decreas'd; and not only ſo, but
theſe People have been compell'd by
Neceſſity to fall upon making Courſe
Woollen Cloath, by which they ſupply
themſelves, and other Places, which
heretofore we were wont to furniſh. So
that it deſerves a very ſerious Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
what future Effect it may have
upon our Woollen Goods, to promote a
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:93970:83"/>
Conſiderable Linnen Manufacture in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Upon the whole Matter, it ought to be
carefully examin'd, Whither or no a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Expedient may not be thought on,
to ſtop their Progreſs in the new Drape<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
than to introduce the Linnen Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facture
there? and whither it would not
be beſt for both Kingdoms to take off the
Prohibition that now lies upon <hi>Iriſh</hi>
Cattle?</p>
               <p>This Point has been formerly much
debated, and it remains yet very doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
when this Prohibition was ſet on
foot, which was moſt conſulted, Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Good, or Private Intereſt; The
Numbers of the Breeding were without
doubt ſtronger, at that time, than thoſe
of the Feeding Lands; but 'tis to be
fear'd, in the making that Act, that the
general Intereſt of <hi>England</hi> was not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
conſider'd.</p>
               <p>If the People of <hi>Ireland</hi> are permitted
to bring their Cattle hither, it will lower
the Price of Fleſh in <hi>England;</hi> a Matter
very important to a Country that Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts
ſo much by Manufactures. 'Tis true,
the Breeding Counties will be thereby
ſomewhat hurt, but it will encourage Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements
and Melioration of Barren
Land, in order to Feed, which will be
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:93970:84"/>
advantagious to the whole Publick of the
Nation. It will divert thoſe of <hi>Ireland,</hi>
from thinking to extend their Trade too
much abroad; a Point not to be ſlighted.
And it will in a manner confine the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
Part of their Dealings to this
Kingdom; which, for many Reaſons of
State, will be beſt and ſafeſt for <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>'Tis therefore ſubmitted to better Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
whither or no to open the way
hither for their Cattle, will not be moſt
adviſable; and the trueſt Method to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
their Progreſs in Manufactures, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
doing any thing that may look like
Injury or Oppreſſion.</p>
               <p>'Tis no true Objection to ſay, That the
People of <hi>Ireland</hi> will not fall readily into
this ſort of Trade, which has been now
ſo long intermitted; for, as we are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd,
the Payments are very ill made,
for that Fleſh, Tallow and Hides, that
are Exported to Foreign Parts. That the
Merchant makes the Butcher ſtay ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
two or three Years, upon pretence
of Bills of Exchange, and Returns ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
from the <hi>Weſt-Indies, Spain,</hi> and
other Parts; and if the Butcher be ill
dealt with, it muſt follow, that the Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lord
cannot be paid his Rent: Whereas
when the Trade was open for <hi>England,</hi>
                  <pb n="131" facs="tcp:93970:84"/>
the Gentlemen of <hi>Ireland</hi> receiv'd ready
Mony, or if they gave Credit, it was
anſwer'd by the next Return; and <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
was to them as <hi>Smithfield</hi> is to <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſhire,
Lincolnſhire,</hi> or any other <hi>Engliſh</hi>
Feeding County; beſides, it would keep
down the Exchange, which would be ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Encouragement to the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Nobility
and Gentry, who ſpend ſo large a Part
of their Eſtates in <hi>London.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that in all likelihood, the People of
that Kingdom, if the ſaid Prohibition
were taken off, would cheerfully ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
to a Law here, binding them not
to Export to Foreign Parts their Wool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len
Goods; nor would they perhaps
think of ſetting up the Linnen Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facture,
which is likewiſe not without
Conſequences very pernicious; and for
theſe Reaſons, the Expedient here pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd,
is now offer'd to Publick Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration.</p>
               <p>Before we quit our preſent Subject <hi>of
Land and its Product,</hi> we ſhall offer ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Hint. The Courſe Draperies is that
part of our Woollen Manufacture, in
which we are in greateſt Danger to be
rival'd by other Countries; it ſtands there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
in need of moſt Encouragement.
There are many Parts of the World,
whoſe Poverty diſables them from buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:93970:85"/>
our Woollen Goods, becauſe of their
high Price. As <hi>Ruſſia, Poland, Tartary,</hi> &amp;c.
and therefore they are ſupply'd by the
<hi>Germans,</hi> or ſome other Neighbours, with
a ſort of Cloath very contemptible, in
Compariſon of what we could make to
anſwer the ſame Ends and Uſes. Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
then, inſtead of paying five <hi>per Cent.</hi>
Cuſtom outward bound, That ſuch Courſe
Cloaths not exceeding ſuch a certain Value,
ſhould for a term of Years receive upon
the Exportation ten <hi>per Cent.</hi> Bounty Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
by way of Encouragement from the
State, for ſo much as the Exporters can
make appear was carry'd out, to Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
with whom we had no Dealings of
that kind before, and that ſuch their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portations
are in order to enlarge our
Trade. A Recompence of this Nature
would in all probability increaſe the
Woollen Manufacture of <hi>England,</hi> in not
many Years, at leaſt one third.</p>
               <p>We have the more largely handled the
<hi>Iriſh</hi> Prohibitions, becauſe in all appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
the Ballance of Trade will very much
depend upon the Meaſures <hi>England</hi> ſhall
take, in relation to that Colony; ſince we
ſhould proceed very heavily in all our Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
Traffick, if <hi>Ireland</hi> is left in a Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
to diſturb us abroad, in the vent of

upon ſuch Prerogatives as are neceſſary
for the Prince's Safety, and to keep the

This able Stateſman lays down,<note place="margin">Teſtament Politique, <hi>Par.</hi> 1. c. 4. §. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>That
good Order in the Revenue depends more on
thoſe who have the Adminiſtration than on
Laws and Regulations, which remain uſeleſs
unleſs ſuch as are employ'd to ſee them obſerv'd
be willing to perform their Duty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Legiſlative Part of the Conſtitution
gives the Mony, but it principally be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs
to the Miniſterial Part to take Care
that what is granted be not waſted, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted,
or miſapply'd; and if ſuch as are
truſted fail to do this, it is incumbent on
the Legiſlature to interpoſe, and call 'em
to a ſtrict Account.</p>
               <p>The Wealth of a Country is Finite, as
well as the Subſtance of any private Man;
and when a Miniſtry ſet themſelves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtriouſly
about it, they can as well ruin
a whole People, as the Duke of <hi>Buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingham</hi>
could ſee an end of his great

               <p>
                  <hi>Harry</hi> III. of <hi>France,</hi> for want of Order
and by being ill-ſerved, in a few Years
conſumed an immenſe Sum, and antici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pated

<hi>Harry</hi> IV. with a very little Care
of his own, but by the infinite Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
Prudence and Honeſty of the Duke

And at this Day, for want of Conduct in

Wealth or Poverty of the Publick does, in

or bad Adminiſtration of its Affairs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Machiavel </hi>does not ſeem to think Libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality
a neceſſary Virtue in a Prince,<note place="margin">Prince, c. 16.</note> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe,
to ſupport it, there muſt go ſo
much Oppreſſion of the People.<hi> And that
a frugal Prince ſhall be accounted Noble to all
from whom he takes nothing away, which are
an infinite number: And that he ſhall be
eſteemed Near and Parſimonious only by thoſe
Few to whom he gives but little. </hi>And he
ſays,<hi> That a Prince ought not ſo much to
concern himſelf (ſo he exacts not upon his
Subjects, ſo he be able to defend himſelf, ſo
he becomes not deſpicable and commits no Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine
upon his People) tho' he be accounted
Covetous, for that it is one of thoſe Vices
which fortifies his Dominion. </hi>And he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves,<hi>That Pope </hi>Julius II.<hi> was liberal till
he came to the Papacy, but frugal afterwards,
which enabled him to do ſuch great Things
against the Power of </hi>France.</p>
               <p>That the Buſineſs of moſt Kingdoms
has been ill managed, proceeds from this:
It imports the lower Rank of Men only
and the People (whoſe Cries ſeldom reach
the Prince till it is too late, and till all is
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:93970:88"/>
paſt Remedy) that Matters ſhould be
frugally ordered, becauſe Taxes muſt ariſe
from their Sweat and Labour. But the
great Ones, who heretofore have had the
Prince's Ear and Favour, or who hoped
to have him in their Poſſeſſion, were
ſway'd by another ſort of Intereſt; they
liked Profuſion, as having had a Proſpect
to be Gainers by it: They can eaſily ſet
their Account even with the State, a ſmall
Charge upon their Land is more than bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanc'd
by a great Place, or a large Penſion.
At the ſame time the People who are to
pay all, and expect to receive nothing,
are glad to ſee a frugal Court; which tho'
it be not ſo good for its Followers, never
fails to inrich a Nation.</p>
               <p>'Tis true, <hi>Galba</hi> is an Inſtance that the
Virtues of a cloſe-handed Prince may be
unſucceſsful in Countries govern'd by the
Sword, and where the Soldier is riotous,
and in long Poſſeſſion of a ſlack Diſcipline.
And perhaps in all Abſolute Monarchies,
he who Governs ſhould rather lean to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
Munificence than Thrift. But
Frugality in the State can never be dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
in a Trading Nation, rul'd by
Laws of its own making; and it is not
only neceſſary in it ſelf, but profitable in
the Example, teaching private Men that
good Husbandry in their Domeſtick Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs,
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:93970:88"/>
which never fails to inrich the whole
Body-Politick.</p>
               <p>Much nobler is it to enjoy the Praiſes
of an Univerſal People, living in Plenty
and at their Eaſe, not burthen'd by Taxes
and Duties; than to have the good Words
of a few Flatterers, or thoſe Harpies
which commonly haunt a Court to gripe
all they can; who, when they are gorg'd
themſelves, pollute all the Remainder
with their foul and obſcene Claws, ſo
that no Body elſe deſires to touch it. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides,
we have hardly an Inſtance of any
Prince, that in time of Need, was
truly aſſiſted and defended by his Minions,
and the Creatures of his Bounty and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour;
but a King belov'd for wiſe, juſt
and careful Government, has been very
ſeldom deſerted by his People.</p>
               <p>But ſuppoſe a Prince ſhould deſire to
exerciſe in a very ample manner the inbred
Magnificence of his Mind; if he will
diſcharge the Truſt committed to him by
the King of Kings; if he will not make
what he counts Virtue diſtructive to his
People, he muſt find Matter to ſupply his
liberal Inclinations; which he only can
do, who ſees that his Miniſters look well
after his Income and Expences.</p>
               <p>Some Perſons have a ſtrange Notion,
That large Payments to the State are not
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:93970:89"/>
hurtful to the Publick; That Taxes make
Mony circulate; That it imports not
what A pays, when B is to receive it:
But we hope to ſhow, that they who
argue in this manner, are very much mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken.</p>
               <p>We have formerly touch'd upon this
Matter in the <hi>Diſcourſes on the Revenues,</hi>

this Point ſomething more at large.</p>
               <p>All Nations have a certain Annual In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
upon which the People live and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt,
out of which Taxes of all kinds ariſe;

               </p>
               <p>And we muſt beg leave to repeat, in this
place, ſomething which we have laid down
in thoſe Tracts;<note place="margin">P. 195.</note> 
                  <q>That to nouriſh the
Maſs of Mankind, as to their Annual
Expence in the Way and Form of Liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
practis'd in each of the three Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,
ſuch an Innual Income is neceſſary
as is ſet down in the foregoing Scheme.
By Annual Income we mean the whole
that ariſes in any Country, from Land
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:93970:89"/>
and its Product, from Foreign Trade
and Domeſtick Buſineſs, as Arts, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufactures,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> And by Annual Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence,
we underſtand what is of Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity
conſum'd to Cloath and Feed the
People, or what is requiſite for their
Defence in time of War, or for their
Ornament in time of Peace. And
where the Annual Income exceeds the
Expence, there is a Superlucration ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing,
which may be call'd Wealth or
National Stock. The Revenue of the
Government is a part of this Annual In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come,
as likewiſe a part of its Expence;
and where it bears too large a propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
with the whole, as in <hi>France,</hi> the
common People muſt be miſerable, and
burthen'd with heavy Taxes. That
part of the Prince's Revenue that nour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhes
his own Perſon is very little; but
in great Monarchies, where numerous
Armies, large Fleets, and pompous
Courts are maintain'd, there the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
ſwells high, inſomuch that to the
Maintenance of the Governing part,
<hi>viz.</hi> the Prince, his Officers of State,
Military Power, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which are not in
time of Peace above one 26th of the
whole, there is required near the Ninth
Penny of the Annual Income. And in
ſuch Countries the Governing part are
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:93970:90"/>
Rich or at their Eaſe, but the other 25
parts, who are the Body of the People,
muſt be oppreſſed with Taxes, as may
be obſerv'd in the French Dominions.
And this holds more ſtrongly, where
the Publick Debts make the Payment
of a ſixth part of the Annual Income
neceſſary, which, for ſome time, is like
to be the Caſe of <hi>France.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>To explain theſe Aſſertions ſhall be the
Subject of this Section, whereby it will
appear how much the Ballance of Trade
may be affected by our Payments to the
Publick.</p>
               <p>We ſhall endeavour to ſhow, in the
laſt Section, That the Wealth of a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
does in a great meaſure proceed from
a right Adminiſtration of its Affairs:
However, it may happen ſometimes to
increaſe in Riches where Things are in the
main ill adminiſter'd, as <hi>England</hi> did to the
Year 1688, in the two Reigns that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
this; but whoever looks carefully
into the true Reaſon why we grew ſo faſt
in Wealth during thoſe Eight and twenty
Years, will find it was becauſe we paid
all that time but ſmall Taxes and Duties
to the Government, comparatively with
other Nations.</p>

               <p>During all the War, there has been le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vied
here great Sums every Year, and
many of the foremention'd Fonds are to
continue ſo long, that it will be ſeveral
Years before our Annual Payments can be
conſiderably diminiſh'd. And there is
ſuch a difference between a Twentieth
and an Eighth, or indeed a Tenth, or
a Twelfth Part (which yet we ſhall not
come at in ſome time) as muſt inevitably
affect the Nation's Trade, and the whole
Body of its People.</p>
               <p>When there was rais'd no more than
about a Twentieth Part, there were great
Sums of Mony to circulate in Foreign
Traffick, and to employ in enlarging our
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:93970:91"/>
Home-Manufactures, which two Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
of our Wealth muſt be dry, when

               <p>There is ſcarce any of theſe new Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues,
which do not give Trade ſome
deſperate Wound. The Additional Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
on Beer and Ale, and the Tax upon
Malt, are apparently a Burthen upon the
Woollen Manufactures, affecting the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
Spinner, Weaver and the Dyer, who
all of them muſt be rais'd in their Wages,
when the Neceſſaries of Life are rais'd to
them. The Conſequence of which will
be, That our Woollen Goods muſt come
at a heavy and diſadvantagious Price into
the Foreign Markets.</p>
               <p>There is no Man will pretend, that
High Cuſtoms are not pernicious to our
Commerce abroad. A Nation is not
Gainers in the general Ballance of Trade,
by the Dealing of a Few, who are able
to employ in it great Stocks; ſuch may
make to themſelves an Immenſe Gain,
but they go but a little towards inrich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the <hi>whole</hi> Publick, which ſeldom
thrives, but when, in a manner, the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal
People bend their Thoughts to this
ſort of Buſineſs; when every one is ready
with his ſmall Stock, and little Sum, to
venture and rove about the World: Of
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:93970:92"/>
theſe ſome proſper, and others are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done;
however, in the way of Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize,
Men who do not thrive themſelves,
may yet contribute very much to make
their Country Rich, which gets by the
Dealings of all, and does not ſuffer by
the unfortunate Conduct of here and there
a Merchant. But when the Cuſtoms are
High, all theſe under Dealers, who all
along in <hi>England</hi> have made up the chief
Bulk of our Trading Men, muſt hold
their Hands, tho' in Skill, Induſtry, and
inventive Parts and Wit, they may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
Merchants of more Wealth, and of
a higher Rank. Nor is it indeed practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable
for Men of but a moderate Fortune
to Deal at all, when more than treble
that Sum is neceſſary to have ready now
to pay the King, which formerly would
ſet up a Subſtantial Trader, and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
him in ſufficient Buſineſs.</p>
               <p>But of all the new Impoſitions, none
are ſo dangerous to the very Being of
Trade, nor ſo hurtful to all its Parts and

Out Ports to every diſtinct Country; and
alſo of all the Importations to <hi>London,</hi>
and the Out Ports from every diſtinct
Country, and what might at that time
be the value of thoſe Goods, being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:93970:96"/>
by able Merchants: And this to be
done for ſome competent Number of
Years by reaſonable Mediums, it may be
very nearly gueſs'd from ſuch a View,
how the Ballance of Trade ſtood from
time to time.</p>
               <p>But where a thing ſo much within
their Reach (and which the <hi>French</hi> Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
are ſaid to do in their Exports and
Imports) has not been done by the Men
of Buſineſs here; there is no way of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
how the Ballance ſtands, but by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering
the Numbers of the People, and
their probable Conſumption of our Home
Product, and of Foreign Materials, from
whence a Judgment may be form'd, not
indeed perfectly demonſtrable, but very
near the Truth.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>King</hi> obſerves, That by how much
the Nation does not conſume of its Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports,
but either lays up, or increaſes the
Stock of Gold or Silver, or other Ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quate
Treaſure, or of durable Commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
in Specie; by ſo much, at leaſt, does
the Nation gain by Foreign Trade, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
all other Advantages of Naviga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>'Tis difficult to know how our Navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
has proceeded for theſe ten Years
laſt paſt, but 'tis to be feared, That the
Gain which Foreigners have made, by
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:93970:97"/>
fetching and carrying in their own Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms,
has been much greater of late, then
it was heretofore; which muſt be a very
conſiderable Prejudice to <hi>England,</hi> and
highly tend to ſet the Ballance of Trade
againſt us.</p>
               <p>Reckoning long and ſhort Voyages to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
the principal Expence of fitting
out a Trading Veſſel, is Drink and Meat.
The Exciſes and Duty upon Malt, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
doubt, make Drink ſufficiently dear
to the Freighter. And the Duty upon Salt
makes Victualling a very heavy Burthen
upon him, all which muſt end in leſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
our Navigation from time to time;
for undoubtedly Foreigners obſerving
how dear Freight is with us, will Trade
in their own Ships as much as poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
               <p>In Barrelling up Beef and Pork, we
heretofore made uſe of St. <hi>Martin</hi>'s, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
or <hi>Oleron</hi> and <hi>Engliſh</hi> Salt mixed together;
and with theſe Materials the Fleſh was
beſt prepared, both for wholſomneſs, and
long keeping; our own Salt without Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
Mixture being fiery, corroſive, and
very Scorbutick. As we are informed,
the St. <hi>Martins,</hi> and worſer ſort of <hi>French</hi>
Salt, from 1676, to 1688, was delivered
in <hi>London,</hi> at about 2 <hi>l.</hi> 5 <hi>s. per</hi> Tun, and
forty Buſhels to the Tun. And that from
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:93970:97"/>
                  <hi>Oleron,</hi> at from 2 <hi>l.</hi> 10 <hi>s.</hi> to 2 <hi>l.</hi> 15. <hi>per</hi>
Tun. But now the very Duty for forty
Buſhels of <hi>Oleron</hi> Salt amounts to 13 <hi>l.</hi>
6. <hi>s.</hi> 8. <hi>d.</hi> beſides the 25 <hi>per Cent. ad valo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem,</hi>
of which formerly the prime Coſt
came to but 2 <hi>l.</hi> 15 <hi>s.</hi> at higheſt: The
Duty likewiſe upon forty Buſhels of <hi>Lisbon</hi>
Salt comes to 13 <hi>l.</hi> 6 <hi>s.</hi> 8 <hi>d.</hi> of which the
prime Coſt was formerly, at higheſt, but
3 <hi>l.</hi> 10 <hi>s.</hi> And as to our <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> and
<hi>Limington</hi> Salt, which is now generally
made uſe of in Salting Beef and Pork for
Trading Veſſels; the very Duty for forty
Buſhels amounts to 6 <hi>l.</hi> 13 <hi>s.</hi> 4 <hi>d.</hi> of which,
before the War, the prime Coſt came but
to 3 <hi>l.</hi> at the deareſt Market: Inſomuch
that we are credibly inform'd, a Merchant
can ſtore himſelf in <hi>Ireland,</hi> for a long
Voyage, with Salt, Beef and Pork, ready
pack'd up, almoſt as cheap as he can buy
the Salt in <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that for long Voyages, the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant
will either Victual in <hi>Ireland,</hi> or Salt
his Beef and Pork on ſome Foreign Coaſt,
as he Sails along, where Proviſions ſhall
be cheap, which muſt bring a great
Damage to the Landed Intereſt here; or
if he does not do ſo, Victualling will be ſo
expenſive to him, as to make Freight much
dearer than it ought to be in a Country
that expects to thrive by Trade.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="154" facs="tcp:93970:98"/>
The Conſequence of all which will be,
That the Body of our Merchants muſt
lie under a general Diſcouragement;
They will neglect looking after National
Gain, which <hi>Engliſh</hi> Merchants have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
heretofore as much conſider'd in
their Dealings, as any Trading Men in
the whole Commercial World; They
will have an Eye to nothing but their
own temporary Profit, and fuffer Strang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
to go away with thoſe Gains which
<hi>England</hi> was wont to make by Freight;
from whence it will follow, That we
muſt decay in our Stock of Shipping, and
decreaſe every Year in the breed of Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men;
and when this happens, we muſt
no more pretend to ſuch a Naval Strength
as has hitherto made us terrible to all our
Neighbours.</p>
               <p>Trade, without doubt, is in its nature
a pernicious thing; it brings in that
Wealth which introduces Luxury; it
gives a riſe to Fraud and Avarice, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhes
Virtue and Simplicity of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners;
it depraves a People, and makes
way for that Corruption which never fails
to end in Slavery, Foreign or Domeſtick.
<hi>Licurgus,</hi> in the moſt perfect Model of
Government that was ever fram'd, did
baniſh it from his Common-wealth. But,
the Poſture and Condition of other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:93970:98"/>
conſider'd, 'tis become with us a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
Evil. We ſhall be continually ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
to Inſults and Invaſions without ſuch
a Naval Force, as is not to be had natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
but where there is an extended Traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick.
However, if Trade cannot be made
ſubſervient to the Nation's Safety, it ought
to be no more encourag'd here than it was
in <hi>Sparta:</hi> And it can never tend to make
us ſafe, unleſs it be ſo managed as to make
us increaſe in Shipping and in the Breed
of Seamen.</p>
               <p>Freight is not only the moſt Politick,
but the moſt National and moſt certain
Profit a Country can poſſibly make by
Trade; Therefore all Duties muſt be
pernicious that burthen it, and make it
dear. And we have dwelt the longer
upon this Article of the Salt Duty, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it ſeems to have more dangerous
Conſequences, in relation to our Commerce
abroad, than all the other Impoſitions put
together.</p>
               <p>The late Tax upon Coals is a heavy
Burthen on all Handicrafts working on
Iron, a Manufacture in which we are
now come to a great Perfection. And the
Skill and Neatneſs of our Work-men is ſuch
in Locks, Keys, Hindges, and other Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſities
of this kind; that our Exportati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of theſe Commodities may in time
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:93970:99"/>
grow very conſiderable, if this new Duty
does not interrupt their Induſtry.</p>
               <p>We have ſhown in ſeveral Inſtances,
how the Exciſes lately ſet a foot, may
affect us in the general Ballance of Trade.
And we have done it with a deſign of
making it appear how much it is for the
Common Good, to endeavour to get out
of thoſe Debts, for which theſe Revenues
are the Security and Fund.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>King,</hi> in a Scheme of his, of the
Yearly Increaſe and Decreaſe of the Actual
Stock of <hi>England,</hi> from the Year 1600. to
1698. and what it may probably amount
to by the Year 1710. if the preſent Peace
continue, (and none of thoſe Accidents of
Plague, War, Fires and Civil Diſcords in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervene,
which more or leſs do certainly
diminiſh or hinder the Increaſe of the
Nations Wealth, whenever they happen)
computes, That <hi>Anno</hi> 1600. the ſaid
Actual Stock was but about 25 Millions,
making a Yearly Increaſe of about 4 or
500,000 <hi>l.</hi> That <hi>Anno</hi> 1630. it was about
37 Millions, making a Yearly Increaſe
of about one Million. That in 1664.
(the Year before the laſt great Plague)
it was about 64 Millions, making a
Yearly Increaſe of about 1,200,000 <hi>l.</hi> And
that <hi>Anno</hi> 1668. it was about 86 Millions,
making a Yearly Increaſe of 2,400,000 <hi>l.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="157" facs="tcp:93970:99"/>
And Concludes,</p>
               <p>Firſt, That the laſt Plague, the Fire
of <hi>London,</hi> and the <hi>Dutch</hi> War, did actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
diminiſh the ſaid Stock, at leaſt 9 or
10 Millions, and hindred the Increaſe of
18 or 20 Millions more.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That the laſt War with
<hi>France,</hi> with the other Circumſtances of
the Revolution, and the Recoyning the
Mony, has actually diminiſh'd the ſaid
Stock about 12 Millions, and hindred the
Increaſe of about 28 Millions beſides.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, That the Nation will not
arrive to the ſame Degree of Actual
Stock, which it had <hi>Anno</hi> 1688. till about
the Year 1705. nor make an Increaſe of
2,400,000 <hi>l. per Annum,</hi> as it did in 1688.
till about the Year 1706. nor then neither,
unleſs the Taxes be conſiderably dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd;
that thereby our Navigation and
Commerce may be fully reſtored, to what
it was before the late War.</p>
               <p>We do not pretend to give any Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt
of the preſent Poſture of our Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
Trade, nor how it ſtood during all
the laſt War, for it would be launching
into a very wide Sea; but without doubt,
the Immenſe Sums that have been rais'd
every Year, and the variety of new Duties
that have been lately levied, are a heavy
Burthen upon it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="158" facs="tcp:93970:100"/>
And in order to give ſome little Light
into this Matter, and to ſhow how the
Ballance has been, and may be thereby
affected, we ſhall briefly State what Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
has been Anually granted ſince the
War.</p>

               <p>So that except in the Article of Intereſt
Mony, and except in the Article of
1,465,623 <hi>l.</hi> 19 <hi>s.</hi> 09½ <hi>d.</hi> in which the
Demands of the Miniſters for the State of
the War, exceeded what was granted by the
Parliament, the Expences of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
ſeem to have been fully ſupply'd,
and that there remains an over-Ballance of
2,902,245 <hi>l.</hi> to be accounted for.</p>
               <p>Now as to Intereſt-Mony for the
5,000,000 <hi>l.</hi> with which the Crown-Revenue
may have been charg'd towards
the War, thoſe Fonds, moſt of 'em, have
and will anſwer the Principal and all the
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:93970:103"/>
Intereſt allow'd by Parliament: And
other Intereſt, which ſeveral Fonds fell
ſhort of ſatisfying, has been in a great
meaſure made good by the Supply of
7,000,000 <hi>l.</hi> granted to anſwer Defici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encies.</p>
               <p>And as to the State of the War having
exceeded what was granted, in ballancing
the general Accompt, this Article ought to
be conſidered, if during the whole War
the Muſter-Rolls have been full; and if
all along we have had our Complement of
Ships and Seamen, according to that State
of the War which was every Year laid
before the Parliament.</p>
               <p>But upon the whole Matter, conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
what has been granted, and what may
probably have been expended, there ſeems
good Reaſon to think that the Publick of
<hi>England,</hi> if all Accompts were narrowly
inſpected, cannot be much in Arrear
either to the Fleet, Army, or to the Civil
Liſt.</p>
               <p>So that if there ſhall remain any great
Arrear, in all likelihood it muſt chiefly
ariſe from exorbitant Premiums, unwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable
Intereſt, and other ways of lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out Mony, hurtful to the King, and
diſtructive to the People.</p>
               <p>The rough Draught of our general
Accompts here given, which is as perfect
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:93970:104"/>
as a By-ſtander only could procure, may
perhaps afford ſome little Help to ſuch as
will think of theſe Affairs; and this rude
Model may contribute towards the form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of a better Scheme.</p>
               <p>The Forty eight Millions granted, as
we have ſaid, by Parliament for the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Years from 1689 to 1698 incluſive,
have not been actually levied. To ſtate
exactly how much of it has been already
rais'd, and what proportion of it remains
ſecured by remote Fonds, is not to be done
without greater Helps than the Writer of
theſe Papers can come at: But ſo far we
know, and may affirm ſafely, that a great
part of the Product of Land, our Trade,
and Manufactures, remain ſtill mortgaged
for upwards of twenty Millions.</p>
               <p>Two of the Nine Pences on Beer and
Ale are to be eſteemed as a Perpetuity, the
third Nine Pence is engaged for a long
Term of Time; the firſt Duty upon Salt
can be look'd upon no better than as a
perpetual Fond; the new Cuſtoms, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
Acts and Joint-Stocks, the Duty on
Marriages, Births, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the firſt Duty on
Stamp'd paper, the Duty on Windows,
half the Duty on Glaſs-Ware, the new
Duties on Whale-Fins and Scotch Linnen,
are continued to the Firſt of <hi>August,</hi> 1706.
The laſt Duties upon Salt, and Stamp'd
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:93970:104"/>
Paper, are Perpetuities; there is a further
Subſidy of Tonnage and Poundage grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from the laſt of <hi>January,</hi> 1699. for
His Majeſty's Life-time; and the Impoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
upon Malt, Leather and Paper, are
not expired.</p>
               <p>To imagine we can buy off and redeem,
in any moderate time, all theſe Perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuities
or long Fonds, is a vain Hope;
but this may be laid down for a certain
Truth, That <hi>England</hi> will never flouriſh
in Trade and Manufactures till the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
Part of 'em are clear'd, and till our
Affairs are brought to ſuch a Poſture, that
we may not pay to the Government
either for the Support of the Crown, or
on Accompt of Fonds, where the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
is ſunk, above 2,300,000 <hi>l. per Annum,</hi>
or about a twentieth part of the Nation's
general Income, which was our Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
before the War.</p>
               <p>And unleſs this can be compaſs'd it will
be found, That in no long Courſe of Time
we ſhall languiſh and decay every Year,
by Steps eaſy enough to be perceived by
ſuch as conſider of theſe Matters. Our
Gold and Silver will be carried off by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees,
Rents will fall, the Purchaſe of
Land will decreaſe, Wooll will ſink in its
Price, our Stock of Shipping will be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſhed,
Farm-houſes will go to ruin,
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:93970:105"/>
Induſtry will decay, and we ſhall have
upon us all the viſible Marks of a declining
People.</p>
               <p>It may indeed be objected, That <hi>France</hi>
for about forty, and <hi>Holland</hi> for above a
hundred Years have thriven by Trade,
notwithſtanding that all the while they
have lain under the Burthen of heavy
Taxes. To which may be anſwered,
That where (as in <hi>France</hi>) the Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration
in other Things is exact and right,
the Subjects, though poor, may enlarge
their Traffick, for general good Order
makes amends for a great deal of Oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion;
but they would yet have had more
Trade if their Prince had left 'em richer:
Beſides, Arbitrary Power has compell'd
'em to that Domeſtick Thrift, which of it
ſelf goes very far to make a People ſucceed
in Foreign Commerce, tho' their Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
to the Publick are exceſſive. And
as to the Dutch they have been ſo long
inur'd to this Parſimony, that the more
they are to pay the State, the more they
ſave at home; and they always take care
not to clog their Importations; and from
this Polity it comes that high Taxes are
not hurtful to their Trade.</p>
               <p>But in Countries where the Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration
of Affairs is looſe, partly through
the mildneſs of the Laws, and partly
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:93970:105"/>
through the bad Execution of 'em, where
the People have been in a long Poſſeſſion
of Eaſe and Plenty, and where they think
it an Eſſential part of Freedom to be as
Expenſive and Luxurious as they pleaſe,
and where no Man retrenches upon any
publick Accompt whatſoever: Among
ſuch a People, high Taxes, Duties, and
Impoſitions, muſt inevitably occaſion a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay
of Trade; and tho' their Dealings
ſeem large and not to be interrupted,
they ſhall carry on ſuch a ſort of Traffick
as will bring along with it at laſt their
certain Ruin.</p>
               <p>A variety of new Impoſitions and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
Fonds do not only hurt us in the
Ballance of Trade, as we have ſhown,
but they are dangerous to Liberty, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
which, Trade can never truly flouriſh,
and without which it is indeed of no Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance;
for to what end ſhould Men
acquire Wealth, which they cannot call
their own? And accordingly under Deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potick
Governments (except in ſome
places where the Adminiſtration of the
Tyranny is very wiſely carried on) but
few trouble themſelves with the Thoughts
of Foreign Traffick.</p>
               <p>Whoever conſiders the vaſt number of
new Duties now a-foot, will find that 'tis
not impoſſible to make 'em the Engines
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:93970:106"/>
wherewith bad Men, ſome time or other,
may endeavour to undermine our Civil
Rights. 'Tis true, in this Reign we have
no reaſon to entertain ſuch a Fear, but a
Country that will preſerve its Conſtitution
muſt provide againſt remote Dangers.</p>
               <p>At preſent we pay to the Government,
beſides the Three Shillings Aid and Poll-Mony,
ſo many Duties, Old and New,
as amount to about Three Millions and a
half <hi>per Annum.</hi> Some of 'em, 'tis true,
expire ſhortly. But ſuppoſe Neceſſity or
bad Management (and there is nothing
which ill Husbandry cannot devour)
ſhould compel us to continue what is now
expiring for a longer time; and admit that
for preſent Subſiſtance, and to pay old
Debts, theſe Fonds of Three Millions and
a half <hi>per Annum</hi> ſhould be ſettled as a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity
to Lenders, for ſome certain time
to come.</p>
               <p>Suppoſe then a Government in the Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion
of ſuch a large Revenue at firſt le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gally
granted, put into a Method of Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection,
and to the Payment of which the
People ſhall be accuſtomed.</p>
               <p>And ſuppoſe, in ſome future Reign, the
Miniſters ſhould be either weary or afraid
of Parliaments, and deſirous to Govern by
the Sword, and without Law. That
this may happen is not impoſſible, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:93970:106"/>
we have heretofore ſeen Stateſmen
ſo diſpos'd.</p>
               <p>'Tis to be hoped this is a Danger very
remote indeed; but when a Miniſtry ſhall
be ſo madly inclin'd, the Symptoms of
their approaching Frenzy will be evident
enough; for at ſuch a Seaſon we ſhall
ſee 'em chooſe rather to be ſupply'd by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
Fonds, than with what will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
ready Mony: And they will take care
that Revenues granted may not be well
managed nor improved to the Height,
with this Deſign, That the People may
be kept in the dark, both as to what they
give, and as to what each Branch is like to
yield.</p>
               <p>Suppoſe then an Ambitious and Deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate
Set of Men, with all theſe Thoughts
about 'em, and reſolved to make their
Maſter Abſolute, may they not, with the
Help of ſuch an ample Revenue, quite
overthrow our Conſtitution? Arbitrary
Miniſters have heretofore ſtopp'd the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chequer;
and if we ſhould ever ſee Men
of the ſame Stamp upon the Stage of Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs,
'tis not impoſſible but that they
may run into the ſame wicked Meaſures,
eſpecially if they ſhould be back'd with
the Support of a Standing Army.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="172" facs="tcp:93970:107"/>
The Liberties of a People are but in a
very precarious Condition, when they
can be ſubverted by one pernicious Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel:
It ſhould therefore be the Care of
ſuch as love their Country, to render this
fatal Advice as dangerous and impractica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
as Laws can make it.</p>
               <p>At a time when there is ſuch an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe
Revenue collected every Year, it
ſeems a Fault in our Conſtitution that
ſufficient Proviſion is not made againſt
diverting and miſapplying the Publick
Treaſure, and againſt breaking into Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriated
Fonds. And to ſpeak in plain
Words, There is reaſon to fear that the
Laws have not made it Criminal enough
to ſtop Payments in the Exchequer.</p>
               <p>When a Town that apprehends a
Siege finds it ſelf weak by Nature in one
place, the firſt Care of the Defenders is
to fortifie that Poſt as well as ever they
can. In the ſame manner a Conſtitution
that is attackable one way, ſhould
ſtrengthen that Part with ſevere Laws.
The Exchequer therefore ſhould be fenced
about with all poſſible Skill, that it may
never be invaded by bold and deſigning
Miniſters.</p>
               <p>A Stop there would at once pull down
all our Civil Rights. Nay, to ſtop the
Principal only, tho' the Payments of the
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:93970:107"/>
Intereſt ſhould be continued, would be
fatal to our Conſtitution, for there would
yet remain an Income large enough to
make Parliaments uſeleſs. And if wicked
Men ſhould thus ſet up for themſelves,
they would ſtill have Revenue ſufficient
to bear their Expences, and to keep up an
Army to awe ſuch as their Conduct ſhall
diſpleaſe.</p>
               <p>Some indeed will argue, That a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
Miniſtry will as ſoon make new
Levies of Mony, as venture thus to divert
what has been already granted and appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priated:
But this Objection has no weight
in it. The People more willingly ſubmit
to a Tax once lawful, than to pay a new
Duty againſt Law. The Tonnage and
Poundage illegally levied in the former
part of King <hi>Charles</hi> I.'s Reign, did not
occaſion half the Clamour as the new Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
of Ship-Mony. In the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of King <hi>James</hi> II. d's Reign, the
Tonnage and Poundage, and Temporary
Exciſe, determined by King <hi>Charles</hi> his
Death, was paid without oppoſition;
but if King <hi>James</hi> had attempted to raiſe
a new Tax by the Regal Authority, his
Subjects without doubt would not have
paid it. Beſides, when a Tax is lawful
in its Original, 'tis to be feared that the
People will not much concern themſelves
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:93970:108"/>
who is to receive it, the Court, or ſuch as
have truſted the Exchequer; but they
would be alarm'd to ſome purpoſe if they
ſhould be called upon to make new Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
not warranted by Law. So that
in all probability more Danger may ariſe
to our Liberties from breaking into old
Fonds appropriated, and ſtopping the
Exchequer, than from making new and
forcible Levies upon the Subject.</p>
               <p>And though there is no Cauſe in this
Reign to fear ſuch Attempts, yet it muſt
certainly be Wiſdom to provide againſt
future Evils, eſpecially when 'tis poſſible
that one deſperate and wicked Council
may deſtroy that Conſtitution for which
we have been ſo long contending.</p>
               <p>The true way to hinder ſuch a Diſeaſe
from ever coming upon the Body-Politick
will be to remove the Cauſe, by leſſening
aſſoon as poſſible theſe Payments to the
Publick of three Millions and a half <hi>per
Annum,</hi> beſides Polls and Land-Taxes;
which large Iſſues may endanger Liberty,
and without doubt hurt us in the Ballance
of Trade.</p>
               <p>The Debts for which theſe Fonds are a
Security, by Negligence will every Year
increaſe, inſomuch that in a very ſhort
time, and with a very little more Care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſsneſs,
the Raiſing more and more will
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:93970:108"/>
grow unavoidable for our common De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
till at laſt we ſhall come to pay con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly
between five and ſix Millions <hi>per
Annum.</hi> And when this Kingdom ſhall
be arrived at that Period of ill Conduct,
we may venture to Pronounce, That the
Common People of <hi>England</hi> will in all
Circumſtances be then as poor and miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,
as the Common People of <hi>France</hi> were
before the War. And we deſire all good
Patriots to carry this Reflection in their
minds.</p>
               <p>On the contrary by good Management
this Debt may be leſſen'd, ſo that the
Fonds which are its Security (inſtead of
of being continued) may be dropt every
Year, till at laſt we may come to pay to
the Government for its Support and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
ſuch a Sum as will not be danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
to our Freedoms, nor prejudicial to our
Foreign Traffick.</p>
               <p>He who propoſes Thrift may pleaſe the
Common People, but he ſhall be ſure to
diſguſt ſome others; However the Writer
of theſe Papers thinks it his Duty to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend
Frugality in the State; and he
believes 'tis the Wiſeſt and Honeſteſt way
of Inriching the Publick, to make it Rich
out of its own Revenues.</p>

To come at ſuch a future Thrift as may
bring us out of that Debt which lies ſo hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy
in the other Scale when we conſider of
the Ballance of Trade; One way perhaps
will be ſeverely to Enquire how the Forty
eight Millions already given have been Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended:
Beſides it will not peradventure
be difficult to ſhow that of the many Milli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
ſtill owing, a large Sum might be ſaved,
if the Publick Accompts from their very be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
were overhaled.</p>
               <p>A Government that will get out of Debt,
muſt look nicely into every particular; It
ought in Prudence to examine into all Grants
made by the Crown, when the People lay
under the Burthen of Heavy Taxes.</p>
               <p>'Tis ſaid that the Forfeitures in <hi>Ireland,</hi>
and the Lands poſſeſſed by the Crown in
1688, would ſatisfie a large part of what
the Publick is now Indebted.</p>
               <p>'Tis alledged that Gains unwarrantable
in Law, and not to be juſtified by any
Neceſſity whatſoever, have been made in
ſeveral Contracts with the Crown, if all
this were look'd into, very probably ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
might be ſav'd towards diſcharging
the Nations Debts.</p>

can ſafely, and without Trouble, reap
ſuch Gains, breed their Children to be
Merchants? Will they venture great
Stocks to make Diſcoveries, and employ
their Induſtry to enlarge and extend our

think of building that multitude of Trad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Veſſels which alone can rear us up a

that Tide of Wealth which was wont

Channel; and if we mind no other Traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick
but that which juſt ſupplies our
Luxuries, muſt we not in a few Years be
Loſers in the general Ballance?</p>
               <p>Where Intereſt is high, the Merchants
care not to deal in any but rich Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities,
whoſe Freight is eaſy, and whoſe
Vent is certain in corrupted Countries;
And of theſe Coſtly Wares very many
carry out Mony, and but few bring any
back to the Kingdom. 'Tis the Bulky
Goods, whoſe Returns are not of ſo great
Profit, that breed moſt Seamen, and that
are moſt Nationally gainful; but ſuch
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:93970:114"/>
Goods cannot be very much dealt in where
Intereſt is high, nor can any Laws in the
World lower it where great Sums are
continually borrow'd by the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
And by theſe Inſtances it muſt

to the Publick may affect the Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance
of Trade.</p>
               <p>And, treating upon this Subiect, we
cannot but take Notice, where the Prince
is frequently abſent from his own Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,
ſojourning for a long ſpace of time
in a Foreign Country, in which He, His
Court, and His whole Retinue are oblig'd
to make great Expences, That this is
highly prejudicial to the Ballance of Trade,
and, without doubt, muſt incline the
Scale to that Nation's Side where the
Mony is ſpent.</p>
               <p>Upon the whole Matter, If the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues
already granted are well look'd
after, and improv'd; if the Accompts
of the Fleet and Army are carefully in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected;
if the Grants are ſtrictly exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd;
if the State enters intirely upon
Frugal Meaſures; and if we reſolve to
exert our Selves, ſo as not to let this dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
Burthen lie long upon us, this
Great Debt may be clear'd in ſome mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
time, and thoſe large Payments to
the Publick will ceaſe, which are like ſo
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:93970:115"/>
many bloody Iſſues that emaciate the
Body-Politick, and render it Hectical and
Conſumptive; and, if this Debt were
paid, we ſhould get rid of that variety of
new Exciſes, and high Cuſtoms, which
hurt Foreign Traffick, and interrupt us
in our Domeſtick Buſineſs, and which are
more eſpecially a heavy Weight upon the
Woollen Manufacture.</p>
               <p>Even in a Common-wealth 'tis dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
for one part of the People to be
very much indebted to the other; and in
<hi>Rome</hi> it was the occaſion of great Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
When the State has borrow'd
large Sums, and iſſued out Securities by
Tallies upon different Fonds, 'tis common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſaid the Publick is ſo and ſo indebted;
but in truth the Caſe is otherwiſe, and
more properly ſpeaking, theſe ſort of
Fonds divide a Country into two Ranks
of Men, of which one are Creditors and
the other Debtors; and this Diſtinction
does without doubt belong to all Nations
where the People pay Taxes to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
as it now happens to be our Caſe in
<hi>England.</hi> The <hi>Creditors</hi> are the Bank,
ſuch as deal with the Publick for Stores,
Lenders of all kinds, beſides a great many
Foreigners, whoſe Mony is lent to the
State in Engliſh Names. The <hi>Debtors</hi>
are the Landed Men, the 5th or 6th part
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:93970:115"/>
of whoſe Rents are pawn'd for the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Service from Year to Year, by Aids
and Land-Fonds. All Merchants like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
who pay Cuſtoms, and all Shop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keepers
and Retailers are, according to our
Diſtinction, to be accompted <hi>Debtors.</hi>
Thus almoſt all <hi>England</hi> may not be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>properly
divided into <hi>Debtors</hi> and <hi>Credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,</hi>
nor in a long and expenſive War was
this wholly to be avoided, but without
doubt it cannot be wiſe nor ſafe to let this
Diſtinction long continue; for tho' ſuch
as Receive may like their Condition and
think themſelves at Eaſe, yet ſuch as are
to Pay cannot be ſo well contented. 'Tis
true, ſome modern Politicians have run
upon another Notion; and ſeveral Perſons
have thought that the more Fonds are
erected, the more People are engaged to
preſerve the preſent Government. This
Policy indeed of theirs would hold good
if they could make out, That the Lenders
are ſtronger; and more in number than
ſuch as are concern'd in Payments to the
Publick: But it rather ſeems to hold in
Senſe and Reaſon, That the Throne of
that Prince, in a Free Nation, muſt be
the moſt firmly eſtabliſhed, whoſe Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs
permit him to ask the feweſt Taxes
from his People.</p>

               <p>In the Second and Third Sections we

and Employing the People, and
to Improve Land and its Product. In this

this Ballance may be affected by our Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
to the Publick. And in the laſt

That the Wealth and Proſperity of a

which was all they deſir'd; but the Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs
theſe Monſtrous Princes brought

Heads; who yet could not reſcue

People lull'd aſleep, with the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
they entertain'd, that the Laws ſtill
govern'd, becauſe they ſaw every year

corrupted, made the Tyranny bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
and ſafe: For the People could never
be induc'd to oppoſe that Power which
ſtill bore ſome Reſemblance to their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
Form of Government.</p>
               <p>In the ſame manner, if in future Ages
our Parliaments ſhould be debauch'd in
Principles, and become willing to be the
Inſtruments of a Prince's Will, and to act
as he directs them, Arbitrary Power
would be here ſettled upon a laſting Foot;
for the Common People would never
join with any who would attempt to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem
their Country, becauſe they will be
deceiv'd by Names and Forms, and think

<pb n="196" facs="tcp:93970:118"/>

Repreſentatives of a People, 'tis like a
Cronical Diſeaſe hardly to be rooted out.
When Servile Compliance and Flattery
come to predominate, things proceed
from bad to worſe, till at laſt the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
is quite diſſolv'd. Abſolute
Monarchies are in danger of great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſions,
when one Man, their Prince,
happens to be weak, or wicked; but
Commonwealths, or mix'd Conſtitutions
are ſafe till the Chief Part of the Lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Men are debauch'd in Principles.
However, Monarchy has this Advantage,
that the one Man, their Prince, is mortal,
and if bad, he may be ſucceeded by a
better; but a people thoroughly corrupted
never returns to right Reaſon; And we
ſee that the depravity of Manners, which
began in <hi>Rome</hi> preſently after the ſecond
<hi>Punic</hi> War, among the Nobility and
Gentry, became every year worſe and
worſe, till at laſt <hi>Caeſar</hi> deſtroyed the
Commonwealth. And after his time,
under the ſucceeding Emperors, every
Senate grew more abject and complying
than the other, till in Proceſs of Time
the old <hi>Roman</hi> Spirit was utterly extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh'd,
and then that Empire by degrees
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:93970:118"/>
became a Prey to Barbarous Nations.</p>
               <p>If all parts of the State do not with
their utmoſt power promote the Publick
Good, if the Prince has other Aims than
the ſafety and welfare of his Country, if
ſuch as repreſent the People do not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
their Courage and Integrity, If
the Nations Treaſure is waſted, If Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters
are allow'd to undermine the
Conſtitution with Impunity, If Judges
are ſuffer'd to pervert Juſtice and wreſt
the Law, then is a mixt Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
the greateſt Tyranny in the world;
it is Tyranny eſtabliſh'd by a Law, 'tis
authoris'd by Conſent, and ſuch a Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
are bound with Fetters of their own
making. A Tyranny that governs by the
Sword, has few Friends but Men of the
Sword, But a Legal Tyranny (where the
People are only call'd to confirm Iniquity
with their own Voices) has of its Side
the Rich, the Fearful, the Lazy, thoſe
that know the Law, and get by it, Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious
Churchmen, and all thoſe whoſe
Livelihood depends upon the quiet Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture
of Affairs; Aud the Perſons here
diſcrib'd compoſe the Influencing Part of
moſt Nations; So that ſuch a Tyranny
is hardly to be ſhaken off. Men may be
ſaid to be inſlav'd by Law, or their own
Conſent, under Corrupt or degenerate
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:93970:119"/>
Republicks, ſuch as was the <hi>Roman</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth
from the time of <hi>Cinna,</hi> till
the Attempts of <hi>Caeſar,</hi> and under dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate
mix'd Governments, ſuch as <hi>Rome</hi>
was while the Emperors made a ſhow of
Ruling by Law, but with an aw'd and
corrupted Senate: To which Form of
Government, <hi>England</hi> was almoſt reduc'd,
till the King came over to put our Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
upon a better Foot.</p>
               <p>But what has been, may be, and tho
we are ſafe during his Reign, yet in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Ages, bad and deſigning Miniſters
may think their Conduct is no way to be
maintain'd but by the Sword, and that
they cannot ſecurely prey upon the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth,
till they have made their
Maſter abſolute, upon which Score, in
theſe Inquiries concerning the Methods
whereby <hi>England</hi> may be a Gainer in
the General Ballance of Trade, we think
it needful to lay down, That all that
Wealth and Power which muſt defend
this State upon any Emergencies or Inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
from abroad, depends upon our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving
inviolate the antient Conſtitution
of this Kingdom.</p>
               <p>Men do as induſtriouſly contrive Falla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
to deceive themſelves (when they
have a Mind to be deceiv'd) as they ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
Frauds whereby to deceive Others;
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:93970:119"/>
And if it leads to their Ends, and gratifies
their preſent Ambition, they care not
what they do, thinking it time enough
to ſerve the Public, when they have
ſerv'd themſelves; and in this view ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
many betray their Truſts, Comply,
Give up the Peoples Rights, and let
Fundamentals be invaded, flattering
themſelves, that when they are grown
as great as they deſire to be, 'twill be
then time enough to make a ſtand, and
redeem the Commonweulth. The ſame
Notion led <hi>Pompey</hi> to joyn with thoſe
who intended to Subvert the <hi>Roman</hi> Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties;
But he found them too ſtrong,
and himſelf too weak, when he deſir'd
to ſave his Country.</p>
               <p>In the ſame manner, if there be any
in this Nation who deſire to build their
Fortunes upon the Publick Ruin, they
ought to conſider that their great Eſtates,
high Honours and Preferments, will a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail
'em little when the Subverſion of
Liberty has weaken'd and impoveriſh'd
us ſo, as to make way for the bringing in
of Foreign Power.</p>
               <p>It imports all Degrees of Men in their
ſeveral Poſts, to endeavour at the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving
that Form of Government, under
which we have proſper'd for near ſeven
hundred Years. It happens ſeldom that
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:93970:120"/>
any Country is totally ſubdu'd by Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
Force, and Civil War is indeed a
raging Fever; but it goes away of itſelf,
when the Humours that fed it are ſpent,
and is often no more than the Sign of a
Health too florid, and the Effects only of
too much Blood in the Body Politick:
But ill Conduct in a State long continued,
waſtes it by ſlow and certain degrees, and
at laſt brings an incurable Conſumption
upon all its Parts and Members.</p>
               <p>If the Affairs of this Kingdom ſhould
ever happen to be ill conducted, which
we hope is a Remote Fear, the Legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Power muſt then interpoſe with its
Authority, and the united Wiſdom of
the Nation muſt reſcue Us out of weak
and polluted hands, for ſuch a Miniſtry
is a ſurer Engine to deſtroy a State, than
any its Enemies can bring againſt it.</p>
               <p>'Tis true, ſuch as would correct Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors,
and watch that no Invaſion may
be made on Liberty, have been hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
call'd a Faction by the Perſons in
Power; but 'tis not properly their Name,
and ought to be given to another ſort of
Men.</p>
               <p>'Tis wrong to call them the Faction,
who by all dutiful and modeſt Ways
promote the Cauſe of Liberty, as the
true means to endear a Prince to his
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:93970:120"/>
Subjects, and to lay upon them a ſtronger
tye and obligation to preſerve his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.
For a People will certainly
beſt love and defend that Prince, by
whom the greateſt Immunities and moſt
good Laws have been granted.</p>
               <p>They cannot properly be term'd the
Faction, who deſire a War ſhould be
manag'd upon ſuch a Foot of Expence as
the Nation is able to bear; Who would
have the Publick Treaſure not waſted,
the Prince not deceiv'd in his Grants and
Bargains, who would have the Miniſtry
watchful and Induſtrious, and who,
when they complain, are angry with
Things and not with Perſons.</p>
               <p>The Name of Faction does more truly
belong to them, who, tho the Body Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litick
has all the Signs of Death upon
it, yet ſay all is well, that the Riches of
the Nation are not to be exhauſted, that
there is no miſgovernment in all its Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs,
that it feels no decay, and that its
OEconomy is perfect, and who, all the
while, are as arrogant and aſſuming as
if they had ſav'd that very People, whom
their Folly and mad Conduct has in a
manner ruin'd.</p>
               <p>They may be rather term'd the Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
who were good Patriots out of the
Court, but are better Courtiers in it, and
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:93970:121"/>
who pretended to fear exceſs of Power
while it was not communicated to them,
but never think the Monarchy can be
high enough advanc'd, when they are in
the Adminiſtration.</p>
               <p>In Nations (where for a long time
Matters have not been plac'd upon a Foot
of Honeſty) their great Aſſemblies con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt
commonly of two Parties, in both of
which Sides there are many who have
the ſame right Intentions to the Public,
and many, who in all their Councils con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult
only their private Intereſt.</p>
               <p>Of one ſide, ſome out of Principle love
their Country, and are jealous of its Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties;
and yet at the ſame time are care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
of their Princes Honour and Intereſt. In
all their Proceeding they have nothing in
view but the Public Good, They ſtudy not
ſo much how to blame the Paſt, as which
way the Future is to be mended; They
do not accuſe the Stateſman, and yet let
the Fault continue, as well knowing, that
Impeachments of Men, and not of Crimes
produce new, but ſeldom better Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters.</p>
               <p>They deſire the Neceſſities of the State
ſhould be well ſupply'd, the Perſon of
the Prince reverenc'd, and his Government
maintain'd. When his Miniſters have
made falſe ſteps, or when their Councils
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:93970:121"/>
have had unſucceſsful Events, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
not to inflame the Aſſembly where
they ſit, but are willing rather to aſſiſt
with their ſuperior knowledge, and to
bring the minds of Men to the Temper
and Calmneſs that is proper in weighty
Deliberations.</p>
               <p>Perſons of this Character are in moſt
Aſſemblies of a People, but they are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
joind and follow'd by ſuch as have
quite another View and Aim, and who
in all their Actings, conſult not the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Welfare, but either wreak their own
Diſcontents, or purſue ſome Ambitious
Hope, and upon ſuch, or the like Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compts,
mix themſelves with the wiſer
and better ſort; However the Good
and the Bad, being thus mingled and
blended, compoſe altogether what in viti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
times is called the Country Party.</p>
               <p>On the other ſide, there are ſome very
nice in what may intrench upon the Regal
Authority, yet never forgetful of the
Peoples Rights; 'Tis true, their Poſt of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
compells them to excuſe all Faults,
tho guilty of none themſelves, They are
forc'd too frequently to move for Mony,
but wiſh there was leſs occaſion for it:
They hate not ſuch as differ from 'em in
Opinion, and ſecretly approve of the Right
Courſe, which ſometimes they muſt not
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:93970:122"/>
follow; but with ſuch as have been here
deſcrib'd, there will too often join an
Ignorant, Mercenary, and Servile Crew,
who like all things, and examin nothing,
Unanimous in Evil, Diligent in Miſchief,
Variable in Principles; Conſtant to Flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery,
Talkers for Liberty, but Slaves to
Power. Such as theſe will too frequently
in vitious times mingle with the ſound
Part of a Court, ſtiling themſelves the
Court Party, and the Princes only
Friends.</p>
               <p>In former Reigns, by the Artifice
of deſigning Stateſmen, the Repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives
of the People were divided into
thoſe two Parties; Beſides, in moſt Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies
which meet by the Authority of
a ſingle Perſon, there are ſtill ſome who
are thought to have the Secret, and they
ſtile themſelves the <hi>Managers:</hi> The
Eyes of every one are bent upon them,
their words are obſerv'd, and in moſt
things they give the firſt Turn; At
Court indeed they pretend to ſway and
and govern every Motion: but in Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
eſteem'd indifferent, they carry with
'em many of the beſt ſort, and are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
followed by all ſuch as are willing
to be guided. Theſe are believ'd to
have weigh'd before hand, and to know
what is wiſeſt, moſt ſafe, moſt expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent,
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:93970:122"/>
or at leaſt moſt grateful; And when
they appear, it is imagin'd there has been
put into their Heads the whole extract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Quinteſcence of all the Miniſterial
Wiſdom. In the Houſe they undertake
for the Court, and at Court for the
Houſe, receiving ſingly, the Thanks of
what proceeds from the joynt Affection
of all the reſt, and are thought alone to
give what the whole Nation pays.</p>
               <p>To tell what time deſigning Men began
to erect for themſelves this new Office,
and when and how this Impoſition took
its Riſe, would be too long a Digreſſion
from the preſent Matter; but we may
truly affirm, Things have never gone
well with our Princes, nor their People,
ſince it was firſt invented.</p>
               <p>Good Kings at all times, without any
Danger, may repoſe their intire concerns
upon a Houſe of Commons, the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
Intereſt will go on there
without driving, and when Difficulties
ariſe, the Miniſters only make them; For
when the King and People have but one
Intereſt, it goes on of its own Accord,
and ſuch as ptetend to be buſy for the
Prince in that Place, are working for
themſelves, and not for him.</p>
               <p>But if in after Ages our Diſorders and
Corruptions ſhould make this Office Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary;
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:93970:123"/>
If there muſt be Managers, If
ſome muſt lead and others follow, 'tis rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
the Guides ſhould be well in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed.</p>
               <p>Nothing therefore can more import the
Prince, than that they who will aſſume
ſuch a Province, ſhould be Men of Grave
Diſcretion, and ſolid Judgment, Wiſe,
and not Subtle, Cool, Temperate, Steady,
Diſcerning, and Patient of Contradiction:
and indeed they cannot be proper for that
Poſt, unleſs they have in their Heads an
Univerſal Scheme of their own and the
Buſineſs of other Countreys.</p>
               <p>When Giddy Young Men without Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
are rely'd upon and truſted in this
Station, they embroyl the Princes Affairs;
By their Ignorance they give his Enemies
advantage, and by their Inſolence diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oblige
his Friends.</p>
               <p>A Man can be no more born a States<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
than a Phyſician, or a Lawyer; and
let the Mind be never ſo happily diſpos'd,

any Advantage of Natural or Extemporary

               </p>
               <p>The Sanguine Hopes conceiv'd by
Young Men are by no means proper in
Weighty and great Deliberations, and
they ſeldom make good States-men: El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Years, where they produce not Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
bring at leaſt Caution, which is
ſomething like it.</p>
               <p>They who have ſeen much are us'd
to frequent Diſappointments, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
not inclin'd to venture; eſpecially
they rarely hazzard the ſumm of affairs
upon any ſingle Council.</p>
               <p>Young Men are good to execute the
Reſults of elder Wiſdom, but the ſame
Fire which makes them beſt for Action,
renders them unfit for Council: Yet there
is now and then a fortunate Genius,
in whom the Prudence of Age, and the
Warmth of Youth meet together, but of
ſuch the Examples are not common.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pierce Gaveſton, Hugh Spencer,</hi> and the
Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> are ſufficient In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
that the Conduct of Young Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
is ſeldom Succeſsful to themſelves,
nor to their Maſters: They do the leſs
Miſchief if they meddle only in the Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
of their Prince; but when warm
Heads, full of Conceit, with ſlight Wit,
and no true Wiſdom, pretend to guide a
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:93970:124"/>
whole State, and to have Majority at
their Beck and Rule, in a ſhort time they
occaſion more Diſorders than can be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy'd
in many Years.</p>
               <p>When Perſons ſo deſcrib'd come to
have a Corrupt Majority of their ſide,
They diminiſh the Nations Stock and its
Coin, They loſe its Trade, They Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipate
all the Princes Revenues, They
charge the Subject for many Years to
come with a great Number of New Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
and Impoſitions, They bring the State
into an Immenſe Debt, and plunge it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
ſuch Difficulties, that hardly any new
Revenues can be well erected: But 'tis
hop'd <hi>England</hi> will never fall into ſuch
deſtructive Hands.</p>
               <p>Our Wealth and Greatneſs depend ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely
upon keeping the Legiſlative
Power to future Ages untainted, Vigilant
for the Public Safety, Jealous of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
Rights, Watchful over the Miniſters,
and to have the Members not aw'd by
Armies, nor to be ſeduc'd by Preferments,
Bribes or Penſions; That we are ſafe at
preſent is granted, and that we are not
now under any Dangers of the like kind,
and that this important Poſt is well ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur'd,
is allow'd: But writing for Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
to which theſe Papers may perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture
be tranſmitted, we think it need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to give theſe Cautions.</p>

While we preſerve our Conſtitution as
we receiv'd it from our Anceſtors, Bad Men
may have a ſhort Power to do Miſchief;
however their Rage and Folly will be at
laſt corrected; but if we ſuffer our Civil
Rights to be invaded, and if our ancient
Form of Government ſhould be loſt, then
ill Miniſters will proceed without Comp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trol,
they will in a ſhort time diſſipate
the Nations Treaſure, the People will have
no Stock for Trade, they will loſe their
Induſtry, they will grow inclinable to
change, Reſty and Indifferent in the cauſe
of Liberty, and perhaps willing to ſubmit
to any foreign Force, like <hi>Spain</hi> which
has been both deſpotically and weakly go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd.</p>
               <p>Freedom and Wealth proceed hand in
hand together, and if one is loſt the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
will not long continue: but this
Notion is not much regarded by thoſe
who can only be great, and have no ways
of making their own Fortunes, but by
the deſtruction of their Country.</p>
               <p>For ſuch as propoſe to thrive by Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order
and Miſgovernment, have a ſtrong
Intereſt to beggar the People, The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion
which Public wants and Private
Neceſſities introduce, ſuits beſt with their
Deſigns: A wealthy Nation may be jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
of its Rights, and watch any Inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:93970:125"/>
upon its Freedome, and a Rich
Gentry may be unmanageable; And
ſuch bad Men may think, that the beſt
Courſe to keep us humble is to make us
poor.</p>
               <p>If any ſhould be ſo wicked to have
Thoughts of enſlaving <hi>England,</hi> they
will endeavour to Mate and Quell the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>machs
of the Common People, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing
them to the Miſery and want
which decay of Trade, if it ever happens,
muſt bring upon this Nation; And they
will try to diſtreſs the Gentry in their
Eſtates to that Degree, as to make 'em
rely upon the Court for a Livelyhood
and Subſiſtance: for which Reaſons they
will wink at the loſs of our Foreign Traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick,
and perhaps contrive its Deſtruction,
knowing that upon the Proſperity of
Trade, Rents and Land have for many
years depended. Nor can ill Miniſters
deſire a better Circumſtance, than to have
Men of the beſt Fortunes reduc'd by their
Neceſſities to come and Cringe and Sue
to them for a ſmall Employment. Does
not this bring all into their Power? Muſt
not ſuch as ſhall have the Deſtribution of
of theſe Favours be courted and follow'd
by the major Part of the Gentry? Would
not ſo great a Capacity of helping others
add to their ſtrength, make 'em rich and
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:93970:125"/>
ſafe, and indeed ſet them in a manner
above Impeachments?</p>
               <p>If bad Men ſhould ever get into Power
they will not only contribute to ruin our
Foreign Trade, but they will try to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poveriſh
the Kingdom by exorbitant
Taxes, thereby to bring the Gentry and
People yet more under their Subjection;
They will likewiſe plunge their Maſter
into Debts and Neceſſities, to render their
Tricks and Arts of more uſe, and to put
a higher value upon the Band they ſhall
have in pay; for in former times we
have ſeen that when a Court wanted,
they who procur'd Money to be given,
were thought to give it; by which means
they obtain'd Favour cheaply at the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
of Others: And this ſingle Merit
atton'd for all their Faults, It excus'd falſe
Steps and Negligence, It ſhelter'd their
Bribery, and cover'd their Diſability for
the Public Service.</p>
               <p>Beſides, they will intangle their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
Affairs, becauſe a Prince that does
not need Money, may come not to need
them, whoſe Talents, in all likelihood,
will conſiſt in procuring Taxes, not in
well laying out the Summs granted;
Therefore a wanting State, a troubled
Government, and an indebted Exchequer
will be their Region; Large Premiums,
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:93970:126"/>
Exorbitant Intereſt, Diverting Appropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated
Fonds, Choice of Fonds on which
to place their own Money, Preferring one
Debt and Poſtponing another, will be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
good Matter for ill Stateſmen to
work upon, but afford much a better
Harveſt when the Government ſtands in
want of Money; Immenſe Summs given
every Year will be a brave and ample
Field for their Avarice to range in, which
would be cramp'd and confin'd, if bound
within the narrow Limits of what a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
may be able to pay.</p>
               <p>Of all things, they love a long and an
expenſive War, and fear Peace; for Peace
produces Order, and gives the Prince lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
to enquire into the Abuſes of the
State; It lets him into a right knowledge
of Perſons in the Kingdom, and the Dregs
which float upwards when the Liquor is
ſtirr'd, muſt ſink to the bottom in quiet
times; Peace reſtores Liberty of Speech,
whereas in War all is ſilenc'd with the
ſingle word <hi>Neceſſity;</hi> In Peace there is
no need to court Factions, Turbulent Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
are not ſo uſeful, Thrift may
be introduc'd, and ſuch ſudden Fortunes
cannot be rais'd out of the Publick. Grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances
may be calmly debated, The Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement
of the Revenues inſpected, The
Conduct of the Miniſters may be exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd;
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:93970:126"/>
And good Laws may be propos'd
without the Perpetual Objection of, <hi>Are

But War will better anſwer their Deſigns,
who mean to thrive by the looſe Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration
with which War is generally ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company'd,
and who propoſe to proſper by
the Calamities and Miſery of their Country.</p>
               <p>The Buſineſs of <hi>Ireland</hi> at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of the Revolution, is a pregnant
Inſtance how much deſigning Men love a
long War. That Kingdom might have
been preſently reduc'd, the Nation was
diſpirited, He who held the Government
was ready to give up the Marks and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns
of his Authority, with the Strengths
depending on it; They were ſtruck with
a Panic Fear, and had readily ſubmitted
if in any reaſonable time a ſmall Force
had been ſent thither; But one People
does rarely yield ſo much to the Fame of
another, as to ſurrender without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ask'd or ſummon'd. It was deſir'd that
a few Tropps might be carry'd over to
confirm and countenance our Friends, and
to give our Enemies a fair Colour for
purſuing that Courſe to which they were
enough perſwaded by their true Intereſt,
tho they could not modeſtly acquieſce,
unleſs ſomething had been done that
might ſave Appearances; for a great
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:93970:127"/>
Army could not with any Decency
disband, without ſo much as hearing of
an oppoſite Strength, to which (in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Fright that poſſeſs'd their Party)
they might have yielded with ſome Sav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to their Honour. But <hi>Ireland</hi> was
for a long time ſlighted, and the Natives
were ſuffer'd to gather into a formidable
Power. That Diverſion gave our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
Kingdom opportunity to take Breath,
and time to recover from the Fright and
Amazement which ſo potent a League
had brought upon them. The Troops
who periſh'd ſo miſerably at <hi>Dundalk</hi> and
elſewhere, would have been a great Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
to the Confederate Force. The
Vigor that actuates the Minds of men in
their firſt Proceedings ſhould have been
carry'd againſt <hi>France,</hi> and not have been
let to conſume itſelf, and ſlacken within
our own Dominions. If by good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
the Affairs of <hi>Ireland</hi> had been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
appeas'd, the Power of theſe three
Nations had been united, and we might
have enter'd the Liſts with our Strength
intire, and a Treaſure unwaſted, which
probably would have wrought ſuch Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects,
and begot ſuch a Terror as might
have produc'd long ago as ſound and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
a Peace as we enjoy at preſent,
after the Expence of ſo much Blood and
Money.</p>
               <p>

This War ſtood <hi>England</hi> in 4,128,672 <hi>l.</hi>
5 <hi>s.</hi> 3 <hi>d.</hi> ¼, and both Nations in 4,515,693 <hi>l.</hi>
0 <hi>s.</hi> 8 <hi>d.</hi> ¾, but if we come to reckon the
Burnings, Waſte and Depredation, and
the irreparable Loſs of Men, <hi>Engliſh</hi> and
<hi>Iriſh,</hi> by Sickneſs and in Battel, and the
<hi>Iriſh</hi> damage redounding to us at laſt, it
may be ſafely affirm'd that we are the
worſe for that War by at leaſt 7 Millions.</p>
               <p>However that fatal Neglect did divert
from the War againſt <hi>France</hi> above four
Millions, and did engage in Civil Broils thoſe
Arms which were ſo needful in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
to make a ſtrong Impreſſion upon
our Enemies abroad.</p>
               <p>But a certain Party of Men were too
buſy themſelves at home for to mind the
Nations Foreign Concerns. They were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding
the ſpoil here, They were hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
after Places, and ſharing among one
another the Dignities and Offices of the
State, which took up all their time, and
employ'd all their Care. Beſides, ſuch an
early Coalition and Union of the whole
ſtrength of the three Kingdoms, might
have terrified <hi>France</hi> too ſoon, and taken
away their Hopes of a ſucceeding War,
which is the Crop and Harveſt of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigning
Miniſters, the Field in which
they fatten, and a Spend-thrift, to
whom they are Stewards without Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="216" facs="tcp:93970:128"/>
If not minding the Affairs of <hi>Ireland</hi>
did hinder the Peace ſo long, then we
owe to that fatal Council the Beginning
of the Debt, which now preſſes ſo hard
upon us; for without the Colour of ſuch
a War, thoſe immenſe Summs could not
have been conſum'd, which for theſe laſt
five Years have been levy'd in this Kingdom</p>
               <p>When King <hi>James</hi> went away, we were
reduc'd to what Mr <hi>Hobbes</hi> calls the State
of Nature, the Original Contract being
diſſolv'd, and the Ligaments broken,
which held us before together: The Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
was then a Blank, apt to receive any
Impreſſion; The old Building was pull'd
down, and the Faults in it before might
have been corrected, if the Architects
had been skilful, and ſuch Lovers of their
Country as they pretended to be. Never
men had ſuch an Opportunity of doing
Good, as they who had the chiefeſt hand
in making the Revolution. They had a
Prince willing to conſent to whatever
might ſet us upon a right Foot, if they
had met his deſign of Landing here with
equal Virtues. The Gentry and People
were at that time newly awaken'd from
the Lethargy in which they had been for
many Years; They ſaw how narrowly
Religion and their Liberties had eſcap'd;
Their Fears had made 'em Wiſe and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber;
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:93970:128"/>
Their Eyes were univerſally open'd;
And they were wrought up to a Temper
(which ſeldom happens in a whole Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion)
of being capable to receive good
and honeſt Councils. It was in their
Power for ever to have baniſh'd Flattery
and Corruption from the Court, and from
another Place where thoſe Vices are yet
more hurtful; and when they had chang'd
Perſons, if they had taken Care at the
ſame Inſtant to mend Things, they had
wrought a general Reformation in our
Manners. It was in their Hands to have
given us a Sound Conſtitution, They had
before 'em the Errors of preceeding
Reigns, by which they might have cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
their Model, They ſhould have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd
upon a ſtrict OEconomy, neither plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
for themſelves, nor ſuffering Others
to grow Rich at the Public Coſt. They
ſhould have been as careful in the State, as
their Maſter was active in the Field, they
ſhould have begg'd leſs, and done more.
They ſhould have avoided Bribery, than
which nothing could be more unſeemly in
Reformers of a State; and which was cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
to keep out the beſt, and let the
worſt Men into all their Buſineſs. They
ought to have known that a new Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
was to be maintain'd by ſeverer
Rules and Methods than perhaps are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:93970:129"/>
in a Court where the Prince is
born in Purple. And laſtly, They ſhould
have made this Reflection, That more
than ordinary Virtue of all kinds was
needful to anſwer the Peoples Expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and that more than common Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
was requiſite to maintain and juſtifie
ſo great a Change.</p>
               <p>The worſt and moſt unhappy Kings
that ever were would have rul'd better,
had it not been for the wrong Suggeſtion
and wicked Incitements of the Flatterers
about 'em; But thoſe Peſts and Poiſons
of a Court are yet more to blame, when
things ſuceeed not well with Wiſe and
Virtuous Princes.</p>
               <p>That Declaration which the King ſent
to <hi>England</hi> before he came over, was the
Pole Star by which our State Pilots were
to ſteer their Courſe. 'Twas well known
that to keep the ſame Parliament ſitting
ſo many Years was what had chiefly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauch'd
the Gentry of this Kingdom, it
was therefore expected that in the Act for
declaring the Rights and Liberties of the
Subject, ſome Proviſion ſhould have been
made againſt thta Evil for the future. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Miniſters, who betray'd their King
and Country, have gone on to the laſt
with Impunity, by keeping Parliaments
quite off; but more have found a Shelter
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:93970:129"/>
for their Crimes in Houſes, which they
have long held together, and of which
they have had the handling for many
a Seſſions; Could Men pretend to be Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triots,
and not take Care of ſecuring that
Poſt? Could our Freedoms be any
way certainly loſt, but by laying aſide
the uſe of Parliaments, as was deſign'd in
the Reign of King <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt, or
by keeping them ſo long ſitting, till a
Majority of Members ſhould be under En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements
with the Court, as had almoſt
happen'd in the Reign of King <hi>Charles</hi>
the Second? Were we not both times
upon the very brink of ruin, and in ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard
of being no more a free People?
Did it not therefore import that Party
which had heretofore made ſuch high Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions
for Liberty, to provide that <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi>
might be no more threatned with the
ſame danger? Should not this have been a
main Article in our Contract with their
Majeſties upon their Acceſſion to the
Throne, who readily conſented to all
things that might make us ſafe and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py,
The King having promis'd in his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration,
<hi>To do all things which the two
Houſes of Parliament ſhould find neceſſary
for the Peace, Honour and Safety of the
Nation, ſo that there may be no more
danger of the Nations falling at any
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:93970:130"/>
time hereafter under Arbitrary Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>'Twas certainly a great Omiſſion not
to bring on in the very beginning of the
Revolution, the Act for Triennial Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
which our own Corruptions pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd
at laſt; If the State had enter'd
early into that wholeſom Council, it had
made the Kings entire Reign more eaſy
to himſelf, and leſs coſtly to his People.
It had given a Riſe to that Virtue and
Publick Honeſty he came over to plant,
and had anſwer'd all the ends of his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration.
They who were not well
principled, muſt have pretended ſo to be,
for the Paths and Road to Preferment
had been thereby quite alter'd: The In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredients
which before compos'd a Stateſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
were Skill to govern the Houſe, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
now and then to make an Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
Turn, knowledge of the Members,
that is, who were to be taken off, and
what was their Price, Diligence in keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that Band together who were right
or wrong to be unanimous. They who
were thus qualify'd themſelves, or who
would blindly follow the Profeſſors of
theſe pernicious Arts, engroſs'd the whole
Buſineſs and Employments of the Nation;
But by neglecting to put Matters under a
good Settlement in the beginning, one
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:93970:130"/>
and the ſame Houſe of Commons came
to continue ſitting with ſhort Intervals
for Six Years, and this wrong meaſure be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
taken, renew'd all the former Errors
of our Conſtitution, and for a time re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor'd
to Men the ſame diſhoneſt Intereſt
they had before, and, if any were ſo
wicked, gave them freſh opportunity and
room to endeavour once more the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion
and Ruin of this Kingdom, not
by the very ways practis'd in former
times, but by the ſame corrupt Inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and Councils dreſs'd in other Shapes;
And tho, without doubt, none of 'em
are choſen into this Parliament, yet 'tis
to be fear'd, that in thoſe Seſſions of Six
Years continuance, there was rear'd up
a new brood of Men of Buſineſs, as high
Flatterers, more falſe, deſigning, and
rapacious than their Predeceſſors, but
without the ſame Skill and Dexterity to
ſupport their Malice.</p>
               <p>However, 'tis hop'd the Act for Trien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial
Parliaments may have given a Check
to this Ulcer, which was growing in the
Body Politick, and that it may hinder the
Gangreen from proceeding further; yet
tho the old Venome may be reſtrain'd a
while by Remedies, 'tis to be fear'd it
lurks ſtill within us, ready to break out
upon the firſt Occaſion.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="222" facs="tcp:93970:131"/>
If that Party which once ſeem'd ſo
Jealous of our Rights had not abandon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
all their old Principles, they might
have form'd us a laſting Eſtabliſhment,
ſuch as could not have been ſhaken by
Domeſtick Rage or Foreign Power:
whereas now we depend alone upon the
Reputation, Merit and Virtues of the
King, that bind and hold us together;
But when he muſt yield to Nature (which
Misfortune we hope is very diſtant from
us) in all Humane Probability, nothing
can be expected but Confuſion and Civil
War.</p>
               <p>When the Breaches made upon our
Conſtitution in the late Reigns, had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd
many of the beſt Sort to judge a
Revolution needful, the People had rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
to expect that in a new Modell'd Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
all things ſhould have been
ſet upon the Foot of Honeſty and Virtue,
and to ſee all that Male-Adminiſtration
reform'd, which ſome perſons had been
reaſonably complaining of for 30 Years.
We thought to ſee a virtuous Court, a
watchful State, an Induſtrious and frugal
Miniſtry. If all theſe our Expectations
had been anſwer'd, what Diſaſters from
without or within could have hurt <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland?</hi>
Muſt not the Change have been
tacitly conſented to, (if not applauded)
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:93970:131"/>
even by thoſe that ſuffer'd in it? Had
we not at home a diſcontented Party,
which was to be ſilenc'd by ſhowing 'em
an honeſter, more ſteady, more difinte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſted,
and a wiſer Conduct than what
they had known before, and ſtill linger'd
after? Had we not abroad a Potent Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
againſt whom our Strength was to
be husbanded diſcreetly, that it might
laſt the longer? And laſtly, was not
the beſt and moſt irreproachable Manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in the world neceſſary and hardly
ſufficient, to enable us to carry on that
War, with which ſo great an Alteration
was certain to be follow'd?</p>
               <p>But inſtead of building upon theſe
Foundations, and taking ſuch meaſures as
had render'd our Proceedings ſafe in their
Conſequences, and not obnoxious to any
Cenſure, ſome Perſons have given mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt
Proof that they were acted by no ſort
of Principle, and that in their Doings
they were rather ſway'd by Private Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt,
Revenge, Ambition, and their other
Appetites; than guided by any ſence of
the Publiick Good; for we no ſooner had
upon the Throne a Prince fear'd and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verenc'd
broad, and Idoliz'd here, but
ſome perſons immediately forgot the Cauſe
for which they call'd him over.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="224" facs="tcp:93970:132"/>
If we had ſhown any Deſire to aſſiſt
and imitate his Perfections, what a
fair Fame of our ſelves had we tranſmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to After Ages.</p>
               <p>If ſome Men had conſider'd wiſely they
would have found, that all things were
not ſecure, becauſe Religion was out of
danger, whoſe Concerns are ſoon for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten
when we begin to be preſs'd with
other Fears; Beſides, if Matters are not
ſo order'd, that <hi>Spain</hi> may not fall under
the Power of <hi>France,</hi> Popery, and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal
Monarchy are ſtill to be appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended.</p>
               <p>Proſperity, a flowing Trade, and great
Riches, may admit of Prodigality, Neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence
in the State, and falſe ſteps in the
Miniſtry, but a People exhauſted by long
Taxes deſire to ſee in thoſe above 'em
Thrift for the Public, Vigilance, and as
much good Conduct as can be expected
in humane Buſineſs. Power is ſeldom
Invidious to the Common People when
plac'd in virtuous Hands, nor are Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities
intolerable, which could not have
been avoided by any Care or Caution.
When the Miniſters do well, thoſe under
'em ſuffer quietly; but on the Contrary,
If they obſerve themſelves rul'd in the
Subordinate parts of Government, by
ſuch as make a prey of the Common-wealth,
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:93970:132"/>
and to that end only take upon
'em its Adminiſtration, if they plainly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
their miſeries and Misfortunes to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
chiefly from the Corrupt or weak Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils
of ſuch Stateſmen, they become diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearten'd
and loſe that Mettle and Spirit,
without which the high deſigns of their
powerful Neighbours are not to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted.</p>
               <p>But tho ſome Errors might be commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in the beginning of the Revolution,
'tis hoped all things are now well, that
Peace has put an End to thoſe Diſorders
in Government which War does com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
beget, and that our preſent Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement
is not lyable to any Cenſure.
And what is ſaid here, and what may be
obſerv'd hereafter of the like kind in the
Series of this Diſcourſe, is not at all the
preſent caſe of <hi>England;</hi> 'tis hoped we
are not a Corrupt People, but in Proceſs
of time we may grow ſo, and loſe that
Virtue which is preſumed to ſhine in this
Age. This Section is therefore directed
to Poſterity, which alone is concern'd in
the Ethicks here advanced.</p>
               <p>In future Ages perhaps Ambitious and
Deſigning Men may deſire to embroyl
their Maſters affairs only, to make him
more Dependant upon their Arts; here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after
Men of Arbitrary Principles may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignedly
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:93970:133"/>
neglect the Concerns and Care of
Foreign Traffick, with a Purpoſe to Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poveriſh,
and ſo to enſlave the People; In
the next Age likewiſe deſigning Miniſters
may take Advantage of the Martial Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
of a Prince, and inſtead of reigning
in his High Courage with grave Councils,
they may diſguiſe from him the true
State of his Affairs, and puſh him on to a
new War, without making right Proviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
or without ſuch previous Leagues as
may make it tollerable in the Progreſs,
or happy in the Concluſion; and perhaps
they may deſire the Semblance of a War,
only to have a Pretence for a Standing
Army.</p>
               <p>For the Benefit therefore of future times,
it may be proper to ſhow by what ſteps
thoſe Vices and Immoralities that affect
the Public firſt creep into a Country, and
what Progreſs they come afterwards to
make, and to ſhow what ſort of Men and
what kind of Councils intangle a Princes
Affairs.</p>
               <p>But tho this Paper be directed to Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
and tho 'tis nothing but a Caution
to future times, yet probably it may of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
ſome Perſons who are tender in theſe
Matters.</p>
               <p>However we ſhall venture to affirm that
if this Nation ſhould ever be under any
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:93970:133"/>
great Diſorder, the trueſt Courſe to mend
it, will be to plant in the Minds of the
better ſort Morality, and the Shame of
doing ill to their Country, And we ſhall
preſume to aſſert that obſerving the Rules
and Dictates of Virtue, does not only lead
to Heaven and a bleſſed State hereafter,
but is the beſt way of ſecuring to a Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
in general, Proſperity, Peace, Safety,
Power, and Happineſs in this preſent
World.</p>
               <p>To trace thoſe Men who may deſign to
change this Conſtitution in all their dark
and crooked Ways, and to follow 'em in
all their Mazes will be difficult; however
we ſhall do our beſt to deſcribe the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
and to ſhow their Councils, that
they may be narrowly watch'd by all ſuch
as love their Country.</p>
               <p>But to do this we muſt take a ſhort
view of things paſt, and a little conſider
the Poſture of Affairs at the Reſtoration
of King <hi>Charles</hi> the 2d, and how they
ſtood during his Reign and the Reign of
his Succeſſor.</p>
               <p>When that Prince was recall'd from
Exile, by the Voice of the whole People
(who had been tired with the many
Changes in Government, that happened
from <hi>Cromwell</hi>'s Death to the year 1660)
'twas almoſt impoſſible, but that we
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:93970:134"/>
ſhould run from one to the other Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream;
And 'twas reaſonable to fear that
Men ſhould readily embrace Servitude,
who knew not how to make a right uſe
of Liberty. Upon which Accompt many
have wonder'd why our Antient Form of
Government was not at that time alter'd,
and how it came to paſs we did not then
embrace Abſolute Monarchy.</p>
               <p>But we are to conſider that King
<hi>Charles</hi> was a young Prince, more inclined
to taſte the Pleaſures of Power, than wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to feel its Weight; He had under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone
many Troubles, which he intended
to recompence with great Eaſe and Luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;
ſo that the rugged work of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting
the Laws ſuited neither with his
Age nor Temper. Had he lived longer,
as Time and Oppoſition began to ſowr
his Blood, what he might have attempted
is very doubtful.</p>
               <p>Beſides the unactive Genius of the King,
there happen'd then another Circumſtance
very fortunate for <hi>England,</hi> which was,
that the Services and Merit of the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor
<hi>Clarendon,</hi> and the Treaſurer
<hi>Southampton,</hi> did ſtrongly induce him to
put the Adminiſtration of his Affairs into
their Hands. They were both Perſons
of Age and Experience, They had known
the former Reign, They had ſeen the
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:93970:134"/>
Grounds and Riſe of the Civil War, They
underſtood the Nature of our Conſtitution,
They ſaw what had depos'd one King,
and found that unlimited Power was
hard to compaſs, and difficult to keep;
And having their Maſters Ear, and at firſt
a large ſhare in his Affection, They kept
Him within Bounds. The Skill in the
Laws of One, the Eloquence of the
Other, the General Abilities of both,
made 'em eſteem'd by the People, and
awful to their very Prince, and this gave
a weight to all their Councils. They had
Authority enough in their Perſons to be
liſten'd to, when they ſpoke bold and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
Truths: having Superiour Knowledge
and Deſert too, to be heard, they did not
ſtand in need of ſaying always what was
pleaſing, which is the miſerable and ſervile
Condition of Upſtart, Weak and Obſcure
Stateſmen; But leſs were they oblig'd to
Flatter every Flatterer. Having a Foundation
of Merit, they ſcorn'd the mean Aid of
Parties, or to be the wretched Journey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
of any dark Cabal: Knowing what
was their Maſters and the Nations
Intereſt, and intending to promote both;
They gave wholſome Advice, without
Fear of offending either Prince or People.
That Kingly Government was then kept
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:93970:135"/>
within the Limits of the Law, That our
Conſtitution was not given up be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Fears of One, and the Hopes
of the Other Party, and that our Civil
Rights were ſtill preſerv'd, was chiefly
owing to the Wiſdom, Courage, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity
of thoſe two able Stateſmen.</p>
               <p>But even then, and all along after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
there were ſtill ſome among us
impatient to make their Maſter Abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute;
They conſiſted principally of ſuch
as had large Ambition, and Slender Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
who are the beſt Inſtruments for
any Tyranny. Theſe were ever em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broiling
the King with his Parliament,
either to protect them, or to juſtifie
ſome of their illegal Actions. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
they got him to appear a violent
Church-man, and at other ſeaſons to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
the Diſſenters, but at no time to
take Care of Religion itſelf. They per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded
Him to extend the Regal Power
in every thing; They got him to ſeize
all the Charters, in order to influence
Elections. By their Councils He rais'd
an Army, under Colour of declaring
War with <hi>France;</hi> By their Inſtruments
They made him abſolute in <hi>Scotland,</hi> at
the ſame time doing what they could to
weaken the Proteſtant Intereſt in <hi>Ireland.</hi>
                  <pb n="231" facs="tcp:93970:135"/>
But their chief Aim was to procure Him
ſo large a ſtanding Revenue, as might
make Parliaments uſeleſs for the future.
'Tis true, they propos'd this Revenue
for his Life only; but if that firſt ſtep
had been made, it had not been difficult
afterwards to entail it on the Crown: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides,
what has been granted to one Prince,
has been always continu'd to his Succeſſor
without any Struggle.</p>
               <p>That theſe Things were done with a
Deſign to change the Conſtitution, is vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
enough: And 'tis as evident that
theſe Councils were either promoted by
Perſons, who wanted the Sublime Part of
Wiſdome, neceſſary for the Conduct of
Great Affairs, and therefore were to
form a Government that might ſubſiſt by
Tricks and Arts, or they were forg'd by
a ſet of Men, whoſe Avarice and Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
no Regular Eſtabliſhment could ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſfie,
whoſe Crimes a Free State would
look into, and whoſe Arbitrary Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
a Parliament would not ſuffer: They
were therefore to build their Fortunes,
Gratifie their High Deſires, and find Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punity,
by ſetting up the Regal Power
above the Laws.</p>
               <p>In the next Reign, yet more open In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſions
were made upon our Liberties,
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:93970:136"/>
not by the ſame Men, but by Men acting
upon the ſame Principles; But they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
more cunningly before than after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards:
For in the former Reign 'twas
thought beſt to begin with altering the
Conſtitution, and that when this was
done, Religion might be chang'd of
courſe: But the hot Zeal of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks
would not permit 'em to go by Slow
and Regular Meaſures; They therefore
made a ſtrange and unpolitick Attempt,
never like to ſuceeed, which was firſt to
Convert, and then to Inſlave the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>While theſe Matters were tranſacting,
there appeared all along Perſons, both in
and out of the Court, who did moſt Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuouſly
oppoſe thoſe Deſigns, that, firſt
ſecretly, and then openly, were forming
againſt their Country.</p>
               <p>As ſome were contriving to Subvert our
Civil Rights, others did as carefully
watch their Preſervation, which Inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
and Defending, divided <hi>England</hi>
into what was then call'd the Court and
Country Party.</p>
               <p>Never was Liberty more cunningly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacked,
nor more Nobly Protected, than
in that Houſe of Commons which ſat
Eighteen Years. It contained bold bad
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:93970:136"/>
Men, with Hearts and Heads fit to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive
the Subverſion of a State. But there
were in it alſo Perſons of another Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter,
very Great indeed, with quite
Superior Judgments, and with Minds ſo
rightly adapted for Government, that the
Weight of a whole Empire might be
ſafely repos'd upon their Shoulders, in
whom Converſation with the dead Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of paſt Ages, was join'd with Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience,
and a perfect Knowledge of this
preſent World. Theſe brave Spirits from
the Beginning reſiſted that Inundation of
Flattery and ſervile Complyance, with
which great Revolutions in Corrupt times
are certain to be attended. They Vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly
oppoſed that Unanimous Band,
which diligently promoted Arbitrary
Power. Sometimes they ſav'd us when
we were within three or four Votes of
utter Ruin; They hindered that Increaſe
of the Kings Revenue, which alone
would have put an end to Parliaments.
Theſe were the Prime Leaders of ſuch
whom the People for ſome Years were
pleas'd to Term the Country Party, and
by Good Patriots, ſo call'd, our Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution
was for a while preſerv'd.</p>
               <p>But after the Year 1679. on both ſides
the Minds of Men grew ſo inflam'd, and
ſuch Animoſities did ariſe between 'em, that
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:93970:137"/>
they could no longer call one another
by the Civil Appellation of Court and
Country Party, ſo that the different
ſides began to be diſtinguiſh'd by other
ſort of Names.</p>
               <p>'Tis indeed below the Gravity of a
Sober Writer to uſe the Common Cant
words of the Town, but 'tis ſometimes
unavoidable, eſpecially when that which
was only Mirth and Cant at firſt, became
at laſt a ſerious Matter.</p>
               <p>The Accidental words of <hi>Guelf</hi> and <hi>Ghibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin,</hi>
in Proceſs of time grew to be the Names
of Powerful Parties, into which ſeveral
Countreys were divided, and in which
Emperors, Kings, Popes and Princes en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd,
and theſe Names of diſtinction con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
for ſome Ages, producing Wars
and Actions of great Importance.</p>
               <p>In the ſame manner the Words of
<hi>Whig</hi> and <hi>Tory,</hi> intended at firſt as reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procal
Reproaches, in a ſhort time
grew to be the Names by which two
great Parties were contented to be call'd,
and into which in a manner the whole
Nation was divided.</p>
               <p>They were termed Whigs, and indeed
they called themſelves ſo, who under
another Name, had heretofore oppoſed
the Corrupt aud illegal Proceedings of
the Court, who foreſaw the Dangers
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:93970:137"/>
that would ariſe from a Catholick King,
who were for correcting the Exorbitances
of <hi>Weſtminſter Hall,</hi> and for putting a
ſtop to extravagant Fines, aud who made
a reſolute ſtand, and would give no more
Money, till the <hi>Habeas Corpus</hi> Act was
paſſed, and till the new rais'd Army
was disbanded; and who did their ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
againſt the Surrender and Regulating
of Charters.</p>
               <p>In the next Reign the ſame Men, or
Men acting upon the ſame Principle, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd
themſelves againſt taking off the
Teſt and Penal Laws. They ſhow'd an
open Diſlike in Parliament of Catholicks
being put into Offices of Truſt. They
abhorr'd the Cruel Executions in the Weſt.
They oppos'd the Violent Proſecution of
the Seven Biſhops. And laſtly, They
were ready and active with their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils
and Aſſiſtance to bring over the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer
of <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A Man is but young at Nineteen, but a
Party may be thought old that is of ſo
long a ſtanding. The Perſons juſt now
deſcribed were the <hi>Old Whigs,</hi> whoſe
Principles will be reverenc'd in future Ages
by all ſuch as love their Country. 'Tis
true, ſome Perſons did join with theſe,
and call themſelves <hi>Whigs,</hi> who had all
along other Views than the Nations Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:93970:138"/>
whom Diſappointments had ſowr'd,
who oppos'd to be taken off, and who
did not like a Court, becauſe a Court did
not like them. But they who ſwim againſt
the Tide, muſt make uſe of all Helps, and
in Corrupt Times, even the beſt Patriots
have refus'd no ſort of Men that could a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
ways aſſiſt the Public: the Good and
Bad of theſe altogether were call'd the
<hi>Whig Party.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To what had been formerly ſtil'd, the
Court Side, the People afterwards gave
the Name of <hi>Tories.</hi> And we ſhall give
an Account of what ſort of Perſons this
Party was compos'd. The Bulk of 'em
conſiſted of ſuch as were deſcended from
the Cavaliers, whoſe Families had ſuffer'd
very much by the Civil War, and who
by Education were ſeaſon'd with an early
Love to Kingly Government. They were
Jealous that all Motions tending to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
Liberty, ſavour'd of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth,
with whoſe Weight their Fathers
had been ſo lately Cruſh'd. A moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
Generation of Men, to have any
Fears that a Commonwealth could be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor'd
in a Country ſo corrupted! Many
of them were much of that Principle of
which <hi>Tacitus</hi> deſcribes <hi>Marcellus Eprius</hi>
to have been, who ſaid in the Senate, <hi>Se
meminiſſe
Temporum qui bus natus ſit, quam

Many of 'em were debauch'd by Pomp
and Splendour, and in the Heat of their
Youth, they lik'd the Pleaſures of a Court,
but the Riots of it compell'd many of
'em, at laſt, to depend upon its Favours.
Others embrac'd the Regal Power more
warmly, becauſe they ſaw many of the
Oppoſite Side bitter againſt the Church,
not ſo deſirous to Correct any of its Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors,
as willing to lay the Ax to its very
Root. Others link'd themſelves with
this Band out of a Cautious Temper, and
through a Fear that contending with the
Court might produce another War. Some
gave into this ſide out of Gratitude to
King <hi>Charles,</hi> and Many through meer
Affection to his Perſon; for without
doubt He was a moſt engaging Prince.
Others went into it from a real Convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of their Minds that the King was not
ſafe without more Power, to which Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
they were chiefly led, by obſerving
the Raſh Councils, unquiet Spirits, and
inſolent Behaviour of ſome of their Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponents.
But with thoſe who might Act
of this Side upon a Principle, there joyn'd
a great many who had no good Intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to the Publick, who were for enlarg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:93970:139"/>
the Prince's Power, in order to aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
their own, who were for Robbing
the People, that they might ſhare in the
Plunder, who would have ſet the King
above all the Laws, that they might be
never accountable to a Parliament for
their Proceedings; and, who pretending
a great Zeal for the Church, were all the
while making way for Popery; thus up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Different Motives, conſiderable Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
were liſted of this Side, and the Good
and the Bad mingled together, compos'd
what was call'd the <hi>Tory Party.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But Humane Affairs are ſubject to ſuch
odd Turns, that in the next Reign many
of both theſe Parties travers'd their
Ground, and mutually paſs'd into that
Camp which ſome of their Enemies had
deſerted. Not a few of the Whigs en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd
into the worſt of King <hi>James</hi>'s Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
and Councils; And the Eyes of
thoſe who had been reckon'd Tories,
were in a manner univerſally open'd, and
they began to ſee the Errors they had
been committing ſo many Years, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
that they were as eager as any
Others to promote the Revolution: So
that the Soundeſt Part of theſe Claſhing
Factions ſhook Hands together, and
join'd in that Reſcue of our Liberties
which could never have been brought
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:93970:139"/>
about, but by the Concurrent Endeavour
of both Parties.</p>
               <p>Both ſides had their Faults, and of both
ſides bad Men were liſted, and of each
ſide there were many who all along acted
upon the Principles of Honeſty and Virtue,
and who aim'd at the Common Good,
tho as to the Way to it, in their turns,
each ſide might be now and then mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken;
It muſt indeed be granted, that
the Whigs ſaw the Diſeaſes that were
growing upon the Body Politick, before
the Tories, But when the Diſtemper began
to rage, the Tories were not behind hand
in ſeeking out the Proper Remedy.</p>
               <p>But tho ſuch as the Common People
then call'd Tories, joyn'd in the Revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution,
and had without doubt the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
Hand in it, having on their Side Men
of Fortunes, Power, and Figure, and the
main Body of the Church, which will
always be found the ſtrongeſt Intereſt in
<hi>England,</hi> yet it muſt be confeſs'd that the
Change was made upon the old Whig
Principles, of making Parliaments awful
to the Miniſters, and of keeping the Regal
Authority within the Limits of the Law;
for what this Nation then did, was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
Oppoſite to the Church or Tory
Maxims; but when Princes quit the old
Rules of right Government, their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:93970:140"/>
will be apt to forget the old Rules
preſcrib'd for their Obedience,</p>
               <p>'Tis hop'd theſe Names of Diſtinction
are now quite aboliſh'd and forgotten;
But the Faction of <hi>Guelfs</hi> and <hi>Ghibelins,</hi>
after having ſlept for ſome time, reviv'd
again, and continu'd upward of two
hundred years, even when the Derivati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Words was no more remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber'd;
And the Parties laſted ſo long,
becauſe the ſame. Principles upon which
they had firſt differ'd, remain'd ſtill deeply
imprinted in their Minds, and afforded
continual Matter for new Diſſention.</p>
               <p>In the ſame Manner perhaps ſome time
hence the Names of Whig and Tory
may be again renew'd here, to diſturb this
Nations Peace; And if this ſhould happen,
we muſt implore the Whigs not to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
their old Principles and antient Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xims.</p>
               <p>The Tories, by taking Arms to defend
their Civil Rights, and by joining to
Depoſe that Prince by whom thoſe Rights
were violated, have in the moſt Public
Manner in the World renounced their
Doctrine of <hi>Jus Divinum,</hi> Paſſive Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
and Non-Reſiſtance.</p>
               <p>But if the Whigs ſhould hereafter take
their Stations, if they ſhould go upon that
Ground which the Tories have quitted, if
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:93970:140"/>
they ſhould enter upon juſt ſuch Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures,
if they ſhould purſue the ſame
Councils, if they ſhould ſuffer themſelves
to be imbid'd with Tory Notions, our
Conſtitution muſt be intirely loſt.</p>
               <p>For they may undermine it without
Suſpition: who will be Jealous of thoſe
who have been Preaching up Liberty and
accuſing Arbitrary Miniſters for thirty
Years? who will ſuſpect ſuch profeſt
Patriots? They may change the Form of
our Government, and have the People of
their ſide, who can have no Jealouſy of
them, for the Whigs are the Favourites
of the People, as having ſo often pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd
<hi>England.</hi> No Perſon could be
Popular enough in <hi>Rome</hi> to think of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting
its Conſtitution, in the Purity
of the Commonwealth, but <hi>Manlius</hi> who
had ſav'd the Capitol.</p>
               <p>It will hardly be ſurmis'd, that they
can mean to inſlave us, who (by their
Speeches, Actions and Writings) for many
Years ſeemed rather inclin'd to a Republic,
than to Deſpotick Government. But if they
ſhould come to change their Minds, if
They ſhould throw off their former
Principles, we ſhall be undone by the
very Men whom we thought our ſureſt
Friends.</p>

If old Whigs ſhould hunt after Places
as much as ever the Tories did, and if
like them, upon Preferment, they ſhould
become quite new Men, in Voting,
Thinking, and Speaking, in a Moment
making a ſudden Turn from the whole
Courſe of their former Lives; If old
Whigs, as the Tories did, ſhould ever
take Bribes and Penſions to betray their
Truſt; If they ſhould do any thing to
break into the <hi>Habeas Corpus</hi> Act, which
is the Chief Guardian of our Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties;
If they ſhould oppoſe any good
Act for the frequent ſitting of Parliaments,
which want in the Conſtitution produc'd
all our former Miſeries, If they ſhould
openly oppoſe any reaſonable Proviſion
for Tyrals in Treaſon, the want of which
has loſt many a Noble Life, and for
which heretofore they had ſo loudly
called; If, as the Tories did, they ſhould
ſend their Emiſſaries about to influence or
corrupt Elections; If old Whigs to whom
<hi>Meum</hi> and <hi>Tuum</hi> was once ſo ſacred,
ſhould come to ruin a Society of Trading
Men, and at one blow deſtroy many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred

ſhould ever have ſuch a Thought;
If old Whigs ſhall perſwade any Future

<pb n="243" facs="tcp:93970:141"/>
Power they ſhould get Men turn'd out of
Employment, for purſuing the Dictates
of their Conſcience, and Underſtanding;
If like the Miniſters heretofore complain'd

any Summ, and to excuſe, nay, even to

               <p>If the Old Whigs ſhould reſtore to Men
the ſame diſhoneſt Intereſt they had here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore,
If they ſhould conſume us in their
Miniſterial, and ſell us in their Legiſlative
Capacity; If they ſhould deſire to have
things governed rather by Tricks and
little Arts, than according to the Direction
of the Laws, or the Bent of the People;
If they, who upon the Virtuous Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of keeping <hi>England</hi> a free Country,
in former times, oppos'd all Exciſes, ſhould
be brought to create ſo many new Offices
and Officers, as may influence Elections

thought the beſt way to preſerve
their Civil Rights, was to keep the Purſe,
and to have always ſomething to give,
ſhould be for ſettling ſuch an immenſe
Revenue on the Crown, as may make

were ſo careful in King <hi>Charles</hi>'s Reign,
not to burthen the Nation with Taxes,
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:93970:142"/>
ſhould give away the Peoples Wealth, as

Figure ſhou'd be ſway'd by their private
Intereſt, without any Regard to the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic

to be choſen, not for their Country's Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
but in order to ſerve themſelves;
If it ſhould grow apparent, that neither
Side is at bottom better principled than
the Other, that Court and Country Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
Whigs and Church-men, are nothing
but the Factions of Thoſe who Have, and
Thoſe who deſire Preferment; If in this
manner the whole Maſs of Blood in the
Body Politick ſhould be corrupted, the
Nation will throw off that Reverence to
Parliaments, which has hitherto preſerv'd
our Liberties, and like the Neighbouring
Countries either terrify'd or allur'd, they
will by degrees ſubmit to unlimited Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy;
And ſo we ſhall loſe one of the
beſt Conſtitutions that was ever ſet afoot
for the well Governing a People.</p>
               <p>Handling as we do the Methods where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
a Nation may Increaſe in Wealth and
Power, we thought it neceſſary to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe
thoſe Parties and Factions which
probably hereafter may come to influence
in its Councils; And this has been done
in order to incite Good Men to watch
over their Growth and Progreſs, and ſuch
Good Men chiefly as deſign to engage on

neither Side, but to bend all their Care
that no Side may be able to hurt the

Care of Liberty and preſerving our Civil
Rights ſhould be ſo much recommended
in a Paper relating to Trade? We anſwer,
that herein we follow<hi> Machiavel, </hi>who
ſays,<hi> That when a Free State degenerates
into a Tyranny, the leaſt Miſchief that it
can expect, is to make no farther Advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in its Empire; and no farther Increaſe
either in Riches or Power, but for the moſt
part it goes backward and declines.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This deep Stateſman has a ſaying in
another Place well worthy of eternal
Remembrance,<note place="margin">Lib. 1. c. 10.</note> 
                  <hi>That the Prince who aims at
Glory and Reputation in the World, ſhould
deſire a Government, where the Manners
of his Subjects are corrupted and depraved,
not to Subvert and deſtroy it like </hi>Caeſar,<hi> but
to rectifie and reſtore it like </hi>Romulus,<hi> than
which the Heavens cannot confer, nor Man
propoſe to himſelf greater Honor.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It may be objected, that in <hi>France,</hi> where
all Thoughts of Liberty are extinguiſh'd,
Trade and Riches have of late Years very
much increas'd. But this admits of an
eaſy Anſwer. An abſolute Prince, with
great Abilities and Virtues, by Care and
Wiſdom may make his Country flouriſh
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:93970:144"/>
for a time. However, if his Succeſſors
are weak or wicked, all ſhall be ſoon un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ravell'd
and go backward, and Poverty
ſhall ſoon invade the ſame People which
before began to thrive; for to make a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
very Rich and Powerful, there muſt
be a long Succeſſion of good Princes
(which ſeldom happens) or a long Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion
of good Laws and good Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
which may be always had in Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys
that preſerve their Freedom: And
without doubt 'tis on this Accompt that
<hi>Machiavel</hi> has aſſerted, <hi>That no Cities have
augmented their Revenues or enlarged their
Territories,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Lib. 2. c. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>but whilſt they were free and at
Liberty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And if in future times the Nobility and
Gentry of <hi>England</hi> (which God forbid)
ſhould traffick the Peoples Rights for Titles,<note place="margin">Tacit. lib. 2. Ann.</note>
Bribes or Places, <hi>vilia Servitii pretia,</hi> and
if they ſhould be induc'd fearfully, or
which is worſe, corruptly to give up this
Conſtitution, Poverty will creep inſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
upon us. We ſhall, as <hi>Machiavel</hi> ſays,
<hi>go backwards and decline,</hi> Land will
yield a great deal leſs than now, Rents
will be ill paid, And we ſhall not have
a Foreign Traffick, large and extended
enough to produce ſuch a Naval ſtrength
as may make us Safe at home and Terrible
abroad.</p>

'Tis therefore upon the Authority of
this great Man that we have laid down,<hi>That a Country cannot Increaſe in Wealth
and Power but by Private Men doing their
Duty to the Public, and but by a Steady
Courſe of Honeſty and Wiſdom, in ſuch as
are truſted with the Adminiſtration.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>However, if Things ſhould hereafter
proceed amiſs, 'Tis hop'd the ſtrong Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution
of this Government will in time
throw off thoſe Diſeaſes which may af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
it for a Seaſon, and that the united
Wiſdom of the Nation can recover us
from that Decay of Health to which we
may be reduc'd by a few Empiricks of
State; Their Giddy Management for a
while may be ſupported, and born out,
by the great Riches which peradventure
may have been collected here by the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry
and Prudence of former Ages;
but if what has been gathering ſeven
Centuries, they ſhould ſquander away in a
few Years, the Cries of that People whom
they ſo impoveriſh, will at laſt awaken
the Parliament to enquire into, and ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madvert
upon their Wild Proceedings.</p>
               <p>If the Wealth and Power of a Country
depend upon the Good Government and
Stability of its Affairs, it muſt certainly
import all the different Ranks of Men to
contribute their utmoſt that Things may
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:93970:145"/>
be well adminiſter'd: And in mix'd Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions
almoſt every Man is able in
ſome Degree to help towards this; for
if the People are honeſt and careful in
the Choice of their Repreſentatives, and
if thoſe Repreſentatives perform their
Duty, Arbitrary Power can never be ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled
here, and no Male Adminiſtration
that may hereafter happen can long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue.</p>
               <p>That we are in no Danger at preſent,
and that Matters proceed well, now is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd,
but for the ſecurity of future times
it may not be amiſs frequently to repeat
this Caution, that our Whole depends
upon keeping one Poſt well defended.</p>
               <p>The Publick Virtue which muſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
a State is <hi>A Conſtant and perpetual
Will to do our Country Good;</hi> And where
this Principle governs, tho in the Minds
of but a Few, yet if they perſevere with
undaunted Courage, the ſmall Number
may prevail at laſt to defeat the Malice
of the Corrupt Part, eſpecially when the
Endeavours of the Few are aſſiſted by a
Prince diſpos'd by Intereſt and Inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

               <p>If Good Men were but as Active and
Vigilant as their Oppoſites, 'twould not
be ſo eaſie a Matter to change the Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution

               <p>In the ſame manner, if hereafter a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal

ſhould deſign To change this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution,
To introduce a Government by

               <p>If therefore, in future times, it ſhall be

be angry with no ſort of Men that are

for a long time was, as all allow,

difficult to find Perſons whoſe Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters

Nor indeed was there ever any Man per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect;
At ſuch a Seaſon therefore, Men

               <p>If the Nobility and Gentry retain their

<pb n="254" facs="tcp:93970:147"/>
as we have now upon the Throne, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem'd
by the whole World, and Head
of the Proteſtant Intereſt, ſhould at any

               <p>Particular Men do often miſcarry in
the World, notwithſtanding that in their
whole Tranſactions they give continu'd
Proofs of a moſt perfect Conduct, They
ſhall not be the Richer for their Thrift,
nor better eſteem'd for their Integrity:
Their Induſtry ſhall avail 'em nothing:
Their Courage ſhall never bring 'em Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory,
and their wiſeſt Councils ſhall have
no Succeſs. Others in the mean time e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
Way deficient, of no Deſert, and
meerly by the help of Fortune, ſhall ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
in all they undertake. But tho ſhe
may be ſaid to govern thus in ſingle E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents,
and here and there to influence in
the Actions of Private Perſons, Great
Monarchies and Commonwealths do not
depend upon Her. Politick Inſtitutions, pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
order'd in the beginning, and
keeping on in a Steady Courſe of Wiſdom
and Virtue, are out of her Power and
Rule, and can never fail to proſper; And
when Diſaſters happen to a State, 'tis
ſeldom the work of Chance, but rather the
effect of ſome Miſgovernment.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="256" facs="tcp:93970:148"/>
For in former Reigns we have ſeen,
that when the Kings Revenue was not
well Managed it proceeded from this,
that the Employments relating to it were
not the Rewards of Skill, but the Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
of another Merit, and that want of
knowledge in the Managers was wink'd at
while they were giving Money in another
Place. Heretofore If Men betrayed their
Truſt and ſold the People, it was becauſe
they were largely invited to it. In for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
times, when the Nations Trade im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair'd
and went backward, the ſecret
Cauſe was that the Miniſters were ſervilely
to Promote the Intereſt of ſome other
Country. And in the preceeding Reigns,
if the Kings Treaſure was wildly diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pated,
and if exorbitant Grants were
made, it came from this, that the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
could refuſe no Body, having a great
deal to ask for Themſelves, and that they
were not to put Rubs in the Way of
others, that they might more ſmoothly
carry on their own Pretenſions. Theſe
Inſtances are only given, not but that by
many others we could ſupport this Poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
That when the Public Treaſure is
waſted, when a Nation runs into im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe
Debts, when the Land of the
Crown is granted all away, when its Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues
are ill managed, and when the
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:93970:148"/>
People are Corrupted, we are not altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to blame Fortune, the Times or
Accidents of the War, but rather to attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
a great Share of theſe Evils to ſome
Error in the Subordinate Parts of the
Adminiſtration.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Tiberius</hi> in a Letter to the Senate has

his Epiſtle is to ſhow how difficult it was
for him to correct Vices, with which the
Principal Men of <hi>Rome</hi> were tainted, and
that by the Attempt he might draw Envy

might have reaſon to entertain ſuch a
Fear, the whole Legiſlative Power of
a Country need never lye under Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions
of the like nature. This Strength
can deal with the Ambition, Avarice,
Corruption and Rapine of the Great ones:
The Legiſlative Authority can correct
Men of Arbitrary Principles, and pull
down the topping Pride of Inſolent and
undertaking Miniſters, who are by no
means equal to their Buſineſs, and whoſe
Heads are Giddy, and turn round in the
Eminence, on which Fortune, Flattery,
and their other Vices, not their Merit,
has plac'd them.</p>

And if our Affairs here ſhould ever

               <p>While that Place contains Men of Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
and Public Spirit, Matters cannot
long proceed amiſs. Whoever therefore
undertakes that Truſt, ſhould continually
have before their<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Eyes how much the

Virtues. But above all things, they
ſhould have diſintereſted and ſelf-deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Minds.</p>
               <p>It can hardly be conceiv'd, but by thoſe
who have ſeen it, what Reverence is
paid, even by his Enemies, to a Man of
ſteady Principles, the Tenor of whoſe
Words and Actions are always the ſame;
who is neither to be bought nor fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
He is admir'd and follow'd, all he
ſays has its due weight, his honeſt Hoary
Head is dear to all Mankind. Whereas
the Whiffling Prolers after Places, and
little buſie Intreaguers, are contemptible
to the very Men, of whom they are the
wretched Inſtruments. And let the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious
think what they pleaſe, that Man
has moſt real Power in this Country, who
is believ'd to be of the moſt unſhaken In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity
towards the Public, and He who
has ſuch a Character enjoys more true
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:93970:149"/>
Greatneſs than all the vain Pomp and
Honors a Court can give.</p>
               <p>The Employments of <hi>England</hi> are yet
but few, and their Profits but Inconſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
to what they are in ſeveral Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
however ſmall as they ſeem to be,
'tis to be fear'd that ſome time or other
they will be made the Engins wherewith
bad Men will endeavour to ſubvert this

               <p>'Tis true, at preſent we are out of
ſuch a Danger, but if in future times we
ſhould change to ſee all Employments re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd
for Men in one certain Station, if
the Road to Preferment ſhould lye but
through one Place and Paſſage; when
this happens we ſhall have Cauſe to be
alarm'd, and to look about us.</p>
               <p>They who feel within themſelves A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities
to ſerve the Public, are by no
means blameable in deſiring to be upon
the Stage of Buſineſs. On the contrary,

Good Men ſhould rather ſtrive to be in

Hands. A Wiſe Man can eaſily diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
whither the Miniſters are ſuch, that
he may with Honour and Safety mix in
Councils with them. If the Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
be ſound and right, or if it has but
a Face looking that way, 'tis a proper
Seaſon for Men of Probity, Skill, and
Virtue, to produce their Talents, and to
puſh themſelves forward, in order more
fully to mend Things. And at ſuch a
time They ſhould be ready to aſſiſt the
State with their true Senſe and right Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding;
nor ſhould they lazily ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
the Perfections of their Minds to be
uſeleſs and unactive. And if among thoſe
there be any very Eminent, Strong in
Friends, vers'd in Affairs of State, of a
deep Reach and Foreſight, Who have E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loquence
to ſway Aſſemblies, and Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
to reſiſt and overcome Popular Fury,
Such ought not to deſpair of the Public,
but aſſiſt with their Wiſdom to redeem a
People from their weak Hands, who ſhall
get into Power by meer Chance, when
the Nation perhaps has been in a high
Ferment, as in Boyling Liquors the Scum

Reverence paid to thoſe who have a very
great Genius, that when they offer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to ſerve the Commonwealth, the
weight of the People will bear down all
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:93970:150"/>
the Upſtart Pretenders, and force 'em to
give way, and make Room for Merit ſo
Superiour.</p>
               <p>But if it ſhould ever happen that the
Adminiſtration ſhould be intirely bad and
wrong, then ought Good Men to have
no Share nor hand in it, They ſhould
withdraw from any Participation in the
Negligence or Guilt; They ſhould quit
what They cannot honourably hold;
They ſhould concern themſelves no more
in Buſineſs, leaving ſuch Miniſters to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern
by themſelves, who will not govern
well, and be contented to ſerve their
Country by defending Liberty in <hi>one Poſt</hi>

not make ſo ill a Uſe of that Affection
the People may bear 'em, and of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
they may have in the Nation, as
to be a ſhelter for the Crimes or Folly of
Others; Nor ſhould they as it were lend

to undermine the Conſtitution.</p>
               <p>If the Times are good, Silent Merit
will be ſought after; but if they are bad
ill Men will be lifted up to the Offices and

faſt, ready to ſplit at the next coming of
the Waves, when Ignorant Men are quite
bewilder'd in their Errors, when the
whole People See and Feel the Effect of
ill Government, when the Prince grows
aſham'd of thoſe whom His Subjects hate
and fear, when the Commonwealth can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
emerge out of its Debts and Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
withour Help from Abler Hands,
then is the true time for the beſt Men to
offer themſelves to the ſervice of their
Country. At ſuch a Seaſon Honeſty will
not ſtand alone, weak, defenceleſs, and
out of Countenance at the ſight of Proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perous
Vice. Nor can Courts be ever
Safe for Honeſt Men, till the Circumſtance
and Neceſſity of the times bring thither
a Party ſtrong enough to maintain itſelf
againſt thoſe who are grown great by
wicked Arts.</p>
               <p>If <hi>Engliſh</hi> Men will be continent in this
ſingle Point, all muſt of Courſe go well;
If they who have Noble Commands in
the Country will ſcorn meanly to depend
in Town; If they who have brave Seats
of their own will deſpiſe the crowded
Antichambers of the Great Ones here; If
they who have plentiful Eſtates, will
ſlight a troubleſome and precarious Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment,
They are more happy than
a Court can make them: If our Nobility
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:93970:152"/>
and Gentry would conſider how miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
the Noble-Men of <hi>France</hi> are with all
their Mighty Places, they would at no
time hereafter deſire to wear the Livery
of Bondage. And if they are truly ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon'd
with theſe Notions, That their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties
are above all Price, and (as
Sir <hi>Benjamin Rudiard</hi> was wont to ſay)
<hi>That there is nothing worth being a Knave,</hi>
the Head muſt be very Skilful, and the
Heart very Bold, that will undertake to
invade our Fundamental Rights.</p>
               <p>'Tis true, what has been here advanc'd
and what ſhall be ſaid anon, may ſeem
needleſs at preſent, when all things are
preſum'd to go well, but theſe Notions
may be of Uſe to After Ages.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Duty which Private Perſons owe to
the Public,</hi> lies in a very narrow Compaſs,
and when that is thoroughly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd,
a Country ſeldome fails to
ſee <hi>a ſteady Courſe of Wiſdom and Honeſty
in ſuch as are truſted with the Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
This Duty may chiefly conſiſt in
the following particulars.</p>
               <p>1ſt, That ſuch as repreſent the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
be Uncorrupt, Unbiaſs'd, and Diſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſted.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="265" facs="tcp:93970:152"/>
2ly, That they diligently attend the
Nation's Service.</p>
               <p>3ly, That they carefully watch any
Innovation or Incroachments upon the
Conſtitution.</p>
               <p>4ly, That they make Proviſion againſt
future Evils,</p>
               <p>5ly, That they<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> look narrowly into the
Income and Expence of the Kingdom, and
examin which way immenſe Debts have
been contracted, and how that Money has
been diſpoſed of which the Nation has
already granted.</p>
               <p>6ly, That They hold a ſtrong Hand
over the Men of Buſineſs, calling thoſe
to an Accompt, who, either through Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
or upon ſome wicked Deſign, purſue
deſtructive Meaſures.</p>
               <p>1ſt, <hi>That ſuch as repreſent the People be
uncorrupt, unbyaſs'd, and Diſintereſted.</hi>
This Point we have handled ſufficiently
in the Series of this Diſcourſe. And to
what has been already ſaid upon that ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
we ſhall now only add, That <hi>Rome</hi>
was once free, That <hi>France</hi> heretofore
had the three Eſtates, which were the
Guardians of its Liberty; That <hi>Spain</hi>
had formerly many Rights and Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges,
of which nothing now but the
Shadow remains: That <hi>Denmark</hi> and
<hi>Sweden</hi> had once Conſtitutious ſomething
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:93970:153"/>
like that of <hi>England;</hi> and that all theſe
Countries have been inſlav'd by their own
Corruptions.</p>
               <p>2ly, <hi>That They diligently attend the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
Service.</hi> For otherwiſe They do
not diſcharge the Truſt to which They
are choſen. It has been formerly a Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of great Wonder, that Gentlemen
ſhould even waſte their Fortunes to be
elected, and yet afterwards never mind
that Station which they ſeem'd before ſo
vehemently to covet. <hi>Cato</hi> had many
Virtues too big for Practice, but he may
be eaſily imitated in one good Quality he
had, of never failing to be preſent in the
Senate. Such ſhould give way to Others,
and make Room for Men of more Lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
who cannot afford to employ all
their Time in the Service of their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.
But above all others, they are to
blame who can be drawn from their Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
by Luxury, Lazyneſs, and Pleaſures.
Liberty can be hardly wounded in a full
Houſe, the Attempts made upon it in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Reigns were made when ſuch as had
no Dependance upon the Court were
abſent about their Country Buſineſs. The
ill Miniſters of thoſe days took that Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
To promote Taxes, which
would never paſs in a full Aſſembly,
To paſs dangerous Laws, To ſet afoot
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:93970:153"/>
new invented Corporations, which may
be fatal in their Conſequences, and To
form Projects either deſtructive to the
Nation in General, or Ruinous to particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Men. All the ill things ever done
have been compaſs'd when the Negligence
of ſome had made one ſide Strong and
the other Weak.</p>
               <p>And if in After Ages any of the Men
of Buſineſs ſhould be ſo wicked as to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
by the ſame Councils, and to go by
the like Meaſures, they will promote their
dark Deſigns in ſome ſuch Juncture, when
the beſt Patriots ſhall be gone away quite
tir'd out by Seſſions artificially prolong'd.</p>
               <p>But it is the Duty of all who love <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi>
to defeat by unweary'd patience
ſuch a Conſpiracy againſt the People;
And to obviate ſuch a Miſchief, if the
ordinary Rules cannot do it, extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Laws may be thought on to oblige
the Members to that Attendance which
they owe their Country.</p>
               <p>He who does not attend, injures the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough
for which he ſerves; for it may ſo
happen, that in his Abſence a thing may
paſs to their Ruin who have ſent him, and
which his preſence might have prevented;
His Electors therefore ſeem to have ſuch a
Right to his Service as in reaſon no Others
ought to diſpence with, without their
Conſent.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="268" facs="tcp:93970:154"/>
Deſerting in this Manner the Public is
a growing Evil, upon which account it
ought to have a timely Remedy. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
it might not be amiſs if a Bill were
brought in to make it highly Penal for
any Member to be abſent from the Houſe
above fourteen days, without expreſs
leave firſt had under the Seal of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough
for which he ſerves.</p>
               <p>A great many Miſchiefs both Publick
and Private would be prevented, if ſuch
as repreſent their Country would be ſtrict
in this Duty of attending.</p>
               <p>3dly, <hi>That they carefully watch an
Innovation or Incroachments upon they
Conſtitution.</hi> There is nothing lulls a
People more aſleep than the Reign
of a good Prince, reverenc'd for his Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
fear'd for his high Courage, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lov'd
for his Lenity, and admir'd for a
Number of other Virtues; whereas under
a bad Reign the Subjects are Jealous and
vigilant, tho often to little Purpoſe.
However, 'tis agreed on by all Writers,
that the Mild Rule of <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted
more to confirm the Slavery of
<hi>Rome,</hi> than all the Severity and Cuning
of <hi>Tiberius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The beſt Times likewiſe produce the
worſt Preſidents; for in good times the
People let many Things ſlip, being then
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:93970:154"/>
at their Eaſe, not ſuſpicious, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
not watchful over the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
but where this Supine Temper
prevails, mixt Governments decline im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
into Abſolute Power. The
frequent Conteſts that were of old be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Senate and People of <hi>Rome</hi>
without doubt preſerv'd their Freedom;
for where all are of one Mind, ill Uſe
may be made of that Unanimity, by
ſome Eloquent, Subtle, and Ambitious
Man, who may turn and rule it as he
pleaſes. Therefore to preſerve Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
that have a mixture in 'em of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular
Government, 'tis neceſſary there
ſhould be always ſome ſmall Diviſion,
juſt enough to keep the Minds of Men
awake, that they may obſerve what Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages
one part of the State gets over
the other.</p>
               <p>Bad Kings provoke enow to look into
their Actions, but when the People have
a good Prince, they give a favourable In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation
to all he does.</p>
               <p>And the beſt Man that ever Reign'd
may be ill ſerv'd.<note place="margin">Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrance of Lords and Commons, <hi>May</hi> 19. 1642.</note> It is a Maxim of our
Law, <hi>That the King can do no wrong, but
if any ill be committed in Matters of State,
the Council; if in Matters of Juſtice, the
Judges muſt anſwer for it.</hi> But though
the Laws exempt our Kings from Blame,
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:93970:155"/>
They are not freed from the bad Effects
of ill Conduct in their Miniſters.</p>
               <p>He therefore who repreſents his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
cannot do the Nation nor his Prince
better Service, than to ſee that thoſe who
ſit at Helm, do not run the Ship upon
dangerous Rocks. Abſolute Dominion is
a Bait with which the greateſt Minds
may be tempted; for they whoſe Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
is unlimited, may deſire that their
Power ſhould be ſo too. But no one
Man ought to think of being Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
unleſs he could be Omniſcient and
Omnipreſent. Beſides, though Princes
may deſire great Power, that they may
be able to do great Good, ſuch as ſerve
'em rarely proceed upon this Principle.
They often deſire their Maſters ſhould
be Arbitrary, in order to their own Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punity,
and to build a large fortune for
themſelves, for which reaſon they ſhould
be watch'd in all their Windings, and
follow'd in all their dark and ſubtle
Mazes.</p>
               <p>It ſeldom happens that the Liberties
of a Country are Invaded all at once,
The Steps of Power are leiſurely and
ſlow, Miniſters who have it in their
Thoughts to change the Nature of
a Government, go to work by Degrees.
At firſt they make uſe of the moſt Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:93970:155"/>
Hands they can poſſibly procure,
ordering it ſo, that the People may not
perceive who 'tis that puts their Fetters
on, but theſe Popular Men they ſhove
out at the firſt convenient Seaſon, that
all may be of a Piece. Their next Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
is to corrupt ſuch Perſons as have
the cleareſt Fame, whom they diſcard
when ſufficiently tainted, and this they
do that the People may think all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
alike, which naturally drives 'em to
follow thoſe only who are in Power, and
who can do 'em good. Afterwards they
get from the Nation all the Money they
can, the Collecting of which erects new
Employments, and creates them a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of Dependants, who, in one certain
place, are their chief Strength and beſt
Support: By the diſtribution of theſe
Summs, They likewiſe make more Friends.
But being never out of fear of accounting
for all at laſt, their Principal Aim is to
procure their Maſter ſuch a ſtanding Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue,
as may make him ſubſiſt without the
People's Help. If they find this impoſſible,
or difficult, then by Accuſations, by Exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitant
Proceedings without any Preſident,
and by harraſſing Private Perſons, either
in their Fame or Fortune, they endeavour
to make all the different Ranks of the
People out of love with their ancient
Conſtitution.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="272" facs="tcp:93970:156"/>
But when they have done all this,<note place="margin">Tacit L. 2. Hiſt.</note>
They will not yet think themſelves
quite out of danger. <hi>Senatus &amp; Popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus
nunquam obſcura Nomina, etſi Aliquan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do
obumbrentur.</hi> They will ſtill lie under
Apprehenſions of being reach'd at laſt
by the Guardians of Liberty. Therefore
to damp all Thoughts of Freedom, To
influence the better Sort, and To awe the
Vulgar, their laſt work is to procure a
Standing Army.</p>
               <p>By Manifeſt Original Contract, an
Arm'd Force cannot be rais'd nor kept
within this Kingdom, without Conſent
of Parliament, ſo that if hereafter we
ſhould be ever inſlav'd that way it is our
own proper Fault.</p>
               <p>Where Armies are Powerful, there
grows a Neceſſity upon Princes, rather to
pleaſe them than the People. And yet
no Mercenaries are ſufficient to help a
Prince againſt a Powerful Foreign Force,
if the Subjects are diſoblig'd at home.
<hi>Machiavel</hi> ſays, <hi>That a Prince who founds
the Duration of his Government upon Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenary
Troops ſhall never be firm nor ſecure.</hi>

dangerous,<note place="margin">Ch. 13.</note> becauſe <hi>they are always unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous,

If hereafter any Miniſters ſhould be ſo
wicked, to attempt the Subverſion of our
Fundamental Rights, we have here ſhown
ſome of the Steps, which they will probably
make, to compaſs their Deſigns. It there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
imports all good Men, to watch their
firſt Invaſions and Incroachments, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
to intercept 'em in their Courſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly, That they make Proviſion againſt
future Evils.</hi> The Virtues requiſite for
ſuch as will handle matters of Government,
have their Foundation in Wiſdom and
Courage. He, whoſe Endowments of the
Mind, are not ſufficient to foreſee a long
while before what may be the Event of a
Council, cannot conſult ſafely for his Prince;
and he who at every turn is afraid of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular
Anger, ſhall never give any ſound
Advice.</p>
               <p>Virtue and Wiſdom, in ſome Senſe, are
Terms Synonimous, and different Words,
ſignifying the ſame thing; for no Man can
be Virtuous with any Effect conducive to
the Publick Good, without a rich Talent
of the Mind, and ſtrong Wiſdom; nor can
a Man be truly Wiſe, without ſuch Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Virtue, as warmly embraces the Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
Honour and Intereſt of his Country.
And when a Genius of this kind appears
in any Nation, he has a Natural Right to the
Offices and Dignities of the State: But if e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:93970:157"/>
Courts ſhall happen to be deprav'd, they
will like quite another ſort of Men: Want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
true Wiſdom, they muſt ſet up ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in the Room of it; that is to ſay, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary
Shifts, and ſhort Remedies; raw
and unskillful Medlers in Buſineſs, are their
Darlings, that will venture at all, and yet
know nothing; upon which Principle they
make open War with Deſert of any kind,
and reckon it a great Conqueſt, when they
can get rid of a wary and knowing Stateſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.</p>
               <p>They count it ſupream Wiſdom to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
any ſingle Neceſſity, never regarding
whether the manner of doing it be Safe, Juſt,
or Honourable. They not only truſt Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
(as all Men ſhould do) but are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
to reſt wholly upon it; believing
Foreſight, and Thoughts of the Future, to
bring more Anxiety than Profit. They are
Wiſe, as ſome Men ſubſiſt from Hand to
Mouth; they think it ſufficient to live to
Day, and to make Proviſion for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
Moment. All this perhaps may be
good Philoſophy in Private Caſes; but for
the whole Body of a State to go by ſuch
Rules, muſt needs be very dangerous.</p>

thoſe who do not follow this Method, will fall
into great Confuſions, which it will be very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult

down,<hi> That it is a common thing among weak
Men, to drive off time, and to chuſe the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving
their Eaſe for a Month, rather than
to deprive themſelves of it for a while, to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void
the Trouble of many Years; which they
do not conſider, becauſe they ſee only what is

We have here cited the Authorities of
two very able Men, both in the Theory

dangerous their Meaſures are, who conſult
nothing but their preſent Eaſe, who love
Palliating Remedies, and who are for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving

               <p>If we ſhould ever fall into ſuch Hands,

Heats and Animoſities at Home,
and putting Impediments in the way of any
Power that grows too faſt, are ſo many
Seeds which Great and Able States-men,
are always Sowing, without a Proſpect to

Whereas, ſuch as proceed upon that narrow

The laſt Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> had many
Deſigns to put the Affairs of his Eſtate in
Order; and to this End he conſulted ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
ſorts of Men: His wiſe and true Friends
laid before him, That no ways would be
ſo effectual, as to look into his Accompts,
to employ honeſt Stewards, and to live
within Compaſs. But there was another Sett
of People, in whom he more delighted,
who made him believe they would put his
Buſineſs into ſuch a Poſture, that no Negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence,
nor no Profuſion ſhould do him any
hurt. In ſhort, they told him directly,
That they would procure for him the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers

indeed it would prove a kind of Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers
Stone, if they can ſo concert matters, as
to obtain all the ſupplies they ſhall inſiſt on)
they will perſwade Him they can maintain
His Crown and Dignity out of a Mine of
new Projects, never to be exhauſted, and
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:93970:159"/>
upon this View they will adviſe Him, firſt,
to give <hi>them</hi> very large Sums to buy Lim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becks,
Crucibles, and Charcoal; for Utenſils
muſt be had, and Workmen muſt be paid;
they will promote the making Exorbitant
Grants, and giving away the Crown Lands
upon this Notion, That 'tis ſowing a little
to reap much. They will conceal pernici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Penſions under the dark Veil of <hi>Secret
Service.</hi> An Article that hides all. But <hi>the
Eſtimates of the Charge of the War</hi> will be
the beſt ſhelter they can poſſibly have for
their Profuſions of any kind, where they
may incert <hi>Items</hi> never to be diſprov'd, and
never to be underſtood. Finding how much
it turns to their own Account to have an
Ample Revenue to range in, they will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade
their Prince to ask all Things, and to
ſpare nothing: And if ſuch Bad Men as
have been here deſcrib'd ſhould ever come
to be truſted, they will make the Body Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litick
faint and look pale with continual O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening
of its Veins; they will leave the
Crown bare, the Exchequer empty, and all
the Revenues Anticipated; they will di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs
the Gentry, and begger the Common
People; and having thus inrich'd themſelves,
and improveriſh'd all other Degrees of Men,
they will reduce the Nation to be naked and
defenceleſs, hardly able to ſupport it ſelf at
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:93970:160"/>
home, much leſs in a Condition to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go
another Foreign War.</p>
               <p>If at any time hereafter, ſuch Men as have
been here painted out, ſhould be ſuffer'd
to entangle our Matters, to diſſipate our
Treaſure, and to waſte the Commonwealth,
where will be the Money, the Fleet, and
Arms, that may be neceſſary, in caſe the
French ſhould ever break the Peace, and
attempt to poſſeſs themſelves of <hi>Spain,</hi> and
the <hi>Weſt-Indies?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If by the Giddy, or rather frantick Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
of Beardleſs Politicians, lifted perhaps
up from the meaneſt Obſcurity, and ſet in
a manner to hold the Reins, our Affairs
ſhould hereafter be brought ſo low, (which
God forbid) as that we muſt ſit ſtill, while
thoſe Dominions fall into a Power already
but too Dreadful, how can Univerſal Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy
be avoided? And if <hi>Spain</hi> ſhould
happen to be thus loſt, we are not only
hurt in a point of Empire, the moſt Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant
of all, but the whole Trade of
<hi>England</hi> will be cut up by the very Roots.</p>
               <p>It may be laid down for a certain Truth,
that no Man of a great Fortune, was ever
undone in a few Years, but he was Cheat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of much more, than he was able to Spend:
And this is yet more true, if the Man had
Parts, and a good Uunderſtanding. Private
Men are Ruin'd, when thoſe about 'em are
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:93970:160"/>
Unfaithful, and are to Profit by their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction;
and if they have no truſty Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant,
that will put them in Mind of their
Condition.</p>
               <p>The ſame holds in the Affairs of a whole
Nation. When a Public, that was once
clear and eaſy, is overwhelm'd with Debts;
when this happens among a People that
have been always willing to give, and in
a Miniſtry that has never been backward
to ask, when all Occaſions have been ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd
to their full demand, when the Prince
is wiſe, and without any Expenſive Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures;
when ſuch a Countrey does labour
under Difficulties almoſt inſuperable, and
when in ſome future Reign all this ſhall be
our Caſe, Mankind will entertain an Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
that the Adminiſtration is not right;
the World will be inclin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d to think, that
ſuch as ſhall then govern in the Revenue
want either Fidelity or Skill; it will be
thought that they have not at any time laid
before their Maſter a true State of his Affairs;
it will be believ'd that they have never con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triv'd
his Expences with Care and Wiſdom,
and that they have not endeavour'd by grave
and wholſome Councils to moderate his
Bounties.</p>
               <p>The Liberality of a Prince, the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
we can imagin, will yet oblige but
a very few; and to give it a conſtant Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply,
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:93970:161"/>
vaſt Numbers muſt be harraſs'd. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides,
among the Vulgar, Frugality in a
Court does in ſome Meaſure commute for
high Taxes. Liberality is Noble in rich
and quiet Times, but it will hardly be thought
juſt, when what is given is to be in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
the laſt drop of Blood in the Subjects
Veins. Not to value their Treaſure has been
always the Fault of Great and Heroick minds,
of which many had been ruin'd every Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
but that they had grave and honeſt
Miniſters ready to keep 'em within Bounds
by wholſom Advices, rugged Truths, and
ſevere Virtue. And ſo the Duke of <hi>Sully</hi>
proceeded with his Maſter <hi>Harry</hi> the 4<hi>th.</hi>
When a Prince is in his Nature too Boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful,
it is a Duty incumbent upon ſuch as
ſerve Him, with all Humility to beg, That
in his high Wiſdom he would conſider how
hardly that is gather'd, which they ſhall
ſee ſo lightly given: They ought rather to
quit their Poſts, than to ſign or fix the
Seal to immoderate Gifts. But thoſe Hands
muſt be very clean themſelves, which are
held up to Kings with humble Prayers, that
they would have Compaſſion on their Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
               <p>'Tis true, War is a devouring Monſter,
and to feed it will very much diſorder the
Revenues of a Country: And yet we ſee
<hi>France</hi> has been able for Nine Years to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:93970:161"/>
all the Strongeſt Part of <hi>Europe,</hi> to
have all the while Land Armies, conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of above three hundred Thouſand Men,
and to maintain a Fleet as numerous, and
more expenſive than that of <hi>England:</hi> And
after all this, they have been in a Condition
to make larger Expences of all kinds (as is
ſaid) than in any two Years during the
War; and wee ſee 'em now in a Poſture to
meditate higher Deſigns than ever. That
they did bear up ſo long againſt the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federate
Strength, that they have been able
Annually to expend ſuch an Immenſe Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
for upward now of ten Years, and that
they are not at preſent quite exhauſted and
impoveriſh'd, muſt without doubt proceed
from the good Conduct of thoſe to whom
the Management of their Affairs has been
intruſted. No Man is indur'd under that
Monarchy to perform the Functions and Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices
of the State in an ignorant and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
manner. The Minſters there are more
frugal for their Maſter than in their own
Concerns; they do not make too much
haſt to be Rich; they are contented that a
Great Fortune ſhould be the Recompence
of many Services, and of long Merit. They
have not let the Crown Lands of <hi>France</hi>
be as it were a Derelict, <hi>Et primi Occupantis:</hi>
We do not obſerve it has been ſo order'd
in that Kingdom, that both the Body of
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:93970:162"/>
the People and the Public too are Poor at
one and the ſame Inſtant; their Miniſters
have not ſuffer'd the Commonwealth to
be conſum'd by Uſurious Contracts with the
Common Lenders; and by their Care and
Wiſdom they have obtain'd ſuch Credit,
even under a Deſpotick Power, that they
have not been forc'd all along to pay above
7 <hi>per Cent.</hi> Intereſt for Money lent the King;
whereas 40 <hi>per Cent.</hi> has been paid for migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
Sums in one Free Government: ſo that
upon the whole Matter, 'tis evident enough,
that <hi>this Devouring Monſter War is to be fed</hi>
where the Men of Buſineſs are Honeſt,
Foreſeeing and Frugal for the State.</p>
               <p>Mix'd Governments, among many other
Excellencies, have this Advantage, that a
good Adminiſtration may be obtain'd by
any one part of the Conſtitution, that will
ſet it ſelf ſtrongly to ſo good a Work;
Kings can at all times ſet things right, if
the Buſineſs of their Wars do not compel
'em to be often Abſent. Either of the Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
when they have ſet themſelves to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
into, and correct Diſorders, have been
terrible to the moſt Bold, Subtile, and moſt
Powerful Stateſmen, that ever went about
to undo a People, or to miſlead a Prince.</p>
               <p>If in any future Reign, the Treaſure of
this Kingdom ſhould be miſ-manag'd, and
profuſely waſted; and if Debts, hardly to
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:93970:162"/>
be waded through, ſhould be contracted;
the Repreſentatives of the People may, by
looking ſtrictly into all theſe Matters, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
immediately leſſen the publick Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
at leaſt they may put ſome Stop to
the farther Progreſs of the Miſchief.</p>
               <p>In ſuch a Juncture, good Men will think
it their Duty, to ſee whether this Debt is
not to be leſſen'd, by reviewing former Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compts;
they will examine, whether the
Sums already granted were not ſufficient
to pay off all the Forces we have had at
Land and Sea: They will inquire from
whence ſuch a high Article of Arrears pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds:
They will ſee how ſo many Fonds
come to be Deficient, and whether ſuch De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiencies
have not been occaſion'd by ſome
ill Conduct in thoſe, who have manag'd
the reſpective Branches: They will inform
themſelves, which way the many Millions
are gone, which the People have paid:
They will deſire to know, what Neceſſities
could compel the Men of Buſineſs to give
ſuch large <hi>Premiums,</hi> and high Intereſt; and
whether the Promoters of a Council ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious,
did not lend their own Money;
and whether they have not been Parties
deeply concern'd themſelves in all uſurious
Contracts: They will inquire upon what
Conſideration, and for what Services, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate
Grants of Lands and Money have
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:93970:163"/>
been made, and they will do it the more
ſtrictly; if, when ſuch Grants were paſs'd,
it ſhould happen that the Nation was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted,
and paid heavy Taxes.</p>
               <p>The Repreſentatives of the People can
look into all theſe things; and, no Doubt,
it is a Duty which they owe their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
that has truſted 'em with ſo unlimited
a diſpoſal of their Fortunes.</p>
               <p>To prevent Miſmanagement in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue
of this Kingdom, it ſeems neceſſary
that a Law ſhould be made, to put the Lords
of the Treaſury under ſuch an Oath, as the
Lord High Treaſurer of <hi>England</hi> takes; for
it appears an Abſurdity in our Government,
that the meaneſt Officer concern'd in the
King's Revenue, ſhould be ſworn to a true,
and faithful Diſcharge of his Truſt; and
that the Treaſury, who are truſted with
the whole, whoſe Authority is ſo boundleſs,
and who have it ſo much in their Power,
to hurt the Nation, ſhould be under no
Oath at all. Some Objections there are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
this; but he who conſiders 'em well,
will find 'em of no weight, and that thoſe
Neceſſities which have broken into, and
over-rul'd the Ancient Courſe of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chequer,
might have been avoided by Care
and Conduct.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="287" facs="tcp:93970:163"/>
If in future Times <hi>England</hi> ſhould have
any Grounds to doubt, that the Treaſure of
the Public has been Imbezzel'd; if prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
Fortunes, rais'd in ten Years by ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure
Men, who have had no Dealings but
with the Court, ſhould Miniſter Occaſion
of Suſpition; if Reſumptions ſhould be
thought fit, we mean in Caſes where Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
of no Merit have been inrich'd with
the Kingdom's Spoils; if it ſhould be
thought reaſonable to ſee whether any thing
is to be ſav'd in an immenſe Debt, out of the
unwarrantable Gains which the Lenders
have made; if it ſhould be judg'd expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
to inquire into any Male-Adminiſtration
in thoſe through whoſe Hands the Revenue
paſſes; if it ſhould be deem'd neceſſary
Thrift to look into all Penſions; if it ſhould
be thought reaſonable fairly and impartially
to ſtate the Accompt of ſo many Millions
given and expended, ſo great and difficult
a Work as a Strict Inquiry into all theſe
Matters will prove, cannot be enter'd upon,
and brought to a good Concluſion, but by
the united Wiſdom of the Nation.</p>
               <p>No other Power can face that Strong
League, which will be made between Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
Criminals, to ſave one another. Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Remedies prevail but little againſt ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born

our Affairs ſhould be ever in diſorder, the
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:93970:164"/>
Legiſlative Authority can bring the moſt
effectual Helps to ſet us right.</p>
               <p>And in ſuch a Caſe, peradventure, it may
be thought adviſable to promote a Bill, That
ſuch ſort of Abuſes as have been here deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed,
and all other Male-adminiſtration of the
like kind, may be inquir'd into by Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tees
of both Houſes, to ſit in the Interval
of Parliament, with all requiſite Powers,
without Salaries, and to be choſen by Ballot.
And ſuppoſing paſt Errors to be too big for
Correction, yet ſo Awfull an Authority, and
the fear that it will from time to time be
renew'd, may, for the future, be ſome Check
to the growing Corruptions of the Age.</p>
               <p>All the Premiſes conſider'd, we ſubmit
it to better Judgments, whether it is not the
Duty of ſuch as repreſent their Country,<hi> To
look narrowly into the Income and Expence
of the Kingdom, and to examin which way
immenſe Debts have been contracted, and how
that Money has been diſpos'd of, which the
Nation has already granted.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sixthly, That They ſhould hold a Strong
Hand over the Men of Buſineſs, calling thoſe
to an Account, who either through Folly, or
upon ſome wicked Deſign, purſue deſtructive
Meaſures. Helvidius Priſcus,</hi> after the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
of his Father-in-law <hi>Petus Thraſea</hi>
in the Philoſophy he made uſe of to fit
himſelf for the Service of his Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth,
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:93970:164"/>
follow'd the Opinion of the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ick,
who plac'd all Good and Evil in Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty
or Diſhoneſty, accounting the Gifts
of Fortune, ſuch as high Birth, Power and
Wealth, to be but things indifferent to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the conſtituting of Happineſs, which
they define to be internal only in the Mind.</p>
               <p>But tho' <hi>Ariſtides, Socrates, Phocion, Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licola,
Cinciunatus, Attilius Regulus,</hi> and
many others, have been great Men under a
conſtant and willing Poverty; yet, without
doubt, Nobility and Riches help good Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
on of their way, and ſet 'em forward:
He that is high Born, his Perfections may
be ſooner taken notice of, as ſtanding upon
an Eminence; and he that has Wealth need
not be troubled with Private and Dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick
Cares, and may devote all his Time
and Thoughts to the Service of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey.</p>

to invade the Conſtitution of a Free
People, takes this Courſe:<hi> To ſubvert all,
to turn every thing Topſie Turvie, and make
all things new. To alter the Magiſtracy, cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
new Titles, Eelct new Perſons, confer
new Authorities, advance the Poor, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poveriſh
the Rich. That what is ſaid of </hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,<hi>may be ſaid of him: He filled the Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry
with good Things, and the Rich he has
ſent empty away. Beſides, it is his Intereſt to
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:93970:165"/>
build new Cities, to ſhift the Inhabitants from
one place to another; in a Word, ſo to Toſs
and Tranſpoſe every thing, that there be no
Honour, Wealth, nor Preferment in the whole
Province, but what is ownable to him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Some of theſe Courſes were taken by <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>
the 3<hi>d.</hi> in <hi>France;</hi> but his chief aim was
to introduce new Perſons into ſuch Offices
and Dignities of the State, as were fill'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
with the Nobility and Princes of the
Blood. He rais'd out of the Duſt obſcure
Perſons, who might owe to him only their
Wealth and Honor, and who might look
upon him as their ſecond Creator: Theſe
paid him a blind Obedience; they never con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider'd
what was for the Publick Good,
what was Reaſonable, Safe, Expedient, Juſt,
or Honeſt, but in all things did as they were
commanded; with ſuch a Sett of Men this
dark Prince gave the firſt Mortal Wound to
the Liberties of <hi>France;</hi> He plac'd them ſo
high as to overlook the old Gentry, who
being weaken'd and depreſs'd, had neither
the Intereſt nor the Courage to preſerve
their Ancient Form of Government.</p>
               <p>He has been follow'd in theſe Steps by
all the French Kings his Succeſſors; ſo that
under that Monarchy, in every Reign ſince,
we have hardly ſeen any but the Creatures
meerly of the Prince's Favour, and quite
new Men upon the Stage of Buſineſs, and
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:93970:165"/>
ſuch have in a manner ingroſs'd all the
Employments of Profit, Truſt and Honor.</p>
               <p>We grant that in a well conſtituted Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
which is upon a right Foot in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
neither Wealth nor Titles, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but Virtue and Abilities, ſhould pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
a Man to the Honors and Employments
of his Country. But when the Times are
too corrupt to admit of ſuch Meaſures, the
Queſtion will be, Who with moſt ſafety are
to be rely'd on, they whoſe Fortunes are
made, or they who are to make their For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes?
They who have a Satiety of Titles,
or they whoſe Ambition may prompt 'em
to attempt any thing to advance Them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves?</p>
               <p>In all likelihood Countreys (whoſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prav'd

He who has a good Stake, will be afraid
to engage in deſperate Councils; he who
has a large Eſtate will not conſent to have
the Laws ſubverted, which are his firmeſt
Security; for where the Sword governs,
Lands at beſt are held but under a precarious
Title. They who are well Born will deſire
to preſerve that Conſtitution, of which
they and their Anceſtors have always been
a Part: Inſtead of Governing and making a

with a deſign to build a Family, and make
a Fortune; who are to get all, and can loſe
nothing, who are chiefly recommended by
their Boldneſs to Undertake, and readineſs
to Comply, whom no Councils fright, and
whom no Meaſures ſhock; ſuch Men are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
the proper Inſtruments for introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing

               <p>Whoever looks over our Hiſtories, will

Moſt of our former Princes having had
Deſigns of Abſolute Domimion, and find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that the Men of Fortune and Figure
would rather obſtruct, than promote their
Intentions, thought it more conducing to
their Ends to be ſerv'd by another ſort of
People, and did therefore bring into the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement
of their Affairs all along a Sett of
Miniſters, Weak, Ambitious, Light, Deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
Raſh, Unskilfull in the Arts of wiſe
Adminiſtration, and vers'd in nothing but
Craft and Tricks; but at the Head of theſe
they had always ſome one that was to be the
Forlorn Hope, and who would venture to
go greater Lengths than any of his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions:
And for this Poſt they generally
choſe a Puſhing Man of a Bold Spirit, a
ready Wit, a Fluent Tongue, obſcure and
low in the World, and ſuch a One whom
Fortune could hardly leave in a worſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
than ſhe found him. Nor was it
difficult to find Perſons of this Character,
who would hazzard their Heads, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs
Power, Wealth, and Greatneſs. And
tho' they could not arrive at Unlimitted
Monarchy, the Philoſophers Stone, our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Stateſmen have ſo much hunted after,
yet in the Search of it they found ſeveral
other good Things; we mean, good for
themſelves, that is to ſay, Titles and Great
Eſtates. 'Tis true, many of 'em have been
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:93970:167"/>
interrupted in their Courſe, and the weight
of the People has born 'em down at laſt.
But a Man of a wretched Beginning, never
heard of before, when he ſees himſelf lift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
up high, ſeldom thinks of the Laws,
Impeachments, and the Ax. He hopes to
elude Juſtice; that the Power which ſet
him on, will bring him off; and that he
may be defended by his Numbers, and a
Corrupted Majority devoted to him; or as
his Predeceſſors have done, that he may
at laſt retire full of Wealth and Crimes, and
that his Guilt will be cover'd in the freſher
Offences of thoſe who are to Succeed him:
Or Men of this Stamp, when they have got
all they can, may think to be forgiven by
changing Sides; and that it will be time e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to become good Patriots, when they
are no longer ſuffer'd to hurt the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth;
for the Arms of the Public have

'Twould be endleſs to enumerate all the
Dangers that may befall a Free Government,
if it ſhould have at the Head of its Affairs
a Miniſter of a bold and Enterprizing Spirit,
who, from a low Degree, aſpires to the
higheſt Greatneſs, and whoſe Ambition is
not reſtrain'd by any Private or Publick
Conſiderations.</p>
               <p>If in ſome future Reigns it ſhould be our
Caſe to have ſuch a Man in a Station, and
with the Power of doing much Hurt, all
ſuch as deſire to preſerve their Civil Rights,

to ſtop him in his Career, and to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercept

                  <hi>There is one Rule infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible
to Princes in the Election of ſuch as are
to ſerve 'em. When you obſerve your Officer
more careful of himſelf than of you, and all
his Actions and Deſigns pointing at his own
Intereſt and Advantage, that Man will never

               <p>We ſhall beg the Reader's Pardon for
one ſhort Digreſſion in this Place,<note place="margin">Ibid. <hi>c.</hi> 22.</note> and it
is to take notice of another fine Remark of
the ſame Author, who ſays,<hi> The Actions of
a new Prince are liable to a ſtricter Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
than if he were Hereditary; and when
they are known to be Virtuous, gain more up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
People, and oblige them farther than An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity
of Blood, becauſe Men are more affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:93970:168"/>
with preſent than paſs'd things. </hi>But to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
to our Matter.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Spaniards</hi> were in a flouriſhing Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
in <hi>Richlieu</hi>'s time:<note place="margin">Teſtament Politique du Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal <hi>Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieu, p.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 3.</note> And in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of his Miniſtry the Affairs of <hi>France</hi>
were in great Diſorder: He wholly attributes
the Proſperity of <hi>Spain</hi> to this Principle
(running through all their Councils at that
time, and prevailing with all their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters)
of preferring the Publick Good to
Private Intereſt; and the contrary obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in <hi>France,</hi> he ſays, was the Cauſe of all
their Diſorders. So that we may juſtly
think the preſent Greatneſs of the <hi>French</hi>
has taken its Riſe from this Noble Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
having gotten, there, deeper Footing
now than it had heretofore.</p>
               <p>Miniſters, whoſe Chief Aim, in all they
do, is their own Greatneſs, can neither be
good for Prince nor People. And when
they conſult their Private Intereſt more than
the Public Good, 'tis, in many Inſtances,
apparent to all the World; as for Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> When they take no Care of their
Maſter's Revenue. For in all Countreys,
and in all Ages, bad Stateſmen have thriven
beſt under Princes plung'd in Debts and
Difficulties.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="297" facs="tcp:93970:168"/>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> When they have made a falſe
Step, and do not own it, and recede, but
rather call in the Prince's Authority, and all
his more immediate Dependants, to help
'em out, and to countenance their Errors,
'tis a Sign they have more regard to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
than to his Honor.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> When they enter upon new and
deſperate Councils, which if they ſucceed
well, will redound to their proper Glory;
and if they ſhould have a bad Event, may
hazzard his Ruin; 'tis a plain Mark that they
are ready to ſacrifice his Safety to their own
Vanity or Ambition.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> When they conceal from him
Truths which he ought to know; when
they do not acquaint him with the State
of his Affairs, nor with the true Condition
of the Nation; when they do not endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to moderate his Expences; and when
they do not quit, when ſound Councils
cannot prevail, 'tis an evident Proof, That
they prefer keeping up their Intereſt, as
they call it, and holding their Poſt and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments,
to all other Conſiderations what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> When they are ready to do any
thing, let it be never ſo hurtful to their
Maſter, provided it ſquare with the Intereſt
and Meaſures of the Party, of which they
are at the Head, and by whom they are
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:93970:169"/>
buoy'd up; 'Tis a Mark that they aim at,
being independant even of the Prince him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
and that they think to ſubſiſt more
by the Strength of their own Faction, than
by his Favour.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sixthly,</hi> When Man to Man, and <hi>ſingly,</hi>
they are willing to own any Errors, but ſay
at the ſame time, that they were againſt
this, and that, accuſing their Brethren of
the State for every Miſcarriage, 'tis a Sign
that provided they themſelves are well
thought on, they do not care what Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the People entertain of the whole Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verment.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Seventhly,</hi> When they are for propoſing
diſhonorable and unjuſt Shifts to raiſe Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
rather than to take the Pains of form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
before hand better Schemes for Ways
and Means, 'tis a Sign that they prefer
the Momentary Arts of recommending
themſelves to all Thoughts whatſoever, and
that they conſult more their own eaſe than
the Publick Good. 'Tis likewiſe an Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
that they are not of <hi>Richlieu</hi>'s mind,
who ſays,<note place="margin">Teſtament Politique, <hi>p.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 4.</note> 
                  <hi>That publick Adminiſtration takes
up the Thoughts of Judicious Miniſters, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
that the perpetual Meditations they are
oblig'd to make, to foreſee and prevent the Evils
that may happen, deprives them of all manner
of Reſt and Contentement, excepting that which
they receive in ſeeing many Sleep quietly, rely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:93970:169"/>
on their Watchings, and live happy by their
Miſery.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Eigthly,</hi> When contrary to the Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Land, they promote Councils
which tend to the keeping up an Arm'd
Force, 'tis a ſign, that not daring to truſt
the Laws, they would have their Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
maintain'd another way; that they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
ſuch an Impunity as the Sword has ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
fail'd to give bad Miniſters in other
Countries. 'Tis a Mark that their own
Safety is their principal Object, and that
they had rather the Nation ſhould be bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then'd
with Taxes, and have the Form of
Government alter'd, and that the Prince
ſhould loſe his Subjects Hearts, than ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
themſelves before a Free and angry
People.</p>
               <p>We have given ſome of the Marks,
which ſelfiſh and deſigning Stateſmen may
be known by hereafter. And if in future
times it ſhould be our Caſe, to ſee Perſons
of this Character upon the Stage of Buſineſs,
we muſt rowſe up the Vigour of our Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
Conſtitution, we muſt awaken all the
Laws, and direct 'em boldly to the Heads
of ſuch a dangerous ſort of Men.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Machiavel </hi>ſays,<note place="margin">Diſcourſes on <hi>Livy.</hi> lib. 2. C. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>That they who govern'd
the State of </hi>Florence,<hi> from Anno 1434, to
1494, were wont to ſay, That it was neceſſary
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:93970:170"/>
every five Years to review the State, for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
it would be very hard to maintain it:
They call'd reviewing the State, reducing the
People to the ſame Terror and Awe as they had
upon 'em of old, when every Man was pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd
according to his Crime, let his Quality
be what it would.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He lays down likewiſe,<hi> That Kingdoms
as well as Commonwealths, have often occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to be reduc'd to their firſt Principles:</hi>Which, he ſays,<hi> was done in </hi>France<hi> by the
Parliaments, who reviv'd the Ancient Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
as often as they oppos'd the King
in his Arreſts, and as often as they call'd
great Delinquents to account, whoſe Crimes, if
they are ſuffer'd to grow, cannot be reform'd
but with Diſorder, if not the Diſſolution of the
whole Government.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For want of purſuing ſome ſuch like
Courſes, the <hi>French</hi> have loſt their old Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution,
and are now under the abſolute
Sway of a ſingle Perſon; and that we in
<hi>England</hi> continue ſtill to be a free People,
is without doubt chiefly owing to that
Power, which our Anceſtors have from
time to time exerted, of impeaching ſuch
of the great Ones, as they ſaw entering up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Meaſures, which plainly tended to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce
unlimited Dominion.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="301" facs="tcp:93970:170"/>
We have been hitherto preſerv'd by pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
down ſuch Men, as were ſetting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
and their Maſter above the Laws;
and we ſhall tranſmit to Poſterity our Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
Rights untouch'd and untainted, if we
do not loſe our wonted Courage.</p>
               <p>If therefore, in any future Reign, it ſhould
be ſeen, that the Miniſters waſte the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom's
Treaſure, that they miſgovern or miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>apply
it, that they break into appropriated
Fonds; that they give Advices which invade
Property, and which, in their Conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
tend to diſaffect the People. And laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that to ſecure themſelves they promote
one Council, which muſt end in the ſubver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of all the Laws; if theſe things ſhould
come to appear, they who repreſent their
Country will not be afraid to attack theſe
bold and high Crimes with Complaints,
Addreſſes and Impeachments; for if this be
omitted, the Impunity ſuch Men have
found will engage ſo many new Offenders,
that at laſt, by their Number, they grow ſafe,
and above Correction; and when this hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens
(as it has appear'd in the inſtance of
<hi>France</hi>) the Liberties of a Country are
intirely loſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="302" facs="tcp:93970:171"/>
When Matters are become unquiet, by
ill Conduct, diſcerning Princes, like Wiſe
Men who have a Law-ſuit, deſire to piece
things up as ſoon as poſſible, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
the Bone of Diſſention; as ſeeing
full well, That Troubles make the common
People Inquiſitive, that Inquiry gives 'em
Knowledge; and that when they have
Knowledge, they are very hard to Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern.</p>
               <p>But ill Miniſters often think that the
beſt Courſe to ſave themſelves, is yet far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to embroil their Maſters buſineſs, not
conſidering, that the more things grow di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturb'd,
the greater Neceſſity there will be
of ſacrificing them to appeaſe the People's
Anger.</p>
               <p>Stateſmen ſhould take great Care how
they contract Publick Hatred: For both
Good and Bad Kings deſert 'em at laſt,
and with juſt Reaſon; for he who has
not Judgment, Conduct and Wiſdom e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to avoid being odious, deſerves
not to be protected by his Prince, to his
own Hurt and Danger.</p>
               <p>Is there any Inſtance of a Wiſe, Juſt,
and Good King (Reigning ſo long as
to have his Virtues known) who had
not the Hearts and Affection of his
Subjects? When Plots are form'd againſt
ſuch Princes, are they not preſently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated?
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:93970:171"/>
And does not all Mankind de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
the Conſpirators? And let ſome
Flatterers ſay what they will, the Vulgar
are not impatient of any Rule<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that is
tolerably fair and eaſie; at bottom they
love the Splendor of a Court, and are
fond of Regal Power; ſo that Kings,
who will but ſtoop the leaſt to be Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular,
are doated upon, and Idolis'd in
every Countrey.</p>
               <p>The ſame thing holds in relation to Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters,
if they are honeſt, if they have a
Superior Genius, if they do not make too
much haſt to be rich, if they are notoriouſly
ſeen to prefer the Common Welfare be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
their own Private Intereſt, if they are
Affable and Induſtrious in doing good Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
if by their Actions 'tis known that they
do not deſire to hold their Stations upon
any ignoble Terms, if they are not Haughty,
Arrogant, and Inſolent, they may Rule the
State without Clamors, they may grow
Grey in their Dignities and Offices, the beſt
Part of Mankind will be conſtantly of their
Side. And if they are at any time attack'd
by Private Malice upon ſome Diſobligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
or Diſappointment, their Enemies will
not be able to do 'em any hurt: Clouded
they may be for a while, but they will ſoon
ſhine out with freſher Luſtre. If by Inad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertency,
and through the Frailty of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:93970:172"/>
Nature, they have made falſe Steps,
and committed ſmall Faults, the General
Voice will be ready to excuſe 'em, and their
Perfections ſhall be put in the Ballances, and
outweigh their Errors.</p>
               <p>But here it may be objected, that <hi>Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieu,</hi>
who was undoubtedly one of the Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
Men that ever undertook the Guidance
of a State, and who had very near all the
good Qualities neceſſary for one to whom
the Reins of Empire are committed, did,
notwithſtanding, lie under continual Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſations,
Popular Anger, and Conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
againſt his Perſon. To which we an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,
That this Cardinal was a good Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter
for the <hi>French</hi> King, but not for
<hi>France.</hi> He had all along Deſigns to make
his Maſter Abſolute. Tis true, he endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd,
by his Sagacity, Care, and Deep
Foreſight, to make the <hi>French</hi> as great and
happy as a Country can poſſibly be under
an unlimitted Dominion: However, his
Foundation was not found at bottom, nor
honeſt to Humane kind: He was therefore,
from time to time, harras'd, interrupted and
perplex'd by the few good Patriots that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main'd,
who had ſtill an Eye towards their
ancient Conſtitution: Some indeed joyn'd
with theſe to oppoſe him, who did not act
upon ſo right a Principle.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="305" facs="tcp:93970:172"/>
But when the Miniſters in the Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
they take to promote their Maſter's
Greatneſs, conſider their Countries Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
when at one and the ſame time they
are Truſty and Impartial Servants to Prince
and Country both, when they duly Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>template
how unwiſe and wrong it is ever
to let them have a divided Intereſt; Such
States Men as do all this, ſtand like Rocks
againſt whom the Waves, ſtir'd and mov'd
forward by vulgar Breath, beat in Vain.
They are ſafe, Rever'd by the beſt ſort,
and the Darlings of the People; Such need
not fear the ſcanning of their Actions,
Popular Anger, nor the ſecret Machinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of diſcontented Perſons; Their Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence
is their ſure Guard, Arm'd with which,
they are not apprehenſive of <hi>Impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From what has been here ſaid peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
it will appear, that mix'd Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
are not to be long preſerved under
their old Form, unleſs ſuch as repreſent
their Country <hi>Do hold a ſtrong hand over
the Men of Buſineſs, calling thoſe to an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt,
who either through Folly or upon ſome
wicked Deſign, perſue Diſtructive Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But this high Cordial is not to be us'd
upon every flight Occaſion; 'twas never
intended by our Anceſtors to encounter
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:93970:173"/>
ſtempers better Cur'd another way, and
to be then only Adminiſtred when the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
Politick was ſick at Heart. Nothing
can be Admir'd and Awful that at every
turn is expoſed to common View; <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachments</hi>
are the Laws Supreme Sword
which ſhould be Drawn only to cut off
great Offences; It ſhould hang high, with
the Scabard on, over the Heads and in the
View of ſuch as meddle in Matters of State,
and when 'tis unſheath'd, it ſhould be in
a Way and Manner ſo very Terrible, as to
make all Offenders Tremble.</p>
               <p>If in Times to come, our Affairs ſhould
happen to be under an ill Adminiſtration,
the Calamities that muſt thereby fall up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
all Degrees of Men (thoſe excepted
who ſhall have enrich'd themſelves by the
Publick Spoils) will ſtir up the Legiſlative
Authority to Interpoſe in looking after our
future Safety.</p>
               <p>And at ſuch a ſeaſon perhaps it will be
thought the Sublimeſt Wiſdom of all, not
to be angry with Perſons but to mend
Things, and that it will not Import much
tho the Criminal ſcape unpuniſh'd, ſo the
Fault can be Corrected. The remorſe and
ſhame of having, may be, in a few Years
ruin'd a Rich and Flouriſhing People (for
ſo the Caſe may happen) will be Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
enough to thoſe who have left in 'em
any ſeeds of Honour.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="307" facs="tcp:93970:173"/>
Such therefore as mean their Country
well in an unhappy Juncture of this Nature
when they go to give Affairs a better Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion,
ſhould in all likelihood begin their
Work by Determining and Pronouncing
<hi>What Councils have been di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
againſt the Law, what
Advices have Tended to Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poveriſh
the Crown and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
and what Practices have

                     </gap>aſure.</hi>
And when in this Solemn Manner they
have Condemn'd the Offences, if they think
fit, the Offenders may be reach'd with
Eaſe.</p>
               <p>If we ſhould ever have a Set of Stateſ-Men
whoſe Offences will compel the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to Accuſe them, they will endeavour
to cover their own Faults by recriminating
upon the Proceedings of former times. If
they are Charg'd with waſting the Publick
Treaſure, with giving away the Crown-Lands,
with aiming at Arbitrary Power,
and to Govern by the Sword, they will be
ſo Audacious to think they ſtand juſtify'd
by anſwering, <hi>The ſame things were heretofore
done.</hi> But they ought to make this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection,
that King <hi>Charles</hi> was in danger to
looſe his Crown, and that King <hi>James</hi>
                  <pb n="308" facs="tcp:93970:174"/>
actually loſt it; becauſe his Miniſters per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſu'd
Meaſures diſtructive to the Kingdom.</p>
               <p>And now in a few Words to Re-capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulate
the whole Matter of this long Secti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
If ſuch as repreſent the People are
Uncorrupt, Unbyaſs'd and Diſintereſted.
If they diligently attend the Nation's Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.
if they carefully watch Encroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
upon the Conſtitution. If they make
Proviſion againſt future Evils. If they look
Narrowly into the Debts and Expences of
the Nation. If they hold a ſtrong Hand
over the Men of Buſineſs. And if in this
Manner <hi>Private Perſons perform their Duty
to the Publick,</hi> we ſhall not fail in all ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
Times, to ſee <hi>a ſteddy Courſe of
Honeſty and Wiſdom in ſuch as are truſted
with the Adminiſtration of Affairs.</hi> For it
may be laid down for a certain Maxim,
That States-Men will hardly be Negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent,
Corrupt or Arbitrary, when they
are over-look'd with careful Eyes by ſo
Conſiderable a Part of the Conſtitution.</p>
               <p>And where Things are well Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter'd
<hi>That Country will always increaſe in
Wealth and Power.</hi> Have we not before
our Eyes the Example of <hi>Spain,</hi> labouring
under Publick and Private Wants, occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd
by nothing but a long Series of Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>government?
What has preſerv'd the <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netians</hi>
for thirteen Centuries againſt ſuch
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:93970:174"/>
Potent Leagues as have been frequently
form'd againſt 'em, but that the goodneſs
of their Conſtitution has enabl'd them to
do great things with a very little? Would
People under a Tiranny, or indeed under
a better Form of Government ill manag'd,
have defended themſelves with ſuch Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
as <hi>Venice</hi> and <hi>Holland</hi> have done? Did
ever Countries fight ſo Bravely for their
Oppreſſors, as Nations that have contend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the Defence of their own Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties?
Where Matters are in a tottering
Condition, do not the People grow ſullen
and loath to venture their Stocks out of
their ſight? Is it not ſeen that at ſuch a
time Men hoard their Mony up which
ſhould Circulate in Trade? When the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
are under Apprehenſions that ill Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
at home will at laſt produce Wars,
Dangers and Invaſions from abroad, have
they not in all Ages at ſuch a Seaſon inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
their Foreign Traffick, Manufa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures
and other Buſineſs? What begets
general Induſtry, but hopes to have Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty
preſerv'd? Is it not evident that tho
here and there a Private Man accumulates
great Riches under an Abſolute Monarchy,
yet that the whole Body of the People is
always poor and miſerable in Countries ſo
Govern'd? What encourages Men, with
infinite Care, Labour, and Hazzard, to
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:93970:175"/>
gather private Wealth, which enriches the
Publick at laſt, but the hopes that ſtability
of Affairs, prudent Conduct, and juſt Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration,
may produce Peace, Securi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and laſting Empire? Where Men have
a Proſpect of all this, Strangers reſort thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with their Wealth and Stocks, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
Merchants and other Cautious Perſons
abandon Countries, whoſe Follies and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions
ſubject 'em to continual Changes
and frequent Revolutions, ſo that perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture
upon ſolid Reaſons and very juſt
Grounds, we may lay down, That nothing
more Contributes to make a Nation Gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
in the general Ballance of Trade, than
good Laws well obſerv'd, and a conſtant
Courſe of Honeſt and ſteddy Government.</p>
               <p>As Trade and Riches have their Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
Foundation in the Liberty and Laws
of a Country, ſo when thoſe great Springs
go right, they ſet in Motion the Engine
of a Common-Wealth, tho ſome other
Wheels may happen to be out of Order.</p>
               <p>To have the Courſe of Law and Courts
of Judicature proceed uncorruptly, is
ſuch a Remainder of Strength and Health,
as may in time help to recover the other
ſickly Parts of a Conſtitution.</p>
               <p>So that a Nation is not deprav'd beyond
all hope of Cure, which has in the Chief
Seats of Judgment, Men of deep Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:93970:175"/>
Probity, Moderation and Integrity.</p>
               <p>We ſhall Conclude this laſt Section

                  <q>Unleſs Princes uſe
their utmoſt Endeavours to regulate the
divers Orders of their State; If they are
Negligent in the Choice of a good Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil;
If they diſpiſe their wholeſom Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
unleſs they take a particular Care
to become ſuch that their Example may
prove a ſpeaking Voice; If they are Neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent
in Eſtabliſhing the Reign of God,
that of Reaſon, and that of Juſtice to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.
If they fail to protect Innocence,
to recompence Signal Services to the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick,
and to puniſh Diſobedience, and
the Crimes which trouble the Order, the
Diſcipline, and Safety of States; unleſs
they apply themſelves to foreſee and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
the Evils that may happen, and to
divert by careful Negotiations the Storms
which Clouds drive before them from a
greater Diſtance than is thought; If
Favour hinders them from making a
good choice of thoſe they Honour with
great Employments, and with the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
Offices of the Kingdom; If on all
Occaſions they do not prefer Publick
Intereſt to Private Advantages, tho o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe
never ſo good Livers, they will
be found more guilty than thoſe who
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:93970:176"/>
actually tranſgreſs the Commands and
Laws of God, it being certain that to
omit what we are oblig'd to do, and
to commit what we ought not to do, is
the ſame thing.</q>
