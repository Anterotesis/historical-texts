            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <bibl>MAT. 12. 25.</bibl>
                  <p>And Jeſus knew their thoughts, and ſaid unto them,
Every Kingdom divided againſt it ſelf is brought
to deſolation; and every City or Houſe divided
againſt it ſelf, ſhall not ſtand.</p>
               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THere are ſome Truths ſo clear in their
own Evidence, that tho they give us light
to prove other things, yet they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
admit of no Proof, but are to be
reckoned amongſt thoſe Notices that the
Mind naturally has, which ſhe can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſhake off, nor diſpute. Among thoſe this in my Text
is to be numbred; for Union and Peace in Society, as it
is the chief End and Deſign of all thoſe Combinations of
Men that run together; ſo it is the main Support of every
State. And tho Governments have differed in almoſt all
other Maxims; ſome being founded on Vertue, others on
Vice; ſome intended to carry on Juſtice, and others ſet
up on Robbery and Piracy; yet all agree in this, that they
muſt have Peace at home: And tho many have differed
in the Premiſes, how to compaſs it; yet all agree in the
Concluſion, that it muſt be purchaſed at any rate. A
Government that admits of Hoſtility at home, muſt ſoon
turn <hi>Felo de ſe;</hi> for this is as a Diſeaſe that conſumes the
Vitals, and when they are waſted, the exhauſted Carcaſe will
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:53102:3"/>
be expoſed to every Beaſt of Prey that ſeeks to devour it.
A Man inwardly ſound can reſiſt many Accidents, and
live after many Wounds, and a great Loſs of Blood and
Spirits; whereas he that is vitiated within, is feeble in
every thing that he undertakes, and eaſily overthrown
by any Impreſſion made upon him: So the mightieſt
States, when broken within themſelves, are too weak for
a much leſs Power that is entire.</p>
            <p>Theſe things are ſo plain, that it were a loſs of Time and
Words to dwell upon them. And ſo our Saviour refers
to them, being to anſwer the moſt malicious and
unreaſonable Cavil that ever was, by which the Phariſees
endeavoured to take off the Conviction which his Miracles
had left on all that ſaw them, repreſenting him an Impoſtor,
and in confederacy with the Prince of Darkneſs, ſo that
theſe marvellous Effects followed upon that Agreement.
This they at this time only whiſpered amongſt themſelves,
perhaps they only thought it; but Chriſt, to give them
a further diſcovery of that Divine Power that dwelt in
him, ſhewed that he had another of God's Attributes
communicated to him, his Omniſcience, as well as his Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotence,
for he knew their thoughts. And being to
confute this, ſo as it ſhould not be poſſible to reply upon
him, he begins with the Words in my Text, as a Maxim
ſo certain, that all Conſtitutions, good or bad, muſt agree
in it, All that are aſſociated into any Body muſt take care
not to deſtroy themſelves. And therefore ſince his whole
Doctrine tended to the advancement of the Glory of God,
to the bearing down of all Vice, Immorality, and Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief,
which are the Strong-Holds of Satan, and of that
ridiculous and impious Way of Worſhip, and Idolatry,
which was ſet up by the Devil's means, the Inference was
as certain, as any Propoſition in <hi>Euclid</hi> is, that therefore
there was no ſecret Compact between them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:53102:3"/>
I ſhall ſay no more on the Occaſion that led our Saviour
to ſpeak theſe Words, but ſhall come to conſider them in
themſelves; I ſhall not enter into a Panegyrick of Unity,
or a Declamation aganſt Diſcord, a Man may as well praiſe
Light, or commend Health, or ſhew his Eloquence in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paraging
the Gout or Stone; theſe things are ſuch, that
every Hearer is before hand convinced of them. I ſhall
therefore handle this Subject wholly with reſpect to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
that ſo it may become this Place and Occaſion,
and ſhall ſpeak to theſe Heads.</p>
            <list>
               <item>I. There is nothing that defeats the Ends of Religion
more, and does more naturally lead to all manner of Sin
and Impiety, which muſt end in Temporal as well as Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Ruin, than inteſtine Heats and Diviſions about it.</item>
               <item>2. The Beginnings of Heats are often very inconſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,
but by a confluence of unhappy Circumſtances they
ſoon grow to be almoſt incurable; A Diviſion will end in
Deſtruction. And therefore the firſt Motions towards
them ought to be watched over, and ſtopp'd, otherwiſe
theſe Bodies ſo divided cannot long ſtand.</item>
               <item>3. I ſhall ſhew the Weakneſs of all thoſe Pretences that
are uſed to juſtify Factions and Diviſions.</item>
               <item>4. I ſhall propoſe to you the Remedies, to which
the Goſpel directs us, for the preventing and curing this
Miſchief. And,</item>
               <item>5. I ſhall plainly apply all to our preſent Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and the Buſineſs of this Day. To return,</item>
            </list>
            <p n="1">1. There is nothing that defeats the Ends of Religion
more, and does more naturally lead to all manner of Sin,
Immorality, and Vice, which muſt bring on Ruine in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion,
than inteſtine Heats and Diviſions. If we have
a right Notion of Religion, we will not conſider it only
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:53102:4"/>
as a Syſteme of Opinions, or a Circle of ſome Forms, much
leſs as an Engine to raiſe the Credit and Intereſt of a Sort
of Men that diſpenſe it; but as an internal Principle and
Diſcipline, which tames and governs the Mind, and all
its Motions and Appetites, and directs the Courſe of ones
Life. Now the irregular Propenſities that are in every
one, ſome being of one ſort, and ſome of another, are
ſo violent and ſudden, that the firſt performance of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
is to qualify and break theſe. This cannot be
done without much thought, and great recollection; and
in order to that a ſerene and calm Temper is the beſt Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
poſſible; of which the Philoſophers were ſo
aware, that they began their Inſtructions at thoſe purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Doctrines, before they carried on their Auditors to
their ſublimer Speculations. And the Quiet of a Society
is not more neceſſary to the Happineſs and Advancement
of it, than quiet Thoughts are to make a Man wiſe or
good. Therefore every thing that raiſes Diſturbances
within is to be guarded againſt, as that which not only
produces the Miſchiefs that viſibly attend it, but really puts
a Man quite out of order, ſlackens the Watch he ought
to have over himſelf, and ſets him on to, or at leaſt very
gently excuſes him to himſelf, in many unjuſt and violent
things, which ſeem often almoſt neceſſary to the ſupport
of an Intereſt or Party.</p>
            <p>Theſe Heats are bad enough, if grounded upon Civil
Matters; but in thoſe there is ſtill ſome Check from the
Thoughts of Religion, or the Return of a Sacrament-Day,
which will in ſome meaſure bring a Man into Tune,
and will at leaſt let him ſee he is out of the way. But if
they are grounded on Differences of Religion, the Evil
is leſs curable,<note place="margin">Mat. 6. 23.</note> 
               <hi>If the Light that is in us be Darkneſs, how
great is that Darkneſs!</hi> That which will moderate our
other Quarrels, encreaſes this, when we imagine we are
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:53102:4"/>
doing God good Service; and ſo the more ſtrict we are,
we become the more hot and peeviſh; in which we will
not only be applauding our ſelves, but inſtead of being
reproved for it by thoſe, who would perhaps chide us for
Animoſities in other things, we will be cheriſhed and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged
by them, as Perſons zealous in their Matters, or as
many call them, in the Concerns of Religion. In this we will
by degrees become ſo corrupted, that one of the worſt
Vices will carry the Name of one of the beſt Vertues, our
Wrath and Malice will be called Zeal. The ill Effects
that this will have on our ſelves will be, that as this Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
grows upon us, all our inward Seriouſneſs will in a
great meaſure abate, and turn meerly to a Form; and
with that many other Sins will creep in upon us; yea, we
will perhaps grow to that degree, that we will imagine,
that by our Rage and Heat we offer up ſome acceptable
Sacrifice to God, to compenſate for our other Diſorders.
We will bear with many ill things in others, becauſe they
are of our Party, whom otherwiſe we would deteſt for
their ill Lives; and by converſing much with them, we
will contract at leaſt a Familiarity with their Vices. And
it is very likely the Contagion will not ſtop at that, there
will follow a Train of the moſt unjuſt and malicious
Things poſſible; ſuch as the making and ſpreading Lies
and Calumnies, and the ſupporting them by Oaths and
Villanies. And if this Humor goes on, it will carry thoſe
that are corrupted with it to Perſecution, if they have
Power, and to Rebellion if they have not. And <hi>Oppreſſion
will make a wiſe Man mad,</hi> but much more one that is
weak and miſ-led.</p>
            <p>And thus a Man ſuffers mightily in the Peace and Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of his Mind, by admitting thoſe ſoure and ill-natured
Paſſions into it. And Societies ſuffer no leſs: The private
Affections of Relations, the Kindneſs of Neighbour-hoods,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:53102:5"/>
the Order of Corporations, and the Strength of a Nation,
are diſſolved by nothing ſo much, as by thoſe peeviſh and
ill-temper'd Humors: So that the Publick Peace, and the
Security of the Whole, is ſacrificed to thoſe domeſtick
Heats, whilſt every Party is more concerned to ruine the
other, than even to preſerve themſelves by a common De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence.
And thoſe Heats once kindled, burn longer, and
deeper, and are apt to break out after they ſeem to be
quenched, when ever a new Opportunity blows upon
them.</p>
            <p>That this Temper is certainly followed with thoſe Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects,
will eaſily appear to every one that has ſeriouſly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
the Advances it has made upon himſelf, if at any
time he has given way to it. And thoſe who have looked
into the Hiſtories of paſt Times, ſee almoſt in every Age
the Ruins that it has made; as Rocks are known by the
Wrecks that float about them.</p>
            <p>Shall I tell you what havock this made among the Jews?
what a deſperate and mad ſort of Robbers and Murderers
their Zealots became? The Humor was far advanced
when St. <hi>Paul</hi> was one of them; for he going under the
authority of that Character, <hi>made havock of the Church, and
went from City to City, to impriſon and bind all that called on
the Name of Chriſt.</hi> This grew afterwards to a pitch of Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
that is ſcarce credible, if we had not ſo good a Voucher
for it as <hi>Joſephus,</hi> who was an Eye-witneſs. When the Power
of the Roman Empire, under which the whole World did
bend, came againſt them, ſo that it was neceſſary for them,
either to prevent their Ruine by an early Submiſſion, or
to defend themſelves from it with an united Strength;
the Rage that was among the ſeveral Parties ſo diſtracted
their Councels, and diſordered their Deſigns, that they
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:53102:5"/>
could neither prudently ſubmit, nor generouſly reſiſt, but
they languiſhed away in Famine, or deſtroyed one another
in thoſe unnatural Broils within their Walls. When God
bleſs'd his Church with Peace and Protection, and after a
long Trial, during three Ages and ten Perſecutions, raiſed
up a Nurſing-Father to it; ſoon after that two Conteſts aroſe.
One was about a perſonal thing in <hi>Cecilian,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage,</hi>
Whether he, or his Ordainers, had denied the Faith,
and delivered up the Sacred Writings, in the former Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution?
The other was concerning a ſpeculative and
myſterious Point of the Eternal Generation of the Word,

waſted Chriſtendom to ſuch a degree, that it was viſible
thoſe aſtoniſhing Judgments were not the Puniſhments of
ordinary Sins. And all the Evils that were among the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
flowing in a great meaſure from thoſe Heats about

on Confuſion, and every evil Work, I may lay the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing

Heats did they fall with the old <hi>Britains,</hi> concerning
the Obſervation of Eaſter, in which we now certainly
know, that neither Side underſtood the Point they
debated about. But they were more ſet on that,
and other Superſtitious Conceits, than on a real
Converſion of the Nation. And how was this Iſland
plagued after that, by the Incurſions and Depredati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
which the <hi>Danes</hi> made for near two Ages?
The Conteſts between the Greek and Latin Church
ended in the Ruine of the Eaſtern Empire; and the
Triumphs of the Creſcent over the Croſs, were in a
great meaſure to be aſcribed unto that moſt unhappy
Breach.</p>
            <p>I ſhall purſue this no more; the thing is plain to
common Obſervation, and needs not to be fortified with
much Proof.</p>

               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:53102:6"/>
It is as certain as any humane thing can poſſibly be, that
when any Body of men are engaged againſt a Common
Enemy, and yet divided among themſelves and jealous
of one another, they will rather let the Enemy prevail
than aſſiſt their brethren, even in the wiſeſt and beſt
things, if they think the honour of ſuch actions will raiſe
the credit of their Rivals. And thus if their ſtrength were
ever ſo much ſuperiour to the Enemies; yet when his
force is united, and theirs disjointed, they muſt become a
prey to him: but this will hold more certainly if the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Enemy is really ſtronger than they are, though uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
In ſuch a caſe their heats among themſelves are ſo
unaccountable, that though the World is naturally fooliſh
enough, yet it is not to be ſuppoſed that meer folly could
carry ſuch a madneſs ſo far; there is more reaſon to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe
it to the ſecret practices of corrupted and perfidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
men, who are imployed, and may be hired, to be Incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diaries
perhaps on both ſides. For a wiſe and watchful Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
when one Plot fails, will ſoon ſet up another; and
will think it an extraordinary happineſs, if without the
infamy of an Aſſaſſination of a <hi>Gun-powder Plot,</hi> which
they would not chooſe but upon extremities, they can
make their adverſaries ſo ſpend their ſtrength one againſt
another, that they ſhall either deliver themſelves up to
them, or be able to make a very faint reſiſtance to a
vigorous impreſſion: And there is no deſign ſo certain as
the inflaming of diviſions among their adverſaries; and that
both in Church and State: which when they are once
brought to that paſs, that both ſides have vowed revenge,
either party will be ſo intent on their little deſigns, that
the whole muſt periſh: And ſome will perhaps come to
think it ſafer to truſt themſelves to the mercy of their
adverſary, than to the reſentments of enraged Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try-men.
And thus will they bite and devour one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:53102:7"/>

            <p n="2">2. The beginnings of thoſe heats are often very inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable;
but by a confluence of unhappy Circumſtances,
they ſoon grow to be almoſt incurable. It is but a diviſion
at firſt, but that will end in ruin. All our evils flow from our
own ill humours; and whatever excites or provokes theſe,
be it how inconſiderable ſoever in its own nature, yet its
effects will grow great and remarkable. In Civil matters it
is ſo. What a trifling thing was it among the <hi>Romans</hi> to be
of the faction of the <hi>Veneti</hi> or <hi>Praſini,</hi> that betted for match<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
in the Cirque, which were diſtinguiſhed by a Livery?
yet this produced great Convulſions in the Imperial City;
and when the Emperour hapned to be of either ſide,
that party of which he was, thought they had an au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
to exerciſe great Cruelties on all the other faction.
But this is much more dangerous, if the ground of the
difference is any point of Religion, though ever ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different
in it ſelf: What heats aroſe concerning the day on
which <hi>Eaſter</hi> was to be obſerved? How little did it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
Religion, what <hi>Cecilian,</hi> or his Ordainers were, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially
in the age after they were dead? And yet not
only a ſeparation and violent rage, but a great effuſion
of blood, with the other diſmal conſequences of that
blind fury, followed upon this, and the <hi>Africans</hi> continued
quarrelling about it, till the <hi>Vandals</hi> came and deſtroyed
both the one and the other. And ſurely many of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſts
about myſteries, began at ſome unwary expreſſions,
in which the one ſide faſtned ill ſences on the words ſpoken
by the other; and the other, rather than yield ſo far for
peace ſake, as to explain themſelves, chooſed rather to
juſtifie their words in any ſenſe, than to retract or molli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:53102:7"/>
them: And can we think without aſtoniſhment that
ſuch matters as giving the Sacrament in leavened,
or unleavened bread; or an explication of the proceſſion
of the Holy Ghoſt, whether it was from the Father and the
Son, or from the Father by the Son, could have rent the
<hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latine</hi> Churches ſo violently one from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
that the <hi>Latines</hi> rather than aſſiſt the other, lookt
on, till they were deſtroyed by the <hi>Othoman</hi> Family,
which has ever ſince been ſo terrible a Neighbour to
the reſt of <hi>Europe!</hi> Oft-times one conteſt beeds another;
and that which perhaps began at a ſpeculative point ends
in a practical one; and that which begins in ſome Rite or
Ceremony, grows at laſt to a breach in matters of Faith.</p>
            <p>The conteſts whether Chriſt had one or two wills, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
determined by the ſixth General Council againſt the
<hi>Monothelites,</hi> they by their intereſt at Court, got that Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly
to be decried; ſo that a Picture of the Fathers that
ſate there being hung up in a great Church, was removed,
and thoſe that removed it ſaid to excuſe themſelves,
that no Pictures or Images ought to be in Churches.
Upon this thoſe of the other party did violently contend,
that Images ought not only to be ſet up, but Worſhipped;
and this produced great diſorders in the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> under two
or three revolutions of the Court: and in concluſion,
<hi>Italy</hi> ſhook off the Emperours Authority by the Popes
inſtigation, becauſe he brake the Images. And this gave
the riſe to another queſtion, whether the Sacrament was
only the Image of Chriſt as the one party aſſerted, or was
the very ſubſtance of his body. Both had Councils, which
in thoſe Ages paſt for General ones, of their ſide. To
what has the different explications of the preſence of
Chriſt in the Sacrament made by <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Zuin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glius,</hi>
riſen, though it lies merely in ſpeculation? It has raiſed
ſuch an alienation, that in many places the <hi>Lutherans</hi> are no
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:53102:8"/>
leſs, and in ſome they are more fierce, againſt the <hi>Calviniſts;</hi>
than againſt Papiſts. Like a ſtrange ſort of people among
our ſelves, that are not aſhamed to own a greater averſion
to any ſort of Diſſenters, than to the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to come nearer home; To what has a conteſt that
began at firſt about Hoods and Surplices riſen amongſt us?
Thoſe points upon which it began, have been long ago
yielded up as indifferent; but new matter will ſoon be
found out by thoſe who have a mind to ſearch for it.
In the laſt age the heats about Divine Decrees, and the
Moralitie of the Lords day, almoſt deſtroyed us. Now
as there is no difference at all remaining about the one,
Divines agreeing, as much to preſs the obſervation of
it, as the greater part of the Nation does in profaning it;
ſo in the other, the myſteriouſneſs of thoſe points being ſo
very much enquired into, there have been ſuch moderate
methods uſed in handling them of both ſides, that there
are now no more heats concerning them: But alas,
though ſome things fall off, I do not know how it comes
that this Monſter ſhoots out always new heads, and
there grow up new Subjects for debate and anger; and
though at preſent there are no conſiderable Conteſts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
us about any Doctrinal points, yet we are not a
whit the nearer an agreement: the reaſon is, the alienation
of our minds ſtands or rather grows ſtill, and this is of late
blown up to ſuch a degree by ſome venemous Libels and
Pamphlets, that in the midſt of Peace and plenty we
ſeem to be in a poſture of War. And what will the
end of theſe things be? if this fermentation goes on, it
will burſt out at laſt, and upon the firſt unlucky Criſis
it muſt produce diſmal effects.</p>
            <p>It is not ſo much to be conſidered what are the grounds
of conteſts in matters of Religion, as what is the temper
with which they are managed. Things of great mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:53102:8"/>
may be managed by men of prudent and calm
tempers in ſo ſoft a manner, that none of their differences
ſhall be able to divide them: and the inconſiderableſt things
poſſible, may by the ill natured ſophiſtry of angry men,
be raiſed up to ſeem matters of the greateſt moment.
For it is but the faſtning an ill name, or an ill conſequence
to any opinion, that will do it; and then ſince a conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
if rightly inferred, is really involved in that upon
which it follows, it is given out as the ſenſe of a whole par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
which deteſts the conſequence, and would forſake the
opinion if they could but be perſwaded that it really
belonged to it. It is in ſtrife as in the letting out of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
a vent to the leaſt meaſure does dilute and ſpread.
Therefore the Wiſe man adviſes us <hi>to leave off conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
before it be medled with.</hi> It may ſeem a contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
to leave it off before it is medled with; but we are
ſo early to retire from all contention, that as ſoon as it
appears, and before we have engaged in it, we muſt break
it off. For if we are once ingaged, humour, honour and
other peeviſh or deſigning men will hold us to it: it is
beſt to break it off in time, otherwiſe we ſhall have
reaſon to cry out often with St. <hi>James, Behold how great
a matter a little fire hath kindled.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. I now go on to the Third particular, which is to ſhew
how vain and unreaſonable all thoſe pretences are, that
are made uſe of to ſupport this hot and bitter temper.
I ſhall reduce them to theſe Four. Firſt, Zeal for truth. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
A care to preſerve our ſelves. Thirdly, Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities
from the Old Teſtament. Fourthly, Authorities
from the New. For the firſt,</p>
            <p>It is true we ought to be zealouſly affected in a good
thing; we ought indeed to be much concerned in every
thing that relates to our eternal happineſs hereafter, and
to thoſe means that diſpoſe and lead us to it here. But there
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:53102:9"/>
is alſo a bitter zeal, which is reckoned among the works
of the fleſh, and a zeal without knowledge. That zeal
which is acceptable to God, muſt be ſuitable to his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
full of goodneſs, mercy and compaſſion. If it makes
us hate, defame or perſecute our brother, we are ſure this
is not that zeal which will commend us to God. In a
word, true zeal is, when out of an inward ſenſe of the
goodneſs of God, and of the excellency of Religion,
we have an earneſt concern in our minds, that other
men may honour and ſerve him, and participate in thoſe
joyes which we feel in Religion. A little reflection on
our ſelves and our ſecret thoughts will ſoon reſolve the
point, whether it is malice and revenge for ſome injury
ſuppoſed or real, whether it is ſome ſecret deſign and
private end that we diſguiſe with the name of zeal, or a
ſincere affection to Religion and the ſouls of our bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
that governs us. We ought alſo to be well aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
both of the truth and importance of thoſe things
on which we imploy our zeal, and not let it run out impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuouſly
on every trifle, and we are ſtill to watch over our
tempers, leſt our heat carry us too far. And we muſt
never forget that we ought to be zealous for peace as
well as truth. Can it be ſuppoſed that thoſe who live in all
ſorts of debaucheries and impieties, are either zealous for
the Church on the one hand, or for the Proteſtant Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
as they pretend, on the other? If theſe things will
ſcarce paſs with wiſe men, much leſs will they paſs with
that God, who ſees the heart. It is certain, Zeal muſt never
exclude Charity; for the love of God, and our Neighbour
is the foundation of it. Whatever has not this at bottom
is but the dreg of Education, the ſowrneſs of a party, and
a thin diſguiſe for black deſigns.</p>
            <p>The ſecond pretence is Safety. I am not to meddle with
the publick ſecurity of government, that is a ſubject above
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:53102:9"/>
me: I ſpeak with relation to private perſons and their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment.
All Zealots apprehend themſelves in ſome
danger from thoſe againſt whom they are ſet;
if their numbers are ſmall, they fear that they will
become greater; and if they are great, they fear they
will maſter them: and ſo they indeavour to conquer them,
firſt in point of reputation in the battels of the tongue
and pen, by defaming them, either diſcovering real
faults, or forging calumnies to diſgrace them; and
then in point of intereſt inſinuating themſelves into
ſuch as they can have acceſs to, and indeavouring to
work the ruine of thoſe who differ from them. If
there were no other meaſures to be taken in matters
of Religion, but the Maximes of humane Policy, this
might paſs for tolerably prudent: But St. <hi>James</hi> tells
us, the Wiſdom of that bitter zeal, <hi>is not from above,
it is earthly, ſenſual and deviliſh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Bonds of a man,</hi> and <hi>the cords of love</hi> are thoſe, by
which God uſes to draw us; and in imitation of
that, the methods of reaſon, and the wayes of meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
are both more ſuitable to the Divine Nature, and
more likely to work on the greater part of men: In
following theſe which God has appointed, we may
with confidence depend upon his protection and bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing;
and if the petulancies and follies of ſome make
it at any time neceſſary to puniſh them, it ſhould ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear,
that what they ſuffer is the correction of a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
or Brother, and not the wound of an enemy,
or the laſh of a Jaylor. Extream heats if not repreſſed
will carry to extream ſeverities. And perhaps no ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verities
are very prudent, except they be extream, as
are the Inquiſitions of <hi>Spain;</hi> but we may ſee what the
Church of <hi>Rome</hi> has gained by their cruelties in the laſt
Age. Violence alienates thoſe further, whom we
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:53102:10"/>
ought to gain upon, and likewiſe increaſes their party by
the compaſſions of all good-natured people, who are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
firſt inclined to pity them, then to love them, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
in concluſion to go over to them: and ſo the ſharpneſs
of rigour inſtead of being a ſecurity, often proves the ruin
of thoſe who depend on it: whereas the wayes of love
and meekneſs will work more univerſally and effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally,
at leaſt to mollifie if not to turn thoſe with whom
we deal; and it draws all people who are leſs ingaged
in their affections, to adhere to thoſe who are mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate:
The very appearances of a calm temper have a
charm in them, but the effects of them in concurrence
with other prudent methods, are almoſt irreſiſtible. In
ſumm, it is better to be overrun and ruined in the wayes
of meekneſs, than to conquer all the World by cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty;
in the one we bear the croſs and ſuffer for righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs
ſake; in the other we triumph in the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of Anti-chriſt dyed red with the blood of thoſe
who though in errours, yet may be good men in the
main for ought we know.</p>
            <p>The third pretence, is from the ſeverities of the old
Teſtament, and that ſpirit of zeal, which was ſo much
commended and ſet up for a pattern in the Inſtances
of <hi>Phinehas, Elijah,</hi> and others. But our Saviour an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
this when he was deſired to ſuffer his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
to imitate <hi>Elijah,</hi> and to call for fire from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven;
that was becauſe they could not kindle it upon
earth, otherwiſe they had begun there; but our meek
and lowly Saviour rebuked them, and told them, <hi>They
knew not what Spirit they were of:</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> 9. 55.</note> 
               <hi>And that the ſon
of Man came not to deſtroy mens lives, but to ſave them.</hi>
That people was fierce and untractable, and as they had
the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> by an immediate grant from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven;
ſo the Civil Government was kept in the hand
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:53102:10"/>
of God; and ſharp puniſhments were inflicted on thoſe
that broke thoſe Laws by which they held all their poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions:
But the diſpenſation of the Goſpel is wholly
Spiritual upon another bottom, and to be managed in
another method.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, The laſt excuſe for theſe heats is from the
practice of our Saviour, who ſeverely laid open the hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſies
of the Phariſees; and the Apoſtles who writ
warmly againſt falſe Teachers, by which a ſharpneſs
in ſpeaking and writing ſeems well warranted. But
if we conſider that our Saviour certainly knew the
Phariſees were Hypocrites, and did by the ſhew of ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
miſlead the people, ſo that they were in danger
to periſh by their falſe Doctrines, and that no meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
no reaſon, no nor the moſt wonderful miracles
which he wrought, could work upon them; it was
neceſſary for the good of others to expoſe them. So
if we manifeſtly ſee an Hypocritical ſort of people miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leading
the World in points that indanger their ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
and are well aſſured that what we ſay is true,
and that fairer means cannot prevail; we not only may
but ought to diſcover this: But this will not excuſe
thoſe who believe every ſtory, and propagate it meerly
out of hatred to others, and know in their own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences
that their chief concern is to diſgrace thoſe
they hate, and not to preſerve others, out of a principle
of charity to them. There muſt be a great evidence
to make us conclude a man an Hypocrite, even ſome
one ill act will not amount to it: nothing but ſome very
heinous crime, or an ill courſe in ſome ſin, which the
common illumination of all Chriſtians diſcovers to be
evil, and which they diſguiſe with a colour of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
ought to juſtifie the faſtning this black imputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:53102:11"/>
on any: For God knows in how ill colours many
would appear, if ſome of their ſecret actions were made
publick, which may ſeem, and indeed are, heinous; and
yet they having truly repented of them, ought not
to be ſo branded. We ought to judge charitably,
and to be ready alwayes to put the beſt reaſonable
conſtruction on other mens actions, that upon a fair re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation
they will bear; and make ſuch allowances
for the errours and failings of others, as we know in
our own conſciences we would deſire to be made
for our own, if all the ſecrets of our lives were
known. They are known to God, and ought to be
remembred by our ſelves; and in thoſe caſes, he that
ſhews no mercy in his cenſures, is to expect judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
without mercy. But the force of this whole Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
will be better taken off by the fourth particular
that I propoſed,</p>
            <p n="4">4. Which is to conſider the methods that Chriſt and
his Apoſtles have preſcribed for bringing us to Love and
Unity.</p>
            <p>The whole life of our bleſſed Saviour was a continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
courſe of meekneſs, and lowlineſs of mind; and in
theſe he propoſes himſelf chiefly as a pattern for our
imitation;<note place="margin">Matth. 11. 29</note> and it is ſcarce poſſible for men to quarrel
much, that are under the influences of that happy tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per:
he hath made this the cogniſance, <hi>by which all
the World ſhall know his Diſciples,</hi>
               <note place="margin">John 13. 35.</note> 
               <hi>if they love one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:</hi>
And has not only charged us to love our Friends,
but our Enemies,<note place="margin">Matth. 5. 44.</note> Perſecutors and Slanderers; to bleſs
them, to pray for them, and to do them all the good that
is in our power. So that no excuſe of ill uſage can
give us a priviledge to hate, to rail at, or revenge
our ſelves of others. And we may ſee the ſenſe he had
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:53102:11"/>
of Unity and Peace among his followers, by his inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion
with his Father for it; ſince in that prayer of
his a little before he ſuffered for us, he in five ſeveral
places prays,<note place="margin">John 17. 18, 21, 22, 23.</note> 
               <hi>That they might be one, as the Father and
he were: That they might be one in them, and be made
perfect in one.</hi> And as our Saviour delivered this to his
Apoſtles, ſo they in every Epiſtle did repeat the ſame
exhortations with moſt vehement and mighty obte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtations,
as conſidering, That this was eſſential to the
very Being and preſervation of the Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</p>
            <p>A Controverſy aroſe then which raiſed great heats
concerning the obligation which the converted Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles
lay under to obſerve the Law of <hi>Moſes:</hi> and there
were ſome zealous Jews, who though they believed
in Chriſt, as the true Meſſias, yet they adhered ſo
fiercely to the Law, that they not only ſeparated from
the Apoſtles, but perſecuted them, becauſe they were
for freeing the Gentiles from that yoke. This was a
queſtion of far greater conſequence than thoſe are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
which we contend ſo earneſtly: but in this we
ſhall obſerve the gentleneſs of the Apoſtles, even to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
thoſe that did obſtinately diſſent from the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination
which they made, though it proceeded
from an infallible Authority. St. <hi>Paul</hi> writing to the
<hi>Romans,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 9. 3.</note> as he expreſſes his love to the Jews in ſo high
a ſtrain, that he was willing to be accurſed, that is,
caſt out of the Communion of Chriſtians, if that
would have induced them to come into it, (a very
high pitch of Charity, which needs not be raiſed high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
as ſome fanciful people have done:) he likewiſe
gives his ſenſe of their conteſts in thoſe matters
concerning the obſervation of their cuſtomes in two
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:53102:12"/>
ſpeculative Maximes; and in two practical rules, which
are of general uſe, and on which he inlarges copiouſly.
He firſt tells them, That on both ſides ſincere men might
ſo follow their perſwaſions as to be accepted of God.<note place="margin">

               <hi>He
that regardeth a day, regardeth it to the Lord: And he that
regardeth not a day, to the Lord he doth not regard it:</hi> He
further ſayes, That Religion lay not in ſuch trivial things;
<hi>The Kingdom of God,</hi>
               <note place="margin">17. v.</note> that is the diſpenſation of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,
<hi>conſiſted not in meats or drinks,</hi> (that is, in queſtions
about clean or unclean meats) <hi>but in righteouſneſs and
peace, and joy in the Holy Ghoſt:</hi> and that <hi>he who in theſe
things ſerved Chriſt, was acceptable to God and approved of men,</hi>
whatever he might think of other matters. Upon theſe
two concluſions he grafts two rules;<note place="margin">5, 21, 22.</note> the one is, That
every one ſhould follow the cleareſt light he could have,
<hi>and be fully perſwaded in his own mind,</hi> and to do what he
did upon an inward aſſurance, and <hi>without doubting:</hi> the
other is, That men ought not <hi>to judge, or ſet at nought
their Brethren;</hi>
               <note place="margin">3, 4, 10. v.</note> that <hi>the weaker ought not to judge the ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
nor the ſtronger to deſpiſe the weaker;</hi> and that <hi>all
ſhould follow after the things which made for peace,</hi>
               <note place="margin">19. v.</note> 
               <hi>by which
they might edifie one another.</hi> All this is plain and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſive.</p>
            <p>When he writ to the Corinthians, he expreſſes great
grief for what he had heard of their diviſions:<note place="margin">1 Cor. 1. 10, 11, 12.</note> Some
were <hi>for Paul,</hi> that is thoſe of the uncircumciſion: Some
<hi>for Cephas</hi> or <hi>Peter,</hi> that is, thoſe of the Circumciſion:
Some were <hi>for Apollo,</hi> that is, thoſe of St. <hi>John</hi>'s baptiſm:
And ſome were <hi>for Chriſt,</hi> who perhaps received Chriſt as
the Meſſias and yet rejected the Apoſtles: Upon which he
argues, That by this it appeared they <hi>were carnal and walkt
as men.</hi>
               <note place="margin">13. v.</note> And that they might not think he was partial to
thoſe that ſet up for himſelf, he particularly ſets himſelf a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:53102:12"/>
them. He alſo by an excellent Simile taken from
the ſeveral uſes of the members of the natural body,<note place="margin">12. Ch.</note> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horts
them all, not to deſpiſe one another, but that every
one in his ſtation ſhould be uſeful to the whole body, and
to every member in it: and runs out into one of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
raptures that is in the whole Scripture in commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of charity,<note place="margin">13. Ch.</note> which he calls not only, a more excellent
thing than all the extraordinary gifts that were then in
the Church; without which, doing miracles, ſuffering
Martyrdom, or the giving all one had to the poor
was nothing; but preferres it both to faith and
hope.</p>
            <p>Writing to the <hi>Galatians,</hi> though he incourages them
with more than ordinary earneſtneſs not to yield to the
Judaizers, yet he gives them this neceſſary caution, That
they ſhould <hi>by love ſerve one another,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gal. 5. 13, 14.</note> 
               <hi>for all the Law was
comprehended in this one word, Thou ſhalt love thy neighbour
as thy ſelf:</hi>
               <note place="margin">15. v.</note> And he adds theſe weighty words, on which we ſhould all reflect much, <hi>If ye bite and devour one another,
take heed ye be not conſumed one of another.</hi> And giving an
enumeration of the fruits of the ſpirit, he begins with
theſe,<note place="margin">22. v.</note> 
               <hi>love, joy, peace, long-ſuffering, gentleneſs and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi>
He alſo exhorts the <hi>Epheſians</hi> to this, as that by
which they ſhould approve themſelves as worthy of their
holy calling,<note place="margin">Epheſ. 4. 2, 3, 4, 5.</note> that <hi>They ſhould walk with all lowlineſs, meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
long-ſuffering, forbearing one another in love, indeavouring
to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace:</hi> And the
reaſons he gives for it are eternally ſtrong and binding:
<hi>There is one Lord,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Phil. 1. 15, 16, 17<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 18.</note> 
               <hi>one faith, one Baptiſm, and one God,
and Father of all.</hi> In his Epiſtle to the <hi>Philippians</hi> it
appears, how exactly he himſelf followed thoſe rules,
which he gave to others; for he being then a priſoner,
ſome that <hi>envied</hi> his labours in the Goſpel, and <hi>intended
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:53102:13"/>
to add affliction to his</hi> bonds, <hi>preached Chriſt not ſincerely,
but in pretence;</hi> yet he rejoyced that good was done by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
perſon whatſoever, and upon what motives ſoever.
And though men that ſuffer, are apt to be more touched
with inſultings and ill uſage from their own friends, than
they can be for any thing that their Enemies do to them;
yet this did no way diſorder him, nor did he thunder a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
thoſe Hypocritical and inſolent teachers. Upon
this he goes on to recommend that temper to others which
appeared ſo eminently in himſelf, and in the moſt ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
ſtrains of a true but moving Rhetorick he obteſts them,<note place="margin">Phil. 2. 1, 2, 3.</note>
               <hi>If there was any Conſolation in Chriſt, if any comforts of
Love, if any fellowſhip of the Spirit, if any bowels and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,
that they would fulfill his joy, and be like minded, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the ſame love, being of one accord, and of one mind:
and that nothing ſhould be done through ſtrife and vain
glory, but that in lowlineſs of mind, every one ſhould eſteem o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
better than themſelves.</hi> And in order to this he propoſes
to them the wonderful pattern of the humility and love
of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>How effectually does he exhort the <hi>Coloſſians</hi> to <hi>put
off all anger,<note place="margin">Col. 3. 8, 12, 13, 14, 15.</note> wrath, malice and Blaſphemy,</hi> that is, revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
and reproachful words, and to <hi>put on as the elect of
God holy and beloved, bowels of mercies, kindneſs, humble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of mind, meekneſs and long-ſuffering, forbearing one
another, and forgiving one another: If any man have a
quarrel againſt any, even as Chriſt forgave you, ſo alſo
do you; and above all things put on Charity, which is the
bond of perfection; and let the peace of God rule in your hearts,
to the which ye are called in one body.</hi> He heard the <hi>Theſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalonians</hi>were eminent for their mutual love,<note place="margin">1 Theſ. 4. v. 9, 10, 11.</note> ſo that it
was needleſs to exhort them to it, yet he beſeeches them<hi>to encreaſe in it more and more;</hi> and ſince much medling
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:53102:13"/>
or the running about, are the chief occaſions by which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions
ariſe, or ſpread;<note place="margin">5. 13, 14.</note> he charges them <hi>to ſtudy
to be quiet, and to do their own buſineſs: to be at peace a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
themſelves, to warn them that were unruly, to be
patient to all men, and not to render evil for evil, but ever to
follow that which was good.</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Tim. 6. 3, 4, 5.</note> And in his Epiſtles to <hi>Timothy</hi>he gives us the Characters both of falſe and true teachers
in relation to theſe things. Of the former he ſaies, <hi>They were
proud knowing nothing, but doting about queſtions and ſtrifes
of words,<note place="margin">2 Tim. 2. 24, 25, 26.</note> of which came envy, ſtrife, railings, evil ſurmiſings,
and perverſe diſputings of men of corrupt minds;</hi> but the
reverſe of this is, <hi>the ſervant of the Lord muſt not ſtrive,
but be gentle unto all men, apt to teach, patient in meekneſs,
inſtructing thoſe that oppoſe themſelves, if God peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
will give them repentance to the acknowledgment of
the truth.</hi> Inſinuating, that inſtruction given in the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of meekneſs, was the likelieſt way to bring this about.
He alſo exhorts <hi>Titus</hi> to <hi>put the</hi> Cretians <hi>in mind,<note place="margin">Titus 2. 1, 2.</note> to be
ſubject to Principalities and Powers, to obey Magiſtrates, to
be ready to every good work, to ſpeak evil of no man, not to be
brawlers but gentle, ſhewing all meekneſs to all men.</hi> The
chief ſcope of his Epiſtle to <hi>Philemon,</hi> is to perſwade
him to be reconciled to <hi>Oneſimus,</hi> who being his ſervant had
robbed him, and run away from him. He exhorts the<hi>Hebrews</hi> to <hi>provoke one another to love and to good works;<note place="margin">Heb. 10. 24, 25.</note>
               </hi>and in order to that,<note place="margin">Heb. 12. 14, 15.</note> 
               <hi>not to forſake the aſſembling them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
together as the manner of ſome was, and to follow peace
with all men:</hi> And to take care that no <hi>root of bitterneſs
might ſpring up and trouble them, by which many might be
defiled.</hi> For Diſſenſions are the buddings of bitterneſs in the
mind, and do both diſturb and corrupt thoſe in whom
they grow up.</p>
            <p>Nor was this a ſtile peculiar to St. <hi>Paul;</hi> though it
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:53102:14"/>
may be ſuppoſed that one reaſon, which made him inſiſt
ſo vehemently on it, &amp; repeat this exhortation ſo frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
was, That he reflecting on his own temper, when he was
a Jewiſh Zealot, knew that it was a venom which might by
degrees creep even into a ſincere mind, and leaven and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
it under the colour of the being active in the cauſe of
Religion, and ſo transform a man, and an honeſt man too, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
an enraged fury, as himſelf was when under the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of thoſe ill principles; though what he did, was the
effect not of deſigned wickedneſs, but of Ignorance. St.
<hi>James</hi> writes in the ſame ſtrain againſt all furious Zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lots,
who were apt to boaſt of their zeal, and to face
down the truth with their impudence, and pretended to
great wiſdom for the juſtifying what they did. He tells
them,<note place="margin">James 3. 13, 14, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>that wiſdom was not from above, but was earthly,
ſenſual and Deviliſh:</hi> and that <hi>where bitter zeal and ſtrife
was, there was confuſion and every evil work; but the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
that was from above, was firſt pure, then peaceable, gentle
and eaſie to beintreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without
partiality, and without Hypocriſie; and that the fruits of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs
were ſown in peace, of them that made peace.</hi> St. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
keeps in the ſame path. He had formerly been under
the ſudden tranſports of ill tempered zeal, when he ſmote
with the Sword thoſe that came to ſeize on our Saviour,
which he ought not to have done, ſince they were
ſent out by thoſe who had a lawful authority; but it
then appeared in him, that the rages of indiſcreet heat do
not agree with that diſpoſition of mind ſo indiſpenſably
neceſſary to a Chriſtian, which is a readineſs to confeſs the
truth, though the danger in doing it were ever ſo appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent:
He therefore exhorts thoſe, to whom he wrote, to
<hi>lay aſide all malice and guile,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Pet. 2. 1.</note> 
               <hi>and Hypocriſies, envies and
evil ſpeakings; that they would be all of one mind, having
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:53102:14"/>
compaſſion one of another;</hi>

               <hi>that they would love as brethren,
be pitiful and courteous, not rendring evil for evil, nor rail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for railing, but contrariwiſe a bleſſing;</hi> and that <hi>above all
things they would have fervent charity among themſelves, which
would cover a multitude of ſins;</hi>

                  </gap>.</note> and he exhorts all to <hi>add to
their godlineſs, brotherly kindneſs and charity,</hi> as if godlineſs
could not be compleat without theſe. St. <hi>John</hi> in all his
Epiſtles ſeems to have had nothing more in his thoughts,
than to perſwade thoſe to whom he wrote to love one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
which he does with the higheſt and moſt earneſt Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortations
to it poſſible:<note place="margin">1 S Joh. 4. 15.</note> 
               <hi>God is love, and he that dwelleth
in love,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ch. 2. V. 10, 11.</note> 
               <hi>dwelleth in God, and God in him; he that loves his
brother, abideth in the light, and there is no occaſion of ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling;</hi>
he has a ſerene and calm mind, and is not hurried
unto violent Tranſports: Whereas <hi>he that hates his brother,
is in darkneſs, and walks in it, for it hath blinded his eyes;</hi>
it runs him on blindly to many Precipices, it carries him to
exceſſive Heats, and makes him act like a mad man: And
no wonder if it end in bloud and confuſion;<note place="margin">1 S. Joh. 3. 15.</note> 
               <hi>for he that hates
his brother is a murderer;</hi> he murders him in his wiſhes,
and will not fail to put theſe in execution upon the firſt op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity;
and to ſum up all,<note place="margin">Ch 3. v. 14.</note> 
               <hi>By this we know,</hi> ſays he,
<hi>that we have paſs'd from death to life,</hi> from the death of ſin
to the life of God,<note place="margin">Jude v. 19, 16.</note> 
               <hi>if we love the brethren.</hi> St. <hi>Jude</hi> gives
a Character of the Incendiaries that were then in the
Church, who did <hi>ſeparate themſelves,</hi> pretending to greater
ſanctity and ſtrictneſs, and yet <hi>were ſenſual, and had not the
Spirit,</hi> which appeared in theſe Inſtances, <hi>They were mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murers,
complainers, who ſpoke great ſwelling words, and had
mens perſons in admiration for advantage;</hi> that is, were gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to Canting, and did blindly follow their Leaders. But
as he exhorts the Chriſtians to <hi>contend earneſtly for the faith,</hi>
               <note place="margin">V. 3. v. 22, 23.</note>
ſo in relation even to thoſe groſly deluded and unruly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viders,
he charges them to have <hi>compaſſion of ſome,</hi> and to
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:53102:15"/>
endeavour to gain upon them in the mildeſt manner;
others whoſe tempers were rougher, were to be reſcued by
ſharper methods, like the <hi>pulling one out of the fire;</hi> and
theſe different methods were to be applied diſcreetly, as
the condition of the perſon might require it.</p>
            <p>And thus we ſee the Apoſtles in all their Epiſtles repeat
theſe Exhortations with ſo much earneſtneſs, that upon the
whole matter it muſt be concluded, either this is not the
Goſpel, or thoſe that differ ſo much from theſe Rules are
not true Goſpellers. I have enlarged on theſe things the
more fully, becauſe I muſt conclude, that if the Authority
of ſuch words does not prevail, it is a vain thing to go
about to perſwade any to theſe duties by other Topicks.
Nor were theſe only Leſſons given to Chriſtians as political
Precepts, in that Infancy and weakneſs of this Religion,
which as their numbers increaſed, and their power grew,
they might ſuperſede: But we clearly ſee the ancient Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
thought they were as much bound by them, after the
Emperors became Chriſtian, as they were before.</p>
            <p>When the laſt Perſecution ceaſed, and the Calm and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection
of <hi>Constantine</hi>'s Reign ſucceeded, the <hi>Christians,</hi>
tho' many of them carried ſtill the marks of the Cruelty of
their Perſecutions, in the loſs of their Eyes or Limbs, yet
endeavoured no Revenge on their Perſecutors, no not in
<hi>Egypt,</hi> where ſo many thouſands of them had ſuffered;
and the <hi>Heathens,</hi> for above an Age after that, continued
to be in the chief Imployments, both Civil and Military.
And tho' this had made it eaſier for the Empire again to
turn to <hi>Heatheniſm</hi> under <hi>Julian,</hi> yet upon his death no
Cruelties nor Violences were imployed; nor did they think
the Diſturbance given by <hi>Arius,</hi> and the ſmall Party he
then had, was to be proſecuted with a higher ſeverity than
Baniſhment. And tho' the <hi>Arians</hi> became cruel Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
when the Court was governed by their Councels, act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:53102:15"/>
more politically under <hi>Conſtantius,</hi> but violently under
<hi>Valens,</hi> yet the Orthodox, who had complained of thoſe
Severities, did not retaliate, when the Empire fell into
the hands of one that was ſo zealous for them as <hi>Theodoſius</hi>
was: and when <hi>Nazianzen</hi> ſaw ſome too much inclined to
it, in the beginnings of his Reign, how earneſtly did he
ſtudy to moderate their Heats and Reſentments? And tho'
the <hi>Donatists</hi> were after many renewed Hearings condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in <hi>Constantine</hi>'s time, in every one of them, yet the
Orthodox Party ſtudied ſtill to gain upon them, by the
ways of love and meekneſs, till at laſt they grew inſuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table,
and fell upon the others, and robbed and wounded
them, committing ſuch Outrages, that the Biſhops in <hi>Africk</hi>
were forced to implore the Emperor's protection for their
own ſafety; and yet the ſeverity went no higher than Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment,
or fining of the moſt outragious. And as St.
<hi>Austin</hi> was not eaſily brought to conſent even to ſo much,
ſo afterwards when the Governors were puniſhing the <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natiſts</hi>
for their Inſolences, he was always interpoſing to
mitigate the ſharpneſs of the Law, and the rigor of their
Proceedings. It is true, there were too great Heats in the
Church, even then in the management of their Debates,
yet till <hi>Damaſus</hi> begun that mad proſecution of the <hi>Luci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferians</hi>
at <hi>Rome,</hi> theſe were not carried to violent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees.</p>
            <p>But as the purity of the Chriſtian Religion grew corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and iniquity did abound, then did love wax cold, and
rage grew hot, till at laſt it flamed out in moſt terrible
Perſecutions, ſet on in the <hi>12th.</hi> Century againſt the <hi>Albi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genſes</hi>
at firſt. And that theſe might be managed with all
the advantages poſſible, for the deſtruction of poor Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cents,
new Courts were ſet up, and unheard of Methods
were found out, for facilitating Proceſſes, making a ſlight
proof ſerve, and forcing the Party to accuſe himſelf by
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:53102:16"/>
an Oath <hi>ex Officio;</hi> theſe Courts did alſo proceed upon
ſecret Information, without Indictments or Accuſers. In
a word: Forms of Procedure were invented, ſuch as even
Tyrants had not uſed for the Crimes of Treaſon; and all
this to deſtroy ſuch as could not ſubmit to every unreaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Doctrine, or ridiculous piece of Worſhip then ſet up.
And they were not only ſatisfied with the Cruelties then
practiſed, but they made Laws and Canons, (then eſteemed
more binding than Laws) by which all Princes were for ever
bound to extirpate Hereticks. And becauſe ſome might be
better natured than eaſily to become the Inquiſitors Hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
they were declared to have forfeited their Dominions,
if they ſhould be guilty of any lenity, which upon that fell
to the diſpoſal of the <hi>Pope.</hi> And leſt ſome good natured
Biſhops might be backward and ſlow in it, they were like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
bound by the Oath which they took at their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration,
to proſecute Hereticks to the utmoſt of their
power. So the Biſhops being thus ſworn to condemn them,
and Princes threatned with Depoſition if their Sentences
were not executed, it was ſcarce poſſible for theſe poor
men to eſcape.</p>
            <p>But we have not ſo learned Chriſt: We ſee clearly what
Rules the Goſpel gives in this Matter; we ought to love
one another as Brethren, and not to ſuffer our Zeal to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate
into Rage or Barbarity, but muſt ſtudy to gain up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
thoſe who differ from us in the ſpirit of meekneſs, by
which we may in time conquer their Miſtakes, and at leaſt
bring them to a greater temper, through the gentleneſs of
our deportment towards them, and incline them to have
better thoughts of us, and that may prove an effectual mean
to make them think the better of the Truth for our ſakes.
For the greateſt part mens Affections do inſenſibly govern
their Opinions, ſince few examine ſpeculative Points as
they lye before them, in the Arguments uſed about them,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:53102:16"/>
but conſider them in the lump, and generally judge of
them by ſome prejudices which incline them to like or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
ſuch a ſort of men.</p>
            <p>One thing is to be ſaid for Moderation, that it is the
conſtant Plea of the unfortunate: all People when de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed,
take Sanctuary in it, as a common place, upon
which it is eaſie to ſay many popular things. But alas,
how commonly is it forgotten by the very ſame Perſons
when the Wind and Tide turns? We hear even the <hi>Papists,</hi>
for all their Inquiſitions and Burnings, Plead for gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and favor, though in them it is ſcarce reconcileable to
common Modeſty. If there were nothing but opinion in
the caſe, if they had not ſuch a mixture of cruel Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
with a blind dependence on a Forrain Power, that
is bound by their own Rules, never to relent till Hereſie
is extirpated, and all Hereticks deſtroyed, I ſhould be
as earneſt to ſtir up Compaſſion for them as for others:
and as it is, I am ſure we ought to carry ſo towards
them, that it may appear we do not hate their Perſons,
and do nothing againſt them but as we are compelled
to it for ſelf-preſervation, and even in the hardeſt things
that a prudent care of our own quiet and ſafety may
force us to do, all perſonal ſoftneſs and gentleneſs to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
them, is indiſpenſably neceſſary to ſuch as would
ſhew themſelves to be truly Reformed Chriſtians.</p>
            <p>Others Plead now for Moderation, though they have
forgot it ſhamefully where they have Power, as the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations
do now in <hi>New-England,</hi> and the <hi>Presbytery</hi>
did in <hi>Scotland.</hi> The one impoſe under the pains of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment
and Death in caſe of return; not only the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
of their State, but many ſpeculative points of Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
and other things that are certainly indifferent. The
<hi>Presbytery</hi> in <hi>Scotland</hi> impoſed the Covenant under the
pains of Excommunication, upon which followed a For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiture
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:53102:17"/>
of the perſonal Eſtate, and a Sequeſtration of
the real Eſtate, and this all perſons Men and Women
were forced to Swear, though few could underſtand it;
and one particular was not far from an Inquiſition, that
every one ſhould diſcover all Malignants and Enemies
to their Cauſe,<note place="margin">4. Article.</note> in order to the bringing them to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dign
puniſhment, by which every man was Sworn to be
a Spy and an Informer. Theſe are ill Patterns, and as
we ought not to imitate them, ſo we muſt govern our
ſelves by very different methods, if we come under the
Diſcipline of the Goſpel.</p>
            <p n="4">4. And now I come to the laſt Particular, to make ſome
Application of all this to this time, and the occaſion you
are now met about. We are now brought under one of
the unhappieſt Circumſtances that a Nation or a City can
be in. There have ariſen amongſt us ſuch heats, ſo much
bitterneſs, ſo violent an Averſion to one another, that it
muſt needs beget great grief and ſad apprehenſions in all
that look on, and judge Impartially. Thoſe Animoſities,
which no wonder if, at the end of a long War, when
our Wounds were bleeding, and our Sores were tender,
did tranſport, eſpecially the unhappy but worthy Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferers
a little, and were by a happy revolution, and a
Gracious Oblivion, wiſely buried and ſeemed quite ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed,
are now breaking out again with a violence
almoſt as great as was during the War it ſelf: and though
we are ſtill in Peace, yet ſuch a temper appearing among
us, we have no reaſon to expect it ſhall continue long.
Tinder will catch fire from a ſpark. Theſe heats are kept
up by Libels and defamations, and all the methods that
can blow upon them to kindle the fire the faſter, and to
make it flame out the more vehemently: and what muſt
the end of theſe things be? All that we now feel is
but the beginning of ſorrows, if we are not ſo wiſe,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:53102:17"/>
as in time to know the things which belong to our
Peace.</p>
            <p>This were an unhappineſs much to be lamented at any
time: but what ſhall be ſaid, when we are as it were call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon from Heaven, by ſuch awak'ning Providences, to
lay down our Conteſts, and to unite, for the preſervation
of our Holy Religion? Sure none believe themſelves,
when they ſay, we are not in danger of Popery: and
none can think it but they who deſire it, and ſo appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
no danger in it; and if we come under the power
of that Religion, none but Fools can hope that they ſhall
eſcape the Severities they muſt fall under, if they do not
intend to change with the Tide, and even ſuch muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve
ſtill to be ſuſpected. Old Stories will be often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred.
What can reaſonably preſerve us from this,
or that ſtorm, which a mighty Potentate is ready to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
on ſome of his neighbors, but our joyning toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in mutual Unity and Brotherly love? <hi>England</hi> is a
Body ſo vaſt and ſtrong, that if it is united both in
Church and State, it cannot only defend it ſelf, but ſo
ſteadily hold the ballance, as to preſerve as well its
other Allies, as the Forraign Churches, ſome of which are
now expoſed to the rage of their Perſecutors, if we do
not continue diſ-joynted at home till, all falls into one
Scale.</p>
            <p>Upon this occaſion I cannot forbear to ſet before you
the deplorable State of our Perſecuted Brethren in <hi>France,</hi>
whom neither the ſecurity of Irrevocable Edicts, nor the
great Services done the Crown, and that not only in the
laſt Age, but during the preſent King's Reign in the Wars
of <hi>Paris,</hi> nor their peaceable ſubmiſſion and patience
amidſt all the oppreſſions they have groaned under for
ſeveral years, which has not provoked them to the leaſt
undutiful behaviour, nor their great numbers and induſtry,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:53102:18"/>
can preſerve from thoſe Cruelties they now ſuffer meerly
for their Religion; for their carriage has been ſuch, that
their Enemies have not a colour for their Proceedings but
that only. And now the laſt priviledge of the miſerable, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
to complain, is denied them. Thus we ſee what all
Promiſes, yea and Laws, backed with great merit, do ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie,
where that Religion once takes place.</p>
            <p>I muſt acknowledge, that among the many ſad Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomes
we are under, this is one good Sign, I am ſorry to
ſay it is almoſt the only good one, that God has raiſed up
in us ſuch a Spirit of Compaſſion for the poor Exiles, that
come and ſeek ſhelter here: that the King does ſo graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
receive and encourage them, and the People do ſo
bountifully relieve them: And among the other Glories
of this Great City, the largeneſs of your Charities, and the
tenderneſs of your Care on this Occaſion, will be added
to your Honour here on Earth, and to your Rewards
hereafter in Heaven; and I hope what you have already
given, is but the Earneſt of what you will do, if the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of thoſe that fly hither, continue to increaſe.</p>
            <p>But tho' your Charity on this Occaſion is a thing that
well becomes ſuch a Reformed Church, yet it is not all the
Uſe that we are to make of ſo ſad a Calamity. We know
not how ſoon we may be reduced to the like Straits, and
be brought under a Famine of the Word of the Lord, and
be expoſed to the fury of that bloudy Religion. Let us
therefore look up to God, that he may be merciful to us,
and may pour out on us a Spirit of Repentance, to turn
to him, and to forſake all our abominations, by which we
have ſo highly provoked him, and diſhonoured our holy
Profeſſion; and alſo a Spirit of Love and Charity, to unite
us one to another. I ſhall not adventure to offer at any thing
towards this, which belongs to the Government, or is to
be the Subject of publick Conſultations, but ſhall only ſay
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:53102:18"/>
this to private Perſons; If every one will endeavour to
diſpoſſeſs himſelf of Heat and Rancor, and will reſolve to
do all he can towards an Agreement; and if we all pray
earneſtly for it, there will be no ſuch difficulty in it as may
be imagined. Hatred ſtirreth up ſtrife, but Love covers a
multitude of ſins. If a better temper did poſſeſs us, we
would either find out Expedients to accommodate our
Differences; or if we could not agree them, yet we might
enjoy our Opinions, and ſtill love one another; and then
there would be no great danger in the continuance of ſome
different Speculations or Practices.</p>
            <p>But if we will ſtill look backwards, and be always re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecting
on every thing that may exaſperate more and more,
and will not look forwards to that Precipice of ruine that
is ſo near us, and to the only Mean that can ſave us from it;
I mean, a Reformation of our Manners, and a Compoſing
of our Heats: If Libelling, and the defaming one another;
if the ſpreading of Lyes and Scandals, with deſign to make
the breach wider, is ſtill continued and encouraged among
us, what is to be ſaid? This is of the Lord, and is a puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
for our other ſins, and the forerunner of moſt terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Judgments, which will come on us like an Armed man;
and then when it is too late for the Publick, we will be
all of us ready to accuſe our ſelves, and to condemn one
another. God avert this and make us wiſe in time.</p>
            <p>To conclude, I ſhall now propoſe a few things wherein
we ought above all things to ſtudy to be united among
our ſelves.</p>
            <p>In the firſt place, Let us joyn in calling upon God
earneſtly, and directing our aims chieſly to his Glory, for
the preſervation of that Holy Religion, which by his Grace
is ſetled amongſt us. Let us not, by our ill Lives, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke
him to deprive us of ſo great a Bleſſing, and let us
all reſolve to ſpend ſome portion of our time, at leaſt an
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:53102:19"/>
hour every Week, in earneſt Prayers to him for the Peace
of his <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> amongſt us, and for continuing our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
ſtill with us. It is his Cauſe, and we ought chiefly
to offer it up to him for his protection and defence: and
if our ſins do not defeat the deſign of our Prayers,
we may hope that a conſiderable number of ſuch Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors
will procure great Bleſſings to us, eſpecially we ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the aſſiſtance of the prayers of thoſe who have taken
ſanctuary among us; towards whom your bowels have
been ſo opened, that we know we have many prayers
put up by them which are ſet to our account.</p>
            <p>In the next place let us joyn together in all dutiful ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions
of ſincere loyalty to our King; in an obedience
to the Laws, and a reverent ſubmiſſion to his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
that our Enemies may not have the leaſt pretence
to ſay, that the zeal we expreſs for him, and our dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation
of their Conſpiracies, is only a diſguiſe to as bad
deſigns: let us go on in the wayes of ſubmiſſion and loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty,
and by theſe put to ſilence the ignorance of fooliſh
men. Let all Inſolent Libels and reproachful Diſcourſes
be held in deteſtation, and let us earneſtly pray to God,
the God of peace and love, to turn the hearts of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
to the Children, and of the Children to the Fathers,
and the Diſobedient to the wiſdom of the Juſt; and that
the happy day of an entire Settlement, and the burying
of all Fears and Jealouſies may come quickly, that ſo
one ſpirit may animate both the King and his Subjects,
and the Court and the Country. Let this be a part of
our daily prayers, and let every one do all in his power
towards it, and then we may hope to ſee again ſerene and
quiet times.</p>
            <p>Let us alſo conſider one another as brethren: Let us
bear with one anothers Infirmities: Let us give ſome al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowances
to the weakneſs of thoſe that are miſled, to the
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:53102:19"/>
force of Education, and the biaſs of vulgar prejudices.
Let us ſtudy to gain upon one another by gentleneſs and
meekneſs. Let us have the danger of Inquiſitions, Fires,
and forreign Conqueſt more in our thoughts, and not
contend ſtill about ſome leſs eſſential or important points.
Let not every triffling excuſe be ſought out to make or
keep up diviſions. Let not thoſe that differ from us think,
that becauſe of ſome hard things which they may meet
with, they are excuſed from all Reverence to their Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours,
or a diſpoſition to be reconciled to thoſe who
may have uſed them ill in their Opinion. Let us not ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravate
matters beyond meaſure, but judge of all things
with candour and charity. In a word, let us endeavour
if we can to be of one mind, and at leaſt to have one
heart, to love one another, and to keep the unity of the
ſpirit in the bond of peace.</p>
            <p>And in the laſt place, and in relation to our preſent
Aſſembling, I humbly exhort you to proceed to the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
you are now to make, with a ſpirit of love and
brotherly kindneſs, without faction or animoſity, clamour
and confuſion, that ſo in the Choice of this great Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate,
the Head of ſo great Body under the King, you
may agree in a man that fears God, that honours the King,
that may be an Example of a good Life, an Aſſertor of the
true eſtabliſhed Religion, a Maintainer of Juſtice, and a
Promoter of Peace and Order amongſt you. In which
let us all pray to God to bleſs and direct you, and to
make you ſtill carry in your minds theſe words of our
Saviour. <hi>Every Kingdom divided against it ſelf is brought
into deſolation, and every City or Houſe divided againſt it ſelf
ſhall not stand.</hi>
