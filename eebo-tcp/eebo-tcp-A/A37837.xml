            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>YOur Majesties most Loyall and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Subjects, the Lords and Commons in Parliament, have received Your Message of the 16. of this instant <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bruary,</hi> sent at the instance of the Queens Majesty. And upon consideration thereof, to our great joy and content, finde therein cleer expressions of Grace and Favour, from both Your Majesties for which we return our most humble thanks, and have here withall sent the Transcript of that Letter required by Your Majesty, as likewise of two other Letters directed to M. Secretary <hi>Nicho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las,</hi> and Sir <hi>Lewes Dives,</hi> all which were brought to us under one cover indorced to M. Secretary, with Information, that they were written by the Lord <hi>Digby</hi>; who being a person fled from the Justice of Parliament, and one who had given many evidences of the dis-affection to the publike good; we conceived it necessary to open the two former, and finding sundry expressions in them full of Asperitie and Malignitie to the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
<pb facs="tcp:64747:3"/>
We thought it very probable, That the like may be contained in that to Her Majesty; and that it would be dishonourable to Her Majesty, and dangerous for the Kingdom if it should not be opened, wherein we were no whit deceived as Your Majesty may well perceive by the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents thereof.</p>
            <p>And although we cannot but be very sensible of the great dishonour therein done to Your Majesties, and the malitious endeavours of fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting and encreasing the jealousie betwixt Your Majesty and Your people. Yet we are farre from reflecting any thing upon the Queen, or expecting any satisfaction from Her Majesty; But impute all to the bold and envenomed spirit of the man; Only we most earnestly beseech Your Majesty to perswade the Queen, that She will not vouchsafe any countenance to, or correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency with the Lord <hi>Digby</hi> or any other of the fugative or Traitors whose offences now depend under the examination and judgement of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which we assure our selves will be very effectuall to further the removall of all Jealousies and discontents betwixt Your Majesty and Your people, and the setling the great Affairs of Your Majesty, and the Kingdom, in an assured State and condition of Honour, safety, and prosperity.</p>

            <head>The Spanish Ambassadors Answer to the Message from a Committee of both Houses of Parliament.</head>
            <p>THe Lord Ambassador of <hi>Spain, Don Allanso de Cardenas</hi> having understood what the Lord <hi>Fielding,</hi> of the Lords House, and Sir <hi>Thomas Barrington</hi> Baronet, and Sir <hi>Iohn Holland</hi> Baronet of the House of Commons, All three Commissaries from the Parliament, have said in behalf of both Houses, concerning the advertisement given them, that in the Haven of <hi>Dunkerk</hi> there were certain Ships laded with Ammunition, ready to take sail, intended for the relief of the Rebels of <hi>Ireland,</hi> which they hold contrary to the Articles of Peace between the two Crowns. And that they required he should send to <hi>Dunkerk,</hi> and all other His Majesties Dominions, And that he should write unto the King His Master to make stay of those and all such Ships, as may cary supply of Powder, Victuals, Money, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ayde to His Majesties Subjects, that at this present are in Rebellion in <hi>Ireland</hi>; because other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
<pb facs="tcp:64747:4"/>
it would be understood to be a breach of the Treaties between the two Crowns, and so resented by the Parliament. The said Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassador of <hi>Spain</hi> answered, That besides the understanding, which he hath of the King His Masters minde and intention to conserve the friendship which he professeth with His Majesty of great <hi>Britain,</hi> he hath expresse and most parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular notice, that the Ships which are now in <hi>Dunkerk</hi> Haven laded with Souldiers and Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition and ready to sail, neither are for <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> nor were they provided for any such pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, And that this notice was given him by <hi>Don Francisco de Melo</hi> Earl of <hi>Assumar,</hi> Governour and Captain Generall of the States of <hi>Flaunders,</hi> whom the resident of His Majesty of great <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,</hi> that assists in <hi>Brussels,</hi> assured that he is fully satisfied of their not going for <hi>Ireland,</hi> as is also His King, who signified so much unto him in a Letter, in which he likewise commanded him to thank the said <hi>Don Francisco de Melo,</hi> for denying leave, which certain Irish serving in those States, had asked to return to their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, which he denyed; to avoide all suspition, Notwithstanding their end for asking it, was unknown. The same assurance did the same Ambassador give unto the Commissaries afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said
<pb facs="tcp:64747:4"/>
of the Parliament, concerning the mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Ships in <hi>Dunkerk</hi> laden with Ammunition, and Souldiers, that they are not for <hi>Ireland</hi>; And he profered to write to <hi>Dunkerk,</hi> and all other Parts of <hi>Flaunders</hi> and Dominions of the King His Master; and particularly to his Catholike Majesty, to the end, That the observance of the Articles of peace, which hitherto have been so religiously observed of the King His Masters part, and His Subjects may be continued; and that new and strait Orders be given, That no Subject of his Catholike Majesty, shall dare vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late them, sending any kinde of aydes to foster the insurrection in <hi>Ireland,</hi> under pain of the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment imposed upon the transgressors. And the said Ambassador to manifest the sincerity of his heart, profered to solicite it with the readiest and most forcible means that lay in his power, hoping (as in reason he should,) that his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty of great <hi>Britany,</hi> and the Parliament, will for their part punctually observe the same in the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foresaid conformity towards the Rebels of the King his Master, not permitting any kindes of succour or assistance in whatsoever quality to be afforded them, from these Kingdoms.
