         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Reader, of some certaine
things, for thy better un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
of this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise.
First, that whereas
thou shalt find here three
severall Characters, Thou wouldst take notice
that the <hi>Roman</hi> is the words of the Author;
the <hi>Itali<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>k,</hi> matter of Distinction, partly, but
principally of Quotation by him used; and that
the <hi>English</hi> letter doth exhibit to thee, the
words and periods of the Epistle, or Discourse
which is here confuted. Secondly, that how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
the Letter by him here replyed unto, be
scattered up and downe, and in divers hands;
Yet because possiblie, the Copie of the same hath
<pb facs="tcp:20504:3"/>
not hitherto been seene of all, who may chance
cast their eyes upon this Treatise; and partly,
that the world may see, that hee hath dealt tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
with the <hi>Epistoler,</hi> and not omitted any Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
or Autority by him produced; The
very Letter it selfe is herewith Printed, and
bound together with it, though it bee <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crypha.</hi>
Last of all, I must let thee know, that
whereas the <hi>Acts and Monuments,</hi> other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
called the <hi>Booke of Martyrs,</hi> being a
Booke which the <hi>Epistoler</hi> makes much use of,
is of a different Edition in the reply, from that
which is so often cited in the Letter; and that
there have beene many Editions of the same:
That which the Author deales in, is the last
Edition, Printed at <hi>LONDON</hi> in three
volumes, <hi>Anno</hi> 1631. I have no more to
say unto thee, but wish thee good luck in the
name of the Lord; And so adieu.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Have read your Letter, and
cannot but extreamely won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
that you should be so ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>silie
over-weighed as I see
you are. You say that you
were willing once, of your
owne accord, to have remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
your Cammunion Table
unto the East end of your <hi>Chancell,</hi> according as it
is in his Majesties <hi>Chappell,</hi> and generally in all
<hi>Collegiate</hi> and <hi>Cathedrall</hi> Churches: and that you
had intended so to doe, had you not mett with a
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:20504:4"/>
Discourse written in way of Letter, to the <hi>Vicar</hi>
of <hi>GR.</hi> (and as you have taken it upon common
report) by a Reverend Prelate of this Church;
whose Arguments have so prevailed with you,
that you are almost taken off from that resolution,
though it be now exacted of you by your <hi>Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie.</hi>
It seemes you are not rightly ballanced, when
you can be so easily induced to change your pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses;
especially as the Case now is, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
more of your obedience, than your Curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie.
And should wee all be so affected, as to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murre
on the Commands of our Superiours, in
matters of exterior Order, and publicke Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
till wee are satisfied in the Grounds and
Reasons of their Commandments; or should we
flie off from our duty, at sight of every new devise,
that is offered to us: we should soone find a spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
dissolution, both of Church and State. You
know, who said it, well enough, <hi>Si ubi jubeantur,
quaerere singulis liceat, pereunte obsequio imperium
etiam intercidit. Tacit. Hist. lib.</hi> 1. Yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
since you desire, that I would give you
satisfaction in the present point, by telling you
both what I thinke of the Discourse, which hath
so swayed you; and what may be replyed against
it, in maintenance of the Order now commended
unto you: I will adventure on the second, if you
will excuse me in the first. You say, and probably
believe so too, that it was written by a Reverend
Prelate, and indeed by some Passages therein it
may so bee thought; for it is written as from a
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:20504:4"/>
                  <hi>Diocesan,</hi> unto a private <hi>Parish Priest</hi> in his Jurisdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction:
and then, I hope, you cannot justly be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended,
if I forbeare to passe my censure upon my
betters. Yet so far I dare give you my opinion of it,
that I am confident it can bee none of his who is
pretended for the Author: nor indeed any ones
worthy to be advanced, I will not say unto so high
a dignity in the Church, but to so poore a Vicarige
as his was, to whom the Letter was first written.
Nay to speake freely to you, I should least thinke
it his, whom you entitle to it on uncertaine heare-sayes,
of all mens else: in that he hath beene ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
reported to bee of extraordinary parts in
poynt of learning, and of most sincere affections
unto the <hi>Orders</hi> of the Church; no shew or foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>step
of the which, or either of them, is to be found
in all that Letter. And I dare boldly say, that
when it comes unto his knowledge, what a poore
trifling peece of Worke, some men, the better to
indeere the Cause by so great a name, haue thus
pinned upon him: hee will not rest till hee have
traced this <hi>Fame</hi> to the first originall; and having
found the Authors of it, will conne them little
thankes for so great an injurie. For my part, I
should rather thinke, that it was writ by M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Cotton</hi>
of <hi>Boston,</hi> who meaning, one day, to take Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary
in <hi>New England,</hi> was willing to doe some great
Act before his going; that hee might be the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
welcome when hee came amongst them: or
by some other neighbouring <hi>Zelote,</hi> whose wishes

Order, to which the piety of these times is
so well inclined. Further than this, I shall not sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie
you in your first desire; but hope that you
will satisfie your selfe with this refusall.</p>
               <p>For the next part of your request, that I should
let you see (if at least I can) what may be said in
Answer unto that Discourse, which hath so sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainly
overswayed you; I shall therein endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
your satisfaction: though my <hi>Discretion</hi> for
so doing, may perhaps <hi>proove</hi> the second <hi>Holo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caust<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
that shall be sacrificed on those Altars,</hi>
which are there opposed. And this I shal the rather
do, because you say that the Discourse or Letter is
now much sought after, and applauded, and scatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
up and downe in severall Copies: of purpose,
as it were, to distract the people, and hinder that
good worke which is now in hand. In Answer to
the which, I shall keepe my selfe unto my patterne,
and to the businesse which is chiefly there insisted
on: grounding my selfe especially, on the selfe
same Authors and Autorities, which are there laid
downe; though not laid downe so truely, at least
not so cleerely, as they ought to bee. Nor had I
here said any thing touching the preamble there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto,
but fallen directly on the maine: but that,
me thinkes, I meet with somewhat, which seemes
to cast a scorne upon the <hi>Reverence</hi> appointed by
the <hi>Canon,</hi> unto the blessed name of IESUS; which
the <hi>Epistoler,</hi> whosoever he was, would have so

Herbe, according as the saying is, hath spoiled all
the Pottage. For when the Church commands,
that <hi>at the name of</hi> JESUS, <hi>due and lowly reverence
shall be done, by all Persons present, and this to testifie</hi>
(as the Canon saith) <hi>our inward humility:</hi> Why
should we thinke of any man who obeies the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non,</hi>
that he doth rather doe it out of <hi>Affectation,</hi>
than <hi>Affection?</hi> rather <hi>affectedly,</hi> then <hi>hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly,</hi>

The having of an <hi>Altar</hi> at the upper end of the

Lastly, The fixing of it in the Quire,
that so it may not bee removed into the body of
the Chuch: which things, the Vicar, as it seemes,
did both approve of, and desire, and was therein

rejected in the <hi>Homily,</hi> is that which is cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
downe in the Booke of <hi>Articles:</hi> which the
<hi>Epistoler</hi> had no reason to suspect, was ever thought
on, much lesse aymed at, by the Vicar of <hi>Gr.</hi>
though he desired to have an <hi>Altar,</hi> i. e. to have
the Communion Table placed <hi>Altar-wise,</hi> at the
upper end of his Quire, or used the name of <hi>Altar,</hi>
for the holy Table. For it is granted afterwards
by the <hi>Epistoler,</hi> that the <hi>Lords Table</hi> anciently
was called an <hi>Altar, because of the Sacrifice of
praise and thanksgiving:</hi> for which hee voucheth
<hi>Archbishop</hi> Cranmer, <hi>and others;</hi> and cites the

700. of my Edition.</p>
               <p>2 AS for the <hi>Canons of the Convocation,</hi> Anno
1571. out of which is alleged, that <hi>not
the Uicar, but the Church wardens are to
provide for the Communion; and that not
an Altar, but a faire ioyned Table:</hi> its plaine
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:20504:8"/>
they tell us no s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ch matter, or not so much unto
his purpose, as he would perswade us. All that
those Canons say, is this, and that in plaine affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mative
termes, without those Negations; <hi>Aeditui
curabuntmensam ex asseribus composite junctam, quae
administrationi sacro sanct ae Communionis inserviat;
&amp; mundum tapetem qui illam contegat:</hi>
                  <q>that the
<hi>Church-wardens</hi> shall provide a decent joyned Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
for the Communion, and see that it be orderly
covered with an handsome Carpet.</q>
And there
was reason why this Care (for so much as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
the providing of these things) should be
imposed on the <hi>Church-wardens,</hi> rather than upon
the <hi>Minister; viz.</hi> because the Table and the
Carpet both, were to be fitted and provided at
the Charge of the Parish. But the said <hi>Canons</hi>
doe not tell us, that the <hi>Church-wardens</hi> shall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
this Table, exclusively of the <hi>Vicar,</hi> without
his counsell; or that they shall appoint either of
what fashion it shall be, or whether it shall stand
in the <hi>body</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> or in the <hi>Chancell:</hi> or
whether in the <hi>Chancell,</hi> it shall be placed at the
upper end, like an <hi>Altar;</hi> or in the middle, like a
<hi>Table.</hi> For any thing those <hi>Canons</hi> tell us, the <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>car</hi>
was to have a greater hand in ordering the said
Table, being so provided, then the <hi>Church-war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens</hi>
were, or ought to have: as one that better
understood what was convenient in, and for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ods
service, than they did or could. Nor did the <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>car</hi>
any thing in this case against the Ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>on, for
hee provided not the Table; nor caused any <hi>Altar</hi>
                  <pb n="11" facs="tcp:20504:8"/>
to be built of new; but only caused the Table, which
he found provided by the <hi>Church-wardens,</hi> to be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
of to a more convenient place, than before it
stood in: so that the Allegation was as needlesse, as
the reprehension without ground. Onely it pleaseth
the <hi>Epistoler,</hi> to give some countenance to the <hi>Vestry-doctrine</hi>
of these dayes; in which the <hi>Churchwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens,</hi>
and other <hi>Elders</hi> of the <hi>Vestry,</hi> would gladly
challenge to themselves the Supreame disposing of
all Ecclesiasticall matters in their severall Parishes:
leaving their Minister, (in Townes Corporate especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally,)
to his Meditations; as if he only were intended
for a looker on, a dull Spectator of their active under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings.</p>
               <p>3 FOr, besides what is here ascribed to the <hi>Church
wardens,</hi> and denyed the <hi>Vicar,</hi> or Incumbent;
it followeth in the next place, save one, that <hi>Uicars
were never enabled to set up Altars, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed

<hi>to pull them downe.</hi> Injunct. 1<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Eliz. <hi>for Tables

Minister in that <hi>Injunction,</hi> is the principall man, and

not by the <hi>Church wardens,</hi> as the principall men, but
by the <hi>Curate</hi> chiefly, and any one of the <hi>Churchwar|
dens,</hi> whom he pleased to chuse.  It's true indeed, the
Bishop of the <hi>Diocesse</hi> is he to whom the ordering of
these things doth of right belong; and in the preface
to the Common Prayer Book it is so appointed. For
in the said Preface it i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> said, that <hi>for as much as nothing
almost can be so plainely set forth but doubts may arise
in the vse and practise of the same: to appease all such
diversities, (if any arise) and for the resolution of all
doubts concerning the manner how to understand, doe,
and execute the things contained in this Booke,
the Parties that so doubt shall alwaies resort unto the Bishop of
the Diocesse, &amp;c.</hi> But then, it is as true, or at least, more
fit, that he should send his resolutions to the Priest,

                  </hi> as it

and tables placed for the administration of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Sacrament, &amp;c.</hi> Sundry and many is not <hi>all</hi> nor

which followes, not only that <hi>in other places, the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars
were not taken downe upon opinion of some further
Order to be taken in it by the</hi> Queenes <hi>Commissioners;</hi>
but it is ordered, <hi>That no Altar shall bee taken downe,
without the oversight of the Curat, &amp; one of the Church

and caution, as before is said. Nay the <hi>Commissioners</hi>
were contented well enough, that the <hi>Altars</hi> former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

doth appeare by the said <hi>Injunction,</hi> that the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<hi>Queenes Commissioners,</hi> as they had good autority
for what they did; so wee may warrantably thinke,
that they were men of speciall note, and able judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
And therefore if they were <hi>contented,</hi> that
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:20504:10"/>
the <hi>Altars</hi> formerly erected should continue <hi>stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,</hi>
(as the <hi>Epistoler</hi> confesseth;) it is a good Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
that in the first project of the <hi>Reformation,</hi>
neither the <hi>Queene</hi> nor her <hi>Commissioners disallowed</hi>
of <hi>Altars,</hi> or thought them any way unserviceable
in a Church Reformed. So that for ought appeares
unto the contrary, neither the <hi>Article,</hi> nor the <hi>Homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi>
nor the <hi>Queenes Injunctions,</hi> nor the <hi>Canons</hi> of
1571. have determined any thing: but that as the
<hi>Lords Supper</hi> may be called a <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> so may the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>Table</hi> be called an <hi>Altar;</hi> and consequently, set up
in the place, where the <hi>Altar</hi> stood.</p>
               <p>5 Now as there is alleged no Canon, Ordinance,
or Doctrine, which if examined rightly, doe
declare against it; so there is much that may be said
in defence therof: and of that much we will use no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
but that which will agree with the capacitie of
the meanest man, and shall be proved by that autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie,
which the <hi>Epistoler</hi> trusts to most; in all this bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesse,
even the <hi>Acts</hi> and <hi>Monuments.</hi> To which we
shall adjoyne, for our more assurance, the Testimony
of two <hi>Acts</hi> of <hi>Parliament;</hi> one under King <hi>Edward</hi>
the sixth, th'other under Queene <hi>Elizabeth.</hi> First, for
the <hi>Acts</hi> and <hi>Monuments,</hi> we find, that not a few of
those which suffered death for their opposing of the
grosse &amp; carnall Doctrine of <hi>Transubstantiation,</hi> did
not only well enough endure the name of <hi>Altar,</hi> but

<hi>As concerning th'other six Sacraments, I make you the
same Answer, that I have done unto the Sacrament
of the Altar, and no other,</hi> pag. 401. And in another
place, CHRIST <hi>being offered up once for all, in his
owne proper person, is yet sayd to bee offered up not onely
every yeare at</hi> Easter, <hi>but also every day in the celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the</hi> Sacrament; <hi>because his</hi> Oblation <hi>once for
ever made, is thereby represented,</hi> pa. 435. Archbishop
<hi>Cranmer</hi> also, though he opposed the <hi>Statute</hi> of the
<hi>Six Articles,</hi> particularly that of <hi>Transubstantiation,</hi>
which hee throughly canvast: yet at the phrase or
terme of <hi>Sacrament of the Altar,</hi> hee tooke no of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
but useth it as formerly had been accusto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
<hi>pag.</hi> 443.</p>
               <p>6. NOr was it a new name taken up of late, but
such as some of them acknowledge to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived
from pure Antiquity; &amp; those too, such as liv'd
and suffered, after the name of Altar had bin left out
of the Booke of <hi>Common Prayer,</hi> which was last e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablished.
<hi>Iohn Philpott</hi> thus, That <hi>partly because it is
a Sacrament of that lively</hi> Sacrifice, <hi>which</hi> CHRIST
<hi>offered for our sins upon the</hi> Altar <hi>of the Crosse; and
partly because that Christs body crucified for us, was
that bloody Sacrifice, which the blood-shedding of all the
beasts offered upon the</hi> Altar <hi>in the old Law did prefigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate,
&amp; signifie unto us: the old Writers doe sometimes
call the Sacrament of the Body and Blood of</hi> CHRIST,

                  <hi>amongst other names which they ascribe thereunto, the
Sacrament of the</hi> Altar, Part. 3. pag. 23. Thus Bishop
<hi>Latimer</hi> plainely granteth, that <hi>the Lords Table may
be called an</hi> Alt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>r, <hi>and that the Doctors call it so in
many places, though there be no propitiatory Sacrifice,
but onely</hi> CHRIST, pag. 85. And lastly, Bishop <hi>Ridley</hi>
do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

thus, that <hi>in the</hi> Sacrament of the Altar, <hi>is
the naturall body and blood of</hi> CHRIST, &amp;c. pag. 492.
But in reply unto an Argument of the Bishop of <hi>Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colnes,</hi>
taken out of <hi>Cyrill,</hi> doth resolve it thus, That
<hi>the Word</hi> ALTARE, <hi>in the Scripture, signifieth as well
the</hi> Altar <hi>whereupon the Iewes were wont to offer their
burnt Sacrifices, as the</hi> Table <hi>of the</hi> Lords Supper:
<hi>And that</hi> S. Cyrill <hi>meaneth by this word</hi> ALTARE,
<hi>not the</hi> Iewish Altar, <hi>but the</hi> Table <hi>of the</hi> Lord: <hi>and
by that saying,</hi> Altars <hi>are erected in</hi> Christs <hi>name,</hi>
Ergo, CHRIST <hi>is come; hee meanes, that the</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
<hi>is administred in his remembrance<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Ergo,</hi>
CHRIST <hi>is come,</hi> pag. 497. Which being the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
of the <hi>Prelates,</hi> and other learned men then
living, it is no marvell, if in the Parliament, 1. <hi>Edw.
6. cap.</hi> 1. the same name occurre. The Parliaments
in matters which concerned Gods Service, did then
use to speake, according as the Church had taught
them. Now in that Parliament, however it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved,
that the whole Communion should be resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
which in effect, was a plaine abolition of the
former Masse; yet is that Act which so restores it,
entituled, <hi>An Act against such persons as shall speake
irreverently, against the Sacrament of the Body and

I conceive it to bee the most decent scituation
when it is not used, and for use too, where the

<hi>that it should stand along close by the

This I have laid together, as being but a Preamble to

meant the setting of it in that place where the <hi>Altar</hi>

                  </hi> to be said

where it is said, that if by <hi>Altarwise</hi> is meant, that it

4. NOr doth it helpe the cause undertaken
by the <hi>Epistoler,</hi> that <hi>The Minister
appointed to reade the Communion, is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
to reade the Commandements, not at
the end, but at the Northside of the Table:</hi>
there being no difference in this case betweene the
<hi>North-end,</hi> and the <hi>North-side,</hi> which come both to
one. For in all quadrilaterall, and quadrangular fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures,
whether they bee a perfect Square, which
<hi>Geometricians</hi> call <hi>Quadratum,</hi> or a long Square (as
commonly our Communion Tables are) which they
call <hi>Oblongum:</hi> it's plaine that if wee speake accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the rules of Art, (as certainly they did which
composed that <hi>Rubricke</hi>) every part of it is a side;
how ever Custome hath prevailed to call the nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rower
sides by the name of ends. When therefore
hee that ministreth at the <hi>Altar,</hi> stands at the <hi>North-end</hi>
of the same, as wee use to call it; hee stands no
question at the <hi>North-side</hi> thereof, as in proprietie of
speech wee ought to call it; and so implies not, as it
is supposed by the <hi>Epistoler,</hi> that the end, or nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rower
part thereof, <hi>is to bee placed towards the East
great Window.</hi> And this Interpretation of the <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick,</hi>
I the rather stand to, because that in the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Prayer</hi> booke done into <hi>Latine</hi> by command, and

it over; as not conducing to this purpose;
but that it seemes to cast a scorne on them, by whose
direction the <hi>Booke of the Fast,</hi> in 1<hi rend="sup">•</hi>. of the King was
drawne up and published, as if it were a Noveltie or
singular devise of theirs, to call the latter part of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Service, by the name of <hi>Second Service:</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
indeed the name is very proper for it, and every
way agreeable both to the practise of antiquitie, and
the intentions of this Church at that very time, when
the Booke of Common Prayer was first established.
For if we looke into the Liturgie of our Church, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
after <hi>Athanasius Creed,</hi> wee shall find it
thus: <hi>Thus endeth the Order of Morning and Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning

6. THat which next followes, is a Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
onely of what went before:
Viz. that <hi>The Ministers standing at the
North side of the Table, was no new di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
in the Queenes time onely, but pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctised
in King</hi> Edwards <hi>reigne;</hi> that <hi>in the plot

that <hi>in</hi> King Edwards <hi>Liturgies, the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
standing in the middest of the Altar,</hi> (i. e.
with his back turned towards the people) 1549,
<hi>is turned into his standing at the Northside
of the Table,</hi> 1552. And finally, that <hi>this last
Liturgy was revived by Parl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ament,</hi> 1<hi rend="sup">•</hi>. Eliz.
This wee acknowledge to be true, but it addes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to the reasons produced before: and so per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
it is as true, that <hi>it was used so,</hi> when this
Letter was written, <hi>in most places of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi>
which in this kind had too much deviated
from the ancient practise. But where it followeth in
the next place, that <hi>What is done in Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pels,
or Cathedrall Churches, is not the
poynt in question, but how the Tables are
appoynted to be placed in Parish Churches:</hi>
I thinke that therein the <hi>Epistoler</hi> hath been much
mistaken. For certainly the ancient Orders of the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:20504:16"/>
Church of <hi>England,</hi> have beene best preserved in
the <hi>Chappells</hi> of the Kings Majestie, and the <hi>Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dralls</hi>
of this Kingdome; without the which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps,
wee had before this beene at a losse amongst
our selves, for the whole forme and fashion of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Service. And therefore if it bee so in the <hi>Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pells</hi>
and <hi>Cathedrall</hi> Churches, as the <hi>Epistoler</hi> doth
acknowledge; it is a pregnant Argument, that so
it ought to bee in the <hi>Parochiall;</hi> which heerein
ought to president and conforme themselves, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Patterne of the <hi>Mother</hi> Churches.
And I would faine learne of this doughtie Dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant,
why hee should make such difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
the <hi>Chappells,</hi> and <hi>Cathedrall</hi> Churches on
the one side, and the <hi>Parochialls</hi> on the other: as if
some things which were not warranted by Law,
were used in the one; and such as are allowed by
Law, were not permitted to the other. The <hi>Lawes</hi>
and <hi>Canons</hi> now in force, looke alike on all. And
therefore heere must bee some cunning, to make
the <hi>Chappells</hi> and <hi>Cathedralls</hi> guiltie of some <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

transgression, some breach of Law and publick Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der;
the better to expose them to the censure of a
race of men, who like them ill enough already.</p>
               <p>7. AS for that fancie which comes next,
that <hi>In some Chappells and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thedralls,
the</hi> Altars <hi>may bee still standing or
to make use of their Covers and Ornaments,
Tables may bee placed in their roome, of the

of the <hi>Cathedrall Churches<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> have hitherto been so
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

they have been able to provide themselves of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
Ornaments, without being any way behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to their former <hi>Altars.</hi> However, if it were
lawfull in <hi>Cathedrall Churches,</hi> either to suffer the
old <hi>Altars</hi> to continue standing, or to set up Tables
in their places, of the same length and fashion that
the <hi>Altars</hi> were of, onely in poynt of thrift, to save
greater charges: I hope it will bee thought more
lawfull, by indifferent men, to place the Table <hi>Altar-wise,</hi>
in <hi>Parochiall</hi> Churches, in poynt of decencie,
and due obedience unto publike Order That <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars</hi>
doe <hi>stand still in the</hi> Lutheran <hi>Churches,</hi>
(the Doctours and Divines whereof hee doth ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
afterwards to bee <hi>sound Protestants</hi>)
by the <hi>Epistoler</hi> is confessed, though it makes against
him: as also that the <hi>Apology for the</hi> Augustan
<hi>Confession doth allow it.</hi> And he confesseth too,
not onely that <hi>they stood a yeare or two in King</hi>
Edwards <hi>time, as may appeare by the Liturgy
printed 1549. but that the Queenes Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioners
were content they should stand,</hi> as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we noted. What, stood they but a yeare or two
in King <hi>Edwards</hi> time? Yes certainely they stood
foure yeares at the least, in that Princes reigne. For
in the first yeare of King <hi>Edward,</hi> being 1547. was
passed, that Statute, entituled, <hi>An Act against such
persons as shall speake ireverently of the Sacrament of

the Altar.</hi> Anno 1548. The Common prayer Book
was confirmed by Parliament, although not publi|
shed till the next yeare; wherein the word <hi>Altar</hi> is
oft used, and by the which it seemes the <hi>Altars</hi> did
continue as before there were. <hi>Anno.</hi> 1540, A Let|

Monum. Part. 2. p. 662. And in the yeare 1550.
which was the fourth yeare of his reigne, came out
an Order from the Councell, unto Bishop <hi>Ridley,</hi>
for taking downe the <hi>Altars</hi> in his Diocesse, <hi>Pag.</hi>
699. So long it seemes they stood without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction;
and longer might have stood perhaps,
if <hi>Calvin</hi> had given way unto it; of which more
heereafter.</p>
               <p>8. IN the meane time; from matter of Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
and Authoritie, wee must proceed
next unto poynt of Reason, and then goe on againe
unto matter of Fact; as the way is lead by the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistoler,</hi>
whom we must follow step by step in all his
wandrings. And in this way hee tells us. That <hi>the
Sacrifice of the Altar beeing abolished, these
(call them what <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> so alleaged, that the <hi>Sacrifice</hi> of the <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar</hi>
was abolished? I believe it not. It was allea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:20504:18"/>
indeed, <hi>That the forme of an</hi> Altar <hi>was ordained
for the</hi> Sacrifices <hi>of the</hi> Law; <hi>that both the</hi> Law, <hi>and
the</hi> Sacrifices <hi>thereof doe cease, and therefore that
the forme of the</hi> Altar <hi>ought to cease also. Act<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> and <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents</hi>
part. 2. <hi>pag.</hi> 700. The <hi>Sacrifice</hi> of the <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar,</hi>
and the <hi>Sacrifices</hi> of the <hi>Law,</hi> are two different
things: it being told us by Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> that <hi>wee</hi> (the
Christians) <hi>have an</hi> Altar, <hi>whereof they have no right
to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

That <hi>Altar,</hi> and that <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> must continue alwaies.
And were it granted, as it need not, that since the
<hi>Law,</hi> and <hi>Sacrifices</hi> thereof be both abolished, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the forme of the <hi>Altar</hi> is to be abolished: yet
would this rather helpe, than hurt us. For the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
Table standing in the <hi>Body</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> or
<hi>Chancell,</hi> hath indeed more resemblance to <hi>Altars,</hi>
on which the Priests did offer either <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> or <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence,</hi>
under the Law; then if it did stand <hi>Altarwise,</hi>
close along the wall, as did the <hi>Altars,</hi> after in the
<hi>Christian</hi> Church: the one of them, which was that

in the outward part of the Temple, and not within
the <hi>Sanctum Sanctorum,</hi> as our <hi>Altars</hi> doe.</p>
               <p>9. THat the said <hi>Tables of stone, or timber</hi> (though
placed <hi>Altarwise,</hi> for so I take it is his mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning)
<hi>may be well used in Kings and Bishops
houses where there are no people so voyd of
understanding, as to be scandalized,</hi> wee are
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:20504:18"/>
glad to heare of: and if it be not true, would to God
it were. However wee may safely say, that a small
measure of <hi>understanding,</hi> is in this kind sufficient to
avoid offence: there being none so weak of wit, who
may not easily bee perswaded (if at least they will,
or that their Leaders will permit them) that the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
of Gods <hi>Table,</hi> rather to one place than ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
it is not considerable in it selfe, or otherwise
materiall in his publick worship, further than it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth
unto <hi>Order</hi> and <hi>Vniformitie.</hi> If any bee so
<hi>void of understanding,</hi> which wee hardly thinke, and
plead their weaknesse in this point, as did the <hi>Brethren</hi>
in the <hi>Conference at Hampton Court;</hi> wee aske them
with his Majestie of happy memory, not <hi>whether 45
yeares,</hi> but whether 80 yeares <hi>be not sufficient for

very well be thought that it is not any want of <hi>under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,</hi>

<hi>all Dioceses did agree upon receiving Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,

was not about the having of a Table, wherein

               <p>12. VVHere it is next said, that <hi>we have no</hi>

wee have an</hi> Altar <hi>in regard of Participation
&amp; Communion granted to us:</hi> Were it no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

than it is here said, yet here we are all allowed
an <hi>Altar,</hi> in regard of <hi>Participation</hi> and <hi>Communion;</hi>
which is enough to justifie both the scituation of the
Table <hi>Altarwise,</hi> and the name of <hi>Altar,</hi> and that too
in the very instant of receiving the Communion.
Now for the proofe that wee have an <hi>Altar</hi> also in
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:20504:20"/>
regard of <hi>Oblation,</hi> wee need looke no further than
into the latter end of this second Paragraph; where
howsoever the <hi>Epistoler</hi> doth suppose, that <hi>the
name of Altar crept</hi> (hee might aswell have said,
it came) <hi>into the Church, in a kind of comply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in Phrase with the people of the Iewes,
as</hi> Chemnitius, Gerardus, <hi>and other sound Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants
were of opinion;</hi> (where by the way, we
may perceive that some may bee <hi>sound Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants,</hi>
though they like of Altars:) Yet he acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth
withall, that it was so called, partly, <hi>in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
of those Oblations made upon the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
Table, for the use of the Priest and
the Poore, whereof we reade in</hi> Justine Martyr,
Irenaeus, Tertullian, <hi>and other ancient Writers;</hi>
and partly, <hi>because of the Sacrifice of praise
and thanks-giving, as Arch-bishop</hi> Cranmer,
<hi>and others thought,</hi> Acts &amp; Monum. <hi>pag.</hi> 1211.
which is <hi>Part 2. pag.</hi> 700. of my Edition. Whereby
it seemes, that besides the complying in Phrase with
the <hi>Iews</hi> (which the <hi>Christians</hi> of the Primitive times
had little care of, when there was not greater reason
to perswade them to it:) the Communion Table,
was called an <hi>Altar,</hi> both in regard of the <hi>Oblations</hi>
there made to God, for the use of his <hi>Priests,</hi> and of
his <hi>Poore;</hi> as also, of the <hi>Sacrifice</hi> of <hi>Praise and Thanks-giving,</hi>
which was there offred to him by the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation.
And therefore, as before wee found an
<hi>Altar,</hi> in regard of <hi>Participation,</hi> and <hi>Communion;</hi>
so heere wee have an <hi>Altar</hi> in respect of <hi>Oblation</hi>
also.</p>

13. THis, though it be so cleere a Truth, that
the <hi>Epistoler</hi> could not deny it; yet puls
hee downe with one hand, what hee was after for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to set up with the other. For so it followeth in
the Letter: <hi>The use of an</hi> Altar <hi>is to Sacrifice
upon, and the use of a Table is to eate upon:
And because Communion is an action most
proper for a Table, as an Oblation is for an
Altar;</hi> what then? <hi>therefore the Church in her
Liturgy and Canons calling the same a Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

Principles. But if the Principles be true, as indeed
they are not, there being an <hi>Altar</hi> in the <hi>Temple,</hi>
which was not made to <hi>Sacrifice</hi> upon, as the <hi>Altar</hi>
of <hi>Incense;</hi> and a <hi>T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

soone follow on it; which is, that men would thinke
it necessary to <hi>sit</hi> at the <hi>Communion.</hi> For if <hi>Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion</hi>
be an action most proper for a <hi>Table,</hi> as it is af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed,
and that the use of a <hi>Table</hi> to be <hi>Eate</hi> upon,
as is also said: the inference will be very strong,
that therefore wee are bound to <hi>sit at the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,</hi>
even as wee doe at Common <hi>Tables,</hi> which
wee eate upon. A thing much sought for by some
men, as if not onely a great part of their Christian
liberty, but that their whole Religion did consist
therein; but brought into the Churches first, by the

               <p>14. WEe are now come unto the Story of
the Change, the change of <hi>Altars</hi>
into <hi>Tables,</hi> and the reasons of it, which is thus deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered:
<hi>In King</hi> Edwards <hi>Liturgy of 1549,
it is every where; but in that of 1552, it is no
where called an Altar, but the Lords Boord.
Why? Because the people being scandalized
heerewith in Countrey Churches, first beats
them downe</hi> de facto, <hi>then the supreame Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate
by a kind of Law, puts them downe</hi>
de jure; <hi>and setting Tables in their roomes,
tooke from vs the Children of the Church
and Common-wealth, both the name and
nature of former Altars.</hi> What ever may be said
of the change in the <hi>Publicke Liturgie,</hi> the reason
here assigned for taking downe of <hi>Altars,</hi> is both
false and dangerous. Nor is it altogether true, that
in the <hi>Liturgies</hi> here remembred, the name of <hi>Altar</hi>
is used onely in the one; though true it be, that that
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:20504:21"/>
of the <hi>L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Though the <hi>Epistoler</hi> had not, perhaps, the lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>su<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

called <hi>Gods boord,</hi> and once his <hi>Table,</hi> as <hi>viz.</hi> in the
Praier: <hi>We doe not presume, &amp;c.</hi> and in the <hi>Rubricke</hi>
of the same: yet he could not be ignorant that it was
so observed in his owne Author, the <hi>Acts</hi> and <hi>Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;</hi>
and in the Page by him often quoted. Where
it is said, that <q>The Booke of Common Prayer cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
the thing whereupon the <hi>Lord</hi>'s <hi>Supper</hi> is mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistred,
indifferently, a <hi>Table,</hi> an <hi>Altar,</hi> or the
<hi>Lord</hi>'s <hi>Board,</hi> without prescription of any forme
thereof either of a <hi>Table,</hi> or of an <hi>Altar;</hi> so that
whether the <hi>Lord</hi>'s <hi>Board</hi> have the forme of an <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar,</hi>
or of a <hi>Table,</hi> the Booke of Common Prayer
calleth it both an <hi>Altar</hi> and a <hi>Table.</hi> For as it cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
it an <hi>Altar,</hi> whereupon the <hi>Lord</hi>'s <hi>Supper</hi> is mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistred,
a <hi>Table,</hi> and the <hi>Lord's board:</hi> so it calleth
the <hi>Table,</hi> whereon the holy Communion is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stributed
with Lauds and Thanksgivings unto the
Lord, an <hi>Altar:</hi> For that there is offered the
same Sacrifice of Praise and Thanksgiving. <bibl>Part. 2.
pag. 700.</bibl>
                  </q> And this I have he rather laid downe at
large, to shew with what indifferencie these names
of <hi>Table, Board,</hi> and <hi>Altar,</hi> have beene used before;
and may be used for the present: as also in what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
the <hi>Lord</hi>'s <hi>Table</hi> may be called an <hi>

this according unto Master <hi>Foxes</hi> Marginall note, in
the selfe same Page; viz. <hi>The Table how it may be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
an</hi> Altar, <hi>and in what respect:</hi> which shewes that he
allowed it to be called an <hi>Altar,</hi> though this <hi>Epistoler</hi>
doth not like it.</p>

Command; yea, and a matter of Permission onely
in such times and places, where otherwise the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister
cannot conveniently bee heard of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municants.
So that in all the lesser Churches, such
as our Countrey Churches for the most part are,
and in all others where the Minister standing at the
<hi>Altar,</hi> may be heard conveniently: the Table may
stand <hi>Altar-wise</hi> in the time of ministration, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

<hi>The table set here in the middest,</hi> as it is tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slated,
but <hi>The table which is heere before you:</hi> Accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

bring a thing precisely into the middle, but to bring
it to us, or before us. As for that passage from <hi>Duran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus,</hi>
where it is said, that he examining the cause, why

                  </gap>ds
this reason for it, <hi>In medio Ecclesiae aperui os meum:</hi>
that proves not that the <hi>Altar</hi> stood in the middest of
the Church, but that the <hi>Priests</hi> stood at the middest
of the <hi>Altar.</hi> It is well known, that many hundred
yeares before hee was borne, the <hi>Altars</hi> generally
stood in the Christian Churches, even as now they
doe.</p>
               <p>6 NOw that wee may aswell say somewhat in
maintenance of the <hi>Altars</hi> standing in the East
part of the Church; as wee have answered those au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torities
which were produced by the <hi>Epistoler,</hi> for
planting of it in the middlest wee will alleage one
testimonie, and no more but one, but such a one as
shall give very good assurance of that generall usage,
and in briefe is this: <hi>Socrates</hi> in his Ecclesiasticall Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storie,
<hi>lib. 5. c.</hi> 21. speaking of the different customes
in the Christian Church, saith of the Church of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch,</hi>
the chiefe Citty of <hi>Syria,</hi> that it was built in dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
manner from all other Churches. How so?

<pb n="57" facs="tcp:20504:31"/>
the <hi>Altar</hi> was not placed to the <hi>East-ward,</hi> but
to the Westward. <hi>Nicephorus,</hi> Hist. <hi>lib. 12. cap.</hi> 24.
observes it generally of all the <hi>Altars</hi> in that Citty,
and note's withall, that they were situate in a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
manner from all other <hi>Altars.</hi> And howsoever
possibly in some other places which they knew not
of, the <hi>Altars</hi> might stand <hi>West-ward,</hi> as they did in
<hi>Antioch,</hi> or to some other point of heaven, as the
North, or South, if any stood so: yet it is manifest by
this, that in the generall practise of the Church, the
<hi>Altars</hi> used to stand to the <hi>Eastward</hi> onely. So that
for ought appeares unto the contrary in this <hi>Epistle,</hi>
the <hi>Vicar</hi> of <hi>Gr.</hi> might very safely hold his three
Conclusions, at the first remembred. First, that an
<hi>Altar</hi> may be used in the <hi>Christian Church;</hi> Secondly,
that the <hi>Table</hi> may stand <hi>Altar-wise,</hi> the Minister of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiating
at the <hi>North-end</hi> thereof; And thirdly, that
the <hi>Table</hi> may stand constantly in the upper part of
the <hi>Chancell,</hi> close along the wall, not to bee taken
downe, either in the <hi>First,</hi> or <hi>Second Service,</hi> especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally,

of mine I had concluded this reply, had I not
found this <hi>Item</hi> given unto the <hi>Vicar</hi> in the close of
all, that <hi>by that time hee had gained more expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
in the cure of Soules, he should find no
such Ceremony, as Christian Charity.</hi> Where if
his meaning be, that <hi>Christian Charity</hi> is in it selfe
more precious than any <hi>Ceremony,</hi> no doubt it will
be easily grante<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>7. I Have now ended with the Letter, and for
your further satisfaction will lay downe
somewhat, touching the ground or reason of the
thing required: not in it selfe, for that is touched
upon before, but as it either doth relate unto the
King, the Metropolitan, or in your case, the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie,
which requires it from you. For the true
ground whereof you may please to know, that in
the Statute 1<hi rend="sup">•</hi>. Eliz. <hi>cap.</hi> 2. whereby the <hi>Common
Praier booke</hi> now in use, was confirmed and esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished,
it was enacted, <hi>That if there shall happen
any irreverence or contempt to be used in the Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
or Rites of the Church, by misusing the Orders
appointed in the same: that then the Queenes Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie,
by the advise of her Commissioners for causes
Ecclesiasticall, or of the Metropolitan, might ordeine
or publish such further Ceremonies or Rites as may bee
most for the advancement of Gods glorie, the edifying
of his Church, and the due reverence of Christ's holy
Mysteries and Sacraments.</hi> A power not personall
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:20504:32"/>
to the Queene onely, when she was alive; but such
as was to be continued also unto her successours.
So that in case the <hi>Common Praier booke</hi> had deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
positively, that the Table should be placed
at all times in the middle of the Church or Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell,
which is not determined of; or that the <hi>Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie</hi>
of his owne autoritie, could not have other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
appointed, which yet is not so: the Kings
most excellent Majestie, on information of the ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reverent
usage of the <hi>holy Table</hi> by all sorts of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
(as it hath beene accustomed in these latter
daies) in sitting on it in time of Sermon, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
prophanely abusing it, in taking Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts,
and making Rates and such like businesses;
may by the last clause of the said Statute, <hi>for the
due reverence of Christ's holy Mysteries and Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi>
with the advice and counsell of his <hi>Metro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politan,</hi>
command it to bee placed where the
<hi>Altar</hi> stood, and to be railed about for the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
decencie. For howsoever in the Act, the <hi>Queen</hi>
be onely named, not <hi>her Heires and Successours;</hi>
yet plainly the autoritie is the same in them, as it
was in her; which may be made apparant by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
Arguments drawne from the Common Law,
and the Act it selfe. First, from the purpose of
that clause, which was to fence the <hi>Rites and Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies</hi>
of the Church, then used, from all <hi>irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence</hi>
and contempt: and for the publishing of
such other <hi>Rites</hi> and <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> as might in further
time be found convenient, for the <hi>advancement of
Gods glorie, the edifying of his Church,</hi> and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curement
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:20504:33"/>
of <hi>due reverence to Christ's holy Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi>
But seeing that the <hi>Rites</hi> 
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nd <hi>Ceremonies</hi> of
the Church, were not onely subject unto <hi>Irreve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence</hi>
and contempt in the said <hi>Queenes</hi> time, but
are, and have been sleighted, and irreverently abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
in time of her <hi>Successors:</hi> the Act had ill
provided for the Churches safetie, in case, the
power of rectifying what was amise, either by
ordering of new Rites, or stablishing the old, did
not belong aswell to her <hi>Successours,</hi> as it did to
her. Next, fro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> the verie phrase and stile which
is there used. For it is said, the <hi>Queene, with the
advice of the Metropolitan might ordeine and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish,
&amp;c.</hi> the <hi>Queene</hi> indefinitely, and the <hi>Metro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politan</hi>
indefinitely, If then by <hi>Queene</hi> indefinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
be onely meant, the person of the Queene then
being, not her <hi>Heires</hi> and <hi>Successours;</hi> by <hi>Metro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politan</hi>
indefinitely, wee must also meane the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolitan</hi>
then being, and not his <hi>Successours:</hi>
and then the power heere given the <hi>Queene,</hi> had
beene determined with the death of Arch-bishop
<hi>Parker,</hi> which was some 28 yeares before her
owne. Thirdly, from another clause in the selfe
same Act, where it is said, that <hi>If any person being
twice convict</hi> (of depraving the booke of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Praier, &amp;c.) <hi>shall off end againe the third time,
and be thereof lawfully convict, hee shall forfeit for
his third offence, to our Soveraign Lady the Queene,
all his Goods and Chattels, &amp;c.</hi> where, though the
<hi>Queene</hi> be onely named, the penaltie of the Law

<pb n="61" facs="tcp:20504:33"/>
Successours;</hi> or else there were no remedy, at this
time, by the Lawes provided, for the third Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt.
Fourthly, from the usuall forme of those
Acts and Statutes, which were made purposely
for the particular and personall profit, safetie, and
advantage of the said <hi>Queene,</hi> which are distingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
from others by this note or Character, viz.

particular relation made by the Counsaile of both

            <p>I doe therefore (to deale plainely) like ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
things well, and disallow of some things in
your cariage of the businesse. It is well done
that you affect decency and comlinesse, in the
officiating of <hi>GOD</hi>'s Divine Ser<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ice; That
you president your selfe with the formes in
his Majesties Chappels, and the Quires of
Cathedrall Churches (if your Quire, as those
others, could containe your whole congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;)
that you doe the reverence appointed by
the Canon to the blessed name of <hi>IESVS,</hi> so
it be done humbly, and not affectedly, to procure
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:20504:37"/>
Devotion, not derision of your Parishioners,
and that you do not maintaine it <hi>Rationibus
non cogentibus,</hi> and so spoile a good Cause
with bad arguments. These things I doe allow
and practise. But that you should be so violent
and earnest for an <hi>Altar</hi> at the upper end of
the <hi>Quire;</hi> That the Table ought to stand <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarwise;</hi>
That the fixing therof in the <hi>Quire</hi>
is <hi>Canonicall,</hi> and that it ought not to bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved
to the body of the Church; I conceive to
be in you so many mistakings.</p>
            <p>For the first, if you should erect any such
<hi>Altar,</hi> which (I know you will not) your discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
will proove the onely <hi>Holocaust</hi> to be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed
thereon. For you have subscribed when
you came to your place, that <hi>That other Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
which the Papists were wont to
offer upon their Altars,</hi> is a Blasphemous fig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and pernicious imposture, <hi>in the thirty
one Article:</hi> And also, that we in the Church
of <hi>England</hi> ought to take heed, lest our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
of a memory, be made a Sacrifice: <hi>In
the first Homilie of the Sacrament.</hi> And
it is not the <hi>Vicar,</hi> but the <hi>Church-wardens,</hi>
that are to provide for the Communion, and
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:20504:38"/>
that not an <hi>Altar,</hi> but a faire joyned Table:
<hi>Canons of the Convocation,</hi> 1571. pag. 18.
And that the <hi>Altars</hi> were removed by Law,
and Tables placed in their stead, in all, or the
most Churches in <hi>England,</hi> appeares by the
<hi>Queenes Injunctions,</hi> 1559. related unto,
and so confirmed in that point by our <hi>Canons</hi>
still in force. And therefore (I know) you
will not change a <hi>Table</hi> into an <hi>Altar,</hi> which
<hi>Vicars</hi> were never inabled to set up, but allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
once with other's to pull downe. <hi>Injun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of</hi> 1<hi rend="sup">•</hi>. Elizab. <hi>for Tables in the
Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the second point. That your Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
Table is to stand <hi>Altar-wise,</hi> if you
meane in that place of the <hi>Chancell,</hi> where
the <hi>Altar</hi> stood, I thinke somewhat may be said
for that; because the <hi>Injunctions</hi> 1559. did so
place it; And I conceive it to be the most decent
situation, when it is not used, and for use too,
where the Quire is mounted up by steps, and
open, so that hee that officiates may bee s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ene
and heard of all the Congregation. Such an
one I heare your <hi>Chancell</hi> is not. But if you
meane by <hi>Altar-wise,</hi> that the Ta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>le should
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:20504:38"/>
stand along close by the wall, so as you be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to officiate at one end thereof (as you may
have observed in great m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ns Chappels:) I
do not believe that ever the Communion Tables
were (otherwise than by casualtie) so placed
in Countrey Churches. For, besides that, the

The use of an <hi>Altar</hi> is to Sacrifice upon, and

so to bee ashamed of the Name. For, besides that

200 yeares more ancient, than the name of an <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar,</hi>
as you may see most learnedly prooved out of
Saint <hi>Paul, Origen,</hi> and <hi>Arnobius,</hi> if you
doe but reade a Booke that is in your Church, <hi>Iewel
against Harding of Private Masse. Art. 3. p.
143.</hi> And whether this name of <hi>Altar</hi> crept in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Church in a kinde of complying in phrase with
the people of the <hi>Iewes,</hi> as I have read in <hi>Chem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitius,
Gerardus,</hi> and other <hi>sound Protestants,</hi>
(yet such as suffer Altars to stand); or that it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
from these Oblations made upon the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
Table, for the vse of the Priest, and the poore,
whereof wee reade in <hi>Iustin Martyr, Iraeneus,
Tertullian,</hi> and other ancient Writers; or because
of the Sacrifice of Praise, and Thankesgiving, as
Arch-bishop <hi>Cranmer,</hi> and others thought, <hi>Acts</hi>
and <hi>Monuments, pag.</hi> 1211. the name being
now so many yeares abolished, it is fitter in my
Iudgement, that the <hi>Altar</hi> (if you will needes so
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:20504:41"/>
call it) should according to the <hi>Canon,</hi> stand
<hi>Tablewise,</hi> than your <hi>Table</hi> to trouble the poore
Towne of <hi>Gr.</hi> because erected otherwise.</p>
            <p>Lastly, that your Table should stand in the higher
part of the Church, you have my assent already in
opinion: but that it should be there fixed, is so farre
from being Canonicall, that it is directly against the
Canon. For what is the <hi>Rubrick</hi> of the Church, but
a <hi>Canon?</hi> And the <hi>Rubrick</hi> saith, it <hi>shall stand
in the body of the</hi> Church, <hi>or of the</hi> Chancell,
<hi>where Morning praier, and Evening prayer
be appointed to be read;</hi> If therefore Morning
and Evening prayer bee app<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>inted to be read in the
body of the Church, (as in most countrey Churches it
is) where shall the Table stand most Canonically?
And so is the Table made removeable, when the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
is to be celebrated, to such place as <hi>the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister
may be most conveniently hea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Communicants,</hi> by <hi>Qu. Eliz. Injunct.</hi> 1559.
And so saith the <hi>Canon</hi> in force, that <hi>in the time
of the Communion, the Table shall bee pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
in so good sort within the Church and
Chancel, as therby the Minister may be more
