            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>By very good consequence then, your Lordships publict Character, bringing your eminent Qualifications upon the publick Stage, to exert themselves for general U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tility, (the only Heroick Action Man is capable of,) at once giving you the oportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and making it your concern, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute all your Talents for the <hi>publick good</hi> and as a no small mean to that end for the Improvement of <hi>Medicine</hi> also, does notably both qualify your Lp: a very fit <hi>Patron</hi> for such a Subject; &amp; encourage me to implore your protection thereto <hi>life</hi> &amp; <hi>health</hi> being so

obtained till <hi>Galen</hi>'s dayes, who had the confidence to dissent from <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> the great Restorer of Medicine, about the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Cure of Several Diseases, which for the most part he strains to a <hi>Theory</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to the <hi>Philosophy</hi> of his time, that pesters not only <hi>Medicine,</hi> bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And thô in the <hi>Aetimology</hi> of Diseases he wreasts the <hi>Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomes</hi> to his pre-conceived <hi>Notions</hi>; yet such was the genius of the succeeding Ages, that they were content to follow him as a <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern,</hi> and to acknowledge him for a <hi>Text</hi>; so his Works in succession of time came to be equally esteem'd with <hi>Hippocrat</hi>'s, and then nothing was to be received that was not agreeable unto them. And as this for some Ages did manifestly hinder all ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance in Medicine, so of necessity it cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates a vast Opposition to all new Inventions; of which the <hi>Physiological</hi> Discoveries in the beginning of this Age are an Instance with a witness. And thô they had the demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration of our Senses to support them; yet the Credit and Reputation of the ancient <hi>Theory,</hi> (that was quite overturned by them) was such, that with difficulty they were brought to have reception. If it so fared than with the Discoveries that were not
<pb facs="tcp:106684:8"/>
only reasonable, but demonstrable by our Senses; what can we expect shall be the Fate of those that have not that advantage to pretend to? especially if we consider that what we plead for, is, <hi>A new Cure of Fevers,</hi> that is, to encounter the opposition of the received practice of all former Ages; which generally speaking was far more so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid than the <hi>Theory.</hi>

            <head>THE PREFACE</head>
            <p>IF any shall marvel why, unto the great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and bulk of Books under which, as a surcharge, this World in a manner groans; I should add one: Let him know, that this repri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand does very little concern the <hi>Physitians</hi> of this Nation; for while the <hi>Physicians</hi> of all places besides, has liberally profered to the World their s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ntiments in Medicine, ours has been so little taken with the Itch of writing on that subject, that they have modestly kept their thoughts to themsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves. And indeed I, as one of the least, should have been swallowed up with silence, in the vast gulf of time with the rest; unless the like case, that is reported to have befallen the Son of <hi>Craesus,</hi> had befallen me: For he having been from his birth dumb; seing a Souldier set upon his Father, (the vehement fervency breaking the bonds that keeped his Tongue fettered) cryed out, <hi>Souldier do not kill Craesus</hi>! and indeed the like seeming to have hapened to me, has had likewayes the same effect: For I having been alwayes Tongue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tied
<pb facs="tcp:106684:12"/>
as to this manner of speaking (that is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting) until I perceived the Endeavours of some, to attack not only my Name and Fame, but which is far more; to assault with Calumnies and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches, the most genuine and solid Methods of Medicine, about the <hi>Cure of Continual Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,</hi> invented and delivered by that Expert Dr <hi>Thomas Sydenham,</hi> and very earnestly em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced by me, as having found them most succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful by experience: In so much, that for some time bygone, in which Fevers have been very fatal to this place, there has been few that died thereof, which fame <hi>(as much tenacious of depraved fictions as a Messenger of Truth)</hi> has not scattered far and wide, to have been destroyed by me, or this Method: Whence fearing a danger yet more from <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>his, that by the neglect of this most excellent Method, in this manner noted with In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famy, many of my Countrey-men and Neighbours may be indangered or lost; what wonder is it then, if so great evils private and publick, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite in me such an ardor, as brusting the bonds of my Tongue also, make me poure forth these faltering words.</p>
            <p>And further, as in some cases evil manners use to beget good Laws; so perhaps in this caise, Reproaches and Calumnies producing Defences against them, may also produce and display more plainly the truth and real improvements.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:106684:12"/>Since then my Reputation seems to suffer Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdom for the Publick Concerne and Safety, all kind of reproaches being liberally bestowed on me, for this Cause, and seing I despise my Private utility in respect of the publick Commodity; And neglect the dictats of Self-interest, that whispers to me, that it were easier to go in the broad way with the multitude; or at least to keep such a notable Improvement to my self, then to have left that way; and invite all to be partakers with me in that discoverie: I hope then what I write will be the more acceptable to all good and inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous Men.</p>
            <p>Having also set before me that mark and more Noble Aim, <hi>the general good of Mankind;</hi> I suppose I may reach it the more happily by tread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the path of true Vertue; and injuring or reproaching no Man: Yea, not so much as indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly; unless when I am hampered in the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, requiring private Reputation or Commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to be offered up for publick safety: As when these offer to start up in the way to bar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> out this or any other Improvement.</p>
            <p>As few in this place, are ignorant of the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion which gave rise to the Calumnies with which I complain this Method and my self to be blundered, so there is few that know the real truth and Circumstances of the thing as it was
<pb facs="tcp:106684:13"/>
acted: Wherefore I presume it will not be unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to ingenious Persons to hear a faithful Relation of the whole matter.</p>
            <p>If by vertue of the advancement with which the writings of the Sagacious Dr. <hi>Sydenham</hi> had before inriched Medicine, the rest of his dictats should vindicate to themselves as their due, authority and trust; I, for my part, did alwayes think that these were most deservedly to be bestowed upon them: Especially since I had found his former Improvements, being subjected to the Touchstone of Experience and Practice, so seldom to defeat the expectation and wishes.</p>
            <p>But in the Year <hi>1687</hi> perusing the first Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his <hi>Schedula Monito<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ia,</hi> where he deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers as confirmed by manifold experience, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a new, but a quite contrarie Method to the common, of Curing <hi>Continual Fevers</hi>: I did long hesitat, thinking that either he, or all other <hi>Physicians</hi> were grosly deceived, about the Cure of <hi>Fevers;</hi> if not, as their Patients use to be, they were in an high <hi>Delirium;</hi> and lest the preconceived opinion that I had of the Mans In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity should so far impose upon my Credulity, as to draw me into an error likewayes with him; and make me to experiment that method, when I knew not but I might run the hazard to sacrifice some to my Temerity; nothing could settle my tossed thoughts below the sight and knowledge of the thing it self.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:106684:13"/>Presently therefore hastning to <hi>London,</hi> and having met with the Man, and exposed the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion of my coming, I found all these tokens con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning him and his Practice, that use to beget in warry and prudent People making serious In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry, Trust and Knowledge. Then after some Months spent in this Society, returning home as much overjoyed as I had gotten a Treasure; I presently set my self to that Practice: Which has proved so succesful to me, that since that time, of the many Fevers that I have treated, none were unoured, except my Lord <hi>Creichton,</hi> whose case is related here: And another Woman, whose dangerous circumstances made her condition hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less.</p>
            <p>And among those that were cured, as there were some afflicted with that disproportion of the Symptomes and other <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ircumstances commonly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noting malignity; which may ext<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>l the efficacy of the Method: So there were some of my nearest Relations, as my Wife &amp; six of my Children, taken also with pernicious Fevers thereby likewayes cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, which is an evidence of my sufficient proof of the Method: But in the mean time what pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of these that are medicate by the common Method is lost? which whither it be by the force of the Disease, or by the Method, it seems highly the Physicians concern to enquire.</p>
            <p>Coming then to my Lord <hi>Creichton</hi> the six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth
<pb facs="tcp:106684:14"/>
day of his Fever, when he was given over by all for dead, his Grave Cloaths being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared, I did reason with my self, if, exposing the credit of this Method; yet in the Infancy to such an hazard, it should receive the foil, it would surely be a difficult task to bring it in grace; especially with the Vulgar: But on the other hand weighing, if I could astipulate the Method with one or more of such Instances of success, that this would by great steps, and more then the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry progress of many Years, elevate its Authority and Credit; And so I should, hastning that pace of Improvement to the great benefit of Mankind, superate these obstinate difficulties put by humane Infirmitie, not to say worse, making such always slow in advance: For in so far only as they have Authority, the best and most salutiferous Methods do only streach their Protection and Safe-guard. And further, I being seized with a most ardent desire of the safety of that Noble Person, there was scarce any thing that I esteemed too much to expose to hazard, if it did bring any glimses of hope of his Recovery: For all the hope that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained with me of his Health, seemed to ly in the prosecution of that Method as the caise would bear.</p>
            <p>But surely Divine Providence esteeming me un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of such auspicious success, or to work so stupenduous a miracle; And also finding me alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
<pb facs="tcp:106684:14"/>
Incapable to bear so prodigious a Fortune, did therefore suppress and defeat my hope, and perhapes Ambition, in the Fate of that Noble Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</p>
            <p>Now followes the History of his Disease from the time that I did first see him.</p>
            <p>In the <hi>16</hi>th day of his <hi>Fever</hi> (the chief symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom whereof being a high and difficult breathing, threatning suffocation, and that all along the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease.) He was taken with a grievious <hi>Parox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ism,</hi> wherein he lay several houres Dumb and Deaf, neither (like a Man expiring,) did he know these standing about him, under this fit his ast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hmatick <hi>Paroxism</hi> did remitt, by the use of an antiparalitick electuary his Speech and Hearing returned, but accompanied with a high <hi>Deliri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um.</hi> This morbifick Matter being now turgide and moveable, and further Fluctuating from one place to another, and the translation thereof into the Lungs being again impendent, by asthamatick and anhelous Symptomes beginning; seemed to insinuate the <hi>Indication</hi> of Derivation and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vacuation of that Matter, and that not only ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the rules of this Method, but also of the common Method, both coninciding in this point of <hi>Indication</hi> in a Body (Especially such as this patient had) filled with viscuous Humors; his Strength and appetite being moderatly consistent, and some glimpses likewayes of <hi>Concoction</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing in the Vrine.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:106684:15"/>There is then Administred to him in the <hi>18</hi>th. day, a lenient potion in partited Doses, which gave several Stooles without any Pain or prostra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Strength; after which the anbelosity and Fever seemed much to be alleviat, and the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lirium altogether to be gone, in the Evening a sleepi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness seased him, and in the night he had several stooles; Neither the day following was the loos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness altogether stoped, now his strength &amp; appetite being consistent, &amp; the dejections being more urgent in frequency then quantity; No <hi>Indication</hi> did yet perswad the interposing a check to them; And the sleepiness continuing admonished caution in the use of the Paregorick; Yet toward night it was determined by he use thereof to Moderat, but not to stop the loosness. Here the <hi>Curative Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation</hi> in respect of the disease, and <hi>Conserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Indication</hi> in respect of the Strength inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring, required great Caution, least aiming at the Cure of the Disease by indulging the loosness, the Strength might be infringed, or on the other hand, when the Strength should be consulted by binding up of the Belly, the Disease and Morbifick matter should become more Impacted, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gurgitate on the <hi>Pulmons,</hi> then having exhibite that night two small Doses of the <hi>Paregorick,</hi> I seemed to hitt the marke: With which Method throw the whole course of the Disease he was treated: Giving less or more Vent to his Belly by
<pb facs="tcp:106684:15"/>
the counsel of the more pressing <hi>Indications,</hi> and that by the use or abstinence of the <hi>Paregorick</hi> interposing a Moderately warm Dyet, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectorating <hi>Lohoch, restaceous Pouders,</hi> and <hi>volatile Salts,</hi> in small partited Doses. And indeed this Method seemed in so farr succesful that every one that visited him had great hopes of his Recovery, until the <hi>24</hi>th. day of his Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in the morning, the <hi>Morbifick</hi> matter fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling again precipitantly into the Lungs, (notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing his Belly being soluble, and neither, in respect of the most pressing <hi>Indication,</hi> too much) raised again an high and Vebement breathing, most difficult expectoration of viscid Flegm, which threatned to stiffle him, with an intension of the <hi>Fever,</hi> all which increassing, towards mid-day, this Noble Person Expired.</p>
            <p>And here it comes to be observed, for the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence it might have upon this Patient, that, that day the Air was infected with the thickest Mist has been seen, now how much such Air Influences many Bodies Disposed to receive the impressions thereof, notwithstanding the closness of Roumes and Fires, many can testify by the effects thereof in themselves, and is further very clear from the Doctrine of <hi>Perspiration,</hi> by which appears how much the Impurity of the Air contributes both to stop the perspirable matter, and to diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultate the Bloods passage throw the Lungs; As will be clear afterwards.</p>

               <pb facs="tcp:106684:16"/>In the Body being opened all the Bowels and solide Parts were found to be sound, and his Disease to be only in the Fluides, for the Wind-pipes in the Lungs were so puffed up with viscide flegme, that aTub being fixed to the <hi>Trach-artery,</hi> and blowen as hard as one of the bystand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers could do, yet the Lungs could not be streatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to any further dimension.</p>
            <p>This then is the case that has raised such a Storm of Calumny against this Method: And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed least Men should think that there is no case so full of difficulty and danger, which will not yield to an effectual Method, therefore this, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho in many it has been formerly effectual, could only prolong his Life for eight dayes; and make such a turn in his condition, as to give no small signes of recovery; with a perfect tranquillity all that time both in his Body and mind.</p>
            <p>But now to return to the Method, which can be no more convelled by this singular Instance, yea by many more if they could be given, then other methods may be, under which there are so very many that dayly miscarry, especially seing this me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod is so much confirmed by the experiences of many <hi>Physicians</hi> both at <hi>London,</hi> and here Practising it so succesfully; that it is rare if at all, any Person does dye under it: By which its use and security is sufficiently confirmed.</p>
            <p>Moreover, in this Essay, I have further attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb facs="tcp:106684:16"/>
to shew how rational a <hi>Method</hi> it is; And that in favours of such Pallats, as can relish no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing without that.</p>
            <p>And the Reasonableness thereof will be more obvious to any that will with me perpend the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress of the <hi>Operation</hi> of the <hi>oeconomie,</hi> and remarke that the <hi>animal oeconomy</hi> is founded in a <hi>Mechanick</hi> structure, to witt, in matter and motion: Vpon whose Integrity and Vigour the soundness of the <hi>oeconomie,</hi> and from whose <hi>Labefaction,</hi> the vitiation thereof depends, and so this <hi>Machine</hi> like other <hi>Engines</hi> has a principle measure and end of its motion: The principle is the first <hi>Impellent</hi> or <hi>Impetum Faciens,</hi> according to <hi>Hypocrates,</hi> or the <hi>Arche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> according to <hi>Helmont,</hi> or the <hi>Spirits</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the common opinion, the necessity whereof is clear in the sequel of this discourse: to the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of the motion there is required the due <hi>Ener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie</hi> of the <hi>Impellent,</hi> and the <hi>Aptitude</hi> and <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quacity</hi> of the moveable matter; To which when it is liquide, there is required also the due <hi>Aper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> &amp; <hi>Smothness</hi> of the passages throw which the motion is to be made.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Energie</hi> of the <hi>Impellent</hi> vitiate is either primarie, and not depending upon the Fault of the moveable matter, and this seemes a case alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether beyond Art to repair: Or its Fault is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent, and that is either when its <hi>Energie</hi> is
<pb facs="tcp:106684:17"/>
augmented, as when the Humours or Organs do not yield to its due <hi>Impulse,</hi> then to attaine its end, it adds more force; Which often making the motion to be propagated beside the designe, terminates in <hi>Collisions</hi> and <hi>Reflections;</hi> As if the <hi>Impellent</hi> were affected with <hi>Fury</hi> or <hi>Anger:</hi> As is seen in <hi>Convulsions,</hi> and <hi>Histerick Affects,</hi> and in <hi>Fevers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Or the <hi>Impellent</hi> may be vitiated by its <hi>Energie</hi> diminished, as when it is stupified and <hi>Inviscat</hi> by gross Humores, as is seen in many <hi>Chronick Affects.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Aptitude of the moveable matter in the so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid parts is vitiate by their rigidity, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends upon gross Humors that fill up their <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bres,</hi> or their <hi>Junctures</hi> or <hi>Hinges,</hi> upon which in their motion they are turned: the fault in the liquide parts, such as the Humors, whither Ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentitious or Excrementitious, depends upon there grosness or viscosity also: which soon begets slow<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ness, Imprinting a blemish upon the functions, &amp; eluding the end of the <hi>oeconomy;</hi> Notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Incitation of the <hi>Impellent,</hi> and its out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most <hi>Effort</hi> to attain the end of the <hi>oeconomy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The faults of the Channels &amp; Vessells consists either in their straitning obstructing or <hi>Scabrici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi>? Which alwayes depend, unless when they are from an external and compressing Cause, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the same grosness of Humors stuffing their
<pb facs="tcp:106684:17"/>
Chanells, Coats, or Fibres.</p>
            <p>So the fundamental cause of most, if not all, Diseases, seemes to be the grosness of the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mores causing their slowness, making soon bad Impressions upon the functions; To overcome which, providing the <hi>Impellent</hi> be veget and not Inviscat, it stirs up struglings, whence comes <hi>Orgasimes, Reflections</hi> &amp; other depravations of motion, as consequential to the attemps for obtaining the due measures of its motion.</p>
            <p>Now from this Easie &amp; Obvious <hi>Hypothesis</hi> the Nature of <hi>Fevers</hi> is here clearly enucleat, whilst Authors feign many <hi>Chimerical Phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tasmes</hi> to explain the <hi>Phaenomena,</hi> by which they become rather the more Intricat.</p>
            <p>It seemes likewayes not improbable that the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veable fluide Matter, being deprived of its due mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, acquires various Configurations of its minute parts which make it troublesome to the Fibres or Channels of the Vessels: and this seems withal to be the Immediat Material cause of many <hi>Depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations</hi> of motion, such as <hi>Refractions, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections,</hi> and <hi>Collision</hi> raised by the incita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Impellent;</hi> and so from the compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of these, the varietie of symptoms, and the indefinite multitude of Diseases is begotten.</p>
            <p>And even as that motion of the blood, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called <hi>Circulation</hi> or <hi>Circuit</hi> of the blood, did strangelie ly in the dark, for many
<pb facs="tcp:106684:18"/>
Ages; and was with difficultie received by many, because, which was often brought to its reproach, that although it seemed to illustrate the <hi>Theorie</hi> of <hi>Medicine,</hi> yet it made no improvement in the practice thereof: so now that noble invention will not only be delivered from that reproach, but will be yet further imbellished, if we can evince this motion of the blood vitiated, <hi>viz.</hi> its slowness depending upon grosness to be, if not of most dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases, yet the nearest and continent cause of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual Fevers: And moreover if it can be shown of what <hi>Concatenation</hi> or <hi>Complication</hi> of cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses this nearest cause by order or congress is fomen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; how many fruitful &amp; solid <hi>indications</hi> alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether formerly in the dark, may there be drawn from thence? especiallie seing we may be furnished with sufficient means to satisfie these <hi>indications</hi> &amp; that either by the <hi>correction, intercepting,</hi> or <hi>eradicating</hi> of those causes being distinctlie known.</p>
            <p>And so I have expede this <hi>method</hi> of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous <hi>Sydenham Theoretically</hi> and <hi>Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally</hi> with as much Brevitie and Perspicuitie as I could: but with what fruit or fate I know not; but if this essay be received with the same Inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuitie it is offered, if it do not reach to the full design, it will at least as is hoped be favourablie constructed: For many may run at a prize,
<pb facs="tcp:106684:18"/>
but only one enjoyes it: And amongst all that have attempted to make discoveries, none has been so happy as to discover all; but one has found out one thing; and another an other thing: And Chance rather than Art hath led many Search<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers beyond their Intensions to discover notable things: Some whereof may bring light, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther some may bring Fruit to <hi>medicine;</hi> out of which the succeeding Ages by a prudent choice, may perhaps gather materialls to compile a more solide <hi>Systeme,</hi> especially of Practical medicine; then is yet extant: To which whither or not this attempt may contribute any thing, let others judge; but not these, that by their precipitant sentences against this method, have made them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves parties in this Plea.</p>
            <p>If no other advantage come of this design, this at least I hope may be the effect of it, that as the barking of the little Dogs raises the courage of the great ones, so these aimes may rouse to the more profound diving into the sublime and obscure Nature of Fevers; these. <q>
                  <hi>Quibus ex meliori luto finxit praecordia Titan.</hi>
               </q> But whatsomever benefit or advantage may come to the Publick by this design, unto my self praise, or advantage, I expect none; because herein having ingaged against so many, who
<pb facs="tcp:106684:19"/>
perhaps esteeming themselves obscured, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence not a little injured, will necessarlie therefore become picqued; and follow closs the opportunitie and advantages of their resentment.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>It being also very certain that in propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as this Essay appeares fraught with any benefite to Mankind, that the wicked</hi> Serpentine brood <hi>still big with malice, and envious of the good of Men, and which was never more</hi> Dominant <hi>then at this time; Will rake all the corners of</hi> Hell <hi>for</hi> Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nom <hi>to bespatter it with; And this may be a Grave marke, by which Honest Men that are not so very</hi> Penetrating, <hi>may Judge whither it contains any thing useful or not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as it falls out for the most part in the World, that man makes but a sorry bargain, who gratifies one to the (altho but supposed) detriment of another; the resentment of the inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry often proving more heavy, then the result of gratitude for the benefite done can any wayes allay: Reveng being a natural, is also a rank thriving-weed in the mind of man; Whereas gratitude being like an exotick plant requires diligent culture to make it grow there.</p>
            <p>But above all, benefits done to the publick, meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with least acknowledgment and recompense, (having so many concerned have for the most part therefore none concerned) do therefore strangly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
<pb facs="tcp:106684:19"/>
the Benefactor to the resentments of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>se that suppose themselves injured, for private and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Interest seem to be alwayes at war, where the publick receives the foill: And indeed therefore I might have consulted my own praise and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit more, by treading the broad way, and beaten path with the multitude, thô with ever so much hurt to Mankind.</p>
            <p>But this is not all, for the World is no more Barren of gratitude and acknowledgment, than it is fertil and productive of Calumnies and slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders: And these levelling at reputation and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>name, throw them oftentimes wounding our For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, (the Integrity and Increase of the one de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending much on the soundness of the other) makes him that steals ones Goods, only so much the less faulter, than him that wronges their name, in respect he that steals does it with design rather to advantage himself, than to wrong his neighbour: but he that wounds ones name, doing it maliciously, has nothing for most part by the loss, and even this atrocious cryme, being of deeper dy, has also many more intangled therein, then people are well awar: for not only the first broaching and venting of calumnies with design, is culpable, but also all that propagate the same; since it is no more certain, that fire dies without feuel, than that injurious calumnies and slanders die without their being kept in life, by their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb facs="tcp:106684:20"/>
propagate and handed from one to another: the heaviest part then of the guilt seems to lye in that propagating, and so on the Propagator: And the want of an injurious design in them that do it, can no more excuse here (all the strength of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse lying in the like stupid inconsideration of the necessary consequences of such deeds) than he that either hands, or trains with fewel a Fire, tho kindled by another, into the Thatch of a Mans house, can be excused by pretending Inadvertance or incon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ideration; the effects of the one being as obvious as the other: And so the matter being duely considered, makes the one case of no less atrocious guilt than th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> other.</p>

               <hi>IF any quarrel the Language, or Stile, let him remember the case of the Son of</hi> Craesus: <hi>This being the first</hi> Essay <hi>I have made to speak after this manner, no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, it be not so very</hi> Articulate, <hi>as Use (which perfites all things) would have made it.</hi>

<pb n="112" facs="tcp:106684:82"/>
                  <hi>Hipothesis</hi> of <hi>Fevers</hi> already laid down: For if we take a view, and find that all these things which as external causes bring Imoderate Heat, that the same do bring on a pace with them <hi>thickness</hi> and <hi>crassness</hi> of the Blood; Which is necessarly followed with the slowness of its motion; And so to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the parts with proportionable reparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on suitable to the waste that is made, the <hi>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celeration</hi> is <hi>stimulated,</hi> and frequent pulses are excited, in proportion to that thickness and slowness of the Blood: as it falls out in <hi>vehement motions of Body</hi> and <hi>Minde</hi>; Great and long heat of the <hi>Sun,</hi> and <hi>fire</hi>; the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessive abuse of strong Liquors, and in <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiration</hi> impeded, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the <hi>vehement motion</hi> of the Body, beside the above mentioned <hi>grateing</hi> of the <hi>muscles</hi> upon one another, and upon the parts ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jacent exciting heat, there is also such a <hi>waste</hi> of <hi>spirits</hi> and <hi>particles</hi> of the <hi>Blood</hi> and <hi>humours</hi> which in motion do exhale, that, to make proportionable supply and <hi>refo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cillation</hi> with the <hi>arterial blood,</hi> the heart is made to mend its pace; As also that <hi>copious eruption</hi> of <hi>exhalations,</hi> which sometimes comes to the degree of <hi>sweat,</hi> leaving the Blood, and Humors more gross and thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, must necessarily also increase the <hi>slow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi>
                  <pb n="113" facs="tcp:106684:82"/>
of its <hi>motion,</hi> which therefore crave grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and repeated force to <hi>squeeze</hi> it forward into these narrow <hi>Channels</hi>: And so from all these circumstances, in violent motion there is raised a <hi>paroxisme</hi> as to Heat and Pulse altogether resembling a <hi>Fever:</hi> Which is mu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>h after the same manner also produced by all the rest of external causes exciting Heat; but with this difference, that the Heat coming from the abuse of <hi>spirituous</hi> Liquors (as apears by the Spirit of Wine, which being poured upon <hi>Blood</hi> doth immediately co-agulate the same) comes from their immediate incrassating and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agulating effect upon the <hi>Blood</hi>: Which <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crassation</hi> has likewayes and for the same cause, that <hi>stimulating</hi> effect upon the Heart. And how stopt perspiration produces Heat shall be in its due place shown.</p>
               <p>Whence we may conclude, that all <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tense</hi> Heat grivous to the Body, is the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuin effect of the grosness of the Blood; as it is clear by the <hi>contemplation</hi> of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity of the <hi>Causes,</hi> and the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the <hi>Phoenomena</hi> Natural and Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctical belonging to both, and shall after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward more fully be shown.</p>
               <p>Having thus far premised, It remains to clear how this <hi>Thickness</hi> and <hi>Grossness</hi> of the
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:106684:83"/>
                  <hi>Blood</hi> produces also <hi>intense Heat:</hi> And that the same Heat does not establish, but rather evert both the <hi>Effervessence</hi> of the Blood and the swiftness of that motion thereof, by some called the <hi>circulation,</hi> and by others the <hi>circuit</hi> of the <hi>Blood.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In prosecution whereof, it is to be noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, that in the natural state of Health, the Heat is more strong and veget, then in the valetudinary state, where it is fretting and with trouble felt: For in the state of Health the <hi>Rayes</hi> of Heat (now whither or not these be thickly compacted together <hi>troops</hi> of <hi>Spirits</hi> it seems not worth the while to contend) these <hi>Rayes</hi> (I say) do chearfully and pleasantly glide with the <hi>arterial Blood</hi> throw the Channels of the Arteries, in a fluid, sequacious and yeilding enough; and by passages open sufficiently, toward all the <hi>Bowels, Organs,</hi> and <hi>Habit</hi> of the Body; for their <hi>refoccilation,</hi> in which for the most part they are consumed: And so from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual <hi>efflux</hi> of these <hi>Rayes</hi> chearfully ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complshed, does result the <hi>faelicity</hi> and <hi>ease</hi> of Life, and integrity of the functions of the <hi>Oeconomy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But in the state of sickness, and cheifly in the <hi>heat</hi> of <hi>Fevers,</hi> these <hi>rayes</hi> or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies of <hi>Spirits</hi> flowing throw a <hi>viseuous</hi> &amp;

dispersed every where throw the Body, that therefore they should imprint therein a greater sense of <hi>Heat</hi> then usual: Or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes by <hi>reflection,</hi> which comes to the same purpose, as when these <hi>rayes</hi> are darted throw the <hi>trunes</hi> of the <hi>Arteries,</hi> &amp; incid up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the small Channels obstructed either in whole or in part by this crass Blood, they must necessarly, being reflected several ways <hi>impinge</hi> on the <hi>Nervs</hi> the sensorie of <hi>Heat</hi>; and affect them with more <hi>brisk twitches</hi> then if they did glide smoothly along the <hi>trunks,</hi> and by open passages were dispersed, and exhausted in there designed ends.</p>
               <p>And that the sense of <hi>intense heat</hi> is made much after the same manner, seems clear by the <hi>Instance</hi> mentioned before, to witt when the <hi>breath</hi> is with a wide mouth slow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly exhaled, it gives the sense of <hi>heat</hi> upon the hand; Because the Particles of the <hi>breath</hi> are not caried streight and directly forward, but being dispersed by an <hi>Oblique transvorse</hi> and <hi>rec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The due expulsion of this perspirable matter depends upon the integrity of all the <hi>concurring causes</hi> thereof, whither <hi>efficient, matterial,</hi> or <hi>instrumental</hi>: And as an <hi>efficient</hi> here (beside the <hi>first impellent</hi> the common <hi>efficient</hi> of all the motions of the Body) the Air by its <hi>elasticity</hi> and <hi>expansive</hi> power seems to have no small influence thereupon, for the Air being in the act of inspiration drawen into the <hi>lungs,</hi> and the <hi>vesicles</hi> thereof filled thereby, by the <hi>Heat</hi> of the <hi>lungs</hi> it is also <hi>rarefied,</hi> and thereby re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring a greater room, does also by its force distend these <hi>vesicles</hi>; whose stru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture being with a narrow entry and large cavity, the Air therein contained and in expiration compressed, is not all in

And further, the mixture of the Air with the
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:106684:88"/>
arterial Blood is clear, by that Experiment of <hi>Mayow, Page</hi> 144. who putting <hi>venal</hi> Blood into the <hi>pneumatick engine,</hi> and pump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Air therefrom found it made on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a small <hi>ebulition:</hi> But having used <hi>ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial blood</hi> so, it made a wonderful <hi>expansion</hi> and <hi>boiled</hi> up into a great deal of <hi>spumosity,</hi> and that by reason of the great Quantity of Air contained therein, which <hi>expanding</hi> upon the weakning the pressure of the <hi>ambient Air,</hi> does dilate it self, and the Blood in which it is <hi>inviscate</hi> in proportion to the pressure of the <hi>Air</hi> that remained after the Pumping. And further the ingress of the Air into, and mixture thereof with the blood, is clear by this <hi>phaenomenon,</hi> that the <hi>superfice</hi> and <hi>extremities</hi> of the body, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come <hi>tumified</hi> when the body is heated by <hi>motion</hi>; for then there are ordinarly more frequent and greater <hi>inspirations</hi> of <hi>Air</hi> into the <hi>Lungs,</hi> which the violent motion of the Body disperses thorow the several Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers. As also, the same is made further e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident, because the <hi>Hypothesis</hi> gives only the clear solution how the skine rises upon the application of <hi>cuping glasses,</hi> for the Air within the Body finding the Air within the Glass, not of equal resistance, doth by its <hi>elasticity</hi> expand it self and raise the flesh

<pb n="126" facs="tcp:106684:89"/>
heat, there is further required some other <hi>proper volatilising efficient,</hi> which the <hi>Air</hi> may be clearly judged to be: For as <hi>Helmont</hi> and <hi>Tachenius</hi> observes, timber putriefying in the free <hi>Air</hi> gives by <hi>calcining</hi> little or no <hi>fixed Salt</hi>: And dry Herbs give far less quantity thereof, then green Herbes do; For this reason, that the <hi>Air</hi> being the <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per menstruum</hi> of that <hi>Salt</hi>; Yea even of the same <hi>Salt</hi> within our Body does dissolve &amp; extract it. And likewise the influence that <hi>pure Air</hi> has upon our Bodies, and which is observed by <hi>Helmont,</hi> must be also from this reason; For in <hi>serene</hi> and cold <hi>Air</hi> we eat and digest better Because that <hi>Air</hi> not being Saturat with <hi>fuliginous</hi> and <hi>noxious</hi> Particles; In running its course throw the Body, sweeps out powerfully the <hi>perspirable matter,</hi> and for the like reason these that Sail long on the Sea, eat very much and have fewer <hi>sensible excrements</hi> then other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes: Because the continual and swift motion of the Body not only promoves <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gestion</hi> and <hi>distribution</hi> of the aliement (as will be shown afterward) but also pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moves <hi>perspiration,</hi> by the continual <hi>agitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> and <hi>shaking</hi> of the Body; Which looses any of the Particles of the <hi>perspirable matter</hi> that incline to stick in the <hi>passages</hi> and <hi>pores,</hi> and so the <hi>Air</hi> more easily sweeps off that
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:106684:89"/>
                  <hi>perspirable matter.</hi> And also, (as our <hi>worthy Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor Sydenham</hi> observes) long riding has the same effect and it may be thought for the same reason, and the effects of both these motions, are likewise observed by <hi>Sancto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius,</hi> in his <hi>Aphorismes, Sect</hi> 7. where he shews that ryding respects most the <hi>expulsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of the <hi>perspirable matter</hi> above the <hi>Loynes:</hi> And that <hi>ambling</hi> is most wholsome, but <hi>trotting</hi> unwholsome: and that the being long carried in <hi>a Boat</hi> or in <hi>a Litter</hi> is also most wholsome as disposing to <hi>perspiration.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It follows next to be shown that the due <hi>expulsion</hi> of this <hi>perspirable matter</hi> seems fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to depend upon the <hi>integrity</hi> of the <hi>instrumental, matterial</hi> and <hi>nearest causes</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, such as, The strength and firmness of the <hi>Fibers</hi> and <hi>Glands</hi> of the skine, The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient <hi>aperture</hi> of these <hi>passages</hi> and <hi>pores</hi> thorow which it must go. And lastly, the sufficient <hi>tenuity</hi> and <hi>sequacity</hi> of that <hi>perspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable matter.</hi> But what things help or hurt here, will be too great a Digression to mention, seeing the Author <hi>Sanctorius</hi> may be consulted concerning it himself; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause that very useful Treatise is scarce to be had; we have therefore placed down af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all, a <hi>select parcel</hi> of his <hi>Statical Aphorisms:</hi> It remains then only now to shew, that
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:106684:90"/>
one or more of these requisites to <hi>perspira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> being vitiated; that <hi>perspirable Matter</hi> may be retained and accumulate about the borders of the <hi>capillary</hi> vessels; until by its burden and bulk it provok the <hi>Fibers</hi> to its <hi>expulsion</hi> by sweat, all sweat especially giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ease coming from a great and undue collection of <hi>perspirable Matter,</hi> seems there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore never to be a Natural Excretion, or to have place or use in perfect Health, and is only profitable in so far as it shuns a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er evil, and carries the same respect to the <hi>Excrements</hi> of the third <hi>concoction,</hi> that a <hi>Flux</hi> of the Belly does to these of the first or second; and those that sweat most, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spire least in the Natural order &amp; manner, as <hi>Sanctorius</hi> shews <hi>Aphoris.

That <hi>Sweating</hi> is not good, because it abates the strength of the <hi>Fibers,</hi> yet seing it di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts a worse evil, it may be called respe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctively good.</p>
               <p>But if <hi>Nature,</hi> either out of Sluggish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness or Weakness, do not provide against the retention of this <hi>perspirable Matter</hi> by <hi>Sweat</hi> or some otherwayes, it being still farther accumulate threatens a Disease, and very often a <hi>Fever,</hi> after this manner; for this <hi>perspirable Matter</hi> retained, being wholly <hi>excrementitious</hi> and unapt to be indued with
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:106684:90"/>
Spirits degenerates into <hi>viscosity,</hi> and it may be into <hi>Purulency</hi>: and lying into the confines of the <hi>Veines,</hi> among the fibres of the Flesh, which being irritated by its bulk and use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lessness, do wring it out into the <hi>Channells</hi> of these <hi>Veines</hi>: And so being easily absor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed by the refluent Blood, it infects by its <hi>viscidity</hi> and <hi>Purulency</hi> the <hi>Particles</hi> and <hi>glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buls</hi> of the Blood; Increassing there <hi>bigness</hi> and vitiatng there <hi>Spherical</hi> figure: Which Blood thus vitiat, being carried back to the Heart by the <hi>Veines,</hi> and from it into the <hi>Arteries</hi> to be dispersed throw the whole Body, is with much difficulty admitted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the small <hi>capillary vessels,</hi> by reason of the disproportion of these <hi>globuls</hi> unto the conduites, or their <hi>scabricity</hi>; making their passage difficult: so that the heart is forced to double its pulses to drive on the Blood, to supply the craving parts with their due nourishment. And albeit often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the heart doth by this assiduous la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour overcome these obstructions, (for the <hi>vigorous agitation</hi> of the Blood, and of these <hi>globuls</hi> upon an another, doth so atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate and polish them, that they are made to pass without sticking, and so many thereof as are not redintegrable, as <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spirable matter</hi> are expelled:) Yet some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times these obstructions by their obstinacy

               <p>Now that the Progress and Pedigree of a <hi>Fever</hi> may be after this manner, is much more probable, because it is very consonant to the Sentiment of <hi>Sanctorius,</hi> who in the first <hi>Section</hi> of his <hi>Aphorisms,</hi> declares, That, <hi>the perspirable Matter retained, neither being dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cussed by Nature nor by a</hi> Fever <hi>superveening, presently disposes the Body to a</hi> Malignant Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver: By the which may be understood a <hi>Fever</hi> of the <hi>highest degree</hi>; that depends upon contumacious Obstructions, and is extraordinary dangerous: And in the next <hi>Aphorisme,</hi> he sayes, <hi>Such as are in</hi> Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers <hi>grow worse and worse if their</hi> perspiration <hi>be diverted by excessive applications of</hi> Medicines <hi>from an</hi> unskilful Physician.</p>
               <p>And so seems to be acted the first <hi>seene</hi> of a <hi>fever,</hi> which seldom proves <hi>tragical,</hi> unless by a <hi>preposterous officiousness</hi>: For by the strength of Nature alone, or by some little Art,

                  <hi>viz.</hi> By <hi>Sweating, Bleeding,</hi> and other easie means, it is for the most part brought to an happy conclusion.</p>
               <p>Unless, which very oft falls out, a <hi>Mass</hi> of <hi>crude Matter</hi> generated from the Errors in the other Non-natural things, and lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in the first wayes, as the <hi>Ventricle, Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stines, Meseraick Veins,</hi> becoming (as it is very apt to do) a <hi>fewel</hi> to this Disease make it both long and dangerous: Now this <hi>Crude Matter</hi> seems to be nothing else but the <hi>Recrements</hi> of the imperfect &amp; perfunc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious <hi>Digestion</hi> of the Stomack and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Bowels: the search therefore into the cause of such <hi>Recrements</hi> amassed up, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly lead us in relation to the discovery, first to make inquiry how perfect and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural <hi>Digestion</hi> is made.</p>

               <p>Now beside this <hi>compression</hi> and <hi>rowling</hi> of the Aliment contained in the Stomack by the <hi>Diaphragma</hi> and <hi>abdomen</hi> the chief Instruments to make the <hi>Chyle,</hi> the powr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in of certain Liquors from the <hi>Glands,</hi> to macerate the Aliment, seems likewise to cooperate to the same purpose: As also the continual <hi>influx</hi> of <hi>Spirits</hi> by the great <hi>Nerves</hi> that comes to the Stomack, seems as well the promovers of that intestine mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion bringing first <hi>Attrition,</hi> next <hi>Concocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> as they are Authors of other admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble actions in the Body done by their stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penduous <hi>Elasticity,</hi> such as the motion of the Muscles.

and clear air does contribute exceedingly both to Appetite and Digestion: And the Meat thus impregnat with the air coming to the Stomack is the fitter to be acted u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon, and volatized by the Spirits, which also are of an aereal nature, and the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits influence to <hi>Concoction</hi> is plain by this, that these that are affected with Intense Grief and Sadness, or indulge anxiety and thought fulness, by which the Spirits are diverted from the Office of <hi>Chylification,</hi> do not digest, but find a weight about their Stomack, and have likewise the other to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens of bad Digestion upon their Body, and also <hi>Appoplectick</hi> Persons do eat and digest double the quantity of Aliment that they do when they are whole; which seems to be only for this reason because the influx of the <hi>animal Spirits,</hi> being denyed throw the rest of the Nerves, takes the course more liberally throw the <hi>wandring pair and intercostal Nerves</hi> going to the Stomack &amp; Bowels (whose safety Nature studies long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est to maintain) so these places being most copiously imbued with Spirits, do perform their Actions more vegetly.

               <p>Moreover to confirm this <hi>Hypothesis</hi> of the <hi>Stomacks Digestion</hi> by gentle <hi>rowling</hi> of the contained Aliment, the benefit that in most <hi>chronick</hi> Diseases comes by long rid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing seems to be no small adminicle: For these Diseases for most part coming from <hi>crudity</hi> and the <hi>recrements</hi> of the <hi>Indigestion,</hi> which beget obstruction, by this continual motion &amp; jogging of the Body in riding, are not only removed, but actual Digesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is thereby extraordinarly promoved; and that by agitation of the contained A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liment making <hi>Atrition</hi> of the parts there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of upon one another: And what alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons <hi>motion</hi> and <hi>agitation</hi> alone is able to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce in liquids is seen in the <hi>churning</hi> of <hi>Milk,</hi> whereby <hi>Butter</hi> is made; and that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any <hi>Fermentation</hi> or <hi>Effervescence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Having thus far digressed to essay how <hi>Digestion</hi> is made; it plainly follows that <hi>Indigestion</hi> leaving the <hi>Particles</hi> of the <hi>Ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> less comminuted, attenuat, and mellowed, resolves in the <hi>Congestion</hi> of a <hi>Mass</hi> of <hi>crude Humors</hi> lodged into the first wayes, and ready to be a Fewel to begin or increase any Disease, especially a <hi>Fever,</hi>

               <p>And the first is <hi>Bleeding,</hi> which by the consent of almost all is granted to be very beneficial; but if by this <hi>Theory</hi> is be clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed how it is so, it may perhaps have its effect further improven also thereby; Now its certain that for the most part <hi>Bleeding</hi> Cooles the Body, Calmes and slackens the Pulse, and allays almost all violent <hi>Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomes?</hi> In so much that being celebrate to one in the <hi>Fury</hi> and <hi>Fever</hi> of a <hi>Drunkenness</hi> it allays that also; But how it does this is to be inquired: Its certain that the immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at effect of <hi>Blooding</hi> is the Emptying or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletion
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:106684:98"/>
of the vein that's cut, and the nixt effect to this must be that the <hi>Blood</hi> that's poured forth of the <hi>Vein</hi> that's cut, not going back to the <hi>Vena Cava</hi> or great <hi>Vein,</hi> must be in consequence a proportionable Depletion of that <hi>Vein</hi> also; Because the usual accession of Blood from that Vein cut is intercepted; Now this Ebb made in that great Vein must certainly make the rest of the Veins that feed it flow with greater Force and Quantity thereunto likewayes; Because the <hi>moment</hi> of <hi>Resistance</hi> in the great Vein thereby being less then it was, is also less then the <hi>Pressure</hi> of the Veins feeding it, which must make them empty themselves there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in with greater freedom and force then they did before. And this in consequence, diminishing the pressure of the Blood in the whole Veins which lay against the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial Blood,</hi> must make the <hi>arterial Blood</hi> from all the Arteries go into all the Veines with more freedom also: When before the whole Veins being choak full, by the <hi>resistance</hi> &amp; <hi>contranitence</hi> of the <hi>venal</hi> against the <hi>arterial Blood,</hi> the <hi>arteries</hi> emptyed themselves with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty into the <hi>veins</hi> &amp; any <hi>obstructions</hi> betwixt the <hi>Arteries</hi> &amp; <hi>Veines</hi> could not easily yield to the <hi>Pressure</hi> of the <hi>Arterial Blood</hi>; Because the <hi>Venal Blood</hi> being throng, and <hi>Regurgitating</hi>
                  <pb n="145" facs="tcp:106684:98"/>
its Resistance was equivalent to the <hi>Pressure</hi> of the <hi>Arterial Blood:</hi> And so little or no advance being made in the motion of the <hi>Arterial Blood</hi> toward the <hi>Veins,</hi> it could not sweep and clear these passages betwixt them &amp; the <hi>Veins</hi>: Not very unlike, as when a <hi>Mill-Wheell</hi> stands still and has its motion stoped by back Water, there being an equivalent weight with that which should force it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout hinging on the other side of it; But when the back Water is removed off, or falls low, then the motion goes on as before: even so it is here that any sudden <hi>Depletion</hi> of the <hi>Veins,</hi> as taking away the Resistance, gives the <hi>Arteries</hi> freedom to squirt the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial Blood</hi> more freely into the <hi>Veines</hi>; And consequently to sweep away all <hi>stopes</hi> and <hi>rubbish</hi> in the way.</p>
               <p>But it is to be observed here, that upon the opening of any <hi>Vein,</hi> this scouring of the Passages is most effectually performed in these <hi>conduits</hi> that are betwixt the <hi>Arteries</hi> and that <hi>Vein</hi>: These <hi>Arteries</hi> being first, and most sensible of the removeal of the <hi>counter Ballance</hi> that lay against them, catch the opportunity, by emptying themselves precipitantly into that Vein, to sweep pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfully the <hi>interjacent Passages.</hi>

As also it occurrs here to be observed, that for the self same reason the <hi>Arterial</hi> Blood, thô it make no faster advance from the Heart, then the <hi>Venal</hi> makes its return to it; and also althô it be more <hi>spirituous</hi> and <hi>volatile</hi> then the <hi>Venal</hi>; Yet it needs the help of Pulsation to carry it on which the <hi>Venal</hi> needs not: The reason of this seems to be the same different structure of these
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:106684:101"/>
Vessels in respect of the Bloods motion in them: For the <hi>Arterial Blood</hi> making its progress; as is said, always from a wider place of the <hi>Arterie</hi> unto a narrower, needs the force of the Pulse to drive it foreward: But the <hi>Venal</hi> contrarywayes moving from a narrower place of the <hi>Vein</hi> into a broader, is served with less force; the <hi>contraction</hi> of the Coats of the <hi>Vessels,</hi> with the help of Respiration at every turn pressing on the great <hi>Veins</hi> within the Trunk of the Body, and the Valves hindering its return, is sufficient alone to carry it back to the <hi>heart.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is moreover another Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite to be remarked in <hi>Phlebotomy,</hi> beside the simple depletion of the <hi>Veins</hi> and the former beneficial consequence thereof,<note place="margin">The reason why the worst <hi>Blood</hi> is first evacuated.</note> &amp; that is this, if the <hi>Vessels</hi> or the <hi>Arteries</hi> situated beyond the Orifice made in the <hi>Vein,</hi> do contain any <hi>Labefacted, Rheumatick,</hi> or <hi>Purulent Blood,</hi> such is most part voided; the more opime and pure being retained: The reason of this <hi>Phoeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menon</hi> appears to be thus, when the <hi>circuit</hi> of the <hi>Blood</hi> is not throwly perfected, many of the <hi>Globuls</hi> or <hi>Particles</hi> thereof, stagnat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing become <hi>torpid</hi> and <hi>purulent,</hi> and such for the most part are accumulat toward the

               <p>Now as to these <hi>Phaenomena</hi> which are hurtful in <hi>Fevers,</hi> it is no less certain that these being duely pondered, will also con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm this <hi>Hypothesis,</hi> for it is clear that in many <hi>Fevers</hi> the sick are poured forth all in <hi>Sweats</hi>; And that without any ease there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, but rather with great hurt and weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening: Therefore as our experimented

               <p>Now this <hi>Phaenomenon</hi> may be easily sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, by considering that the <hi>serosity</hi> of the <hi>Blood</hi> is in this case, by the frequent Pulses squeezed out from the <hi>Globuls,</hi> whereby the <hi>Blood</hi> being much thickned, the obstructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are increassed: while Sweats called <hi>criti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call</hi> and giving ease (which rarely fall out in long and great <hi>Fevers</hi>: Because these are nourished of a <hi>copious</hi> and <hi>viscide fewel</hi> in the first wayes:) fall out in diseases only caus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by perspirable matter first <hi>attenuat</hi> and <hi>comminuted</hi> and nixt <hi>expelled</hi> by <hi>Sweat,</hi> and as this <hi>evacuation,</hi> is altogether the effect of Nature, so it rarely succeeds happily by stimulating Medicines: Which after its wisely argued, is most reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly concluded by <hi>Sydenham</hi> in his <hi>Schedula Monitoria.</hi>

               <p>And indeed that the <hi>Blood</hi> receives its outmost perfection in the <hi>Lungs,</hi> and not in the Heart; As is commonly accounted, is clear from this, that the <hi>Blood</hi> which is sent from the right <hi>Ventricle</hi> of the Heart by

               <p>IF the addition of these things that are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient, and the substraction of those that are exuberant, be daily made as to Quantity and Quality such as it ought to be; lost Health would be recovered, and the present preserved.</p>
               <p n="2">II. If the <hi>Physician</hi> be only capable of judging the sensible Addition and Evacua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and knows not to regulate the insen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible Perspiration; he does not Cure, but deceives his Patients.</p>

                  <pb n="116" facs="tcp:106684:122" rendition="simple:additions"/>III. If the Aliment taken in one day amounts to eight pound weight, the <hi>insensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Perspiration</hi> amounts to five pound, or thereabout; yet there is some variety there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in according to the diversity of <hi>Natures, Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mats, Seasons, Age, Aliment,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. And this may be easily computed having weighed the Aliments taken in by sitting in the Chair, having duly placed the Weight: then weighing the Body the nixt morning before and after sensible <hi>Excretion</hi>: The weight of the sensible being only found to come to three pound or thereby, the rest being five must of necessity go by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sensible <hi>Perspiration.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">V. This insensible <hi>Perspiration</hi> is made throw the <hi>Pores</hi> of the Body, which are <hi>transpirable</hi> in all its parts: Or by respiration performed by the Mouth coming out with the breath, which commonly amounts to half a pound a day.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. What quantity of <hi>perspiration</hi> is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient for every One in order to continue his Health may be found out thus, obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in the Morning after a somewhat plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful Supper over Night what the <hi>Perspiration</hi> in the space of twelve hours comes to, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose it comes to 50 Ounces, then another Morning after Fasting over Night, but with
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:106684:123"/>
this condition, that thou didst not exceed at Dinner the day before, make the same observation, as suppose the <hi>Perspiration</hi> to have amounted to 20 Ounces: So having made these observations, pitch upon that proportion of Meat and other Non-natural causes which may reduce the perspiration to the mean betwixt 50 and 20 Ounces, and that will be 35 ounces: thus mayest thou live a long and healthful life, and happily an hundred years.</p>
               <p n="7">VII. The weight of the body being aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented without increasing the aliment, or the retention of the sensible excrements, is a sign of wanting <hi>perspiration.</hi>

               <p n="9">IX. Plenty of <hi>perspiration,</hi> and much sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible evacuations are inconsistent together: and copious sensible <hi>evacuations</hi> with <hi>perspira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> deficient are evil.</p>
               <p n="10">X. That weight of the Body is the stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard of health, when one can ascend a steep place with ease.</p>
               <p n="11">XI. The weight of the Body is dimini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed by the evacuation either of <hi>sensible</hi> or <hi>insensible</hi> crude matter, or by sensible

or <hi>insensible</hi> concocted Matter: The latter conduces to health; and the former takes away the <hi>Excess,</hi> but leaves an evil quality behind.</p>
               <p n="12">XII. Insensible <hi>Perspiration</hi> attended with sweating is not good, because sweating a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates the strength of the <hi>Fibres</hi>: Yet it may be accounted good in respect it ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
