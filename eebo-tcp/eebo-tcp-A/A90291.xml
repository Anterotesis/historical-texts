            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            </epigraph>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the firſt Chapters of this Epiſtle,
the Apoſtle from Scripture, and
the conſtant practice of all ſorts
of men, of all Ages, <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,
Wiſe</hi> and <hi>Barbarians,</hi> proves
all the world, and every indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual
therein, to have <hi>ſinned and
come ſhort of the glory of God:</hi> And
not only ſo, but that it was utterly impoſſible, that by
their own ſtrength, or by virtue of any aſſiſtance com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated,
or priviledges enjoyed, they ſhould ever
attain to a <hi>righteouſneſs of their own,</hi> that might be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable
unto God.</p>
            <pb n="2" facs="tcp:165610:4"/>
            <p>Hereupon he concludes that Diſcourſe with theſe
two poſitive Aſſertions:</p>
            <p>1 <hi>That for what is paſt,</hi> every mouth muſt be ſtopped, and
all the world become guilty before God. <hi>Chap. 3. v.</hi> 19.</p>
            <p>2 For the <hi>future,</hi> though they ſhould labour to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
their wayes, and improve their Aſſiſtances and
Priviledges to a better advantage then formerly, <hi>yet by
the deeds of the Law, ſhall no fleſh be juſtified in the ſight of
God.</hi> v. 20.</p>
            <p>Now it being the main drift of the Apoſtle, in this
Epiſtle, and in his whole Employment, to manifeſt
that God hath not ſhut up all the Sons of men, hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
and remedileſs under this Condition; he imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly,
diſcovers and opens the rich Supply, which
God in Free-grace hath made and provided, for the
delivery of his Own from this calamitous eſtate, even
by the <hi>Righteouſneſs of Faith in Chriſt,</hi> which he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foldeth,
aſſerteth, proves, and vindicates from Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections
to the <hi>end of the</hi> 3<hi rend="sup">d</hi> 
               <hi>Chapter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This being a matter of ſo great weight, as, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing
in it ſelf the ſumme of the Goſpel wherewith
he was entruſted; the honor and exaltation of Chriſt,
which above all he deſired; the great deſign of God
to be glorious in his Saints, and in a word, the chief
ſubject of the <hi>Ambaſſage</hi> from Chriſt, to him commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
(to wit, That they who neither have, nor by any
means can attain a <hi>Righteouſneſs of their own,</hi> by the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
of their workings, may yet have that which is
compleat and unrefuſable in Chriſt, by beleiving) he
therefore ſtrongly confirms it in the <hi>fourth Chapter,</hi> by
teſtimony and example of the Scripture, with the
Saints that were of old: Thereby alſo declaring, That
though the manifeſtation of this Myſtery, were now
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:165610:4"/>
more fully opened by Chriſt <hi>from the boſome of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi>
yet indeed this was the only way for any to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
in the preſence of God, ever ſince Sin entred into
the world.</p>
            <p>To make his Demonſtrations the more evident, he
ſingleth out <hi>one</hi> for an example, who was eminently
known, and confeſſed by all to have been the <hi>friend of
God,</hi> to have been <hi>righteous</hi> and <hi>juſtified</hi> before him, and
thereon to have held ſweet Communion with him all
his dayes; to wit, <hi>Abraham,</hi> the <hi>father according to the
fleſh,</hi> of all thoſe, who put in the ſtrongeſt of all men
for a ſhare in Righteouſneſs, by the Priviledges they
did enjoy, and the works they did perform.</p>
            <p>Now concerning him, the Apoſtle proves abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in the beginning of the <hi>fourth Chapter,</hi> That the Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
which he found, and the Righteouſneſs he at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained,
was purely that, and no other, which he before
deſcribed; to wit, a Righteouſneſs in <hi>the forgiveneſs of
Sins, through Faith in the blood of Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yea, and that all the priviledges and exaltations of
this <hi>Abraham,</hi> which made him ſo ſignal and eminent
among the Saints of God, as to be called the <hi>Father of
the faithful,</hi> were meerly from hence, That this Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe
of Grace, was freely diſcovered, and fully
eſtabliſhed unto him: an Enjoyment being granted him
in a peculiar manner, by Faith, of that promiſe, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the Lord Chriſt with the whole ſpring of the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſnes
mentioned, was enwrapped.</p>
            <p>This the Apoſtle purſues with ſundry and various
Inferences, and Concluſions, to the <hi>end of Verſ. 17. Chap.</hi> 4</p>
            <p>Having laid down this, in the next place he gives
us a Deſcription of that <hi>Faith of Abraham,</hi> whereby he
became Inheritor of thoſe excellent things, from the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:165610:5"/>
               <hi>Adjuncts</hi> of it. That as his <hi>Juſtification</hi> was propoſed as
an Example of Gods dealing with us by his Grace, ſo
his <hi>Faith</hi> might be laid down as a pattern for us, in the
receiving that Grace.</p>
            <p>Now this he
doth, from
<list>
                  <item>1 The foundation of it, whereon it reſted.</item>
                  <item>2 The matter of it, what he believed.</item>
                  <item>3 The manner of it, or how he believed.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>1, <hi>From the bottome and foundation on which it reſted,</hi> viz.
The Omnipotency or Al-ſufficiency of God, whereby
he was able to fulfil whatever he had engaged himſelf
unto by promiſe, and which he called him to believe,
<hi>verſ. 14. He believed him who quickneth the dead, and calleth
thoſe things which be not, as though they were.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Two great Teſtimonies are here of the power of
God: 1 That <hi>he quickneth the dead,</hi> able he is to raiſe up
thoſe that are dead to life again. 2 <hi>He calleth things that
are not, as though they were:</hi> by his very <hi>call</hi> or <hi>word,</hi> gives
being to thoſe things which before were not: as when
he ſaid, <hi>Let there be light, there was light,</hi> Gen. 1. 3. by that
very word, <hi>commanding light to ſhine out of darkneſs,</hi>
2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 6.</p>
            <p>Theſe Demonſtrations of Gods Al-ſufficiency he
conſidereth in peculiar reference to what he was to
believe; to wit, That <hi>he might be the Father of many Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi>
verſ. 11. of the <hi>Jews</hi> according <hi>to the fleſh,</hi> of <hi>Jews</hi>
and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> according to the <hi>Faith</hi> whereof we ſpeak.</p>
            <p>1 For the firſt, his <hi>Body being now dead, and Sarahs
wombe dead, verſ.</hi> 19. he reſts on God <hi>as quickening the
dead,</hi> in believing that he <hi>ſhall be the father of many Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2 For the other, that he ſhould be a Father of the
Gentiles by Faith, the holy Ghoſt witneſſeth that they
<hi>were not a people,</hi> Hoſ. 2. 23. the implanting of them in
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:165610:5"/>
his ſtock, muſt be by a power, <hi>that calleth things that are
not, as though they were:</hi> giving <hi>a new nature,</hi> and <hi>being</hi>
unto them, which before they had not.</p>
            <p>To bottome our ſelves upon the Al-ſufficiency of God, for the
accompliſhment of ſuch things, as are altogether impoſſible to
any thing, but that Alſufficiency, is faith indeed, and worthy
our immitation: <hi>It is alſo the wiſdome of Faith, to
pitch peculiarly on that in God, which is accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to the difficulties wherewith it is to wreſtle: Is</hi>
Abraham <hi>to believe, That from</hi> his dead body, muſt ſpringe
a whole Nation? <hi>he reſts on God, as</hi> he that quickeneth the
dead.</p>
            <p>2, His Faith is commended from the <hi>matter of it, or
what he did believe:</hi> which is ſaid in general to be <hi>the
promiſe of God:</hi> verſe 20. <hi>He ſtaggered not at the promiſe
of God through unbelief.</hi> And particularly the matter of
that promiſe is pointed at, <hi>verſ.</hi> 11. 18. that he ſhould
be <hi>the father of many Nations;</hi> that was his being a <hi>father
of many nations,</hi> of having <hi>all nations bleſſed in his ſeed.</hi> A
matter entangled with a world of difficulties, conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the natural inability of his Body, and the Body of
<hi>Sarah,</hi> to be Parents of Children</p>
            <p>When God calls for believing, his Truth and Alſufficiency
being ingaged, no difficulty nor ſeeming impoſſibilities, that
the thing to be believed is, or may be attended withal, ought to
be of any weight with us: he who hath promiſed, is able.</p>
            <p>3, From the <hi>manner of his believing,</hi> which is expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<hi>Four wayes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1 <hi>Againſt Hope, he believed in Hope:</hi> verſe 18. Here is
a twofold <hi>Hope</hi> mentioned, <hi>one</hi> that was <hi>againſt</hi> him, the
<hi>other,</hi> that was <hi>for</hi> him.</p>
            <p>1 He <hi>believed againſt Hope,</hi> that is, when all Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
that might beget Hope in him, were <hi>againſt</hi> him.</p>
            <pb n="6" facs="tcp:165610:6"/>
            <p>
               <hi>againſt Hope,</hi> is againſt all motives unto Hope whatever.
All Reaſons of natural hope were <hi>againſt him:</hi> What
<hi>Hope</hi> could ariſe, in, or by Reaſon, that <hi>two dead Bodies,</hi>
ſhould be the Source and Fountain of <hi>many Nations?</hi>
ſo that againſt all inducements of a natural Hope he
believed.</p>
            <p>2 <hi>He believed in Hope:</hi> That is ſuch <hi>Hope</hi> as aroſe as
his Faith <hi>did</hi> from the conſideration of Gods Alſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency;
this is an <hi>Adjunct</hi> of his Faith, it was ſuch a
Faith as had Hope adjoyned with it: And this <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
in Hope,</hi> when all Reaſons of Hope were away,
is the firſt thing that is ſet down, of the <hi>manner of his
Faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In a decay of all Natural helps, the deadneſs of all meanes, an
appearance of an utter Impoſſibility, that ever the promiſe
ſhould be accompliſhed, then to believe with unfeigned Hope, is
a commendable Faith.</p>
            <p>2 <hi>He was not weak in faith:</hi> verſ. 19. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>not
weak,</hi> is the 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> thing. <hi>Minime debilis:</hi> Beza. He was
by <hi>no means weak.</hi> A negation, that by a figure (<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>)
doth ſtrongly aſſert the contrary, to that which is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied.
He was <hi>no way weak;</hi> that is, He was very <hi>ſtrong
in Faith,</hi> as is afterwards expreſſed, <hi>verſ. 20. He was ſtrong
in Faith giving glory to God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And the Apoſtle tells you, wherein this his, <hi>not weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi>
did appear: ſaith he, <hi>He conſidered not his own body
being now dead, when he was about an hundred yeers old, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
yet the deadneſs of Sara's wombe:</hi> verſe 19. It was ſeen
in this, that his Faith carried him above the conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of all impediments, that might lie in the way to
the accompliſhment of the promiſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>It is meer weakneſs of Faith, that makes a man lye poering
on the difficulties and ſeeming impoſſibilities that lye upon the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:165610:6"/>
promiſe.</hi> We think it our wiſdome, and our ſtrength,
to conſider, weigh and look into the bottome of
oppoſitions, and temptations, that ariſe againſt the
Promiſe. Perhaps it may be the ſtrength of our
fleſhly, carnal Reaſon; but certainly, it is the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of our Faith: He that is <hi>ſtrong in Faith,</hi> will not
ſo much as debate or conſider the things, that caſt the
greateſt ſeeming improbability, yea impoſſibility, on
the fulfilling of the promiſe. It will not afford them
a Debate or Diſpute of the Cauſe, nor any conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<hi>being not weak in Faith, he conſidered not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3 <hi>He was fully perſwaded,</hi> verſe 21. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, he
was <hi>perſuaſionis plenus, fully perſwaded:</hi> this is the 3<hi rend="sup">d</hi> thing
that is obſerved in the <hi>manner of his believing.</hi> He fully,
quietly, reſolvedly caſt himſelf on this, That <hi>he who
had promiſed was able to performe it.</hi> As a Ship at Sea, (for
ſo the word imports) looking about, and ſeeing
ſtorms and winds ariſing, ſets up all her Sayles, and
with all ſpeed, makes to the Harbour. <hi>Abraham</hi> ſeeing
the ſtorms of doubts and temptations, likely to riſe
againſt the Promiſe made unto him, with full ſayl
breaks through all, to lie down quietly in Gods Al-ſufficiency.
And this is the 3<hi rend="sup">d</hi>.</p>
            <p>4 The 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> is, That <hi>he ſtaggered not,</hi> verſe 20. This is
that which I have choſen to inſiſt on unto you, as a
choice part of the commendation of <hi>Abraham's</hi> faith,
which is propoſed for our imitation:</p>
            <p>He ſtaggered not at the promiſe of God through unbelief.</p>
            <p>The words may be briefly reſolved into this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrinal
Propoſition:</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Obſ."/> All ſtaggering at the promiſes of God is from unbelief.</p>
            <p>What is of any difficulty in the Text, will be cleer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in opening the parts of the Obſervation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:165610:7"/>
Men are apt to pretend ſundry other Reaſons and
Cauſes of their ſtaggering. The Promiſes do not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
unto them, God intends not their ſouls in them,
they are not ſuch, and ſuch, and this makes them
<hi>ſtagger:</hi> when the Truth is, it is their <hi>unbelief,</hi> and
that alone, that puts them into this ſtaggering condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
As in other things, ſo in this, we are apt to have
many fair pretences for foul faults. To lay the Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
on the right ſhoulders, I ſhall demonſtrate by
Gods aſſiſtance, that it is not this, or that, but <hi>unbelief</hi>
alone, that makes us ſtagger at the Promiſes.</p>
            <p>To make this the more plain, I muſt open theſe
two things:
<list>
                  <item>1 What is the Promiſe here intended?</item>
                  <item>2 What it is, to ſtagger at the Promiſe?</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>The promiſe here mentioned is principally that
which <hi>Abraham</hi> believing, it was ſaid eminently, That
it <hi>was accounted to him for Righteouſneſs:</hi> So the Apoſtle
tells us, <hi>verſe 5. of this Chaper:</hi> when this was, you may
ſee <hi>Gen. 15. verſ.</hi> 6. there it is affirmed, That <hi>he believed
the Lord, and it was accounted to him for Righteouſneſs.</hi> That
which God had there ſpoken to him of, was about
<hi>the multiplying of his ſeed as the ſtars of heaven, whereas he
was yet childleſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>laſt verſe of Chapter</hi> 14, leaves <hi>Abraham</hi> full of
earthly Glory. He had newly conquered five Kings
with all their hoſt: honoured by the King of <hi>Sodom,</hi>
and bleſſed by the King of <hi>Salem;</hi> and yet in the <hi>firſt
verſe of Chap.</hi> 15. God <hi>appearing to him in a viſion,</hi> in the
very entrance bids him FEAR NOT: plainly intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
That notwithſtanding all his outward ſucceſſe
and glory, he had ſtill many perplexities upon his
Spirit, and had need of great Conſolation and eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment:
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:165610:7"/>
               <hi>Abraham</hi> was not cleer in the accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of former Promiſes about the <hi>bleſſed ſeed,</hi> and
ſo though he have all outward advancements, yet he
cannot reſt in them. Until a child of God be cleer
in the main, in the matter of the great Promiſe, the
buſineſs of Chriſt, the greateſt outward Succeſſes and
Advantages, will be ſo far from quieting and ſettling
his mind, that they rather increaſe his perplexities.
They do but occaſion him to cry, Here is this, and
that; here is victory, and ſucceſs; here is wealth,
and peace; but here is not Chriſt.</p>
            <p>That this was <hi>Abraham's</hi> condition, appears from
<hi>verſ. 2. of that Chapter,</hi> where God having told him,
That <hi>he was his ſheild, and his exceeding great reward.</hi> He
replyes, <hi>Lord God, what wilt thou give me, ſeeing I go child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs?</hi>
As if he ſhould have ſaid, Lord God, thou toldeſt
me when I was in <hi>Haran,</hi> now 19. years ago, That in
me and <hi>my ſeed, all the families of the Earth ſhould be bleſſed,
Gen.</hi> 12. 3. That the bleſſed, bleſſing ſeed, ſhould be
of me: but now I wax old, all appearances grow up
againſt the direct accompliſhment of that word, and
it was that, which above all in following thee, I aimed
at; if I am diſappointed therein, what ſhall I do?
and what will all theſe things avail me? what will it
benefit me, to have a multitude of earthly enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and leave them in the cloſe to my Servant?</p>
            <p>I cannot but obſerve, That this ſighing mournful
complaint of <hi>Abraham,</hi> hath much infirmity, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of diffidence, mixed with it. He ſhakes in the
very bottom of his ſoul, that improbabilities were
growing up as he thought to impoſſibilities, againſt
him, in the way of the Promiſe: Yet hence alſo mark
theſe two things:</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:165610:8"/>
1 That he doth not repine in himſelf, and keep
up his burning thoughts in his breſt, but ſweetly
breaths out the burden of his Soul, into the boſome
of his God: <hi>Lord God,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>what wilt thou give
me ſeeing I go childleſs? It is of ſincere Faith, to unlade our
unbeleif, in the boſome of our God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2 That God takes not his Servant at the Advantage
of his complaining and diffidence: but lets that paſs,
until having renewed the Promiſe to him, and ſettled
his Faith, then he gives in his Teſtimony, That he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leived
God. <hi>The Lord overlooks the weakneſs, and cauſleſs
wailings of his, takes them at the beſt, and then gives his wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſse
to them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This I ſay was the Promiſe whereof we ſpake,
That he ſhould have <hi>a ſeed of his own, like the ſtars that
cannot be numbered,</hi> Gen. 15. <hi>v.</hi> 4, 5. And herein are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
Three things.</p>
            <p>1 The purely ſpiritual part of it, that concerned his
own ſoul in Chriſt. God ingaging about his ſeed,
minds him of his own Intereſt, in the bleſſing bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſeed. Jeſus Chriſt, with his whol Mediation, and
his whole work of Redemption is in this Promiſe,
with the enjoyment of God in Covenant, <hi>as a ſheild,
and as an exceeding great Reward.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2 The kingdom of Chriſt in reſpect of the Propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
and Eſtabliſhment of it, with the multitude of
his ſubjects, that alſo is in this Promiſe.</p>
            <p>3 The temporal part of it, multitudes of Children
to a Childleſs man: and an <hi>Heir from his own bowels.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now this Promiſe in theſe 3 Branches, takes up your
whole Intereſt, comprizes all you are to beleive for:
be you conſidered, either as <hi>Beleivers,</hi> or as <hi>Rulers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1 As <hi>Beleivers:</hi> So your Intereſt lies in theſe Two
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:165610:8"/>
things: 1 That your own ſouls have a ſhare and por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in the Lord Chriſt: 2 That the kingdom of the
Lord Jeſus be exalted and eſtabliſhed.</p>
            <p>2 As <hi>Rulers:</hi> That peace and proſperity may be the
inheritance of the Nation, is in your deſires: look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this in ſubordination to the kingdom of Chriſt, and
ſo all there are in this Promiſe.</p>
            <p>To make this more plain, theſe being the Three
main things that you ayme at; I ſhall lay before you
Three Promiſes, ſuted to theſe ſeveral things, which
or the like, you are too view in all your actings, <hi>all
ſtaggering at them, being from unbelief.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1, The firſt thing you are to beleive for, is the
Intereſt of your own ſouls in the Covenant of Grace,
by Chriſt: as to this I ſhall only point unto that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
of the Covenant, <hi>Heb. 8. 12. I will be merciful to tbeir
unrigbteouſneſs, and their ſins, and their iniquities, I will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
no more.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2, <hi>The ſecond is the eſtabliſhment of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of Chriſt, in deſpite of all oppoſition: and for
this amongſt innumerable, take that of</hi> Iſa. 60. 11.
Therefore thy Gates ſhall be open continually, they ſhall not be
ſhut day nor night, that men may bring unto thee the forces of
the Gentiles, and that their Kings may be brought; for the
Nation and Kingdom that will not ſerve thee, ſhall periſh.</p>
            <p>3, The quiet and peace of the Nation, which
ye regard as Rulers, as it ſtands in ſubordination to
the kingdom of Chriſt, comes alſo under the Promiſe,
for which take that of <hi>Jeremiah</hi> 30. 20, 21.</p>
            <p>Theſe being your three main ayms, let your eye be
fixed on theſe three, or the like Promiſes; for in the
Demonſtration and the Uſe of the Point, I ſhall carry
along all Three together: deſiring that what is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanced
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:165610:9"/>
in any one, may be alwayes extended to both
the other.</p>
            <p>2 What is it to <hi>ſtagger at the Promiſe:</hi> He ſtaggered
not. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> he diſputed not; <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> is proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to make uſe of our own Judgement and Reaſon,
in diſcerning of things, of what ſort they be. It is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
rendred, <hi>to doubt; Matth. 21. 21. If you have faith</hi>
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>and doubt not;</hi> that is, not uſe ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guings
and reaſonings in your ſelves concerning the
Promiſe and things promiſed. Sometimes it ſimply
denotes to diſcern a thing as it is: ſo the word is uſed
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 29. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> diſcerning the body.</p>
            <p>In the ſenſe wherein it is here uſed, as alſo <hi>Matth.</hi>
21. 21. it holds out, as I ſaid, <hi>a ſelf-conſultation and diſpute,</hi>
concerning thoſe contrary things that are propoſed to
us. So alſo <hi>Acts 10. 20. Peter</hi> is commanded to obey the
Viſion, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>nothing doubting:</hi> What is
that? Why, a not continuing to do, what he is ſaid to
have done, <hi>verſe 17. He doubted in himſelf, what the Viſion
he had ſeen ſhould mean:</hi> He rolled, and diſputed it in his
own thoughts, <hi>he ſtaggered at it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>To ſtagger then at the Promiſe,</hi> is to take into Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
the Promiſe it ſelf, and withal, all the difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
that lie in the way for the accompliſhment of it,
as to a mans own particular, and there ſo to diſpute it
in his thoughts, as not fully to caſt it off, nor fully to
cloſe with it. For Inſtance, The Soul conſiders the
Promiſe of Free-grace in the bloud of Jeſus, looks
upon it, weighs as well as it is able, the Truth of God,
who makes the Promiſe, with thoſe other conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
which might lead the heart to reſt firmly upon
it; but withal, takes into his thoughts, his own un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthineſs,
ſinfulneſs, unbelief, hypocriſie, and the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:165610:9"/>
like; which as he ſuppoſes, powerfully ſtave off the
Efficacy of the Promiſe from him. Hence he knows not
what to conclude: if he ad a <hi>grain of faith,</hi> the ſcale turns
on the ſide of the Promiſe; the like quantity of <hi>unbelief,</hi>
makes it turn upon him: &amp; what to do he knows not:
let go the Promiſe he cannot, take faſt hold he dares
not; but here he <hi>ſtaggers</hi> and wavers to and fro.</p>
            <p>Thus the Soul becomes to be like <hi>Paul,</hi> in another
caſe, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 23. He conſidered his own Advantage on
the one ſide by his <hi>diſſolution,</hi> and the profit of the
Churches by his <hi>abiding in the fleſh,</hi> on the other; and
taking in theſe various thoughts, he cryes out, He is in
<hi>a ſtraight,</hi> he <hi>ſtaggered,</hi> he was betwixt two, and knew
not which to chuſe: or as <hi>David,</hi> 2 Sam. 24. 14. when
he had a tender of ſeveral Corrections made to him,
ſayes, <hi>I am in a great ſtraight;</hi> he ſees evil in every one,
and knows not which to chuſe.</p>
            <p>A poor creature looking upon the Promiſe ſees, as
he ſuppoſes, in a ſtedfaſt cloſing with the Promiſe,
that there lyes preſumption; on the other hand, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
deſtruction, if he beleives not: and now he <hi>ſtag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,</hi>
he is in a great ſtraight: Arguments ariſe on both
ſides, he knows not how to determine them, and ſo
hanging in ſuſpenſe, he <hi>ſtaggereth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Like a man travailing a Journey, and meeting with
two ſeveral paths, that promiſe both fairly, and he
knows not which is his proper way; he gheſſes, and
gheſſes, and at length cryes, Well, I know not which
of theſe wayes I ſhould go, but this is certain, if I
miſtake, I am undone, I'le go in neither, but here I'le ſit
down, and not move one ſtep in either of them, until
ſome one come, that can give me direction. The Sonl
very frequently ſits down in this haeſitation, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſes
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:165610:10"/>
to ſtep one ſtep forwards, till God come mighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and lead out the Spirit to the Promiſe, or the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
turn it aſide to unbeleif.</p>
            <p>It is, as a thing of ſmall weight in the Air: the
weight that it hath, carries it downwards; and the
Air, with ſome breath of wind, bears it up again: ſo
that it waves to and fro: ſometimes it ſeems as though
it would fall, by it's own weight, and ſometimes again,
as though it would mount quite out of ſight, but
poyzed between both, it toſſeth up and down, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any great gaining either way.</p>
            <p>The Promiſe, that draws the Soul upward, and the
weight of its unbelief, that ſinks it downward: ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
the Promiſe attracts ſo powerfully, you would
think the heart quite drawn up into it: and ſometime
again, unbelief preſſes down, that you would think it
gon for ever; but neither prevails utterly, the poor
Creatures ſwaggs between both, this it is <hi>to ſtagger:</hi>
like the two Diſciples going to <hi>Emaus,</hi> Luke 24. <hi>v.</hi> 14.
<hi>They talked together of the things that were happned:</hi> deba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the buſineſſe: and <hi>verſe</hi> 22. they gave up the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult
of their thoughts; <hi>They truſted it had been he that
ſhould have redemed Iſrael.</hi> They truſted once, but now
ſeeing him ſlain and crucified, they know not what to
ſay to it: What then? do they quite give over all
truſting in him? No, they cannot do ſo, <hi>verſe</hi> 23, 24, 25.
<hi>Certain Women had aſtoniſhed them, and affirmed that he was
riſen:</hi> yea, and <hi>others alſo going to his grave found it ſo:</hi>
hereupon they <hi>have communication within themſelves, and
are ſad,</hi> verſe 17. that is, they <hi>ſtaggered;</hi> they were in a
ſtaggering condition: much appears for them, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
againſt them, they know not what to do.</p>
            <p>A poor ſoul that hath been long perplext in trouble
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:165610:10"/>
and anxiety of mind, finds a ſweet promiſe, Chriſt in
a promiſe ſuted to all his wants, coming with Mercy
to pardon him, with Love to embrace him, with Bloud
to purge him, and is raiſed up to roll himſelf in ſome
meaſure upon this Promiſe: On a ſuddain, Terrors
ariſe, Temptations grow ſtrong, new Corruptions
break out, Chriſt in the Promiſe dies to him, Chriſt
in the Promiſe is ſlain, is in the grave as to him; ſo
that he can only ſigh and ſay, I truſted for deliverance
by Chriſt, but now all is gone again, I have little or
no hope, Chriſt in the Promiſe is ſlain to me: What
then? ſhall he give over, never more enquire after
this buried Chriſt, but ſit down in darkneſſe and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row?
No, he cannot do ſo: This morning, ſome new
Arguments of Chriſts appearance again upon the
Soul, are made out: it may be, Chriſt is not for ever
loſt to him. What does he then? ſtedfaſtly believe
he cannot; totally give over he will not: He ſtaggers:
he is full of ſelf-communications and is ſad. This it is,
to <hi>ſtagger at the promiſe of God.</hi> I come now to prove,
That notwithſtanding any pretences whatever, <hi>All this
ſtaggering is from unbelief.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The two Diſciples whom we now mentioned that
<hi>ſtaggered</hi> and diſputed between themſelves in their
Journey to <hi>Emaus,</hi> thought they had a goodly Reaſon,
and a ſufficient appearing Cauſe of all their doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings:
<hi>We hoped</hi> (ſay they) <hi>that it was he, that ſhould have
delivered Iſrael.</hi> What do they now ſtand at? Alaſs! the
<hi>chief Prieſts and Rulers have condemned him to death, and
Crucified him,</hi> Luke 24. 20. And is it poſſible that deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance
ſhould ariſe from a Crucified man? This
makes them ſtagger. But when our Saviour himſelf
draws nigh to them, and gives them the ground of all
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:165610:11"/>
this, he tells them it is all from hence; <hi>they are fooliſh
and ſlow of heart to believe,</hi> verſe 25. Here is the riſe of
all their doubtings, even their unbelief. Whilſt you
are <hi>ſlow of heart to believe,</hi> do not once think of eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Peter</hi> venturing upon the waves at the command of
Chriſt, <hi>Matth.</hi> 14. ſeing the <hi>winde to grow boyſtrous,</hi> v. 29.
he alſo hath a ſtorm within, and crys out, <hi>Oh ſave me:</hi>
What was now the Cauſe of <hi>Peter's</hi> fear, and crying
out? why the Wind and Sea grew boyſterous, and
he was ready to ſink: no ſuch thing; but meerly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief,
want of Faith: <hi>verſe 31. O thou of little Faith</hi>
(ſaith our Saviour) <hi>wherefore diddeſt thou doubt?</hi> it was
not the great winds, but thy <hi>little Faith</hi> that made thee
<hi>ſtagger.</hi> And in three or four other places, upon ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
occaſions, doth our Saviour lay all the wavering
and ſtaggering of his followers, as to any promiſed
mercy, upon this ſcore, as <hi>Matth.</hi> 6. 30. and 8. 26.</p>
            <p>Iſa. 7. <hi>Ahaz</hi> being afraid of the Combination of <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria</hi>
and <hi>Ephraim</hi> againſt him, received a promiſe of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance
by <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> verſe 7. whereupon the Prophet
tells him and all <hi>Judah,</hi> That <hi>if they will not believe, ſurely
they ſhall not be eſtabliſhed, verſe</hi> 9. He doth not ſay, If
<hi>Damaſcus</hi> and <hi>Ephraim</hi> be not broken, you ſhall not be
eſtabliſhed; no, the ſtick is not there: The fear that
you will not be eſtabliſhed, ariſeth meerly from your
<hi>unbelief,</hi> that keeps you off from cloſing with the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe,
which would certainly bring you eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>And this is the ſole Reaſon the Apoſtle gives, why
the word of Promiſe being Preached, becomes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable;
even becauſe of unbelief: <hi>It was not mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with faith,</hi> Heb. 4. 2.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:165610:11"/>
But theſe things will be more cleer under the
Demonſtrations of the Point; which are
Two:</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1. Dem."/> When a man doubts, haeſitates and diſputes any
thing in himſelf, his Reaſonings muſt have their Riſe,
either from ſomething within himſelf, or from ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
in the things concerning which he ſtaggereth:
Either <hi>Certitudo mentis,</hi> the aſſurance of his mind, or
<hi>Certitudo entis,</hi> the certainty of the thing it ſelf, is
wanting.</p>
            <p>He that doubteth whether his friend in a far country
be alive or no, his ſtaggering ariſeth from the uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
of the thing it ſelf: when that is made out, he is
reſolved, as it was with <hi>Jacob</hi> in the Caſe of <hi>Joſeph.</hi> But
he that doubteth, whether the Needl in the Compaſs,
being touched with the Loadſtone, will turn North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward;
all the uncertainty is in his own mind.</p>
            <p>When men <hi>ſtagger at the Promiſes,</hi> this muſt ariſe ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
from within themſelves, or ſome occaſion muſt
be adminiſtred hereunto, from the Promiſe. If from
within themſelves, that can be nothing but unbelief;
an in-bred obſtacle to cloſing with, and reſting on the
Promiſe, that is unbelief. If then we demonſtrate,
that there is nothing in the Promiſe, either as to the
<hi>matter,</hi> or <hi>manner,</hi> or any <hi>attendency</hi> of it, that ſhould
occaſion any ſuch <hi>ſtaggering,</hi> then we lay the burden
and blame on the right ſhoulders, <hi>the ſin of ſtaggering
on unbelief.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now that any Occaſion is not adminiſtred, nor
Cauſe given, of this ſtaggering, from the Promiſe,
will appear, if we conſider ſeriouſly whence any ſuch
Occaſion or Cauſe ſhould ariſe. All the ſtability of a
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:165610:12"/>
Promiſe, depends upon the Qualifications of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſer,
to the ends and purpoſes of the promiſe. If
a man make me a Promiſe to do ſuch and ſuch things
for me, and I queſtion, whether ever it will be ſo, or
no; it muſt be from a doubt of the want of one of
theſe things in him that makes the Promiſe: either
1 of <hi>Truth,</hi> or 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> of <hi>Ability</hi> to make good his word, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
of the difficulty of the thing it ſelf; or 3<hi rend="sup">d</hi> of
<hi>Sincerity</hi> to intend me really, what he ſpeaks of; or
4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>conſtant Memory</hi> to take the Opportunity of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the thing intended; or 5<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>ſtableneſs</hi> to be ſtill of
the ſame mind. Now if there be no want of any of
theſe, in him whoſe Promiſes we ſpeak of, there is
then certainly no ground of our ſtaggering, but only
from our Own unbelief.</p>
            <p>Let us now ſee whether any of theſe things, be
wanting to the Promiſes of God: and begin we with
the Firſt:</p>
            <p>1 Is there <hi>Truth</hi> in theſe Promiſes? If there be the
leaſt Occaſion in the world, to ſuſpect the Truth of
the promiſes, or the Veracity of the Promiſer, then
may our <hi>ſtaggering</hi> at them, ariſe from thence, and not
from our unbelief. On this ground it is, That all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Faith, that is bottomed meerly on the Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of man, is at beſt but a probable Opinion: for <hi>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
man is a lyar,</hi> and poſſibly may lye, in that very
thing, he is ingaged to us in. Though a Good man will
not do ſo, to ſave his life, yet it is poſſible, he may be
tempted, he may do ſo: But now the Author of the
Promiſes whereof we ſpeak, is <hi>Truth it ſelf.</hi> The God
of Truth. Who hath taken this as his ſpecial Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute,
to diſtinguiſh him, from all other. He is the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:165610:12"/>
God of Truth; and holds out this very Attribute
in a ſpecial manner, in this very thing, in making of
his Promiſe. <hi>He is faithful to forgive us our ſins,</hi> 1 Joh. 1. 9.
whence his Word is ſaid, not only to be <hi>true,</hi> but <hi>Truth,
Joh.</hi> 17. 19. Truth it ſelf: <hi>All fleſh is as graſs, but his Word
abideth for ever,</hi> Iſa 44. 1.</p>
            <p>But yet further, that it may be evident, that from
hence there can be no Occaſion of <hi>ſtaggering.</hi> This God
<hi>of Truth,</hi> whoſe <hi>Word is Truth,</hi> hath in his infinite Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
condeſcended to our weakneſs, and uſed all
poſſible means, to Cauſe us to apprehend the Truth
of his Promiſes. The Lord might have left us in the
dark, to have gathered out his Mind and Will to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
us, from obſcure Expreſſions: and knowing
of what value his Kindneſs is, it might juſtly be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
that we ſhould do ſo. Men in miſery, are glad
to lay hold of the leaſt word, that drops from him,
that can Relieve them, and to take Courage and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
upon it: As the Servants of <hi>Benhadad,</hi> watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
diligently, what would fall from the mouth of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hab,</hi>
concerning their Maſter, then in fear of death:
and when he had occaſionally called him <hi>his Brother,</hi>
they preſently laid hold of it, and cry, <hi>Thy Brother Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hadad:</hi>
1 King. 20. 35. God might have left us, and
yet have manifeſted much Free-grace, to have gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
up falling Crums, or occaſional droppings of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
and ſupply: that we ſhould have rejoyced to have
found out one word looking that way: But to ſhut up
all Objections, and to ſtop for ever the mouth of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief;
he hath not only ſpoken plainly, but hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcended
to uſe all the ways of confirming the Truth
of what he ſayes and ſpeaks, that ever were in uſe, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the ſons of men.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:165610:13"/>
There be Four wayes, whereby men ſeek to obtain
credit to what they ſpeak, as an undoubted Truth,
that there may be no Occaſion of <hi>ſtaggering.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1, <hi>By often avering and affirming of the ſame thing.</hi>
When a man ſayes the ſame thing again and again, it is
a ſign that he ſpeaks the Truth, or at leaſt that he
would be thought ſo to do. Yea, if an honeſt man,
do cleerly, fully, plainly, often ingage himſelf to us
in the ſame thing, we count it a vile jealouſie not to
believe the real Truth of his Intentions. Now the
Lord in his Promiſes often ſpeaks the ſame things, He
ſpeaks <hi>once</hi> and <hi>twice.</hi> There is not any thing, that he
hath Promiſed us, but he hath done it, again, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.
For inſtance; as if he ſhould ſay, I will be
<hi>merciful to your ſins,</hi> I pray believe me, for, <hi>I will par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
your iniquities,</hi> yea it ſhall be ſo, <hi>I will blot cut your
Tranſgreſſions as a cloud.</hi> There is not any want, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
we are liable, but thus he hath dealt concerning
it. As his Command is <hi>line upon line,</hi> ſo is his Promiſe.
And this is one way, whereby God cauſeth the Truth
of his Promiſes to appear. To take away all colour
of ſtaggering, he <hi>ſpeaks once, yea twice,</hi> if we will
hear.</p>
            <p>2, <hi>The Second way of Confirming any</hi> Truth, <hi>is by an</hi>
Oath. Though we fear the Truth of ſome men in
their Aſſertions, yet when once they come to Swear
any thing in <hi>Juſtice and Judgement,</hi> there are very few
ſo knownly profligate, and paſt all ſenſe of God, but
that their Aſſeverations do gain Credit, and paſſe for
Truth. Hence the Apoſtle tells us, <hi>Heb. 6. 16. That an
Oath for Confirmation, is to men an end of all ſtrife.</hi> Though
the Truth be before, ambiguous and doubtful, yet
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:165610:13"/>
when any interpoſes with an <hi>Oath,</hi> there is no more
Conteſt amongſt men. That nothing may be wanting
to win our Belief to the Promiſes of God, he hath ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
this Courſe alſo, he hath ſworn to their Truth,
<hi>Heb. 6 13. When God made Promiſes to</hi> Abraham, <hi>becauſe he
could ſwear by no greater, he ſware by himſelf.</hi> He confirms
his Promiſe by an Oath. <hi>O faelices nos, quorum cauſa Deus
jurat, ô infaelices, ſi nec juranti Deo credimus!</hi> When
Chriſt came, <hi>in whom all the Promiſes of God, are, Yea and
Amen,</hi> to make ſure work of the Truth of them, he
is confirmed in his Adminiſtrations, by <hi>an Oath:</hi> Heb.
7. 21. <hi>He was made a Prieſt by an Oath, by him that ſaid, The
Lord ſware, and will not repent, thou art a Prieſt for ever:</hi>
Now I pray, what is the cauſe of this great Conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcention
in the God of Heaven, to confirm that word,
which in it ſelf, is Truth, by an Oath? The Apoſtle
ſatisfies us as to the End aimed at, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 17, 18. This
was (ſaith he) the Aim of God herein, That his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
ſeeing him ingaged, by <hi>two ſuch immutable things,
as his Promiſe and his Oath,</hi> may be aſſured that there is
an utter impoſſibility, That any one word of his
ſhould come ſhort of it's Truth; or that they firmly
reſting upon it, ſhould be deceived thereby. And this
is a Second way.</p>
            <p>3, Another Courſe wherby men Confirm the Truth
of what they ſpeak, is, <hi>by entring into Covenant, to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh
what they have ſpoken.</hi> A Covenant gives ſtrength to
the Truth of any ingagement. When a man hath but
told you he will do ſuch and ſuch things for you, you
are full of doubts and fears, that he may break with
you: but when he hath indented in a Covenant, and
you can ſhew it under his Hand and Seal, you look
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:165610:14"/>
upon that, conſider that, and are very ſecure. Even
this way alſo hath the Lord taken to confirm and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſh
his Truths and Promiſes, that all doubtings
and ſtaggerings may be excluded, he hath wrapped
them all up in a Covenant, and brought himſelf into
a faederal Ingagement, that upon every Occaſion, and
at every Temptation, we may draw out his Hand and
Seal, and ſay to Satan and our own falſe hearts; ſee
here, behold God ingaged in Covenant, to make good
<hi>the word, wherein he hath cauſed me to put my Truſt:</hi> and
this is his property, That he is <hi>a God keeping Covenant:</hi>
So that having his Promiſe <hi>redoubled,</hi> and that confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by an <hi>Oath,</hi> all Sealed and made ſure by an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable
<hi>Covenant,</hi> what can we require more, to
aſſure us of the Truth of theſe things: But yet fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>4, In things of very great weight, and Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
ſuch as whereon Lives, and the Peace of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
does depend, <hi>men uſe to give Hoſtages, for the ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
each other of the Faith and Truth of all their Ingage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;</hi>
that they may be mutual Pledges of their
Truth and Fidelity. Neither hath the Lord left this
way unuſed to confirm his Promiſe. He hath given us
an Hoſtage to ſecure us of his Truth: one exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
dear to him; one alwayes in his boſome; of whoſe
Honor, he is as Careful, as of his Own. Jeſus Chriſt,
is the great Hoſtage of his Fathers Truth: the Pledge
of his Fidelity in his Promiſes. God hath ſet him forth,
and given him to us, for this end. <hi>Behold the Lord him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
ſhall give you a ſign, (a ſign</hi> that he will fulfil his
word) <hi>A virgin ſhall conceive and bare a Son, and ſhall call
his name Immanuel,</hi> Iſa, 7. 14. That you may be aſſured
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:165610:14"/>
of my Truth, <hi>the Virgins Son</hi> ſhall be a Hoſtage of it.
<hi>In him are all the Promiſes of God, Yea and Amen.</hi> Thus al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
to his Saints, he gives the further Hoſtage of his
Spirit, and the firſt fruits of Glory; that the full ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment
of all his Promiſes, may be contracted
in a little, and preſented to their view: As the <hi>Iſraelites</hi>
had the pleaſures of <hi>Canaan</hi> in the <hi>Cluſters of Grapes,</hi>
brought from thence.</p>
            <p>Now from all this it is apparent, not only that there
is Truth in all the Promiſes of God, but alſo that
Truth ſo confirmed, ſo made out, eſtabliſhed, that
not the leaſt Occaſion imaginable, is thence admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred
to <hi>ſtaggering</hi> or doubting. He that diſputes the
Promiſe, and knows not how to cloſe with them, muſt
find out another Cauſe of his ſo doing: as to the
Truth of the Promiſe, there is no doubt at all, nor
place for any.</p>
            <p>2 But Secondly, though there be <hi>Truth</hi> in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe,
yet there may want <hi>Ability</hi> in the Promiſer to
accompliſh the thing Promiſed, becauſe of it's mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold
difficulties. This may be a Second Cauſe of ſtag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gering,
if the thing it ſelf ingaged for, be not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſable,
by the Ability of the Ingager. As if a ſkil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Phyſitian, ſhould Promiſe a ſick man a Recovery
from his Diſeaſe, though he could rely upon the
Truth and Sincerity of his Friend, yet he cannot but
queſtion his <hi>Ability</hi> as to this, knowing that to cure
the leaſt Diſtemper, is not abſolutly in his power: but
when <hi>he</hi> Promiſes, who is <hi>able to performe,</hi> then all
doubting in this kind, is removed. See then whether
it be ſo, in reſpect of theſe Promiſes whereof we
ſpeak. When God comes to <hi>Abraham,</hi> to ingage him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:165610:15"/>
in that Covenant of Grace, from whence flow
all the Promiſes whereof we Treat: He laies this
down as the Bottom of all, <hi>I am</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty,
Gen.</hi> 17. 1. or, <hi>God Alſufficient,</hi> very well able to
go through with what ever I Promiſe. When Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties,
Temptations, and Troubles ariſe, remember
who it is that hath Promiſed; not only he that is true
and faithful, but he that is <hi>God Almighty,</hi> before whom
nothing can ſtand, when he will accompliſh his Word.
And that this was a bottom of great Confidence to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,</hi>
the Apoſtle tells you, <hi>Rom. 4. 21. Being fully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded
that he who had Promiſed, was able alſo to performe.</hi>
When God is ingaged by his VVord, his <hi>Ability</hi> is
eſpecially to be eyed. The Soul is apt to aſk how can
this be? it is impoſſible it ſhould be ſo to me: but, <hi>he
is able that hath Promiſed.</hi> And this, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 23. the
ſame Apoſtle holds out to us, to fix our Faith upon, in
reference to that great Promiſe of Re-calling the
Jews, and Re-implanting them into the Vine. <hi>God</hi>
(ſaith he) <hi>is able to graft them in:</hi> though now they
ſeem as <hi>dead bones,</hi> yet the Lord knows they may live,
<hi>for he is able</hi> to breath upon them, and make them <hi>ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
as an Army with Banners:</hi> Yea ſo excellent is this
Alſufficiency, this Ability of God to accompliſh his
whole VVord, that the Apoſtle cautions us, That
we do not bound it, as though it could go ſo far only,
or ſo far: Nay ſaith he, <hi>Epheſ. 3. 20. He is able to do ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
abundantly, above all that we can ask or think.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>VVhen men come to cloſe with the Promiſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
to make a life upon it, they are very ready to
queſtion and enquire, whither it be poſſible that ever
the VVord of it, ſhould be made good to them. He
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:165610:15"/>
that ſees a little Boat ſwimming at Sea, obſerves no
great difficulty in it, looks upon it without any ſolici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſs
of mind at all, beholds how it toſſes up and
down, without any fears of it's ſinking: but now,
let this man commit his own life to Sea in that Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome,
what inquiries will he make? what a ſearch
into the Veſſel? Is it poſſible (ſaith he) this little
Thing ſhould ſafe-gaurd my Life in the Ocean? It is
ſo with us, in our view of the Promiſes: whilſt we
conſider them at large, as they lye in the Word, alaſs!
they are all true, <hi>all Yea and Amen,</hi> ſhall be all accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed:
but when we go to venture our Souls upon
a Promiſe, in an Ocean of Wrath and Temptations,
then every blaſt we think will over-turn it: it will
not bear us above all theſe Waves; Is it poſſible we
ſhould ſwim ſafely upon the Plank of a Pinnace in the
middeſt of the Ocean?</p>
            <p>Now here we are apt to deceive our ſelves, and
miſtake the whole thing in Queſtion, Which is the
Bottom of many corrupted Reaſonings and perplex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Thoughts. We enquire whether it can be ſo to
us, as the Word holds out; when the Truth is, The
Queſtion is not about the Nature of the Thing; but
about the Power of God. Place the Doubt aright,
and it is this, Is God <hi>able</hi> to accompliſh what he hath
ſpoken? Can he heal my Back-ſlidings? Can he par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
my Sins? Can he ſave my Soul? Now that there
may be no Occaſion, nor Colour of Staggering upon
this Point, you ſee God reveals himſelf as an <hi>Alſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
God:</hi> as one that is able to go through with all
his Engagements. If you will <hi>ſtagger,</hi> you may ſo do;
this is certain, you have no Cauſe to do ſo from hence;
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:165610:16"/>
there is not any Promiſe that ever God entred into,
but he is able to perform it.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Object."/> But you will ſay, Though God be thus <hi>able,</hi> thus
<hi>Alſufficient,</hi> yet may there not be Defects in the <hi>Means</hi>
whereby he worketh? As a man may have a ſtrong
Arm able to ſtrike his Enemies to the ground, but yet
if he ſtrike with a Feather, or a Straw, it will not be
done; not for want of ſtrength in his Arm, but of fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and ſutableneſs in the Inſtrument, whereby he
acteth. But,</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Anſw."/> 1, God uſing Inſtruments, they do not Act accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to their own Vertue, but according to the Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of Vertue by him to them Communicated. Look
to what End ſoever God is pleaſed to uſe any Means,
his chuſing of them, fills them with Efficacy to that
purpoſe. Let the Way and <hi>Means</hi> of Accompliſhing
what thou expecteſt by the Promiſe, be in themſelves
never ſo weak, yet know, that from God's chuſing of
them, to that End, they ſhall be filled with Vertue
and Efficacy to the Accompliſhment of it.</p>
            <p>2, It is expreſly affirmed of the great <hi>Medium's</hi> of

is the Word of God: and of this alſo it is affirmed
that it is <hi>able.</hi> It hath an Alſufficiency in it's kind. <hi>Paul</hi>
tells the Elders of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> That the <hi>Word of Grace is
able to build them up, and to give them an Inheritance among
them that are Sanctified,</hi> Act. 20. 32.</p>
            <p>3 There is the great <hi>Means of Operation,</hi> and that is
the Spirit of Grace: He works the Mercy of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
upon the Soul: He alſo is <hi>able,</hi> exceeding power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
to effect the End appointed. It hath no bounds,
nor meaſure of Operation, but only it's own <hi>Will:</hi>
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 11.</p>
            <p>Hence then it is apparent in the Second Place, That
there is no Occaſion for Doubting; yea, that all ſtag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gering
is excluded, from the Conſideration of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
of the Promiſer, and the means whereby he
worketh: If thou continueſt to ſtagger, thou muſt
get a better Plea then this, <hi>it cannot be,</hi> it is impoſſible:
I tell thee nay, but God is <hi>able</hi> to accompliſh the
whole Word of his Promiſe. But,</p>
            <p>3, There may be want of <hi>Sincerity</hi> in Promiſes and
Engagements, which whileſt we do but ſuſpect, we
cannot chuſe but <hi>ſtagger at them.</hi> If a man make a
Promiſe to me, and I can ſuppoſe that he intends not
as he ſayes, but hath Reſerves to himſelf of another
purpoſe, I muſt needs doubt, as to the Accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of what he hath ſpoken. If the Soul may ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe,
that the Lord intends not him <hi>ſincerely</hi> in his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes,
but Reſerves ſome other Thing in his Mind, or
that it ſhall be ſo to others and not to him, he muſt
needs diſpute in himſelf, ſtagger, and keep off from
Believing. This, then muſt be Demonſtrated in the
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:165610:17"/>
               <hi>Third Place,</hi> That the Promiſes of God; and God in
all his Promiſes, are full <hi>of ſincerity,</hi> ſo that none need
fear to caſt himſelf on them, they ſhall be real unto
him. Now concerning this, Obſerve,</p>
            <p>1 That <hi>God's Promiſes are not Declarative of his ſecret
Purpoſes and Intentions.</hi> When God holds out to any
a Promiſe of the pardon of Sin, this doth not ſignifie
to any ſingular man, That it is the <hi>Purpoſe</hi> of God, that
his Sin ſhall be pardoned. For if ſo, Then either all
men muſt be pardoned to whom the Word of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
comes, which is not: or elſe God fails of his Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes,
and comes ſhort of his Intendments; which
would render him, either Impotent, that he could not;
or Mutable, that he would not eſtabliſh them: but,
<hi>who hath reſiſted his Will?</hi> Rom. 9. <hi>He is the Lord, and he
changeth not:</hi> Mal. 1. So that though every one, to
whom the Promiſe is held out, hath not the fruit of
the Promiſe; yet this derogates not at all, from the
ſincerity of God in his Promiſes; for, he doth not
hold them forth to any ſuch End and Purpoſe, as to
declare his Intentions, concerning particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</p>
            <p>2 <hi>There are ſome abſolute Promiſes, comprehenſive of the
Covenant of Grace,</hi> which as to all thoſe that belong to
that Covenant, do hold out thus much of the Mind
of God, That they ſhall certainly be Accompliſhed,
in, and towards them all. The Soul may freely be
invited to venture on theſe Promiſes, with Aſſurance
of their Efficacy towards him.</p>
            <p>3 This God principally declares in all his Promiſes,
of his Mind and Purpoſe, That every Soul, to whom
they ſhall come, may freely reſt on; to wit, <hi>That Faith
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:165610:17"/>
in the Promiſes, and the Accompliſhment of the Promiſes, are
inſeparable.</hi> He that believeth, ſhall enjoy; This is
moſt certain, this God declares of his Mind, his heart
towards us, That as for all the good Things, he hath
ſpoken of to us, it ſhall be to us, <hi>according to our Faith.</hi>
This I ſay the Promiſes of God do ſignifie of his Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
That <hi>the Believer of them, ſhall be the Enjoyer of them:</hi>
In them, <hi>the Righteouſneſs of God is revealed from Faith to
Faith,</hi> Rom. 1. 17. From the Faith of God Revealing,
to the Faith of Man Receiving: So that upon the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
out of any Promiſe, you may ſafely Conclude,
That upon Believing, the Mercy, the Chriſt, the Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance
of this Promiſe, is mine. It is true, if a man
ſtand diſputing and ſtaggering, whether he have any
ſhare in a Promiſe, and cloſe not with it by Faith, he
may come ſhort of it; and yet without the leaſt Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachment
of the Truth of the Promiſe, or ſincerity
of the Promiſer: for God hath not ſignified by them,
That men ſhall enjoy the good Things of them, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they believe, or not. Thus far the Promiſes of
Grace are General, and carry a Truth to all, that there
is an inviolable Connexion between Believing, and
the Enjoyment of the Things in them contained. And
in this Truth, is the Sincerity of the Promiſer, which
can never be queſtioned, without Sin and Folly. And
this wholly ſhuts up the Spirit from any occaſion of
ſtaggering. <hi>O ye of little Faith! wherefore do ye doubt?</hi> Ah!
leſt our ſhare be not in this Promiſe; leſt we are not
intended in it: Poor Creatures! there is but this one
way of keeping you off from it, that is, Diſputing it
in your ſelves by Unbelief. Here lyes the <hi>Sincerity</hi> of
God towards thee, That <hi>Believing,</hi> thou ſhalt not come
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:165610:18"/>
ſhort of what thou aimeſt at. Here then is no Room
for ſtaggering. If Proclamation be made, granting
Pardon to all ſuch Rebels, as ſhall come in by ſuch a
ſeaſon, do men uſe to ſtand queſtioning whether
the STATE bear them any good will, or no? No, ſaith
the poor Creature, I will caſt my ſelf upon Their
Faith &amp; Truth engaged in Their Proclamation what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
I have deſerved in particular, I know They will
be Faithful in Their Promiſes. The Goſpel-Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
is of Pardon to all Comers in, to all Believers:
it is not for thee, poor ſtaggerer, to queſtion, what is
the Intendment towards thee in particular, but roll
thy ſelf on this, There is an abſolute Sincerity in
the ENGAGEMENT, which thou mayeſt freely reſt
upon. But,</p>
            <p>4, Though all be preſent, <hi>Truth, Power, Sincerity;</hi>
yet if he that makes the Promiſe ſhould <hi>Forget,</hi> this
were a ground of ſtaggering. <hi>Pharaoh's</hi> Butler, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
doubt, made large Promiſes to <hi>Joſeph,</hi> and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably
ſpake the Truth according to his preſent In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention:
afterwards ſtanding in the preſence of <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh,</hi>
reſtored to Favour, he had doubtleſs Power e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to have procured the liberty of a poor Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
Priſoner: but yet this would not do, it did not
profit <hi>Joſeph;</hi> becauſe, as the Text ſayes, <hi>he did not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member</hi>
Joſeph, <hi>but forgat him:</hi> Gen. 39. 23. This for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting
made all other things uſeleſs. But neither hath
<hi>this,</hi> the leaſt Colour in Divine Promiſes. It was <hi>Syons</hi>
infirmity to ſay, <hi>The Lord hath forſaken me, and my God
hath forgotten me:</hi> Iſa. 49. 14. For, ſaith the Lord, <hi>Can
a woman forget her ſucking Child, that ſhe ſhould not have
compaſſion on the Son of her womb? yea, they may forget,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:165610:18"/>
but I will not forget thee: behold, I have graven thee upon the
palmes of my hands, and thy walls are continually before me:
verſ.</hi> 15, 16.</p>
            <p>The Cauſes of forgetfulnes are, 1 <hi>Want of Love.</hi> The
things that men Love not, they care not for: the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of their Love are continually in their thoughts.
Now ſays God to <hi>Syon,</hi> Why ſayeſt thou, <hi>I have forgotten
thee?</hi> Is it for want of Love? Alaſs! the Love of a
moſt tender Mother to her ſucking Child, comes infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitly
ſhort of my Love to thee: My Love to thee, is
more fixed than ſo, and how ſhouldeſt thou be out of
my mind? How ſhouldeſt thou be forgotten? <hi>Infinite
Love will have infinite Thoughtfulneſs and Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2 <hi>Multiplicity of buſineſs:</hi> This with men is a Cauſe
of forgetting. I had done ſayes one, as I Promiſed,
but multiplicity of Occaſions thruſt it out of my
mind, I pray excuſe me: Alaſs! though I Rule all
the World, yet, <hi>thou art graven upon the palms of my
hands, and therefore thy walls are continually before me.</hi> See
alſo <hi>Pſal.</hi> 77. 9. Neither then is there as to this, the
leaſt colour given us, to <hi>ſtagger</hi> at the Promiſe of
God.</p>
            <p>5, But laſtly, Where all other things concur, yet if
the perſon Promiſing be <hi>changable,</hi> if he may alter his
Reſolution, a man may juſtly doubt and debate in
himſelf, the Accompliſhment of any Promiſe made to
him: It is true, may he ſay, He now ſpeaks his heart
and mind, but who can ſay he will be of this mind to
morrow? May he not be turned, and then what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
of the Golden Mountains, that I Promiſed my
ſelf upon his Engagement? Wherefore in the laſt
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:165610:19"/>
place, the Lord carefully rejects all ſinful ſurmiſes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the leaſt change or alteration in him or any of
his Engagements. <hi>He is the Father of Lights, with whom
is no variableneſs, nor ſhadow of turning; Jam.</hi> 1. 18. no ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow,
no appearance of any ſuch thing. <hi>I am the Lord</hi>
(ſaith he) <hi>I change not; therefore ye Sons of</hi> Jacob <hi>are not
conſumed. Mal</hi> 3. 6. The Lord knows, that if any thing
in us, might prevail with him to alter the Word that
is gone out of his mouth, we ſhould ſurely periſh. We
are poor provoking Creatures, therefore he laies our,
<hi>not being conſumed,</hi> only on this, even his <hi>Own unchanga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs:</hi>
This we may reſt upon, <hi>he is of one mind, and
who can turn him?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And in theſe Obſervations, have I given you the
firſt Demonſtration of the Point: <hi>All ſtaggering is from
our own unbelief.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2 Dem."/> The <hi>Experience</hi> which we have of the mighty Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings
of God, for the Accompliſhment of all his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes,
gives light unto this thing. We have found it
true, That where he is once engaged, he will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
go through unto the appointed Iſſue, though
it ſtand him in the laying out of his Power and Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
to the uttermoſt. <hi>Hab. 3. 9. Thy Bow was made quite
naked according to the Oath's of the Tribes, thy Word.</hi> If
Gods Oath be paſſed, and his Word engaged; he will
ſurely accompliſh it, though it coſt him the <hi>making of
his bow quite naked,</hi> the manifeſtation of his power to
the utmoſt.</p>
            <p>It is true: Never did any wait upon God for the
Accompliſhment and fulfilling of a Promiſe, but he
found many difficulties fall out between the Word
and the Thing. So was it with <hi>Abraham</hi> in the buſineſs
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:165610:19"/>
of a Son: and ſo with <hi>David</hi> in the matter of a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.
God will have his Promiſed Mercies to fall, as
the Dews upon the parched gaſping Earth; or <hi>as the
ſhadow of a great Rock in a weary Land,</hi> Iſa. 32. 2. very wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>com
unto the Traveller, who hath had the Sun beat
upon his head in his travel all the day. <hi>Zion is a Crown
of Glory in the hand of the Lord, as a royal Diadem in the hand
of her God:</hi> Iſa. 62. 3. The precious Stones of a <hi>Diadem,</hi>
muſt be cut and polliſhed, before they be ſet in Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and Glory. God will have oftimes the <hi>precious li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
ſtones of Zion,</hi> to have many a ſharp <hi>cutting,</hi> before
they come to be fully fixed in his Diadem: but yet
in the cloſe, whatever Obſtacles ſtand in the way, the
Promiſe hath ſtill wrought out it's paſſage: As a Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
all the while it is ſtopped with a Damme, is ſtill
working higher and higher, ſtill getting more and
more ſtrength, until it bear down all before it, and
obtain a free courſe to it's appointed place: Every
time Oppoſition lyes againſt the fulfilling of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise,
and ſo ſeems to impede it for a ſeaſon, it gets
more and more Power, until the appointed hour be
come, and then it bears down all before it.</p>
            <p>Were there any thing imaginable, whereof we had
not Experience, that it hath been conquered to open
a door for the fulfilling of every Word of God, we
might poſſibly, as to the Apprehenſion of that thing,
<hi>ſtagger</hi> from ſome other Principle, then that of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What is there in Heaven or Earth, but God and his
miniſtring Spirits, that hath not at one time or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
ſtood up to it's utmoſt Oppoſition, for the fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrating
of the Word, wherein ſome or other of the
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:165610:20"/>
Saints of God have put their truſt? <hi>Divels</hi> in their
Temptations, Baits, Subtilties, Accuſations, and Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions:
<hi>Men</hi> in their Counſels, Reaſonings, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivances,
Intereſts, Dominions, Combinations, Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
Multitudes, and the utmoſt of their Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours:

Courſe, <hi>Fire, Water, Day, Night, Age, Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
Death;</hi> all in their Courſes have fought againſt
the Accompliſhment of the Promiſes: And what have
they obtained by all their Contendings? All diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed,
fruſtrated, turned back, changed, and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
only to make the Mercy of the Promiſe, more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miable
and glorious.</p>
            <p>I would willingly Illuſtrate this <hi>Demonſtration</hi> with
an Inſtance, that the Almighty, al conquering Power
that is in the Promiſe, ſettling all <hi>ſtaggering</hi> upon it's

            <p>I might here mention <hi>Abraham,</hi> with all the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties

Heb.</hi> 11. 19. Or I might ſpeak of <hi>Joſeph, Moſes,</hi> or <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid:</hi>
but I ſhall rather chuſe a Preſident from among

and that in a buſineſs, concerning which, we may ſet

            </p>
            <p>Look upon the Affaire of <hi>Ireland.</hi> The Engagement

againſt the <hi>man of Sin,</hi> furniſhed the undertakers with

of Oppoſition,</hi> that lay in the way againſt any Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs
in that Place; and hear the Lord ſaying to every
one of them, <hi>Who art thou, O great Mountain? before my
People thou ſhalt be made a Plain:</hi> Zech. 4. 7.</p>
            <p>Not to mention the ſtrivings and ſtruglings of <hi>two
manner of People,</hi> in the womb of this Nation, totally
obſtructing for a long time the bringing forth of any
Deliverance for <hi>Ireland:</hi> nor yet, That mighty
Mountain, (which ſome miſ-named <hi>a Level)</hi> that
thought at once to have locked an everlaſting Door
upon that Expedition: I ſhall Propoſe ſome few (of
many) that have attended it.</p>
            <p>1 The <hi>ſilence that hath been in Heaven for half an hour as
to this Buſineſs:</hi> The great Ceſſation of Prayers in
the Heavens, of many Churches, hath been no ſmall
Mountain in the way of the Promiſe. When God
will do good for <hi>Zion,</hi> he requires that his <hi>Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brancers
give him no reſt, until he do it.</hi> Iſa. 62. 7. and yet
ſometimes in the cloſe of their Supplications, gives

<hi>Silent to the Prayers of his People,</hi> Pſal. 28. 1. Is not

Prayers? Of how many Congregations in this Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
may the Prayers, Tears, and Supplications for
the carrying on of the Work of God in <hi>IRELAND,</hi>
be written with the <hi>lines of emptineſs?</hi> What a <hi>Silence
hath been in the Heaven</hi> of many Churches, <hi>for this laſt half

Work, did never Sacrifice at the Altar of <hi>Jehova niſſi:</hi>
               <pb n="36" facs="tcp:165610:21"/>
nor conſidered that the Lord hath <hi>ſworn to have War
with ſuch Amalekites</hi> as are there, <hi>from Generation to Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration?</hi>
Exod. 17. 15, 16. They have forgotten, That
<hi>Ireland</hi> was <hi>the firſt of the Nations</hi> that laid waite for the
bloud of Gods People deſiring to enter into his reſt;
and therefore <hi>their latter end ſhall be, to periſh for ever:
Numb.</hi> 24. 20. Many are as angry as <hi>Jonah,</hi> not that <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon</hi>
is ſpared, but that it is not ſpared. Hath not
this been held out as a Mountain? what will you now
do, when ſuch or ſuch, theſe and thoſe men, of this
or that Party, look upon you <hi>as the graſs upon the houſe
tops, which withereth afore it groweth up: wherewith the
Mower filleth not his hand, nor he that bindeth ſheaves his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome,</hi>
That will not ſo much as ſay, <hi>The bleſſing of the
Lord be upon you, we bleſs you in the name of the Lord?</hi> But
now! ſhall the faithleſneſs of men, make the <hi>Faith of
God of none effect?</hi> Shall the kingdom of Chriſt ſuffer
becauſe ſome of thoſe that are his, what through
Carnal Wiſdom, what through Spiritual Folly, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe
to come forth <hi>to his help, againſt the mighty?</hi> no

that there is no man, and wonders that there is no Interceſſour:
(even marvels that there are no more Supplications on this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half)
therefore his own Arm brought Salvation to him, and
his own Righteouſneſs it ſuſtained him: He put on Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
as a breſtplate, and an helmet of Salvation upon his head:
and he put on the garments of Vengeance for cloathing, and was
clad with Zeal as a Cloak: according to their deeds, according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
he will repay, fury to his adverſaries, recompence to his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
to the Iſland he will repay recompence:</hi> Iſa. 59. 15, 16,
17, 18. Some men's not Praying, ſhall not hinder
the Promiſes accompliſhing. They may ſooner diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover

            </p>
            <p>2 Our own Adviſes and Counſels have often ſtood
in the way of the Promiſes <hi>bringing forth:</hi> This is not
a Time nor Place for Narrations: ſo I ſhall only ſay
to this in general; That if the choyceſt and moſt ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
Adviſes of the Army, had not been overſwayed
by the Providence of God, in all probabilities, your
Affairs had been more then ten degrees backward, to
the Condition wherein they are.</p>
            <p>3 The <hi>viſible Oppoſition of the combined Enemy</hi> in that
Nation, ſeemed as to our ſtrength, unconquerable.
The wiſeman tells us, <hi>That a Threefold Cord is not eaſily
broken: Ireland</hi> had a <hi>Fivefold Cord</hi> to make ſtrong bands
for <hi>Zion,</hi> twiſted together: Never (I think) did ſuch
different Intereſts <hi>bear with one another,</hi> for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſing
of one common End.</p>
            <p>He that met the <hi>Lyon,</hi> the <hi>Fox,</hi> and the <hi>Aſſe</hi> traveling

theſe ill-matched Aſſociates did bend their Courſe!
neither did his marvelling ceaſe, when he heard they
were going a Pilgrimage, in a buſineſs of Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>He that ſhould meet <hi>Proteſtants, Covenanted Proteſtants,</hi>
that had ſworn in the Preſence of the great God, to
extirpate <hi>Popery and Prelacy,</hi> as the <hi>Scots in <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lſter;</hi>
Others, that counted themſelves under no leſs ſacred
bond, for the maintainance of <hi>Prelats, Service-Book,</hi>
and the like; as the whole Party of <hi>Ormonds</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herents:
joyned with a mighty number, that had for
Eight yeers together, ſealed their Vows to the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh
Religion, with our bloud and their own; adding
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:165610:22"/>
to them thoſe that were <hi>profound to revolt</hi> up and down,
as ſuted their own Intereſt, as ſome in <hi>Munſter;</hi> All
cloſing with that Party, which themſelves had la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured

embruing their hands in each others blood, to march
all one way together, cannot but marvel, <hi>quo unà iter
facerent,</hi> whither they ſhould journey ſo friendly to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether:
Neither ſurely, would his Admiration be
leſſened, when he ſhould hear, That the firſt thing
they intended and agreed upon, was, To cover the
innocent Bloud of 41; contrary to that Promiſe:
<hi>Behold the Lord commeth out of his place, to puniſh the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants
of the earth, for their iniquity: the earth alſo ſhall
diſcloſe her Bloud, and ſhall no more cover her ſlain:</hi> Iſa. 26.

            <p>Now how can the Promiſe ſtand in the way of this

Why Firſt, ſaith the Lord, <hi>Though hand joyn in hand,
the wicked ſhall not be unpuniſhed: Prov.</hi> 11. 21. Their
Covering ſhall be too ſhort, and narrow, to hide the
blood which God will have diſcloſed.</p>

               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:165610:22"/>
who agree in nothing elſe in the World; yet they ſhall
be <hi>broken in pieces; though they Aſſociate themſelves, they
ſhall be broken in pieces:</hi> If <hi>Rezin,</hi> and the Son of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maliah,
Syria</hi> and <hi>Ephraim, old</hi> Adverſaries, combine
together for a <hi>new</hi> Enmity againſt <hi>Judah;</hi> If <hi>Covenant</hi>
and <hi>Prelacy, Popery</hi> and <hi>Treachery, Bloud</hi> and (as to that)
<hi>Innocency,</hi> joyn hand in hand, to ſtand in the way of
the Promiſe; yet I will not in this joyn with them ſayes
the Lord Though they were preſerved all diſtinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in their ſeveral Intereſts for ſeven yeers, in their
mutual conflicts, That they might be ſcourges to one
another; yet if they cloſe, to keep off the Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of God in the Word of his Promiſe, not much
more then the 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> part of one yeer, ſhall conſume
ſome of them to nothing, and fill the Reſidue with
indignation and anguiſh.</p>
            <p>By what Means God hath mightily and effectually
wrought, by mixing Folly with their Counſels, put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
Fear, Terror, and Amazedneſs upon all their Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakings,
to carry on his own Purpoſe, I could
eaſily give conſiderable Inſtances. That which hath
been ſpoken in General, may ſuffice to bottome us on
<hi>this,</hi> That whileſt we are in the way of God, all <hi>ſtag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gering</hi>
at the Iſſue, is from <hi>unbelief;</hi> for he can, he will
do more ſuch things as theſe.</p>

Learn hence then <hi>to live more by Faith</hi> in all your
Actings: <hi>Believe,</hi> and <hi>you ſhall be eſtabliſhed:</hi> I have in
the <hi>dayes of my Pilgrimage</hi> ſeen <hi>this evil under the Sun:</hi>
Many Profeſſors of the Goſpel, called out to Publick
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:165610:23"/>
Actings, have made it their great Deſign to manage
all their Affairs with Wiſdom and Policy, like the
<hi>men of the reſidue of the Nations.</hi> Living by Faith, upon
the Promiſes, hath appeared to them, as too low a
thing, for the Condition and Employment wherein
they now are: Now they muſt Plot, and Contrive,
and Deſign, lay down Principles of Carnal Fleſhly
Wiſdome, to be purſued to the uttermoſt: And
what I pray hath been the Iſſue of ſuch Underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings?</p>
            <p>1 Firſt, The Power of Religion hath totally been
devoured, by that lean, hungry, never to be ſatisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Beaſt of Carnal Policy: No ſigns left that it was
ever in their boſoms. Conformity unto Chriſt in
Goſpel Graces, is looked on as a mean Contemptible
Thing: Some of them have faln to down-right A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thieſme,
moſt of them to wretched Formality in the
Things of God. And then,</p>
            <p>2 Secondly, Their Plots and Undertakings, have
generally proved Tympanous and Birthleſs: Vexati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and Diſappointment hath been the Protion of the
Reſidue of their dayes. The ceaſing to lean upon the
Lord, and ſtriving to be Wiſe in our Actings, like
the men of the World, hath made more <hi>Rehoboams,</hi>
than any one Thing in this Generation.</p>
            <p>What now lyes at the Bottom of all this? <hi>meerly
ſtaggering at the Promiſe, through <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelief.</hi> What build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
is that like to be, which hath a <hi>ſtaggering</hi> Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?
When God Anſwers not <hi>Saul,</hi> he goes to the
Devil. When the Promiſe will not ſupport us, we
go to Carnal Policy: neither can it otherwiſe be. En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagedmen,
finding one way to diſappoint them, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:165610:23"/>
betake themſelves to another. If men begin
once to <hi>Stagger</hi> at the Promiſe, and to conclude in
their fears, That it will not receive accompliſhment,
That the <hi>Fountain</hi> will be dry, they cannot but think
it high time, to <hi>digge Ciſterns</hi> for themſelves. When
<hi>David</hi> ſayes, <hi>He ſhall one day periſh by the hand of</hi> Saul,
(whatever God had ſaid to the contrary) His next ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe
is, Let <hi>me go to the Philiſtins:</hi> and what ſucces he had
in that Undertaking, you know. <hi>Political diverſions,
from pure dependance on the Promiſe, do alwayes draw after
them, a long time of entanglements.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Give me leave to give a VVord of Caution, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
One or Two Things, which men <hi>ſtag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gering</hi>
at the Promiſes through Unbelief, do
uſually in their Carnal VViſdome run into,
for the Compaſſing of the Thing aimed at,
That they may not be found in your Honor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Aſſembly.</p>
            <p>1 <hi>Take heed of a various management of Religion, of the
Things of God, to the advantage of the preſent Poſture and
Condition of your Affairs.</hi> The Things of Chriſt ſhould
be as <hi>Joſeph's Sheaf,</hi> to which all others ſhould <hi>bow.</hi>
VVhen they are made to cringe, and bend, and put
on a flattering countenance, to allure any ſort of men
into their Intereſt, they are no more the Things of
Chriſt. I would it had not been too evident former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
That men entangled in their Affairs, enjoying Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
have with all induſtry and diligence, purſued
ſuch and ſuch an appearance of Religion; not that
themſelves were ſo paſſionately affected with it, but
meerly for the ſatisfaction of ſome in that, whoſe
Aſſiſtance and Complyance they needed for other
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:165610:24"/>
things. Oh let not the Things of God, be immixed
any more with Carnal Reaſonings. His Truths are all
eternal and unchangeable. Give them at once the
Soveraignty of your Souls, and have not the leaſt
thought of making them bend, to ſerve your own
Ends, though good and Righteous. Think not
to get the Promiſe like <hi>Jacob,</hi> by repreſenting your
ſelves in the Things of God, for other then you
are.</p>
            <p>2 <hi>Hide no Truth of God, as to that way of manifeſtation
which to you is committed, for fear it ſhould prove prejudicial
to your Affairs.</hi> That Influence and Signature of your
Power, which is due to any Truth of God, let it not
be with-held by Carnal Reaſonings. I might further
draw out theſe, and ſuch like things as theſe; the
warning is, To live upon the Faith of that Promiſe,
which ſhall ſurely be eſtabliſhed, without turning
aſide to needleſs crooked paths of your own.</p>
            <p>
               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>2</label> 2 Secondly, Be faithful in doing all the work of
God whereunto you are engaged, as he is faithful in
<hi>working all your works</hi> whereunto he is engaged. Your
work whereunto (whileſt you are in his wayes) God
is engaged, is your ſafety and protection. Gods work
whereunto you are engaged is the Propagating of
the Kingdom of Chriſt, and the ſetting up of the
<hi>Standard of the Goſpel.</hi> So far as you find God going on
with your work, go you on with his. How is it that
Jeſus Chriſt, is in <hi>Ireland</hi> only as a <hi>Lyon ſtayning all his
garments with the bloud of his Enemies?</hi> and none to hold
him out as a <hi>Lamb ſprinkled with his own bloud</hi> to his
friends? Is it the Soveraignty and Intereſt of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
that is alone to be there tranſacted? For my part,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:165610:24"/>
I ſee no further into the MYSTERY of theſe
things, but that I could heartily rejoyce, That Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
blood being expiated, the <hi>Iriſh</hi> might enjoy <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land
ſo long as the Moon endureth,</hi> ſo that Jeſus Chriſt
might poſſeſſe the <hi>Iriſh.</hi> But God having ſuffered
thoſe ſworn Vaſſals of the <hi>man of Sin,</hi> to break out in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
ſuch wayes of Villany, as render them obnoxious
unto Vengeance, upon ſuch rules of Government a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
men, as he hath appointed: Is there there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
nothing to be done, but to give a <hi>Cup of Blood</hi> into
their hands? Doubtleſs the way whereby God will
bring the <hi>followers after the Beaſt</hi> to Condign Deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
for all their Enmity to the Lord Jeſus, will be,
By ſuffering them to run into ſuch practiſes againſt
men, as ſhall righteouſly expoſe them to vengeance,
according to acknowledged Principles among the
Sons of Men. But is this all? Hath he no further
Aime? Is not all this to make way for the Lord Jeſus
to take Poſſeſſion of his long ſince Promiſed Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance?
And ſhall we ſtop at the firſt Part? Is this
to deal fairly with the Lord Jeſus? Call him out to
the Battel, and then keep away his Crown? God
hath been faithful in doing great things for you, be
faithful in this one, Do your utmoſt for the Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Goſpel in <hi>Ireland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Give me leave to adde a few Motives to this
Duty.</p>
            <p>1 <hi>They want it:</hi> No want like theirs who want the
Goſpel. I would there were for the preſent, one
Goſpel Preacher, for every Walled Town in the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:165610:25"/>
Poſſeſſion in <hi>IRELAND.</hi> The Land mourneth,
and <hi>the People periſh for want of knowledge: Many run to and
fro,</hi> but it is upon other deſigns; <hi>knowledge is not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2 They are ſenſible of their <hi>Wants,</hi> and cry out for
<hi>Supply.</hi> The Tears and Cryes of the Inhabitants of
<hi>Dublin,</hi> after the Manifeſtations of Chriſt, are ever
in my view. If they were in the dark, <hi>and lived to
have it ſo,</hi> it might ſomething cloſe a door upon the
bowels of our Compaſſion: but they cry out of their
darkneſs, and are ready to follow every one whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
to have a Candle. If their being Goſpelleſs,
move not our hearts, it is hoped, Their importunate
Cryes will diſquiet our Reſt: and wreſt help, as a
Beggar doth an Alms.</p>
            <p>3 <hi>Seducers</hi> and <hi>Blaſphemers</hi> will not be wanting to
<hi>ſow their Tares,</hi> which thoſe Fallowed Fields will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
if there be none to caſt in the Seed of the
Word. Some are come over thither already without
Call, without Employments, to no other end, but
only to vaunt themſelves to be God; as they have
done in the open ſtreets, with deteſtable Pride, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thieſme
and Folly: So that as <hi>IRELAND</hi> was here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore
termed by ſome in Civil things, <hi>A Frippery of
Bankrupts,</hi> for the great number of Perſons of bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
Eſtates that went thither: So doubtleſs in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
it will prove <hi>A Frippery of Monſtrous, Enormous
Contradictious Opinions,</hi> if the Work of Preaching the
Word of Truth, and ſoberneſs, be not carried on.
And if this be the Iſſue of your preſent Undertakings,
Will it be acceptable, think you, to the LORD
JESUS, That you have uſed his POWER
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:165610:25"/>
and MIGHT, to make way for ſuch THINGS,
as his Soul abhors?</p>
            <p>1 Will it be for his Honour, That the People
whom he hath ſought to himſelf with ſo <hi>high a hand,</hi>
ſhould at the very entrance of his taking Poſſeſſion,
be leavened with thoſe high and heavenly Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
which have an open, and experimented ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency
to Earthly, Fleſhly, Dunghill Practiſes?
Or,</p>
            <p>2 Will it be for the Credit and Honour of your
Profeſſion of the GOSPEL, That ſuch a <hi>breach
ſhould be under your hand?</hi> That it ſhould be (as it were)
<hi>by your means?</hi> Will it not be a <hi>Sword, and an Arrow,
and a Maul</hi> in the hands of your Obſervers? Who
can bear the juſt Scandal that would accrew? Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal
to the Magiſtrates, Scandal to the Miniſters of
this Generation, in neglecting ſuch an Opportunity
of advancing the GOSPEL; ſleeping all the day,
whileſt others <hi>ſow Tares.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3 Where will be the hoped, the expected Conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
of this great Affaire, when the Teſtimony and
Pledge of the peculiar Preſence of CHRIST
amongſt us, upon ſuch an ISSUE, ſhall be wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>What then ſhall we do? This Thing is often ſpoken of,
ſeldom driven to any cloſe!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1 Pray; Pray the Lord of the Harveſt, That
he would ſend out, That he <hi>would thruſt forth Labourers
into his Harveſt.</hi> The Labourers are ready to ſay,
<hi>There is a Lyon in the way:</hi> Difficulties to be Conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:165610:26"/>
withal: And to ſome men it is hard ſeeing a <hi>Call
of GOD,</hi> through Difficulties: When if it would but
cloath it ſelf with a few Carnal Advantages, how ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent
is it to them? They can ſee it through a little
Cranny. Be earneſt then with the Maſter of theſe
<hi>Labourers,</hi> in whoſe hand is <hi>their life and breath, and all
their wayes;</hi> That he would powerfully <hi>Conſtrain</hi> them,
to be willing to enter into the Fields, that are <hi>White for
the Harveſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2 Make ſuch Proviſion, That thoſe who will go,
may be fenced from outward Straights and Fears, ſo
far as the uncertainty of humane Affairs in General,
and the preſent tumultuating perturbations will ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit.
And let not I beſeech you, this be the buſineſs
of an unpurſued Order. But,</p>
            <p>3 Let ſome be appointed (Generals dye and
ſink by themſelves) to Conſider this thing, and to
hear what ſober PROPOSALS may be made by
any, whoſe Hearts God ſhall ſtir up to ſo good a
Work.</p>
            <p>This I ſay is a Work wherein God expecteth Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs
from you: Stagger not at his Promiſes, nor
your own Duty. However by all means poſſible, in
this Buſineſs, I have ſtrived to deliver my own Soul.</p>
            <p>Once more, to this of Faith, let me ſtir you up to
another Work of Love: and that in the behalf of
many poor periſhing Creatures, that want all Things
needful for the ſuſtentation of Life. Poor Parentleſs
Children, that lye Begging, Starving, Rotting in the
Streets, and find no Relief: Yea, Perſons of Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
that have loſt their deareſt Relations in your Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
ſeeking for Bread, and finding none. Oh that
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:165610:26"/>
ſome thoughts of this alſo, might be ſeriouſly Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted

Lives upon the right ſhoulder.</hi> In our <hi>STAGGERINGS,</hi>
our Doubtings, our Diſputes, we are apt to aſſign
this and that Reaſon of them; when the ſole Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
indeed is our Unbelief. Were it not for ſuch a
Cauſe, or ſuch a Cauſe, I could Believe; that is,
Were there no need of Faith. That is Faith muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
the <hi>Mountains</hi> that lye in the way, and then all
will be plain. It is not the greatneſs of Sin, nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance
in Sin, nor backſliding into Sin, that is the
true Cauſe of thy Staggering, whatever thou pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeſt:
The removal of all theſe is from that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe,
whoſe Stability and Certainty, I before laid
forth: but ſolely from thy Unbelief, That <hi>root of bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſs
which ſprings up and troubles thee.</hi> It is not the
diſtance of the Earth from the Sun, nor the Sun's
withdrawing it ſelf, that makes a dark and gloomy
day, but the Interpoſition of Clouds and vaparous Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halations.
Neither is thy Soul beyond the reach of
the Promiſe; nor doth God with-draw himſelf, but
the vapours of thy Carnal Unbelieving Heart, do
Cloud thee. It is ſaid of one place, <hi>Chriſt could do no
great Work there:</hi> Why ſo? For want of Power in him?
not at all: but meerly for want of Faith in them; it
was <hi>becauſe of their <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelief.</hi> The Promiſe can do no
great Work upon thy heart, to humble thee, to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:165610:27"/>
to quiet thee; Is it for want of Fulneſs and
Truth therein? not at all: but meerly for want of
Faith in thee, that keeps it off. Men complain, That
were it not for ſuch things, and ſuch things, they
could Believe; when it is their Uubelief that caſts
thoſe rubs in the way. As if a man ſhould caſt Nails
and ſharp Stones in his own way, and ſay, Verily I

when he continues himſelf to caſt them there. You

grieved for the hardneſs of their hearts:</hi> Mark 3. 5. And
as it is bitter to him in the Root, ſo alſo in the Fruit.
Our <hi>Staggerings</hi> and Debates when we have a Word
of Promiſe; is a Grief to his holy Spirit, as the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindeſt
return we can make unto his Love.</p>
            <p>2 <hi>It provoks him. How can this be,</hi> (ſayes <hi>Zechariah)</hi>
that I ſhould have a Son? This ſhall be, (ſaith the
Lord) and thou thy ſelf for thy queſtioning ſhalt be
a ſign of it, <hi>Thou ſhalt be dumb and not ſpeak:</hi> Luke 1.
His Doubting was a Provocation: And our Saviour
expreſſes no leſs in that bitter reproof to his Diſciples
upon their wavering, <hi>Matth. 17. 17. O faithleſs and perverſe
Generation, how long ſhall I be with you? How long ſhall I ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
you? How long ſhall I ſuffer you?</hi> That is, in this Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believing
frame. Poor Souls are apt to admire the
patience of God in other matters; That he ſpared
them in ſuch and ſuch ſins, at ſuch and ſuch times of
Danger, but his exceeding patience towards them in
their carnal Reaſonings, and fleſhly Objections againſt
Believing; this they admire not. Nay, generally they
think it ſhould be ſo: God would not have them one
ſtep further. Nay, they could be more ſtedfaſt in Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
as they ſuppoſe, might it ſtand with the good
Will of God: when all this while, this fram of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
is the greateſt provocation to the Lord; he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
exerciſes more forbearance, then about this kind
of Unbelief.</p>
            <p>When the <hi>Spyes</hi> had gone into <hi>Canaan,</hi> had ſeen the
Land, and brought of the good Fruit of it, then to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine,
then to queſtion whither God would bring them
into it or no: This cauſed the Lord <hi>to ſwear in his wrath,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:165610:28"/>
that they ſhould not enter into his reſt.</hi> When God hath
brought men to the Borders of Heaven, diſcovered to
them the Riches and Excellency of his Grace, admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
them to enter as Spyes into the Kingdom of Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
then to fall a ſtaggering, whether he intends them
an Entrance or no; is that which lyes heavie on him.
The like may be ſaid of all Promiſed Mercies, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverances
whatſoever.</p>
            <p>That this is a <hi>Provocation,</hi> The Lord hath abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
teſtified, in as much, as for it, he hath oftentimes
ſnatched ſweet morſels from the mouths of men, and
turned aſide the ſtream of Mercies, when it was ready
to flow in upon them. <hi>If</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>you will not believe,
you ſhall not be eſtabliſhed: Iſa.</hi> 7. 9. The very Mercy but
now Promiſed, concerning your deliverance, ſhall be
with-held. Oh ſtop not Succeſs from <hi>Ireland,</hi> by Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief.</p>
            <p>3 <hi>It diſhonors God.</hi> In the cloſe of this Verſe, it is
ſaid, <hi>Abraham was ſtrong in Faith</hi> (or ſtaggered not) <hi>gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
glory to God.</hi> To be eſtabliſhed in Believing, is to
<hi>give God the greateſt glory</hi> poſſible. Every ſtaggering
Thought that ariſeth from this Root of Unbelief,
robs God of his Glory.</p>
            <p>1 It robs him of the <hi>Glory of his Truth. He that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth
not, hath made him a Liar, becauſe he believeth not his
Record:</hi> 1 Joh. 5. 10. Let men pretend what they pleaſe,
(as moſt an end, we give in ſpecious pretences for our
Unbelief) the bottom of all is, The queſtioning of the
Truth of God, in our falſe hearts.</p>
            <p>2 It robs him of <hi>the glory of his Fidelity or Faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi>
in the diſcharge of his Promiſes: <hi>If we confeſs our
ſins, he is faithful to forgive us our ſins:</hi> 1 Joh. 1. 9. He hath
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:165610:29"/>
engaged his faithfulneſs in this buſineſs of the forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of <hi>Iniquities:</hi> He whoſe Right it is, calling that in
Queſtion, calls the faithfulneſs of God in Queſtion.</p>
            <p>3 It robs him of <hi>the Glory of his Grace:</hi> In a word,
If a man ſhould chuſe to ſet himſelf in an univerſal
oppoſition unto God, he can think of no more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendious
way then this. This then is the fruit, this
the advantage of all our ſtaggering, we rob God of
Glory, and our own Souls of Mercy.</p>

                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>5</label> Be aſhamed of, and humbled for, all your ſtagger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
at the Promiſes of God, with all your fleſhly Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonings,
&amp; carnal Contrivances iſſuing therefrom. For
the moſt part, we live upon Succeſſes, not Promiſes:
unleſs we ſee and feel the print of Victories, we will
not Believe. The engagement of God, is almoſt quite
forgotten in our Affairs. We travel on without Chriſt,
like his Mother, and ſuppoſe him only to be in the
croud: but we muſt return to ſeek him where we left
him, or our journying on, will be to no purpoſe.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Job,</hi> after all his complaining had ſeen <hi>the End
of the Lord,</hi> he cryes out, <hi>Now I abhor my ſelf in duſt and
aſhes.</hi> You have ſeen <hi>the End of the Lord</hi> in many of his
Promiſes: Oh that it might prevaile to make you ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor
your ſelves in duſt and aſhes, for all your Carnal
Fears and Corrupt Reaſonings, upon your ſtagger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</p>
            <p>When <hi>David</hi> enjoyed his Promiſed Mercy, he e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially
ſhames himſelf, for every thought of Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief,
that he had whileſt he waited for it: <hi>I ſaid</hi> (ſaith
he) <hi>in my haſte, That all men were Liars.</hi> And now he is
humbled for it. Is this to be thankful, to forget our
provoking Thoughts of Unbelief, when the Mercy
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:165610:29"/>
is enjoyed? The Lord ſet it home upon your Spirits,
and give it to receive it's due manifeſtation.</p>
            <p>1 If there be any Counſels, Deſigns, Contrivances
on foot amongſt us, that are bottomed on our Stagger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at the Promiſe under which we are, Oh let them
be inſtantly caſt down to the ground. Let not any be
ſo fooliſh, as to ſuppoſe that Unbelief will be a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
for quiet Habitations. You are careful to avoid
all wayes that might diſhonor you, as the Rulers of ſo
great a Nation: Oh be much more careful about ſuch
things as will diſhonor you as Believers: That's your
greateſt Title, That's your chiefeſt Priviledge. Search
your own Thoughts, and if any Contrivance, any
Complyance be found ſpringing up, whoſe ſeed was
ſown by ſtaggering at the Promiſe; root them up,
and caſt them out, before it be too late.</p>
            <p>2 Engage your hearts againſt all ſuch wayes for the
future: Say unto God, How faithful art thou in all
thy wayes! How able to perform all thy Promiſes!
How haſt thou eſtabliſhed thy Word in Heaven and
Earth! Who would not put their Truſt in thee? We
deſire to be aſhamed, That ever we ſhould admit in
our hearts, the leaſt ſtaggering at the ſtability of thy
Word.</p>
            <p>3 Act as men bottomed upon <hi>unſhaken things:</hi> that

<hi>He that believeth, will not make haſte:</hi> be not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty

as you are in the way of God, and do the Work of
