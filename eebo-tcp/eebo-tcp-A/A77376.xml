            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S no Nation in the World hath been exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed
(in ſo ſhort a tract of time) with more
prodigious Revolutions then <hi>England;</hi> ſo
is it as admirable to obſerve the manifold
aſtoniſhing Providences that are the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comitants
of ſuch marvellous and frequent Alterations in
this State and Commonwealth. The <hi>Spirit of the living
Creature</hi> hath <hi>moved in this great Wheel:</hi> This <hi>Buſh hath
been often a fire,</hi> but hitherto <hi>not conſumed:</hi> God doth
often threaten and ſhake his angry rod over, yet ſeems
unwilling to ruine theſe Nations. And albeit the firſt
Part is always acted on the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Stage, the <hi>Iriſh</hi> and
<hi>Scotiſh</hi> Nations are ſo far influenced thereby, that they
become participants more or leſs in her Peace or War,
in her proſperity and adverſity. To demonſtrate this
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:119369:3"/>
truth, We having (as we hope) been ſet on work by the
Lord, in the contriving and execution of the late Change
in <hi>Ireland,</hi> by the evil reports we have heard of that ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
ſince our repair to this City, finding it neceſſary,
have thought it our duty to expoſe to publike view this
Narrative of the dealings of God with the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Nation;
to prevent and remove thoſe diſingenuous Miſinformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
caſt upon that action, by ſundry diſaffected perſons
to the Parliaments cauſe and intereſt, and whoſe malevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
aſpects did eminently contribute to their late Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption,
or to the continuance of it. And waving all
former actions, ſhall only reflect upon thoſe that have
been immediately previous, or attending, or ſucceeding
that great Enterpriſe in <hi>Ireland.</hi> And this we ſhall do
faithfully, and ſuccinctly.</p>
            <p>The laying aſide the <hi>Single Perſon,</hi> was the bringing in
the <hi>Parliament;</hi> which after ſome years diſcontinuance,
was in <hi>May</hi> 1659. reſtored to the exerciſe of their power
by the Army in <hi>England,</hi> and after owned with general
acclamations and Addreſſes from all places, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
from <hi>Ireland.</hi> The honor of which univerſal com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance
from the Army to the Parliament, was ſnatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
away by a ſort of people, whoſe affections to the
<hi>wages of unrighteouſneſs,</hi> hath characterized them in all
the three Nations; and did appropriate that to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
alone, blaſting as Malignants others really zealous
in that great work: They who were beſt affected to the
Parliament, and moſt forward in their Addreſſes, being
by thoſe men branded as Enemies to the Parliament,
under the notion of having once adhered to the Single
Perſon, although the owning that power in the Single
Perſon, had been in them nothing more then what had
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:119369:3"/>
been in the generality of the three Nations, and that after
(to a general ſatisfaction) obliterated by an <hi>Act of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dempnity:</hi>
And notwithſtanding that having had prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and advantages above others by the Single Perſon,
none had been more forward in adoring that very power
in the Single Perſon, then thoſe very men, who after ſo
upbraided it as a crime in others. Theſe very men were
they, who above others rejoiced in the diſſolving the
Parliament by the <hi>Protector</hi> in the year 1653. And theſe
were they who were for the <hi>Riſing Sun,</hi> and were emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently
induſtrious in framing and carrying on <hi>Addreſſes</hi>
to it, from all places; after all which, having with the
Adulterous woman wiped their mouths, they ſay, <hi>We
have done no wickedneſs.</hi> And ſtrange it is, even to aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
how they gained belief with that very Parliament,
on which they (even they) had ſo trampled: And that
notwithſtanding all the evils, then, and after breaking
out upon the Nations, flowed from themſelves actually,
or occaſionally; yet were they eſteemed <hi>Children of peace,</hi>
nay <hi>Sufferers,</hi> and all thoſe evils charged upon others.
And it is to be admired (theſe things conſidered) by
what artifices they ſhould ſo winde themſelves into almoſt
a Supremacie of power in <hi>Ireland,</hi> kept under them in
very vaſſalage, whereby in the after-change <hi>England</hi> it
ſelf might have been hazarded. Nor will it be from the
purpoſe, to obſerve in part the Method artificially pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
in, for carrying on their deſtructive deſigns, almoſt
unobſerved until the three Nations had been in the evils
thereof well-nigh overwhelmed.</p>
            <p>Firſt, they laboured the ſecuring to themſelves the
Army in <hi>Ireland,</hi> in the modelling thereof in <hi>England,</hi>
they having the nomination, and preſenting all Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:119369:4"/>
Officers, who were ſuch as for the moſt part were
fixed to their Intereſts, in whatſoever Changes; ſo as of
more then forty Field-Officers, there were but a very few
but what carried on their deſigns; In the mean while ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding
by miſinformations (ſecret and at diſtance) Sir
<hi>Hardreſs Waller,</hi> Sir <hi>Charls Coote,</hi> Colonel <hi>Ingoldsby,</hi> Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel
<hi>Theophilus Jones,</hi> Colonel <hi>Flower,</hi> Colonel <hi>Redman,</hi>
Major <hi>Eyres,</hi> Lieutenant Colonel. <hi>Bret,</hi> Major <hi>Read,</hi> Major
<hi>Stanley,</hi> and others of known integrity, and all this by
falſe ſuggeſtions of Colonel <hi>Axtel,</hi> Colonel <hi>Barrow,</hi> Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel
<hi>Sankey,</hi> Mr. <hi>Roberts,</hi> Doctor <hi>Worſley,</hi> Doctor <hi>Hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
&amp;c. then in <hi>London,</hi> and moſt of them after haſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
into <hi>Ireland,</hi> for compleating there what remained of
the modelling that Army, as to inferior Officers.</p>
            <p>Secondly, they ſingled out, and gained perſons to be
entruſted with the Government of the Army and Nation
fitted for their turn, ſuch were Lieutenant General <hi>Lud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,</hi>
Colonel <hi>Jones,</hi> Mr. <hi>Corbet,</hi> and Colonel <hi>Thomlinſon,</hi>
by which their Inſtruments (rather then Maſters) they in
effect ruled, and thereby fixed in themſelves, and in the
hands of their Confidents the principal places of ſtrength
in the Nation, victualling each place with three months
proviſion, together with the County Militiaes, and even
the management alſo of civil things, as to Sheriffs, Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of Peace &amp;c. By all which, 'tis moſt apparent, <hi>Ireland</hi>
was intended for their place of refuge, in their diſtreſs
elſewhere, and ſo had it been found to the diſturbance of
the three Nations, had Lieutenant General <hi>Ludlow</hi> in this
juncture been admitted (as he hoped) into his former com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
he having been ſent for to that end from <hi>London,</hi>
by that party in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and ſent thence to that purpoſe
by expreſs orders from the Lord <hi>Fleetwood.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:119369:4"/>
Thirdly, that part of the Army in <hi>England</hi> under their
apoſtatized General, having contrary to all Faith and Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance
in <hi>October</hi> laſt, again diſturbed the Parliaments
ſitting; it was then the time for that party in <hi>Ireland,</hi> to
put in practice what had been before deſigned; whereunto
indeed they ſeemed to be now neceſſitated, for their new
created General had ordered by his Letters to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander
in cheif of the Parliaments forces in <hi>Ireland,</hi> that
ſubſcriptions ſhould be taken throughout the Army, for
owning the Lord <hi>Fleetwood</hi> as General, and Colonel <hi>Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert</hi>
as Major General &amp;c. though in direct oppoſition to
the Parliament, who enacted and declared to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;
it being further by ſuch ſubſcriptions intended that
the Army in <hi>Ireland</hi> ſhould be engaged for the Army in
<hi>England</hi> againſt the Parliament.</p>
            <p>The Lord <hi>Fleetwood</hi> had then required as aforeſaid an
Election of Agents out of each Regiment, to be ſent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>England</hi> for aſſiſting with others in framing, propoſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and impoſing a new Model of Government for the
three Nations &amp;c. to the ſubvertion of the fundamental
Laws, and the very being of Parliaments, and the Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of the good people of theſe Nations in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>Herein is Lieutenant General <hi>Ludlow</hi> active in <hi>London,</hi>
by his Letters to his ſubſtitute Colonel <hi>Jones,</hi> and to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
in <hi>Ireland;</hi> herein are Colonel <hi>Jones,</hi> Mr. <hi>Corbet,</hi> and
Colonel <hi>Thomlinſon,</hi> concurring and acting vigorouſly;
therein falſifying their Faith to the Parliament, contrary
to the high truſt as Commiſſioners of Parliament repoſed
in them, which their former Title of Commiſſioners of
Parliament, they caſt off, aſſuming another of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners
of the Commonwealth, that their Guilt be
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:119369:5"/>
not read in their Forehead, and in the Front of publick
Declarations &amp;c. And by all of them orders tranſmitted
into the ſeveral Quarters for haſting the ſubſcriptions and
Elections mentioned.</p>
            <p>For prevention whereof, or giving at leaſt ſome ſtop to
ſuch their pernicious actings againſt the Parliament, and
for preſerving (if it might be) the Parliaments intereſt in
<hi>Ireland,</hi> about <hi>October</hi> laſt it was from the Lord on the
Spirits of his Servants (ſome diſſenting Officers about
<hi>Dublin</hi>) to conſider of ſome probable meanes to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
            <p>But the Danger being evident that there ſhould be
meetings of ſuch who declared diſſatisfactions and diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
from ſuch acting, and proteſted publickly againſt ſuch
deſignes againſt the Parliament; therefore the ſaid diſſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Officers for giving ſome colour to their waies, with
leſs jealouſie, pretended the carrying on a Petition to
the Commander in chief, Colonel <hi>Jones,</hi> for a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
Councel of Officers to meet at <hi>Dublin</hi> to conſider of
thoſe great and weighty affairs, wherein three Nations
were ſo highly concerned; by which general Councel (if
meeting) it was hoped that a check might be given to the
other party, and that the hands of the diſſenters might
be ſtrengthned for the Parliament; or if ſuch a general
meeting of Officers on ſuch an occaſion ſhould have bin
denyed by the Commander in Chief, it would probably
returne on him and his wayes with greater diſadvantage;
and in the mean time it was conceived that the private
meetings of the ſaid Diſſenting Officers, might be with
leſs ſuſpition, ſuppoſed to be in order to the matter only
of their Petition mentioned: And for giving yet more
countenance to this their deſigne, it was by them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:119369:5"/>
that Sir <hi>Hardreſs Waller</hi> the Major General,
ſhould be moved to appeare in the head of them, before
the Commander in chief and the Commiſſioners of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
for ſetting forward that deſire for a general
Councel of Officers; which he freely promiſed to do,
And for gaining to themſelves a party abroad under the
ſame covert of a Petition for a general Councel of Officers,
the ſaid Diſſenting Officers ſent out into the ſeveral
Quarters a Petition to be ſubſcribed to that purpoſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

he reſolveth on a Complying with that therein pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
by the Diſſenting Officers before the Petition was
delivered; Yet to make it inſignificant to their ends, he
had fixed for that purpoſe on the meeting of thoſe new
elected Officers appointed for the meeting in <hi>England,</hi> who
within few dayes were expected in <hi>Dublin,</hi> and were ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
perſons made for that purpoſe, and that by this
meanes alſo his ſo yielding to the Petitioners, might prove
an expedient for ſtopping their further proſecution of that
their Petition in other places, that hereby the ſaid Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting
Officers might be rendered ſecure, until they ſhould
be ſurpriſed and laid up ſafe; which he intended at the
coming in of his Juncto of Officers, whom he expected;
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:119369:6"/>
for he the ſaid Colonel <hi>Jones</hi> had to that end adviſed with
General <hi>Fleetwood,</hi> who by his Letters intercepted, ordered
the ſecuring them the Diſſenting Officers, and the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arming
all others in the Nation not of their party.</p>
            <p>The ſaid Diſſenting Officers being now awakened and
ſenſible of the danger to themſelves, but principally of that
threatned to the three Nations, and the Parliaments In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
therein, they thereupon found it neceſſary to put
ſpeedily in Execution, although but with few hands, what
had bin before reſolved; in order whereunto on the 12. of
<hi>December</hi> laſt they fixed their Reſolution, for acting the
very next day to the ſeizing, and ſecuring the Caſtle of
<hi>Dublin;</hi> and of thoſe the Parliaments Commiſſioners ſo
Perfidiouſly acting againſt their truſt.</p>
            <p>Some difficulties interpoſed in the manner, particularly
that of five Companies of Foot Quartered in <hi>Dublin,</hi> four
being of Colonel <hi>Lawrences</hi> Regiment, and three Troops
of Horſe brought in by Collonel <hi>Jones</hi> for the ſecurity of
the Caſtle and thoſe of his party, not any one of them
had bin hitherto prepared for the work. The perſons alſo
managing that work to Execution were but few (<hi>viz</hi>)
Colonel <hi>Bridges,</hi> Major <hi>Edward Warren,</hi> Leivtenant
Colonel <hi>John Warren,</hi> Captain <hi>Abel Warren,</hi> Leivtenant
<hi>John Thompſon,</hi> Colonel <hi>Theophilus Jones,</hi> Captain
<hi>Jeonar,</hi> Captain <hi>Daniel Liſle,</hi> Colonel <hi>Warden,</hi> and
Captain <hi>Bond,</hi> by whoſe Foot Company then upon an
outgard the Caſtle was ſurpriſed; notwithſtanding which,
and many other difficulties, the Perſons mentioned com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
the Parliaments Cauſe in their hands to the Lord,
and willingly offering up themſelves, and all deare unto
them for a reaſonable Sacrifice to the publick, according
to former reſolutions on the 13 <hi>December</hi> about five of the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:119369:6"/>
Clock in the afternoon they firſt Surpriſed the Caſtle,
wherein but the very day before was laid up 500. Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels
of Powder newly landed, beſides the former ſtore,
and intended for other ends; they afterward ſecured
Colonel <hi>Jones,</hi> Cheif Baron <hi>Corbet,</hi> and Colonel
<hi>Thomlinſon,</hi> the Commiſſioners before mentioned; and
having declared for the Parliament throughout the
City of <hi>Dublin,</hi> they were met with general Accla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations
from the higheſt to the loweſt, both Army and
others, expreſſing all joy, except ſuch as were of the
Adverſe party; and all this through mercy without
one drop of Blood, or ſo much as Tumult. This
whole work was begun and perfected within leſs then
two houres, and within leſs then ſo many weeks, in
like manner almoſt throughout the whole Nation;
And the very ſame night Colonel <hi>Edmond Temple,</hi>
received Orders for imbodying of five Troops of Horſe,
with which he afterward reduced Collonel <hi>Pritty,</hi> then
ſtanding out againſt the Parliament in <hi>Catherlo Castle.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It now behoving thoſe thus ingaged to put themſelves
into that order whereby the work in their hands might
be carryed on (by the bleſſing of the Lord) the more
Proſperouſly, and conſidering the countenance they
might have in that action by the Major General, if
he would own them in it, they thereupon deſired his
heading them, and that by his hand Orders might paſs
upon all occaſions, he being the viſible Superior Officer
then in <hi>Ireland,</hi> whereunto (they, and that under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking
appearing for the Parliament) he aſſented: he
having been ſome weeks before prepared by ſome ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
diſcourſe concerning it.</p>

After upon the Fourteenth of <hi>December,</hi> was pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed
the Declaration for the Parliament, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
tranſmitted by the Poſt into all parts, with the
particulars of the ſucceſs, which the Lord was plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
to give unto them his poor weak Inſtruments in
his Service, they had thereupon daily returnes of joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
approbations, and the owning of their work and
profeſſion for the Parliament againſt all oppoſition;
and herein is to be remembred to the honor of the City
of <hi>Dublin,</hi> the readineſs and alacrity manifeſted in this
work by the Mayor and Citizens, generally, both
in the firſt taking of the buſineſs, the very firſt night,
and afterwards drawing the City Militia into the field,
which conſiſted of about 2000 foot, beſide horſe,
for the ſervice of the Parliament, and ſtill holding on
with that faithfulneſs and zeal which can be expected
from them.</p>
            <p>Alſo Sir <hi>Charles Coot</hi> Lord Preſident of <hi>Connaught,</hi>
having caſt off the Subſcriptions expected from him and
his Forces in that Province, his Lordſhip with his party
declared for the Parliament, and ſecured the Town of
<hi>Galway,</hi> and thoſe therein, refuſing to joyn with him
in owning the Parliament; his Lordſhip did after re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
Colonel <hi>Brafield,</hi> rendezvouzing and holding out
the Caſtle of <hi>Athlone</hi> againſt the Parliament, and in a
ſhort time, ſetled the whole Province, and ſignified
by Letters to the Officers in <hi>Dublin,</hi> that he was ready
with his forces, for what ſhould be further for the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments
ſervice.</p>
            <p>The like Affairs of the Province of <hi>Munſter,</hi> was
carried on by the management of the Lord <hi>Broghill,</hi> who
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:119369:7"/>
with great care and dilligence, ſecured <hi>Youghall, Bandon,
Kinſale</hi> and other places conſiderable: The City of
<hi>Cork</hi> alſo declared for the Parliament, by meanes of the
Citizens and private Soldiers, notwithſtanding that
Colonel <hi>Phayer</hi> the Governor there, with Colonel <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis,</hi>
and others of that party, had laboured much to
the contrary, was ſecured by Major <hi>Wilſon,</hi> whoſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour
was eminent: Alſo <hi>Limerick</hi> and <hi>Waterford</hi> by
Lieutenant Colonel <hi>Leigh,</hi> who appeared faithful to the
Parliament in that great ſtreight.</p>
            <p>As to <hi>Vlſter, Londonderry</hi> being ſecured by Colonel
<hi>Gorges,</hi> there was little remaining in that Province of
conſiderable oppoſition; all there being ſoon quieted,
eſpecially on the deceaſe of Colonel <hi>Cooper,</hi> Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor
of that Province, who died in his Chair about the
21. of <hi>December.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Matters being thus, through the Bleſſing of God, in
ſome goodmeaſure ordered at home, the Councel of Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers
in <hi>Dublin,</hi> now ſettle themſelves on diſpatches a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad,
as for giving a right underſtanding of themſelves
and their Proceedings, ſo for ſtrengthning as they
hoped, the hands of their Friends elſewhere, coopera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
in the ſame cauſe with them, and accordingly they
did by ſeveral Expreſſes, give a particular accompt to
General <hi>Monck</hi> in <hi>Scotland;</hi> alſo to the Parliaments
Commiſſioners of the Army in <hi>Portſmouth,</hi> and to the
Lord Mayor of <hi>London.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And for the better carrying on the work, the Lord
<hi>Broghill,</hi> and the Lord Preſident of <hi>Connaught,</hi> were
deſired by the Council of Officers to repair to <hi>Dublin,</hi>
on whoſe Judgment and prudent management of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:119369:8"/>
they much depended; by whoſe coming were
their Councels and actings more enlivened, and all
others better ſatisfied. And for ſecuring the Army
to the Parliaments intereſts, and that the endeavors
of thoſe attempting the contrary might be prevented,
It was for that end concluded as abſolutely neceſſary,
that the Army in <hi>Ireland</hi> ſhould be forthwith ſetled,
by removing thoſe from Commands who were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>affected
to the Parliament, and placing others in their
room, of whoſe good affections to the Parliament
they might be confident. Therefore did the Council
of Officers ſet themſelves upon a temporary model<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Army, until the Parliaments pleaſure ſhould
be therein known; hoping that their end in it (purely
the Service of the Parliament) would be accepted:
In which their ſaid Model were laid aſide only ſuch
as oppoſed the Parliament in the Revolutions in
<hi>England,</hi> or here, or of whoſe not acting againſt the
Parliament they could not be ſatisfied: And ſuch
only as ſhewed themſelves friends to the Parliament,
were imployed.</p>
            <p>On the 31. of <hi>December,</hi> came into the Bay of
<hi>Dublin</hi> Lieutenant-General <hi>Ludlow,</hi> who from aboard
the <hi>Oxford</hi>-Frigat ſignified his being there, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
admittance to the head of the Army as Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander
in chief, which he had by Commiſſion from
the Parliament before its interruption. Whereunto,
for the reaſons before mentioned, as alſo for many
other cauſes, all expreſſed in a Charge already exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited
againſt the ſaid Lieutenant-General <hi>Ludlow</hi> and
others to the Parliament; It was therefore reſolved,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:119369:8"/>
That it was not conſiſtent with the ſafety of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments
Intereſt in <hi>Ireland,</hi> that Lieutenant-General
<hi>Ludlow</hi> ſhould be received into the Head of the
Army, until the Parliaments pleaſure, on hearing of
what ſhould be objected to him, ſhould be ſignified
concerning him.</p>
            <p>And in regard of his ſo hovering in the Bay of
<hi>Dublin,</hi> whereby he was at hand in order to diſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
in the City, which was threatned and expected
by his party there, who might be conſiderable if head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by thoſe Officers then priſoners at <hi>Dublin,</hi> ſecured
for their oppoſition to the Parliament, and conceived
dangerous by reaſon of their intereſts and diſaffection
to the Parliament; therefore did the Council of Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers
conceive it neceſſary, that the priſoners then
in the City ſhould be diſperſed and diſpoſed into
places more remote, particularly Colonel <hi>John Jones</hi>
was thereupon removed to the Caſtle of <hi>Athlone,</hi> and
others elſwhere.</p>
            <p>And whereas <hi>Miles Corbet</hi> Eſquire, and Colonel
<hi>Thomlinſon,</hi> had in their reſtraint the favor of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finement
to their houſes, until the Parliaments plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
concerning them ſhould be known, reſpect being
had to the Charge to be preſented againſt them alſo;
and that he the ſaid Mr. <hi>Corbet</hi> had fled to Lieutenant-General
<hi>Ludlow</hi> then in the Bay of <hi>Dublin;</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
was Colonel <hi>Thomlinſon</hi> removed, and for
better ſecurity of his perſon, reſtrained in the Caſtle
of <hi>Dublin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And having thus far proceeded in ſetling and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing
the Parliaments Intereſt and Authority in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:119369:9"/>
It was alſo judged expedient by the Major-General
and Council of Officers there, during the
Parliaments interruption, to take ſome ſpeedy order
(in regard of the preſſing neceſſity of the Army, then
ſixteen moneths behind of their pay) for the raiſing
of money for the preſent maintenance of them. The
Council of Officers did adviſe, That two perſons of
each County, and the like number of each City and
chief Town, ſhould be elected by the Proteſtant in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants
of the ſaid places, and the Electors and
Elected to be ſuch perſons as always manifeſted their
good affections to the Parliament, and not then in
Arms; who were to meet in <hi>Dublin</hi> ſo to raiſe money
by way of Loan, for the temporary ſupply of the
Forces, that ſo they might not periſh, nor be expoſed
to the many temptations that ſuch a condition may
leave them open unto, and alſo to prevent the Free-quartering
of the Army upon the Inhabitants of the
Country, a grievance not long to be borne. But with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
a few days after, they having received information
of the Parliaments ſitting, which came to them ſome
days before the meeting of that Convention; the
Council of Officers ſent forth their Diſpatches into
all Counties and places to ſtop ſuch meeting, which
was accordingly done. And this is the true accompt
of the proceedings in this affair, which hath made ſo
great a noiſe in this City, as if they in <hi>Ireland</hi> were
ſetting up for themſelves, and calling a Parliament
to govern and manage the affairs of that Nation, in
oppoſition to the Parliament of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:119369:9"/>
And for giving the Parliament a due repreſentation
of the State of theſe Affairs in <hi>Ireland,</hi> the Council
of Officers there have choſen, and ordered us to be
their Commiſſioners to attend the Parliament for that
purpoſe; and to indeavour to rid that Army from the
inſulting Pride and Bondage, under which they had
groaned by an Anabaptiſtical, and Notionall Party,
from whom proceeded all thoſe confuſions, and revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions
this Parliament and Commonwealth have been
exerciſed, which for ſome years paſt, whoſe caſting
out as to their over-ruling Power in <hi>Ireland,</hi> (if owned
by the Parliament) may be (it is hoped) to the other
Nations, a deliverance alſo from the like future evils
by that kinde of men.</p>
            <closer>And thus with much integrity and faithfulneſs, unto
that Army whereof we are unworthy Members, have
we given a juſt accompt of what the Lord hath done
in that Nation for his people, wherein we have pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely
omitted many remarkable Circumſtances that
attended this great action, leaſt we might appear ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
unneceſſarily tedious, or fooliſhly vain glorious;
Whereas our aimes are nakedly and ſincerely, that
God might have the Glory, the Nations ſetled up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
an honeſt Baſis, and that thoſe prejudices that
had been occaſioned againſt the late Proceedings in
that Nation, by the beſpattering reports of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant
Tongues and Pens, might be removed
or ſilenced; So we deſire, that all that fear God,
and honor Magiſtracy and good Government, would
joyn with us in bleſſing our gracious God, whoſe
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:119369:10"/>
ways are inſcrutable for delivering that and theſe Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
from the raging power of a devouring Sword; and
that our ſupplications may be united for the ſettlement
of Peace, with Truth among us; That every one may
ſit under his own Vine and Fig-Tree, none making
them affraid.
