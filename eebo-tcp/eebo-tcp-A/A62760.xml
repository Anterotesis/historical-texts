            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THus long <hi>(GREAT SIR)</hi> our unparallel'd late Deliverance wrought by the Hand of God, the Firſt Mover, the Principal Author of all our Good, hath hitherto moſt juſtly employed all the Faculties of our Souls in the profound contemplation of his myſterious and unbounded Providence, receiving from us the ſlender Reward, but neceſſary Sacrifice of our hearty Praiſe and Thanks; But now to You <hi>(GREAT SIR)</hi> the next recollected Thought with equal Juſtice does belong: To You therefore <hi>(DREAD SIR)</hi> the Second Cauſe, our Faith's Defender, the wonderful Reſtorer of our captiv'd Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties; in greateſt Humility, but with unlimited Zeal, and joyful Hearts full of ſincere Affection, we yield our utmoſt and unfeigned Thanks, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the only thing valuable which our Enemies left us wherewithal to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, and of which their Malice could not rob us. We cannot but with Horror ſtand amazed, when we recount our never to be forgotten Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, our frequent cauſeleſs Impriſonments, the plundering our Goods; the confiſcation of our Eſtates; the innumerable Oppreſſions, the illegal Exactions, the tyrannous hatred of our Perſons; and, in a word, the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian behaviour in all the actions of our Enemies infinitely ſurpaſſing an <hi>Egyptian</hi> ſervitude, when <hi>Baal</hi>'s Prieſts contented not themſelves with their Idolatry alone to pollute our Altars, but in proſecution of their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane and ungodly Malice, contriv'd the leading us captive to our Churches; and each Anceſtor's Tomb became our reſpective Couches; then it proved litterally true, that our Liberties were offered a <hi>Romiſh</hi> Sacrifice on our own Altars. Thus far Almighty God permitted them: Then it was that our Enemies grew ripe for Divine vengeance: Then it was that You; <hi>(MIGHTY SIR)</hi> ſtept in, and by Your own Victorious Arm; to the hazard of Your Royal Perſon, reſcued us from the hands of our Enemies: Then, and not till then, did Arbitrary Power, Popery and Slavery (terms almoſt convertible) receive their period. Wherefore to You <hi>(DREAD SIR)</hi> our only King, our Lives; our Liberties; our Goods and Eſtates we humbly offer, and at Your Royal Feet <hi>(GREAT SIR)</hi> we come prepared ready to lay them down for the Defence of Your Majeſties Royal Perſon, for the ſuppreſſion of Popery, for the maintenance of the Proteſtant Religion, and for the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of Your Majeſties undoubted Right to theſe Your Kingdoms and Dominions. In teſtimony whereof, we have cauſed the common Seal of the ſaid City to be hereunto affixed this Ninth day of <hi>July,</hi> in the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Year of Your Majeſties Reign.</p>
