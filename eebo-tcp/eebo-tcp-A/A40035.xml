         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

to diſreſpect the publick Preachers of the Goſpel, upon the account of their
maintenance, for food and raiment convenient for them for preaching, they had
need be upon infallible grounds, <hi>Firſt,</hi> That they are true Miniſters of Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,
ſent forth by him to preach the everlaſting Goſpel. <hi>Secondly,</hi> That their lives and
practices are agreeable to the Goſpel Miniſters in the primitive times; and <hi>Thirdly,</hi>
that Tithes are the undoubted maintenance for ſuch Miniſters, before ever they
ſhould have proceeded to the impriſonment of mens bodies, and forcing from them
their eſtates, for not paying of them; and if you cannot all manifeſt your ſelves by
theſe things, then give me leave to tll you all, you are deceivers, and not Goſpel-preachers,
and the Lord will require the blood of the innocent at your hands. But
I ſhal come to the queſtion propounded by thee, and examine thy proofs for tythes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſtion,</hi> Whether it be convenient, that the preſent way of the maintenance of Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
or Preachers of the Goſpel be removed and taken away, or changed into ſome
other proviſion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Which Queflion thou haſt in eight particular anſwered, and towards the cloſe of
thy Anſwer ſaieſt;</hi> That to take away the publick maintenance, <hi>viz.</hi> the Tithes, provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
as thou ſaiſt, in the providence of God for the publick diſpenſers of the Goſpel, upon
pretences of preſent inconvenience, or promiſes of future proviſion, is a contempt of the care
and faithfulneſs of God towards his Church, aud is in plain terms down-right robbery.
<hi>And further thou ſaiſt, that to entitle a Nation unto ſuch an action, by impoſing it
on them without their conſent, is down-right oppreſſion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. I ſhall firſt ſpeak to the Queſtion propounded, and in anſwer thereunto, do
poſitively affirm, and ſay contrarily, That the preſent way of maintenance for Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters
by Tithes, is not onely a great oppreſſion, and intollerable in a Chriſtian
Common-wealth, or amongſt men profeſſing Chriſt Jeſus to be their King, Prieſt,
and Prophet, but alſo Antichriſtian, and contrary to the maintenance and practice
of Goſpel-miniſters: And that not to remove ſuch an oppreſſion, were little leſs,
in plain Engliſh, then direct robbery, or to uphold wickedneſs by a Law, God ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
appointed no ſuch maintenance for Goſpel-preachers, but is a maintenance, as
you may read, ſet up by Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> the tenth, in the year 1211. and not by Chriſt,
nor was it ever practiſed by the Apoſtles or Diſciples of Chriſt in the primitive
times: And <hi>Cook</hi> in the <hi>third part of his Inſtitutes</hi> alſo teſtifies, that Tenths and
Firſt-fruits are but a late Innovation, aud claimed by the Pope as Succeſſor to the
Jewiſh High-prieſt: and Doctor <hi>Seamor,</hi> one of your own Divines confeſſed before
the Committee of Parliament, in the year 1653. that their Call to the miniſtry
had its <gap reason="illegible: smudged" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

               </gap> firſt riſe from the Pope of <hi>Rome;</hi> it follows then, your maintenance
muſt be from thence alſo.</p>
            <p>Now that Tithes is an oppreſſion and an unrighteous thing, examine the ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of diverſe of the Mattyrs in Queen <hi>Maries</hi> daies, recorded by <hi>Fox</hi> in his Acts
and Monuments, as <hi>John Wickliffe, Walter Brute, William Thorp,</hi> and others, who
ſuffered in flames for their teſtimony againſt Tithes: And that this Age is not without
a faithful teſtimony. See the ſufferings of the Chriſtians until death in our daies; as
<hi>Thomas Bromby, John Caſon, William Sykes, William Tucker, Stephen Yaton, Arnold
Trueblood, William Serjeant,</hi> and others, who in ſeveral Goals of this Nation finiſhed
their teſtimony alſo againſt Tithes, by ſuffering impriſonment until death, and thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands
by ſpoiling of their goods<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Who is there almoſt that i but ſober amongſt is,
or that dares approve himſelf to be a Chriſtian, but hath, or will give his teſtimony
againſt Tithes, and ſay, 'tis a burthen intollerable to be born by all that <gap reason="illegible: poor copy" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:106951:2"/>
But becauſe I deſire that the truth may prevail, and that it may be made manifeſt
to all that have but a ſeeing eye, or a hearing ear; I ſhall examine the ſtrength of thy
proofs by thoſe very Scriptures which thou haſt quoted to prove Tithes a fit main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
for the publick diſpenſers of the Goſpell.</p>
            <p>Thy firſt proof is 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 4. in which place the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>They that preach the
Goſpel should live of the Goſpel.</hi> Now I appeal to all indifferent men, that do not
ſuffer the thick vail of falſe Doctrine to remain as ſcales upon their eies, whether this
text pleads for a maintenance by Tithes, or no: If thou hadſt known what it is to
live of the Goſpel, thou wouldſt have cried out againſt the oppreſiing of tender con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences
to maintain thee, and not have cried out to the civil power, for fear that the
oppreſſion ſhould be removed. FRIEND! Is forcing from people the tenth part
of their hard labour and eſtates, to maintain your generation in pride, idleneſs, and
fulneſs of bread, a living of the Goſpel? If this be to live of the Coſpel, 'tis a life
the Apoſtles and true Miniſters of Chriſt never lived, nor their Lord and Maſter never
commanded; who when he ſent forth his Diſciples to preach, charged them not to
take any thing for their journey, nor two coats, no ſcrip, no bread, nor any mony in
their purſes, <hi>Mark</hi> 6. 8, 9. But now you are ſo far from obſerving Chriſts doctrine,
and his commands, that your generation walk quite contrary: for inſtead of going
forth without proviſion, you will not go forth unleſs it be well aſſured unto you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-hand.
The true laborers in Chriſts Vineyard, I ſay, never contracted for a ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled
maintenance, nor divined for money, as you do; but as they had freely receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
ſo they freely gave, and when they had done Chriſts work, received Chriſts
wages, but not compelled peoples eſtates from them, nor for being unwilling to part
with it, caſt their bodies into priſon, as many of you have done. Now Friend, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
thou art ignorant of Chriſts doctrine, and of the Goſpel-miniſters mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
as alſo of the Apoſtles words before by thee quoted, I ſhall let thee know,
that to live of the Goſpel, is to receive what is freely adminiſtred unto thee: <hi>Or
thus:</hi> The true Miniſters of the Goſpel firſt plant a Vineyard, and then partake of
the fruit thereof: <hi>Or thus,</hi> They receive temporal hings of thoſe to whom they ſow
ſpiritual things, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 11. Yet (leſt any ſhould be miſtaken, as though the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
would be ſo mainteined) the Apoſtle ſaith, I have uſed none of theſe things,
neither have I written theſe things, that it ſhould be ſo done unto me, <hi>verſ.</hi> 15. By
which thou feeſt plainly, that the Apoſtle and true Miniſter of the Goſpel, was no
mercenary Preacher nor hireling, but freely as he had received, ſo he freely gave:
he was ſo far from compelling any to maintain him for preaching, as your fraterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
do, that he denied his Chriſtian liberty, and wrought with his hands: I ſay,
<hi>Paul</hi> ſought for no reward from men for preaching the Goſpel, as you all do, but
ſaith he, If I do this thing willingly, I have my reward; and what is my reward,
ſaith he, verily this, <hi>That when I preach the Goſpel, I may make the Goſpel of Chriſt
without charge, that I abuſe not my power in the Goſpel,</hi> ver. 18.</p>
            <p>Now let all the world of unbelievers ſee, how contrary the practice of the
Miniſters of the Church of <hi>England</hi> is from the true Miniſters of Chriſt, and how
chargeable your Goſpel is, even ſo dear hath it been made to ſome, that it hath
coſt them their lives in naſty priſons, when as the true Miniſters Goſpel is without
charge, and is freely preached to all that will receive it. And ſaith the true Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,
<hi>Hoe, every one that thirſteth, come to the waters, and buy wine and milk without mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
and without price:</hi> This is the voice of the true Prophets of the Lord, but the
falſe Prophets they look for their gain from their quarters: <hi>And even as Troops of
Robbers wait for a man, ſo do they murther in the way by conſent,</hi> Hoſea 6. 9.</p>
            <p>Thy next proof for Tithes is this, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 6. the words of the Apoſtle are theſe;
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:106951:3"/>
               <hi>Let him that is taught in the Word, communicate unto him that teacheth, in all good
things.</hi> Truly, Friend, wer't not thou wilfully blind, or willingly ignorant, thou
wouldſt not prodnce this text to prove Tithes a lawful maintenance for Goſpel-mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters,
but wouldſt ingeniouſly confeſs, and in ſingleneſs of heart ſay, This is from
the text, and Tithes are Antichriſtian. There needs no other confutation of
thee herein, then the aming of the words themſelves, which I recommend to thy
review, and all mens elſe who can but read Engliſh. <hi>Friend,</hi> be not deceived, nor do
thou any longer endeavour to deceive others: for though thou maiſt do ſo, yet
the Lord will not be mocked, nor the true Chriſtians deluded by ſuch lines of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion
and palpable darkneſs, as thou wouldſt draw over the minds and the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings
of the civil powers of the earth, who have drunk down error for truth,
even as the fiſhes drink water: and this they and other ſilly people do, under the
ſpecious pretences of your being Miniſters of the Goſpel, when as in truth the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel
of Chriſt you are ſtrangers unto, and ſo are ignorant of its maintenance.
Bee adviſed by a lover of the truth, to learn wiſdom, and no longer to make a trade
of the Scriptures; but let the time paſt, wherein thou haſt walked in the vanity of
thy mind, contrary unto truth and ſound doctrine, ſuffice; and peradventure the
Lord will wink at thy ignorance, and accept of thy repentance; for the Scriptures
were not given forth to make a gain of, but to be believed and fulfilled in their
ſeaſon, and they are profitable for inſtruction, for correction, for reproof, that ſo
the man of God may bee made perfect: which doctrine of perfection you all deny,
and ſo are not found in the doctrine of Chriſt and his Apoſtles, but out of it, and
are ſtrangers and enemies to it.</p>
            <p>The third Scripture thou bringeſt, is <hi>Luke</hi> 10. 7. where our Lord Jeſus Chriſt in
his Commiſſion to his Diſciples, commands them to remain in whatſoever houſe
they ſhould enter, <hi>eating and drinking ſuch things as they give; for ſaith he, The laborer
is worthy of his hire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall now examine whether you and your fraternity be ſuch as Chriſt ſent forth
to labour in his Vinyard, or whether you be not ſuch as beat his ſervants, (which
from time to time he ſent forth, and when the Son came, killed him alſo, that ſo the
Inheritance might be theirs.) Firſt then, Are you <hi>Lambs,</hi> as the true Miniſters of
Chriſt were, <hi>verſe the third of the ſame Chapter,</hi> (&amp; as the true Miniſters of Chriſt are
at this day amongſt wolves?) Or are you not the Wolves your ſelves, ſucking the
blood, and tearing the fleſh of the Lambs, and they do not reſiſt you? Secondly,
Are you ſuch as go forth without money in your purſes, and without ſcrip and
ſhoes, ſaluting no man by the way, as Chriſts Diſciples did? <hi>verſe</hi> 4. Or do you not
inſtead thereof, go forth well accommodated and provided with all theſe things,
and rather then you will ſtir, be aſſured of one hundred pounds by the yeer, and
ſeldom leſs, but often times more? And in your going forth, do you ſalute no man
by the way? Or do you not rather complement with all you know, and court every
man in power (who will be lead by you) for Augmentations, Plurarities, or grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
livings and preferments then you either want or deſerve? Thirdly, Do you ſay,
Peace be to the Houſe whereinto you enter, as the true Miniſters of Chriſt did, and
ſtill do? Or do you not inſteed thereof, either ſit down in your own great Parſonage-Houſes,
and there Lord it more like Kings in their Palaces, then like deſpiſed Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
of the Goſpel? Or if you enter into other mens Houſes, whether inſtead of
ſaying, <hi>Peace be unto it,</hi> you do not proclaim war, and with Swords, Staves, Bailiffs,
or Conſtables, force your ſelves in, and take by violence, their goods from them,
to ſatisfie your bellies, and your unſatiable luſts of the tenths of mens labours and
eſtates that owe you nothing, nor receive no ſpiritual things from you. Fourthly,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:106951:3"/>
Are you ſuch as eat and drink ſuch things as are ſet before you, as the true Miniſters
of Chriſt did, and ſtill do? Or do you not devour Widows Houſes, and for a
pretence make long prayers? Fifthly: Are you ſuch as are content with your hire?
and do you receive it from thoſe onely that ſet you to labour? Or do you not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
pay from thoſe that know you to be Loyterers, and never ſet you to work?
Friends and people, examine the caſe whether it be not ſo; if ſo, they have no title
to a Goſpel-Maintenance, no more then they can evidence themſelves to be Chriſts
Miniſters, and which maintenance is no more by Tythes, then they can prove them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to be Goſpel-Preachers, which by their Doctrine and Practice appears they
are not.</p>
            <p>The fourth Scripture thou bringeſt to prove Tythes a Goſpel-Maintenance, is the
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 7. 11. Where the Apoſtle ſaith thus, <hi>Who goeth a warfare any time at his own
charge? who planteth a Vinyard, and eateth not of the fruit thereof? Or who feedeth a
flock, and eateth not of the Milk of the flock?</hi> This is thy proof for Tythes: To which
I ſay, thou haſt more need to be pittied, then refuted, as being wholly ignorant of
the ſcope of the Apoſtle in that place; he is ſo far from exacting a forced mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
eſpecially upon the accompt of his Miniſtry, that he thus reaſoneth with the
<hi>Corinthians, Though</hi> [ſaith he] <hi>I be not an Apoſtle to others, yet doubtleſs I am to you,
for the ſeal of mine Apoſtleship</hi> [ſaith he] <hi>are ye in the Lord,</hi> verſe the ſecond of the
ſame Chapter; and from thence argueth as before in the ſeventh verſe. Now ſay I,
If you would follow the example of the Apoſtle, and do as he did, to wit, Sow ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
things indeed and in truth, and not preach your own imaginations for Chriſt's
Goſpel, then ſhould they to whom you ſow ſpiritual things, adminiſter unto you
their temporal things, and that as freely too, as you ſhould adminiſter your ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
things; but if you ſhall reap where you ſow not, as now moſt of you all do,
then muſt we needs deny you to abide in the Apoſtles Doctrine, and ſay you are
none of Chriſts miniſters, and deſerve none of his maintenance, but are Vſurpers,
Hirelings, and no Goſpel-miniſters, and deſerve puniſhment rather then pay.</p>
            <p>The fifth Scripture quoted by thee to prove tythes a Goſpel-maintenance, is in
the ſame Chapter, the 9, 10, 11, 12, &amp; 13. verſes, Which becauſe I will not repeat,
they being all concerning the ſame Argument before ſpoken of, I ſhall refer the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſal
of them to the impartial Reader, and he will clearly ſee thoſe texts are ſo far
from proving tythes a Goſpel-maintenance for Goſpel-miniſters, that the Apoſtle is
direct againſt a ſetled maintenance; firſt, by his Argument in the <hi>9th.</hi> verſe, where
it is ſaid, <hi>Thou shalt not muzzle the mouth of the Ox that treadeth out the Corn;</hi> by which
it appears the Ox muſt tread out the Corn, whoſe mouth is not to be muzled. Are
you ſuch as tread out the Corn? If ſo, then we ſhall not allow that your mouths
ſhould be muzled, but have food and rayment convenient for you, as the true Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
of Chriſt have; and were you ſuch, you would therewith be contented; and of
this you need not (nay you would not) doubt; for I never yet ſaw the righteous
forſaken, nor his ſeed beg their bread, as you and your ſeed have done, the more
are you to be pittied. The other Argument is from the Apoſtles words in the 11. and
12. verſes, where he ſaith, <hi>If we have ſown unto you ſpiritual things, is it a great matter
if we shall reap your carnal things? yet nevertheleſs</hi> ſaith he <hi>we have not aſed this pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
but ſuffer all things, leaſt we should hinder the Goſpel of Chriſt.</hi> So far was the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle
from owning a ſetled maintenance, that you ſee he denied the lawful uſe of his
Chriſtian liberty; nay, let me ſay further, A ſetled maintenance is moſt unreaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and unjuſt for Goſpel Miniſters, becauſe they are to be obedient alwayes to
Chriſts Commands, and Chriſts Work is not alwayes in one place, and therefore
can have no ſetled maintenance: I ſay, his Miniſters are to go where <gap reason="illegible: poor copy" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:106951:4"/>
and to be paid where they do their work, ſometimes in one City, and ſometimes
in another, and where they ſow, there are they to reap, and not to reap where they
ſow not; ſo that we deny you and your ſetled maintenance to be of Chriſt, but
both are out from Chriſts way, and therefore cannot pay you the one, nor allow
you the other.</p>
            <p>The ſixth and ſeventh Scriptures quoted by thee, is in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2. 8. &amp; <hi>Iſa.</hi> 49. 23.
Where in the firſt, the Prophet <hi>David</hi> ſpeaking, as I may ſay, in the perſon of Chriſt,
(the Lord having in the ſeventh verſe ſaid, <hi>Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten
thee;</hi> goes on and) ſaith, <hi>Ask of me, and I will give thee the Heathen for thine Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
and the uttermoſt parts of the earth for thy poſſeſsion:</hi> And as to that place in <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaiah,</hi>
where the Prophet ſaith, <hi>Kings shall be thy Nurſing-fathers, and their Queens
thy Nurſing-mothers, and they shall bow down to thee with their face towards the earth,
and lick up the duſt of thy feet, and thou shalt know shat I am the Lord, for they shall not
be ashamed that wait for me.</hi> I ſay, that neither of theſe two texts is to the matter of
tythes, or maintenance intended by thee; for the one ſpeaks of Chriſt his being
the begotten Son of the Father, and of the greatneſs of the Sons Dominion, and
of his power over the Heathens rage, and over the counſels which the Rulers take
againſt him, and is alſo a propheſie of their deſtruction, for ſaith he, <hi>Thou shalt break
them with a Rod of Iron, and dash them in pieces like a Potters Veſſel.</hi> And the other
text is concerning the Lords owning of the Gentiles, and ſetting up a Standard to
the people; and becauſe the Lord will own them, and bring them in to be his people,
which were not his people, therefore it is that Kings ſhall be their nurſing-fathers,
and Queens their nurſing-mothers, <hi>&amp;c. and they shall not be ashamed that wait for
him.</hi> Friend, hadſt thou a diſcerning in the things of God, thou wouldſt have ſeen
alſo, that part of this propheſie is to be fulfilled upon the oppreſſors of the children
of God, even upon the Hirelings, and thoſe that prey upon the Captives of the
Lord, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 25. of the ſame Chapter; and the Lord ſaith, <hi>He will contend with them
that contend with his people, and will ſave his children; and they that oppreſs them shall eat
their own flesh, and they shall be drunken with their own blood, and all flesh shall knew that
God is the Saviour and Redeemer of his people, even the holy one of Iacob: Ver.</hi> 26. And
now let the wiſe in heart judge whether theſe Scriptures hitherto quoted by thee,
ſpeak any thing as to the maintenance of Miniſters by tythes, or not.</p>
            <p>The eighth and ninth places to prove the publike maintenance by way of tythes,
to be a fit maintenance for publike diſpenſers of the Goſpel, are theſe, <hi>Gen.</hi> 14. 20.
<hi>Heb</hi> 7. 4, 5. and 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 14. To the two firſt which ſpeak of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s paying the
tenth of the ſpoils to <hi>Melchiſedeck,</hi> and alſo of <hi>Levi</hi>'s receiving of tythes, is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
at all to the maintenance of Goſpel-Diſpenſers, for which end thou quoteſt
them: And without controverſie that Prieſthood is changed, for it made nothing
perfect; and another prieſthood is ariſen, who is made not after the Law of a
carnal commandment, but after the power of an endleſs life, who hath put an end
to the firſt prieſthood, and conſequently to tythes alſo, and to the Doctrine of all
ſuch Hirelings as will not preach without gifts and rewards. The other text being
the 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9 14. which ſaith, <hi>they that preach the Goſpel, should live of tbe Goſpel,</hi> hath
been largely ſpoken to already; and therefore I ſhall conclude, and tell thee, that
thou haſt proved nothing by Scripture, that tythes is a Goſpel-maintenance, or
that the diſpenſers thereof are to be afforded tythes by way of maintenance for
preaching the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>It now remains to make it appear as well to thee, as to all men elſe, that you
(who call your ſelves Miniſters of the Chnrch of <hi>England</hi>) are neither Miniſters
<gap reason="illegible: poor copy" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap>, nor of the Spirit; and if ſo, I ſhall leave wiſe men to judge whether
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:106951:4"/>
you deſerve to be maintained and upheld as Miniſters of the Goſpel, yea or no.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt</hi> then, I ſay, you are not true Miniſters of the Letter, inaſmuch as you preach
contrary thereunto, &amp; that I ſhall inſtance in theſe particulars following; As <hi>firſt,</hi>
you ſay, that the holy Law of God cannot be kept by the beſt of Saints while they
live upon earth. Which doctrine is contrary to the doctrine of the Scriptures, and
to the experiences of the Saints recorded therein: for <hi>David</hi> ſaid that he had kept
them; <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 166, 167, 198, <hi>verſes.</hi> And St. <hi>John</hi> ſaith, <hi>That hereby shall the
Saints know that they know him; to wit, if they keep his commandements,</hi> 1 Joh 2. 3. inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mating,
that he that doth not keep the commandements of God, doth not know
him: and again, <hi>He that ſaith he knoweth God, and keepeth not his commandements,
is a liar, and the truth is not in him,</hi> verſ. 4. What Miniſters are you then; that not
onely preach contrary to the Letter of the Scripture, but alſo contrary to the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
of the Saints? <hi>Secondly</hi> you ſay there is no perfection to be attained here, and
ſo preach a doctrine contrary to the Letter of the Scriptures, for Chriſt commanded
his Diſciples <hi>to be perfect, as their heavenly Father is perfect:</hi> and the Apoſtles doctrine
was for the <hi>perfecting of the Saints;</hi> and he ſaid <hi>he ſpake wiſdome amongſt them that were
perfect:</hi> this being ſo, I ſhall leave all ſober men to judge, whether you be true
Miniſters of the Letter? and yet are ſo bold as to ſay, <hi>you make the Scriptures your
rule.</hi> I could clearly inſtance in many more particulars, that you are no true Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
of the Letter of the Scriptures, but theſe are ſufficient.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly</hi> I affirm, That you are not Miniſters of the Spirit neither, of which the
Apoſtles were able Miniſters, for you (contrary to the Scriptures, and to the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt) ſay, <hi>That Revelation is ceaſed:</hi> whenas our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
himſelf expreſsly ſaith, <hi>No man knoweth the Son but the Father, neither knoweth
any man the Father ſave the Son, and he to whom ſoever the Son will reveal him,</hi> Mat.
11. 27. So then its evident enough, that all you who deny Revelation, know neither
the Father, nor the Son: whom to know is life eternal, and without the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg
of whom you cannot know the mind of the Spirit: for the Spirit of the Lord
revealeth not the thing of its ſelf to any, but to thoſe that receive the teaching of
the Father and the Son; and no man can know the Father and the Son, but by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation.
So that it appears to all men of a good underſtanding, that you are nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Miniſters of the Spirit, nor of the Letter.</p>
            <p>Now ſince it is thus evident, that you are no Miniſters of the Spirit, as the true
Miniſters were, nor yet true Miniſters of the Letter; Whoſe Miniſters may ſome ſay,
are they? I anſwer: You are Miniſters of Antichriſt, and found to be in the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> whoſe belly is your god, whoſe glory is your ſhame,
who mind earthly things: you are fruitleſs trees cumbring the ground, and whoſe
end is to be burnt and conſumed by the breath of his mouth, and by the brightneſs of
his coming; and this will be your reward and portion without ſpeedy Repentance,
and turning from your wickedneſs, whereby you craftily deceive the ſimple, and
miſlead the innocent whom the Lord will teach, for he hath ſaid, <hi>His people shall bee
all taught of him.</hi>
            </p>

FRiend, my purpoſe is not to plead againſt a Goſpel-maintenance for Goſpel-Miniſters;
no, God forbid, for I own both; but to cry out againſt Tythes, and a forced maintenance,
as all men of ſobriety and moderation do, and muſt do if they approve themſelves true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians:
I ſay, the true Worshippers cannot maintain a falſe Miniſtry, nor uphold the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of Idols, as well knowing they muſt fall, together with all the Ceremonies and falſe Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
practiſed and preached in them, and by them: Nor had I been found to diſcover thy
nakedneſs to the world, hadſt thou not ſo viſibly appeared to be cloathed with a shadow, and
to be found diſowning the Wedding-garment.</p>
            <p>And now let me ask thee, and thoſe of your generation and profeſsion, On whoſe heads,
do you think, all the guilt of that blood that hath been shed in <hi>England</hi> for Tithes within
theſe ſeven years past, beſides the loſs of goods and lives of many of the dear ſervants of the
Lord will light, if not on you who plead for, and will have Tithes, and force a maintenance
from the ſervants of God, contrary to their conſciences? Do you think to shuffle it off from
yourſelves, and lay it upon the Civil Magiſtrates? O no! you cannot (though they are
not guiltleſs herein) the Lord will not be mocked; for you are the men who have robbed
the Lord of his honor, and his people of their goods, liberties, and lives, to put into your bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies,
and to uphold carnal Ordinances, which perish with the uſings and to keep alive your
dead Meetings, dead Prayers, dead Preachings, dead Doctrines, dead Faſts, dead Exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
and dead Miniſtry.</p>
            <div type="conclusion">
               <p>Friends, let me tell you, your foundation it in death, and therefore your dead Structure
will fall to the duſt, and the houſe you have built, fall upon your own heads, all the powers
of the earth being too weake to uphold it. And that in thy Paper which is not anſwered
herein, is left to another hand to anſwer, partly becauſe I wanted room in this Sheet, not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to beſtow Sheets upon thee concerning this matter.</p>
               <p>Now that I may not leave you without a word of Counſel, I do in love to all your ſouls
admonish yon to come out of Babylon, your Land of Confuſion, and where your Language
is confounded, and come unto the true fear of the Lord, which is the beginning of wiſdom, and
the way to a good underſtanding in the things of God, and ſo in time as you be faithful,
may you become Goſpel-Miniſters, and receive Goſpel-Maintenance.</p>
