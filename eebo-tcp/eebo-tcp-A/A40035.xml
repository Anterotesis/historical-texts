            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

that Tithes are the undoubted maintenance for ≈øuch Mini≈øters, before ever they
≈øhould have proceeded to the impri≈øonment of mens bodies, and forcing from them
their e≈øtates, for not paying of them; and if you cannot all manife≈øt your ≈øelves by
the≈øe things, then give me leave to tll you all, you are deceivers, and not Go≈øpel-preachers,
and the Lord will require the blood of the innocent at your hands. But
I ≈øhal come to the que≈øtion propounded by thee, and examine thy proofs for tythes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Que≈øtion,</hi> Whether it be convenient, that the pre≈øent way of the maintenance of Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øters

as thou ≈øai≈øt, in the providence of God for the publick di≈øpen≈øers of the Go≈øpel, upon
pretences of pre≈øent inconvenience, or promi≈øes of future provi≈øion, is a contempt of the care
and faithfulne≈øs of God towards his Church, aud is in plain terms down-right robbery.
<hi>And further thou ≈øai≈øt, that to entitle a Nation unto ≈øuch an action, by impo≈øing it
on them without their con≈øent, is down-right oppre≈ø≈øion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. I ≈øhall fir≈øt ≈øpeak to the Que≈øtion propounded, and in an≈øwer thereunto, do
po≈øitively affirm, and ≈øay contrarily, That the pre≈øent way of maintenance for Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni≈øters
by Tithes, is not onely a great oppre≈ø≈øion, and intollerable in a Chri≈øtian
Common-wealth, or among≈øt men profe≈ø≈øing Chri≈øt Je≈øus to be their King, Prie≈øt,
and Prophet, but al≈øo Antichri≈øtian, and contrary to the maintenance and practice
of Go≈øpel-mini≈øters: And that not to remove ≈øuch an oppre≈ø≈øion, were little le≈øs,
in plain Engli≈øh, then direct robbery, or to uphold wickedne≈øs by a Law, God ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
appointed no ≈øuch maintenance for Go≈øpel-preachers, but is a maintenance, as
you may read, ≈øet up by Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> the tenth, in the year 1211. and not by Chri≈øt,
nor was it ever practi≈øed by the Apo≈øtles or Di≈øciples of Chri≈øt in the primitive
times: And <hi>Cook</hi> in the <hi>third part of his In≈øtitutes</hi> al≈øo te≈øtifies, that Tenths and
Fir≈øt-fruits are but a late Innovation, aud claimed by the Pope as Succe≈ø≈øor to the
Jewi≈øh High-prie≈øt: and Doctor <hi>Seamor,</hi> one of your own Divines confe≈ø≈øed before
the Committee of Parliament, in the year 1653. that their Call to the mini≈øtry

            <p>Now that Tithes is an oppre≈ø≈øion and an unrighteous thing, examine the ≈øuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings

But becau≈øe I de≈øire that the truth may prevail, and that it may be made manife≈øt
to all that have but a ≈øeeing eye, or a hearing ear; I ≈øhall examine the ≈øtrength of thy
proofs by tho≈øe very Scriptures which thou ha≈øt quoted to prove Tithes a fit main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
for the publick di≈øpen≈øers of the Go≈øpell.</p>
            <p>Thy fir≈øt proof is 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 4. in which place the Apo≈øtle ≈øaith, <hi>They that preach the
Go≈øpel should live of the Go≈øpel.</hi> Now I appeal to all indifferent men, that do not
≈øuffer the thick vail of fal≈øe Doctrine to remain as ≈øcales upon their eies, whether this
text pleads for a maintenance by Tithes, or no: If thou had≈øt known what it is to
live of the Go≈øpel, thou would≈øt have cried out again≈øt the oppre≈øiing of tender con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øciences
to maintain thee, and not have cried out to the civil power, for fear that the
oppre≈ø≈øion ≈øhould be removed. FRIEND! Is forcing from people the tenth part
of their hard labour and e≈øtates, to maintain your generation in pride, idlene≈øs, and
fulne≈øs of bread, a living of the Go≈øpel? If this be to live of the Co≈øpel, 'tis a life
the Apo≈øtles and true Mini≈øters of Chri≈øt never lived, nor their Lord and Ma≈øter never
commanded; who when he ≈øent forth his Di≈øciples to preach, charged them not to
take any thing for their journey, nor two coats, no ≈øcrip, no bread, nor any mony in
their pur≈øes, <hi>Mark</hi> 6. 8, 9. But now you are ≈øo far from ob≈øerving Chri≈øts doctrine,
and his commands, that your generation walk quite contrary: for in≈øtead of going
forth without provi≈øion, you will not go forth unle≈øs it be well a≈ø≈øured unto you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-hand.
The true laborers in Chri≈øts Vineyard, I ≈øay, never contracted for a ≈øet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled
maintenance, nor divined for money, as you do; but as they had freely receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
≈øo they freely gave, and when they had done Chri≈øts work, received Chri≈øts
wages, but not compelled peoples e≈øtates from them, nor for being unwilling to part
with it, ca≈øt their bodies into pri≈øon, as many of you have done. Now Friend, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe
thou art ignorant of Chri≈øts doctrine, and of the Go≈øpel-mini≈øters mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
as al≈øo of the Apo≈øtles words before by thee quoted, I ≈øhall let thee know,
that to live of the Go≈øpel, is to receive what is freely admini≈øtred unto thee: <hi>Or
thus:</hi> The true Mini≈øters of the Go≈øpel fir≈øt plant a Vineyard, and then partake of
the fruit thereof: <hi>Or thus,</hi> They receive temporal hings of tho≈øe to whom they ≈øow
≈øpiritual things, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 11. Yet (le≈øt any ≈øhould be mi≈øtaken, as though the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtle
would be ≈øo mainteined) the Apo≈øtle ≈øaith, I have u≈øed none of the≈øe things,
neither have I written the≈øe things, that it ≈øhould be ≈øo done unto me, <hi>ver≈ø.</hi> 15. By
which thou fee≈øt plainly, that the Apo≈øtle and true Mini≈øter of the Go≈øpel, was no
mercenary Preacher nor hireling, but freely as he had received, ≈øo he freely gave:
he was ≈øo far from compelling any to maintain him for preaching, as your fraterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
do, that he denied his Chri≈øtian liberty, and wrought with his hands: I ≈øay,
<hi>Paul</hi> ≈øought for no reward from men for preaching the Go≈øpel, as you all do, but
≈øaith he, If I do this thing willingly, I have my reward; and what is my reward,
≈øaith he, verily this, <hi>That when I preach the Go≈øpel, I may make the Go≈øpel of Chri≈øt
without charge, that I abu≈øe not my power in the Go≈øpel,</hi> ver. 18.</p>
            <p>Now let all the world of unbelievers ≈øee, how contrary the practice of the
Mini≈øters of the Church of <hi>England</hi> is from the true Mini≈øters of Chri≈øt, and how
chargeable your Go≈øpel is, even ≈øo dear hath it been made to ≈øome, that it hath
co≈øt them their lives in na≈øty pri≈øons, when as the true Mini≈øters Go≈øpel is without
charge, and is freely preached to all that will receive it. And ≈øaith the true Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,
<hi>Hoe, every one that thir≈øteth, come to the waters, and buy wine and milk without mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
and without price:</hi> This is the voice of the true Prophets of the Lord, but the
fal≈øe Prophets they look for their gain from their quarters: <hi>And even as Troops of
Robbers wait for a man, ≈øo do they murther in the way by con≈øent,</hi> Ho≈øea 6. 9.</p>
            <p>Thy next proof for Tithes is this, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 6. the words of the Apo≈øtle are the≈øe;
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:106951:3"/>
               <hi>Let him that is taught in the Word, communicate unto him that teacheth, in all good
things.</hi> Truly, Friend, wer't not thou wilfully blind, or willingly ignorant, thou
would≈øt not prodnce this text to prove Tithes a lawful maintenance for Go≈øpel-mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni≈øters,
but would≈øt ingeniou≈øly confe≈øs, and in ≈øinglene≈øs of heart ≈øay, This is from
the text, and Tithes are Antichri≈øtian. There needs no other confutation of
thee herein, then the aming of the words them≈øelves, which I recommend to thy
review, and all mens el≈øe who can but read Engli≈øh. <hi>Friend,</hi> be not deceived, nor do
thou any longer endeavour to deceive others: for though thou mai≈øt do ≈øo, yet
the Lord will not be mocked, nor the true Chri≈øtians deluded by ≈øuch lines of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fu≈øion
and palpable darkne≈øs, as thou would≈øt draw over the minds and the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtandings
of the civil powers of the earth, who have drunk down error for truth,
even as the fi≈øhes drink water: and this they and other ≈øilly people do, under the
≈øpecious pretences of your being Mini≈øters of the Go≈øpel, when as in truth the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øpel
of Chri≈øt you are ≈øtrangers unto, and ≈øo are ignorant of its maintenance.
Bee advi≈øed by a lover of the truth, to learn wi≈ødom, and no longer to make a trade
of the Scriptures; but let the time pa≈øt, wherein thou ha≈øt walked in the vanity of
thy mind, contrary unto truth and ≈øound doctrine, ≈øuffice; and peradventure the
Lord will wink at thy ignorance, and accept of thy repentance; for the Scriptures
were not given forth to make a gain of, but to be believed and fulfilled in their
≈øea≈øon, and they are profitable for in≈øtruction, for correction, for reproof, that ≈øo
the man of God may bee made perfect: which doctrine of perfection you all deny,
and ≈øo are not found in the doctrine of Chri≈øt and his Apo≈øtles, but out of it, and
are ≈øtrangers and enemies to it.</p>
            <p>The third Scripture thou bringe≈øt, is <hi>Luke</hi> 10. 7. where our Lord Je≈øus Chri≈øt in
his Commi≈ø≈øion to his Di≈øciples, commands them to remain in what≈øoever hou≈øe
they ≈øhould enter, <hi>eating and drinking ≈øuch things as they give; for ≈øaith he, The laborer
is worthy of his hire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ≈øhall now examine whether you and your fraternity be ≈øuch as Chri≈øt ≈øent forth
to labour in his Vinyard, or whether you be not ≈øuch as beat his ≈øervants, (which
from time to time he ≈øent forth, and when the Son came, killed him al≈øo, that ≈øo the
Inheritance might be theirs.) Fir≈øt then, Are you <hi>Lambs,</hi> as the true Mini≈øters of
Chri≈øt were, <hi>ver≈øe the third of the ≈øame Chapter,</hi> (&amp; as the true Mini≈øters of Chri≈øt are
at this day among≈øt wolves?) Or are you not the Wolves your ≈øelves, ≈øucking the
blood, and tearing the fle≈øh of the Lambs, and they do not re≈øi≈øt you? Secondly,
Are you ≈øuch as go forth without money in your pur≈øes, and without ≈øcrip and
≈øhoes, ≈øaluting no man by the way, as Chri≈øts Di≈øciples did? <hi>ver≈øe</hi> 4. Or do you not
in≈øtead thereof, go forth well accommodated and provided with all the≈øe things,
and rather then you will ≈øtir, be a≈ø≈øured of one hundred pounds by the yeer, and
≈øeldom le≈øs, but often times more? And in your going forth, do you ≈øalute no man
by the way? Or do you not rather complement with all you know, and court every
man in power (who will be lead by you) for Augmentations, Plurarities, or grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
livings and preferments then you either want or de≈øerve? Thirdly, Do you ≈øay,
Peace be to the Hou≈øe whereinto you enter, as the true Mini≈øters of Chri≈øt did, and
≈øtill do? Or do you not in≈øteed thereof, either ≈øit down in your own great Par≈øonage-Hou≈øes,
and there Lord it more like Kings in their Palaces, then like de≈øpi≈øed Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øters
of the Go≈øpel? Or if you enter into other mens Hou≈øes, whether in≈øtead of
≈øaying, <hi>Peace be unto it,</hi> you do not proclaim war, and with Swords, Staves, Bailiffs,
or Con≈øtables, force your ≈øelves in, and take by violence, their goods from them,
to ≈øatisfie your bellies, and your un≈øatiable lu≈øts of the tenths of mens labours and
e≈øtates that owe you nothing, nor receive no ≈øpiritual things from you. Fourthly,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:106951:3"/>
Are you ≈øuch as eat and drink ≈øuch things as are ≈øet before you, as the true Mini≈øters
of Chri≈øt did, and ≈øtill do? Or do you not devour Widows Hou≈øes, and for a
pretence make long prayers? Fifthly: Are you ≈øuch as are content with your hire?
and do you receive it from tho≈øe onely that ≈øet you to labour? Or do you not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
pay from tho≈øe that know you to be Loyterers, and never ≈øet you to work?
Friends and people, examine the ca≈øe whether it be not ≈øo; if ≈øo, they have no title
to a Go≈øpel-Maintenance, no more then they can evidence them≈øelves to be Chri≈øts
Mini≈øters, and which maintenance is no more by Tythes, then they can prove them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves
to be Go≈øpel-Preachers, which by their Doctrine and Practice appears they
are not.</p>
            <p>The fourth Scripture thou bringe≈øt to prove Tythes a Go≈øpel-Maintenance, is the
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 7. 11. Where the Apo≈øtle ≈øaith thus, <hi>Who goeth a warfare any time at his own
charge? who planteth a Vinyard, and eateth not of the fruit thereof? Or who feedeth a
flock, and eateth not of the Milk of the flock?</hi> This is thy proof for Tythes: To which
I ≈øay, thou ha≈øt more need to be pittied, then refuted, as being wholly ignorant of
the ≈øcope of the Apo≈øtle in that place; he is ≈øo far from exacting a forced mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
e≈øpecially upon the accompt of his Mini≈øtry, that he thus rea≈øoneth with the
<hi>Corinthians, Though</hi> [≈øaith he] <hi>I be not an Apo≈øtle to others, yet doubtle≈øs I am to you,
for the ≈øeal of mine Apo≈øtleship</hi> [≈øaith he] <hi>are ye in the Lord,</hi> ver≈øe the ≈øecond of the
≈øame Chapter; and from thence argueth as before in the ≈øeventh ver≈øe. Now ≈øay I,
If you would follow the example of the Apo≈øtle, and do as he did, to wit, Sow ≈øpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
things indeed and in truth, and not preach your own imaginations for Chri≈øt's
Go≈øpel, then ≈øhould they to whom you ≈øow ≈øpiritual things, admini≈øter unto you
their temporal things, and that as freely too, as you ≈øhould admini≈øter your ≈øpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
things; but if you ≈øhall reap where you ≈øow not, as now mo≈øt of you all do,
then mu≈øt we needs deny you to abide in the Apo≈øtles Doctrine, and ≈øay you are
none of Chri≈øts mini≈øters, and de≈øerve none of his maintenance, but are V≈øurpers,
Hirelings, and no Go≈øpel-mini≈øters, and de≈øerve puni≈øhment rather then pay.</p>
            <p>The fifth Scripture quoted by thee to prove tythes a Go≈øpel-maintenance, is in
the ≈øame Chapter, the 9, 10, 11, 12, &amp; 13. ver≈øes, Which becau≈øe I will not repeat,
they being all concerning the ≈øame Argument before ≈øpoken of, I ≈øhall refer the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>u≈øal
of them to the impartial Reader, and he will clearly ≈øee tho≈øe texts are ≈øo far
from proving tythes a Go≈øpel-maintenance for Go≈øpel-mini≈øters, that the Apo≈øtle is
direct again≈øt a ≈øetled maintenance; fir≈øt, by his Argument in the <hi>9th.</hi> ver≈øe, where
it is ≈øaid, <hi>Thou shalt not muzzle the mouth of the Ox that treadeth out the Corn;</hi> by which
it appears the Ox mu≈øt tread out the Corn, who≈øe mouth is not to be muzled. Are
you ≈øuch as tread out the Corn? If ≈øo, then we ≈øhall not allow that your mouths
≈øhould be muzled, but have food and rayment convenient for you, as the true Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øters
of Chri≈øt have; and were you ≈øuch, you would therewith be contented; and of
this you need not (nay you would not) doubt; for I never yet ≈øaw the righteous
for≈øaken, nor his ≈øeed beg their bread, as you and your ≈øeed have done, the more
are you to be pittied. The other Argument is from the Apo≈øtles words in the 11. and
12. ver≈øes, where he ≈øaith, <hi>If we have ≈øown unto you ≈øpiritual things, is it a great matter
if we shall reap your carnal things? yet neverthele≈øs</hi> ≈øaith he <hi>we have not a≈øed this pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
but ≈øuffer all things, lea≈øt we should hinder the Go≈øpel of Chri≈øt.</hi> So far was the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øtle
from owning a ≈øetled maintenance, that you ≈øee he denied the lawful u≈øe of his
Chri≈øtian liberty; nay, let me ≈øay further, A ≈øetled maintenance is mo≈øt unrea≈øona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and unju≈øt for Go≈øpel Mini≈øters, becau≈øe they are to be obedient alwayes to
Chri≈øts Commands, and Chri≈øts Work is not alwayes in one place, and therefore
can have no ≈øetled maintenance: I ≈øay, his Mini≈øters are to go where <gap reason="illegible: poor copy" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>„Äà‚Ä¶„Äâ</desc>
               </gap>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:106951:4"/>
and to be paid where they do their work, ≈øometimes in one City, and ≈øometimes
in another, and where they ≈øow, there are they to reap, and not to reap where they
≈øow not; ≈øo that we deny you and your ≈øetled maintenance to be of Chri≈øt, but
both are out from Chri≈øts way, and therefore cannot pay you the one, nor allow
you the other.</p>
            <p>The ≈øixth and ≈øeventh Scriptures quoted by thee, is in <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 2. 8. &amp; <hi>I≈øa.</hi> 49. 23.
Where in the fir≈øt, the Prophet <hi>David</hi> ≈øpeaking, as I may ≈øay, in the per≈øon of Chri≈øt,
(the Lord having in the ≈øeventh ver≈øe ≈øaid, <hi>Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten
thee;</hi> goes on and) ≈øaith, <hi>Ask of me, and I will give thee the Heathen for thine Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
and the uttermo≈øt parts of the earth for thy po≈ø≈øe≈øsion:</hi> And as to that place in <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øaiah,</hi>
where the Prophet ≈øaith, <hi>Kings shall be thy Nur≈øing-fathers, and their Queens
thy Nur≈øing-mothers, and they shall bow down to thee with their face towards the earth,
and lick up the du≈øt of thy feet, and thou shalt know shat I am the Lord, for they shall not
be ashamed that wait for me.</hi> I ≈øay, that neither of the≈øe two texts is to the matter of
tythes, or maintenance intended by thee; for the one ≈øpeaks of Chri≈øt his being
the begotten Son of the Father, and of the greatne≈øs of the Sons Dominion, and
of his power over the Heathens rage, and over the coun≈øels which the Rulers take
again≈øt him, and is al≈øo a prophe≈øie of their de≈øtruction, for ≈øaith he, <hi>Thou shalt break
them with a Rod of Iron, and dash them in pieces like a Potters Ve≈ø≈øel.</hi> And the other
text is concerning the Lords owning of the Gentiles, and ≈øetting up a Standard to
the people; and becau≈øe the Lord will own them, and bring them in to be his people,
which were not his people, therefore it is that Kings ≈øhall be their nur≈øing-fathers,
and Queens their nur≈øing-mothers, <hi>&amp;c. and they shall not be ashamed that wait for
him.</hi> Friend, had≈øt thou a di≈øcerning in the things of God, thou would≈øt have ≈øeen
al≈øo, that part of this prophe≈øie is to be fulfilled upon the oppre≈ø≈øors of the children
of God, even upon the Hirelings, and tho≈øe that prey upon the Captives of the
Lord, <hi>Ver≈ø.</hi> 25. of the ≈øame Chapter; and the Lord ≈øaith, <hi>He will contend with them
that contend with his people, and will ≈øave his children; and they that oppre≈øs them shall eat
their own flesh, and they shall be drunken with their own blood, and all flesh shall knew that
God is the Saviour and Redeemer of his people, even the holy one of Iacob: Ver.</hi> 26. And
now let the wi≈øe in heart judge whether the≈øe Scriptures hitherto quoted by thee,
≈øpeak any thing as to the maintenance of Mini≈øters by tythes, or not.</p>
            <p>The eighth and ninth places to prove the publike maintenance by way of tythes,
to be a fit maintenance for publike di≈øpen≈øers of the Go≈øpel, are the≈øe, <hi>Gen.</hi> 14. 20.
<hi>Heb</hi> 7. 4, 5. and 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 14. To the two fir≈øt which ≈øpeak of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s paying the
tenth of the ≈øpoils to <hi>Melchi≈øedeck,</hi> and al≈øo of <hi>Levi</hi>'s receiving of tythes, is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
at all to the maintenance of Go≈øpel-Di≈øpen≈øers, for which end thou quote≈øt
them: And without controver≈øie that Prie≈øthood is changed, for it made nothing
perfect; and another prie≈øthood is ari≈øen, who is made not after the Law of a
carnal commandment, but after the power of an endle≈øs life, who hath put an end
to the fir≈øt prie≈øthood, and con≈øequently to tythes al≈øo, and to the Doctrine of all
≈øuch Hirelings as will not preach without gifts and rewards. The other text being
the 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9 14. which ≈øaith, <hi>they that preach the Go≈øpel, should live of tbe Go≈øpel,</hi> hath
been largely ≈øpoken to already; and therefore I ≈øhall conclude, and tell thee, that
thou ha≈øt proved nothing by Scripture, that tythes is a Go≈øpel-maintenance, or
that the di≈øpen≈øers thereof are to be afforded tythes by way of maintenance for
preaching the Go≈øpel.</p>
            <p>It now remains to make it appear as well to thee, as to all men el≈øe, that you
(who call your ≈øelves Mini≈øters of the Chnrch of <hi>England</hi>) are neither Mini≈øters
<gap reason="illegible: poor copy" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>„Äà‚Ä¶„Äâ</desc>
               </gap>, nor of the Spirit; and if ≈øo, I ≈øhall leave wi≈øe men to judge whether
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:106951:4"/>
you de≈øerve to be maintained and upheld as Mini≈øters of the Go≈øpel, yea or no.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fir≈øt</hi> then, I ≈øay, you are not true Mini≈øters of the Letter, ina≈ømuch as you preach
contrary thereunto, &amp; that I ≈øhall in≈øtance in the≈øe particulars following; As <hi>fir≈øt,</hi>
you ≈øay, that the holy Law of God cannot be kept by the be≈øt of Saints while they
live upon earth. Which doctrine is contrary to the doctrine of the Scriptures, and
to the experiences of the Saints recorded therein: for <hi>David</hi> ≈øaid that he had kept
them; <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 119. 166, 167, 198, <hi>ver≈øes.</hi> And St. <hi>John</hi> ≈øaith, <hi>That hereby shall the
Saints know that they know him; to wit, if they keep his commandements,</hi> 1 Joh 2. 3. inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mating,
that he that doth not keep the commandements of God, doth not know
him: and again, <hi>He that ≈øaith he knoweth God, and keepeth not his commandements,
is a liar, and the truth is not in him,</hi> ver≈ø. 4. What Mini≈øters are you then; that not
onely preach contrary to the Letter of the Scripture, but al≈øo contrary to the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
of the Saints? <hi>Secondly</hi> you ≈øay there is no perfection to be attained here, and
≈øo preach a doctrine contrary to the Letter of the Scriptures, for Chri≈øt commanded
his Di≈øciples <hi>to be perfect, as their heavenly Father is perfect:</hi> and the Apo≈øtles doctrine
was for the <hi>perfecting of the Saints;</hi> and he ≈øaid <hi>he ≈øpake wi≈ødome among≈øt them that were
perfect:</hi> this being ≈øo, I ≈øhall leave all ≈øober men to judge, whether you be true
Mini≈øters of the Letter? and yet are ≈øo bold as to ≈øay, <hi>you make the Scriptures your
rule.</hi> I could clearly in≈øtance in many more particulars, that you are no true Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øters
of the Letter of the Scriptures, but the≈øe are ≈øufficient.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly</hi> I affirm, That you are not Mini≈øters of the Spirit neither, of which the
Apo≈øtles were able Mini≈øters, for you (contrary to the Scriptures, and to the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of our Lord Je≈øus Chri≈øt) ≈øay, <hi>That Revelation is cea≈øed:</hi> whenas our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
him≈øelf expre≈øsly ≈øaith, <hi>No man knoweth the Son but the Father, neither knoweth
any man the Father ≈øave the Son, and he to whom ≈øoever the Son will reveal him,</hi> Mat.
11. 27. So then its evident enough, that all you who deny Revelation, know neither
the Father, nor the Son: whom to know is life eternal, and without the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg
of whom you cannot know the mind of the Spirit: for the Spirit of the Lord
revealeth not the thing of its ≈øelf to any, but to tho≈øe that receive the teaching of
the Father and the Son; and no man can know the Father and the Son, but by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation.
So that it appears to all men of a good under≈øtanding, that you are nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Mini≈øters of the Spirit, nor of the Letter.</p>
            <p>Now ≈øince it is thus evident, that you are no Mini≈øters of the Spirit, as the true
Mini≈øters were, nor yet true Mini≈øters of the Letter; Who≈øe Mini≈øters may ≈øome ≈øay,
are they? I an≈øwer: You are Mini≈øters of Antichri≈øt, and found to be in the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> who≈øe belly is your god, who≈øe glory is your ≈øhame,
who mind earthly things: you are fruitle≈øs trees cumbring the ground, and who≈øe
end is to be burnt and con≈øumed by the breath of his mouth, and by the brightne≈øs of
his coming; and this will be your reward and portion without ≈øpeedy Repentance,
and turning from your wickedne≈øs, whereby you craftily deceive the ≈øimple, and
mi≈ølead the innocent whom the Lord will teach, for he hath ≈øaid, <hi>His people shall bee
all taught of him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:106951:5"/>
FRiend, my purpo≈øe is not to plead again≈øt a Go≈øpel-maintenance for Go≈øpel-Mini≈øters;
no, God forbid, for I own both; but to cry out again≈øt Tythes, and a forced maintenance,
as all men of ≈øobriety and moderation do, and mu≈øt do if they approve them≈øelves true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtians:
I ≈øay, the true Worshippers cannot maintain a fal≈øe Mini≈øtry, nor uphold the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of Idols, as well knowing they mu≈øt fall, together with all the Ceremonies and fal≈øe Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
practi≈øed and preached in them, and by them: Nor had I been found to di≈øcover thy
nakedne≈øs to the world, had≈øt thou not ≈øo vi≈øibly appeared to be cloathed with a shadow, and
to be found di≈øowning the Wedding-garment.</p>
            <p>And now let me ask thee, and tho≈øe of your generation and profe≈øsion, On who≈øe heads,
do you think, all the guilt of that blood that hath been shed in <hi>England</hi> for Tithes within
the≈øe ≈øeven years past, be≈øides the lo≈øs of goods and lives of many of the dear ≈øervants of the
Lord will light, if not on you who plead for, and will have Tithes, and force a maintenance
from the ≈øervants of God, contrary to their con≈øciences? Do you think to shuffle it off from
your≈øelves, and lay it upon the Civil Magi≈øtrates? O no! you cannot (though they are
not guiltle≈øs herein) the Lord will not be mocked; for you are the men who have robbed
the Lord of his honor, and his people of their goods, liberties, and lives, to put into your bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies,
and to uphold carnal Ordinances, which perish with the u≈øings and to keep alive your
dead Meetings, dead Prayers, dead Preachings, dead Doctrines, dead Fa≈øts, dead Exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øes,
and dead Mini≈øtry.</p>
            <div type="conclusion">
               <p>Friends, let me tell you, your foundation it in death, and therefore your dead Structure
will fall to the du≈øt, and the hou≈øe you have built, fall upon your own heads, all the powers
