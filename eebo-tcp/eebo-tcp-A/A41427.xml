            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Divine Providence hath hitherto so ordered my life, that for the greatest part thereof, I have lived (as it were) in exile from my native Countrey: which happened, partly, by reason of my education in the Romish Religion, and that in forraign Universities; and partly, by my entrance into Monasticall orders. For twelve years space of which time, I was wholly disposed of in that part of <hi>America</hi> called <hi>New-Spain,</hi> and the parts adjacent. My difficult going thither, being not permitted to any, but to those of the Spanish Nation; my long stay there; and lastly my returning home, not onely to my Country, but to the true knowledge and free-profession of the Gospels purity, gave me reason to conceive, That these great mercies were not appointed me by the heavenly Powers, to the end I should bury my Talent in the earth, or hide my light under a bushell, but that I should impart what I there saw and knew to the use
<pb facs="tcp:53246:3"/>
and benefit of my English Country-men; And which the rather <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap> held my self obliged unto, because in a manner nothing hath been written of these Parts for these hundred years last past, which is almost ever since the first Conquest thereof by the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards,</hi> who are contented to lose the honour of that wealth and felicity they have there since purchased by their great endevours, so they may enjoy the safety of retaining what they have formerly gotten in peace and security. In doing whereof, I shall offer no Collections, but such as shall arise from mine own observations, which will as much differ from what formerly hath been hereupon written, as the picture of a person grown to mans estate, from that which was taken of him when he was but a Childe; or the last hand of the Painter, to the first or rough draught of the picture. I am told by others, that this may prove a most acceptable work; but I doe tell my self, that it will prove both lame and imperfect, and therefore had need to shelter my self under the shadow of some high protection, which I humbly pray your Excellency to afford me; nothing doubting, but as God hath lately made your Excellency the happy instrument, not onely of saving my self, but of many numbers of godly and well affected people in this County of <hi>Kent,</hi> (where now I reside by the favour of the Parliament) from the imminent ruine and destruction plotted against them by their most implacable enemies; so the same God who <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>ath led your Excellency through so many difficulties towards the settlement of the peace of this Kingdom, and reduction of <hi>Ireland,</hi> will, after the perfecting thereof (which God of his mercy hasten) direct your Noble thoughts to employ the Souldiery of this Kingdom upon such just and honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable designes in those parts of <hi>America,</hi> as their want of action at home may neither be a burden to themselves nor the Kingdome. To your Excellency therefore I offer a <hi>New-World,</hi> to be the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of your future pains, valour, and piety, beseeching your accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of this plain but faithfull relation of mine, wherein your Excellency, and by you the English Nation shall see what wealth and honor they have lost by one of their narrow hearted Princes, who living in peace and abounding in riches, did notwithstanding reject the offer of being first discoverer of <hi>America<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> and left it unto <hi>Ferdinando</hi> of <hi>Arragon,</hi> who at the same time was wholly taken up by the Warrs, in gaining of the City and Kingdome of <hi>Granada</hi> from the <hi>Moores;</hi> being so impoverished thereby, that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap> glorious an expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. And yet, if time were closely followed at the heels, we are not so farr behinde, but we might yet take him by the fore-top. To which purpose, our Plantations of the <hi>Barbadoes, St. Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stophers, Mems,</hi> and the rest of the <hi>Caribe-Islands,</hi> have not onely advanced our journey the better part of the way; but so inured our people to the Clime of the <hi>Indies,</hi> as they are the more inabled thereby to undertake any enterprise upon the firm Land with greater facility. Neither is the difficulty of the attempt so great, as some may imagine; for I dare be bold to affirm it know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, That with the same pains and charge which they have been at in planting one of those pettie Islands, they might have conquer'd so many great Cities, and large Territories on the main Continent, as might very well merit the title of a Kingdome. Our Neighbors the <hi>Hollanders</hi> may be our example in this case; who whilst we have been driving a private Trade from Port to Port, of which we are likely now to be deprived, have conquered so much Land in the <hi>East</hi> and <hi>West-Indies,</hi> that it may be said of them, as of the <hi>Spaniards, That the Sunn never sets upon their Dominions.</hi> And to meet with that objection by the way, <hi>That the Spaniard being intituled to those Countries, it were both unlawfull and against all conscience to dispossess him thereof.</hi> I answer, that (the Popes donation excepted) I know no title he hath but force, which by the same title, and by a greater force may be repelled. And to bring in the title of <hi>First-discovery,</hi> to me it seems as little reason, that the sailing of a <hi>Spanish</hi> Ship upon the coast of <hi>India,</hi> should intitle the King of <hi>Spain</hi> to that Countrey, as the sayling of an <hi>Indian</hi> or <hi>English</hi> Ship upon the coast of <hi>Spain,</hi> should intitle either the <hi>Indians</hi> or <hi>English</hi> unto the Dominion thereof. No question but the just right or title to those Countries appertains to the Natives themselves; who, if they shall willingly and freely invite the <hi>English</hi> to their protection, what title soever they have in them, no doubt but they may legally transferr it or communicate it to others. And to say, That the inhumane butchery which the <hi>Indians</hi> did formerly commit in sacrificing of so many reasonable Creatures to their wicked Idols, was a sufficient war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant for the <hi>Spaniards</hi> to divest them of their Country; The same argument may by much better reason be inforced against the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

And policy having thus opened way to those <hi>American</hi> parts, the charges thus being laid upon the Crown of <hi>Spain,</hi> and the honour of a Royall Patrimony, with power over the Clergy thus conferred upon the Kings of <hi>Spain;</hi> how doth the Pope yeerly charge the Catholike King with troopes of Jesuites and Fryers to be conveyed thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? Now the Jesuites (the best scholars of <hi>Romes</hi> policy) seeing this to bee thus setled between the Pope and the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> for the increasing of their Order, and to suppresse the increase of other Religions there, have thought first of a way of chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenging all the <hi>India's</hi> to themselves, alleadging that <hi>Francis Xavierius</hi> companion of <hi>Ignatius Loiola</hi> was the first Preacher that ever preached in the <hi>East India's,</hi> and so by right that they being of his profession ought only to be sent thither.

No such hatred under heaven (saith hee) as that between a Formalist, and a Puritan, whereof our now Domestick and Civill Warres may bee a sad and woefull experience. A truth which made <hi>Paul</hi> burst out into a lamentable complaint, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16. 9. saying, <hi>A great doore and effectuall is opened unto mee, and there are many adversaries.</hi>

               <p>And as when the doore of true Faith once is opened, then Adversaries begin to swarme and rage; so in all points of false and fained Religion where the entrance to it is laid open, hatred and enmity will act their parts. But much more if with such pretended Religion, Wealth and Ambition as counterfeit Mates thrust hard to enter at the opened doore, what strife, hatred, and envy doe they kindle even in the hearts of such who have vowed poverty and the contempt of worldly wealth? I may adde to what hath beene observed above, that no hatred is comparable to that which is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene a Jesuite and a Fryer, or any other of <hi>Romes</hi> Religious Orders; And above all yet betweene a Jesuite, and a Dominican. The ambition and pride of Jesuites is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consistent in a Kingdome or Common-wealth with any such as may bee equall to them in Preaching, Counsell or Learning. Therefore strive they so much for the education of Gentlemens Children in their Colledges, that by teaching the sonnes, the love of the fathers and mothers may bee more easily gained: and their love and good will thus gained, they may withall gaine to themselves whatsoever praise, honour, glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry may bee fit to bee bestowed upon any other Ecclesiasticall Person. Which Policy and Ambition in them being so patent and knowne to all the World, hath stirred up in all other Religions a hatred to them uncapable ever of Reconciliation.

Well did that wise Senate conceive, that as one Noble man had been cheated by them of his fortunes, so might they one by one, and so at length the riches of <hi>Venice</hi> might become a treasure onely for Jesuites to maintaine the pride and pompe of their glorious fabricks. And though those vowed servants to the Pope obtained his Excommunication against the whole Estate of <hi>Venice</hi> upon non-complying with the foresaid Will and Testament; yet such was the preaching of all other Preists and Orders against them, that they caused the State to slight the Excommunication, and in lieu of making them heires of the deceased Senatours Estate, they shamefully banished them out of <hi>Venice.</hi> Thus also have the Preists and Fryers of <hi>Bis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="5" facs="tcp:53246:8"/>
Popes Letters they had banished him out of <hi>England.</hi> Which curtesie, the secular Preists gaining yet a head over them with title of Archdeacon, Doctor <hi>Champney,</hi> have ever since sought to repay home, by endeavouring alwayes to cast them out of <hi>England,</hi> as pernicious to the State of this Kingdome, more then Fryers or any other sort of Preists; Which they have sufficiently made known by discovering their covetousnesse in encroaching upon many Houses and Farmes, enriching themselves, as namely at <hi>Winifreds</hi> Well (so tearmed by them) where they had bought an Inne, and speedily fell to building there that they might make it a Colledge for Jesuites to entertaine there all Papists comers and goers to that Well, and so might win to themselves the hearts of most of the Papists of the Land, who doe yearly resort thither to bee washed and healed upon any light occasion either of Head-ach, Stomack-ach, Ague, want of children, where they blindly phansie a speedy remedy for all maladies, or wants of this World. Thus have the Preists discovered further our English Jesuites covetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse in the building of the Sope-houses at <hi>Lambeth</hi> under the name of Mr. <hi>George Gage</hi> their purse-bearer, and since projecting the Monopoly of Sope under Sir <hi>Richard W<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Thus came out the discovery of the Levelling of Hils and Mountaines, cutting of rocks at <hi>Leige</hi> in the Low Countryes at the Colledge of the English Jesuites, a worke for Gardens and Orchards for their Novices recreation and pastime, which (as I have heard from their owne mouthes) cost them thirty thousand pound, which gift they squeezed out of one onely Countesse of this Land. Like to this may prove their Colledge at <hi>Gaunt,</hi> for which they have obtained already a faire beginning of eight thousand pounds from the Old Countesse of <hi>Shrewsberry,</hi> and from the greatest part of the Estate of Mr. <hi>Sackefield,</hi> whom whilst they had him in their Colledges, they cherished with their best dainties, and with hopes that one day hee should bee a Canonized Saint of their Religious Order. All these knaveries doe even those Preists of the same Popish Religion discover of them, and thereby endeavor to make them odious. And though of all, the Jesuites be the most covetous, yet may I not excuse the Secular Preists, Benedictine Monks, and the Fryers from this damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable sinne; who also strive for wealth and meanes for their <hi>Doway, Paris</hi> and <hi>Li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>sse one another, and having vowed Poverty, yet make they the Conversion of <hi>England</hi> the onely object of their Ambition and unsatiable Covetousnesse. But above all is this envy and hatred found between Dominicans and Jesuites, for these owe unto them an old grudge, for that when <hi>Ignatius Loiola</hi> lived, his Doctrine <hi>de Trinitate</hi> (which hee pretended was revealed to him from heaven, for hee was certainely past the Age of studying at his Conversion) was questioned by the Dominicans, and hee by a Church Censure publickly and shamefully whipped about their Cloisters for his erroneous principles. This affront done to their chief Patron hath stirred up in them an unreconciliable hatred towards the Order of the Dominicans, and hath made them even cracke their braines to oppose <hi>Thomas Aquinas</hi> his Doctrine. How shamefully doe those two Orders indeavour the destruction of each other, bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding one another with calumnies of heresie in the Opinions especially <hi>de Conceptione Mariae, de libero arbitrio, de Auxiliis?</hi> And of the two, the Jesuites is more bold and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinate in malice and hatred. How did they some twenty yeares agoe, all <hi>Spaine</hi> over, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Conception of <hi>Mary</hi> stirre up the people against the Dominicans, in so much that they were in the very streets tearmed Hereticks, stones cast at them, the King almost perswaded to banish them out of all his Dominions, and they poore Fryers forced to stand upon their Guard in their Cloisters in many Cities, especially in <hi>Sevill, Osuna, Antiquera</hi> and <hi>Cordova.</hi> to defend themselves from the rude and furious multitude.

had caused to be printed; hee was forced to contesse his knavery, was harshly repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended, and with the apprehension of that great affront, the next night gave up his ghost to his father, the father of lies and falshood.</p>
               <p>An other reason of this mortall enmity between these two Orders, is for that the Jesuites surpasse all others in ambition of honour, credit, and estimation, whence it is they cannot indure to behold the Dominicans to exceed them in any preferment. Now it is that by the Laws of <hi>Arragon</hi> and the Kingdome of <hi>Valencia,</hi> the Kings of <hi>Spain</hi> are tied to have a Dominican Fryer for their Confessor or ghostly father; which could but the Jesuites obtain, how would they then rule and govern <hi>Spain</hi> and the Kings heart? But though they could never yet prevail to alter this established law, yet have they prevailed now lately so that <hi>Antonio de Sotomayor</hi> the King of <hi>Spains</hi> Confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor should lie at rest in the Court of <hi>Madrid,</hi> with a pension and dry title only; and that <hi>Florencia</hi> that grand Statist should be Confessor to the Count of <hi>Olivares,</hi> the Royall Issue, the Queen, and should hear the Kings confessions oftner then his chosen and elected Confessor <hi>Sotomayor.</hi> Secondly, the Dominicans as first Authors of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisition (which they prove from their Martyr <hi>Peter</hi> of <hi>Verona</hi>) still enjoy the highest places of that Court, which is a wofull sight to the Jesuites to see their Religion af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires handled, their Church kept pure from what they call heresy by any but them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. O had they (as they have often strived for it) in their hands the judicature of that tribunall, how should all Dominicans, nay all sorts of Preists but their own, presently by them be branded with heresy? Thirdly, in <hi>Rome</hi> there is an other prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment successively due to Dominicans, from the time of <hi>Dominicus de Guzman</hi> founder of that Religion, to wit, to be <hi>magister Sacri Palatii,</hi> the Popes Palace master, instituted to this purpose that about him there may be some learned Divine (for commonly the Popes are more Statists, and Canonists, then Divines) to read a daily lecture of Divinity to such as will be instructed therein, and to resolve the Pope himselfe of whatsoever dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult points in Divinity may be questioned. This is the Dominicans due with a pensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to maintain Coach and servants within the Palace of <hi>St<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Peter.</hi> Which the Jesuites have often by favour and cunning Jesuiticall trickes endeavoured to bereave the Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicans of; but proving labour in vain, they continue still in their unplacable enmity and hatred against them. And thus you see the fountaines of their strife; which as here in <hi>Europe</hi> hath been well seen, so hath this contentious fire overpowered the fire of their zeal of soules in the <hi>East</hi> and <hi>West-India's;</hi> and the wealth and riches of those Countries, the ambition of honor in their Gospel function hath more powerfully drawn them thither, then (what they pretend) the conversion of a barbarous and idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous nation.

At that time the Jesuites pretended that mission to themselves only, and petitioned the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> that only they might go thither to preach, having been the first plantation of <hi>Franciscus Xavier,</hi> and since continued successively by their Priests. To this purpose they remembred the King of the great charges he was at in sending so many Fryers and maintaining them there; all which should be saved, might they only have free ingresse into those Kingdomes.

of trading, into the Emperours favour by gifts of Watches, Clocks, Dials, Lockes, and Cabinets, and such like presents of most curious and artificiall Workmanship, that they had got free accesse to his Court, and counselled him to beware of Fryers, which cunningly crept into his Kingodme to preach a new law, perswading him by rigorous search and enquiries to root them out: thus politickly for their own ends hindering the increase of Christianisme by any means or instruments save themselves; and blinding the Emperors eyes with their cunning insinuations, that he might not see in them, what they desired he might discover in others, that they might appear in sheep skins, and others clothed with wolves skins; and so the Fryers might have little heart to trade, but enough to doe to save themselves from the stormy persecution, whilst they freely might enjoy the liberty of rich trading. This brand upon these cunning foxes was commanded to be printed, thankes given to <hi>Diego Colliado</hi> for discovering to the Estate their crafty proceedings, with not a few tenents maintained by them in <hi>Iapan</hi> even a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst their owne Soveraigne; a fat Bishoprick was offered to the Fryer, which he refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, commission was given unto him for the raising of forty Fryers out of <hi>Spain,</hi> and the conducting of them to the Islands of <hi>Philippinas,</hi> and that it should be free for all Preists and Fryers, as well as Jesuites, to passe to those parts for the preaching of Christ and the extending of Christianisme among the Heathens and Barbarians. O that this my discovery made to <hi>England</hi> of those dissembling and false Preists, would make us wise to know and discover under the ashes of their pretended Religion, the fire of strife and contention which they kindle in Kingdomes, and to rake up that covetousnesse, which we may easily find in them; tending to the ruine of many fair estates, and to the temporall and spirituall danger of this our flourishing Kingdome!</p>

               <p>All the Kingdomes of <hi>America,</hi> that have been conquered by the Kings of <hi>Spain,</hi> are divided as into severall temporall governments, so into severall spirituall juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions, under the name of Provinces, belonging unto severall religious Orders, and their Provincials. These though so farre distant from <hi>Europe,</hi> yet live with a depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency and subordination unto the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> and are bound to send thither a strict account and relation of what most remarkable passages and successes happen there, as also what want of Preachers there is in every severall Province. Which is to be performed in this manner. Every religious Order (except the Jesuites and Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicans, whose Generall continueth till death, unlesse a Cardinals cap be bestowed upon him) maketh election of one of the same order to be the head Ruler, or (as they call him) Generall over all those of the same profession every sixth year. The subjects unto this Generall which are dispersed in <hi>Italy, Germany, Flanders, France, Spain, East</hi> and <hi>West-India's</hi> are divided into sundry Provinces, as in <hi>Spain</hi> there is one Province of <hi>Andaluzia,</hi> another of <hi>Castilia nu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Every Province of these hath a head named the Provinciall, chosen by the chief of the Province every three years; which election is called a Provinciall Chapter, and the former a Generall Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which also is allotted to be in some chief City, commonly in <hi>Italy, France,</hi> or <hi>Spain.</hi> When the Provinciall Chapter is kept, then by the consent of all that meet in it is there one named by name of Procurator or Diffinitor, who is to goe in the name of the whole Province to the next election of the Generall, and there to demand such things as his Province shall think fit, and to give an account of the state of the Province from whence he is sent. Thus from the <hi>West-India's</hi> are sent Procurators, who commonly are the best prizes the <hi>Holland</hi> ships meet with, for that they carry with them great wealth, and gifts to the Generalls, to the Popes and Cardinals and Nobles in <hi>Spain,</hi> as bribes to facilitate whatsoever just or unjust, right or wrong they are to demand<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Among other businesses their charge is this, to make known the great want of labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers

               <p>The Order of the Province being read to the Generall, or his Generall Chapter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> then are Letters Patents granted unto this Procurator from the Generall, naming him his Vicar Generall for such a Province, and declaring his sufficiency and worthy parts, (though none at all in him, as I have beene witnesse of some) the great paines hee hath taken in the new planted <hi>Indian</hi> Church, and how fit hee hath been judged to convey to those parts, a Mission of such as shall voluntarily offer themselves for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagation of Christianity amongst those Barbarians. Then the tauny <hi>Indian</hi> Fryer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing well set out with high Commendations, and fairly painted with flattering Elogies, presents these his Patents (and with them peradventure a little wedge of Gold, a Box of Pearles, some Rubies or Diamonds, a Chest of Cochinill, or Sugar, with some boxes of curious Chocolatte, or some feather works of <hi>Mechoacan,</hi> some small fruits of his great paines and labour) to the Pope; who for his first reward gives him his Toe and Pantofle to kisse, seconding this honour with a joyfull countenance to behold an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle, judging him worthy of the best of the <hi>Indian</hi> wealth, and his soule peradventure fit for the title of a Saint; This complacency in the gift and the giver, breeds imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately a <hi>motus proprius</hi> in his Holinesse to grant a Bull with a degree of the Popes Commissary, wherein this poore Mendicant Fryer is inabled to runne over all the Cloisters of his Profession in <hi>Spain,</hi> to gather up his thirty or forty yong Preachers. Who for their better encouragement are at their first listing by the Popes Authority ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved <hi>á culpa &amp; àpaena,</hi> from all sinne, and from their Purgatory and Hell due unto it, by a plenary Indulgence. And whosoever shall oppose, or any way discourage this Popes Commissary, or those that are or would be listed by him, are <hi>ipso facto</hi> excommunicated with an Anathem reserved only to this Commissary or his Holiness himself. O what is it to see, when such a Commissaries coming is knowen, how the young birds, that as in Cages are shut up within the walls of a Cloister, leap and cherish themselves with hopes of liberty? What is it to see disordered Fryers, who for their misdemeanours, and leaping over their Cloister wals in the night to find out their wanton harlots, have been imprisoned, now rejoyce at the coming of a Popes Commissary, and Plenary Indulgence, freeing them from sinnes past, and sitting them for the Conversion of souls, though there one be not averted from their Harlot, nor as yet truly and unfainedly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted to the love of God?

liberty they could never injoy in <hi>Spain,</hi> and this liberty is the Midwife of so many soule falls of wicked Fryers in those parts. For the present onely, I shall return again to my Fryer <hi>Iohn Navarro,</hi> who at his comming to <hi>Guatemala,</hi> being made for his wit and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, Master and Reader of Divinity, and much esteemed of for his acute Preaching, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong many others got the estimation and love of a chief Gentlewoman, (<hi>Quo semel est imbuta recens servabit odorem, testa diu</hi>) who continued in <hi>Navarro</hi> his heart the former sent of the unchast love of <hi>Amaryllis,</hi> so far that the Fryer being blinded and wounded with <hi>Cupids</hi> Arrow sticking in his heart, ran headlong to quench his lustfull thirst upon St. <hi>Iames</hi> his day, 1635. for better memory of the Tragical event (being the Spaniards com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Advocate, and speciall Patron of that City, named St. <hi>Iago de Guatemala</hi>) where cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell <hi>Mars</hi> oppressing <hi>Venus</hi> in her wanton Acts, the injured husband acting <hi>Mars,</hi> &amp; find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Navarro Cupids</hi> page saluting his <hi>Venus</hi> upon her bed, drew his sword, cutting the Fryer first in the head and face; who strugling with death, and purchasing his life with a swift and nimble flight to a Garden, where his own brother a Fryer of the same Order, &amp; Pander to that foul act, entertained the Motherlesse children; for the husband having missed his fatall blow (willingly as some imagined, or unwillingly as others judged) in the Fryers heart, wilfully laid it in the throat of his unchast Wife, scarce leaving way for breath to make a speedy Confession of her sinne to <hi>Navarro</hi> his Brother; who ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring her soule as much as his Brother had tendred her body absolved her from her sinne, finding signes, though no uttering speech of Repentance, while the murderer fled, and the murdered lay in the doore of her house for a sad object to all, that imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately flocked thither to see that bloody Tragedy. The Wife being the same day buried, the Husband being retired to a close Sanctuary, <hi>Navarro</hi> was carried to his Convent to bee cured; and after his Cure was banished that Country; whom two yeares after it was my chance to meet in <hi>Cartagena</hi> returning to <hi>Spain</hi> with his scard face, bearing the marke of his lascivious life, and of that liberty which hee had injoyed in <hi>America.</hi> Such are the fruits of the zeale of those wretches, who upbraid our Church and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters for want of zeale to labour in the Conversion of Infidels. Who when they ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive to those parts, are entertained with ringing of Bells, with sounding of Trumpets most part of the way as they travaile, and as Apostles are received by the <hi>Indians,</hi> though soon like <hi>Iudas</hi> they fall from their calling, and for pleasure and covetousnesse sell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way Christ from their Soules. <hi>England</hi> may here learn to beware of such Converters, who are daily by name of Missionaries sent hither by the Pope to preach among us Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery; but like <hi>Navarro</hi> come to feed and cherish their wanton lusts, as I could give ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny instances, might I not be censured for long digressions in mingling English Histories with my <hi>American</hi> Travailes.</p>

               <p>IN all the Dominions of the King of <hi>Spain</hi> in <hi>America,</hi> there are two sorts of Spaniards more opposite one to another then in <hi>Europe</hi> the Spaniard is opposite to the French, or to the Hollander, or to the Portingall; To wit, they that are born in any parts of <hi>Spain</hi> and goe thither, and they that are borne there of Spanish parents, whom the Spaniards, to distinguish them from themselves, terme <hi>Criolio's,</hi> signifying the Natives of that Countrey. This hatred is so great, that I dare say, nothing might bee more advantagious then this, to any other Nation that would conquer <hi>America.</hi> And no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more easily gained, then the Wils and affections of the Natives of the Country, to joyne with any other Nation to free and rescue themselves from that subjection, or kind of slavery, which they suffer under the hard usage of the Spaniards, and their partiall Government and justice toward them, and those that come from <hi>Spain.</hi> This is so grievous to the poore Criolio's or Natives, that my selfe have often heard them say, They would rather bee subject to any other Prince, nay to the Hollanders, then

This mortall ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred betwixt these two sorts of <hi>Spaniards,</hi> made the Criolio's so ready to joyn against the Marquesse of <hi>Gelues</hi> Viceroy of <hi>Mexico,</hi> in the tumult and mutiny of that City, wherein they cleaving to <hi>Don Alonso de Zerna,</hi> the Arch-Bishop caused the Viceroy to escape for his life by flight, and would then have utterly rooted out the Spanish Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, had not some Preists disswaded them from it; but of this I shall speak more largely hereafter. The cause of this deadly hatred hath proceeded from a jealousie which the <hi>Spaniards</hi> have ever had of the Criolio's, that they would faine withdraw themselves first from the commerce with <hi>Spain,</hi> and secondly, from the Government which is laid upon them; which is such, that the Criolio's must be alwaies under, and a subject, alwaies governed, but scarce any a Governour. Never yet was there seen any Criolio made Viceroy of <hi>Mexico,</hi> or <hi>Peru;</hi> or President of <hi>Guatemala,</hi> or <hi>Santafe,</hi> or S. <hi>Domingo;</hi> or Governour of <hi>Yucatan, Cartagena, Havana;</hi> or <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

So likewise in the Courts of Chancery, as <hi>S<hi rend="sup">to.</hi> Domingo, Mexico, Guate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mala, Lima,</hi> and the rest; where commonly there are Six, called <hi>Oydores</hi> and one <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scal,</hi> scarce one of them to be found a Criolio, or native of the Countrey; though there be among them those that descended of the chief Conquerors; as in <hi>Lima</hi> and <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ru</hi> the <hi>Pizarros,</hi> in <hi>Mexico</hi> and <hi>Guaxaca</hi> the house of the Marquesse <hi>Dell Valle, Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nando Cortes</hi> his Successors, others of the house of <hi>Giron,</hi> others of the house of <hi>Alu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arado,</hi> others of the <hi>Gusmanes,</hi> finally many of the chiefest houses of <hi>Spain;</hi> yet none of these ever preferred to any dignity. And not onely thus are they kept from offices, but daily affronted by the <hi>Spaniards</hi> as uncapable of any Government, and termed halfe <hi>Indians</hi> by them.</p>
               <p>Which generall contempt hath also spread it selfe in the Church, where no Criolio Preist is scarce ever preferred to be a Bishop, or Canon in a Cathredall Church, but all such as come from <hi>Spain.</hi> So likewise in the religious orders they have many years indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vored to keep under and suppress such as have bin admitted to their orders of the natives of the Countrey, lest the number of them should prevail against those that are brought from <hi>Spain;</hi> they have been very nice in choosing of them, &amp; though they have been for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to admit of some, yet stil the Provincials, the Priors, and all Superiors have been <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi> born in <hi>Spain.</hi> Till now lately some Provinces have got the upper hand and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed against the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> &amp; have so filled their cloisters with Criolio's or natives, that they have utterly refused to admit the supplies of <hi>Spanish</hi> Missions which formerly were sent unto them, and till this day are sent to others. In the Province of <hi>Mexico</hi> there are Dominicans, Franciscans, Augustines, Carmelites, Mercenarians, and Jesuites, whereof the Jesuites and Carmelites only to this day prevail against Criolio's, bringing every two or three years Missions from <hi>Spain.</hi> The last Mission that was sent to the Mercenarians was the year 1625. and then was the opposition such between that Mission and the Criolio's, that in the election of the next Provinciall in their Cloister of <hi>Mexico,</hi> the Fryers drew knives one against another, and were like to kill each other, had not the Viceroy gone to their Cloister to make peace, and imprison some of them. Yet at last by the multitude of voices the native partly prevailed, and till this day have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted themselves from <hi>Spanish</hi> Missions, alleadging (as others have done) that they have Fryers enough in their Cloisters, and need none to be sent them from <hi>Spain;</hi> sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting themselves to the Pope, and presenting to him as stately gifts as ever <hi>Spaniards</hi> did before them. In the Province of <hi>Guaxaca</hi> none admit of Missionaries from <hi>Spain;</hi> true it is the Dominicans are but newly subdued by the Criolian party; and as yet are strongly pleading at <hi>Rome</hi> for <hi>Spanish</hi> Fryers, alleadging that the glory and lustre of their Religion hath been much blurred since the non-admittance of supplies of their zealous Compatriots. The Province of <hi>Guatemala,</hi> (which is of a large extent) containing <hi>Guatemala, Chiapa,</hi> the <hi>Zoques,</hi> part of <hi>Tabasco,</hi> the <hi>Zeldales,</hi> the <hi>Sacapu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las,</hi> the <hi>Vera Paz,</hi> all the coast lying to the South sea <hi>Suchu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="11" facs="tcp:53246:11"/>
whereof the three orders of Dominicans, Franciscans, and Mercenarians, are the only Preachers and parish Preists throughout all the forenamed Provinces. And these three Orders have still kept under the Criolian party, never as yet suffering any of them to be Provinciall, bringing every two or three years some one year and some another, Missions of Fryers from <hi>Spain</hi> to maintain and keep up their faction against the Crio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians. The Provinces of <hi>Peru</hi> being more distant from <hi>Spain,</hi> and hard to come to by sea, have no Missions sent unto them. There are of the most Romish religious orders, yet the chief are Dominicans; and they all live above their vow of poverty, abounding in wealth, riot, liberty and pleasures. In the Kingdome of <hi>Nuevo reino de Granada,</hi> and <hi>Cartagena, Santa fee, Barinas, Popayan,</hi> and the government of <hi>St. Martha,</hi> are Dominicans, Jesuites, Franciscans, Carmelites, Augustines and Mercenarians; whereof the Dominicans, Jesu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ites and Franciscans till this day admit of Missions from <hi>Spain.</hi> The Island of <hi>Cuba, Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maica, la Margarita, Puerto rico,</hi> all are subject to the head Provinciall of <hi>Santo Domingo,</hi> being Dominicans, Jesuites, and Franciscans, and have all now and then Missions from <hi>Spain.

And though they admit of some few Crioli'os among them, especially some of their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts of <hi>China</hi> and <hi>Iapan;</hi> yet their chief number and strength is of Spanish Missio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries, who are more frequently conveyed thither then to the parts afore-mentioned of <hi>America.</hi> First they are sent in the ships that are bound for <hi>Nueva Espana</hi> and <hi>Mex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ico;</hi> and after they have rested two or three moneths in <hi>Mexico,</hi> they are sent to <hi>Aca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulco,</hi> lying on the <hi>Mar del Zur,</hi> there they are shipped in two great Caracks which year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly go and come richly laden with <hi>China, Iapan,</hi> and all <hi>East-India</hi> ware from <hi>Manila</hi> to <hi>Acapulco</hi> to enrich <hi>Mexico</hi> with farre greater riches then any are sent by the North sea from <hi>Spain.</hi> The voiage from <hi>Acapulco</hi> thither, is longer then from <hi>Spain</hi> to <hi>Mexico,</hi> and easy and pleasant, though the return is farre longer and most dangerous. The year of our Lord 1625. there were four Missions sent; the one of Franciscans to <hi>Yuca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan,</hi> the other of Mercenarians to <hi>Mexico,</hi> the other two of Dominicans and Jesuites to <hi>Philippinas.</hi> At which time it was my fortune to reside among the Dominicans in <hi>Xerez</hi> in <hi>Andaluzia.</hi> The Popes Commissary for that Mission was Fryer <hi>Matheo de la Villa,</hi> who having a Commission for thirty and having gathered some 24 of them about <hi>Castilia</hi> and <hi>Madrid,</hi> sent them by degrees well stored with mony to <hi>Cales,</hi> to take up a convenient lodging for himselfe and the rest of his crew, till the time of the set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting forth of the <hi>Indian</hi> Fleet. This Commissary named one Fryer <hi>Antonio Calvo</hi> to be his substitute, and to visit the Cloisters of <hi>Andaluzia</hi> lying in his way; namely <hi>Cordo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va, Sevill, S<hi rend="sup">t.</hi> Lucar,</hi> and <hi>Xerez,</hi> to try if out of them he could make up his compleat number of thirty, which was after fully compleated. About the end of <hi>May</hi> came this worthy <hi>Calvo</hi> to <hi>Xerez,</hi> and in his Company one <hi>Antonio Melendez</hi> of the Colledge of <hi>S<hi rend="sup">t.</hi> Gregory</hi> in <hi>Valladolid,</hi> with whom I had formerly neer acquaintance. This <hi>Melendez</hi> greatly rejoyced when he had found mee; and being well stocked with <hi>Indian</hi> Patacones, the first night of his coming invited me to his chamber to a stately supper. The good <hi>Xerez</hi> Sack which was not spared, set my friend in such a heat of zeale of converting <hi>Iaponians,</hi> that all his talke was of those parts never yet seen, and at least six thousand leagues distant. <hi>Bacehus</hi> metamorphosed him from a Divine into a Orator, and made him a <hi>Cicero</hi> in parts of Rhetoricall eloquence. Nothing was omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that might exhort mee to joyne with him in that function, which he thought was Apostolicall. <hi>Nemo Propheta in patria sua,</hi> was a great argument with him; sometimes he propounded Martyrdome for the Gospel sake, and the glory after it, to have his life and death printed, and of poore Fryer <hi>Antony</hi> a C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

But when he thought this Rhetoricke had not prevailed, then would he act a

                  <hi>Midas</hi> and <hi>Craesus,</hi> fancying the <hi>India's</hi> paved with tiles of gold and silver, the stones to be Pearls, Rubies, and Diamonds, the trees to bee hung with clusters of nutmegs bigger then the clusters of grapes of <hi>Canaan,</hi> the fields to be planted with Sugar Canes, which should so sweeten the <hi>Chocolattae,</hi> that it should farre exceed the milke and hony of the land of promise; the silkes of <hi>China</hi> hee conceited so common, that the failes of the ships were nothing else; finally he dreamed of <hi>Midas</hi> happinesse, that whatsoever he touched should be turned to gold: Thus did <hi>Xerez</hi> Nectar make my friend and mortified Fryer, a covetous worldling. And yet from a rich covetous Merchant did it shape him to a Courtier in pleasures; fancying the <hi>Philippinas</hi> to be the <hi>Eden,</hi> where was all joy without teares, mirth without sadnesse, laughing without sorrow, comfort without griefe, plenty without want, no not of <hi>Eves</hi> for <hi>Adams,</hi> excepted only that in it should be no forbidden fruit, but all lawfull for the taste and sweetning of the palate; and as <hi>Adam</hi> would have been as God, so conceited <hi>Melendez</hi> himselfe a God in that <hi>Eden;</hi> whom travelling, <hi>Indian</hi> Waites and trumpets should accompany; and to whom, entring into any Town, nosegaies should be presented, flowers and boughes should be strowed in his way, Arches should be erected to ride under, B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

From this inducing argument, and representation of a Paradise, he fell into a strong Rhetoricall point of curiosity; finding out a tree of knowledge, and a Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophicall maxime, <hi>Omnis homo naturaliter scire desiderat,</hi> man naturally inclines to know more and more; which knowledge he fancied could be no where more furnished with rare curiosities then in those parts; for there should the Gold and Silver, which here are fingered, in their growth in the bowels of the earth be known; there should the pepper be known in its season, the nutmeg and Clove, the Cinnamon as a rine or bark on a tree; the fashioning of the Sugar from a green growing Cane into a loaf; the strange shaping the <hi>Cochinil</hi> from a worme to so rich a Scarlet die; the changing of the <hi>Tinta</hi> which is but grasse with stalke and leaves into an <hi>Indigo</hi> black dye, should be taught and learned; and without much labour thus should our ignorance be instructed with various and sundry curiosities of knowledge and understanding. Finally, though <hi>Xe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rez</hi> liquor (grapes bewitching tears) had put this bewitching eloquence into my <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonies</hi> brain) yet he doubted not to preferre before it his wine of <hi>Philippinas,</hi> grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on tall and high trees of <hi>Coco,</hi> wherein he longed to drinke a Spanish Brindis in my company to all his friends remaining behind in <hi>Spain.</hi> Who would not bee moved by these his arguments to follow him, and his <hi>Calvo,</hi> or ball pated Superiour?

To whom I answered, suddain resolutions might bring future grief and sorrow, and that I should that night lye down and take counsell with my pillow, assuring him that for his sake I would doe much, and that if I resolved to goe, my resolution should draw on an other friend of mine, an Irish Fryer, named <hi>Thomas Delcon.</hi> Thus tooke I my leave of my <hi>Melendez,</hi> and retired my self to my chamber and bed, which that night was no place of repose and rest to me as formerly it had been. I must needs say <hi>Melendez</hi> his arguments, though most of them moved me not; yet the opportunity offered me to hide my self from all sight and knowledge of my dearest friends, stirred up in me a serious thought of an angry and harsh letter, which not long before I had received out of <hi>England</hi> from mine own father, signifying unto me the displeasure of most of my friends and kindred, and his own grievous indignation against me, for that having spent so much money in training me up to learning, I had not only utrerly refused to be of the Jesuites Order (which was his only hopes) but had proved in my affections a deadly foe and enemy unto them.

These reasons stole that nights rest from my body, and sleep from my eyes, teares keeping them unclosed and open, lest <hi>Cynthia's</hi> black and mourning Mantle should offer to cover, close and shut them. To this Letters considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was joyned a strong opposition, which serious Studies &amp; ripenesse of Learning, with a carefull discussion of some Schoole-points and Controversies had bred in mee against some chief of the Popish Tenents. Well could I have wished to have come to <hi>England,</hi> there to satisfie and ease my troubled Conscience; well considered I, that if I stayed in <hi>Spain,</hi> when my Studies were compleatly finished, the Dominicans with a Popes Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damus would send me home for a Missionary to my Country. But then well considered I the sight of a wrathfull Father, the power of a furious Brother a Colonell, who (as now landed in <hi>England</hi> to search me out, and do me mischief) then, when <hi>Zephryus</hi> with a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant gale seconded his Popish zeale, might violently assault mee. Well considered I the increased rout and rable of both their great friends, the Jesuites, who what with Court friends power, what with subtile plots and Policies would soone and easily hunt me out of <hi>England.</hi> Lastly, well considered I my <hi>Melendez</hi> his last inducing Argument of the increase of knowledge naturall by the insight of rich <hi>America</hi> and flourishing <hi>Asia,</hi> and of knowledge spirituall by a long contemplation of that new planted Church, and of those Church Planters lives and Conversations. Wherefore after a whole nights strife and inward debate, as the glorious Planet began to banish nights dismall horror, rising with a bright and cheerefull countenance, rose in my minde a firme and setled re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution to visit <hi>America,</hi> and there to abide till such time as Death should surprise my angry Father, <hi>Ignatius Loiola</hi> his devoted Mecaenas, and till I might there gain out of <hi>Potosi</hi> or <hi>Sacatecas</hi> treasure that might Counterpoise that Childs part, which for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testing the foure Cornered Cap, and black Coat of Jesuites, my Father had deprived mee of. So in recompence of the Supper which my friend <hi>Anthony</hi> had bestowed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on mee, I gave him a most pleasing breakfast by discovering unto him my purpose and resolution to acompany him in his long and Navall journey.

The Town thought their Streets blessed with our walking in them, and wished they might injoy some Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques from us, whom they beheld as appointed to Martyrdome for Christ and Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christs sake together; the Galley slaves strived who should sound their Waits and Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets most joyfully, <hi>Don Frederique</hi> spared no cost in Fish and Flesh that night, doubting not but that receiving foure Prophets, hee should receive a fourefold reward hereafter.

But at last having overcome the danger of this Golfe, the eight Galeons took their leave of us, and left our Merchant ships now to shift for themselves. The departure of these Galeons was most solemnly performed on each side, saluting each other with their Ordnance, visiting each other with their Cock-boates, the Admirall of the Fleet feasting with a stately dinner in his ship, the Admirall of the Galeons; and the like performing most of the other ships to the severall Colonells and Captains and other their allied friends that were of the Roi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Fleet. Here it was worth noting to heare the sighes of many of our <hi>Indian</hi> Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, wishing they might return again in any of those Galeons to <hi>Spain;</hi> their zeal was now cold, and some endeavoured many waies for <hi>Calvo</hi> his licence to returne (which
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:53246:14"/>
could not be granted) others imployed themselves most of that day in writing letters to their friends, and Sisters in <hi>Cales.</hi> Thus dinner being ended, and the two Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralls solemnly taking their leaves, the warning piece being shot off for the Galeons to joyn together, and turne their course to <hi>Spain,</hi> we bad mutuall adieu, crying one to another <hi>Buen Viaie, Buen passage;</hi> we kept our course towards <hi>America,</hi> sailing before the wind constantly till we came to <hi>America;</hi> a thing worth noting in that voiage from <hi>Spain</hi> to the <hi>Indies;</hi> that after the Islands of <hi>Canaria</hi> are once left, there is one constant wind, continuing to <hi>America</hi> still the same without any opposition or contrariety of other winds; and this so prosperous and full on the sailes, that did it blow constantly, and were it not interrupted with many calmes, doubtlesse the voiage might be ended in a moneth or lesse. But such were the calmes that many times we had, that we got not to the sight of any land till the twentieth day of <hi>August:</hi> so that neer six weeks we sailed as on a river of fresh water, much delighting and sporting our selves in fishing many sorts fishes, but especially one, which by the <hi>Spaniards</hi> is called <hi>Dorado,</hi> the golden fish, for the skin and scales of it that glitter like gold; of this sort we found such abundance, that no sooner was the hooke with any small bait cast into the sea, when presently the <hi>Dorado</hi> was caught, so that we tooke them many times for pleasure, and cast them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine into the sea, being a fish fitter to be eaten fresh then salted. Many were the feasts and sports used in the ships, till wee discovered the first land, or Island called <hi>Desseada.</hi> The last day of <hi>Iuly</hi> (being according to the Jesuites Order, and <hi>Romes</hi> appointment, the day of <hi>Ignatius</hi> their Patron and founder of their Religion) the gallant ship cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>S<hi rend="sup">ta.</hi> Gertrudis</hi> (wherein went 30 Jesuites) for theirs and their Saints sake made to all the rest of the Fleet a most gallant shew, shee being trimmed round about with white linnen, her flags and top gallants representing some the Jesuites arms, others the picture of <hi>Ignatius</hi> himself, and this from the evening before, shooting off that night at least fifty shot of Ordinance, besides four or five hundred squibs (the weather being very calme) and all her masts and tacklings hung with paper Lanthornes having burning lights within them; the waits ceased not from sounding, nor the <hi>Spaniards</hi> from singing all night. The daies solemne sport was likewise great, the Jesuites increasing the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi> joy with an open procession in the ship; singing their superstitions Hymnes and Anthemes to their supposed Saint, and all this seconded with roaring Ordnance, no powder being spared for the compleating of that daies joy and triumph. The fourth of <hi>August</hi> following, being the day which <hi>Rome</hi> doth dedicate to <hi>Dominick,</hi> the first the founder of the Dominicans or Preachers Order, the ship wherein I was, named <hi>St. Ambony,</hi> strived to exceed <hi>S<hi rend="sup">ta.</hi> Gertrudis,</hi> by the assistance of the 27 Dominicans that were in her. All was performed both by night and day; as formerly in <hi>S<hi rend="sup">ta.</hi> Gertrudis,</hi> both with powder, squibs, lights, Waits and musick. And further did the Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans joy and triumph exced the Jesuites, in that they invited all the Jesuites, with <hi>Don Iohn Nino de Toledo</hi> the President of <hi>Manila,</hi> with the Captaine of the ship of <hi>S<hi rend="sup">ta.</hi> Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trudis,</hi> to a stately dinner both of Fish and Flesh; which dinner being ended, for the afternoones sport they had prepared a Comedy out of famous <hi>Lope de Vega,</hi> to be acted by some Souldiers, Passengers and some of the younger sort of Fryers; which I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse was as stately acted and set forth both in shewes and good apparell, in that narrow compasse of our ship, as might have been upon the best stage in the Court of <hi>Madrid.</hi> The Comedy being ended, and a banquet of sweet meates prepared for the closing up of that daies mirth, both ours, and <hi>S<hi rend="sup">ta.</hi> Gertrudis</hi> Cock-boat carried backe our invited friends, bidding each other adieu with our Waits and chiefest Ordnance. Thus went we on our Sea Voiage without any storme, with pleasant gales, many calmes, dayly sports and pastimes till we discovered the first land called <hi>Desseada</hi> upon the twentieth day of <hi>August.</hi>

               <p>THe Admirall of our Fleet wondring much at our slow sailing, who from the second of <hi>Iuly</hi> to the 19 of <hi>August</hi> had seen nor discovered any land, save only the Islands of <hi>Canaria;</hi> the same day in the morning called to Councell all the Pilots of the ships,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:53246:14"/>
to know their Opinions concerning our present being, and the neernesse of Land. The Ships therefore drew neere unto the Admirall one by one, that every Pilot might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver his opinion. Here was cause of laughter enough, for the passengers to heare the wise Pilots skil; One saying, we were three hundred miles, another two hundred, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther one hundred, another fifty, another more, another lesse, all erring much from the truth (as afterward appeared) save onely one old Pilot of the smallest Vesse<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap> of all, who affirmed resolutely, that with that small gale wherewith wee then sailed, wee should come to <hi>Guadalupe</hi> the next morning. All the rest laughed at him, but he might well have laughed at them, for the next morning by Sun-rising wee plainly discovered an Island called <hi>Desseada</hi> by the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> or the desired Land, for that at the first discovery of the <hi>India's</hi> it was the first Land the <hi>Spaniards</hi> found, being then as desirous to find some Land after many dayes sailing as wee were. After this Island presently we discovered another called <hi>Marigalante,</hi> then another called <hi>Dominica,</hi> and lastly, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther named <hi>Guadalupe,</hi> which was that wee aimed at to refesh our selves in, to wash our foule cloathes, and to take in fresh water, whereof wee stood in great need. By two or three of the clock in the afternoone wee came to a safe Rode lying before the Island, where wee cast our Anchors, no wayes fearfull of the naked Barbarians of that and the other Islands, who with great joy doe yearly expect the <hi>Spanish</hi> Fleets com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, and by the Moones doe reckon the Moneths, and thereby make their guesse at their comming, and prepare some their sugar Canes, others the Plantin, other the Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tois, some one Provision, some another to barter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with the <hi>Spaniards</hi> for their small Haberdash, or Iron, Knives, or such things which may help them in their Wars, which commonly they make against some other Islands. Before our Anchors was cast, out came the <hi>Indians</hi> to meet us in their Canoa's, round like Troughes, some whereof had beene painted by our <hi>English,</hi> some by the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> some by the <hi>French,</hi> at might appeare by their severall Armes, it being a common Rode and harbour to all Nations that saile to <hi>America.</hi>

Wee could not but much wonder at that sight never yet seene by us of people naked, with their haire hanging down to the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of their backes, with their faces cut out in severall fashions, or flowers, with thin plates hanging at their Noses, like Hog-rings, and fauning upon us like children, some speaking in their unknowne tongue, others using signs for such things as we ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined they desired. Their signe for some of our <hi>Spanish</hi> Wine was easily perceived, and their request most willingly granted to by our men, who with one reasonable Cup of <hi>Spanish</hi> Sacke presently tumbled up their heeles, and left them like swine tumbling on the Deck of our Ship. After a while that our people had sported with these rude and Savage <hi>Indians,</hi> our two Cock-Boates were ready to carry to shore such as either had clothes to wash, or a desire to bathe themselves in a River of fresh Water which is within the Island, or a mind to set their feet again upon unmoveable Land, after so many daies of uncertain footing in a floating and reeling Ship. But that day being farre spent, our Fryers resolved to stay in the Ship, and the next whole day to visit the Island; many of the Mariners and Passengers of all the Ships went that evening to shore, some returning at night, and some without feare continuing with the <hi>Indians</hi> all night on shore. The next morning my selfe and most of our Fryers went and having hired some <hi>Spaniards</hi> to wash our cloathes, we wandred sometimes all together sometimes two and two, and sometimes one alone about the Island, meeting with many <hi>Indians,</hi> who did us no hurt, but rather like children fauned upon us, offering us of their fruits, and begging of us whatsoever toies of pins, points or gloves they espied about us. Wee ventured to goe to some of their houses which stood by a pleasant River, and were by them kindly entertained, eating of their fish, and wild deeres flesh. About noone wee chanced to meet with some of the Jesuites of <hi>Santa Gertrudis</hi> Ship in the midst of the Mountain, who were very earnest in talke with a <hi>Mulatto,</hi> all naked like the rest of the <hi>Indians.</hi> This <hi>Mulatto</hi> was a Christian, born in <hi>Sevill</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> and had been slave there formerly to a rich Merchant, his name was <hi>Lewis,</hi> and spoke the <hi>Spanish</hi> Language very perfectly. Some twelve yeeres before, hee had run away from his Master by reason of hard and slavish usage, and having got to <hi>Cales,</hi> offering his service to a Gentleman then bound for <hi>America,</hi> the Gentleman fearing not that his true Master should ever have more notice of him from a new World, took him a Ship board with

In twelve yeares that hee had thus continued amongst them, hee had learned their language, was married to an <hi>Indian,</hi> by whom hee had three children living.

Then wee joyning with the Jesuites, began to perswade the poore Christian to forsake that heathenish life, wherein his soule could never bee saved, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mising him if hee would goe along with us, hee should bee free from slavery for ever. Poore Soule, though hee had lived twelve yeares without hearing a word of the true God, worshipping stockes and stones with the other Heathens; yet when hee heard a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain of Christ, of eternall damnation in hells torments, and of everlasting Salvation in Heavens joyes, hee began to weep, assuring us that hee would goe with us, were it not for his Wife and Children, whom hee tenderly loved, and could not forsake them. To this wee replyed, that hee might be a meanes of saving likewise their Souls, if hee would bring them with him; and further that wee would assure him that care should bee taken that neither hee, his Wife, nor children should ever want meanes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent for the maintenance of their lives. The <hi>Mulatto</hi> hearkned well to all this, though a suddaine feare surprized him, because certaine <hi>Indians</hi> passed by, and noted his long conference with us. The poore and timorous <hi>Mulatto</hi> then told us, that hee was in danger, for having been knowen by us, and that hee feared the <hi>Indians</hi> would kill him, and suspect that wee would steale him away; which if they did, and it were noised about the Island, wee should soone see their love changed into cruell rage and Mutiny. Wee perswaded him not to feare any thing they could doe to us, who had Souldiers, Gun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

So taking their leaves of us, they hastened to the Sea to informe the Admirall of what they had done, and to provide that the Cock-Boat of their Ship might bee in readinesse to receive <hi>Lewis,</hi> and his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily. Wee likewise returned to the shore to see if our Shirts, and Clothes were dry. Most of us (among whom my selfe was one) finding our Linnen ready and our Boat on shore went aboard to our Ship, leaving two or three of our company with many of other Ships on shore, especially the Jesuites waiting for their prey. When we came to our Ship, most of our Fryers with what love they had found in the Barbarians, were inflamed with a new zeale of staying in that Island, and converting those Heathens to Christianity, apprehending it an easie businesse (t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

zeale with great hazard of their lives, and many inconveniences were objected against so blind and simple an attempt. But those that were most zealous slighted all reasons, saying that the worst that could happen to them could bee but to be butchered, sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed and eaten up; and that for such a purpose they had come out of <hi>Spain</hi> to be crown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the Crowne of Martyrdome for confessing and preaching Jesus Christ. While wee were hot in this solemne consultation, behold an uproare on the shoare; our people running to and fro to save their lives, leaving their clothes, and hasting to the Cock-Boats, filling them so fast and so full, that some sunke with all the people in them; Above al,most pi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>iful and lamentable were the cries of some of our women, many casting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to the Sea, choosing rather to venture to be taken up by some Boat, or at worst to bee drowned, then to bee taken and to bee cruelly butchered by the <hi>Indians.</hi> Wee wondering at this suddain alteration, not knowing the cause of it, at last perceived the Arrowes to come out thick from the Wood from behind the Trees, and thereby guessed at the truth that the Barbarians were mutinied. The uproare lasted not halfe an houre, for presently our Admirall shot off two or three Peeces of Ordnance and sent a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of Souldiers to shore to guard it and our people with their Muskets; which was well and suddainly performed, and all the <hi>Indians</hi> soon dispersed. Three of our Fry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers who had remained on the land, our Cock-Boat brought them to us with more of our Passengers, among whom one Fryer <hi>Iohn De la Cueva,</hi> was dangerously shot and wounded in one of his Shoulders; this Fryer had beene earnest with mee to stay on shore with him, which I refused, and so escaped that cruell and fiery onset of the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians.</hi> Besides those that were drowned and taken up at shore (which were fifteen per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons) two Jesuites were found dead upon the Sand, three more dangerously wounded, three passengers likewise slaine, ten wounded, besides three more of the Fleet which could never bee found alive or dead, and were thought to have beene found in the Wood by the <hi>Indians,</hi> and to have beene murthered by them. Our <hi>Mulatto Lewis</hi> came not according to his word; but in his stead a suddaine Army of treacherous <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians,</hi> which gave us motive enough to thinke, that either <hi>Lewis</hi> himselfe had disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered the Jesuites Plot to take him away with his Wife and Children; or that the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians</hi> suspecting it by his talke with us had made him confesse it. And certainly this was the ground of their Mutiny; for whereas <hi>L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </hi> before had said, that hee would know the Jesuites by their black Coats, it seemes hee had well described them above all the rest unto the <hi>Indians,</hi> for (as it was after well observed) most of their Arrowes was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to the black Markes, and so five of them in little above a quarter of an houre slaine and wounded. All that night our Souldiers guarded the Coast, often shooting off their Muskets, to affright the <hi>Indians,</hi> who appeared no more unto us. All that night wee slept little, for wee watched our Ship; lest the <hi>Indians</hi> in their Oanoa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Some lamented the dead and drowned, others pitied our wounded Fryer <hi>Iohn De la Cueva,</hi> who all that night lay in great torment and misery, others laughed and jeared at those zealous Fryers, who would have stayed in that Island to Convert the Barbarians, saying they had had their full desire of Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, for had they beene but that night with the <hi>Indians,</hi> doubtlesse they had beene shred for their Suppers. But now wee perceived their zeale was coole, and they defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red no more to stay with such a Barbarous kind of People; but rather wished the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall would shoot off the warning Peece for us all to take up our Anchors, and depart from so dangerous a place. In the morning all the Ships made hast to take in such fresh water as was necessary for their voiage yet to <hi>America,</hi> a strong watch being kept along the Coast, and a Guard guarding our men to the River; and all the morning while this was doing not one <hi>Indian</hi> could bee found or seen, nor our three men that were mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, appeared. Thus at noone with a pleasant and prosperous Gale we hoisted up our Sailes, leaving the Islands, and harbour of <hi>Guadalupe.</hi>

               <p>After foure dayes sail, our Fryer <hi>Iohn de la Cueva,</hi> who had been shot by the <hi>Indians,</hi> died; all his body being swelled, which gave us just occasion to thinke, that the arrow which was shot into his shoulder was poisoned. His buriall was as solemnly perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med as could be at Sea. His grave being the whole Ocean, he had weighty stones hung to his feet, two more to his shoulders, and one to his brest; and then the superstitious <hi>Romish Dirige</hi> and <hi>Requiem</hi> being sung for his soul, his Corpse being held out to the Sea on the ship side, with ropes ready to let him fall, all the ship crying out three times, <hi>buen Viaie</hi> (that is, a good Voiage) to his soul chiefly, and also to his Corpse ready to travail to the deep to feed the Whales: at the first cry all the Ordnance were shot off, the ropes on a suddain loosed, and <hi>Iohn de la Cueva</hi> with the weight of heavy stones plunged deep into the Sea, whom no mortall eyes ever more beheld. The like we saw perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in the ship of <hi>Santa Gertrudis,</hi> to another Jesuite, one of the three who had been dangerously wounded by the <hi>Indians</hi> of <hi>Guadalupe;</hi> who likewise died like our Fryer, his body being swelled as with poyson. Now our sailing was more comfortable then before; for we passed in the sight of the land of <hi>Puerto Rico,</hi> and then of the great Island of <hi>S<hi rend="sup">to.</hi> Domingo;</hi> and here our company began to be lessened, some departing to <hi>Puerto Rico,</hi> and <hi>S<hi rend="sup">to.</hi> Domingo,</hi> others to <hi>Cartagena,</hi> and <hi>Havana,</hi> and <hi>Honduras, Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maica,</hi> and <hi>Iucatan.</hi> We remained now alone the Fleet for <hi>Mexico;</hi> and so sailed till we came to what the <hi>Spaniards</hi> call <hi>la Sonda,</hi> or the sound of <hi>Mexico;</hi> for here we often soun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the Sea; which was so calme, that a whole week we were stayed for want of wind, scarce stirring from the place where first we were caught by the calme. Here likewise we had great sport in fishing, filling again our bellies with <hi>Dorados,</hi> and saving that provision which we had brought from <hi>Spain.</hi> But the heat was so extraordinary, that the day was no pleasure unto us; for the repercussion of the suns heat upon the still water and pitch of our ships, kindled a scorching fire, which all the day distempered our bodies with a constant running sweat, forcing us to cast off most of our clothes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The evenings and nights were somewhat more comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, yet the heat which the sun had left in the pitched ribs and plankes of the ship was such, that under deck and in our Cabins wee were not able to sleep, but in our shirts were forced to walke, or sit, or lie upon the deck. The Mariners fell to washing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves and to swimming, till the infortunate death of one in the ship called <hi>St<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Francisco,</hi> made them suddainly leave off that sport.

Fork, and haling him with a Cable rope to the ship side, and then binding him with it, (being as much as a dozen or fifteen men could do to hoise him up into the ship) we found him to be a most monstrous creature, twelve els long at least, which we salted, and found likewise to eat like flesh, as hath been said of the <hi>Tortois.</hi> This kind is as rave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous after mans flesh as the <hi>Crocodile,</hi> and many of them were to be seen in this Sound of <hi>Mexico.</hi>

               <p>The <hi>Spaniards</hi> bathing themselves dayly by the ships side, (where there is no such danger of the <hi>Tiburon;</hi> who useth not to come too neere the ships) one Mariner of the ship called <hi>St. Francisco</hi> being more venturous then the rest, and offering to swimme from his ship, to see some friends in another not farre off, chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to be a most unfortunate prey to one of them, who before any boat could be set out to help him, was thrice seen to bee pulled under water by the Monster, who had devoured a leg, an arme, and part of his shoulder; the rest of the body was after found and taken up, and carried to <hi>S. Francisco,</hi> and there buried in the forme and manner as hath been said of our Fryer <hi>Iohn de la Cueva. They that goe downe to the sea in ships, these see the workes of the Lord, and his wonders in the deepe, Ps.</hi> 107. 23, 24. Here they shall see not only Whales, but other Fishes like Monsters mastering strong and valiant men, with severall sets of sharpe, strong and mighty teeth, devouring at one bit whole limmes with flesh and bones together. This mischance sadded all our Fleet for three daies till it pleased God to refresh our burning heat with a cool and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperous wind, driving us out of that calm Sound, which (if we had continued in it with that excessive heat) might have proved most unsound and unhealthy to our bodies. Three daies after we had sailed, being Munday in the morning about seven of the clock, one of our Fryers saying Masse, and all the people in the ship kneeling to hear it, and to adore their bread God, one Mariner with a loud and suddain voice crieth out <hi>Tierra, Tierra, Tierra,</hi> Land, Land, Land, which rejoyced the hearts of all that were in the ship, as it seemed, more then their Masse, for leaving that, and their God upon the Altar with the Preist to eat him alone, they arose from their knees, to behold the Continent of <hi>America.</hi> Great was the joy of all the ships that day; and great was the slaughter which our old <hi>Calvo</hi> made among his fowles, (which he had spared <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

But our wise Admirall knowing the danger of the Coast, and especially the dangerous entring into the Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, by reason of the many rockes that lie about it, and are known only by markes aod flags set out to give all ships warning of them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> perceiving that with the wind wherewith wee sailed then, we should not come till towards evening to the Port: and last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, fearing lest some North-wind (which is dangerous upon that Coast, and ordinary in the month of <hi>September</hi>) should in the night arise, and endanger all our ships upon the rockes; he therefore called to Councell all the Pilots, to know whether it were best to keep on our sailing with full sail that day, with hopes to get that day in good time in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Haven, or else with the middle sail only to draw neer, that the next morning with more security wee might with the help of boats from land be guided in. The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult of the Councell was not to venture that day too neer unto the Port, for fear of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing benighted, but to pull down all, but the middle sail. The wind began to calme, and our ships to move slowly towards land, and so we continued till night.

Our Mariners came to the Fryers, using almost the same words of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Their feare was more for the apprehension of danger by that kind of wind, and of what might happen, then for what as yet the wind threatned, which was not strong nor boisterous; however hallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed wax candles were lighted by the Fryers, knees bowed to <hi>Mary,</hi> Letanies and other hymnes and prayers sung aloud unto her, till towards the dawning of the day; when behold the North wind ceased, our wonted gale began to blow again, it being Gods will and pleasure, and no effect of the howling Fryers prayers to <hi>Mary,</hi> who yet super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitioufly

Our Waits plaied most pleasantly, our Ordnance saluted both Towne and Fort over against it, our hearts and countenances reciprocally rejoyced; wee cast our Anchors, which yet were not enough to secure our ships in that most dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Haven, but further with Cable ropes we secured them to Iron rings, which for that purpose are fastned into the Wall of the Fort, for feare of the strong and boiste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Northerne winds.

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">V</seg>Pon the 12 day of <hi>September,</hi> we happily arrived in <hi>America</hi> in that famous Towne, called <hi>St. Iohn de Ulhua,</hi> otherwise <hi>Vera Crux;</hi> famous for that it was the first beginning of the famous conquest of that valiant and ever renowned Conquer or <hi>Hernando Cortez.</hi> Here first was that noble and generous reso'ution, that never heard of policy, to sinke the ships, which had brought the first <hi>Spaniards</hi> to that Continent, greater then any of the other three parts of the world, to the intent that they might thinke of nothing but such a conquest as after followed, being destitute of the helpe of their ships, and without hopes evermore to returne to <hi>Cuba, Yucatan,</hi> or any of those parts from whence they had come. Here it was, that the first five hundred <hi>Spaniards</hi> strengthned themselves against millions of enemies, and against the biggest fourth part of all the world. Here were the first Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates, Judges, Aldermen, Officers of Justice named. The proper name of the Towne is <hi>S. Iohn de Ulhua,</hi> otherwise called <hi>Vera Crux,</hi> from the old Harbour and Haven of <hi>Vera Crux,</hi> six leagues from this, and so called for that upon good Friday It was first discovered. But the old <hi>Vera Crux</hi> proving too dangerous an Harbour for ships, by reason of the violence of the Northern winds; it was utterly forsaken by the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who removed to <hi>St. Iohn De Ulhua,</hi> where their ships found the first safe road by reason of a Rocke, which is a strong defence against the winds. And because the memory of the worke of that good Friday should never be forgotten; to <hi>S. Iohn de Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hua</hi> they have added the name also of <hi>Vera Crux,</hi> taken from that first Haven which was discovered upon good Friday, <hi>Anno</hi> 1519.</p>
               <p>As soone as we came to shore, wee found very solemne preparations for entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, all the Towne being resorted to the Sea side, all the Preists and Canons of the Cathedrall Church, all the religious Orders of the severall Convents (which are there Dominicans, Franciscans, Mercenarians, and Jesuites) being in a readinesse with their Crosses borne before them, to guide the new Viceroy of <hi>Mexico,</hi> in processi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the chiefe Cathedrall Church. The Fryers and Jesuites were quicker in going to land then the great <hi>Don</hi> the Marquesse <hi>de Serralvo</hi> and his Lady. Some of them kissed the ground as holy in their opinion, for the Conversion of those <hi>Indians</hi> to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity, who before had worshipped Idols, and sacrificed to Devils; others kneeled upon their knees making short prayers, some to the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> others to such Saints as they best affected; and so betooke themselves to the places and stations of those of their profession. In the mean time all the Cannon playing both from ships and Castle, landed the Viceroy and his Lady and all his Traine, accompanyed with <hi>Don Martin de Carrillo</hi> the Visiter generall for the strife between the Count of <hi>Gelves</hi> the last Viceroy, &amp; the Archbishop of <hi>Mexico.</hi> The great Don and his Lady being placed under a Canope of state, began the <hi>Te Deum</hi> to be sung with much variety of musicall instruments, all mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching in procession to the Cathedrall, where with many lights of burning lampes, tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, &amp; Wax candles, was to the view of all, set upon the high Altar their God of bread; to whom all knees were bowed, a prayer of thanks-giving sung, holy water by a Preist

sprinkled upon all the people, and lastly a Masse with three preists solemnly celebrated. This being ended the Viceroy was attended on by the Chief High Justice, named <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>lde</hi> Major by the Officers of the Town, some Judges sent from <hi>Mexico</hi> to that purpose, and all the Souldiers of the Ships and Town unto his lodging; The Fryers likewise in Procession with their Crosse before them were conducted to their severall Cloisters. Fryer <hi>Calvo</hi> presented his Dominicans to the Prior of the Cloister of St. <hi>Dominicke,</hi> who entertained us very lovingly with some sweet Meates, and every one with a Cup of the <hi>Indian</hi> drink called <hi>Chocolatte,</hi> whereof I shall speake hereafter. This refreshment being ended, wee proceeded to a better, which was a most stately Dinner both of Fish and Flesh; no Fowles were spared, many Capons, Turky Cocks, and Hens were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digally lavished, to shew us the abundance and plenty of Provision of that Country. The Prior of this Cloister was no stayed, ancient, grey-headed man, such as usually are made Superiours to govern young and wanton Fryers; but hee was Gallant and Amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous young Sparke, who (as wee were there informed) had obtained from his Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our the Provinciall the Government of that Convent with a Bribe of a thousand Duc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kats. After dinner hee had some of us to his Chamber, where wee observed his light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and little savour of Religion or Mortification in him; We thought to have found in his Chamber some stately Library, which might tel us of Learning and love of Study; but we found not above a dozen old Bookes, standing in a corner covered with dust and Cobwebs, as if they were ashamed that the Treasure that lay hid in them, should be so much forgotten, and undervalued, and the Guitarra (the <hi>Spanish</hi> Lute) preferred and set above them. His Chamber was richly dressed and hung with many pictures, and with hangings, some made with Cotten Wooll, others with various coloured feathers of <hi>Mechoacan,</hi> his Tables covered with Carpets of Silk; his Cubboards adorned with severall sorts of <hi>China</hi> Cups and Dishes, stored within with severall dainties of sweet Meates and Conserves.</p>
               <p>This sight seemed to the zealous Fryers of our Mission most vaine, and unbeseeming a poore and mendicant Fryer; to the others, whose end in comming from <hi>Spain</hi> to those parts was Liberty, and loosnesse, and covetousnesse of riches, this sight was plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing and gave them great incouragement to enter further into that Country, where soone a Mendicant <hi>Lazarus</hi> might become a proud and wealthy <hi>Dives.</hi> The discourse of the young and light headed Prior was nothing but vaine boasting of himself, of his birth, his parts, his favour with the chiefe Superior or Provinciall, the love which the best Ladies, the richest Merchants Wives of the Towne bare unto him, of his cleere and excellent voice, and great dexterity in Musick, whereof he presently gave us a taste, tuning his <hi>Guitarra</hi> and singing to us some verses (as hee said, of his owne composing) some lovely <hi>Amaryllis,</hi> adding scandall to scandall, loosenesse to liberty, which it grieved some of us to see in a Superiour who should have taught with words, and in his life and Conversation examples of Repentance and Mortification. No soon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er were our senses of hearing delighted well with Musick, our sight with the objects of Cotten-Wool, Silke and Feather workes, but presently our Prior caused to be brought forth of all his store of dainties, such variety as might likewise relish well and delight our sense of tasting. Thus as wee were truely transported from <hi>Europe</hi> to <hi>America,</hi> so the World seemed truely to bee altered, our senses changed from what they were the night &amp; day before when we heard the hideous noise of the Mariners <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Here wee broke up our discourse and pastimes, desirous to walke abroad and take a view of the Towne, having no more time then that, and the next day to stay in it. Wee compassed it round about that afternoone; and found the situation of it to bee sandy, except on the South-West side, where it is Moorish ground, and full of standing Bogs, which with the great heates that are there, cause it to bee a very unhealthy place; The number of Inhabitants may bee three thousand, and amongst them some very rich Merchants, some worth two hundred, some three hundred, and some foure hundred thousand Duckats. Of the buildings little we observed, for they are all, both Houses, Churches, and Cloisters built with Boards and Timber, the Walls of the richest mans house being made but of boards, which with the impetuous Winds

The unhealthinesse of the place is the reason of the paucity of Inhabitants, and the paucity of them, together with the rich Trading and commerce, the reasons that the Merchants therein are extraordinary rich; who yet might have been farre richer, had not the Town been so often fired, and they in th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

All the strength of this Towne is first the hard and dangerous en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance into the Haven; and secondly, a rock which lyeth before the Town lesse then a Musket shot off; upon which is built a Castle, and in the Castle a slight Garrison of Souldiers. In the Town there is neither Fort, nor Castle, nor scarce any people of warlike mindes. The Rocke and Castle are as a Wall, defence, and inclosure to the Haven, which otherwise lyeth wide open to the Ocean, and to the Northern Winds. No Ship dares cast anchor within the Haven, but onely under the Rock and Castle, and yet not sure enough so with Anchors, except with Cables also they be bound and fastened to Rings of Iron for that purpose to the side of the Rock; from whence some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it hath happened that Ships floating with the Stream too much on one side the Rocke have been driven off and cast upon the other Rockes or out to the Ocean, the Cables of their Anchors, and those wherewith they have beene fastned to the Castle being broken with the force of the Winds. This happened to one of our Ships the first night after we landed; who were happy that we were not then at Sea; for there arose such a storme and Tempest from the North, that it quite broke the Cables of one Ship and drove it out to the maine Sea, and wee thought it would have blowne and droven us out of our beds after it, for the slight boarded houses did so totter &amp; shake, that we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected every houre when they would fal upon our heads. We had that first night enough of St. <hi>Iohn de Ulhua,</hi> and little rest, though feasted as well at Supper as at Dinner by our vaine boasting Prior, who before wee went to bed, had caused all our feet to bee washed, that now in easier beds then for above two moneths together the strait and narrow Cabins of the Ship had allowed us, our sleep might be more quiet, and more nourishing to our bodies; but the whistling Winds and tottering Chambers, which made our Beds uneasie Cradles to us, caused us to flie from our rest at midnight, and with our bare (though washed) feet to seeke the dirty Yard for safer shelter. In the morning the Fryers of the Cloister who were acquainted with those winds and storms, laughed at our fearefulnesse, assuring us, that they never slept better then when their Beds were rocked with such like blasts. But that nights affrightment made us weary already of our good and kind entertainment; wee desired to remo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Thirty Mules were ready for us, which had bin brought a purpose from <hi>Mexico,</hi> and had waited for us in St. <hi>Iohn de Ulhua</hi> six days before ever the Fleet arrived. <hi>Calvo</hi> that day busied himselfe a Ship board in sending to shore our Chests, and such Provision as had been left of Wines, and Bisket, Gammons of Bacon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and salted Beefe, whereof there was some store, besides a dozen Hens and three Sheep, which was much wondred at, that so much should be left after so long a voiage. In the mean time we visited our friends and tooke our leaves of them in the forenoone; and after Dinner seats were prepared for us in the Cathedrall Church to sit and see a Comedy acted, which had beene on purpose studied and prepared by the Town for the entertainment of the new Viceroy of <hi>Mexico.</hi> Thus two daies onely we abode in St. <hi>Iohn de Ulhua,</hi> and so departed.</p>

Iohn de Ulhua</hi> had writ a letter unto them the day before of our passing that way, charging them to meet us in the way, and to welcome us into those parts; which was by the poor <hi>Indians</hi> gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantly performed; for two miles before we came to the Towne, there met us on Horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back some twenty of the chiefe of the Towne, presenting unto every one of us a nose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gay of flowers; who rid before us a bow shot, till we met with more company on foot, to wit, the Trumpeters, the Waits; (who sounded pleasantly all the way be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us) the Officers of the Church, such as here we call Church-wardens, though more in number, according to the many sodalities or confraternities of Saints whom they serve, these likewise presented to each of us a nosegay; next met us the singing men and boyes, all the Quiristers, who softly and leisurely walked before us singing, <hi>Te Deum laudamus,</hi> till we came to the midst of the Towne, where were two great Elmetrees, the chiefe Market place; there was set up one long arbour with green bowes, and a table ready furnished with boxes of conserves, and other sweat meates, and diet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bread, to prepare our stomacks for a cup of <hi>Chocolatte,</hi> which while it was seasoning with the hot water and Sugar, the chiefe <hi>Indians</hi> and Officers of the Towne made a speech unto us, having first kneeled downe and kissed our hands one by one; they wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comed us into their Countrey, calling us the Apostles of Jesus Christ, thanked us for that we had left our own Countrey, our friends, our fathers a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

We refreshed ourselves for the space of one hour, and gave hearty thanks to the <hi>Indians</hi> for their kind respects unto us, assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring them that nothing was more deare unto us in this world then their souls, which that we might save, wee regarded not sea, nor land dangers, nor the unhumane cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elties of barbarous and savage <hi>Indians,</hi> (who as yet had no knowledge of the true God) no nor our owne lives.</p>
               <p>And thus we took our leaves, giving unto the chief of them some Beads, some medals, some Crosses of brasse, some <hi>Agnus Dei,</hi> some reliques brought from <hi>Spain,</hi> and to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one of the Town an Indulgence of fourty years, (which the Pope had granted unto us, to bestow where and upon whom, and as often as wee would) where with we began to blind that simple people with ignorant, erroneous, and Popish principles. As we went out of arbour to take our Mules, behold the Market place was full of <hi>Indian</hi> men and women; who as they saw us ready to depart, kneeled upon the ground as adoring us for a blessing, which as we rid along, we bestowed upon them with lifted up hands on high, making over them the signe of the Crosse. And this submission of the poor <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians</hi> unto the Preists in those parts; this vain-glory in admitting such ceremonious entertainment and publike worship from them, did so puffe up some of our young Fry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers hearts, that already they thought themselves better then the best Bishops in <hi>Spain,</hi> who though proud enough, yet never travail there with such publike acclamations as we did. The Waits and Trumpets sounded againe before us, and the chiefe of the Town conducted us a mile forward, and so tooke their leaves. The first two daies we lodged but in poore small <hi>Indian</hi> Townes, among whom we still found kind entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and good store of provision, especially of Hens, Capons, Turkeys, and seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:53246:19"/>
sorts of fruits. The third day at night we came to a great Towne consisting of neere two thousand inhabitants, some <hi>Spaniards,</hi> some <hi>Indians,</hi> called <hi>Xalappa de la Vera Crux.</hi> This Towne in the yeare 1634. was made a new Bishops Sea (the Bisho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prick of the City, called <hi>La Puebla de los Angeles</hi> being divided into two) and this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not above the third part of it, is thought to be worth ten thousand duckats a yeer. It stands in a very fertile soile for <hi>Indian</hi> wheat called <hi>Maiz,</hi> and some <hi>Spanish</hi> wheat. There are many Townes about it of <hi>Indians;</hi> but what makes it rich, are the many farmes of Sugar, and some which they call <hi>Estantia's,</hi> rich farmes for breeding of Mules, and cattell; and likewise some Farmes of <hi>Cochinil.</hi> In this Towne there is but one great Church and an inferiour Chappell, both belonging to a Cloister of Franciscan Friers, wherein we were lodged that night and the next day, being the Lords day. Though the revenues of this Cloister be great, yet it maintaines not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove halfe a dozen Fryers, where twenty might be plentifully maintained, that so those few lubbers might be more abundantly, and like Epicures fed and nourished. The Superiour or Guardian of this Cloister was no lesse vaine then the Prior of <hi>S. Iohn de Ulbua;</hi> and though he were not of our profession, yet he welcomed us with stately entertainment. Here and wheresoever further we travailed, we still found in the Preists and Fryers loosenesse of life, and their waies and proceedings contrary to the waies of their profession, sworne to by a solemne Vow and Covenant. This Order especially of the mendicant Franciscan Fryers voweth (besides chastity and obedience) poverty more strictly to be observed, then any other Order of the <hi>Romish</hi> Church; for their Clothing ought to be corse sackcloth, their girdles made of hemp should be no finer then strong halters, their shirts should be but woollen, their legs should know no stockings, their feet no shoes, but at the most and best either wooden clogs, or sandals of hemp, their hands and fingers should not so much as touch any money, nor they have the use or possession or propriety of any, nor their journeys be made easy with the help of Horses to carry them, but painfully they ought to travaile on foot; and the breach of any of these they acknowledge to be a deadly and mortall sinne, with the guilt of a high soul-damning and soul-cursing excommunication. Yet for all these bonds and obligations, those wretched Impes live in those parts as though they had never vowed unto the Lord, shewing in their lives that they have vowed what they are not able to performe. It was to us a strange and scandalous sight to see here in <hi>Xalappa</hi> a Fryer of the Cloister riding in with his lackey boy by his side, upon a goodly gelding, (having gone but to the Townes end, as we were informed, to heare a dying mans confession) with his long habit tucked up to his girdle, making shew of a fine silke orange colour stockin upon his legs, and a neate Cordovan shoe upon his foot, with a fine Holland paire of drawers, with a lace three inches broad at knee. This sight made us willing to pry further into this and the other Fryers carriages, under whose broad sleeves we could perceive their dublets quilted with silke, and at their wrists the laces of their Holland shirts. In their talke we could discerne no mortification, but meer vanity and wordlinesse. After supper some of them began to talk of carding and dicing; they challenged us, that were but new comers to those parts, to a Primera; which though most of ours refused, some for want of money, some for ignorance of that game, yet at last with much ado they got two of our Fryers to joyn with two of theirs; so the cards were handsomely shuffled, the vies and revies were doubled, losse made some hot &amp; blind with passion, gain made others eager and covetous; and thus was that religious Cloister made all night a gaming house, and sworne religious poverty turned into pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane and worldly covetousnesse. We that beheld some part of the night the game, found enough to observe, for the more the sport increased, scandalls to the sport were added, both by drinking and swearing that common oath <hi>Voto a Christo, Voto a Dios,</hi> and also by scoffing and jearing at the religious vowes of poverty which they had vowed; for one of the Franciscans though formerly he had touched money, and with his fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers had laid it to the stake on the table; yet sometimes to make the company laugh, if he had chanced to winne a double vie (and sometimes the vies and revies went round of twenty patacons) then would he take the end of one sleeve of his habit, and open wide the other broad sleeve, and so with his sleeve sweep the money into his other sleeve, saying, I have vowed not to touch money, nor to keep any, I meaned then a naturall contact of it; but my sleeve may touch it, and my sleeve may keep it: shewing with scoffes and jests of his lips, what religion was in his heart. My eares tingled with
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:53246:19"/>
hearing such oathes, my tongue would have uttered some words of reproofe, but that I considered my self a guest and stranger in a strange house, and that if any thing I should say, it would doe no good; so silently I departed to my rest, leaving the Gamesters, who continued til Sun-rising, and in the morning I was informed that the jesting Fryer, that rather roaring Boy then religious Franciscan, fitter for <hi>Sardanapalus</hi> or <hi>Epicurus</hi> his Schoole, then to live in a Cloister, had lost fourescore and odde Patacons, his sleeve (it seemes) refusing to keep for him what hee had vowed never to possesse. Here I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to find out by experience of these Franciscans, that liberty and loosnesse of life it was that brought yeerly so many Fryers and Jesuites from <hi>Spain</hi> to those parts, rather then zeale of Preaching the Gospel and Converting Soules to Christ, which indeed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an act of highest Charity, they make a speciall badge of the truth of their Religion: But the loosnesse of their lives sheweth evidently that the love of money, of vain-glory, of Power and Authority over the poore <hi>Indians,</hi> is their end and aime more then any love of God. From <hi>Xalappa</hi> we went to a place called by the <hi>Spaniards, La Rinconada,</hi> which is no Towne nor Village, and therefore not worth mentioning in such a Rode as now I am in; yet as famous in two things, it must not bee omitted amongst greater places. This place stands so far from any other Town, that Travellers can scarce make their journeys without either baiting there at noone, or lying there at night, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining three or foure miles out of the Rode to some <hi>Indian</hi> Town. It is no more then one house, which the <hi>Spaniards</hi> call, <hi>Venta,</hi> or as our <hi>English,</hi> Innes, seated in the corner of a low Valley, which is the hottest place from St. <hi>Iohn de Ulhua</hi> to <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>xico;</hi> about it are the best Springs and Fountaines in all the Rode, and the water though warme with the heat of the Sun, yet as sweet as any Milk. The Inne-keeper knowing wel the <hi>Spaniards</hi> heat, that it seeks coole and refreshing drink, have speciall care so to lay in water in great earthen Vessels, which they set upon a moist and waterish Sand, that it is so cold that it maketh the teeth to chatter. This sweetnesse and this coolnesse together of that water in so hot and scorching a Countrey, was to us a wonder, who could find no other refresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from that extraordinary heat. Besides our Provision here of Beefe, Mutton, Kid, Hens, Turkeys, Rabbets, Fowles, and especially Quailes, was so plentifull and cheape, that wee were astonished at it. The Valley and Countrey about it is very rich and fertile, full of <hi>Spanish</hi> Farmes of Sugar, and <hi>Cochinil, Spanish</hi> and <hi>Indian</hi> Wheate. But what maketh mee more especially remember this <hi>Venta,</hi> or Inne, is, for that though Art and experience of man have found a way to provide for Travellers in so hot a place coole and refreshing water, and God have given it the sweetnesse of Milk, and to the place such abundance of Provision; yet all this in the day onely is comfortable and pleasant; but in the night the <hi>Spaniards</hi> call it, <hi>Cumfites en infierno,</hi> that is to say, Cumfits in hell, for not onely the heat is so extraordinary, that it is impossible to bee feeding without wiping away the continuall sweat of the Face, whose drops from the Browes are alwayes ready to blind our eyes and to fill with sauce our dishes, but the swarmes of Gnats are such that waking and sleeping no device of man is able to keep them off. True it is, most of us had our Pavilions which wee carried (with us to hang about and over our beds, but these could not defend us from that piercing and stinging Vermine, which like <hi>Egypts</hi> Plague of Frogs would be sure to be in every place, and through our Curtaines to come upon our very Beds. Yet in the day they are not; but just at Sun setting they begin to swarme about, and at Sun rising away they goe. After a most tedious and troublesome night, when wee found the rising of the Sun had dispersed and banished them away, wee thought it best for us to flie away from that place with them; and so from thence earely wee departed to a Towne as pleasant and fertill and abounding with Provision as this <hi>Rinconada,</hi> and free from such busie guests and individuall Mates and Companions as the night before had intruded them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves upon us. The next night wee got to a Towne called <hi>Segura,</hi> inhabited both by <hi>Indians</hi> and <hi>Spaniards,</hi> consisting of about a thousand Inhabitants; here again without any charges we were stately entertained by Franciscan Fryers, as light and vain glorious as those of <hi>Xalappa.</hi> This Town had its first beginning and foundation from <hi>Hernando Cortez,</hi> and is called <hi>Segura de la Frontera,</hi> being built up by him for a Frontier Town to secure the <hi>Spaniards</hi> that came from St. <hi>Iohn de Ulhu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="28" facs="tcp:53246:20"/>
beene dangerously wounded, and were retired to <hi>Tlaxcallan</hi> to recover and strengthen themselves; the two Townes, <hi>Culhua</hi> and <hi>Tepeacac,</hi> then in League with the <hi>Mexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans</hi> against <hi>Cortez</hi> and the Town of <hi>Tlaxcallan,</hi> lying in wait for the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> took twelve of them, and sacrificed them alive to their Idols and eat their flesh. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon <hi>Cortez</hi> desired <hi>Maxixca,</hi> a chief Captain of <hi>Tlaxcallan,</hi> and divers other Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen of that Towne to goe with him and to help him to bee avenged of the people of <hi>Tepeacac</hi> for the cruelty used to twelve of his <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and for the daily and great hurt they also did to the Inhabitants of <hi>Tlaxcallan</hi> with the helpe of their allied friends the <hi>Culhuacant</hi> and <hi>Mexicans. Maxixca</hi> and the chief of <hi>Tlaxcallan</hi> forthwith entred into counsell with the States and and Communalty of the Town, and there determined with generall consent to give unto him forty Thousand fighting Men, besides many <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memez,</hi> who are Foot Carriers, to be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>re the Baggage, Victuall, and other things. With this number of <hi>Tlaxcalteca's,</hi> his owne men, and horses, <hi>Cortez</hi> went to <hi>Tepeacac,</hi> requiring them in satisfaction of the death of the twelve Christians, that they should now yeeld themselves to the obedience of the Emperour and King of <hi>Spain</hi> his Master, and hereafter never more to receive any <hi>Mexican</hi> into their Town or houses, neither yet any of the Province of <hi>Culhua.</hi> The <hi>Tepeacacs</hi> answered that they had slain the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi> for good and just cause, which was that being time of Warre, they presumed to passe through their Countrey by force without their will and License. And also that the <hi>Mexicans</hi> and <hi>Culhuacans</hi> were their friends and Lords, whom alwayes they would friendly entertaine within their Towne and houses, refusing utterly their offer and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest, protesting to give no obedience to whom they knew not, wishing them there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to return incontinent to <hi>Tlaxtallan,</hi> except they had desire to end their weary days, and to be sacrificed and eaten up as their twelve friends had been. <hi>Cortez</hi> yet invited them many times with peace; and seeing it prevailed not, he began his Wars in earnest. The <hi>Tepeacacs</hi> with the favour of the <hi>Culhuacans</hi> were brave and lusty, and began to stop and defend the <hi>Spaniards</hi> entrance into their Town. And being many in number with divers valiant men among them, began to skirmish sundry times; but at the end they were overthrown and many slain without killing any <hi>Spaniard,</hi> although many <hi>Tlaxcalteca's</hi> were killed that day. The Lords and principall Persons of <hi>Tepeacac</hi> see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their overthrow, and that their strength could not prevaile, yeelded themselves unto <hi>Cortez</hi> for Vassals of the Emperour with condition to banish for ever their allied friends of <hi>Culhua;</hi> and that hee should punish and correct at his will and pleasure all those which were occasion of the death of the twelve <hi>Spaniards.</hi> For which causes and obstinacy, at the first <hi>Cortez</hi> judged by his sentence that all the Townes which had been privy to the murther, should for ever remain Captives and slaves; others affirm that he overcame them without any condition, and corrected them for their disobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, being Sodomites, Idolaters and eaters of mans flesh, and chiefly for example of all others. And in conclusion, they were condemned for slaves, and within twenty daies that these Wars lasted, hee pacified all that Province, which is very great, hee drave from thence the <hi>Culhuacans,</hi> hee threw down the Idols, and the chiefest persons obeyed him. And for more assurance he built there this Town, naming it <hi>Segura De la Frontera,</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing all Officers for the purpose, whereby the Christians and strangers might passe without danger from <hi>Vera Crux</hi> to <hi>Mexico.</hi> This Town likewise, as all the rest from St. <hi>Iohn de Ulhua</hi> to <hi>Mexico,</hi> is very plentifull of provision, and many sorts of fruits, namely Plantins, <hi>Sapots,</hi> and <hi>Chicosapots,</hi> which have within a great black kernell as big as our horse Pl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </p>
               <p>Whereupon hee dispatched unto them foure <hi>Indians</hi> of a Towne called <hi>Zempoallan,</hi> as Ambassadours to acquaint them of his coming into those parts, and of his desire to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sit their Towne, not for any harme he intended to them, but rather for their good<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The <hi>Tlaxcalteca's</hi> fearing <hi>Cortez,</hi> and judging him a friend of <hi>Montezuma,</hi> because upon his way to visit him, and having heard of the many costly presents which the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour had sent unto him; they resolved to resist his coming, and to send him no answer to his ambassage; but tooke the four Messengers which he had sent, and imprisoned them, minding to sacrifice them unto their Gods as Espies. <hi>Cortez</hi> seeing the long tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying of the Messengers, departed from <hi>Zaclotan,</hi> without any intelligence from <hi>Tlax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>callan.</hi> His camp had not marched much after their departure from that place, but they came to a great circuit of stone made without lime or morter, being of a fadome and a halfe high, and twenty foot broad, with loupe holes to shoot at; this wall cros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed over a whole valley, from one mountain to another, and but one only entrance or gate, in the which the one wall doubled against the other, and the way there was fourty paces broad, in such sort that it was an evil and perillous passage, if any had been there to defend it. <hi>Cortez</hi> demanded the cause of that circuit, and who had built it; the <hi>Indians</hi> that went with him, told him that it was but a division from their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey and <hi>Tlaxcallan,</hi> and that their Antecessors had made the same to disturbe the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance of the <hi>Tlazcalteca's</hi> in time of warre, who came to rob and murther them because of the friendship betwixt them and <hi>Montezuma,</hi> whose vassals they were. That strange and costly wall seemed a thing of great majesty to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and more superfluous then profitable, yet they suspected that the <hi>Tlaxcalteca's</hi> were valiant warriers, who had such defence made against them. But <hi>Cortez</hi> setting all fear aside, with three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Souldiers on a ranke, entred the way in the wall, and proceeded in good order all the way forwards, carrying the Ordnance ready charged, and he himselfe the Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of all his Army, and sometimes he would be halfe a league before them, to discover and make the way plain. And having gone the space of three leagues from that circuit, he commanded his Foot-men to make haste, because it was somewhat late, and he with his Horse-men went to descry the way forwards, who ascending up a hill, two of the formost Horse-men met with fifteen <hi>Indians</hi> armed with swords, and targets, and tuffes of feathers, which they used to weare in the warres. These fifteen being Spies, when they saw the Horse-men, began to flie with fear, or else to give advice. But <hi>Cortez</hi> approaching with other three Horsemen called to them to stay; which they by no means would hearken unto; till six more Horse-men ran after them, and overtooke them. The <hi>Indians</hi> then joyning all together with determination rather to die then to yeeld, shewed to the <hi>Spaniards</hi> signes to stand still. But the Horsemen coming to
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:53246:21"/>
lay hands on them; they prepared themselves to battel, and fought, defending themselves for a while. In this fight the <hi>Indians</hi> slew two of their Horses, and (as the <hi>Spaniards</hi> do witnesse) at two blowes they cut off a Horse head, bridle and all. Then came the rest of the Horsemen, the Army also of the <hi>Indians</hi> approached, for there were in sight neer five thousand of them in good order, to succour their fifteen fighting men; but they came too late for that purpose, for they were all slain by the <hi>Spanish</hi> fury, because they would not render themselves in time, and had killed two of their Horses. Yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding their fellowes fought, until they espied the <hi>Spanish</hi> Army coming, and the Ordnance, then they returned leaving the field to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> whose Horse-men fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed them, and slew about seventy of them, without receiving any hurt. With this the <hi>Indians</hi> perceiving the great advantage which the <hi>Spaniards</hi> had against them with their Horses, and meaning to come upon them subtilly with a more powerful Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, that they might the better deceive and delude them, they sent unto <hi>Cortez</hi> two of the four Messengers which had been sent unto them with other <hi>Indians,</hi> saying, that they of <hi>Tlaxcallan</hi> knew nothing of the things that had happened, certifying likewise that those with whom he had fought, were of other communities, and not of their juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, being sorrowfull for that which had passed; and for so much as it happened in their countrey, they would willingly pay for the two Horses which were slain, pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to come in good time to their Towne, who would gladly receive them, and enter into their league of friendship, because they seemed to bee valiant men; But all this was a feigned and a false message. Yet <hi>Cortez</hi> beleeved them, and gave them thanks for their courtesie and good will; and that according to their request he would goe unto their Towne, and accept their friendship. And touching the death of his Horses, hee required nothing, for that within short time he expected many more; yet sorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full he was not so much for the want of them, as that the <hi>Indians</hi> should thinke that Horses could die or be slain. <hi>Cortez</hi> proceeded forwards about two leagues, where the Horses were killed, although it was almost sun set, and his men wearied, having travelled far that day. He planted his Army by a river side, remaining all that night with good watch both of Foot-men and Horse-men, fearing some assault; but there was no at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt given that night. The next morning at sun rising, <hi>Cortez</hi> departed with his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my in good order, and in the midst of them went the Fardage and Artillerie, and after a little marching they met with the other two Messengers whom they had sent from <hi>Zaclotan;</hi> they came with pitifull cryes exclaiming of the Captaines of the power of <hi>Tlaxoallan,</hi> who had bound them and detained them from returning; but with good fortune that night they had broken loose, and escaped, for otherwise in the morning following they had been sacrificed to the God of Victory, and after the sacrifice they had been eaten for a good beginning of the warres; the <hi>Tlaxcalteca's</hi> protesting to doe the like to the bearded men (for so they termed the <hi>Spaniards</hi>) and to as many as came with them. They had no sooner told their tale, when there appeared behind a little hil about a thousand <hi>Indians,</hi> very well appointed after their fashion, and came with such a marvellous noise and cry, as though their voyces should have pierced the heavens; hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling at the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> stones, darts, and shot with bowes and arrowes. <hi>Cortez</hi> made many tokens of peace unto them, and by his Interpreters desired them to leave the battail. But so much the more as he intreated for peace, the more hasty and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest were they, thinking either to overcome them, or else to hold them play, to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> should follow them to a certaine ambush that was prepared for them, of more then fourescore thousand men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Here the <hi>Spaniards</hi> began to cease from words, and to lay hand upon their weapons; for that company of a thousand were as many as on the <hi>Spaniards</hi> side were fighting men; though they were well practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in the warres, very valiant, and also pitched in a better place for fight. This bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tail endured certaine houres, and at the end the <hi>Indians</hi> being either wearied, or else meaning to take the <hi>Spaniards</hi> in the snare appointed, began to flie towards the main battail, not as overcome, but to joyne with their own side. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> being hot in the fight and slaughter, which was not little, followed them with all their fardage, and unawares fell into the ambush, among an infinite number of <hi>Indians</hi> armed; they stayd not, because they would not put themselves out of order, and passed through their campe with great haste and fear. The <hi>Indians</hi> began to set upon the <hi>Spanish</hi> Horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, thinking to have taken their lances from them, their courage was so stout; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> had there perished, had it not been for their <hi>Indian</hi> friends, who
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:53246:21"/>
had come with them from <hi>Zempoallan</hi> and <hi>Zaclotan.</hi> Likewise the courage of <hi>Cortez</hi> did much animate them; for although hee led his Army making way, yet divers times hee turned him back to place his men in order, and to comfort them, and at length came out of that dangerous way and ambush, where the Horses might help, and the Ordnance stand in stead, which two things did greatly annoy the <hi>Indians</hi> to their great wonder and marvell, and at the sight thereof began to flie. In both incoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters remained many <hi>Indians</hi> slain and wounded, and of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> some were hurt, but none killed, who gave most hearty thankes unto God for their delivery from so great a multitude as were foure score thousand against one thousand onely of <hi>Indians</hi> and <hi>Spaniards</hi> joyned together. The <hi>Indians</hi> of <hi>Zempoallan</hi> and <hi>Zaclotan</hi> did play the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant men that day, wherefore <hi>Cortez</hi> honoured them with hearty thankes. Then they went to pitch their Campe in a village called <hi>Teoacazinco,</hi> where was a little Tower and a Temple, and there fortified themselves. The night following the <hi>Spaniards</hi> slept notquiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with fear of a third Invasion of the <hi>Tlaxcalteca's.</hi> As soone as it was day <hi>Cortez</hi> sent to the Captains of <hi>Tlaxcallan</hi> to require them of Peace and Friendship, willing them quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to suffer them to passe through their Countrey to <hi>Mexico,</hi> for that they meant them no hurt, but rather good wil. The answer of the captains of <hi>Tlaxcallan</hi> was, that the next day they would come and talke with him and declare their minds. <hi>Cortez</hi> was well pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared that night, for the answer liked him not, but rather seemed brave, and a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter determined to be done, as some had told him (whom hee tooke prisoners) who likewise certified that the <hi>Tlaxcalteca's</hi> were joyned together, to the number of a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and fifty thousand men to give battaile the next day following, and to swallow up alive the <hi>Spaniards</hi> whom so mortally they did hate, thinking them to bee friends unto the Emperour <hi>Montezuma,</hi> unto whom they wished all evill and mischief. Their intent was therefore with all their whole power to apprehend the bearded men, and to make of them a more solemne Sacrifice unto their Gods then at any time they had done, with a generall banquet of their flesh, which they called <hi>Celestiall.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Captaines of <hi>Tlaxcallan</hi> divided their Souldiers into foure Battailes, the one to <hi>Tepeticpac,</hi> another to <hi>Ocotelulco,</hi> the third to <hi>Tizatlan,</hi> and the fourth to <hi>Quiahuiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlan,</hi> that is to say, the men of the Mountaines, the men of the Limepits, the men of the Pinetrees, and the Water men; all these foure sorts of men did make the Body of the Common-weelth of <hi>Tlaxcallan,</hi> and commanded both in time of War and Peace. Every of these Captaines had his just portion or number of Warriers, but the Generall of all the whole Army was called <hi>Xicotencal,</hi> who was of the Limepits; and hee had the Standard of the Common-wealth, which is a Crane of gold with his wings spread, adorned with Emeralds and silver worke, which Standard was according to their use either carryed before the whole Host, or else behind them all. The Lieutenant Generall of the Army was <hi>Maxixcazin;</hi> and the number of the whole Army was a hundred and fifty Thousand men. Such a great number they had ready against foure hundred <hi>Spauiards,</hi> and seven hundred <hi>Indians</hi> of <hi>Zempoallam</hi> and <hi>Zaclotan,</hi> and yet at length overcome; and after this fight they were the greatest friends that <hi>Cortez</hi> had in those parts against <hi>Montezuma.</hi> These Captaines came with their Companies, that the fields where they were seemed a Forrest. They were gallant Fellowes and well Armed according to their use, although they were painted, so that their faces shewed like Devils, with great tuffes of Feathers, and they boasted gallantly. Their Weapons and Armour were Slings, Staves, Speares, Swords, Bowes and Arrowes, Sculles, Splintes, Gantlets, all of Wood, guilt or else covered with Feathers or Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; their Corselets were made of Cotten Wooll, their Targets and Bucklers gallant and strong, made of wood covered with leather and trimmed with lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, and feathers, their Swords were staves with an edge of flint stone cunningly joyned into the staffe, which would cut very well and make a sore wound. Their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments of War were hunters hornes, and Drummes called <hi>Ataballs</hi> made like a Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron and covered with Vellam. So that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> in all their discovery of <hi>India</hi> did never see a better Army together, nor better ordered; that which I could not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to speake of here, having come in the order of my history to <hi>Tlaxcallan,</hi> where this numerous and gallant <hi>Indian</hi> Army was set forth against 400 <hi>Spaniards</hi> and 600 <hi>Indians</hi> their friends. These <hi>Indians</hi> thus ordered in Battalia bragged very much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and said amongst themselves, What mad people are these beard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men that threaten us and yet know us not? But if they will bee so bold to invade
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:53246:22"/>
our Countrey without our licence, let us not set upon them so soone, it is meet they have a little rest, for wee have time enough to take and bind them; let us also send them meat, for they are come with empty stomackes, and so they shall not say that we do ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend them with wearinesse and hunger. Whereupon they sent unto the <hi>Spaniards</hi> three hundred Turkey cocks and two hundred baskets of bread, called <hi>Centli;</hi> the which present was a great succour and refreshment for the need the <hi>Spaniards</hi> stood in. And soone after, Now (say they) let us goe and set upon them, for by this time they have eaten their meat, and now we will eat them, and so shall they pay us the victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als that we sent. These &amp; such like brags they used, seeing so few <hi>Spaniards</hi> before them, and not knowing the strength of their Ordnance against their so numerous an host. Then the foure Captaines sent two thousand of their valiantest men of warre, and old Souldiers, to take the <hi>Spaniards</hi> quietly, with commandement that if they did resist, either to binde them, or else to kill them, meaning not to set their whole Army upon them, saying, that they should get but small honour for so great a multitude to fight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst so few. The two thousand Souldiers passed the trench that was betwixt the two campes, and came boldly to the Tower where the <hi>Spaniards</hi> were. Then came forth the Horse-men, and after them the Foot-men, and at the first encounter, they made the <hi>Indians</hi> feele how the iron swords would cut; at the second, they shewed of what force those few in number were, of whom a little before they had so jested<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but at the third brunt, they made those lusty Souldiers flie, who were come to apprehend them, for none of them escaped, but only a few such as knew the passage of the tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches or ditch. Then the main battail and whole Army set forth with a terrible and marvellous noise, and came so fierce upon the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> till they entred into their campe without any resistance, and there were at handy strokes with the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and in a good space could not get them out, many of them being killed, which were so bold to enter. In this sort they fought four houres, before they could make way among their enemies. Then the <hi>Indians</hi> began to faint, seeing so many dead on their side, and the great wounds they had, and that they could kill none of the Christians; yet the battail ceased not, till it drew neere night, and then they retired. Whereof <hi>Cortez</hi> and his Souldiers were exceeding glad, for they were fully wearied with killing of <hi>Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</hi> The next day in the morning <hi>Cortez</hi> went forth to runne the fields as he had done before, leaving halfe his men to keepe the campe; and because he should not be espied, he departed before day, and burned about ten Townes, and sacked one Towne, which was of three thousand houses, in the which were found but few people, because the most of them were gone to their campe. After the spoile he set fire on the Town, and came his way to his campe with a great prey by no one time. The <hi>Indians</hi> pursued thinking to take away their prey, and followed them into the camp, where they fought five houres, and could not kill one <hi>Spaniard,</hi> although many of their side were slain; for even as they were many, and stood on a throng together, the Ordnance made a wonderfull spoil among them, so that they left off fighting, and the victory remained for the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> whom the <hi>Indians</hi> thought were inchanted, because their arrowes could not hurt them. The next day following, the four Captaines sent three seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall things in present to <hi>Cortez,</hi> and the messengers that brought them said. Sir, behold here five slaves, and if thou be that rigoroue God that eatest mans flesh and blood, eat these which we bring unto thee, and we will bring thee more. And if thou be the gentle and meek God, behold here frankincense and feathers. And if thou bee a mortall man, take here fowle, bread and cherries. <hi>Cortez</hi> answered that both he and his were mortall men even as they were. And because that alwaies he had used to tell them truth, wherefore did they use to tell him lies, and likewise to flatter him, for he desired to be their friend, advising them not to be mad and stubborn in their opinion, for if they so did, assuredly they should receive great hurt and dammage.</p>
               <p>Notwithstanding this answer, there came againe about thirty thousand of them e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to <hi>Certez</hi> his campe, to prove their corslets, as they had done the day before, but they returned with broken pates. Here is to be noted that although the first day the whole host of <hi>Indians</hi> came to combat with the <hi>Spaniards<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> yet the next day they did not so, but every severall Captaine by himselfe, for to divide the better the travaile and paines equally among them; and because that one should not disturbe another through the multitude, considering that they should fight but with a few, and in a nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row place; and for this consideration their battails were more fresh and strong, for
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:53246:22"/>
each Captain did contend who should doe most valiantly for to get honour, and espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in killing one <hi>Spaniard,</hi> for they thought that all their hurts should be satisfied with the death of one <hi>Spaniard,</hi> or taking one prisoner. Likewise is to be considered the strangenesse of their battail, for notwithstanding their controversie fifteen daies that they were there, whether they fought or no, they sent unto the <hi>Spaniards</hi> cakes of bread, Turkey cocks and cherries. But this policy was not to give them that meat for good will, but onely to espie and see what hurt was done amongst them, and also to see what feare or stomack they had to proceed. But finding by their many spies that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> were nothing daunted nor diminished, they resolved to send unto <hi>Cortez Xicotencatl,</hi> who was chiefe and generall Captain in <hi>Tlaxcallan,</hi> and of all the warres; he brought in his company fifty persons of authority to keep him company. They ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached neer where <hi>Cortez</hi> was, and saluted each other according to the use of their countrey. Their salutations ended, and the parties being set downe; <hi>Xicotencatl</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan the talke, saying. Sir, I am come on mine owne behalfe and also of my fellow Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and Lievetenant <hi>Maxixca,</hi> and in the name of many other noble personages, and finally in the name of the whole State and Common-wealth of <hi>Tlaxcallan,</hi> to beseech and pray you to admit us into your friendship, and to yeeld our selves and countrey unto your King, craving also at your hand pardon for our attempt in taking up armes against you, wee not knowing what you were, nor what you sought for in our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey. And where we presumed to resist and defend your entrance, wee did it as against strangers whom we knew not, and such men as we had never heretofore seen; and fearing also that you had been friends to <hi>Montezuma,</hi> who is, and alwaies hath been our mortall enemy. And we had rather all in generall to end our lives, then to put our selves in subjection to him; for we thinke our selves as valiant men in courage as our fore-fathers were, who alwaies have resisted against him and his grand-father, who was as mighty as now is he. We would also have withstood you and your force, but we could not, although we proved all our possibility by night and day, and found your strength invincible, and we no lucke against you. Therefore since our fate is such, we had rather be subject unto you then unto any others; for wee have knowne and heard by the <hi>Zempoallanezes,</hi> that you doe no evill, nor came not to vexe any, but were most valiant and happy, as they have seen in the warres, being in your company. For which consideration, we trust that our liberty shall not be diminished, but rather our own persons, wives and families better preserved, and our houses and husbandry not destroyed. And in some of his talke, the tears trickling down his cheeks, he besought <hi>Cortez</hi> to weigh that <hi>Tlaxcallan</hi> did never at any time acknowlege any superiour Lord or King, nor at any time had come any person among them to command, but only he, whom now they did voluntarily elect and choose as their Superiour and Ruler. <hi>Cortez</hi> much rejoyced with this ambassage, and to see such a mighty Captaine, who comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded a hundred and fifty thousand Souldiers, come unto his camp to submit himselfe; judging it also matter of great weight to have that Common-wealth in subjection, for the enterprise which he had in hand, whereby he fully made an account, that the wars were at an end, to the great contentation of him and his company, and with great fame and reputation among the <hi>Indians.</hi> So with a merry and loving countenance he answered, laying first to their charge, the hurt and damage which he had received in their countrey, because they refused at the first to hearken unto him, and quietly to suffer him to enter into their countrey, as he had required and desired by his messengers sent unto them from <hi>Zaclotan.</hi> Yet all this notwithstanding he did both pardon the killing of his two Horses, the assaulting of him in the high way, and the lies which they had most craftily used with him, (for whereas they themselves fought against him, yet they laid the fault to others) likewise their pretence to murther him in the ambush prepared for him (enticing him to come to their Towne) without making first defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance according to the law of Arms. Yet these injuries notwithstanding, he did lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vingly receive their offer made in subjection to the Emperour, and that very shortly he would be with him in <hi>Tlaxcallan.</hi> At this same time there were Ambassadours from <hi>Montezuma</hi> with <hi>Cortez,</hi> who grieved much to see the League that was now beginning between the <hi>Tlaxcalteca's</hi> and the <hi>Spaniards;</hi> they advised <hi>Cortez</hi> to give no credit unto them, saying, they meant nothing but treason, and lies, and to lock them up in <hi>Tlaxcallan. Cortez</hi> answered the Ambassadours, that although their advice were true, yet he did determine to goe thither, for that he feared them lesse in the Towne then in
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:53246:23"/>
the field. They hearing this answer and determination, besought him to give unto one of them licence to returne unto <hi>Mexico,</hi> to advertise <hi>Mont<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>zuma</hi> of all that was past, with an answer to their ambassage, promising within six dayes to have newes from <hi>Mexico,</hi> and till then prayed him not to depart with his campe. <hi>Cortez</hi> granted their request, and abode there the time appointed, expecting their answer, and within him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe rejoycing to see how the <hi>Mexicans</hi> began to feare, that his peace with the <hi>Tlaxeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teca's</hi> would be their ruine and destruction, as indeed afterwards it proved. In this mean season came many of <hi>Tlaxcallan</hi> to the campe, some brought Turkey cockes, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther brought bread and cherries, with merry countenances, desiring them to goe home with them unto their houses. The sixt day the <hi>Mexican</hi> Ambassadour came according to promise, and brought unto <hi>Cortez</hi> ten jewels of gold, both rich and well wrought, and fifteen thousand garments of Cotton exceeding gallant, and most earnestly besought him on the behalfe of <hi>Montezuma,</hi> that he should not danger himselfe in trusting to the words of the <hi>Tlaxcalteca's,</hi> who were so poore that with necessity they would rob him of the things and presents which his Master had sent him, yea and likewise murther him, knowing of the friendship between his Master and him. At the very same time all the chiefest Lords of <hi>Tlaxcallan</hi> came to intreat him to goe with them to <hi>Tlaxcallan,</hi> where he should be cherished, lodged and well provided: for it was a great dishonour and shame unto them to permit such personages to abide in such vilecottages, as they were in. And if (said they) you trust us not, then we are ready to give you for your security whatsoever pledges or gages you shall demand. And they did both swear and faithfully promise that they might safely goe with them, saying also that the Oath and Faith of their Common-wealth should never be broken for all the goods in the world. Thus was <hi>Cortez</hi> on both sides earnestly solicited, and intreated; the <hi>Mexicans</hi> fearing his League and friendship with the <hi>Tlaxcalteca's,</hi> and these hoping that his friendship with them would be their chiefe protection against the tyranny of <hi>Montezu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma.</hi> But <hi>Cortez</hi> aiming chiefly at the Empire of <hi>Mexico,</hi> which <hi>Montezuma</hi> his dissem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled friendship would never helpe him to enjoy; and seeing the good will of so many gentlemen his new friends of <hi>Tlaxcallan,</hi> the most mortall enemies of <hi>Montezuma,</hi> and likewise the <hi>Indians</hi> of <hi>Zempoallan,</hi> of whom he had good credit, did so impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune him, and assure him of his going, he commanded his Fardage to be laden, and also his Ordnance, and departed toward <hi>Tlaxcallan,</hi> with as good order as it had been to a battail; and at the Tower where he had pitched his camp, he left certain crosses for a memory with a great heape of stones (which till this day remain in the place, and my selfe have seen them) and entred into <hi>Tlaxcallan</hi> the eighteenth of <hi>September.</hi> There came out such a multitude of people to see him and to meet him in the way, that it was a wonder to see. He was lodged in the greatest Temple, which had many great and fair lodgings sufficient for him and all his company, except the <hi>Indians</hi> of <hi>Zempoallan</hi> and <hi>Zaclotan</hi> his friends, who were lodged in other Temples. He set cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine limits, out of the which he commanded straitly that none of his company should passe upon pain of death, and also commanded that they should take nothing, but what should be given them. His commandement was well observed, for none presu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to goe a stones cast without his licence. The <hi>Indian</hi> gentlemen shewed great plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure and curtesie to the strangers, and provided them of all things necessary, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them gave their daughters unto them in token of true friendship, and likewise to have fruit of their bodies, to be brought up for the wars, being such valiant men. <hi>Cortez</hi> being throughly satisfied of their hearty good wills, demanded of them the estate and riches of <hi>Montezuma.</hi> They exalted him greatly as men that had proved his force. And as they affirmed it was neer a hundred yeers, that they maintained warres with him and his father <hi>

And if it pleased him, he would make as many men double, and thereof they were good witnesse, because they had many times fought with them. <hi>Cortez</hi> told them he was nothing discouraged at all that his power, but intended a journey to <hi>Mexico,</hi> not doubting to oppose <hi>Montezuma,</hi> if hee should encounter him in the way. He promised them likewise that he would free them from his tyranny, and su<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

and did any way annoy them and their Common-wealth. They gave him hearty thankes, assuring him to assist him and accompany him to <hi>Mexico;</hi> and for the present offered him twenty thousand men, making a solemne League and Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant never to forsake him. Thus was <hi>Tlaxcallan</hi> subdued and sworne to the power and command of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> being in those times one of the chiefest, though not richest, Townes in <hi>America;</hi> whose Inhabitans after clave most faithfully to <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tez,</hi> and were chief instruments for the subduing of <hi>Mexico;</hi> and therefore to this day are freed from tribute by the Kings of <hi>Spain,</hi> paying not the money which as a tribute taxe is layed upon every <hi>Indian</hi> to bee payed yeerely, but onely in acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement of subjection they pay yeerely one corne of <hi>Maiz,</hi> which is their <hi>Indian</hi> Wheat. This great Towne of <hi>Tlaxcallan</hi> is properly in the <hi>Indian</hi> tongue as much as to say, as bread well backed, for there is more Graine called <hi>Centli</hi> gathered, then in all the Province round about. In times past the Towne was called <hi>Texcallan,</hi> that is to say, a Valley betwixt two hills. It is planted by a River side, which springeth out of a hill called <hi>Atlan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

An other street is situated on the hill side towards the River; because at the building thereof, there were many Pine trees, they named it <hi>Ocoteluleo,</hi> which is to say, A pine apple plot. This street was beautifull, and most inhabited of all the Town, and there was the chiefest Market place, where all the buying and selling was used, and that place they called <hi>Tianquiztli;</hi> in that street was the dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling house of <hi>Maxixca.</hi> Along the River side in the plaine standeth another street cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Tizatlan,</hi> because there is much Lime and Chalke. In this street dwelled <hi>Xicoten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catl,</hi> Captaine Generall of the whole Common-wealth. There is another street named by reason of the brackish water, <hi>Quiahuiztlan;</hi> but since the <hi>Spaniards</hi> came thither, all those buildings are almost altered, after a better fashion, and built with stone. In the plain by the river side standeth the Town house, &amp; other Offices, as in the City of <hi>Venice.</hi> This <hi>Tlaxcallan</hi> was governed by Noble and rich men; they used not that one alone should rule, but did rather flie from that Government as from tyranny, and therefore hated <hi>Montezuma</hi> as a tyrant. In their Wars (as I have said before) they had foure Captaines, which governed each one street, of the which foure they did elect a Captaine Generall. Also there were other Gentlemen, that were Under-Captaines, but a small number. In the Wars they used their Standard to bee carried behind the Army, but when the battaile was to be fought, they placed the Standard, where all the Hoste might see it, &amp; he that came not in continent to his Ancientt, payed a penalty. Their Standard had two Crosse-bow Arrowes set thereon, which they esteemed, as the Reliques of their Ancestours. This Standard two old Souldies and valiant men, being of the chiefest Captaines, had the charge to carry, in the which an abuse of soothsaying ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of losse or victory was noted. In this order they shot one of these Arrowes against the first enemies that they met, and if with that Arrow they did either kill or hurt, it was a token that they should have the victory, and if it neither did kil nor hurt, then they assuredly believed that they should lose the field. This Province or Lordship of <hi>Tlax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>callan</hi> had 28. Villages and Townes, wherein were contained 150000 housholders. They are men well made, and were good Warriers, the like were not among the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians.</hi> They are very poore, and have no other riches, but onely the Graine and Corne called <hi>Centli,</hi> and with the gain and profit thereof, they doe both clothe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and provide all other necessaries. They have many Market places, but the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est and most used daily, standeth in the street of <hi>Ocotelulco,</hi> which formerly was so famous, that 20000. persons came thither in one day to buy and sell, changing one thing for another, for they knew not what money meaned. They have now and had formerly all kind of good policy in the Town; there are Goldsmiths, Feather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dressers, Barbers, hot houses, and Potters, who make as good earthen Vessel, as is made in <hi>Spain.</hi> The earth is fat and fruitfull for Corne, fruit, and Pasture, for among the Pinetrees groweth so much grasse, that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> feed their Cattell there, which in <hi>Spain</hi> they cannot doe. Within two Leagues of the Town standeth a round hill
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:53246:24"/>
of six miles of heigth, and five and forty miles in compasse, and is now called St. <hi>Bartholo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inewes</hi> hill, where the snow freezeth. In times past they called that hill <hi>Matealcucie,</hi> who was their God for water. They had also a God for Wine, who was named <hi>Ometochtli,</hi> for the great drunkenesse which they used. Their chiefest God was called <hi>Camaxtlo;</hi> and by another name <hi>Mixcovatl,</hi> whose Temple stood in the street of <hi>Ocotelulco,</hi> in the which Temple there was sacriced some yeeres above eight hundred persons. In the Towne they speak three languages, that is to say, <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bualh,</hi> which is the courtly speech, and chiefest in all the land of <hi>Mexico;</hi> another is called <hi>Otomir,</hi> which is most commonly used in the Villages; There is one onely street that speaketh <hi>Pinomer,</hi> which is the grossest speech. There was also formerly in the Town a common Jayle, where-Felons lay in Irons, and all things which they held for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

At the time that <hi>Cortez</hi> was there it happened that a townsman stole from a <hi>Spaniard</hi> a little gold; whereof <hi>Cortez</hi> complained to <hi>Maxix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca,</hi> who in continent made such enquiry, that the offender was found in <hi>Chololla,</hi> which is another great Town five Leagues from thence; they brought the prisoner with the gold, and delivered him to <hi>Cortez,</hi> to doe with him his pleasure. <hi>Cortez</hi> would not accept him, but gave him thankes for his diligence; then was hee carried with a cryer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, manifesting his offence, and in the Market place upon a Scaffold they brake his joynts with a cudgell: the <hi>Spaniards</hi> marvelled to see such strange justice, and began to bee more confident that as in this point they had endeavoured to pleasure and right them, so likewise they should afterwards find them very forward to doe their wills and pleasures for the better conquering of <hi>Mexico</hi> and <hi>Montezuma. Ocote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lulco</hi> and <hi>Tizatlan,</hi> are the two streets which now are most inhabited; In <hi>Ocotelulco</hi> standeth a Cloister of Franciscan Fryers who are the Preachers of that Town; they have there joyning to their Cloister a very faire Church, to which belong some fifty <hi>Indians</hi> singers, Organists, players on Musicall Instruments, Trumpeters and Waits, who set out the Masse with a very sweet and harmonious Musick, and delight the fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and senses, while the spirit is sad and dull as little acquainted with God, who will bee worshipped in spirit and in truth. In <hi>Tepetiepac</hi> and <hi>Quiahuiztlan</hi> are two Chappels onely, to which on the Lords Day, and upon other occasions the Fryers of the Cloister resort to say Masse. In this Cloister wee were entertained a day and two nights with great Provision of Flesh and Fish, which is very plentifull by reason of the River; The Fryers are allowed by the Town a dozen <hi>Indians</hi> who are free from other services onely to fish for the Fryers. They change their turnes by Weekes, foure one Weeke and foure another, except they be called upon for some speciall occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and then they leave all other worke, and attend onely with fish upon the Fryers. The Town now is inhabited by <hi>Spaniards</hi> and <hi>Indians</hi> together; and is the seat of a chief Officer of Justice sent from <hi>Spain</hi> every three yeares, called <hi>Alcalde Major,</hi> whose power reacheth to all the Townes within twenty Leagues about. Besides him the <hi>Indians</hi> have likewise among themselves, <hi>Alcaldes, Regidores</hi> and <hi>Alguaziles,</hi> su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour and inferiour Officers of Justice appointed yeerely by the <hi>Alcalde Major,</hi> who keepes them all in awe, and takes from them for his service as many as hee pleaseth without paying any thing for the service done unto him. The hard usage of this <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calde Major</hi> and other <hi>Spaniards</hi> hath much decayed that populous Town, which should rather have been cherished, then disheartned by the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who by meanes of it gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all the rest of the Country.</p>

Wee visited all the City, and tooke large notice of it, judging of the wealth and riches of it not only by the great Trading in it, but by the many Cloisters both of Nuns and Fryers, which it maintaineth, such being common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly very burthensome to the places where they live, an idle kind of beggers who make the people believe the maintaining of them is meritorious <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

This City is seated in a low and pleasant Valley, about ten leagues from a very high Mountaine, which is alwayes covered with snow; It standeth twenty leagues from <hi>Mexico,</hi> it was first built and inhabited in the yeare 1530. by the command of <hi>Don Antonio de Mendoza</hi> Vi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

This City is now a Bishops Sea, whose yeerely Revenues since the cutting off from it <hi>Xalappa De la Vera Crux,</hi> are yet worth above twenty thousand Duckats; By reason of the good and wholesome aire it dayly increaseth with Inhabitants, who resort from many other places to live there; but especially the yeare 1634. when <hi>Mexico</hi> was like to bee drowned with the inun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the lake, thousands left it, and came with all their goods and Families to this City of the <hi>Angels,</hi> which now is thought to consist of ten thousand Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants. That which maketh it most famous is the Cloth which is made in it, and is sent farre and neere, and judged now to bee as good as the Cloth of <hi>Segovia,</hi> which is the best that is made in <hi>Spain,</hi> but now is not so much esteemed of, nor sent so much from <hi>Spain</hi> to <hi>America</hi> by reason of the abundance of fine Cloth which is made in this City of <hi>Angels.</hi> The Felts likewise that are made, are the best of all that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; there is likewise a glasse house, which is there a rarity, none other being as yet knowne in those parts. But the mint house that is in it, where is coyned halfe the Silver that cometh from <hi>Sacatecas,</hi> makes it the second to <hi>Mexico;</hi> and it is thought that in time it will bee as great and populous as <hi>Mexico:</hi> Without it there are many Gardens, which store the Markets with provision of Salets; the soile abounds with Wheat, and with Sugar Farmes; among the which not farre from this City there is one so great and populous (belonging to the Dominican Fryers of <hi>Mexico</hi>) that for the work onely belonging unto it, it maintained in my time above two hundred black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more slave<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>This Towne of <hi>Guacocingo</hi> is almost as much as <hi>Tlaxcallan</hi> priviledged by the Kings of <hi>Spain;</hi> for that it joyned with <hi>Tlaxcallan</hi> against the <hi>Mexicans,</hi> in defence of <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nando Cortez</hi> and the rest of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> that first conquered that land. These of <hi>Gua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocingo</hi> being confederated with the inhabitants of <hi>Tlaxcallan, Chololla,</hi> and <hi>Huacacholla</hi> strongly defended the inhabitants of <hi>Chalco,</hi> when they sent to <hi>Cortez</hi> for succour, decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that the <hi>Mexicans</hi> made great spolle among them. Which succour <hi>Cortez</hi> at that time not being able to send them; being busied in sending for his Vergantines to besiege <hi>Mexico</hi> by water as well as by land, he remitted them to the helpe of the <hi>Tlaxcalteoa's,</hi> and unto these of <hi>Guacocingo, Chololla,</hi> and <hi>Huacacholla;</hi> who shewed great valour as yet never buried in oblivion, in relieving <hi>Chalco</hi> against the strength, and power of <hi>Montezuma,</hi> which had issued out of <hi>Mexico,</hi> to keep the <hi>Spaniards</hi> from drawing neer unto that City. For that fact is this Towne with the others fore-mentioned, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till this day priviledged and highly esteemed of the <hi>Spaniards.</hi> From hence wee made our last journey to the City of <hi>Mexico,</hi> passing over the side of that high hill which we had discovered at the City of <hi>Angels,</hi> some thirty miles off. There are no Alpes like unto it for height, cold, and constant snow that lieth upon it. From <hi>Spain</hi> to that place we had not felt any such extremity of cold, which made the <hi>Spaniards</hi> that had come out of the ho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

This last journey from <hi>Guacocingo</hi> to <hi>Mexico</hi> we reckoned to be thirty <hi>English</hi> miles, and of the thirty miles we judged at least the fifteen to be up and downe the hill; and yet the top of it (whither we ascended not) was far higher. From that highest part of it which we travailed over, we discovered the City of <hi>Mexico,</hi> and the lake a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it, which seemed to us to be neer at hand, standing some ten <hi>English</hi> miles in a plain from the bottome of this mountaine. When <hi>Hernando Cortez</hi> went the second time from <hi>Tlaxcallan</hi> to <hi>Mexico,</hi> to besiege it by land and by water, with Vergantines which for that purpose he had caused to be made, on the side of this mountaine were his land Forces lodged, where many had perished with cold, had it not been for the store of wood which they found there. But in the morning he ascended upwards on this hill, and sent his scout of foure Foot-men and four Horse-men to discover, who found the way stopped with great trees newly cut downe by the <hi>Mexicans,</hi> and placed crossewise in the way. But they thinking that yet forwards it was not so, proceeded forth as well as they might, till at length the let with great huge Cedars was such, that they could passe no further, and with this newes were forced to return, certifying <hi>Cortez</hi> that the Horse-men could not passe that way in any wise. <hi>Cortez</hi> demanded of them whether they had seen any people; they answered No. Whereupon he proceeded for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, with all the Horse-men, and a thousand Foot-men, commanding all the residue of his Army to follow him with as much speed as might be; so that with that company which he carried with him, he made way, taking away the trees that were cut downe to disturbe his passage; and in this order in short time passed his host without any hurt or danger, but with great pain and travaile; for certainly if the <hi>Mexicans</hi> had been there to defend that passage, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> had not passed; for it was then a very evill way (though now it be a reason<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

antiquities newly refreshed by the object of the hill and plain beneath, make that cold and hard passage more comfortable and easie unto us. The first Towne we came to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the hill, was <hi>Quabutipec,</hi> of the jurisdiction of <hi>Tezcuco;</hi> where we also called to mind, that this was the place, neer unto which was pitched the Campe of the <hi>Indians</hi> of <hi>Culhua,</hi> which was neer a hundred thousand men of warre, who were sent by the Seniors of <hi>Mexico</hi> and <hi>Tezcuco</hi> to encounter <hi>Cortez;</hi> but all in vain; for his Horse-men broke through them, and his Artillerie made such havock among them, that they were soon put to flight.</p>
               <p>Three leagues from hence on our right hand as we travailed, we discovered <hi>Tezcuco</hi> by the side of the lake, and out of the Rode; yet it ministred unto us matter of a large discourse, taken from the time of <hi>Cortez</hi> and the first Conquerers, who found it a great City, and at that time even as big as <hi>Mexico;</hi> though in it <hi>Cortez</hi> met with no resistance; for as he journeyed towards it, foure principall persons inhabitants of it met with his forces, bearing a rod of gold with a little flag in token of peace, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that <hi>Coacuacoyocin</hi> their Lord had sent them to desire him not to make any spoile in his City, and Townes about it; and likewise to offer his friendship, praying also that it might please him with his whole Army to take his lodging in the Town of <hi>Tezcuco,</hi> where he should be well received. <hi>Cortez</hi> rejoycing at this message, yet jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous of some treachery, and mistrusting the people of <hi>Tezcuco</hi> (whose forces joyned with the <hi>Mexicans</hi> and <hi>Culhuacans</hi> he had met with a little before) went forward on his way and came to <hi>Quahutichan</hi> and <hi>Huaxuta</hi> (which then were suburbs of the great City <hi>Tezcuco,</hi> but now are petty Villages by themselves) where he and all his host were plenteously provided of all things necessary, and threw down the Idols. This done he entred into the City, where his lodging was prepared in a great house, sufficient for him and all the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> with many other his <hi>Indian</hi> friends.

There were at that time at least twenty thousand little boats (called <hi>Canoas</hi>) occupied in carrying houshold-stuffe and passengers; <hi>Cortez</hi> would faine have remedied it, but the night was so nigh at hand, that he could not.

For <hi>Cortez</hi> hearing that <hi>Coacuacoyocin</hi> then King of that City and Townes adjacent was fled, caused many of the Citizens to be called before him, and having in his company a young gentleman of a Noble house in that countrey, who had been lately christened, and had to name <hi>Hernando (Cortez</hi> being his God-father, who loved him well) said unto the Citizens, that this new Christian Lord <hi>Don Hernando</hi> was sonne unto <hi>Nez<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

And <hi>Don Hornando</hi> abode ever after a faithfull friend unto the <hi>Spaniards</hi> in their warres against <hi>Mexico,</hi> and in short time learned the <hi>Spanish</hi> tongue. And soone after came the inhabitants of <hi>Quahutichan, Huaxuta,</hi> and <hi>

Within two daies after <hi>Don Hernando</hi> was made King of this great City and Territorie belonging to it (whose borders reach unto the borders of <hi>Tlaxcallan</hi>) came certaine gentlemen of <hi>Huaxuta</hi> and <hi>Quobutichan,</hi> to certifie unto him, how all the power of the <hi>Mexicans</hi> was coming towards them, and to know if it were his pleasure; that they should carry their wives, children and other goods into the

mountaines, or else to bring them where he was, their feare was so great. <hi>Cortez</hi> for the King his God-child and favourite made unto them this answer, saying, Bee ye of good courage, and feare ye not. Also I pray you to command your wives and families to make no alteration, but rather quietly to abide in your houses. And con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the enemies I am glad of their coming, for yee shall see how I will deale with them. But the enemies went not to <hi>Huaxuta,</hi> as it was thought; neverthelesse <hi>Cortez</hi> having intelligence where they were, went out to encounter them with two pieces of Ordnance, twelve Horsemen and two hundred <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and with many <hi>Indians</hi> of <hi>Tlaxcallan.</hi> He fought with the enemy, and slew but few, for they fled to the water, and so escaped in their <hi>Canoa's.</hi> Thus did <hi>Cortez</hi> in <hi>Tezcuco</hi> defend himselfe and friends from the great power of the <hi>Mexicans,</hi> who daily attempted to be revenged on him, and the new Christian King whom he had made. But <hi>Cortez</hi> thinking that place the most convenient to lanch his Vergantines to the water, and hearing that they were fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished at <hi>Tlaxcallan,</hi> sent <hi>Gonzalo de Sandoval</hi> to bring them from <hi>Tlaxcallan;</hi> who at the border of that Province met with them being brought in pieces, as tables, planks and nayles, with all other furniture, the which eight thousand men carried upon their backes. There came also for their safe conduct twenty thousand men of warre, and a thousand <hi>Tamemez,</hi> who were the Carriers of victuals, and servants. <hi>Chichimecatetl,</hi> a principall and valiant <hi>Indian</hi> and Captaine of a thousand men had the Rere-gard.

Hee appointed also Captaines for each, and himselfe for Generall, whereof some of the chiefest of his Company began to murmur, that went by land, thinking that they had been in greater danger; wherefore they required him to goe with the maine battaile, and not by water. <hi>Cortez</hi> little esteemed their words; for although there was more danger in the land then in the water, yet it did more import to have greater care in the Warres by water, then on the land, because his men had beene in the one, and not in the other. Besides the chiefest hopes that <hi>Cortez</hi> had to winne <hi>Mexico,</hi> were these Vessels, for with them he burned a great part of the <hi>Canoa's</hi> of <hi>Mexico,</hi> and the rest hee so locked up, that they were no help unto the <hi>Mexicans,</hi> and with twelve onely Vergantines hee did annoy his enemy as much by water, as the rest of his Army did by land. All this preparation for the siege of <hi>Mexico</hi> by land and water, with above a hundred thousand <hi>Indians,</hi> besides the <hi>Spanirds</hi> above men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, and the twelve Vergantines by water, was finished in this City of <hi>Tezcuco,</hi> which is a sufficient argument of the greatnesse of it at that time, maintaining with Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision fit and necessary so many thousands of people, and it yeelded matter enough unto us for a large discourse, whilst not farre from the sight of it wee travelled in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen and direct plaine Rode to <hi>Mexico.</hi> And as we talked of the greatnesse of it in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer times, so likewise wee now wondered to consider it to bee but a small Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, where doth constantly reside a <hi>Spanish</hi> Governour sent from <hi>Spain,</hi> whose power reacheth to those borders of <hi>Tlaxcallan</hi> and <hi>Guacocingo,</hi> and to most of the pet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Townes and Villages of the plaine, which were formerly under the command and power of a King; but now are not able to make up above a thousand Duckats a yeer, which is supposed to bee the yeerly revenues of the Governour; and <hi>Tezcuco</hi> it self this day judged to consist onely of a hundred <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and three hundred <hi>Indian</hi> Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, whose chiefe riches come by gardening, and sending daily in their <hi>Canoa's</hi> Herbes and Salets to <hi>Mexico.</hi> Some wealth likewise they get by their Cedar trees which grow there, and are ready timber for the buildings of <hi>Mexico.</hi> Yet now also are these Cedars much decayed by the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who have wasted and spoiled them in their too too sumptuous buildings. <hi>Cortez</hi> onely was accused by <hi>Pamfilo de Narva<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

To the Dominicans belonged this house called St. <hi>Iacintbo,</hi> whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wee were carried, and where wee did abide neere five moneths, having all things provided that were fit and necessary for our Recreations, and for our better encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to a second voiage by Sea. The Gardens belonging to this house might bee of fifteen Acres of ground, divided into shady walkes under the Orange and Lemmon trees; there wee had the Pomegranates, Figges, and Grapes in abundance, with the Plantin, Sapotte, Chicosapotte, Pine-fruit, and all other fruits that were to bee found in <hi>Mexico.</hi> The Herbes and Salets, and great number of <hi>Spanish Cardoes</hi> which were sold out, brought in a great Rent yeerely; for every day there was a Cart attended to bee filled and sent to the Market of <hi>Mexico;</hi> and this not at sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of the yeere, as herein <hi>England</hi> and other parts of <hi>Europe,</hi> but at all times and seasons, both Winter and Summer, there being no difference of heat, cold, frosts, and snow, as with us; but the same temper all the whole yeer, the Winter differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing onely from the Summer by the raine that falls, and not by excessive frosts that nip. This wee enjoyed without dores; but within wee had all sorts and varieties both of fish and flesh. What most wee wondred at, was the abundance of sweet-Meats; and especially of Conserves that were provided for us; for to everyone of us during the time of our abode there, was brought on Munday morning halfe a dozen Boxes of Conserve of Quinces, and other fruits, besides our Biskets, to stay our stomackes in the mornings and at other times of the day; for in our stomackes we found a great difference betweene <hi>Spain</hi> and that Countrey. For in <hi>Spain</hi> and other parts of <hi>Europe</hi> a mans stomack will hold out from meale to meale, and one meale here of good cheer will nourish and cherish the stomack foure and twenty houres; But in <hi>Mexico</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther parts of <hi>America</hi> wee found that two or three houres after a good meale of three or foure severall dishes of Mutton, Veale or Beefe, Kid, Turkies, or other Fowles, our stomackes would bee ready to faint, and so wee were faine to support them with ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a cup of <hi>Chocolatte,</hi> or a bit of Conserve or Bisket, which for that purpose was allowed us in great abundance. This seemed to mee so strange, (whereas the meat seemed as fat and hearty, excepting the Beefe, as ours in <hi>Europe</hi>) that I for some sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction presently had recourse to a Doctor of Physick; who cleared my doubt with this answer, That though the meat we fed on was as faire to looke on, as in <hi>Spain;</hi> yet the substance and nourishment in it came farre short of it, by reason of the pasture, which is dryer and hath not the change of springs which the pastures of <hi>Europe</hi> have,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:53246:27"/>
but is short and withers soone away. But secondly, hee told mee that the Climate of those parts had this effect, to produce a faire shew, but little matter or substance. As in the flesh wee fed on; so likewise in all the fruits there, which are most faire and beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull to behold, most sweet and luscious to taste, but little inward virtue or nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at all in them, not halfe that is in <hi>Spanish Camuesa,</hi> or <hi>English Kentish</hi> Pippin. And as in Meat, and fruit there is this inward and hidden deceit, so likewise the same is to bee found in the people that are borne and bred there, who make faire outward shewes, but are inwardly false and hollow hearted. Which I have heard reported much among the <hi>Spaniards</hi> to have beene the answer of our Queene <hi>Elizabeth</hi> of <hi>England</hi> to some that presented unto her of the fruits of <hi>America,</hi> that surely where those fruits grew, the women were light, and all the people hollow and false hearted. But further reasons I omit to search into for this; of experience onely I write, which taught me that little sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance &amp; virtue is in the great abundance and variety of food which there is enjoyed, our stomackes witnessing this truth, which ever and anon were gaping and crying, Feed, feed. Our Conserves therefore and dainties were plentifully allowed us; and all other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements and no occasion denied us of going to visit <hi>Mexico,</hi> (which was not two full miles from us) all the while wee abode there. It was a pleasant walke for us to goe out in the morning, and to spend all the day in the City and come home at night; our way lying by Arches made of stone, three miles long to convey the water from <hi>Chapultepec</hi> unto the City. Take therefore, gentle Reader, from mee what for the space of five moneths I could learne concerning it in former and present times. The situa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this City is much like that of <hi>Venice;</hi> but onely differs in this, that <hi>Venice</hi> is built upon the Sea-water, and <hi>Mexico</hi> upon a lake, which seeming one, indeed is two; one part whereof is standing water; the other ebbeth and floweth according to the wind that bloweth. That part which standeth, is wholesome, good, and sweet, and yeeld<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth store of small fish. That part which ebbeth and floweth, is of saltish, bitter, and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stiferous water, yeelding no kind of fish, small or great. The sweet water standeth higher then the other, and falleth into it, and reverteth not backward, as some conceive it doth. The salt Lake containeth fifteen miles in breadth, and fifteen in length, and more then five and forty in Circuite; and the Lake of sweet water containeth even as much; in such sort that the whole Lake containeth much about a hundred miles. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> are divided in opinions concerning this water and the springs of it; some hold that all this water hath but one spring out of a great and high Mountaine which standeth Southwest within sight of <hi>Mexico,</hi> and that the cause that the one part of the Lake is brackish or saltish, is that the bottome or ground is all salt; But however this opinion bee true or false, certaine it is and by experience I can witnesse that of that part of the salt water great quantity of Salt is dayly made, and is part of the great Trading of that City into other parts of the Countrey, nay it is sent part of it to the <hi>Philippina</hi> Islands. Others say that this Lake hath two springs, and that the fresh water springeth out of that Mountaine which standeth Southwest from <hi>Mexico,</hi> and the salt brakish water springeth out of other high Mountaines which stand more Northwest; But these give no reason for the saltnesse of it, without it bee the agitation of it in the eb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing and flowing; which not being with tides like the Sea, but with the winds one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly (which indeed make it as stormy sometimes as is the Sea) why may not the winds produce the same effect in the fresh water Lake? I think rather, if it spring from a different spring from that from whence springeth the fresh water, the brackishnesse and saltishnesse of it may proceed from some brackish and sulphurous minerals through which it passeth in those Mountaines. For by experience I know the like in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of <hi>Guatemala,</hi> whereby a Towne called <hi>Amatitan,</hi> there is a standing Lake of water not altogether sweet and fresh, but a little brackish, which certainly hath its spring from a fiery Mountaine called there a <hi>Vulcan,</hi> (whose burning proceeds from the Mine<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> of brimstone that are within it) from whence spring neere the same Towne likewise two or three springs of exceeding hot water, which are resorted to for wholesome bathes, as coming through a sulphurous mine, and yet the standing Lake proceeding from the same Mountaine is of that quality that maketh it the ground about it salt, and and especially in the mornings the people go to gather up the salt which lyeth upon the ground by the water side like unto a hoary frost. But thirdly, others concieve that that part of the Lake of <hi>Mexico</hi> which is saltish and brackish comes through the earth from the North Sea<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and though springs of water which come from the Sea lose their
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:53246:28"/>
brackishnesse through the earth, yet this may keepe some brackishnesse by reason of the minerals, which are many in those parts; or by reason of the great, wide and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen concavities of those mountaines, which being very hollow within (as wee find by experience of the Earthquakes which are more frequent there then hereby reason of the wind that getteth into those concavities, and so shake the earth to get out) give no way to the water to sweeten through the earth, or to lose all that saltnesse which it brought with it from the Sea. But whatsoever the true reason bee, there is not the like Lake knowne of sweet and saltish water, one part breeding fish, the other breeding none at all. This Lake had formerly some fourescore Townes, some say more, situated round about it; many of them containing five thousand housholds, and some ten thousand, yea and <hi>Tezcuco</hi> (as I have said before) was as bigge as <hi>Mexico.</hi> But when I was there, there might bee thirty Townes and Villages about it, and scarce any of above five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred housholdes between <hi>Spaniards</hi> and <hi>Indians;</hi> such hath beene the hard usage of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> towards them, that they have even almost consumed that poore Nation. Nay two yeers before I came from those parts, which were the yeers of 1635. and 1636. I was credibly informed that a million of <hi>Indians</hi> lifes had been lost in an indeavour of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> to turne the water of the Lake another way from the City, which was performed by cutting away through the Mountaines, for to avoid the great inundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that <hi>Mexico</hi> was subject unto, and especially for that the yeer 1634. the waters grew so high that they threatned destruction to all the City, ruinating a great part, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into the Churches that stood in the highest part of it, in so much that the people used commonly boats and <hi>Canoa's</hi> from house to house. And most of the <hi>Indians</hi> that lived about the Lake were imployed to strive against this strong Element of water, which hath been the undoing of many poore wretches, but especially of these thirty Towns and Villages that bordered near upon the Lake; which now by that great work is further from the houses of the City; and hath a passage made another way, though it was thought it would<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> not long continue, but would find againe its old course towards <hi>Mexico.</hi> This City when <hi>Cortez</hi> first entred into it, (was as some say) of sixty, but more probably it is reported to have beene of fourescore thousand houses. <hi>Montezuma</hi> his palace was very great, large and beautifull, which in the <hi>Indian</hi> language was named <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pac;</hi> and that had twenty doores or gates, which had their outcoming into the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon streets. It had three Courts; and in the one stood a faire Fountaine, many hals, and a hundred chambers of three and twenty, and thirty foot long, an hundred bathes, and hot houses; and all this without nailes, yet very good workmanship. The walls were made of Masons worke, and wrought of Marble, Iaspe, and other black stone, with veines of red, like unto Rubies and other stones which glistered very faire; the roofs were wrought of timber, and curiously carved, being of Cedar, Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pres, and Pine tree; the Chambers were painted and hung with cloth of Cotton, and of Coneys haire and feathers. The beds onely were unseeming this great s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in this Palace lived a thousand women, nay some affirme three thousand, reckoning gentlewomen, servants and slaves, all together; But the most were principall <hi>Indians</hi> daughters; of whom <hi>Montezuma</hi> tooke for himselfe those that liked him best, and the others hee gave in marriage to gentlemen his servants. It is credibly reported among the <hi>Spaniards</hi> that hee had at one time a hundred and fifty women his wives with child, who commonly tooke medicines to cast their creatures, because they knew that they should not inherit the State; and these had many old women to guard them, for no man was permitted to looke upon them. Besides this <hi>Tepac,</hi> which signifieth, Palace, <hi>Montezuma</hi> had yet in <hi>Mexico</hi> another house with very curious lodgings and fair Galleries, built upon pillars of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

There did belong to that house above three hundred persons of service, who had their severall charge concerning these Fowles; some had care to cleanse the Ponds;
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:53246:28"/>
others were appointed to fish for bait; others served them with meat; and to every kind of fowle they gave such bait as they were wont to feed of in the fields or rivers; others did trim their feathers; others had care to look to their egs; others to set them abrood; &amp; the principallest office was to pluck the feathers; for of them were made rich mantles, tapi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry, targets, tuffes of feathers, and many other things wrought with gold and silver.</p>
               <p>Besides this house, <hi>Montezums</hi> had yet another house within <hi>Mexico,</hi> appointed only for hawking fowles, and fowles of rapine. In which house there were many high Halls, wherein were kept men, women, and children, such as were dwarfes, crook<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>backs or any monstrous persons, and with them such as were born white of colour, which did very seldome happen; nay some would deform their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren on purpose to have them carried to the Kings house, to helpe to set forth his great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse by their deformity. In the lower Halls of this house there were Cages for fowl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

This house had for dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly allowance five hundred Turkey cocks, and three hundred men of service, besides the Falconers and Hunters, which some say were above a thousand men.

Yet out of <hi>Mexico</hi> he had Orchards with many and sundry fruits; and likewise pleasant houses in woods and forrests, of great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe, environed with water, in the which he had fountaines, rivers, ponds with fish, rockes and coverts where were Harts, Bucks, Hares, Foxes, Wolves and such like, whither he himselfe seldome went; but the Lords of <hi>Mexico</hi> used to goe to sport themselves in them. Such and so many were the houses of <hi>Montezuma;</hi> wherein few Kings were equall with him. He had dayly attending upon him in his privy guard six hundred noblemen and gentlemen, and each of them three or foure servants, and some had twenty servants or more according to their estate; and the most credible re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port goes, that in this manner he had three thousand men attendants in his Court, all which were fed in his house of the meat that came from his table. There were in those times under the <hi>Mexicall</hi> empire three thousand Lords of Townes, who had many vas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sals; but more especially there were thirty of high estate, who were able to make each of them a hundred thousand men of warre. And all these noble men did abide in <hi>Mexico,</hi> certaine time of the yeare in the Court of <hi>Montezuma,</hi> and could not depart from thence without especiall licence of the Emperour, leaving each of them a sonne or brother behind them for security of rebellion; and for this cause they had general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly houses in the City; such and so great was the Court of <hi>Montezuma.</hi> Moreover he spent nothing in the buildings of all these his houses, for he had certaine Townes that payed no other tribute, but only to work and repair continually his houses at their own proper cost, and payed all kind of workemen, carrying upon their backes, or drawning in sleds stone, lyme, timber, water, and all other necessaries for the worke. Likewise they were bound to provide all the wood that should be spent in the Court, which was five hundred mens burthens, and some daies in the winter much more. But especially for the Emperours chimneys they brought the barke of Oke trees, which was esteemed for the light. Thus was that great City formerly illustrated with a mighty Monarch, his houses, and attendants. There were then also in <hi>Mexico</hi> three sorts of streets, very broad and faire; the one sort was only of water, with many bridges, another sort of only earth, and the third of earth and water, the one half being firme ground to walke upon, and the other halfe for boats to bring provision to the City; the most part of the houses had two doores, the one toward the Cawsey, and the other toward the water, at the which they tooke boat to goe whither they list. But this water (though so neer to the houses) being not good to drinke, there is other water fresh and sweet brought by conduit to <hi>Mexico,</hi> from a place called <hi>Chapul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tepec</hi> three miles distant from the City, which springeth out of a little hill, at the foot whereof stood formerly two statues, or images wrought in stone, with their Targets and Launces, the one of <hi>Montezuma,</hi> the other of <hi>Axaiaca</hi> his father. The water is brought from thence to this day in two pipes built upon Arches of brick and stone like a fair bridge; and when the one pipe is foule, then all the water is conveyed into the other, till the first be made cleane. From this fountaine all the whole City is provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and the Water-men go selling the same water from street to street, some in little boats, others with earthen Tankards upon Mules or Asses backs. The chiefe and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall division of this City when the <hi>Spaniards</hi> first conquered it, was into two streets, the one was called <hi>Tlatelulc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

The first King that was thus elected, was called <hi>Vitzilovitli;</hi> the second, <hi>Acamopitzli;</hi> the third, <hi>Chimalpapoca;</hi> the fourth, <hi>Izchoalt;</hi> the fifth, <hi>Montezuma</hi> the first; the sixth, <hi>Acacis;</hi> the seventh, <hi>Axaiaca;</hi> the eighth, <hi>Antzlol;</hi> the ninth, <hi>Montezuma</hi> the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, who reigned when <hi>Cortez</hi> came first; the tenth, was <hi>Quahutimoc,</hi> who lost <hi>Mex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ico,</hi> and in whom ended that <hi>Indian</hi> Empire. The most fortunate of these Kings was <hi>Izchoalt,</hi> who by his cousin <hi>Tlacacllec,</hi> subdued the other six Tribes, and brought them under the <hi>Mexican</hi> Kings. And after the death of <hi>Izchoalt, Tlacacllec</hi> was by the first electours (which were six in number) chosen King, as a man of whose vertue they had formerly made try all. But he very nobly refused it, saying that it was more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient for the Common-wealth that another should be King, and that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

Upon this generous refusall they made choice of <hi>Montezuma</hi> the first. The most unhappy Kings of that nation (at whose birth could not but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

But this imprisonment of their Emperour stirred up the hearts of all the <hi>Mexicans</hi> to conspire against <hi>Cortez</hi> and the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> against whom they fought a most fierce and bloody battaile two or three daies together, crying out for their Emperour, and threatning them with the cruellest death that ever man suffered. Whereupon <hi>Cortez</hi> desired <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tezuma</hi> to goe up into the Sotie of his house which they were battering with stones, and to command his subjects to cease from their heat and fury; who at <hi>Cortez</hi> his request went up and leaned over the wall to talke with them, and beginning to speake unto them, they threw so many stones out of the street, houses, and windows, that one happened to hit <hi>Montezuma</hi> on the temples of his head, with which blow he fell down dead to the ground; and this was his end, even at the hands of his owne subjects and vassals against their wills, in the City of his greatest glory, and in the power and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stody of a forain and strange nation. The <hi>Indians</hi> affirm that he was of the greatest blood of all his linage, and the greatest King in estate that ever was in <hi>Mexico.</hi> And from hence it may very well be noted, that when Kingdomes doe most flourish, then are they nighest to a change, or els to change their Lord, as doth appeare in this Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of <hi>Montezuma,</hi> whose great glory and majesty presaged the downfall of that City and people; who though after the death of <hi>Montezuma</hi> they made <hi>Quahutimoc</hi> their Emperour, and persisting in their furious battery against <hi>Cortez</hi> his palace, caused him and all his <hi>Spaniards</hi> to flie out of <hi>Mexico;</hi> yet having strengthened themselves againe in <hi>Tlaxcallan;</hi> and prepared sixteen, or as others say, eighteen Vergantines for the lake, they soone after besieged <hi>Mexico</hi> so by water and land, that the Citizens were in great necessity, and so many dead with hunger and sicknesse, that there were heapes of dead bodies in the houses, only to keep close their extreme misery; who would not yeeld even when they saw their King <hi>Quahutimoc</hi> his fair houses burned, and the greatest

part of their City consumed with fire and beaten downe plaine with the ground, so long as they could injoy any one street, Tower, or Temple to defend themselves and oppose the <hi>Spaniards;</hi> who after many fierce and bloody fights by land and with their boates by water having wonne the chief Market place and most of the City, as they went walking in the streets found heapes of dead bodies in the houses, streets, and in the water, and the very barkes of trees and roots gnawne by the hungry crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and the men so leane and yellow that it was a pitifull sight to behold. And with this <hi>Cortez</hi> yet required them to yeeld; but they although they were so leane of body were strong in heart, and answered that hee should not speak of any friendship to them, nor yet hope of their spoile, for when no fortune would fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour them, then they would either burne their treasure, or throw it into the Lake, where they should never profit thereby, and that they would fight while one alone should remain alive.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cortez</hi> desirous to see what remained of the City to win, went up into a high Tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and having well viewed the City, hee judged that of eight parts one remained yet to win. And assaulting the same, the sorrowfull Citizens bewailing their unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate fate and destiny, beseeching the <hi>Spaniards</hi> to make an end, and to kill them all out of hand; others standing at the brim of the water neere unto a draw-bridge cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out, Oh Captain <hi>Cortez,</hi> seeing that thou art the Child of the Sun, why dost thou not intreat the Sun thy Father to make an end of us?

                  </hi> desiring him to consider his Subjects great extremity, which yet might be greater if hee yeelded not to Peace. But when the stubborn King heard this ambassage, hee was so moved with ire and choler, that forthwith hee commanded <hi>Cortez</hi> his Ambassadour to bee sacrificed, and gave the rest of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> that went with him for answer blowes with stones, staves and Arrowes, saying that they desired death and no Peace. Whereupon <hi>Cortez</hi> seeing the King so stubborn and refractory after so much slaughter and misery of his subjects, after so many Combates and skirmishes made with the losse of almost all the City, sent forthwith <hi>Sandoval</hi> with his Vergan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines one way, and went himself another combating the houses and forts that yet remained, where hee found small resistance, so that hee might doe what hee pleased. One would have thought there had not been five thousand left in all the City seeing the heapes of dead bodies that lay about the streets and in the houses, and yet such was this last combate, that there were that day slain and taken prisoners forty thousand per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons. The lamentable cry and mourning of the women and children, would have made a strong heart relent, the stench also of the dead bodies was wonderfull noysome. That night <hi>Cortez</hi> purposed to make an end the next day of the Warres; and <hi>Quahutimoc</hi> pretended to flie, and for that purpose had enbarked himself in a <hi>Canoa</hi> of twenty Oares. When the day appeared, <hi>Cortez</hi> with his men, and foure Peeces of Ordnance came to the corner where those that yet remained were shut up as Cattel in a Pound. Hee gave order to <hi>Sandoval</hi> and <hi>Alvarado</hi> what they should doe, which was to be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy with their Vergantines, and to watch the coming out of the <hi>Canoa's,</hi> which were hidden betwixt certaine houses, and especially to have regard unto the Kings person, and not to hurt him, but to take him alive. Hee commanded the residue of his men to force the <hi>Mexican</hi> boates to goe out, and hee himselfe went up into a Tower, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring for the King, where hee found <hi>Xihuacoa,</hi> Governour and Captaine Generall of the City, who would in no wise yeeld himself. Then came out of the City a great multitude of old folkes, men, women and children to take boat. The throng was so great with hast to enter the <hi>Canoa's,</hi> that many by that meanes were drowned <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

without any resistance, and presently beat down <hi>Quahutimoc</hi> his Royall Standard. <hi>Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia Holguin</hi> who was a Captaine of one of the Vergantines, espied a great <hi>Canoa</hi> of twenty Oares deep laden with men, who (being by one of his prisoners informed that the King was in it) gave chase to it and presently overtooke it. When <hi>Quahuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moc,</hi> who stood upon the Puppe of his <hi>Canoa</hi> ready to fight, saw the <hi>Spaniards</hi> Crosse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bowes bent to shoot, and many drawne swords against him, hee yeelded himselfe, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring that hee was King. <hi>Garcia Holguin</hi> being a glad man of such a prisoner tooke him and carried him unto <hi>Cortez,</hi> who received him very respectfully. But when <hi>Quahutimoc</hi> came neer unto him, hee laid his hand upon <hi>Cortez</hi> his dagger, saying, I have done all my best and possible endeavour to defend my self and my Vassals accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to my duty, hoping not to have come to this estate and place where now I stand; and considering that you may doe with mee what you please, I beseech you to kill mee, and that is my onely request. <hi>Cortez</hi> comforted him with faire words, giving him hope of life; and tooke him up into a <hi>Zotie,</hi> requiring him to command his Subjects that yet held out, to yeeld and render themselves. Which <hi>Quahutimoc</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently performed; and at that time after so many Prisoners taken, and so many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands slain and starved, there were about threescore and ten thousand persons, who seeing their Prince a Prisoner, threw down their weapons and submitted themselves. Thus did <hi>Hernando Cortez</hi> winne the famous and stately City of <hi>Mexico,</hi> on the 13. day of <hi>August, Anno Dom.</hi> 1521. In remembrance whereof every yeere on that day they make in <hi>Mexico</hi> a sumptuous feast and solemne procession, wherein is carried the Standard Royall, with the which the City was wonne. In the losse of it was as much to bee observed as Antiquity can produce of any Victory; wherein was one Emperour the greatest that ever was in those parts slain; and another as great a War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rier as ever <hi>America</hi> had knowne, taken Prisoner. The Siege endured from the time the Vergantines came from <hi>Tlaxcallan</hi> three moneths, and therein were on <hi>Cortez</hi> his side neer 200000 <hi>Indians,</hi> who dayly increased and came in to help him, 900 <hi>Spaniards;</hi> fourescore horses onely, seventeen or eighteen Peeces of Ordnance; sixteen or as some say eighteen Vergantines, and at least 6000 <hi>Canoa's.</hi> In this Siege were slain fifty <hi>Spaniards</hi> onely and six horses, and not above eight thousand of the <hi>Indians Cortez</hi> his friends. And on the <hi>Mexicans</hi> side were slaine at least a hundred and twenty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand <hi>Indians,</hi> besides those that died with hunger and Pestilence. At the defence of the City were all the Nobility, by reason whereof many of them were slaine. The multitude of people in the City was so great, that they were constrained to eat little, to drink salt water, and to sleep among the dead bodies, where was a horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble stench; and for these causes the disease of Pestilence fell among them, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of died an infinite number. Whereupon is to bee considered their valour, and sted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fast determination; for although they were afflicted with such hunger that they were driven to eat boughes, rindes of trees, and to drink salt water, yet would they not yeeld themselves. And here also is to be noted that although the <hi>Mexicans</hi> did eat mans flesh, yet they did eat none but such as were their enemies; for had they eaten one another and their owne children, there would not so many have died with hunger. The <hi>Mexican</hi> women were highly commended, not onely because they abode with their husbands and fathers, but also for the great paines they tooke with the sick and wounded persons; yea and also they laboured in making slings, cutting stones fit for the same, and throwing stones from the <hi>Zoties;</hi> for therein they did as much hurt as their men. The City was yeelded to the spoile, and the <hi>Spaniards</hi> tooke the gold, plate and feathers, the <hi>Indian</hi> friends had all the rest of cloth and other stuffe. Thus was that famous City ruinated, and burnt by the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and the power of that Nation brought under the <hi>Spanish</hi> subjection. <hi>Cortez</hi> having found the aire of that City very temperate and pleasant for mans life, and the situation commodiou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

But before I come to speake of it as rebuilded and now flourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, I must adde unto what hath been said of <hi>Montezuma</hi> his former state and houses in it, the greatnesse of the Market place and Temple, which was in it, when the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi> ruined and destroyed it. The conveniency of the Lake about this City gave en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement to the <hi>Mexicans</hi> to set apart a most spatious Market place, whither all the Country about might resort to buy, exchange and sell; which was the more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie for them by reason of the abundance of Boates which were made onely for such Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fique.

This place was wide and large compassed about with dores, and was so great that a hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand persons came thither to chop and change, as a City most principall in all that regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Every occupation and kind of merchandize had his proper place appointed, which no other might by any means occupie or disturb.

The colours and strangenesse thereof was a thing to behold. The richest merchandize was salt, and mantles of Cotton wool of divers colours, both great and small; some for beds, other for garments and clothing, other for Tapistry to hang houses; other Cotton-cloth was wont to be sold there for linnen drawers (which to this day the <hi>Indians</hi> use) for shirts, table cloths, towels, and such like things.

But the chiefe bravery of that market was the place where gold and feathers joyntly wrought were sold; for any thing that was in request, was there lively wrought in gold and feathers and gallant colours.

although there were some of that art, and many Apothecaries, who did bring into the market, oyntments, syrups, waters, and other drugs fit for sick persons. They cure all diseases almost with herbs; yea as much as for to kill lice they have a proper herb for the purpose. The severall kinds of meats to bee sold was without number, as Snakes without head and tail, little dogges gelt, Moules, Rats, Long-wormes, Lyce, yea and a kind of earth; for at one season in the yeer they had Nets of Mayle, with the which they raked up a certaine dust that is bred upon the water of the lake of <hi>Mexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co,</hi> and that is kneaded together like unto oas of the sea. They gathered much of this and kept it in heapes, and made thereof cakes like unto brick-bats. And they did not only sell this ware in the Market, but also sent it abroad to other Fayres and markets afarre off; and they did eat this meal with as good a stomack as we eat cheese; yea and they hold opinion, that this skumme or fatnesse of the water is the cause that such great number of fowl cometh to the lake, which in the winter season is infinite. They sold likewise in this market Venison by quarters or whole, as Does, Hares, Conies, and Dogges, and many other beasts, which they brought up for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose and tooke in hunting. The great store of sundry kinds of fruits was marvellous, which were there sold, both green and ripe. There is a sort as bigge as an Almond called <hi>Cacao</hi> (whereof is the drinke called <hi>Chocolatte</hi> well known now in Christendome) which is both meat and currant money. In these times of the bigger sort sixscore or sevenscore, and of the lesser sort two hundred are worth a <hi>Spanish</hi> Riall, which is sixpence, and with these the <hi>Indians</hi> buy what they list; for five, nay for two Cacao's which is a very small part of a Riall, they doe buy fruits and the like. There were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers kinds of colours to be sold, which they made of roses, flowers, fruits, barks of trees, and other things very excellent. All the things recited, and many others which I speak not of, were sold in this great market, and in every other Market of <hi>Mexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co;</hi> and all the sellers payed a certain summe for their shops of standings to the King, as a custome, and they were to be preserved and defended from theeves and robbers. And for that purpose there went Serjeants or Officers up and down the market to espie out malefactors. In the midst of this Market stood a house, which was to bee seen throughout the Fayr, and there did sit commonly twelve ancient men for Judges to dispatch law matters. Their buying and selling was to change one ware for another, one gave a hen for a bundle of Maiz, others gave mantles for salt or money which was <hi>Cacao.</hi> They had measure and strike for all kind of corne, and other earthen measures for hony and oyle, and such wines as they made of Palme-trees, and other roots and trees. And if any measure were falsified, they punished the offenders and brake their measures. This was the civility they had when they were Heathens, for buying and selling. And although they knew not the true God, but worshipped Idols; yet to their Idols and to the Divell they dedicated Temples and places of worship, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they used those sacrifice which <hi>David</hi> speaks of in the 106. <hi>Ps.</hi> 37. saying, <hi>They sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed their sonnes, and their daughters unto Devills.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Temple is called in the <hi>Mexican</hi> language <hi>Teucalli,</hi> which is a compound word of <hi>Teutl,</hi> which signifieth God, and <hi>Calli,</hi> which signifieth a house. There were in <hi>Mexico</hi> many parish Churches with towers, wherein were Chappels and Altars where the Images and Idols did stand. All their Temples were of one fashion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the like I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve was never seen nor heard of. And therefore it shall be now sufficient to describe the chiefe and greatest Temple, which was as their Cathedrall Church. This Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple was square, and did containe every way as much ground as a Crosse-bow can reach levell. It was made of stone, with four dores that abutted upon the three Cawseys, and upon another part of the City that had no Cawsey, but a fair street. In the midst of this Quadern stood a mount of earth and stone square likewise, and fifty fadome long every way, built upward like unto a pyramide of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> saving that the top was not sharpe, but plain and flat, and ten fadom square. Upon the West side were steps up to the top, in number a hundred and fourteen, which being so many, high and made of good stone, did seeme a beautifull thing. It was a strange sight to behold the Preists, some going up, and some downe with ceremonies, or with men to be sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced. Upon the top of this Temple were two great Altars, a good space distant the one from the other, and so nigh the edge or brimme of the wall, that scarcely a man might go behind them at pleasure. The one Altar stood on the right hand, and the other on the left<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they were but of five foot high; each of them had the back part made of

And because <hi>Cortez</hi> and his company should see the beauty thereof, <hi>Montezuma</hi> himselfe (to ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

There was a certain plot or space for the Idoll Preists to celebrate their service without disturbance of any. Their generall prayers were made toward the rising of the sunne; upon each Altar stood a great Idoll.</p>
               <p>Besides this tower which stood upon the Pyramide, there were fourty towers great and small belonging to other little Temples which stood in the same circuite<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the which although they were of the same making, yet their prospect was not West-ward, but other waie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Some of these Temples were bigger then others, and every one of a severall God; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the which there was one round Temple dedicated to the God of the ayre called <hi>Quecalcovatl;</hi> for even as the ayre goeth round about the heaven<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>, even for that conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration they made his Temple round. The entrance of that Temple had a dore made like unto the mouth of a Serpent, and was painted with foule and divellish gestures, with great teeth and gummes wroug<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

There were other Teucallies in the City, that had the ascending up by steps in three places; and all these Temples had houses by themselves with all service belonging to them, and Preists, and particular Gods.

At every dore of this great Temple of <hi>Mexico</hi> stood a large hall, and goodly lodgings both high and low round about, which houses were common Armories for the City. The Heathens it seems had so much understanding as to know that the force and strength of a Towne, City, or Countrey is the Temple, and therefore they placed there their storehouse of munition.</p>
               <p>They had other darke houses full of Idols great and small, wrought of sundry me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

with roses and flowers for the Altars; and this is also the Church of <hi>Romes</hi> custome and superstition, to trim and deck their Saints and Altars with Garlands and Crowns of Roses and other flowers. Such, so great and strange was this Temple of <hi>Mexico,</hi> for the service of the devill, who had deceived those simple <hi>Indians.</hi> There did reside (as I said before of Monkes and Fryers in their Cloisters joyning to their Churches) in this Temple and houses joyning to it, continually five thousand persons, and all these were lodged and had their living there; for that Temple was marvellous rich, and had divers Townes onely for their maintenance, and reparation, and were bound to sustaine the same alwaies on foot. These Townes did sow corn, and maintain all those five thousand persons with bread, fruit, flesh, fish, and firewood as much as they needed, for they spent more firewood then was spent in the Kings Court. These per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons did live like <hi>Romes</hi> Abby-lubbers at their hearts ease, as servants and vassals unto the Gods, which were many; and every God had severall rankes and Orders of Preists to serve him; as the severall Saints canonized by the Popes of <hi>Rome</hi> have under them distinct Religious Orders of Preists, Dominick hath Dominicans, Francis Franci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scans, Benedict Benedictines, Basil Basilians, Bernard Bernardines, Augustin Augustines, and the like.</p>

of that water. And as the <hi>Romish</hi> Church makes much of their dead mens skulles and rotten bones, laying them up in their Churchyards under some arches made for that purpose in the Churchwalls, even so was it here in <hi>Mexico;</hi> for without this Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and over against the principall doore thereof, a stones cast distant stood a Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell house onely of dead mens heads, prisoners in Warres and sacrificed with the knife. This monument was made like unto a Theatre, more large then broad, wrought of lime and stone, with ascending steps; in the walls whereof was graffed betwixt stone and stone a skull with the teeth outwards. At the foot and head of this Theatre, were two towers made onely of lime and skulles, the teeth outward, which having no other stuffe in the wall seemed a strange <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Each of these staves had others made fast unto them, and every one of them had five skulles broch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed through the temples. When the <hi>Spaniards</hi> first entred into <hi>Mexico</hi> as friends be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the death of <hi>Montezuma</hi> they visited all these monuments; and in what they have written and transmitted to posteriry of that City, it is recorded of one <hi>Andrew de Tapia,</hi> and <hi>Gonzalo de Umbria</hi> that one day they did reckon these skulles, and found a hundred thirty and six thousand skulles on the poles, staves and steps. The other Towers were replenished out of number; and there were men appointed, that when one skull fell, to set up another in his place, so that the number might never want. But all these Towers and Idols were pulled down, and consumed with fire, when the <hi>Spaniards</hi> wanne that City. And certainly they had beene more renowned in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroying those Altars of the devill and those Idoll Gods, if in their stead they had not set up new Idols and Saints of stockes and stones, and built unto them as many more Churches as they found at their comming thither. All therefore that hath been men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned hitherto of <hi>Montezuma</hi> his houses and Gardens, of the spacious Market place, and Temples of that City was utterly destroyed and brought downe to the very ground. But <hi>Cortez</hi> reedified it againe, not onely for the situation and majesty, but also for the name and great fame thereof. Hee divided it among the Conquerours, having first taken out places for Churches, Market places, Towne house and other necessary plots to build houses, profitable for the Common-wealth. Hee separated the dwellings of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> from the <hi>Indians,</hi> so that now the water passeth and maketh division betwixt them.

They built faire Dockes co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered over with Arches for the Vergantines; which Dockes for a perpetuall memory doe remaine untill this day. They dammed up the streets of water, where now faire houses stand, so that <hi>Mexico</hi> is not as it was wont to bee, and especially since the yeare 1634. the water cometh not by farre so neere the City as it was wont to come,

The Lake sometimes casteth out a vapour of stench, but otherwise it is a wholesome and temperate dwelling, by reason of the Mountaines that stand round about it, and well provided through the fertility of the Countrey, and commodity of the Lake. So that now is <hi>Mexico</hi> one of the greatest Cities in the World in extention of the situation for <hi>Spanish</hi> and <hi>Indian</hi> houses. Not many yeeres after the Conquest it was the Noblest City in all <hi>India</hi> as well in Armes as Policy. There were formerly at the least two thousand Citizens, that had each of them his horse in his stable with rich furniture for them, and Armes in readinesse. But now since all the <hi>Indians</hi> farre and neer are subdued, and most of them especially about <hi>Mexico</hi> consumed, and there is no feare of their rising up any more against the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> all armes are forgotten, and the <hi>Spaniards</hi> live so secure from enemies, that there is neither Gate, Wall, Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warke, Platforme, Tower, Armory, Ammunition, or Ordnance to secure and defend the City from a Domestick or forraine enemy; from the latter they thinke St. <hi>Iohn de Ulhua</hi> sufficient and strong enough to secure them. But for Contractation it is one of the richest Cities in in the World; to the which by the North Sea commeth every yeer from <hi>Spain</hi> a Fleet of neere twenty ships laden with the best Commodities not onely of <hi>Spain</hi> but of the most parts of Christendome. And by the South Sea it en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyeth Traffique from all parts of <hi>Peru;</hi> and above all it Trades with the <hi>East-India's,</hi> and from thence receiveth the Commodities as well from those parts which are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited by <hi>Portingals,</hi> as from the Countries of <hi>Iapan</hi> and <hi>China,</hi> sending every yeere two great <hi>Caracas</hi> with two smaller Vessels to the Islands of <hi>Philippinas,</hi> and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving every yeere a returne of such like ships. There is also in <hi>Mexico</hi> a Mint house where Money is dayly coyned; and is brought thither in wedges upon Mules from the Mines called St. <hi>Lewis de Sacatecas,</hi> standing fourescore Leagues from <hi>Mexico</hi> Northward, and yet from <hi>Sacatecas</hi> forward have the <hi>Spaniards</hi> entred above a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Leagues conquering daily <hi>Indians,</hi> where they discover store of Mines; and there they have built a City, called <hi>Nova Mexico,</hi> new <hi>Mexico.</hi> The <hi>Indians</hi> there are great Warriers, and hold the <hi>Spaniards</hi> hard to it. It is thought the <hi>Spaniard</hi> will not bee satisfied, untill hee subdue all the Country that way, which doubtlesse reacheth to our plantations of <hi>Virginia</hi> and the rest being the same continued continent la<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

At the rebuilding of this City there was a great difference betwixt an Inhabitant of <hi>Mexico,</hi> and a Conquerour; for a Conquerour was a name of honour, and had lands and rents given him and to his posterity by the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and the Inhabitant or onely dweller payed rent for his house.

as they call there <hi>Mestizos,</hi> who are of a mixt nature of <hi>Spaniards</hi> and <hi>Indians,</hi> for many poore <hi>Spaniards</hi> marry with <hi>Indian</hi> women, and others that marry them not but hate their husbands, find many trickes to convey away an innocent <hi>Uriah</hi> to enjoy his <hi>Bathsheba.</hi> The <hi>Spaniards</hi> daily cousen them of the small plot of ground where their houses stand, and of three or foure houses of <hi>Indians</hi> build up one good and fair house after the <hi>Spanish</hi> fashion with Gardens and Orchards. And so is almost all <hi>Mexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co</hi> new built with very faire and spatious houses with Gardens of recreation. Their buildings are with stone, and brick very strong, but not high, by reason of the many Earth-quakes, which would indanger their houses if they were above three stories high. The streets are very broad, in the narrowest of them three Coaches may goe, and in the broader six may goe in the breadth of them, which makes the City seeme a great deale bigger then it is. In my time it was thought to bee of betweene thirty and forty thousand Inhabitants <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who are so proud and rich, that half the City was judged to keepe Coaches, for it was a most credible report that in <hi>Mexico</hi> in my time there were above fifteen thousand Coaches. It is a by-word that at <hi>Mexico</hi> there are foure things faire, that is to say, the women, the apparell, the horses, and the streets. But to this I may adde the beauty of some of the Coaches of the gentry, which doe exceed in cost the best of the Court of <hi>Madrid</hi> and other parts of Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome; for there they spare no Silver, nor Gold, nor pretious stones, nor Cloath of Gold, nor the best Silkes from <hi>China</hi> to enrich them. And to the gallantry of their horses the pride of some doth adde the cost of bridles, and shooes of silver. The streets of Christendome must not compare with those in breadth and cleannesse, but especially in the riches of the shops which doe adorn them. Above all the Goldsmiths shops and workes are to bee admired. The <hi>Indians,</hi> and the people of <hi>China</hi> that have been made Christians and every yeere come thither, have perfected the <hi>Spaniards</hi> in that Trade. The Viceroy that went thither the yeere 1625. caused a <hi>Popingay</hi> to bee made of silver, gold, and pretious stones with the perfect colours of the <hi>Popingays</hi> feathers, (a bird bigger then a pheasant) with such exquisite art and perfection, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent unto the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> that it was prized to bee worth in riches and workman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship halfe a Million of Duckats. There is in the Cloister of the Dominicans a lampe hanging in the Church with three hundred branches wrought in silver to hold so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Candles, besides a hundred little lampes for oyle set in it, every one being made with severall wormanship so exquisitely, that it is valued to be worth four hundred thousand duckats; and with such like curious workes are many streets made more rich and beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full from the shops of Goldsmiths. To the by-word touching the beauty of the women I must adde the liberty they enjoy for gaming, which is such that the day and night is to short for them to end a Primera when once it is begun; nay gaming is so com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to them that they invite gentlemen to their houses for no other end. To my self it happened that passing along the streets in company with a Fryer that came with me that yeare from <hi>Spain,</hi> a gentlewoman of great birth knowing us to be <hi>Chapetons</hi> (so they call the first yeer those that come from <hi>Spain</hi>) from her window called unto us, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter two or three slight questions concerning <hi>Spain</hi> asked us if wee would come in and play with her a Game at Primera. Both men and women are excessive in their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parell, using more filkes then stuffes and cloth; pretious Stones and Pearles further much this their vaine ostentation; a hat-band and rose made of Diamonds in a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemans hat is common, and a hat-band of Pearles is ordinary in a Tradesman; nay a Blackmore or Tauny young maide and slave will make hard shift but shee will be in fashion with her Neckchaine and Bracelets of Pearls, and her Eare-bobs of some considerable Jewels.

committed in those places, and yet the Temples mightily enriched by such who have thought those alms a sufficient warrant to free them from hell &amp; Purgatory. But I must return to <hi>Mexico</hi> which is <hi>mille testes</hi> of this truth, fin and wickednesse abounding in it; and yet no such people in the world toward the Church and Clergy, who in their life time strive to exceed one another in their gifts to the Cloisters of Nuns and Friers, some erecting Altars to their best devoted Saints, worth many thousand thousand duc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kats, others presenting crowns of gold to the pictures of <hi>Mary,</hi> others lamps, others gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den chains, others building Cloisters at their own charge, others repairing them, others at their death leaving to them two or three thousand duckats for an annuall stipend. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong these great Benefactors to the Churches of that City I should wrong my History if I should forget one that lived in my time, called <hi>Alonso Cuellar,</hi> who was reported to have a Closet in his house laid with bars of gold in stead of bricks; though indeed it was not so, but only reported for his abundant riches and store of bars of gold which he had in one chest standing in a closet distant from another, where he had a chest full of wedges of silver. This man alone built a Nunery of Franciscan Nuns, which stood him in above thirty thousand duckats, and left unto it for the maintainance of the Nuns two thousand duckats yeerly, with obligation of some masses to be said in the Church every yeer for his soule after his decease. And yet this mans life was so scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous, that commonly in the night with two servants he would round the City, visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting such scandalous persons whose attire before hath been described, carrying his beads in his hands, and at every house letting fall a beade and tying a false knot, that when he came home in the morning towards breake of the day he might number by his beades the uncivil stations he had walked and visited that night. But these his works of darkenesse came to light, and were published farre and neer for what happened unto him whilst I was in <hi>Mexico;</hi> for one night meeting at one of his stations with a gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man that was jealous of him, swords on both sides were drawne, the Concubine first was stabbed by the Gentleman who was better manned and attended; and <hi>Cuellar</hi> (who was but a Merchant) was mortally wounded and left for dead, though after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards he recovered. Great Almes and liberality towards religious houses in that City commonly are coupled with great and scandalous wickednesse. They wallow in the bed of riches and wealth, and make their Almes the Coverlet to cover their loose and lascivious lives. From hence are the Churches so fairly built and adorned. There are not above fifty Churches and Chappels, Cloisters and Nunneries, and Parish Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches in that City; but those that are there are the fairest that ever my eyes beheld, the roofes and beams being in many of them all daubed with gold, and many Altars with sundry marble pillars, and others with Brasil wood staies standing one above another with Tabernacles for several Saints richly wrought with golden colours, so that twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty thousand duckats is a common price of many of them. These cause admiration in the common sort of people, and admiration brings on daily adoration in them to those glorious spectacles and images of Saints; so Satan shewes Christ all the glory of the Kingdomes to intice him to admiration, and then <hi>All these things will I give thee if thou wilt fall downe and worship mee,</hi> Mat. 4. 8, 9. The devill will give all the world to be adored.</p>
               <p>Besides these beautifull buildings, the inward riches belonging to the Altars are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite in price and value, such as Copes, Canopies, hangings, Altar cloths, Candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stickes, Jewels belonging to the Saints, and crownes of gold and silver, and Tabernacles of gold and Crystall to carry about their sacrament in Procession, all which would mount to the worth of a reasonable mine of silver, and would be a rich prey for any nation that could make better use of wealth and riches. I will not speake much of the lives of the Fryers and Nuns of that City, but only that there they enjoy more liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty then in the parts of <hi>Europe</hi> (<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>In my time in the Cloister of the Mercenarian Fryers which is entituled for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption of Captives, there chanced to be an election of a Provinciall to rule over them, to the which all the Priors and heads of the Cloisters about the countrey had resorted, and such was their various and factious difference, that upon the suddain all the Convent was in an uproare, their canonicall election was turned to mutiny and strife, knives were drawn, many wounded, the scandall and danger of murther so
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:53246:35"/>
great, that the Viceroy was faine to interpose his authority and to sit amongst them and guard the Cloister untill their Provinciall was elected. It is ordinary for the Fryers to visit their devoted Nuns, and to spend whole daies with them, hearing their musicke, feeding on their sweet meats, and for this purpose they have many chambers which they call <hi>Loquutorios,</hi> to talke in, with wooden bars between the Nuns and them, and in these chambers are tables for the Friers to dine at; and while they dine, the Nuns recreate them with their voices. Gentlemen and Citizens give their daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to be brought up in these Nunneries, where they are taught to make all sorts of conserves and preserves, all sorts of needle worke, all sorts of musicke, which is so exquisite in that City, that I dare be bold to say, that the people are drawne to their Churches more for the delight of the musick, then for any delight in the service of God. More, they teach these young children to act like players, and to entice the people to their Churches make these children to act short dialogues in their Quires, richly attiring them with mens and womens apparell, especially upon Midsummer day, and the eight daies before their Christmas, which is so gallantly performed, that many factious strifes, and single combates have been, and some were in my time, for defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding which of these Nunneries most excelled in musick, and in the training up of children. No delights are wanting in that City abroad in the world, nor in their Churches, which should be the house of God, and the soules, not the senses delight.</p>
               <p>The chiefe place in the City is the Market place, which though it be not as spaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous as in <hi>Moutezuma</hi> his time, yet is at this day very faire and wide, built all with Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches on the one side where people may walke dry in time of raine, and there are shops of Merchants furnished with all sorts of stuffes and silkes, and before them sit women selling all manner of fruits and herbes; over against these shops and Arches is the Viceroy his palace, which taketh up almost the whole length of the market with the walls of the house and of the gardens belonging to it. At the end of the Viceroy his palace, is the chiefe prison which is strong of stone worke. Next to this is the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull street called <hi>la plateria,</hi> or Gold-smiths street, where a mans eyes may behold in lesse then an houre many millions worth of gold, silver, pearles and jewells. The street of <hi>St. Austin</hi> is rich and comely, where live all that trade in silkes; but one of the longest and broadest streets is the street called <hi>Tacuba,</hi> where almost all the shops are of Ironmongers, and of such as deale in brasse and steel, which is joyning to those Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches whereon the water is conveyed into the City; and is so called for that it is the way out of the City to a Towne called <hi>Tacuba;</hi> and this street is mentioned farre and neer, not so much for the length and breadth of it, as for a small commodity of needles which are made there, and for proofe are the best of all those parts. For stately buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings the street called <hi>del Aquila,</hi> the street of the eagle, exceeds the rest, where live Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, and Courtiers, and Judges belonging to the Chancery, and is the palace of the Marquesse <hi>del Valle</hi> from the line of <hi>Ferdinando Cortez;</hi> this street is so called from an old Idoll an Eagle of stone which from the conquest lieth in a corner of that street, and is twice as big as <hi>London</hi> stone. The gallants of this City shew themselves daily some on Horse-back, and most in Coaches about four of the clock in the afternoone in a pleasant shady field, called <hi>la Alameda,</hi> full of trees and walkes, somewhat like unto our More-fields, where doe meet as constantly as the Merchants upon our Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change about two thousand Coaches, full of Gallants, Ladies, and Citizens, to see and to be seen, to court and to be courted, the Gentlemen having their train of black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more slaves some a dozen, some halfe a dozen waiting on them, in brave and gallant Liveries, heavy with gold and silver lace, with silke stockins on their black legs, and ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses on their feet, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>Many of these suddain skirmishes happened whilest I lived about <hi>Mexico:</hi> of which Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty a whole volume might bee compiled, but that by other Authors much hath beene written, and I desire not to fill my History with trifles, but onely with what is most remarkable in it. I may not omit yet from the situation of it upon a lake to tell that certainly the water hath its passage under all the streets of it; for toward the street of St. <hi>Austin</hi> and the lower parts of the City, I can confidently averre that in my time before the removing of the Lake those that died were rather drowned then buried, for a grave could not bee digged with an ordinary graves depth, but they met with water, and I was eye-witnesse of many thus buried, whose coffins was covered with water. And this is so apparent that had not the Cloister of the <hi>Augustines</hi> often been repair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and almost rebuilt, it had quite sunk by this. In my time it was a repairing, and I saw the old pillars had sunk very low, upon the which they were then laying new foundations, and I was credibly informed that that was the third time that new pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars had been erected upon the old which were quite sunk away. This City hath but three wayes to come unto it by Cawsey; the one is from the West, and that Cawsey is a mile and a halfe long. Another from the North, and containeth three miles in length. Eastward the City hath no entry; but Southward the Cawsey is five miles long, which was the way that <hi>Cortez</hi> entred into it, when hee conquered it.</p>
               <p>The fruit called <hi>Nuchtli</hi> (whereof I have spoken before, and some say this City was called <hi>Tenuchtitlan</hi> from it) though it bee in most parts of <hi>America,</hi> yea and now in <hi>Spain,</hi> yet in no place there is more abundance of it then in <hi>Mexico,</hi> and it is abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely one of the best fruits in it. It is like unto the Figge, and so hath many little ker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels or grains within, but they are somewhat larger, and crowned like unto a Medler. There are of them of sundry colours, some are green without, and carnation-like with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, which have a good taste. Others are yellow, and others white, and some speck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led; the best sort are the white; It is a fruit that will last long. Some of them taste of Pears, and other some of Grapes; It is a cold and a fresh fruit and best esteemed in the heat of summer. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> doe more esteem them then the <hi>Indians.</hi> The more the ground is laboured where they grow, the fruit is so much the better. There is yet another kind of this fruit red, and that is nothing so much esteemed, although his taste is not evill; but because it doth colour and dye the eaters mouth, lips and apparell, yea and maketh the Urine looke like pure blood. Many <hi>Spaniards</hi> at their first comming into <hi>India,</hi> and eating this fruit, were amazed and at their wits end, thinking that all the blood in their bodies came out in Urine; yea and many Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians at their first comming were of the same belief. And it hath happened when they have been sent for unto such as have eaten this fruit, they not knowing the cause, and beholding the Urine, by and by they have administred medicines to staunch blood; a thing to laugh at, to see Physitians so deceived. The skinne of the outside is thick and full of little small prickles, and when it is cut downeright with one cut to the kernels, with one finger you may uncleave the whole skin round about without break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, &amp; take out the fruit to eat. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> use to jest with it with strangers, taking half a dozen of them, and rubbing them in a napkin, those smal prickles which can scarce bee seen or perceived stick invisibly unto the napkin, wherewith a man wiping his mouth to drink, those little prickles stick in his lips so that they seeme to sow them up together, and make him for a while faulter in his speech, till with much rubbing and washing they come off. There is another fruit twice of the bignesse of a great warden, which they call the growing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Manjar Blanco,</hi> or white meat, which is a dainty dish made by them with the white of a Capon, Cream, and Rice, and sugar and sweet wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, much like unto the which tasteth this fruit. It is as sweet as any hony, and dissolves like meked snow in the mouth into a juyce most luscious; within, it is full of hard black kernels or stones, which being cracked are bitter, and these not joyned together, but by division one from another, each one having a bag, or little skin discerning them in their rankes and orders, so that when you cut this fruit in the middle it represents a Cheque <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

away. But I cannot forget that which they call <hi>Pinia,</hi> or Pineapple; not the Pineapple of the high Pine tree, but a pineapple, that groweth upon a lower shrub with prickly leaves, and is bigger then our biggest Muskmillians in <hi>England,</hi> when it is ripe; it is yellow with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out and within; without it is full of little bunches, and within so juycy and cool that nothing more dangerous then to eat much of it. Before they eat it, they cut it in round slices, and lay it a while in salt and water, and so being scoured half an houre in that salt and water which taketh much of the rawnes and coldnes from it, and then putting into dishes with more fresh water they eat it thus. But the better way of eating it, is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served, which is absolutely the best preserve in all that Countrey. There is also the Grape, (though they make not wine of it) the Apple, the Peare, the Quince, the Peach, the Apricock, the Pomegranate, the Muskmillian, the Plantin, the Figge, the Walnut, the Chesnut, the Orange, the Lemmon both sowre and sweet, the Citron in great abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance.

A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout <hi>Mexico</hi> more then in any other part groweth that excellent tree called <hi>Metl,</hi> which they plant and dresse as they doe their Vines in <hi>Europe.</hi> It hath neere forty kindes of leaves, which serve for many uses; for when they bee tender they make of them Conserves, Paper, Flax, Mantles, Mats, Shooes, girdles, and cordage. On these leaves grow certaine prickles so strong and sharpe that they use them in stead of sawes: from the root of this tree cometh a juyce like unto syrup, which being sodde will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Sugar. You may also make of it Wine and Vineger. The <hi>Indians</hi> often become drunke with it. The rind rosted healeth hurts and sores, and from the top boughs issueth a gumme, which is an excellent antidote against poyson. There is nothing in <hi>Mexico</hi> and about it wanting which may make a City happy; and certainly had those that have so much extolled with their pens the parts of <hi>Granada</hi> in <hi>Spain, Lombardy</hi> and <hi>Florence</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> making them the earthly Paradise, had they beene acquainted with the new World and with <hi>Mexico,</hi> they would have recanted their untruths.</p>
               <p>Oh that the Lord were truely worshiped where hee hath powred forth the treasures of his goodnesse for the children of men! Oh that in that <hi>Eden</hi> the tempting and entising Serpent were not so much obeyed in the use of the faire seeming Apple of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, and the Lord that hath enriched it with such varieties so much neglected! How long O Lord God, how long shall the line of the wicked flourish, and the best portion be fallen to Idolaters and to the workers of iniquity?</p>
               <p>This City is the seat of an Archbishop, and of a Viceroy, who commonly is some great Noble man of <hi>Spain,</hi> whose power is to make Lawes and Ordinances, to give directions, and determine controversies, unlesse it bee in such great causes, which are thought fit to bee referred to the Councell of <hi>Spain.</hi> And though there bee about the Country many governments with severall Governours, yet they are all subordinate to this Viceroy, and there are at least foure hundred leagues of land all governed by the Princely seat of <hi>Mexico.</hi> Most of the Governours about the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try being the Viceroy his Creatures, placed by him, doe contribute great gifts and bribes for their preferment; so likewise doe all the rest whose right or wrong proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings depend upon the Viceroy his clemency and mercy in judging the daily appeales of Justice which come unto him. The King of <hi>Spain</hi> allowes him out of his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chequer yeerly a hundred thousand Duckats whilest hee governes; his time being but five yeers. But commonly with their bribes to the Courtiers of <hi>Spain,</hi> and to the Counsellours for the Estate of the <hi>India's</hi> they get a prorogation of five yeeres more, and sometimes of ten. It is incredible to think what this Viceroy may get a yeer in that place besides his hundred thousand duckats of rent, if hee bee a man covetous and given to trading, (as most of them are) for then they will bee Masters of what commodities they please, and none else shall deale in them but themselves; as did the Marquesse of <hi>Serralvo</hi> in my time, who was the best Monopolist of salt that ever those parts knew. This man was thought to get a Millian a yeer, what with gifts and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents, what with his Trading to <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Philippinas.</hi> He governed ten yeares, and in this time he sent to the King of <hi>Spain</hi> a <hi>Popingay</hi> worth half a Million, and in one year more he sent the worth of a Million to the Count of <hi>Olivares,</hi> and other <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> to obtain a prorogation for five yeers more. Besides the Viceroy there are commonly six Judges and a Kings Attorney, who are allowed out of the Kings Exchequer yeerly twelve thousand duckats a peice rent, besides two <hi>Alcaldes de Corts,</hi> or high Justices, who with the Viceroy judge all Chancery and criminall causes. But <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

they may oppose the Viceroy in any unlawfull and unjustifiable action, as some have done and have smarted for it, yet commonly they dare not. So that hee doth what he listeth, and it is enough for him to say, <hi>stat pro ratione voluntas.</hi> This power joyned with covetousnesse in the Viceroy, and therefore thousand duckats yeerly, joyned with pride in the Arch-bishop, was like to be the ruine of that City in the yeer 1624. Then was the Count of <hi>Gelves</hi> Viceroy, and <hi>Don Alonso de Zerna</hi> Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop, whose two powers striving and striking at one another like two flints, had almost brought to combustion that gallant City, and did set on fire the Viceroy his palace, and the prison joyning to it.</p>
               <p>The story was thus, which may be profitable for other nations, to beware of cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous governours, and proud Prelates; and therefore I thought fit to insert it here. The Count of <hi>Gelves</hi> was in some things one of the best Viceroys and Governours that ever the Court of <hi>Spaine</hi> sent to <hi>America,</hi> for he was called by the <hi>Spaniards, el terrible Iusticiero, y fuego de Ladiones,</hi> that is, terrible for Justice, and fire to consume all theeves. For he cleered all the high waies of theeves, hanging them as often as they were caught without mercy, and did send out troopes and officers to apprehend them, so that it was generally reported that since the conquest unto those dayes of his there had never been so many theeves and malefactors hanged up as in his time. So in all other points of justice he was severe and upright. But yet covetousnesse did so blind him to see his owne injustice, that before he could see it, he had brought the City of <hi>Mexico</hi> and the whole Kingdome to a danger of rebellion. What he would not to be seen in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, he acted by others his instruments. And one of them was one <hi>Don Pedro Mexia,</hi> a mighty rich Gentleman of <hi>Mexico,</hi> whom hee chose to joyne with him in monopoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing all the <hi>Indian</hi> Maiz, and wheat about the Countrey. <hi>Don Pedro Mexia</hi> of the <hi>Indians</hi> bought at the price he list their Maiz, and the wheat of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> he bought it accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that price at which it is taxed by the law of that land to be sold at in time of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine; which is at fourteen Rials a bushell, (which is not much there considering the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of gold and silver) at which price the Farmers and husbandmen knowing it to be a plentiful yeer were glad and willing to sel unto him their wheat, not knowing what the end would be, &amp; others fearing to gainsay him, whom they knew to be Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>royes favorite. Thus <hi>Don Pedro Mexia</hi> filled all his barnes which he had hired about the Countrey, and himselfe and the Viceroy became owners of all the wheat. He had his offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers appointed to bring it into the Markets upon his warning, and that was when some smal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> remnants that had escaped his fingers were sold, and the price raised. Then hoised he his price, and doubled it above what it had cost him. The poore began to complaine, the rich to murmure, the taxe of the law was moved in the Court of Chancery before the Viceroy. But he being privy to the Monopoly expounded the law to bee under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood in time of famine, and that he was informed, that it was as plentifull a yeer as ever had been, and that to his knowledge there was as much brought into the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets as ever had been, and plenty enough for <hi>Mexico</hi> and all the Countrey. Thus was the law slighted, the rich mocked, the poore oppressed, and none sold wheat but <hi>Don Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dro Mexia</hi> his officers for himselfe and the Viceroy. When Iustice would be no father, the people go to their mother the Church; &amp; having understood the businesse better, and that it was <hi>Don Pedro Mexia,</hi> who did tyrannnize and oppresse them with the Viceroy his favour, they intreat the Archbishop to make it a case of Conscience, and to reduce it to a Church censure. <hi>Don Alonfo de Zerna</hi> the Archbishop, who had alwaies stoma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cked <hi>Don Pedro Mexia</hi> and the Viceroy, to please the people, granted to them to excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate <hi>Don Pedro Mexia,</hi> and so sent out bils of excommunication to be fixed upon all the Church dores against <hi>Don Pedro;</hi> who not regarding the excommunication, and keeping close at home, and still selling his wheat, raising higher the price then it was before; the Arch-bishop raised this censure higher against him, adding to it a Bill of <hi>

                     </gap>,</hi> that is, a cessation from all divine service. This Censure is so great with them, that it is never used but for some great mans sake, who is contumacious and stubborn in his waies contemning the power of the Church. Then are all the Church dores shut up, (let the City be never so great) no masses are said, no prayers used, no preaching permitted, no meetings allowed for any publike devotion or cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling upon God. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

the Churches censure. And further whereas by this cessation <hi>à divinis,</hi> many Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and especially Cloisters suffer in the means of their livelyhood, who live upon what is daily given them for the Masses they say, and in a Cloister where thirty or fourty Preists say Masse, so many peices of Eight or crowns in <hi>Mexico</hi> doe daily come in; therefore this censure or <hi>cessatio à divinis</hi> is so inflicted upon the whole Church (all suffering for it as they say in spirituall, and some in temporall waies) that the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty offending or scandalizing, for whose sake this curse is laid upon all, is bound to satisfie all Preists and Cloisters which in the way aforesaid suffer, and to allow them so much out of his meanes, as they might have daily got by selling away their Masses for so many crownes for their daily livelyhood. To this would the Arch-bishop have brought <hi>Don Pedro Mexia,</hi> to have emptied out of his purse neer a thousand crownes daily, towards the maintenance of about a thousand Preists (so many there may bee in <hi>Mexico</hi>) who from the Altar sell away their bread-God to satisfie with bread and food their hungry stomackes. And secondly by the peoples suffering in their spirituall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, and non-communion of prayers and idolatrous worship, hee thought to make <hi>Don Pedro Mexia</hi> odious to the people. <hi>Don Pedro</hi> perceiving the spightfull intents of the Archbishop, and hearing the outcries of the people in the streets against him, and their cries for the use and liberty of their Churches, secretly retired himselfe to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace of the Viceroy, begging his favour and protection, for whose sake he suffered. The Viceroy immediately sent out his Orders, commanding the bills of excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and cessation <hi>à divinis</hi> to bee pulled from the Church dores, and to all the Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors of the Cloisters to set open their Churches, and to celebrate their service and mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses as formerly they had done. But they disobeying the Viceroy through blind obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to their Archbishop, the Viceroy commanded the Arch-prelate to revoke his cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures. But his answer was that what he had done, had been justly done against a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like offender and great oppressor of the poore, whose cries had moved him to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miserate their suffering condition, and that the offenders contempt of his first excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication had deserved the rigour of the second censure; neither of the which hee would or could revoke untill <hi>Don Pedro Mexia</hi> had submitted himselfe to the Church and to a publike absolution, and had satisfied the Preists and Cloisters who suffered for him, and had disclaimed that unlawfull and unconscionable Monopolie, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he wronged the whole common-wealth, and especially the poorer sort therein.</p>
               <p>Thus did that proud Prelate arrogantly in termes exalt himselfe against the the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of his Prince and Ruler, contemning his command with a flat deniall, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himself happy in imitating <hi>Ambrose</hi> his spirit against the Emperour <hi>Theod<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

But he could not flie so fast, but the Viceroy his care and vigilancy still eyed him, and with his Serjeants and Officers pursued him to <hi>Guadalupe,</hi> Which the Archbishop understanding, he betook himself to the sanctuary of the church, and there caused the candles to be lighted upon the Altar, the sacrament of his Bread-God to betaken out of the Tabernacle, and attiring himselfe with his Pontificall vesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, with his Mitre on his head, his Crozier in one hand, in the other he took his God of bread, and thus with his traine of Preists about him at the Altar, he waited for the coming of the Serjeants and Officers, whom he thought with his God in his hand, and with a Here I am, to astonish and amaze, and to make them as Christ the Jewes in the garden, to fall backwards, and to disable them from laying hands upon him.

Master the Viceroy was excommunicated he looked upon him as one out of the pale of the Church, and one without any power, or authority to command him in the house of God, and so required them as they tendered the good of their soules to depart peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably, and not to infringe the priviledges and immunity of the Church, by exercising in it any legall act of secular power and command; and that he would not goe out of the Chruch, unlesse they durst take him and the Sacrament together. With this the head officer named <hi>Tiroll,</hi> stood up and notified unto him an order in the Kings name to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend his person in what place soever he should find him, and to guard him to the Port of <hi>St. Iohn de Ulhua,</hi> and there to deliver him to whom by further order he should be directed there, to be shipped for <hi>Spain</hi> as a Traitour to the Kings crowne, a troubler of the common peace, an author and mover of sedition in the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth. The Arch-bishop smiling upon <hi>Tiroll</hi> answered him, Thy Master useth too high termes; and words which doe better agree unto himselfe; for I know no mutiny or sedition like to trouble the Common-wealth, unlesse it bee by his and <hi>Don Pedro Mexia</hi> his oppressing of the poore. And as for thy guarding mee to <hi>St. Iohn de Ulhua,</hi> I conjure thee by Jesus Christ whom thou knowest I hold in my hands, not to use here any violence in Gods house, from whose Altar I am resolved not to depart; take heed God punish thee not as he did <hi>Ieroboam</hi> for stretching forth his hand at the Altar against the Prophet; let his withered hand remind thee of thy duty. But <hi>Tiroll</hi> suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him not to squander away the time and ravell it out with further preaching, but called to the Altar a Preist whom he had brought for that purpose, and commanded him in the Kings name to take the Sacrament out of the Arch-bishops hand; which the Preist doing, the Arch-bishop unvested himselfe of his Pontificals, and (though with many repetitions of the Churches immunity) yeelded himselfe unto <hi>Tiroll,</hi> and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king his leave of all his Prebends, requiring them to bee witnesses of what had been done, he went prisoner to <hi>St. Iohn de Ulhua,</hi> where he was delivered to the custody of the Governour of the Castle, and not many daies after was sent in a ship prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for that purpose to <hi>Spaine</hi> to the King and Councell, with a full charge of all his carriages and misdemeanours.

no sooner was hee got into the Viceroy his house, and the gates shut up, but there were gathered to the Market place (as I was credibly informed by those that saw and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served diligently that daies trouble) above two thousand people, all of inferiour rank and quality; and yet the number still increased till they were judged to bee about six or seven thousand. They all cried out for <hi>Tiroll</hi> the <hi>Iudas,</hi> sparing neither stones nor dirt which they did fling at the Palace windowes.</p>
               <p>The Viceroy sent a message to them desiring them to be quiet, and to betake them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to their houses, certifying them that <hi>Tiroll</hi> was not in his Palace, but escaped out of a back doore. The rude multitude would not bee satisfied with this, being now set on by two or three Priests who were joyned with them, and so they began more violently to batter the Palace gates and walls, having brought pikes, and holbards, and long poles; others had got a few Pistols, and birding Peeces, wherewith they shot, not caring whom they killed or wounded in the Palace. It was wonderfull to see that none of the better sort, none of the Judges, no high Justice, no inferiour Officers durst or would come out to suppresse the multitude, or to assist the Viceroy being in so great danger; nay I was told by some shopkeepers who lived in the Market place, that they made a laughing businesse of it, and the people that passed by went smiling and saying, Let the boyes and youngsters alone, they will wright our wrongs, they will find out before they have done, both <hi>Tiroll</hi> and <hi>Mexia</hi> and him that protects them, meaning the Viceroy; but amongst them was much noted one Priest, named <hi>Salazar,</hi> who spent much shot and bullets, and more his spirits in running about to spie some place of advantage, which hee might soonest batter downe. They found it seemes the prison doores easier to open, or else with helpe within they opened them, and let out all the malefactors, who joyned with them to assault the Palace. The Viceroy seeing no helpe came to him from the City, from his friends, from the Judges of the Chancery, from the Kings high Justices, nor other Officers for the peace, went up to the <hi>Zoties</hi> of his Palace with his Guard and Servants that attended on him, and set up the Royall Standard, and caused a Trumpet to bee sounded to call the City to ayde and assist their King. But this prevailed not, none stirred, all the chief of the City kept within doores. And when the multitude saw the Royall Standard out, and heard the Kings name from the <hi>Zoties,</hi> they cryed out, and often repeated it, <hi>Viva el Rex, mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erael mal govierno, mueran los des comulgados,</hi> that is to say, Our King live long, but let the evill government die, and perish, and let them die that are excommunicated. These words saved many of them from hanging afterwards, when the businesse was tried and searched into by <hi>Don Martinde Carrillo.</hi> And with these words in their mouths, they skirmished with them of the <hi>Zoties</hi> at least three houres, they above hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling downe stones, and they beneath hurling up to them and some shooting with a few Pistols and birding peeces at one another: and marke that in all this bitter skir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish there was not a peece of Ordnance shot, for the Viceroy had none for the defence of his Palace or Person, neither had or hath that great City any for its strength and security, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> living fearelesse of the <hi>Indians,</hi> and (as they thinke) secure from being annoyed by any forraine Nation. There were slain in about six houres in all that this tumult lasted, seven or eight beneath in the Market place, and one of the Viceroy his Guard and a page in the <hi>Zoties</hi> above. The day drawing to an end, the multitude brought pitch and fire, and first fired the prison, then they set on fire part of the Palace, and burnt downe the chief gate. This made some of the City, of the Gentry, and of the Judges to come out, lest the fire should pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile farre upon the City, and to perswade the people to desist, and to quench the fire. Whilest the fire was quenching, many got into the Palace, some fell upon the Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>royes stables, and there got part of his mules and horses rich furnitures, others began to fall upon some chests, others to teare down the hangings, but they were soone perswaded by the better sort of the City, to desist from spoile or robbery, lest by that they should bee discovered; other searched about for <hi>Don Pedro Mexia,</hi> for <hi>Tiroll</hi> and the Viceroy. None of them could bee found, having disguised themselves and so escaped. Whither <hi>Don Pedro Mexia</hi> and <hi>Tiroll</hi> went, it could not bee knowen in many dayes; but certaine it was that the Viceroy disguised himselfe in a Franciscan habit, and so in company of a Fryer went through the multitude to the Cloister of the Franciscans, where hee abode all that yeer, (and there I saw him the yeere after) not daring to come out, untill hee had informed the King and Counsell of <hi>Spain,</hi>
                  <pb n="66" facs="tcp:53246:39"/>
with what hath happened, and of the danger himselfe and the City was in, if not timely prevented. The King and Counsell of <hi>Spain</hi> took the businesse to considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and looked upon it as a warning peece, to a further mutiny and rebellion, and an example to other parts of <hi>America</hi> to follow upon any such like occasion, if some punishment were not inflicted upon the chief offendors. Wherefore the yeere following 1625. which was when I went to those parts, the King sent a new Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roy the Marques of <hi>Serralvo</hi> to govern in the place of the Conut of <hi>Gelues,</hi> and especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to aid and assist <hi>Don Martin de Carrillo</hi> a Priest, and Inquisitor of the Inquisition of <hi>Valladolid,</hi> who was sent with large Commission and authority to examine the foresaid tumult and mutiny, and to judge all offenders that should be found in it, yea and to hang up such as should deserve death. I was at <hi>Mexico</hi> in the best time of the tryall, and had intelligence from <hi>Don Martin de Carrillo</hi> his owne Ghostly father a Dominican Fryer of the chief passages in the examination of the businesse; and the result was, that if Justice should have beene executed rightly, most of the prime of <hi>Mexico</hi> would have suffered, for not comming in to the Royall Standard, when cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by the sound of the Trumpet; the Judges some were put out of their places, though they answered that they durst not stirre out, for that they were informed that all the City would have risen against them if they had appeared in publick. The chief actors were found to bee the Criolians or Natives of the Countrey, who doe hate the <hi>Spanish</hi> Government, and all such as come from <hi>Spain;</hi> and reason they have for it, for by them they are much oppressed, as I have before observed, and are and will bee al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes watching any opportunity to free themselves from the <hi>Spanish</hi> yoke. But the chief fomenters of the mutiny were found to bee the Bishops party the Preists; and so had not <hi>Salazar</hi> and three more of them fled, they had certainly been sent to the Gallies of <hi>Spain</hi> for Galley slaves; this judgment was published against them. There were not above three or foure hanged of so many thousands, and their condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was for things which they had stollen out of the Viceroys Palace. And because further inquiry into the rebellion would have brought in atleast half the City either for actors, or counsellors, or fomentors, the King was well advised to grant a generall pardon. The Archbishops proceedings were more disliked in the Court of <hi>Spain,</hi> then the Viceroyes, and was long without any preferment; though, at last that there might be no exceptions taken by his party, nor cause given for a further stirring the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers to a greater combustion, the Councel thought fit to honor him in those parts where hee was born; and to make him Bishop of <hi>Zamora</hi> a small Bishoprick in <hi>Castile;</hi> so that his wings were clipt, and from Archbishop hee came to bee but Bishop, and from threescore thousand Crownes yeerely rent he fell to foure or five thousand onely a yeere. The count of <hi>Gelues</hi> was also sent to <hi>Spain,</hi> and well entertained in the Court, and therein made Master of the Kings horse, which in <hi>Spain</hi> is a Noblemans preferment.</p>
               <p>And this History shewing the state and condition of <hi>Mexico,</hi> when I travelled to those parts I have willingly set down, that the Reader may by it bee furnished with better observations then my self (who am but a Neophyte) am able to deduct. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what might bee observed from the Viceroyes covetousnesse; which doubtlesse in all is a great sinne, for as <hi>Paul</hi> well adviseth, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 10. <hi>The love of mony is the root of all evill;</hi> but much more to bee condemned in a Prince or Governour; whom it may blind in the exercise of Justice and Judgment, and harden those tender bowels (which ought to bee in him) of a father and shepheard to his flock and children. Wee may yet from this Viceroyes practice and example against a chiefe head of the <hi>Romish</hi> Church, discover that errour of the Preists and Jesuites of <hi>England,</hi> who perswade the people here that no temporall Magistrate hath power over them, and that to lay hands on them in wrath and anger (being as they say Consecrated to God and his Altar) is <hi>ipso facto</hi> a deep excommunication; whereas wee see the contrary in this Viceroy a member of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and yet exercising his temporall power against an Arch-Bishop, and by <hi>Tiroll</hi> taking him from the Church, and as his prisoner sending him with just wrath and anger to a forraine and remote place of banishment. But lastly it is my desire that the High and Honorable Court of Parliament which now is sitting for the good of this Kingdome, and for the good of it hath already pulled downe the Hierarchy of such Prelates and Archprelates, would looke upon the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and uproare which the keys of the Church in the hand of an undiscreet Preist
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:53246:39"/>
brought upon that City of <hi>Mexico.</hi> Certainly as the strength of the Church well setled, and governed with subordination to the Magistrate, is likewise the strength of the Common-wealth; so on the other side the power of the Keyes in the Clergies hand to cast out what incestuous <hi>Corinthian</hi> they please, without the rest of the <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians</hi> consent, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 4, 5. may prove dangerous and troublesome to the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weale and good. For if the Clergy may use by itselfe, without the overseeing eye of the Magistrates Commissioners, the power of the keyes; who shall bee free from their censures, that any way will oppose them? The poor and ignorant will not onely bee the object of their censures, but the rich and wise and noble, Ruler and Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate will also come under their censures; wherein I finde a Minister may then as a Pope encroach upon the highest Crowne of an Emperour. Nay certainly in <hi>England</hi> the thoughts of some such aspiring Ministers have been higher then the thoughts of this Arch-Bishop of <hi>Mexico</hi> over a Viceroy, the conceipt of their power with the Keyes have hoised them above their Prince, for I have heard one of them say, he knew not but that by the power of the keyes hee might as well excommunicate the King as any other private person. This conceit hath made the Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> feare no earthly Prince, Emperour, Ruler or Magistrate; nay this hath made him to bee feared and respected and honoured by Kings and Princes; And why may not the same power in the hands of a Protestant Clergy, make the meanest and the highest to feare and dread them? But some will say, the Word of God being the Touchstone wherewith they are to try what points may be the subjects of their censures, by such a light and gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance they are not like to erre. But they then being themselves the Judges of the sense and meaning of the Word, who shall oppose their judgment, and their ensuing cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures? What if to their triall and judgment they shall bring any Law enacted by a High Court of Parliament, and shall judge it not according to the Word of God, and so presse it to the peoples consciences; threatning with their censures such as shall obey it? in such a case how may the power of the keyes unlock and open a doore to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of rebellion against their lawfull Magistrates? Oh what dangers may befall a Common-wealth, when thus the Clergy shall stand over poor and rich, Subject and Magistrate, as <hi>Peters</hi> statue at <hi>Rome,</hi> with Crosse-keyes in his hand? What a rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on did the Archbishop of <hi>Mexico</hi> cause by excommunicating <hi>Don Pedro Mexia</hi> first, and then the Viceroy? and how did the people fear his keyes more then their Viceroys temporall power and authority, siding with him against such as hee had excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated? What troubles did that Doctor <hi>Smith</hi> Bishop of <hi>Chalcedon</hi> bring among the Papists, small and great ones, not long agoe here in <hi>England,</hi> laying upon them by the power of the Keyes a censure of Excommunication, if they confessed to, or did en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaine and heare the Masse of any, that had not derived their authority from him? Then were they in open rebellion one against another; the secular Preists against the Monkes, Fryers, and Jesuites, and the Laity all troubled, some siding with one, and some with another, untill Doctor <hi>Smith</hi> having thus kindled the fire, was faine to leave it burning, and to betake himself to <hi>Paris,</hi> and from thence to foment the dissen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which with power of the Keyes hee had caused here.</p>
               <p>Oh surely the Church so far is a good Mother, as it allowes a Magistrate to be a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And great comfort have those that live within the pale of the Church, to know that they have the Magistrate a Father to flye unto in their pressures and discomforts.</p>
               <p>I must ingenuously confesse that one maine point that brought me from the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> was the too too great power of the Keyes in the Popes, Bishops, and Preists hands, who studying more selfe Policy, then common Policy, looke upon the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and with their power deale with them more as their subjects, then as politicall Members in a Common-wealth, rending and tearing them daily by their censures from that common and Politicall body to which they belong, without any hopes of care to bee had of them by their Magistrate and Politicall head and Governour. And I hope I shall not have fled from Antichrist who exalteth himself as head of the Church, and from that power hath his influence over all State and Politicall Heads and Rulers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to find in a Protestant Church any of his spirit, making a distinction of a spirituall and temporall head, forgetting the onely head Christ Jesus; which were it once grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as the spirit is more noble then the body, so would the inference soon bee made, that they that are over the spirit, are higher in power then they that are over the body; which conclusion would soon bring <hi>Mexic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

in all my travails by sea and land, in most parts of <hi>Europe</hi> and of <hi>America,</hi> hath ever taught mee, that where the Clergy hath been too much exalted and enjoyed power o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the people, there the Common-wealth hath soon fallen into heavy pressures and troubles. And let not this my observation seem strange as coming from a Minister, for I have learned from Christ, <hi>Matth.</hi> 20. 25, 26, 27. <hi>That the Princes of the Gentiles exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise Dominion, and they that are great exercise authority. But it shall not bee so among you, but whosoever will bee great among you, let him bee your Minister; and whosoever will bee chiefe among you, let him be your Servant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I hope the High Court of Parliament will so settle the Church and State here that this shall not feare any further troubles from that; and that wee who have our portion from the one, may bee Ministers and Servants under the Commissioners of the other. And thus largely I have described the State and condition of <hi>Mexico</hi> in the time of <hi>Montezuma,</hi> and since his death the manner and proportion of it, with the troubled condition I found it in when I went thither, by reason of a mutiny and rebellion caused by an Arch-Bishop the yeer before. I shall now come out of <hi>Mexico,</hi> and present unto you the places most remarkable about it; and from thence the severall parts and Countries of <hi>America,</hi> before I betake my self to the journey which I made from <hi>Mexico</hi> to <hi>Guatemala,</hi> lying nine hundred <hi>English</hi> miles Southward, and from thence yet to <hi>Costarica,</hi> and <hi>Nicoya,</hi> being nine hundred miles further towards the South.</p>

The chief division therefore of this greatest part of the World, is twofold onely, to wit, the <hi>Mexicans,</hi> and the <hi>Peruan</hi> parts, which containe many great and sundry Provinces and Countries, some as big as our whole Kingdom of <hi>England.</hi> But <hi>Mexico</hi> giving name to halfe <hi>America,</hi> is now called <hi>Nova Hispania,</hi> new <hi>Spain,</hi> from whence the Kings of <hi>Spain</hi> doe stile themselves, <hi>Hispania<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

The <hi>Peruan</hi> part containeth all the Southern Tract, and is tyed to the <hi>Mexican</hi> by the <hi>Isthmus</hi> or strait of <hi>Darien,</hi> being no more then 17. or as others say, in the narrowest place but 12. miles broad from the North to the South Sea. And many have mentioned to the Councell of <hi>Spain,</hi> the cutting of a Navigable Channell through this small <hi>Isthmus,</hi> so to shorten the Voiage to <hi>China,</hi> and the <hi>Moluccoes.</hi> But the Kings of <hi>Spain</hi> have not as yet attemped to doe it, some say lest in the worke hee should lose those few <hi>Indians</hi> that are left (would to God it were so that they were and had been so carefull and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever this hath not been attempted by the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> they give not for reason any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary great charge, for that would soone bee recompensed with the speedy and easie conveying that way the Commodities from South to North Seas. This <hi>Peruan</hi> part of <hi>America</hi> containeth these Countries, or Kingdomes, to wit, <hi>Castella au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rea, Guiana, Peru, Brasil, Chille;</hi> and the compasse of it is seventeen thousand miles. I shall not speake distinctly of all these parts, which better writers, and of more know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge

have before me discovered; and because some of them being out of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> reach and dominion, from whom I have received my best intelligence, I have from them had little notice of them, nor experience, which indeed I intend to make my best guide in this my worke. Therefore to returne again to the <hi>Mexican</hi> part, and the Northern Tract, I shall fall again upon the first and chiefe member of that division, which I said was <hi>Mexico.</hi> This aboundeth with golden sanded rivers, in which are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Crocodiles (though not so big at those of <hi>Egypt</hi>) which the <hi>Indian</hi> people eat. It glorieth in the mountaines <hi>Popochampeche,</hi> and <hi>Popocatepec,</hi> which are of the same nature with <hi>Aetna</hi> and <hi>Vesuvius.</hi> Nay all the way South-ward as farre as <hi>Leon</hi> in <hi>Nica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragua,</hi> there are many of these fiery mountaines. But <hi>Popocatepec</hi> is one of the chiefe of them, which signifieth a hill of smoake, for many times it casteth out smoake and fire; it standeth eight leagues from <hi>Chololla;</hi> the ascending up unto it is very troublesome, and full of craggie rocks. When <hi>Cortez</hi> passed that way to <hi>Mexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co,</hi> he sent ten <hi>Spaniards</hi> to view it, with many <hi>Indians</hi> to carry their victuals, and to guide them in the way. They approached so nigh the top, that they heard such a ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible noyse which proceeded from thence, that they durst not goe unto it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for the ground did tremble and shake, and great quantity of ashes did much disturb their way. But yet two of them who seemed to be most hardie, and desirous to see strange things, went up to the top, because they would not return with a sleevelesse answer, and that they might not be accounted cowards, leaving their fellowes behind them, proceeded forwards, and passed through that desart of ashes, and at length came under a great smoake very thick, and standing there a while, the darknesse vanished partly away, and then appeared the Vulcan and concavity, which is about halfe a league in compasse; out of the which the aire came rebounding with a very great noise, very shrill and whist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, so that the whole hill did tremble; it was like unto an oven where glasse is made. The smoake and heat was so great that they could not abide it, and of force were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained to return by the way that they had ascended. But they were not gone farre; when the Vulcan began to flash out flames of fire, ashes and embers, yea and at the last stones of burning fire, and if they had not chanced to find a rocke, under which they shadowed themselves, undoubtedly they had there been burned. It is like unto the Vulcan of <hi>Sicilia,</hi> it is high and round, and never wanteth snow about some part of it. Before the coming of <hi>Cortez</hi> for ten yeers space it had left off expelling vapour or smoake; but in the yeer 1540. it began again to burn, and with the horrible noyse thereof, the people that dwelt four leagues from it were terrified; the ashes that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded then from it reached to <hi>Tlaxcallan,</hi> which standeth ten leagues distant from it; yea some affirme that it extended fifteen leagues distant, and burned the herbs in the gardens, the corne in the fields, and clothes that lay a drying. And many such hils and mountaines doth this <hi>Mexican</hi> part of <hi>America,</hi> or new <hi>Spaine</hi> abound with. The li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits of it are on the East, <hi>Iucatan,</hi> and the gulfe of <hi>Mexico,</hi> on the West <hi>Californio,</hi> on the South the <hi>Peruan</hi> part. The Northern bounds are unknowne, so that we cannot certainly avow this <hi>America</hi> to be continent, nor certainly affirme it to be an Island, distiugnished from the old world. It was very populous before the arrivall of the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards,</hi> who in seventeen yeers slew six millions of them, roasting some, plucking out the eyes, cutting off the arms of others, and casting them living to be devoured of wilde beasts. This chiefe Province of <hi>America</hi> named <hi>Mexico,</hi> is further subdivided into four parts, that is to say, <hi>Themistitan, Nova Galicia, Mechoacan,</hi> and <hi>Guasta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ehan. Themistitan</hi> is the greatest and noblest of these foure; for that it containeth six Cities, and of them one is <hi>Mexico,</hi> which giveth name to the halfe part of <hi>America,</hi> and is the seat of an Arch-bishop, and of the <hi>Spanish</hi> Viceroy, whose greatnesse with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I have before laid open; the second City is <hi>La Puebla de los Angeles,</hi> the City of Angels; the third <hi>Villar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

There is a sumptuous palace built with many fair gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens, and devises of waters, and ponds of fish, whither the Viceroyes and the gentry of <hi>Mexico</hi> do resort for their recreation. The riches here belonging to the Viceroyes Chappell are thought to be worth above a million of crownes.</p>

                  <hi>Taenba</hi> is also a pleasant Towne full of orchards and gardens, in the very way to <hi>Chapultepec.</hi> South-ward is <hi>Toluco,</hi> rich also for trading, but above all much mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for the Bacon, which is the best of all those parts, and is transported far and neer. West-ward is the Towne called, <hi>La Piedad</hi> at the end of a Cawsey, whither the people much resort from <hi>Mexico,</hi> being drawn to the superstitious worship of a picture of <hi>Mary,</hi> which hath been enriched by the chiefe of <hi>Mexico</hi> with many thousand pounds worth of gifts of chaines, and crownes of gold.</p>
               <p>But more Northwest-ward three leagues from <hi>Mexico</hi> is the pleasantest place of all that are about <hi>Mexico,</hi> called <hi>La Soledad,</hi> and by others <hi>el desierto,</hi> the solitary or desert place and wildernesse. Were all wildernesses like it, to live in a wildernesse would be better then to live in a City. This hath been a device of poor Fryers named discalced, or barefooted Carmelites, who to make shew of their hypocriticall and apparent god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse, and that whilst they would be thought to live like Eremites, retired from the world, they may draw the world unto them; they have built there a stately Cloister, which being upon a hill and among rocks makes it to be more admired. About the Cloister they have fashioned out many holes and Caves in, under, and among the rocks, like Eremites lodgings, with a room to lie in, and an Oratory to pray in, with pictures, and Images, and rare devices for mortification, as disciplines of wyar, rods of iron, haire-cloths, girdles with sharp wyar pointes to girdle about their bare flesh, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny such like toyes which hang about their Oratories, to make people admire their mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified and holy lives. All these Eremeticall holes and caves (which are some ten in all) are within the bounds and compasse of the Cloister) and among orchards and gardens full of fruits and flowers, which may take up two miles compasse; and here among the rockes are many springs of water, which with the shade of the plantins and other trees, are most coole and pleasant to the Eremites; they have also the sweet smell of the rose and jazmin, which is a little flower, but the sweetest of all others; there is not any other flower to be found that is rare and exquisite in that countrey, which is not in that wildernesse to delight the senses of those mortified Eremites. They are weekly changed from the Cloister, and when their weeke is ended, others are sent, and they return unto their Cloister; they carry with them their bottles of wine, sweet-meats, and other provision; as for fruits the trees about do drop them into their mouthes. It is wonderfull to see the strange devises of fountains of water which are about the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens; but much more strange and wonderfull to see the resort of Coaches, and gallants, and Ladies, and Citizens from <hi>Mexico</hi> thither, to walke and make merry in those desart pleasures, and to see those hypocrites, whom they looke upon as living Saints, and so think nothing too good for them, to cherish them in their desart conflicts with Satan. None goes to them but carries some sweet-meats, or some other dainty dish to nourish and feed them withall; whose prayers they likewise earnestly solicite, leaving them great almes of mony for their masses; and above all, offering to a picture in their Church, called our Lady of <hi>Carmel,</hi> treasures of diamonds, pearles, golden chaines and crownes, and gownes of cloth of gold and silver. Before this picture did hang in my time twenty lampes of silver; the worst of them being worth a hundred pound; true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Satan hath given unto them what he offered Christ in the desart, All these things wil I give thee if thou wilt fall down and worship me; all the dainties and of all the riches of <hi>America</hi> hath he given unto them in that their desart, for that they daily fall downe and worship him.

               <p>Next to this is the Province of <hi>Guastachan,</hi> which lieth in the rode from <hi>St. Iohn de Ulbua</hi> to <hi>Mexico,</hi> which is not so poore as <hi>Heylin</hi> maketh it, for that now it doth abound with many rich farmes of Sugar, and of Cochinil, and reacheth as farre as the Valley

of <hi>Guaxaca</hi> which is a most rich place. The chiefe City of this Province was wont to be <hi>Tlaxcallan,</hi> whereof I have formerly spoken; but now the City of <hi>Guaxaca</hi> which is a Bishops seat, and <hi>Xalappa</hi> which is also of late made a Bishops seat, makes it more famous. glories also in <hi>Villa Rica</hi> a Port Towne very wealthy, because all the traffique betwixt the Old and New <hi>Spains</hi> do passe through it. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> have in it two rich Colonies, called <hi>Pamico,</hi> and <hi>St. Iames</hi> in the valleys. The third Province of <hi>Mexico</hi> is called <hi>Mechoacan,</hi> which containeth in circuit fourscore leagues. It is also an exceeding rich countrey, abounding in Mulberry trees, silk, hony, wax, black-amber, works of divers coloured feathers, most rich, rare, and exquisite, and such store of fish, that from thence it tooke its name, <hi>Mechuoucan,</hi> which signifieth a place of fishing.</p>
               <p>The language of the <hi>Indians</hi> is most elegant and copious, and they tall, strong, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive, and of very good wits, as may be seen in all their workes, but especially in those of feathers, which are so curious, that they are presented for rich presents to the King and Nobles of <hi>Spaine.</hi> The chiefe City of this Province is <hi>Valladolid</hi> a Bishops<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seat; and the best Townes are <hi>Sinsonte,</hi> which was the residence of the Kings of this countrey. There is also <hi>Pascuar</hi> and <hi>Colima</hi> very great Townes inhabited by <hi>Indians</hi> and <hi>Spaniards.</hi> There are also two good havens, called <hi>St. Anthony,</hi> and <hi>St. Iames,</hi> or <hi>Santiago.</hi> This country of <hi>Mechoacan</hi> was almost as great as the Empire of <hi>Mexico,</hi> when <hi>Cortez</hi> conquered those parts. The King that was then of <hi>Mechoacan</hi> was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Caconzin,</hi> who was a great friend unto <hi>Cortez,</hi> and a servitor to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and willingly yeelded himselfe as vassall to the King of <hi>Spaine;</hi> yet such was the cruelty of <hi>Don Nunio de Guzman,</hi> the first Ruler and President of the Chancery of <hi>Mexico</hi> after the conquest, that understanding he was put out of his office, he tooke his journey against the <hi>Teuchichimecas,</hi> and carried in his company five hundred <hi>Spaniards,</hi> with whom and six thousand <hi>Indians</hi> which by force he tooke out of <hi>Mechoacan,</hi> he conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <hi>Xalixco</hi> which is now called the new <hi>Galicia.</hi> And as for this purpose hee passed through <hi>Mechoacan,</hi> he tooke prisoner the King <hi>Caconzin,</hi> (who was quiet and peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and stirred not against him) and tooke from him ten thousand markes of plate, and much gold and other treasure, and afterwards burned him, and many other <hi>Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian</hi> Gentlemen and principall persons of that Kingdome, because they should not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine, saying that a dead dog biteth not. They were in this Kingdome as superstiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and idolatrous as in the rest of <hi>America.</hi> No divorcement was permitted amongst them, except the party made a solemn oath, that they looked not the one on the other stedfastly and directly at the time of their marriage. In the burying likewise of their Kings they were superstitious, cruell, and Idolatrous. When any King of <hi>Mechoa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can</hi> happened to be brought to such extremity of sicknesse that hope of life was past; then did he name and appoint which of his sons should inherit the state and Crown, and being known the new King or heir presently sent for all the Governours, Captains, and valiant souldiers, who had any office or charge, to come unto the buriall of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and he that came not, from thenceforth was held for a Traitour, and so puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed. When the death of the old King was certaine, then came all degrees of estates, and did bring their presents to the new King for the approbation of his Kingdome: But if the King were not throughly dead, but at the point of death, then the gates were shut in, and none permitted to enter; and if he were throughly dead, then be gan a generall cry and mourning, and they were permitted to come where their dead King lay, and to touch him with their hands.

odious for a thing of immortall glory. First six Gentlewomen of noble birth were appointed to die; the one to have the office of keeper of his jewels, which he was wont to weare; another for the office of cup-bearer; another to give him water with a bason and Ewer; another to give him alwaies the Urinall; another to be his Cooke; and another to serve for Landress. They slew also many women, slaves, and free-maidens for to attend upon the Gentlewomen, and moreover one of every occupation within the City. When all these that were appointed to die were washed, and their bellies full with meat and drinke, then they painted their faces yellow, and put garlands of sweet flowers upon each of their heads. Then they went in order of procession before the Beere, whereon the dead King was carried; some went playing on instruments made of Snail shells, and others played upon bones and shells of Sea Tortois, others went whistling, and the most part weeping. The sons of the dead King and other Noble men carried upon their shoulders the Beere where the Corps lay, and proceeded with an ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie pace towards the Temple of the God called <hi>Curicaveri;</hi> his kinsmen went round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Beer singing a sorrowfull song. The officers and houshold-servants of the Court, with other Magistrates and Rulers of justice bare the Standards and divers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Arms. And about midnight they departed in the order aforesaid out of the Kings Palace with great light of fire-brands, and with a heavy noyse of their trumpets and drummes. The Citizens which dwelt where the Corse passed, attended to make clean the street. And when they were come to the Temple, they went four times round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout a great fire which was prepared of Pine tree to burn the dead body. Then the Beer was laid upon the fire, and in the meane while that the body was burning, they mawled with a club those which had the garlands, and afterward buried them four and four as they were apparelled behind the Temple. The next day in the morning the ashes, bones and jewels were gathered and laid upon a rich mantle, the which was carried to the Temple gate, where the Preists attended to blesse those divellish reliques, whereof they made a dow or paste, and thereof an Image, which was apparelled like a man, with a visor on his face, and all other sorts of jewels that the dead King was wont to weare, so that it seemed a gallant Idoll. At the foot of the Temple staires they opened a grave ready made, which was square, large, two fadome deepe, it was also hanged with new mats round about, and a faire bed therein, in the which one of the Preists placed the Idoll made of ashes with his eyes towards the East part, and did hang round about the walls Targets of gold and silver, with bowes and arrows, and many gallant tuffes of feathers with earthen vessels, as pots, dishes, and platters, so that the grave was filled up with houshold-stuffe, chests covered with leather, apparell, Jewels, meate drinke and armour. This done, the grave was shut up and made sure with beames, boardes, and floored with earth on the top. All those Gentlemen who had served or touched any thing in the buriall, washed themselves and went to dinner in the Court or yard of the Kings house without any table, and having dined they wiped their hands upon certain lockes of Cotton-wooll, hanging downe their heads, and not speaking any word, except it were to aske for drinke. This ceremonie endured five daies, and in all that time no fire was permitted to be kindled in the City, except in the Kings house and Temples, nor yet any corne was ground, or market kept, nor any durst goe out of their houses, shewing all the sorrow that might be possible for the death of their King. And this was the superstitious manner of burying the Kings of <hi>Mechoacan.</hi> This people did punish adultery most rigorously; for to commit it was death as well for the man as the wom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

But if the adulterer were a Gentleman, his head was decked with fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and after that he was hanged, and his body burned; and for this offence was no pardon, either for man or woman. But for avoiding of adultery they did permit o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther common wom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

They are valiant <hi>Indians,</hi> and hold the <hi>Spaniards</hi> hard to it; and have great advantage against them in the rocks and mountaines, where they abide and cut off many <hi>Spaniards.</hi> Their chief weapons are but bowes and arrowes, and yet with them from the thick Woods, hils and rockes they annoy and offend the <hi>Spaniards</hi> exceedingly. I have heard some <hi>Spaniards</hi> say that they flie and climbe up the rocks like Goates; and when they draw nigh unto them, then they cry out with a hideous noise shooting their arrowes at them, and in an instant are departed and fled unto another rock. The reson why the <hi>Spaniards</hi> are so earnest to pursue and conquer these <hi>Indians,</hi> more then many others of <hi>America,</hi> which as yet are not brought in subjection to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> is for the many Mines of silver and treasure of gold which they know to bee there. They have got already sure possession o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

But the further the <hi>Spaniards</hi> goe to the North, still more riches they discover; and faine would they subdue all those Northern parts (as I have heard them say) lest our <hi>English</hi> from <hi>Virginia,</hi> and their other plantations, get in before them. I have heard them won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that our <hi>English</hi> enter no further into the maine land; surely say they, either they feare the <hi>Indians,</hi> or else with a little paultry Tobacco they have as much as will maintaine them in lazinesse. Certainly they intend to conquer through those heathen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish <hi>Indians;</hi> untill by land they come to <hi>Florida</hi> and <hi>Virginia,</hi> (for so they boast) if they bee not met with by some of our Northern Nations of <hi>Europe,</hi> who may better keep them off then those poor <hi>Indians,</hi> and may doe God greater and better service with those rich Mines, then the <hi>Spaniards</hi> hitherto have done.</p>
               <p>Thus having spoken somewhat of the foure Provinces of <hi>Mexico,</hi> which was the first member of the division <hi>Mexican</hi> and <hi>Peruan;</hi> Now I shall briefly say somewhat further of three more Countries belonging to the <hi>Mexican</hi> or Northern Tract as op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite to the <hi>Peruan,</hi> omiting <hi>Florida, Virginia, Norumbega, Nova Francia Corterialis,</hi> and <hi>Estotilandia,</hi> because I will not write as many doe by relation and hearsay, but by more sure intelligence, insight and experience. In my first division next to <hi>Mexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co,</hi> I placed <hi>Quivira, I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

And indeed the <hi>Indians</hi> of <hi>America</hi> in many things seeme to bee of the race and progenie of the <hi>Tartars,</hi> in that <hi>Quivira</hi> and all the Westside of the Country towards <hi>Asia</hi> is farre more populous then the East towards <hi>Europe,</hi> which sheweth these parts to have been first inhabited. Secondly, their uncivility, and barbarous properties tell us that they are most like the <hi>Tartars</hi> of any. Thirdly, the West side of <hi>America</hi> if it bee not continent with <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary,</hi> is yet disjoyned by a small straight. Fourthly, the people of <hi>Quivira</hi> neerest to <hi>Tartary,</hi> are said to follow the seasons and pasturing of their cattell like the <hi>Tartari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</hi> All this side of <hi>America</hi> is full of herbage, and injoyeth a temperate aire. The people are desirous of glasse more then of gold; and in some places to this day are Cannibals. The chief riches of this Country are their Kine, which are to them as we say of our Ale to drunkards, meat, drink and cloth, and more too. For the Hides yeeld them houses, or at least the coverings of them; their bones bodkins, their hair thred, their finews ropes; their horns, mawes and bladders, vessels; their dung, fire; their Calve skinnes, budgets to draw and keepe water; their blood, drink; their flesh, meat.</p>
               <p>There is thought to bee some traffique from <hi>China,</hi> or <hi>Cathaya,</hi> hither to those parts, where as yet the <hi>Spaniards</hi> have not entred. For when <hi>Uazquez de Coronado</hi> conquered some part of it, hee saw in the further Sea certaine ships, not of common making, which seemed to bee well laden, and bare in their prowes, Pelicans, which could not bee conjectured to come from any Country, but one of these two. In <hi>Quivira</hi> there are but two Provinces knowne unto us, which are <hi>Cibola,</hi> and <hi>Nova Albion. Cibola</hi> ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth on the Eastside, whose chief City is of the same name, and denominates the whole Province. The chief Town next to <hi>Cibola</hi> is called <hi>Totontaa,</hi> which is temperate and
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:53246:43"/>
pleasant, being situated upon a River so called. The third Town worth mentioning is called <hi>Tinguez,</hi> which was burnt by the <hi>Spaniards;</hi> who under the conduct of <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisco Vasquez de Coronado</hi> made this Province subject to the King of <hi>Spain, Anno Dom.</hi> 1540. And since this Town of <hi>Tinguez</hi> hath been rebuilt and inhabited by the <hi>Spaniards;</hi> There is a goodly Colledge of Jesuites, who only preach to the <hi>Indians</hi> of that country. <hi>Nova Albion</hi> lyeth on the West side towards <hi>Tartary,</hi> and is very little inhabited by the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who have found no wealth or riches there. Our ever Renowned and Noble Captain Sir <hi>Francis Drake</hi> discovered it, entred upon it, and hee named it <hi>Nova Albion,</hi> because the King that then was, did willingly submit himself unto our Queen <hi>Elizabeth.</hi>

               <p>The Country abounds with fruits pleasing both the eye and the Palate.

The bounds between this <hi>Quivira</hi> and <hi>Mexico</hi> Empire is <hi>Mar Virmiglio,</hi> or <hi>Californio.</hi> The third Kingdome belonging to the <hi>Mexican</hi> part and Northern Tract is <hi>Iucatan;</hi> which was first discovered by <hi>Francisco Hernandez de Cordova,</hi> in the year 1517. It is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Iucatan,</hi> not as some have conceited from <hi>Ioctan</hi> the son of <hi>Heber,</hi> who they thinke came out of the East, where the Scripture placeth him, <hi>Gen.</hi> 12. 23. to inhabite here, but from <hi>Iucatan</hi> which in the <hi>Indian</hi> tongue, fignifieth, what say you? for when the <hi>Spaniards</hi> at their first arriving in that Country did aske of the <hi>Indians</hi> the name of the place, the Savages not understanding what they meaned, replyed unto them <hi>Iucatan,</hi> which is, what say you? whereupon the <hi>Spaniards</hi> named it, and ever since have cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led it <hi>Iucatan.</hi> The whole Country is at least 900. miles in circuit, and is a <hi>Penin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

In the yeer 1632. the <hi>Indians</hi> of this Country in many places of it were like to rebell against their <hi>Spanish</hi> Governour, who vexed them sorely, making them bring in to him their Fowles and Turkies (whereof there is also great abundance) and their hony and wax (wherein hee traded) at the rate and price which hee pleased to set them for his better advantage; which was such a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage to them, that to enrich him they impoverished themselves; and so resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to betake themselves to the Woods and Mountaines; where in a rebellious way they continued some Months, untill the Franciscan Fryers, who have there great power over them, reduced them back, and the Governour (lest hee should quite lose that Country by a further rebellion) granted to them not onely a generall pardon in the Kings name, but for the future promised to use them more mildly and gently.</p>
               <p>The second part of it is called <hi>Guatemala,</hi> (wherein I lived for the space of almost twelve yeers) whose Inhabitants have lost formerly halfe a million of their kinsmen and friends by the unmercifull dealing of the <hi>Spaniards;</hi> and yet for all the losse of so many thousands, there is no part of <hi>America</hi> more flourishing then this with great and populous <hi>Indians</hi> Townes. They may thank the Fryers who defend them daily against the <hi>Spaniards</hi> cruelty, and this yet for their owne ends; for while the <hi>Indians</hi> flourish and increase, the Fryers purses flourish also and are filled. This Country is very fresh and plentifull. The chief Cities are <hi>Guatemala, Cassuca,</hi> and <hi>Chiapa;</hi> whereof I shall speak more largely hereafter. The third part of <hi>Iucatan</hi> is <hi>Acasamil,</hi> which is an Island over against <hi>Guatemala,</hi> which is now commonly called by the <hi>Spaniards Sta.

               <p>This Countrey is so pleasing to the eye, and abounding in all things necessary, that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> call it <hi>Mahomets</hi> Paradise. Among other flourishing trees, here grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth one of that nature, that a man cannot touch any of its branches, but it withereth presently. It is as plentifull of Parrets, as our Countrey of <hi>England</hi> is of Crowes; Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kies, Fowles, Quailes and Rabbets are ordinary meat there. There are many populous <hi>Indian</hi> Townes (though not so many as about <hi>Guatemala</hi>) in this Countrey; and espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially two Cities of <hi>Spaniards;</hi> the one <hi>Leon,</hi> a Bishops Seat, and the other <hi>Granada,</hi> which standeth upon a Lake of fresh water, which hath above three hundred miles in compasse, and having no intercourse with the Ocean, doth yet continually ebbe and flow. But of this Countrey, and of this City especially I shall say somewhat more, when I come to speake of my travailing through it.</p>
               <p>Thus I have briefly touched upon the <hi>Mexican</hi> part, and so much of the Northern Tract as is under the King of <hi>Spain</hi> his Dominion, leaving more particulars, untill I come to shew the order of my being in and journeying through some of these Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries. I will now likewise give you a glimpse of the Southern Tract, and <hi>Peruan</hi> part of <hi>America.</hi> Which containeth chiefly five great Countries or Kingdomes, some in whole, and others in part, subject to the Crown of <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Portugal,</hi> which are, first <hi>Castella aurea;</hi> secondly, <hi>Gujana;</hi> thirdly, <hi>Peru;</hi> fourthly, <hi>Brasile;</hi> fifthly, <hi>Chille.</hi> But I will not fill my History with what others have written of the foure last named Countries, wherein I was not much; but what I could learne of <hi>Peru,</hi> I will briefly speak, and so come to the first <hi>Castella aurea,</hi> through which I travailed. <hi>Peru</hi> is held to be yet more rich a Countrey then is <hi>Mexico;</hi> for although it hath not the conveniency of trafique by the North Sea, which <hi>Mexico</hi> hath; but doth send the Commodities in it to <hi>Panama,</hi> and from thence transports them either over the straight <hi>Isthmus,</hi> or by the River <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agre</hi> to <hi>Partabel</hi> upon the North Sea; yet the Countrey is farre richer then <hi>Mexico,</hi> by reason of the more abundance of Mines of silver which are in it. The mountaines na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>Potosi</hi> are thought to be of no other metall, which the King of <hi>Spain</hi> will not have to be opened until they have exhausted those which are already discovered and dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, and have found the <hi>Spaniards</hi> worke enough, and yeelded them treasure enough ever since they first conquered those parts. The soile is very fruitfull of all such fruits as are found in <hi>Spain.</hi> The Olives are bigger then those of <hi>Spain,</hi> the oyle sweeter and cleerer. The Grapes yeeld also a wine farre stronger then any of <hi>Spain,</hi> and there is much made, by reason it cannot conveniently bee brought from <hi>Spain.</hi> There is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise wheat in great store; and all this fruitfull soile lyeth low under high Mountaines which divide betwixt <hi>Indians</hi> not as yet conquered and <hi>Brasile.</hi> But those Mountaines are a great helpe unto those pleasant Valleys with the waters that fall from them; for in all those parts inhabited by <hi>Spaniards</hi> towards the South Sea, it is most certain and most observable that it never raineth, in so much that the houses are uncovered on the tops, and onely matts laid over them to keep off the dust, and yet is this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey what with the waters that fall from the Mountaines, what with the morning and evening dewes, as fruitfull and plentifull as any Countrey in the World. The chief City is called <hi>Lima,</hi> where there is a Viceroy and a Court of Chancery, and an Arch-Bishop. It hath a Port some two miles from it named <hi>Callau;</hi> where lie the ships that convey yearly the treasure of that Kingdome to <hi>Panama.</hi> There lie also other ships, which trafique to the <hi>East-India's,</hi> and to all the Coasts of <hi>Guatemala,</hi> and to <hi>Aca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulco</hi> the Southern Haven of <hi>Mexico.</hi> This Port of <hi>Callau</hi> is not so strong as the great, nay inestimable wealth that is commonly in it and in the City of <hi>Lim<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </hi> should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, for I have heard many <hi>Spaniards</hi> say, that in the yeare 1620. a few ships of <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers</hi> (as some say) or of <hi>English</hi> (as others affirme) appeared before the Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven-waiting for the ships that were to convey the Kings revenews to <hi>Panama,</hi> and hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that they were departed (though by a false report) followed them, and so for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sooke the attempting to take the <hi>Callau;</hi> which certainly had they manly attempted, they had taken it, and in it the greatest treasure that in any one part of the world could have beene found. But the <hi>Spaniards</hi> seldome see thereabout foraine ships, and so live more carelesly in securing or strengthning that Coast. Though <hi>Peru</hi> bee

thus rich in fruits and Mines, yet <hi>Chille</hi> farre exceedeth it in gold; which edgeth the <hi>Spaniards</hi> to a constant and continuall Warre with the Inhabitants, which are a strong, warlike, and most valiant people. They are grown as skilfull in the use of weapons, swords, Pistols and Muskets as the <hi>Spaniaods,</hi> and have taken many <hi>Spaniards,</hi> men and women prisoners; and of the <hi>Spanish</hi> women have had so many children, called <hi>Mestiz<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>es,</hi> that by them (who have proved most valiant) they have much increased both their strength and skill. They hold the <hi>Spaniards</hi> hard to it, and the War is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the most dangerous of any the <hi>Spaniards</hi> have; in so much that the Counsell of <hi>Spain</hi> doth pick out from <hi>Flanders</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> the best souldiers to send them thither. And a Captaine that hath served long, well and faithfully in <hi>Flanders,</hi> by way of credit and promotion is sent to the Warres of <hi>Chille,</hi> to fight for that great treasure of gold, which certainly is there. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> have it in three faire Cities; the <hi>Conception</hi> (which is a Bishops Seat) and <hi>Santiago,</hi> and <hi>Valdivia.</hi> This last is so named from one <hi>Valdivia,</hi> who was Governour of it, and the first cause and author of those Wars.</p>
               <p>This man was so extraordinarily covetous of the gold of that Countrey, that hee would not let the <hi>Indians</hi> possesse or injoy any of it themselves; but did vex them, whip, and beat, yea and kill some of them, because they brought him not enough, and imployed them daily in seeking it out for him, charging them with a tax and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of so much a day: which the <hi>Indians</hi> not being able to performe, nor to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie an unsatiable minde and greedy covetousnesse, resolved to rebell, but so that first they would fill and satiate his heart with gold so that hee should never more covet af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that yellow and glittering metall. Wherefore they joyned and combined them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves together in a warlike posture, and tooke some quantity of gold and melted it, and with it resolutely came upon <hi>Valdivia</hi> the Governour, saying, O <hi>Valdivia</hi> we see thou hast a greedy and unsatiable minde and desire after our gold; wee have not been able to satisfie thee with it hitherto; but now wee have devised away to satiate this thy greedy covetousnesse; here is now enough, drink thy full of it; and with these words they tooke him, and powred the melted gold downe his throat, wherewith he died, never more coveting after that bright and shining drosse, and naming with his name and death that City of <hi>Valdivia,</hi> and with his covetousnesse leaving a rebellion which hath continued to a cruell and bloody War unto this day.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Guiana</hi> and <hi>Brasile</hi> I shall omit to speak of, not having been in any part of them. <hi>Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sile</hi> is little talked of by the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> belonging to the Crowne of <hi>Portugall,</hi> and now part of it to the high and mighty States of the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> who will better sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie by their Histories, and acquaint <hi>Europe</hi> with the riches that are in it.</p>
               <p>I return unto the first part mentioned by me in the Southern and <hi>Peruan</hi> Tract, which was said to bee <hi>Castella aurea,</hi> golden <hi>Castile,</hi> so called for the abundance of gold that is found in it. This containeth the Northern part of <hi>Peruana,</hi> and part of the <hi>Isthmus,</hi> which runneth between the North and South Sea. Besides the gold in it, yet it is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirably stored with silver, Spices, Pearls, and medicinall Herbes. It is divided into foure Provinces. The first is called <hi>Castella deloro;</hi> the second, <hi>Nova Andaluzia;</hi> the third <hi>Nova Granada;</hi> the fourth, <hi>Carthagena. Castella deloro</hi> is situated in the very <hi>Isth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,</hi> and is not very populous by reason of the unhealthfulnesse of the aire, and noi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some savour of the standing pooles. The chief places belonging to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> are first <hi>Theonimay,</hi> or <hi>Nombre de Dios</hi> on the East; the second, which is six leagues from <hi>Nombre de Dios</hi> is <hi>Portabel,</hi> now chiefly inhabited by the <hi>Spaniards</hi> and Mulattoes, and Blackmores, and <hi>Nombre de Dios</hi> almostutterly forsaken by reason of its unhealthful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse. The ships which were wont to anchor in <hi>Nombre de Dios,</hi> and there to take in the Kings treasure, which is yeerly brought from <hi>Peru</hi> to <hi>Panama,</hi> and from thence to the North Sea, now harbour themselves in <hi>Portabel;</hi> which signisyeth <hi>Porto bello,</hi> a faire and goodly Haven, for so indeed it is, and well fortified at the entrance with three Castles, which can reach and command one another. The third and chiefe place be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the <hi>Spaniards</hi> in <hi>Castella del oro</hi> is <hi>Panama,</hi> which is on the Westside and upon the South Sea. This City and <hi>Nombre de Dios</hi> were both built by <hi>Didacus de Niquesa.</hi> And <hi>Nombre de Dios</hi> was so called, because <hi>Niquesa</hi> having been crossed with many mischances and misadventures at Sea, when hee came to this place greatly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyced, and bad his men now goe on shore in <hi>Nombre de Dios,</hi> in the name of God, in the name of God. But as I have before observed, the aire being here very unhealthy, the King of <hi>Spain</hi> in the yeare 1584. commanded the houses of <hi>Nombre de Dios</hi> to be pulled
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:53246:44"/>
downe, and to be rebuilt in a more healthy and convenient place: which was performed by <hi>Peter A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>This Noble and gallant Gentleman arriving with threescore and ten souldiers in his company as resolute as himselfe, a little above this Towne of <hi>Nombre de Dios</hi> drew a land his ship, and covering it with boughes, marched over the land with his Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny guided by <hi>Black-mores,</hi> untill he came to a river. Where he cut downe wood, made him a Pinnace, entred the South-sea, went to the Island of Pearles, where hee lay ten daies waiting for a prize, which happily he got (though not so happily after kept it) for from that Island he set upon two <hi>Spanish</hi> ships, and finding them unable to fight, he speedily made them yeeld, and intercepted in them threescore thousand pound weight of gold, and two hundred thousand pound weight in barres or wedges of silver, and returned safely again to the maine land. And though by reason of a mutiny made by his owne Company he neither returned to his country nor to his hidden ship; yet was it such a strange adventure as is not to be forgotten, in that the like was never by any other attempted, and by the <hi>Spaniards</hi> is to this day with much admiration recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</p>
               <p>Much part of this <hi>Castella aurea</hi> as yet is not subdued by the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and so doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse a great treasure lieth hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

In the year 1637. when I chanced to be in <hi>Panama</hi> returning home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to my Country, there came thither some twenty <hi>Indians</hi> Barbarians by way of peace to treate with the President of the Chancery concerning their yeelding up them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to the government of the King of <hi>Spaine.</hi> But as I was informed afterwards at <hi>Carthagena,</hi> nothing was concluded upon, for that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> dare not trust those <hi>Indians,</hi> whom they have found to have rebelled often against them for their hard usage and carriage towards them. These <hi>Indians</hi> which then I saw were very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, tall and lusty men, and well complexioned; and among them one of as red a haire as any our nation can shew; they had bobs of gold in their eares, and some of them little pieces of gold made like a halfe moone hanging upon their neither lips, which argues store of that treasure to be amongst them. Unto this country is joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning <hi>Nova Andaluzia,</hi> which hath on the North side <hi>Castella del oro,</hi> and on the South <hi>Peru:</hi> The best Cities in it are <hi>Tocoio,</hi> now by the <hi>Spaniards</hi> called <hi>St. Margarets,</hi> and another called <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Fee,</hi> or <hi>St. Faith,</hi> an Archbishops seat, and a Court of Justice and Chancery, governed like <hi>Panama</hi> and <hi>Guatemala,</hi> by a President and six Judges, and a Kings Attorney and two high Justices of Court; who have six thousand duckats a yeer allowed them out of the Kings treasure. The fifth City is <hi>Palma;</hi> and the sixth <hi>Merida.</hi> From <hi>Carthagena</hi> through this countrey of <hi>Granada</hi> lieth the rode way to <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma</hi> in <hi>Peru,</hi> all by land. This Country is very strong by reason of the situation of it much amongst stony rockes, which compasse and environ it, and through which there are very narrow passages. Yet it is full of pleasant valleys which do yeeld much fruit, Corne and <hi>Indian</hi> Maiz. There are also in it some Mines of silver, and many golden sanded rivers. <hi>Carthagena,</hi> which is the last Province of <hi>Castella aurea,</hi> hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so a very fruitfull soil, in the which groweth a tree, which if any one do touch, he will hardly escape a poysoning.</p>
               <p>The chiefe Cities in it are, first <hi>Carthagena,</hi> which Sir <hi>Francis Drake</hi> in the yeer 1585. surprised, and (as the <hi>Spaniards</hi> affirme) burned most part of it, and besides inestima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble sums of money, took with him from thence 230. peeces of Ordnance. I dare say now it hath not so many; yet it is reasonable well fortified; though not so strong as <hi>Porta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel.</hi>

It is a faire and gallant City and very rich, by reason of the pearles which are brought to it from <hi>Margarita,</hi> and the Kings revenues, which from all <hi>Nova Granada</hi> are sent thither. It is a Bishops seat, and hath many rich Churches and Cloisters. It is not governed by a Court of Justice and Chancery as <hi>S<hi rend="sup">ta.</hi> Fee</hi> is, but onely by one Governour. It hath been often moved to the Councell of <hi>Spaine</hi> to have some Galleys made to runne about those Seas, and that <hi>Carthagena</hi> bee the chiefe harbour of them. From this City received <hi>England</hi> the losse of that little Island named <hi>Providence</hi> by us, and by the <hi>Spaniards Sta. Catalina,</hi> which though but little, might have been of a great, nay greater advantage to our Kingdom, than any other of our plantations in <hi>America;</hi> which the <hi>Spaniards</hi> wel understood when they set al their strength of <hi>Carthagena</hi> against it; but I hope the Lord hath his time appointed when we shall advantage our selves by it again. To this City of <hi>Carthagena</hi> cometh every yeer also in small Frigots most of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digo, Cochinil &amp; Sugar, which is made in the country of <hi>Guatemala;</hi> the <hi>Spaniards</hi> think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it safer to ship these their goods in little Frigots upon the lake of <hi>Granada</hi> in <hi>Nicara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gua,</hi> &amp; from thence to send them to <hi>Carthagena</hi> to be shipped with the Galeons that come from <hi>Portabel</hi> with the treasure of <hi>Peru,</hi> than to send them by the ships of <hi>Honduras,</hi> which have often been a prey unto the <hi>Hollanders.</hi> These frigots were thought by the <hi>Spaniards</hi> to come too neer the reach of <hi>Providence,</hi> and therefore it hath been their care and provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to remove us from this reach of their Frigots.

               <p>Thus have I brought thee, Gentle Reader, round about <hi>America,</hi> and shewed thee the Continent of that biggest part of the world; from the which thou mayst observe the power and greatnesse of the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> who hath got under his Scepter and Dominion so many thousand miles, which were they reckoned up, would be found to be more then are about all <hi>Europe.</hi> But not only is <hi>America</hi> great and spatious by land, but also by sea, glorying in more and some greater Islands, then any other part of the world. It would but cause tediousnesse, and seem prolixity to number them all up, which is a worke hard and difficult, for that many as yet are not knowne nor inhabited, and whose goodnesse and greatnesse is not discovered; for the Islands called <hi>Luc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Therefore I will omit to be over tedious and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lixe, and will but briefly speake of the best and chiefe of them, taking them in order from that part of the Continent, <hi>Carthagena,</hi> where even now I left thee. But in the first place calls upon my pen the Jewel Island called <hi>Margarita,</hi> which is situated in the sea nigh unto <hi>Castella aurea,</hi> and not farre distant from two other Islands, named <hi>Cubag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                     </gap>.</hi> True it is this Island of <hi>Margarita</hi> is by some much slighted for want of corne, grasse, trees and water; in so much that it hath been knowne sometime that an inhabitant of that Island hath willingly changed for a Tun of water a Tunne of wine. But the great abundance of pretious stones in it maketh amends for the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer wants and defects; for from them is the name of <hi>Margarita</hi> imposed on that I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sland. But especially it yeeldeth store of pearles, those gemmes which the Latine wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters call <hi>Uniones,</hi> because <hi>nulli duo reperiuntur indiscreti,</hi> they alwaies are found to grow in couples. In this Island there are many rich Merchants, who have thirty, fourty, fifty <hi>Black-more</hi> slaves only to fish out of the sea about the rockes these pearles. These <hi>Black-mores</hi> are much made of by their Masters, who must needs trust them with a trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure hidden in the waters, and in whose will it is to passe by of those they find, none, few, or many. They are let downe in baskets into the Sea, and so long continue under the water, untill by pulling the rope by which they are let downe, they make their sign to be taken up. I have heard some say that have thus dealt in pearles, that the chief meat they feed their <hi>Black-mores</hi> with, is roast-meat, which maketh them their wind &amp; breath longer in the water. From <hi>Margarita</hi> are all the pearles sent to be refined and bored to <hi>Carthagena,</hi> where is a faire and goodly street of no other shops then of these Pearle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dressers. Commonly in the moneth of <hi>Iidy</hi> there is a ship or two at most ready in that Island to carry the Kings revenue, and the Merchants pearles to <hi>Carthagena.</hi> One of these ships are valued commonly at threescore thousand, or fourscore thousand duckats,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:53246:45"/>
and sometimes more; and therefore are reasonable well manned; for that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> much feare our <hi>English</hi> and the <hi>Holland</hi> ships. The yeare that I was in <hi>Carthagena,</hi> which was 1637. a ship of these laden with pearles was chased by one of our ships from the Island of <hi>Providence</hi> (by some it was thought to be our ship called the <hi>Neptune</hi>) which after a little fighting had almost brought the poore <hi>Spaniard</hi> to yeeld his pearies, and had certainly carried away that great treasure (as I was informed in <hi>Carthagena</hi> foure daies after the fight by a <hi>Spaniard</hi> who was in the ship of <hi>Margarita</hi>) had not two other ships of <hi>Holland</hi> come between to challenge from our <hi>English</hi> man that prize, alleadg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their priviledge from the mighty States united for all prizes upon those seas and coast. And whilst our <hi>English</hi> and <hi>Hollander</hi> did thus strive for the Pearles, the <hi>Spanish</hi> ship ran on shore upon a little Island, and speedily unladed and hid in the woods part of the treasures, and perceiving the <hi>Hollander</hi> coming eagerly in pursuit of it, the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard</hi> set on fire the ship, and neither <hi>Spaniard, English,</hi> nor <hi>Hollander,</hi> enjoyed what might have been a great and rich prize to <hi>England.</hi> From <hi>Carthagena</hi> was sent presently a man of Warre to bring home the pearles hid in the wood, which were not the third part of what was in the ship.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Iamaica</hi> is another Island under the power of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> which is in length 280. miles, and 70. in breadth, which though it exceed <hi>Margarita</hi> in sweet and pleasant streames and fountaines of water, yet is far inferiour to it in riches. Some Hides, some Sugar, and some Tobacco are the chiefe commodities from thence. There are only two Townes of note in it, <hi>Oristana</hi> and <hi>Sevilli;</hi> here are built ships which have proved as well at sea, as those that are made in <hi>Spaine.</hi> This Island was once very poulous, but now is almost destitute of <hi>Indians;</hi> for the <hi>Spaniards</hi> have s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

But farre beyond the two former is the Island of <hi>Cuba,</hi> which is three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred miles long, and seventy broad, which was first made knowne to <hi>Europe</hi> by <hi>Colum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus</hi> his second navigation. This Island is full of Forrests, Lakes, and mountaines. The aire is very temperate, the soile very fertill, producing brasse of exact perfection, and some gold though drossie hath formerly been found in it. It aboundeth also with Gin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, Cassia, Masticke, Aloes, some Cinnamon, Cana fistula, Zarzaparilla, and Sugar, and hath of flesh, fish, and fowles great plenty; but especially such store of sea Tortois, and Hogs, that the ships at their returne to <hi>Spaine</hi> make their chiefe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision of them. My selfe chanced to take physicke there, and whereas I thought that day I should have a fowle or rabbet after my physicks working, they brought me a boy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led peece of fresh young Porke, which when I refused to eat, they assured me it was the best dish the Doctors did use to prescribe upon such daies.</p>
               <p>The chiefe Cities of this Island are <hi>Santiago</hi> on the Northerne shore, built by <hi>Iames de Valaseo,</hi> a Bishops seat; and secondly, <hi>Havana,</hi> which is also on the Northerne shore, and is a safe Rode for ships, and the staple of merchandize, and (as the <hi>Spaniards</hi> call it) the key of all the <hi>West-India's,</hi> to lock up or unlock the doore or entrance to all <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica.</hi> Here rideth the King of <hi>Spaines</hi> Navy, and here meet all the Merchant ships from severall ports and Havens of all those Countries afore-named, whether from the Islands or from the Continent: in a word here commonly in the month of <hi>September</hi> is joyned all the treasure as<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I may say of <hi>America,</hi> all the King of <hi>Spains</hi> revenews, with as much more of Merchant goods, which the yeer that I was there were thought to be in all the worth of thirty millions. And the ships which that yeer there did meet to strengthen one another were 53. saile, and set out sooner that yeer then any other upon the 16. of <hi>September,</hi> having that day a faire wind to wafte them homewards through the Gulf of <hi>Bahama. Havana</hi> therefore being the store-house of all <hi>Americaes</hi> treasure, it hath been the <hi>Spaniards</hi> chiefe care to fortifie that; and truely it is so strong, that the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi> hold it impossible to be taken, and doe boast of foure impregnable forts, to wit at <hi>Antwerp, Millan, Pamplona,</hi> and <hi>Havana.</hi> This hath two strong Castles, the one at the point or entrance of the Haven toward the Sea; the other more within, on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther side almost over against it; which two Castles (the passage in the mouth of the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven being so narrow, that one onely ship in breast may enter) will keep and defend the Port from many hundred saile. I was my selfe in the great and chiefe Castle, and truly found it very strong, though by land I judged it might be as easily taken, as other strong Castles here in <hi>Europe</hi> have been overpowerd by a great and powerfull army. It hath in
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:53246:46"/>
it besides many others, twelve peeces of Ordnance of brasse exceeding great, which they call The twelve Apostles. But for all this strength of the <hi>Havana,</hi> it could not once de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend six or seven millions (according to the <hi>Spaniards</hi> owne account) which the one part of the Kings Navy brought from <hi>St. Iohn de Ulhua</hi> to the sight of this impregna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble fort, and protected with such twelve Apostles. It was as I take it the yeer 1629. when that ever renowned <hi>Hollander</hi> (whom like unto our <hi>Drake</hi> the <hi>Spaniards</hi> to this day fear and tremble at, calling him <hi>Pie de Palo,</hi> that is, wooden leg) waited at the Cape of <hi>St. Anthrny</hi> for the <hi>Spanish</hi> fleet of <hi>Nova Hispania;</hi> which according to his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation coming, he manly set upon it, saluting and welcoming the great treasure in it with a full side of roaring Ordnance; the sound was more dolefull then joyfull and welcome to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who thought it safer sleeping in a whole skinne, then to be unquieted by fighting, and with the sight of torne and mangled bodies, by <hi>Mars</hi> his furious and fiery balls, and so called a Councell of warre to resolve what they should doe to save the Kings great treasure which was intrusted to them in those ships. The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult of the Councell was to flie and with some discharging of their Ordinance to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend themselves, untill they could put into a river in the Island of <hi>Cuba,</hi> not far from <hi>Havana</hi> called <hi>Matanzos.</hi> There were in that fleet of <hi>Spaine</hi> many gallants and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, and two Judges of the Chancery of <hi>Mexico,</hi> which were that yeer sent. to <hi>Madrid</hi> as guilty in the mutiny before mentioned, there was in it of my acquaintance a Dominican Frier, named Frier <hi>Iacintho de Hozes,</hi> who had been sent to those parts to visit all the Dominican Cloisters of <hi>New-Spaine,</hi> and had got of bribes at least eight thousand duckats (as I was informed the yeer after by a Frier his compainon, whom he sent from <hi>Havana</hi> to <hi>Guatemala</hi> to make knowne to his friends his losse of all that hee had got, and to beg a new contribution to helpe him home) there was also in that fleet <hi>Don Martin de Carillo;</hi> who was the Inquisitor and Commissioner to judge the Delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents in the fore-mentioned mutiny of <hi>Mexico,</hi> who was thought to have got twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty thousand duckats cleer; besides these a Bishop, and many rich Merchants, all under the command of <hi>Don Iuan de Guzman y Torres</hi> Admirall to all the fleet. They all fled for their lives and goods; but the gallant <hi>Hollanders</hi> chased them. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> thinking the <hi>Hollanders</hi> would not venture up the river after them, put into <hi>Matanzos;</hi> but soone after they had entred, they found the river too shallow for their heavy and great bellied Galeons, and so run them up on ground; which done, the better and richer sort escaped to land, endeavouring to escape with what wealth they could; some got out Cabinets, some bags; which the <hi>Hollanders</hi> perceiving came upon them with bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let messengers, which soone overtooke and stopt their flying treasures. Some few Cabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets were hid, all the rest became that day the gallant <hi>Pie de Palo</hi> or the wooden legd Captaines prize for the mighty States of <hi>Holland.</hi> The Frier <hi>Hozes</hi> was got into a boat with his Cabinet under his habit, which had in it nothing but chaines of gold, dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds, Pearles and pretious stones; and halfe a dozen <hi>Hollanders</hi> leapt into the boat af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him, and snatched it from him, as his owne friend and companion related after to us in <hi>Guatemala. Don Iuan de Guzman y Torres</hi> the Admirall when he came to <hi>Spaine</hi> was imprisoned, lost his wits for a while, and after was beheaded. Thus in the sight of impregnable <hi>Havana</hi> and of those 12 brazen Apostles, was <hi>Holland</hi> glorious and made rich with a seven million prize.</p>
               <p>But before I end this Chapter, I may not forget the chiefest of all the Islands of this new world, which is called <hi>Hispaniola,</hi> &amp; formerly by the natives <hi>Hatie,</hi> which lamenteth the losse of at least three millions of <hi>Indians</hi> murthered by her new Masters of <hi>Spaine.</hi> This Island is the biggest that as yet is discovered in al the world; it is in compasse about 1500. miles, and enjoyneth a temperate aire, a fertill soile, rich mines; and trades much in Ambar, Sugar, Ginger, Hides, and Wax. It is reported for certaine that here in twenty daies herbes will ripen and roots also and be fit to be eaten, which is a strong argument of the exact temperature of the aire. It yeeldeth in nothing to <hi>Cuba,</hi> but excelleth it in three things especially; first in the finenesse of the gold, which is here more pure and unmixed; secondly, in the increase of the Sugar, one Sugar Cane here silling twenty and sometimes thirty measures; and thirdly, in the goodnesse of the soile for tillage, the corne here yeelding an hundred fold. This fertility is thought to be caused by four great rivers, which water and enrich all the four quarters of the Island; all four doe spring from one only mountaine, which standeth in the very midst and center of the Country, <hi>Iuna</hi> running to the East, <hi>Artihinnacus</hi> to the West, <hi>Iacchus</hi> to the North, and <hi>Naihus</hi> to the South.</p>

From the moneth of <hi>October</hi> untill <hi>February</hi> I did abide with my friends, and companions the Fryers under the command of Fryer <hi>Calvo</hi> in that house of recreation called St. <hi>Iacintho,</hi> and from thence injoyed the sight of all the Townes and of what else was worth the seeing about <hi>Mexico.</hi> But the time I was there, I was carefull to informe my self of the state of <hi>Philippinas,</hi> whither my first purposes had drawne me from <hi>Spain.</hi> It was my fortune to light upon a Fryer and an acquaintance of some of my friends, who was that yeer newly come from <hi>Manila</hi> whither I was going; who wished mee and some other of my friends as wee tendred our soules good never to goe to those parts, which were but snares and trap-dores to let downe to hell, where occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions and temptations to sinne were daily, many in number, mighty in strength, and to get out of them, <hi>labor &amp; opus,</hi> hard and difficult. And that himself, had not he by stealth gotten away (and that to save his soul) certainly he had never come from thence; who had often upon his knees begged leave of his superiours to returne to <hi>Spain,</hi> and could not obtaine it. Many particulars wee could not get from him, nor the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of his coming away; Onely hee would often say that the Fryers that live there are devils in private and in those retired places where they live among the <hi>Indians</hi> to instruct and teach them; and yet in publick before their superiours and the rest of Fry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers they must appeare Saints, they must put on the cloak of hypocrisie to cover their inward devilishnesse, they must bee cloathed with sheeps skins though within they bee <hi>lupi rapaces,</hi> ravenous Wolves, ravening after their neighbours Wives, and ravening af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their neighbours wealth; and yet with all this unpreparednesse, with this out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, seeming and frothy sanctity, and inward hellishnesse and deep rooted world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse and covetousnesse, when the Superiours command and please to send them, they must goe in a disguised manner to <hi>Iapan</hi> or <hi>China</hi> to convert to Christianity those peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple though with perill and danger of their lives. Many such like discourses wee got out of this Fryer; and that if wee went to live there, we must bee subject to the penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of many Excommunications for triviall toyes and trifles, which the Superiours doe lay upon the Consciences of their poore Subjects, who may as soone strive against the common course of nature not to see with their eyes, nor hear with their eares, nor speake with their tongues, as to observe all those things which against sense, reason and nature with grievous censures and Excommunications are charged and fastened up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them. Hee told us further of some Fryers that had despaired under those rigorous courses, and hanged themselves, not being able to beare the burden of an afflicted and tormented Conscience; and of others that had been hanged, some for murthering of their rigid and cruell Superiours; and some that had beene found in the morning hanging with their queanes at the Cloister gates, having beene found together in the night, and so murthered and hanged up either by the true Husband, or by some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther who bare affection to the woman. These things seemed to us very strange, and wee perceived that all was not gold that glistred, nor true zeal of soules that carried so many from <hi>Spain</hi> to those parts; or if in some there were at first a better and truer zeale then in others, when they came to <hi>Philippinas,</hi> and among those strong tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taions, wee found that their zeale was soone quenched.

But they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing natives and borne in that Countrey discovered presently unto us that inveterate spight and hatred which they bare to such as came from <hi>Spain;</hi> they told us plainly that they and true <hi>Spaniards</hi> born did never agree, and that they knew their Superiors would bee unwilling to admit of us; yet furthermore they informed us that they thought we might be entertained in the Province of <hi>Guaxaca,</hi> where hal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap> the Fryers were of <hi>Spain</hi> and half Criolians and Natives; but in case wee should not speed there, they would warrant us we should be welcome to the Province of <hi>Guatemala,</hi> where almost all the Fryers were of <hi>Spain,</hi> and did keep under such as were Natives born in that Country. It did a little trouble us to consider that <hi>Guatemala</hi> was three hundred leagues off, and that we were ignorant of the <hi>Mexican</hi> tongue, and unprovided of mony and horses for so long a journey. But yet we considered <hi>Philippinas</hi> to be further, and no hopes there of returning ever again to Christendome; wherefore we resolved to rely upon Gods provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence onely, and to venture upon a three hundred leagues journey with what smal means we had, and to sell what Books and small trifles we had to make as much money as might buy each of us a horse. But while we were thus preparing our selves secretly for <hi>Guate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mala</hi> wee were affrighted and disheartned with what in the like case to ours happened. A Fryer of our company named Fryer <hi>Peter Borrallo,</hi> without acquainting us or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of his friends with what he intended, made a secret escape from us, and (as after we were informed) took his way alone to <hi>Guatemala.</hi> This so incensed our Superior <hi>Calvo,</hi> that after great search and enquiry after him, he betook himself to the Viceroy begging his assistance and Proclamation, in the publick Market place, for the better finding out his lost sheep, and alleadging that none ought to hide or privily to harbour any Fryer that had been sent from <hi>Spain</hi> to <hi>Philippinas</hi> to preach there the Gospell, for that the foresaid Fryers were sent by the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> whose bread they had eate, and at whose charges they had been brought from <hi>Spain</hi> to <hi>Mexico,</hi> and at the same Kings charges ought to bee carried from <hi>Mexico</hi> to <hi>Philippinas;</hi> and therefore if any Fryer now in the half way should recant of his purpose of going to <hi>Philippinas,</hi> and should by flight escape from his Superiour and the rest of his company, the same ought to be punished as guilty of defrauding the Kings charges. This reason of <hi>Calv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>
                  </hi> being a politicke and state reason prevailed so farre with the Viceroy, that immediately hee commanded a Proclamation to bee made against whosoever should know of the said <hi>Peter Borrallo</hi> and should not produce him to his Highnesse, or should harbour him or any other Fryer belonging to <hi>Philippinas</hi> from that time forward untill the ships were departed from <hi>Acapulco;</hi> and that whosoever should trespasse against this Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, should suffer imprisonment at his Highnesse his will and and pleasure, and the penalty of five hundred Duckats to bee paid in at the Kings Exchequer. With this Proclamation <hi>Calvo</hi> began to insult over us, and to tell us, wee were the Kings slaves under his conduct, and that if any of us durst to leave him (for hee wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap> jealous of most of us) hee doubted not but with the Viceroy his assistance and Proclamation he should find both us and <hi>Peter Borrallo</hi> out to our further shame and confusion. This did very much trouble us, and made my <hi>Irish</hi> friend <hi>Thomas de Leon</hi> his heart to faint, and his courage to relent, and utterly to renounce before mee his former purposes of stay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and hiding himselfe; yet hee protested to mee, if I was still of the same minde, hee would not discover mee; but seeing his weaknesse, I durst not trust him, but made as if I were of his minde. Thus I betooke my self to the other three of my friends (of whom one was <hi>Antonio Melendez</hi> that had beene the first cause of my comming from <hi>Spain</hi>) whom I found much troubled, doubtfull and wavering what course to take.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="84" facs="tcp:53246:48"/>They considered if wee should flie, what a shame it would be to us to be taken and brought back to <hi>Mexico</hi> as prisoners, and forcedly against our wills to be shipped to <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lippinas;</hi> they considered further if they went, what a slavish and uncomfortable life they should live in <hi>Philippinas,</hi> without any hopes of ever returning again to Christendom; yet further they looked upon the Viceroy his Proclamation, and thought it hard to breake through the opposition and authority of so great a man; and lastly in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation they beheld the estimation that <hi>Calvo</hi> had of them, as of slaves and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

But after all these serious thoughts our only comfort was that <hi>Peter Borallo</hi> was safely escaped, and (as we were informed) had been met farre from <hi>Mexico</hi> travailing alone towards <hi>Guatemala.</hi> And we thought, why might not we escape as well as he. Then I told them that my resolution was to stay, though alone I returned either to <hi>Spaine,</hi> or tooke my journey to <hi>Guatemala;</hi> the rest were glad to see mee resolute, and gave their hands that they would venture as much as <hi>I</hi> should. Then we set upon the time when we should take our flight, and agreed that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one should have a Horse in readinesse in <hi>Mexico,</hi> and that the night before the rest of our company should depart from <hi>Mexico</hi> towards <hi>Acapulco</hi> to take shipping, we should by two and two in the evening leave <hi>St. Iacint<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>o,</hi> and meet in <hi>Mexico</hi> where our Horses stood, and from thence set out and travaile all the night, continuing our journey so the first two or three nights and resting in the day time, untill we were some twenty or thirty leagues from <hi>Mexico.</hi> For we thought the next morning <hi>Calvo</hi> awaking and missing us would not stop the journey of the rest of his company for our sakes, to search and inquire after us; or if he did, it would be but for one day or two at the most, till he had inquired for us in <hi>Mexico,</hi> or a dayes journey in some of the common or beaten rodes of <hi>Mexico,</hi> where we would be sure he should not heare of us; for we also agreed to travail out of any common or knowne rode for the first two or three nights. This resolution was by us as well performed and carried on, as it had been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed upon, though some had been fearfull that a counsell betwixt foure could never be kept secret, nor such a long journey as of nine hundred miles be compassed with such small means of money as was among us, for the maintenance of our selves and Horses; for after our Horses were bought, we made a common purse, and appointed one to be the purse-bearer, &amp; found that amongst us all there were but twenty duckats, which in that rich and plentifull country was not much more then here twenty <hi>English</hi> shillings, which seemed to us but as a morning dew, which would soone be spent in provender only for our Horses; yet we resolved to goe on, relying more upon the providence of God, then upon any earthly meanes; and indeed this proved to us a far better support then all the drosse of gold and silver could have done; and we reckoned that after we had travailed fourty leagues from <hi>Mexico,</hi> and entred without feare into the rode, we had for our twenty duckats neer fourty now in our common purse. The reason was, for that most commonly we went either to Friers Cloisters who knew us not, or to rich farmes of <hi>Spaniards</hi> who thought nothing too good for us, and would not onely en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaine us stately, but at our departure would give us money for one or two daies jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney. All our feare was to get safely out of <hi>Mexico,</hi> for wee had been informed that <hi>Calvo</hi> had obtained from the Viceroy officers to watch in the chiefest rodes both day and night untill he had departed with his Traine of Friers to <hi>Acapulco.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And for all the Viceroy his Proclamation we got a true and trustie friend, who offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to guide us out of <hi>Mexico</hi> by such a way as we needed not to feare any would watch for us. So with our friend and a map about us to guide us after he had left us in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, we cheerfully set out of <hi>Mexico</hi> about ten of the clock at night, about the middle of <hi>February,</hi> and meeting no body about <hi>Guadalupe</hi> which was the way wee went out (though the contrary way to <hi>Guatemala,</hi> which on purpose we followed for feare the true way should be beset) we comfortably travailed all that night, till in the morning we came to a little Town of <hi>Indians,</hi> where we began to spend of our small stock, calling up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Indians</hi> for a Turkey and Capon to break our fast with our friend and guide be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he returned to <hi>Mexico.</hi> Breakefast being ended we took our leaves of him, and went to rest, that we might be more able to performe the next nights journey, which was to Crosse the Countrey towards <hi>Atlisco,</hi> which is in a valley of twenty miles about at least, and doth give it the name of the valley of <hi>Atlixco</hi> and is a valley much mentioned in all those parts, for the exceeding great plenty of wheat that is there reaped every yeer, and is the chief sustenance and reliefe of <hi>Mexico</hi> and all the Townes about. In this
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:53246:48"/>
Valley are many rich Townes of <hi>Spaniards</hi> and <hi>Indians;</hi> but we shunned to enter into them, and went from farme to farme out of the high-waies, where we found good entertainment of those rich Farmers and Yeomen, who bare such respect unto the Preists, that truely they thought themselves happy with our company. Here we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to shake off all fear, and would no more like Bats and Owles fly in the night, but that we might with more pleasure enjoy the prospect of that valley, and of the rest of the Countrey we travailed by day; yet still crossing the Countrey, we went from thence to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards another valley called the valley of <hi>St. Pablo,</hi> or <hi>Pauls</hi> valley, which though it be not as big as the valley of <hi>Atlisco,</hi> yet is held to be a richer valley; for here they enjoy a double harvest of wheat every yeer. The first seed they sow is watered, and growes with the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon season raine; and the second seed which they sow in summer as soone as their first harvest is in, when the season of raine is past, they water with many Springs which fall into that Valley from the mountaines which round beset it, and let in the water among their wheat at their pleasure, and take it away when they see fit. Here live Yeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men upon nothing but their farms, who are judged to be worth some twenty thousand, some thirty thousand, some fourty thousand duckats. In this valley we chanced to light upon one farme where the Yeoman was country-man to my friend <hi>Antonio Melen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dez,</hi> borne in <hi>Segovia</hi> in <hi>Spaine,</hi> who for his sake kept us three daies and nights with him. His table was as well furnished as the table of a Knight might be, his side board full of silver boules and cups, and plates instead of trenchers; lie spared no dainties which might welcome us to his table, no perfumes which might us delight in our chambers, no musick (which his daughters were brought up to) which might with more pleasure help to passe away the time. To him <hi>Antonio Melendez</hi> made known our journey towards <hi>Gu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atemala;</hi> and from him we received directions which way to steere our course untill we might be throughly free from feare and danger; here we began to see the great provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God, who had brought us being strangers to such a friends house, who not onely welcomed us to him, but when we departed gave us a guide for a whole day, and bestowed upon us twenty duckats to helpe to bear our charges. From this valley wee wheeled about to <hi>Tasco,</hi> a Towne of some five hundred Inhabitants which enjoyeth great commerce with the Country about by reason of the great store of Cotton-wool which is there. And here we were very well entertained by a Franciscan Frier, who being of <hi>Spaine</hi> made the more of us, knowing we came from thence. Here we got in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Rode of <hi>Guaxaca,</hi> and went to <hi>Chautla,</hi> which also aboundeth with Cotton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wool, but in it we found no entertainment but what our owne purses would afford us. Next to this place is a great Town called <hi>Zumpango,</hi> which doth consist of at least eight hundred Inhabitants, many of them very rich both <hi>Indians</hi> and <hi>Spaniards.</hi> Their commodities are chiefly Cotton-wooll, and Sugar, and Cochinil. But beyond this Town are the mountaines called <hi>la Misteca,</hi> which abound with many rich and great Townes, and doe trade with the best silke that is in all that Country. Here is also great store of Wax and Hony; and <hi>Indians</hi> live there who traffique to <hi>Mexico</hi> and about the Country with twenty or thirty mules of their owne, chopping and changing, buying and selling commodities, and some of them are thought to be worth ten, or twelve, or fifteen thousand duckats, which is much for an <hi>Indian</hi> to get among the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who thinke all the riches of <hi>America</hi> little enough for themselves. From these mountaines of <hi>Misteca</hi> to <hi>Guaxaca</hi> we saw little observable, only Townes of two or three hundred inhabitants; rich Churches, well built, and better furnished within with lampes, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dlesticks, crownes of silver for the severall statues of Saints; and all the way wee did observe a very fruitfull soil for both <hi>Indian</hi> and <hi>Spanish</hi> wheat, much Sugar, much Cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton-wool, Hony, and here and there some Cochinil, and of Plantins, and other sweet and luscious fruit great store; but above all great abundance of cattel, whose Hides are one of the greatest commodities that from those parts are sent to <hi>Spaine.</hi> Some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported that about <hi>Misteca</hi> formerly much gold had been found, and the <hi>Indians</hi> were wont to use it much, though now they will not be knowne of any, left the greedinesse of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> bring them to misery and destruction, as it hath their neighbours a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout them.

               <p>There are many Mines of Iron which the <hi>Spaniards</hi> will not busie themselves in dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, because they have it cheaper from <hi>Spain;</hi> from hence wee came to the City of <hi>Guaxaca,</hi> whis is a Bishops Seat, though not very bigge, yet a faire and beautifull City

to behold. It standeth fourescore leagues from <hi>Mexico</hi> in a pleasant valley from whence <hi>Cortez</hi> was named <hi>Marques del Valle,</hi> the Marquesse of the Valley. This City, as all the rest of <hi>America,</hi> (except the Sea Towns lyeth open without walls, Bulwarkes, Fors, Towers, or any Castle, Ordnance or Ammunition to defend it. It may consist of at the most two thousand Inhabitants, and are governed by a <hi>Spanish</hi> High Justice called <hi>Alcalde Major,</hi> whose power reacheth over all the Valley, and beyond it as farre as <hi>Nixapa,</hi> and almost to <hi>Tecoantepeque,</hi> a Sea Towne upon <hi>Mar del Zur.</hi> The Valley is of at least fifteen miles in length, and ten in breadth, where runneth in the midst a goodly Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver yeelding great store of fish. The Valley is full of Sheep and other Cattell, which yeeld much Wooll to the Clothiers of the City of <hi>Angels,</hi> store of Hides to the Merchants of <hi>Spain,</hi> and great provision of flesh to the City of <hi>Guaxaca,</hi> and to all the Townes about, which are exceeding rich, and doe maintaine many Cloisters of Fryers, and Churches with stately furniture belonging unto them. But what doth make the Valley of <hi>Guaxaca</hi> to bee mentioned farre and neer, are the good horses which are bred in it, and esteemed to bee the best of all the Country. In this Valley also are some farmes of Sugar, and great store of fruits, which two sorts meeting together have cried up the City of <hi>Guaxaca</hi> for the best Conserves and Preserves that are made in <hi>America.</hi> In the City there are some six Cloisters of Nuns and Fryers, all of them exceeding rich; but above all is the Cloister of the Dominican Fryers, whose Church treasure is worth two or three Millions; and the building of it the fairest and strongest in all those parts, the walls are of stone so broad, that a part of them being upon finishing when I was there I saw Carts goe upon them, with stone and other materials. Here are also two Cloisters of Nuns, which are talked of far and neer not for their religious practices, but for their skill in making two drinkes which are used in those parts, the one called <hi>Chocolatte</hi> (whereof I shall speake heereafter) and the other <hi>Atolle,</hi> which is like unto our <hi>Almond</hi> Milk, but much thicker, and is made of the juyce of the yong <hi>Maiz</hi> or <hi>Indian</hi> wheat, which they so confection with spices, musk, and sugar, that it is not onely admirable in the sweetnesse of the smell, but much more nourishing and comforting the stomack. This is not a Commoditie that can bee transported from thence, but is to be drunk there where it is made. But the other, <hi>Chocolatte,</hi> is made up in Boxes, and sent not onely to <hi>Mexico</hi> and the parts thereabouts, but much of it is yeerly transported into <hi>Spain.</hi> This City of <hi>Guaxaca</hi> is the richer by reason of the safety they enjoy for the carriage of their Commodities to and from the port of St. <hi>Iohn de Ulhua</hi> by the great River <hi>Alvarado</hi> which runneth not far from it; and although the Barkes come not to the City of <hi>Guaxaca,</hi> yet they come up to the <hi>Zapotecas,</hi> and to St. <hi>Ildefonso,</hi> which is not farre from <hi>Guaxaca.</hi> And the carelessenesse of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> here is to bewondred at, that all along this River which runneth up into the heart of their Country, they have built as yet no Castles, Towers, or watch-houses, or planted any Ordinance, trusting onely in this, that great ships cannot come up, as if Frigots or smaller Barks, such as they themselves use, may not bee made to annoy them. But of <hi>Guaxaca</hi> I shall say no more, but conclude that it is of so temperate an aire, so a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounding in fruits, and all provision requisite for mans life, so commodiously situa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted between the North and South Sea, having on the North side St. <hi>Iohn de Ulbua,</hi> and on the South <hi>Tecoantepeque</hi> a small and unfortified harbour, that no place I so much desired to live in whilest I was in those patrs as in <hi>Guaxaca,</hi> which certainly I had attempted as I travailed by it, had I not understood that the Criolian or Native Fryers were many and as deadly enemies unto those that came from <hi>Spain</hi> as were the <hi>Mexicans.</hi> And this their spight and malice they shewed whilest wee were there, to an ancient and grave old Fryer Master in Divinity, who living had been for learning the Oracle of those parts. This old man died when I was there, and because when hee lived they could pick no hole in his Coat, being dead they searched his chamber, and finding in a Coffer some moneys which hee had not made knowne to his Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour when living (which they would reduce to a sinne against his posessed pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, called Propriety, and subject to the censure of Excommunication) they reported that hee had died excommunicated, and might not injoy their Christian buriall in the Church or Cloister, and so ignominiously buried their old Divine, and with him his Crredit and reputation in a grave made in one of their Gardens. A thing much talked on as scandalous to all the City and Country, which they salved with saying hee was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated; but the truth was, he was of <hi>Spaine,</hi> and therefore at his death they
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:53246:49"/>
would shew their spight unto him. For certainly they could not doe it for the sinne of Propriety which by him had been committed in his life; and to them all may be well said what our Saviour said to the Jewes bringing to him a woman found in adultery to bee stoned, Whosoever of you is without sinne, let him cast the first stone; for all of them, yea even the best Fryers that live in <hi>America,</hi> are some way or other, much or lesse guilty of the sinne of Propriety which they professe and vow against. With this which wee saw with our eyes, besides what with our eares wee had heard of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords and factions amongst them, wee thought <hi>Guaxaca</hi> was no place for us to live in; so after three daies we made haste out of it, and departed towards <hi>Chiapa,</hi> which lyeth three hundred miles from thence. And for our comfort in our further travailing we were informed in <hi>Guaxaca,</hi> that in most Towns of the Rode through that country, the <hi>Indians</hi> had an order from the High Justice to give unto Fryers travailing that way either horse to ride on, or to carry their carriages and provision of food freely without mony, if they had none, so that at their departure they should write it down in the town booke what they had spent, not abiding above foure and twenty houres in the Town; which expences of travailers the <hi>Indians</hi> afterwards at the yeers end of their ordinary Justice and Officers were to give an account of with carrying their Towne book un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>Spanish</hi> Justice to whom they belonged, and by so doing these expences were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed of to bee discharged by the common Towne Purse or Treasure, for the which a common plot of ground was alloted to bee yeerly sowen with wheat or <hi>Maiz.</hi> With this charitable relief and help of the Townes wee conceived better of the rest of our long journey, and hoped to compasse it with more ease. And so joyfully we went on, and the first place where wee made triall of this order was at a great Town called <hi>Antequera,</hi> where wee freely called for our fowles and what other provision we saw in the Town, fed heartily on them, and the next day when we were to pay and to depart, wee called for the Town book, subscribed our hands to what wee had spent our selves and horses, and went our way, praising the discretion of the Justices of that Country, who had setled a course so easy and comfortable for us, especially who had but shallow purses for our long journy. Yet we found in some small Towns that the <hi>Indians</hi> were unwilling, and (as they alleadged) unable to extend this Charity to us, being foure in company, and bringing with us the charge likewise of foure horses, which made us sometimes make the longer journey that wee might reach unto some great and rich Towne. The next to <hi>Antiquera</hi> in that Rode is <hi>Nixapa,</hi> which is of at the least eight hundred Inhabitans, <hi>Spaniards</hi> and <hi>Indians,</hi> standing upon the side of a River, which wee were informed was an arme of the great River <hi>Alvarado.</hi> In this Town is a very rich Cloister of Dominican Fryers, where we were well entertained; &amp; in it there is a picture of our Lady, which superstitiously they fancy to have wrought miracles, and is made a pilgrimage from far and neere, and consequently hath great riches and Lampes belonging unto it. This is counted absolutely one of the wealthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est places of all the Countrey of <hi>Guaxaca;</hi> for here is made much Indigo, Sugar, <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chinill;</hi> and here grow many trees of <hi>Cacao,</hi> and <hi>Achiotte,</hi> whereof is made the <hi>Chocolat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te,</hi> and is a commodity of much trading in those parts, though our <hi>English</hi> and <hi>Hollan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> make little of it when they take a prize of it at Sea, as not knowing the secret virtue and quallity of it for the good of the stomack. From hence we went to <hi>Aguatulco</hi> and <hi>Capalita,</hi> also great Towns standing upon a plain Country full of Sheep and Cattell, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounding with excellent fruits, especially <hi>Pines</hi> and <hi>Sandia's,</hi> which are as big as Pumpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and so waterish that they even melt like snow in the mouth, &amp; cool the heat which there is great, by reason it is a low and Marsh kind of ground, lying neer the South Sea. The next chief Town and most considerable after <hi>Capalita</hi> is <hi>Tecoantequepete;</hi> this is a Sea Town upon <hi>Mar del Zur,</hi> and a harbour for small vessels, such as Trade from those parts to <hi>Acapulco</hi> and <hi>Mexico,</hi> and to <hi>Realejo</hi> and <hi>Guatemala,</hi> and sometimes to <hi>Panama.</hi> Here upon some occasions Ships which come from <hi>Peru</hi>' to <hi>Acapulco</hi> doe call in. It is a port no farthet safe, then that no <hi>English</hi> or <hi>Holland</hi> Ships doe come thereabouts, which if they did, they would there find no resistance, but from thence would finde an open and easie Rode over all the Countrey. Upon all this South Sea side from <hi>Acapulco</hi> to <hi>Pana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma,</hi> which is above two thousand miles by land there is no open harbour, but this for <hi>Guaxaca,</hi> and <hi>La Trinidad</hi> for <hi>Guatemala,</hi> and <hi>Realejo</hi> for <hi>Nicaragua,</hi> and <hi>Gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fo de Salinas</hi> for small vessels in <hi>Costa Rica,</hi> and all these unprovided of Ordnance and Ammunition, all open dores to let in any Nation that would take the pains to surround

the World to get a treasure. This port of <hi>Tecoantepeque</hi> is the chiefe for fishing in all that Countrey; wee met him in the wayes sometimes with fifty, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times with a hundred mules together laden with nothing but salt fish for <hi>Guaxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca,</hi> City of the <hi>Angels</hi> and <hi>Mexico.</hi> There are some very rich Merchants dwell in it, who trade with <hi>Mexico, Peru</hi> and <hi>Philippinas,</hi> sending their small vessels out from Port to Port, which come home richly laden with the Commodities of all the Southerne or Easterne parts. From hence to <hi>Guatemala</hi> there is a plaine Rode along the Coast of the South Sea, passing through the Provinces of <hi>Soconuzco</hi> and <hi>Suchutepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques;</hi> but wee aiming at <hi>Chiapa</hi> tooke our journey over the high Rocks and Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines called <hi>Quelenes,</hi> travailing first from <hi>Tecoantepeque</hi> to <hi>Estepeque,</hi> and from thence through a desert of two dayes journey, where wee were faine to lodge one night by a spring of water upon the bare ground in open wide fields, where neither Town nor house is to bee seene, yet thatcht lodges are purposely made for travailers. This plain lyeth so open to the Sea, that the wind from thence blow so strongly and violently that tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailers are scarce able to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>it their horses and mules; which is the reason no people in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habit there, because the windes teare their houses, and the least fire that there breaks out, doth a great deale of mischief. This plaine yet is full of Cattell, and Horses and Mares, some wild, some tame; and through this windy Champaigne Country with much adoe we travailed; though my self thought I should even there end my daies, for the second day being to reach to a Towne, and my three friends riding before, thinking that I followed them, evening now drawing on they made more hast to find the Town. But in the meane while my horse refused to goe any further, threatning to lie downe if I put him to more then hee was able. I knew the towne could not be far, and so I lighted, thinking to walke and lead my horse, who also refused to bee led, and so lay downe. With this a troop of thoughts beset mee, and to none I could give a flat answer. I thought if I should goe on foot to finde out the Towne and my company and leave my horse there sadled, I might both lose my selfe, and my horse and saddle; and if I should find the Towne and come in the morning for my horse, the plain was so wide and spatious, that I might seeke long enough, and neither finde him, nor know the place where I left him, for there was nothing neere to marke the place, nor where to hide the saddle, neither hedge, tree, shrub, within a mile on any side. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I considered my best course would bee to take up my lodging in the wide and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen wildernesse with my horse, and to watch him lest hee should wander and stray a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, untill the morning or untill my friends might send from the towne to see what was become of mee; which they did not that night, thinking I had taken my way to another Town not far from thence, whither they sent in the morning to enquire for me. I looked about therefore for a commodious place to rest in, but found no choice of lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, every where I found a bed ready for mee, which was the bare ground; a bolster onely or pillow I wanted for my head, and seeing no bank did kindly offer it selfe to ease a lost stranger, and pilgrime, I unsadled my weary Jade, and with my saddle fitted my head in stead of a pillow. Thus without a supper I went to bed in my Mothers owne bosome, not a little comforted to see my tired horse pluck up his spirits, and make much of his supper, which there was ready for him, of short, dry and withered grasse, upon which hee sed with a greedy and hungry stomack, promising mee by his feeding that the next day he would performe a journey of at least thirty or forty miles. The poor beast fed apace, my careful eye watched him for at least an houre, when upon a suddain I heard such an hideous noise of howling, barking, and crying, as if a whole Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of dogs were come into the wildernesse, and howled for want of a prey of some dead horse or mule. At first the noise seemed to be a pretty way off from mee; but the more I hearkened unto it, the nigher it came unto mee, and I perceived it was not of dogs by some intermixt shriekings as of Christians, which I observed in it. An obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation too sad for alone man without any helpe or comfort in a wildernesse, which made my haire to stand upright, my heart to pant, my body to bee covered with a fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full sweat as of death. I expected nothing else, not knowing from whence the noise proceeded; sometimes I thought of Witches, sometimes of devils, sometimes of <hi>Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> turned into the shape of beasts, (which amongst some hath beene used) sometimes of wild and savage beasts, and from all these thoughts I promised my self nothing but sure death, for the which I prepared my selfe recommending my soule to the Lord, whilst I expected my body should bee a prey to cruell and mercilessesse beasts; or
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:53246:50"/>
some instruments of that roaring Lion who in the Apostle goeth about seeking whom he may devoure. I thought I could not any waies prevaile by flying or running away, but rather might that way runne my selfe into the jawes of death; to hide there was no place, to lie still I thought was safest, for if they were wild beasts, they might fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low their course another way from mee, and so I might escape. Which truly proved my safest course, for while I lay sweating and panting, judging every cry, every how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and shrieking an alarm to my death, being in this agony and fearfull conflict till about midnight, on a suddain the noise ceased, sleep (though but the shadow of death) seized upon my wearied body, and forsook me not, til the mornings glorious lamp shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning before my slumbering eies and driving away deaths shadow greeted me with life &amp; safety. When I awaked, my soul did magnifie the Lord for my deliverance from that nights danger, I looked about &amp; saw my horse also neer the place where I had left him, I sadled him presently with desire to leave that wildernesse and to find out my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, and to impart unto them what that night had happened unto mee; I had not rid above a mile, when I came to a brook of water, where were two waies, the one straight forward along the desart, where I could discover no Towne, nor houses, nor trees in a prospect of five or six miles at least; the other way was on the left hand, and that way some two or three miles off I saw a wood of trees, I imagined there might be the Towne; I followed that way, and within a quarter of a mile my Horse beganne to complaine of his poore provender the night before, and to slight me for it; I was fain to light and lead him; and thus againe discouraged with my Horse, and discomforted for the uncertainty of my way, looking about I spied a thatcht house on the one side of the way, and one on Horse-back, who came riding to mee; it was an <hi>Indian</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to that house which was the farme of a rich <hi>Indian,</hi> and Governour of the next Towne, of whom I asked how farre it was to the Town of <hi>Estepeque,</hi> he shewed me the trees, and told me that a little beyond them it stood, and that I should not see it untill I came unto it. With this I got up againe and spurred my sullen jade, untill I reached unto the trees, where he was at a stand and would goe no further. Then I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sadled him, and hid my saddle under some low shrubs, and leaving my horse (whom I feared not that any would steale him) I walked unto the Towne which was not above halfe a mile from thence, where I found my three friends were waiting for me, and grieved for the losse of me, had sent to another Towne to enquire for me; it was the least thought they had that I had been a lodger in the desart. When I related unto them and to the <hi>Indians</hi> the noise and howling that I had heard, the <hi>Indians</hi> answered me that that was common musick to them almost every night, &amp; that they were Wolves and Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gres which they feared not, but did often meet them and with a sticke or hollowing did scare them away, and that they were onely ravenous for their Fowles, Colts, Calves or Kids. After a little discourse I returned with an <hi>Indian</hi> to seeke my Horse and sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, and in that Towne I sould my wearied <hi>Mexican</hi> beast, and hired another to <hi>Ecate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peque</hi> whither we went all four friends again in company. Where note that in this plain and champaigne country of <hi>Tecoantepeque</hi> are five rich and pleasant Townes full of fruits and provision of victuall, all ending in <hi>Tepeque,</hi> to wit, <hi>Tecoantepeque, Estepeque, Ecatepeque, Sanatepeque,</hi> and <hi>Tapanatepeque.</hi> Now from <hi>Ecatepeque</hi> wee could discover the high mountaines of <hi>Quelenes,</hi> which were the subject of most of our discourse to <hi>Sanatepeque,</hi> and from thence to <hi>Tapanatepeque.</hi> For we had been informed by <hi>Spaniards</hi> and Travailers in the way, that they were the most dangerous mountains to travail over that were in all those parts; and that there were on the top of them some passages so narrow, and so high, and so open to the boisterous winds that came from the South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sea, which seemed to lie at the very bottom of them; and on each side of these narrow passages such deep precipices among rocks, that many times it had happened, that the wind blowing furiously had cast downe Mules laden with heavy carriages downe the rockes, and likewise Horse-men had been blown down both Horse and man. The sight of the rockes and mountaines did terrifie us, and the report of them did much affright us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> so that in all this way we did conferre which way to take, whether the rode way to <hi>Guatemala</hi> which lieth under those mountaines along the coast by the Country of <hi>Soco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuzco,</hi> from whence (though out of our way) we might have turned to <hi>Chiapa,</hi> or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we should steer our right course to <hi>Chiapa</hi> over those mountains, which we had been informed, we might safely passe over if the winds did not blow two boisterously. We resolved that when wee came to <hi>Tapanatepeque</hi> we would choose our way according as
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:53246:51"/>
the winds did favour or threaten us, but however to <hi>Chiapa</hi> we would goe, because there we had understood was the Superiour and Provinciall of all the Dominicans of those parts, (to whom we ought to addresse our selves) and also because we would see that famous and much talked of Province of <hi>Chiapa.</hi> In <hi>Sanatepeque</hi> wee met with a Frier who gave us stately entertainment, and from thence gave us <hi>Indians</hi> to guide us to <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panatepeque,</hi> and a letter to the chiefe of the Towne (which also was at his command) to give us Mules to carry us, and <hi>Indians</hi> to guide us up the mountaines. Here the rest of our Horses also failed us, but their wearinesse was no hinderance to us, for the <hi>Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> were willing to give us as much or more then they had cost us, because they were true <hi>Mexican</hi> breed, and all the way we went to <hi>Chiapa</hi> and through that country to <hi>Guatemala</hi> the Towns were to provide us of Mules for nothing. We came to <hi>Tapanatepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que</hi> (which standeth at the bottome and foot of <hi>Quelenes</hi>) on Saturday night, and with the letter we carried were very much welcomed and entertained well by the <hi>Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Towne is one of the sweetest and pleasantest of any we had seen from <hi>Guaxaca</hi> thither, and it seems God hath replenished it with all sorts of comforts which Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailers may need to ascend up those dangerous and steepy rockes. Here is great plenty of cattel for flesh, and rich <hi>Indians</hi> which have farmes, called there <hi>Estantia's,</hi> in some a thousand, in some three or four thousand head of cattell; fowles here are in abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, fish the best store and choisest of any Towne from <hi>Mexico</hi> thither; for the Sea is hard by it, and besides there runneth by it a small river which yeelds divers sorts of fish. From the mountaines there fall so many springs of water, that with them the <hi>Indians</hi> water at their pleasure their gardens which are stored with much herbage and sallets. The shade which defends from the heat (which there is great) is the daughter of most sweet and goodly fruit trees, and of Orange, Lemmon, Citron and Fig leaves. The Sabbath morning was so calme that we desired to make use of it, lest by longer delayes the winds should stay us, or force us to the coast of <hi>Soconusco.</hi> But the <hi>Indians</hi> intreated us to bee their guesse at dinner, not doubting but the weather would hold, and promising us to provide us strong and lusty Mules, and provision of fruits, and fried fish, or fowles, or what our selves desired. We could not refuse this their kind offer, and so stayed dinner with them. After dinner our Mules were brought, and two <hi>Indians</hi> to guide us and carry our provision, which was some fried fish, and a cold rosted Capon, with some fruit as much as might suffice us for a day, for the chief ascent and danger is not above seven leagues, or one and twenty <hi>English</hi> miles, and then beyond the top of the mountaines three miles is one of the richest farms for Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, Mules, and Cattel, in all the Countrey of <hi>Chiapa,</hi> where we knew we should be welcomed by one <hi>Don Iohn de Toledo,</hi> who then lived there. Though these moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines shew themselves with severall sharp pointed heads, and are many joyned together, yet one of them is only mentioned in that Country by the Travailers, which is called <hi>Maquilapa,</hi> over the which lieth the way to <hi>Chiapa.</hi> To this high, steepy, and crag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy <hi>Maquilapa</hi> we tooke our journey after dinner, and were by the proud mountaine that night well entertained, and harboured in a green plot of ground resembling a meadow, which lay as a rib of the one side of that huge and more then <hi>Pyrenian</hi> mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster. The <hi>Indians</hi> comforted us with the shews of faire weather, and told us that they doubted not but the next day at noone we should be at <hi>Don Iohn de Toledo</hi> his <hi>Estancia,</hi> or farme. With this we spread our supper upon the green table-cloth, and at that first meale eat up our Capon and most of the provision of our cold fried fish, leaving only a bit for our mornings breakefast, the springs of water like Conduit-pipes, trickling downe the rockes, gave us melodious musicke to our supper; the <hi>Indians</hi> fed merrily, and our Mules contentedly, and so the fountaine Nymphes sung us asleep till morning, which seemed to us as calme and quiet as the day before, and encouraged us hastily to snatch that bit which we had left and so up from breakefast, to say merrily, upto <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quilapa.</hi> We had not winded the mountaine upwards much above a mile, when the higher we mounted, the more we heard the wind from above whistling unto us, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidding us to goe any further. We were now halfe way up, and doubtfull what wee should doe, whither go forward, or returne to <hi>Tapanatepeque</hi> to eat more fish, or to stay where we were a while untill the weather were more calme, which we thought might be at noone or towards evening. The <hi>Indians</hi> told us that about a mile further there was a fountaine of water, and a lodge made under trees on purpose for Travailers that
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:53246:51"/>
were either benighted or hindred by the winds to compasse their journey up the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine. Thither we went with much adoe, hoping the wind would fall; but still the higher we climbed, the stronger we felt the breath of <hi>Aeolus,</hi> and durst not like the people called <hi>Psilli</hi> (of whom <hi>Herodotus</hi> writeth) march against him, least as they in stead of a victory found a grave in the sands where they met to oppose him, so we in stead of ascending should by a furious blast be made to descend into those deep and horrid precipices, which truely threatned death, and offered themselves to be a grave unto our torne and mangled bodies. We liked the fountaine very well, and the lodge better for the harbour of trees which compassed it about. The wind kept on breathing, and we stood still fearing, till the day was so farre spent that we had no hopes of going back, or forward. Of any supper we despaired that night, who would have been glad now to have picked a bone of a Capons leg, or to have sucked a fishes head, and saw there was nothing for us, but only to feed our hungry stomackes with the remembrance of the plenty the night before. Thus gazing one upon another, and sometimes looking down to the fountaine, sometimes looking up to the trees, we perceived amongst them a Lem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon tree, full of small and very sowre green Lemmons. It was not with us as with <hi>Tantalus</hi> who could neither injoy the fruit above him, nor the waters beneath him; we could and did most greedily catch and snatch the Lemmons, which were sawce for no meate, but onely to fill an empty stomack; with them wee supped and tooke our rest. The next morning the wind was rather stronger then calmer, and we as strong the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond day as the first in our purpose of staying there, and not turning our backes like Cowards. The <hi>Indians</hi> were also willing to stay yet one day longer; so we fell to our breakefast of Lemmons which were somewhat coole to a fasting stomack, and relished nothing the better with a draught from the cleere fountaine. And of what we left on the tree we made our dinner and supper, adding to our water what we saw the <hi>Indians</hi> did drinke, who had their small bags full of powder of their Maiz, of which first ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king cakes as dry as bisket they then grind them to powder, and when they travaile, carry with them that powder to drink with water. This wee thought might bee more nourishing to us, then Lemmons and water onely, and so for that day we bought of them halfe a bagfull of powder giving for it in our want and necessity four rials, or two <hi>English</hi> shillings, which out of <hi>Maquilapa</hi> and that our feare of starving might not be worth above a penny; and yet this was but weake nourishment for our feeble bodies. Thus we waited all Tuesday for the laying of the wind, resolving the next morning ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to goe up the hill, or downe againe to <hi>Tapanatepeque.</hi> But on wednesday morning the wind seeming to be somewhat laid, we purposed to stay till noon hoping then it would be sure travailing; but it ceased not but rather increased a little; whereupon one of our company resolved to goe upwards a mile or two on foot, and trie the passa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and the danger of the wind and to bring us word againe; for we thought our feare might be greater then the danger, who had heard much talke, but had not as yet seen any thing worth our feare. Up therefore went our friend, who staid from us neer two houres, and then returning backe he told us he thought we might get up leading our Mules by the bridles. But what with further questions and debates the time passed away, so that we thought it might be too late; and for that day we put off our journey untill the next morning, resolutely purposing to goe forwards altogether if the wind were not much increased. So that day we fell again to our green crabby Lemmons, wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and Maiz powder, all which we found had much weakned our bodies and feared if we continued there any longer they might hasten our death. Wherefore on Thursday morning (the wind being as the day before) commending our selves first unto the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of that Lord whom the winds and sea obey, we mounted up upon our Mules (leaving our names written in the barke of a great tree, and the dayes we stayed there without food) and so went upward. Wee perceived no great danger in the wind a great while, but some steps and passages upon stony rockes we feared for the narrownesse of them, and there we lighted, thinking our selves safer upon our own two feet, then upon the four feet of a beast. But when we came up to the very top of <hi>Maquilapa</hi> (which signifies in that tongue, A head without haire) we perceived truly the danger so much talked of, and wished our selves again with our green Lemmons in the way to <hi>Tapana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tepeque,</hi> for we found it indeed a head without haire, a top without a tree or branch to shelter a fearfull Traveller<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the passage that lieth open to the sea may be no more than a quarter of a mile, but the height and narrownsse of it stupefieth, for if we looke on
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:53246:52"/>
the one side, there is the wide and spatious South-sea lying so deep and low under it that it dazleth the eies to behold it; if wee looke on the other side, there are rockes of at least six or seven miles depth; whose fight doth make the stoutest and hardest heart (though like themselves) to quake and quiver; so that here the sea expects to swallow, there the rockes threaten to tear with a downfall, and in the midst of those dangers in some places the passage is not above an ell broad. We needed better cordialls for that quarter of a mile then feeding three daies upon green Lemmons and water, and durst not man our selves so much as to goe through it upon our Mules; we lighted, and gave the <hi>Indians</hi> our Mules to lead, and we followed them one by one not daring to walk upright for fear of head giddinesse with looking on either fide, but bowing our bodies we crept upon our hands and feet as neere unto the trackes which beasts and Travailers had made as we could without hindering our going. And when we had got to the end of that passage, and where the mountaine was broader, and the trees promised reliefe, we then looked back boldly, and accused of folly both our selves and all other Travailers that sought no other way though ten miles about, to avoid that danger both for man and beast. From thence joyfully we made haste to <hi>Don Iohn de Toledo,</hi> who made us wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come and gave us some warme broath to comfort our stomacks, which were so weake that no sooner had wee eat any thing, but pesently we cast it up againe; till after ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny sups of broath and wine we recovered strength towards night, and eat our suppers; there we stayed two daies; and thus throughly refreshed wee went to <hi>Acapala</hi> a very great Towne of <hi>Indians</hi> in the Province of <hi>Chiapa,</hi> standing by the same river that passeth by <hi>Chiapa,</hi> which is called <hi>Chiapa de Indios,</hi> or <hi>Chiapa</hi> of the <hi>Indians,</hi> to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish it from another <hi>Chiapa,</hi> called <hi>Chiapa Reall</hi> the Roial <hi>Chiapa,</hi> or <hi>Chiapa de Espanoles, Chiapa</hi> of the <hi>Spaniards.</hi> From <hi>Acapala</hi> we went first to <hi>Chiapa</hi> of the <hi>Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> which standeth almost as low as <hi>Maquilapa</hi> is high, seated upon a river as broad as is the <hi>Thames</hi> at <hi>London,</hi> which hath its spring from the mountaines called <hi>Cuchuma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlanes,</hi> in the rode from <hi>Chiapa Real</hi> to <hi>Guatemala,</hi> and runnes towards the Province of <hi>Zoques,</hi> where it entreth into the river of <hi>Tabasco.</hi> But of this <hi>Chiapa</hi> I will speak a little more in the next Chapter, and now onely say that here we were joyfully enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by those Fryers, who looked upon us as members belonging to the Corporati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of that their Province, and assured us that the Provinciall and chief Superiour would be very glad of our coming, who wanted <hi>Spanish</hi> Fryers to oppose the Criolians and Natives who strived to get a head as they had done in <hi>Mexico</hi> and <hi>Guaxaca.</hi> Here we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood that the Provinciall was not above one daies journey from thence. Here al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so we met with our friend <hi>Peter Borallo,</hi> who had come before us alone, and made his escape from <hi>Mexico:</hi> he comforted us much with the good and kind usage which he had found there; yet he told us how <hi>Calvo</hi> was gone with the rest of his traine from <hi>Mexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co</hi> to <hi>Acapulco,</hi> &amp; from thence was shipped with them to <hi>Philippinas;</hi> but that at his depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture he had writ a letter of bitter complaints unto the Superiour of <hi>Chiapa</hi> and <hi>Guatema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la</hi> against him and us four, desiring the Provinciall not to entertaine us, but to send us backe to <hi>Mexico,</hi> to be shipped from thence the next yeer unto <hi>Philippinas;</hi> which let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was not regarded; but much slighted by the Provinciall. After we had been a week feasted in <hi>Chiapa,</hi> we thought it now fit to present our selves to the Provinciall (whose name was Fryer <hi>Peter Alvarez</hi>) that from him we might receive judgement, and know whether we should stay in that Province, or be forced to return to <hi>Spaine,</hi> for in no other part of <hi>America</hi> we could be entertained. We found the Provinciall in a little Towne called <hi>St. Christopher,</hi> between <hi>Chiapa</hi> of the <hi>Indians</hi> and the Roiall <hi>Chiapa,</hi> recreating himselfe in the shady walkes, which are many sweet and pleasant in that small Towne; where also there is store of fish, and great abundance of rare, and exquisite fruits. He entertained us very lovingly with faire and comfortable words, with a stately dinner and supper, and before we went to bed, to shew his humility hee did unto us what Christ to his Disciples, hee washed our feet. The first day he said little or nothing unto us concerning our continuing in that Country; but the next day he discovered unto us his full resolutions, with many wise and cunning sophismes. For first he read unto us the letter which <hi>Calvo</hi> had writ unto him against us, glossing upon it how ill we had done in forsaking our first love and calling to <hi>Philippinas,</hi> and the danger many <hi>Indian</hi> soules might bee in by reason of our not going thither to convert and instruct them, whose gifts and abilities he supposed might have been more profitable and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable to those souls, then those who in our stead and absence should be sent amongst
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:53246:52"/>
them. And secondly, hee told us how wee had frustrated the King of <hi>Spaines</hi> good hopes of us who had allowed us means and maintenance from <hi>Spain</hi> to <hi>Mexico,</hi> hoping that by us many soules of <hi>Indians</hi> in <hi>Philippinas</hi> might bee saved. Thirdly, hee told us that hee looked upon us as his prisoners, in whose power it was to imprison us, and to send us prisoners to <hi>Mexico</hi> to the Viceroy, to bee shipped from thence to <hi>Manila,</hi> according to <hi>Calvo</hi> his demand. But for the present hee would not let us know what hee meant to doe with us; Onely hee bad us not to bee discouraged, but to be merry and recreate our selves, and that after dinner wee should know more from him, when he had received an answer to a Letter which hee had writ unto the City of <hi>Chiapa</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the disposall of our persons. These reasonings of the grave and old Provinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all did not a little sad our hearts; for the losse of soules, and King of <hi>Spain</hi> his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions and charity charged upon us, and imprisonment spoke of by the by, were words which seemed of a very high straine, and so could hardly bee digested by us; this mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings breakfast had quite taken away from us our stomack to our dinner. And thus wee departed from the presence of the venerable Fryer <hi>Peter Alvarez,</hi> and betooke our selves to a shady walke under Orange trees belonging to the house where this Superiour was. In this shade wee conferred with our selves upon the words of <hi>Alvarez,</hi> and finding them of so high a nature, as involving soules, a King, and imprisonment, we thought verily wee should bee sent back to <hi>Mexico,</hi> and from thence like fugitive slaves bee forced to <hi>Philippinas.</hi> Here my hopes of ever more seeing <hi>England</hi> were lost; <hi>Antonio Melendez</hi> his heart panted, wished himself again upon the highest top of <hi>Maquilapa;</hi> another wished himselfe with old <hi>Calvo</hi> at Sea sailing to <hi>Manila,</hi> though it were but to help him scrape his rusty Gammons of Bacon.</p>
               <p>The motion was made to make an escape from <hi>Alvarez,</hi> as wee had done from <hi>Calvo;</hi> but to this answer was made, that whither so ever wee went, not knowing the Country, wee should bee discovered; and that put case the worst, wee should bee sent to <hi>Mexico,</hi> wee might better escape in the way, then there where wee were. At last I told the rest, that I could conceive no hard nor harsh usage from that smiling and loving countenance of the Provinciall, nor after that his low and humble act of washing our feet the night before; and that I thought verily hee wished us well for having come so far to offer our selves for fellow-labourers in that harvest of souls belonging to his charge, and whom wee knew wanted s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>tch as we were newly come from <hi>Spain</hi> to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose the Criolians or Natives faction in that Province; alleadging furthermore the example of our friend and companion <hi>Peter Borallo,</hi> whom hee had already incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated into that Province, and could doe no lesse with us without partiality and accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of persons. And lastly, my opinion was, that in case wee ought not to be enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained there, yet the Provinciall would not send us back to <hi>Mexico,</hi> there to be disgraced and affronted, but would give way unto us to returne to <hi>Spain,</hi> or whither else wee would, with some relief and mony in our purses. Whilst wee were thus troubled, and in this sad and serious discourse, old <hi>Alvarez</hi> it seemes had been eying of us from his window, and as <hi>Ioseph</hi> could not long suppresse and keep in the expressions of a loving and tender heart unto his brethren; so this good Superior perceiving that we were trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with what he had said unto us, sent his companion unto us to comfort us; which wee easily perceived by his discourse when hee came unto us. For as soone as hee came hee asked us why wee were so sad and melancholy? hee told us, the Provinciall also had observed that wee were troubled. But, said hee, bee of good cheare; bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident that the Provinciall wisheth you very well, and needeth such as you are, and having come into his Dominion to thrust your selves upon his mercy, by harsh and unkind usage hee will not doe what Martiall Law forbids a hard hearted Souldier to doe unto his enemy upon such termes. Many such comfortable words did he speak unto us; and told us further that the Provinciall had been much censured by the Criolian party for entertaining of <hi>Peter Borallo;</hi> and that now they would stir worse seeing four more come to weaken their faction; and therefore hee desired to bee well advised concerning us, and to carry our businesse with such discretion, as might give little offence to those who were apt to judge and censure the best of all his actions. And finally hee did as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure us, that wee should never bee sent back as prisoners to <hi>Mexico</hi> by the Provinciall, who in case hee could not entertaine us in <hi>Chiapa,</hi> or <hi>Guatemala,</hi> would further us with all his favour, and friends, and money in our purses to return againe to <hi>Spain.</hi> These reasons were heart fainting Cordials unto us, and stomack preparatives to a
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:53246:53"/>
good dinner, to which by the sound of a bell wee were invited. When wee came in, the loving, smiling, and fatherly countenance of the good Provinciall did chear us more then all the cheare that waited for us upon the table in severall dishes, all which were seasoned to our palates with the sauce of the comfort, which the Provincials messenger had brought unto us in the shady Orange walke in the garden. The great provision of fish and flesh, with fruits and sweet meats were yet to us a strong argument that wee were very welcome; for what wee sed on that day, might well become a Noble mans Table; Besides in many passages of our discourse wee perceived that good old <hi>Alvarez</hi> his heart was over joyed with our comming to him. Dinner being ended the Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall desired to play a game at Tables with us round about, saying hee would not win our money, because hee judged us poore after so long a journey. But thus hee setled the game and sport; that if he did win, we should say for him five <hi>Pater Nosters,</hi> and five <hi>Ave Maries;</hi> but if wee wun, wee should win our admittance, and Incorporation in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that Province. This sport pleased us well, for our winnings wee judged would be to us more profitable at that time, then to winne pounds, and our loosings we valued not; besides wee were confident all went well with us, when from the favour of the Dice, wee might challenge that favour which with many weary journeys wee had come to seek above foure hundred miles. The sport began, and wee young blades taking one by one our turnes were too hard for the old man, who (as wee perceived) would willingly bee the loser, that his very losses might speak unto us what through policy and discretion hee would not utter with words. Yet wee boldly challenged our winnings, which as soone as wee had ended our game were now surely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed unto us by the returne of an <hi>Indian</hi> messenger, who that morning had been sent to the City of <hi>Chiapa</hi> for advice and counsell from the Prior and the chiefe of the Cloister concerning our disposal, and now was returned with an answer from the Prior, who in his letter expressed great joy unto the Provinciall for our comming, and so from the rest of the Seniors of the Cloister, and did earnestly begge of the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour, that hee would send us to him to bee his guesse, for that our case had beene his owne some ten yeers before, for hee had also at <hi>Mexico</hi> forsaken his company to <hi>Philippinas,</hi> and fled to <hi>Guatemala,</hi> where for his learning and good parts hee had been as a stranger much envied by the Criolian faction; but now hee hoped hee should have some to side with him against such as spighted and maligned him. Old <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varez</hi> was much taken with his letter, and told us hee must pay what hee had lost, and that the next day he would send us to <hi>Chiapa,</hi> there to abide untill hee tooke further care of us, to send us to other parts of the Country, to learne the <hi>Indian</hi> languages, that wee might preach unto them. This discourse being ended wee betooke our selves again to the Garden which smelled more of comfort then before dinner, and to our shady walks which now offered us a safer protection then they had done in the forenoone, countenancing that protection which we had gained from the Provinciall.</p>
               <p>Here we began to praise God, who had looked upon us in our low estate, not forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the wise and politick Provinciall, who though hee had lost his games for our comfort, wee would not hee should lose our prayers, which there wee offered up to God for his health and safety. And so till supper time wee continued our discourse in the Garden fuller of mirth and pleasant jests, then wee had done before dinner, snatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now and then at the Oranges and Lemmons, which were there both sowre and sweet, eating of some, and casting some one at another, but especially at him who had wished himselfe with <hi>Calvo</hi> dressing his rusty Bacon, whom we strived to beat out of the garden by force of Orange and Lemmon bullets; which sport we continued the more willingly, because wee perceived the good Provinciall stood behind a Lattice in a Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cony beholding us, and rejoycing to see our hearts so light and merry. Wee had no sooner beat <hi>Calvo</hi> his friend out of the garden, when the bell to supper founded a retreat to us all, and called us again to meet our best friend <hi>Alvarez,</hi> who had fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished us a Table againe like that at noone. After supper hee told us that the next mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning hee would send us to <hi>Chiapa,</hi> for that the Prior had writ unto him he would meet us in the way with a Breakfast at a Towne called St. <hi>Philip;</hi> wherewith wee conceited very highly of our selves to see that Provincialls and Priors were so forward to feast us. Yet before we went to bed, the Provinciall would try again a game at Tables with every one of us, to see if now hee could beat us that had been too hard for him at noon. The matter of our game was now altered, and what we played for was this; if the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinciall
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:53246:53"/>
wun, wee were to bee his prisoners, (which mystery wee understood not till the next day, for the old man was crafty and Politick, and knew hee could winne of us when he listed, for hee was an excellent gamester at Tables) but if wee wun of him, hee was to give us a box of <hi>Chocolatte,</hi> which was a drinke wee liked very well. The Game went on, and wee every one of us one by one were losers, yet understood not how wee should bee his prisoners, but slighted our losses. Yet for all this the merry Provinciall told us, hee was sory wee had lost, and wished wee might never bee prison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to a worse enemie then hee; and that wee should perceive it, hee would comfort us each one as a prisoner with a box of <hi>Chocolatte,</hi> to drinke for his sake, and to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort our hearts, when most wee should find them discomforted for our losses. Wee un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood not his meaning till the next day at noone, but thought it was a jest and a word of sport and mirth, like many such like which in his discourse had come from him.</p>
               <p>With this wee tooke our leaves, and went to bed with light and herry hearts. In the morning two Mules of the Provinciall and two of his Companion were sadled for us, and at least a dozen <hi>Indians</hi> on horse back waited for us to conduct us up a steepy hill and through woods to the Towne of St. <hi>Philip.</hi> After our breakfast the good Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinciall imbraced us, and bad us farewell, desiring us to pray for him; and not to bee discouraged by any thing that might befall us, assuring us hee wished us very well, and would doe what lay in his power for our good; yet so, that hee must use policy and discretion to stop the mouths of the Criolians, whom hee knew hated both him and us. Thus we departed with Waits and Trumpets sounding before us, which rebounded an Echo all the way up the hill from us to old <hi>Alvarez</hi> whom we had left in a low bottome compassed about with hils on every side. Wee had no sooner ascended up to the top of the Mountaine, when we discovered a little Valley, and in it the City of <hi>Chiapa</hi> of the <hi>Spaniards;</hi> with two or three small Villages, of which one was St. <hi>Philip</hi> at the bottom of the Mountaine, which we were to descend. The Trumpets which still went sound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before us were a sufficient and loud Alarme to St. <hi>Philips</hi> Inhabitants of our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and a warning for the speedier hastening of our second breakfast, for the which the cold morning aire (which wee found somewhat piercing upon the Mountaine) had whetted and through prepared our stomacks. We had not got down the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine halfe a mile, when wee met with a matter of twenty gallant <hi>Indians</hi> on horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back with their trumpeters sounding before them, and behind them came upon a stately Mule the Prior of <hi>Chiapa,</hi> (whose name was Father <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi>) a merry fat Fryer, who calling us his brethren fugitives from <hi>Philippinas,</hi> told us wee were welcome to that country, and to him especially, and that in the next St. <hi>Philip</hi> he would shew us bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter sport, then any St. <hi>Philip</hi> in all the <hi>Philippinas</hi> Islands could have shewed us, if wee had gone thither. Thus with a pleasant discourse, and many merry conceits from the good Prior wee soone came downe the hill, where the whole Village of St. <hi>Philip</hi> waited for us both men and women, some presenting unto us nosegaies, others burling Roses and other flowers in our faces, others dancing before us all along the street, which was strowed with herbes and Orange leaves, and adorned with many Arches made with flowers and hung with garlands for us to ride under untill wee came to the Church, where for halfe an houre wee were welcomed with the best musick from the City of <hi>Chiapa,</hi> which the Prior had hired to come with him to entertaine us. Our Musick being ended, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

But whilst all this was gallantly performed by the Prior, it was a hard Riddle unto us, what hee often repeated unto u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> saying, Brethren break your fast well, for your dinner will be the meanest as ever yee did eate in your lives, and now enjoy this sweet liberty which will not last long unto you. Wee observed the words, but
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:53246:54"/>
knew not what to make of them, till wee came unto the Cloister. After our breakfast the <hi>Indians</hi> shewed us a little sport in the Market place, running races on horse-back, and playing at <hi>Iuego de Canna's;</hi> which is to meet on horseback, with broad Targets to defend their heads and shoulders while passing by they hurle Canes, or darts one at a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, which those <hi>Indians</hi> acted with great dexterity.</p>
               <p>Thus the good Prior of <hi>Chiapa</hi> feasted us, and permitted us to injoy our liberty as long as it seemes it had beene agreed upon by letters between him and the Provinciall, which was till it might be dinner time in the Cloister of <hi>Chiapa,</hi> where wee were to bee before noone. The time drew neere, and we had from St. <hi>Philip</hi> to the City of <hi>Chiapa</hi> some two <hi>English</hi> miles to ride; Wherefore the Prior commanded our Mules to bee brought; the waits and trumpets gave warning to the Town of our departure; and so with many horsemen, with dances, Musick and ringing of Bells wee were as stately and joyfully conducted out of the Town, as wee had been inducted into it. At the first halfe miles end the Prior gave thankes unto the <hi>Indians,</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired them to return, the Cloister being neer where wee expected another kinde of entertainment, not using in the City and Cloister that pompe and state, which in the Country might bee allowed. The <hi>Indians</hi> tooke their leaves of us; and on we went with onely two as guides before us. Within halfe a mile of the City, the Prior and a companion of his stopped, and tooke out of his pocket an order from the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinciall, which he read unto us, to this effect, That whereas we had forsaken our law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Superior <hi>Calvo</hi> in the way to <hi>Philippinas,</hi> and without his licence had come unto the Province of <hi>Chiapa,</hi> hee could not in conscience but inflict some punishment upon us before he did enable us to abide there as members under him; therefore hee did strict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly command the Prior of <hi>Chiapa,</hi> that as soone as wee should enter into his Cloister, hee should shut us up two by two in our chambers, as in prisons, for three daies, not suffering us to goe out to any place, save onely to the publick place of refection (called Refectory) where all the Fryers met together to dine and sup, where at noon time we were to present our selves before all the Cloisters sitting upon the bare ground, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>nd there to receive no other dinner, but only bread and water; but at supper we might have in our chambers, or Prisons, what the Prior would be pleased to allow us. This was the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance enjoined upon us by the wise and cunning Provinciall. This newes at the first was but sowre sawee, or a dry Postpast after a double sumptuous breakfast; it was a dolefull ditty to us after our Musick, and dances, to heare of a treble fast after our feast; to heare of imprisonment after so great liberty. We now began to remember the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincialls winnings at Tables the night before, and the mystery thereof, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to thinke how comfortable his boxes of <hi>Chocolatte</hi> would be unto us after a meale of bread and water. Now wee called to minde the short dinner the Prior had told us at St. <hi>Philips</hi> wee were like to have that day, and of the liberty hee bad us then make much of. But the good Prior seeing us sad upon a suddaine, and our countenances changed, smiled upon us, wishing us not to thinke the worse of him, nor of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinciall, who did that out of Policy, and to stop the Criolians mouths, whom he knew would murmur, if no punishment were inflicted upon us. Hee assured us, after our im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisonment, of honours and preferments, and that as long as wee were with him, wee should want no incouragement; and that after a bread and water dinner hee could send us to our chambers a Supper, that should strongly support our empty stomacks, and furre and line them well for the next foure and twenty houres. With these incouragements on wee went to the Cloister of <hi>Chiapa,</hi> where wee were welcomed by most of the Fry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, but in some few wee noted a frowning and disaffected countenance. We were no sooner conducted to our chambers, when the bell sounded to dinner for the rest, and cryed aloud to us Penance with bread and water.

But thirdly, it was our comfort that at that very time a Criolian Frier also sate upon the ground with us (of whose company we had been informed by some friends be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore wee went into the refectory) for some love letters which had been intercepted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween him and a Nun of that City, tending to much uncivility, and breaking their oath of professed chastity. But when I perceived this Frier to looke discontentedly upon us, I chose my place as neer unto him as I could, and hearing him mutter with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in himselfe against us, calling us disobedient <hi>Philippinian Ionahs,</hi> I softly and friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly spoke unto him with these two following Hexameters, which suddenly came unto my mind about his misdemeanor.</p>
               <lg>
                  <l>Si Monialis Amor te <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <l>Ecce tibi frigidae praebent medicamina lymphae.</l>
               </lg>
               <p>But my good neighbour snuffing and puffing at my suddain muse, seemed to be more discontented then before, and would faine withdraw himselfe by degrees from mee, not rising up (for that was not lawfull to doe till dinner had been ended) but wrigling his elbowes and shoulders scornefully from me, whom in like manner I followed, clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving friendly to him with this verse,</p>
               <q>Solamen misero est socios retinere Panettes,</q>
               <p>Hee thought I followed him to steale away his loafe from him. This new found word, <hi>Panettes,</hi> had almost choaked him, had not hee made use of the medicinall water which stood before him; of the which he dranke a good draught, whereby I perceived his courage against me and my friends was tamed, and I told him, I hoped his burning want on love was cooled.</p>
               <p>Thus with my Criolian neighbours company my bread and water went down cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully; and dinner being ended, we were again conducted to our chambers, where we dranke a cup of old <hi>Alvarez</hi> his <hi>Chocolatte.</hi> The <hi>Castilian</hi> Friers flocked unto our prisons, some to talke with us, some bringing us conserves and sweet-meats, others other dainties, which they had prepared to helpe our digestion of bread and cold wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. My suddain verses to my Criolian neighbour were presently noysed about the Cloister, and were the chiefe subject of our talke that afternoone. Our supper was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for us according to the promise and generous spirit of the Prior, who also ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured our prison that night with his owne and two other Friers company supping with us all in one chamber together. And thus we passed our three daies of imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment merrily and contentedly, wishing we might never suffer harder usage in any prison then we had done in this, which was not to us such a punishment as did bring with it the privation of any liberty of enjoying the company of friends, of feasting with them, but onely the privation of the liberty of our legs to walke about those three daies; and this rather an ease then a punishment, for that we wanted rather rest, then much stirring after so long and tedious a journey as we had compassed from <hi>Mexico</hi> thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. We were no sooner set at liberty, but we presently found the Provinciall and Prior ready to dispose of us so, that in lieu of our imprisonment we might receive honor and credit.

               <p>This Country is divided into three Provinces, to wit, <hi>Chiapa, Zeldales,</hi> and <hi>Zoques;</hi> whereof <hi>Chiapa</hi> it selfe is the poorest. This containes the great Towne of <hi>Chiapa</hi> of the <hi>Indians,</hi> and all the Townes and farmes North-ward towards <hi>Maquilapa,</hi> and West-ward the Priory of <hi>Comitlan,</hi> which hath some ten Townes, and many farmes of Cattle, Horses, and Mules subject unto it; and neighbouring unto it lieth the great valley of <hi>Capanabastla,</hi> which is another Priory reaching towards <hi>Soconuzco.</hi> This val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley glorieth in the great river, which hath its spring from the mountaines called <hi>Cuchu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matlanes,</hi> and runneth to <hi>Chiapa</hi> of the <hi>Indians,</hi> and from thence to <hi>Tabasco.</hi> It is also famous for the abundance of fish, which the river yeeldeth, and the great store of Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell which from thence minister food and provision both to the City of <hi>Chiapa,</hi> and to all the adjacent Townes. Though <hi>Chiapa</hi> the City, and <hi>Comitlan</hi> as standing upon the hils, bee exceeding cold, yet this valley lying low is extraordinary hot, and from <hi>May</hi> to <hi>Michaelmas</hi> is subject to great stormes and tempests of thunder and lightning. The head Towne where the Priory stands, is called <hi>Copanabastla,</hi> consisting of above eight hundred <hi>Indian</hi> inhabitants. But greater than this is <hi>Izquintenango</hi> at the end of the valley and at the foot of the mountaines of <hi>Cuchumatlanes</hi> Southward. And yet bigger then this is the Towne of <hi>St. Bartholomew</hi> Northward at the other end of the valley, which in length is about fourty miles, and ten or twelve onely in breadth. All the rest of the Townes lie towards <hi>Soconuzco<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> and are yet hotter and more subject to thunder and lightning, as drawing neerer unto the South-sea coast. Besides the abundance of cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell, the chiefe commoditie of this valley consisteth in Cotton-wooll, whereof are made such store of mantles for the <hi>Indians</hi> wearing, that the Merchants far and neer come for them. They exchange them to <hi>Soconuzco</hi> and <hi>Xuchutepeques</hi> for <hi>Cacao,</hi> whereby they are well stored of that drinke. So that the inhabitants want neither fish which) they have from the river) nor flesh (for that the valley abounds with Cattell) nor clothing (for of that they spare to others) nor bread, though not of wheat, for there growes none; but <hi>Indian</hi> Maiz they have plenty of; and besides they are exceedingly stored with fowles and Turkeys, fruits, Hony, Tobacco and Sugar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canes.

Neither is mony here nor in <hi>Chiapa</hi> so plentifull as in <hi>Mexico</hi> and <hi>Guaxaca;</hi> and whereas there they reckon by Patacones, or pieces of Eight; here they reckon by Tostones which are but halfe Patacones. Though the river be many waies profitable to that valley, yet it is cause of many disasters to the inhabitants, who lose many times their children, and their Calves and Colts drawing neere to the water-side, where they are devoured by Cayman<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>s, which are many and greedy of flesh, by reason of the many prizes they have got. The City of <hi>Chiapa Real,</hi> is one of the meanest Cities in all <hi>America,</hi> consisting of not above four hundred housholders <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and about an hundred houses of <hi>Indians</hi> joyning to the City, and called <hi>el barrio de los Indios,</hi> who have a Chappell by themselves. In this City there is no Parish Church, but onely the Cathedrall, which is mother to all the inhabitants. Besides, there are two Cloisters, one of Dominicans, and the other of Franciscans, and a poore Cloister of Nuns, which are burdensome enough to that City. But the Jesuites having got no footing there (who commonly live in the richest and wealthiest places and Cities) is a sufficient ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of either the poverty of that City, or of want of gallant parts, and prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gality in the gentry, from whose free and generous spirits they like Horse-leeches are still sucking extraordinary and great almes for the Colledges where they live; but here the Merchants are close handed, and the Gentlemen hard, and sparing, wanting of wit and Courtiers parts and bravery, and so poore <hi>Chiapa</hi> is held no fit place for Jesuites. The Merchants chiefe trading there is in <hi>Cacao,</hi> Cotton-wool from the adjacent parts of the Country, in Pedlers small wares, and in some Sugar from about <hi>Chiapa</hi> of the <hi>Indians,</hi> in a little <hi>Cochinil;</hi> for commonly the Governour (whose chiefe gaine consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steth in this) will not suffer them to be too free in this commoditie, lest they hinder his greedy traffique. These have their shops all together in a little Market-place before the Cathedrall Church, built with walkes and Porches, under which the poore <hi>Indian</hi> wives meet at five a clock at evening to sell what slap and drugges they can prepare most cheape for the empty Criolian stomackes. The richer sort of these Merchants go and send yet further to <hi>Tabasco</hi> for wares from <hi>Spaine,</hi> such as wines, Linnen cloth, Figs, Raisins, Olives, and Iron, though in these commodities they dare not venture too much, by reason the <hi>Spaniards</hi> in that Country are not very many, and those that are there, are such as are loath to open their purses to more then what may suffice nature. So that what are <hi>Spanish</hi> commodities are chiefly brought for the Friers who are the best and joviallest blades of that Countrey. The Gentlemen of <hi>Chiapa</hi> are a by word all about that Country, signifying great Dons (<hi>dones,</hi> gifts or abilities I should say) great birth, phantasticke pride, joyned with simplicity, ignorance, misery and penu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. These Gentlemen will say they descend from some Dukes house in <hi>Spain,</hi> and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately from the first Conquerors; yet in carriage they are but clownes, in wit, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitics, parts and discourse as shallow brained, as a low brooke, whose waters are scarce able to leap over a pibble stone; any small reason soone tries and tires their weak braine, which is easily at a stand when sense is propounded, and slides on speedily when non-sense carrieth the streame. The chiefe families in this City, are named, <hi>Cortez, Solis, Velasco, Toledo, Zerna,</hi> and <hi>Mendoza.</hi> One of these, who was thought the chiefe in my time, called <hi>Don Melchor de Velasco,</hi> one day fell into discourse with mee concerning <hi>England,</hi> and our <hi>English</hi> nation, and in the best, most serious and judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous part of his Don-like conference, asked me whether the sun and moone in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> were of the same colour as in <hi>Chiapa,</hi> and whether <hi>English</hi> men went barefoot like the <hi>Indians,</hi> and sacrificed one another as formerly did the Heathens of that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey? and whether all <hi>England</hi> could afford such a dainty as a dish of Frixoles (which is the poorest <hi>Indians</hi> daily food there, being black and dry Turkey or French beanes boyled with a little biting Chille or <hi>Indian</hi> pepper with garlicke, till the broath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come as black as any Inke) And whether the women in <hi>England</hi> went as long with child, as did the <hi>Spanish</hi> women? And lastly, whether the <hi>Spanish</hi> nation were not a farre gallanter nation then the <hi>English?</hi> When I perceived my Don ran farther and farther into his simple and foolish questions, I cut him off suddenly, telling him, Sir, It is long since I came out of <hi>England,</hi> if you give me leave to recollect my memory, I will answer some of these your hard questions the next time we meet (thinking hereby to try my Dons wit further, whether he could perceive I jeared him.) To which my simple Don replyed, I pray Sir doe, and whensoever you come, you shall be welcome to a dish of Frixoles. With this I tooke my leave of him, and at our farewell, he againe desired
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:53246:56"/>
mee to study well his questions, and to return him a speedy answer, whereby I was more confirmed in my conceit of my <hi>Don,</hi> that he was either <hi>tonto</hi> or <hi>bobo,</hi> foole or simple. Yet thought I my best way to answer is to answer a fool according to his folly, and so resolved within two or three daies to return unto him some simple answer according to his simple and foolish questions. Therefore speedily I singled out a good occasion of meeting with him at his own house, who welcomed me with much <hi>Spanish</hi> gravity, and sitting down before <hi>Donna Angela,</hi> his painted wife and Angel; began to answer, or more to jeer his <hi>Donship.</hi> I began with the Sun and Moon, telling him that they were planets, &amp; had their speciall influences upon severall nations, as all planets have upon mans body. And so they did shew themselves according to the inclination of the people of severall King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes. And therefore as the <hi>Spaniards</hi> were much inclined to <hi>Venus</hi> and to beauty, and not contenting themselves with the naturall beauty of their faire Ladies, would yet have Art add to nature by the skill and use of the best painting colours; so these glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious planets of the Sun and Moon among the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and especially in <hi>Chiapa,</hi> shewed themselves most comely, bright, glorious and beautifull, working the like in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination to beauty upon, and in all <hi>Spaniards.</hi> My instance was in the land of the Blackmores, where I told them that their bodies were black, and that among them the Sun appeared with a dark and sad visage. Here my <hi>Don</hi> cried out; An excellent example. I gave him yet a second instance from the Eclipse of the Sun; which being eclipsed, made all the Earth, mens faces and bodies seeme of a darke, or yellow co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, to shew the proportion or sympathy of sublunary odies to that high and overmaste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring plnet. To this that good <hi>Don</hi> replyed; <hi>sennor no se puede decirmas,</hi> sir, nothing can be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered or said more or better. <hi>Vengamos agora a Ingalatierra,</hi> Let us draw now to <hi>England.</hi> To which I answered him, that in <hi>England</hi> the Sun and Moon appeared halfe yeer of one colour, and half of another; for the women one half yeer it appeared as in <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Chiapa,</hi> beautifull and glorious, for that naturally without painting they yeelded to none in beauty. But the other half yeer it appeared as red as blood, or scar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let; and the reason might easily bee guessed at, for that no Nation is more warlik and high spirited then the <hi>English,</hi> whose very clothes were fiery, wearing more scarlet then any nation in the World; a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Here my <hi>Don</hi> jogged his head, and replyed; Sir, I thought no nation had been so like the Sun as the <hi>Spaniards;</hi> for I have read that when our Ancestors came to conquer these parts, the <hi>Indians</hi> called them, <hi>hijos del Sol,</hi> that is, sons of the Sun, being comely and gallant, and more like the Sun then any other people. To this I answered him. Sir, no doubt but you are like the Sun here, and none more glittering and bright, your very hatbands shining with Pearls and Diamonds like the brightnesse of the Sun; But as I said before the Blackmores are like their Sun, so I say, the <hi>English</hi> is like their Sun, which is red, and so doe and will affect to wear Scarlet, as long as any <hi>Cochinill</hi> is to be found in the <hi>India's.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now <hi>Don Melchor</hi> began to understand mee, and told mee, never man had satisfied him with better reasons then my self. Hee thanked mee heartily, and told mee, hee thought no Gentleman in <hi>Chiapa</hi> could tell so well as himself now why the <hi>English</hi> ships came so much upon their Coasts; and that my discourse had satisfied him to the full. Hee desired mee to goe on to his other questions. To his second de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding whether the <hi>English</hi> went barefoot like the <hi>Indians,</hi> I told him I thought that the Count of <hi>Gondomar,</hi> (who had been many yeers Ambassadour from <hi>Spain</hi> in <hi>England</hi>) had satisfied all the <hi>Spaniards</hi> that doubt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who coming from <hi>England</hi> to <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drid,</hi> and being there asked by some Courtiers, whether <hi>London</hi> was as big as <hi>Madrid,</hi> and as well peopled, he made answer, that hee thought there was scarce a hundred left in <hi>London.</hi> Hee proved it from the use and custome of his own Countrymen of <hi>Spain;</hi> who when they are to make a journey, shew themselves two or three daies before in colours, walking with boots and spurs, that their friends may take notice that they are departing out of the Towne or City. So said the Count of <hi>Gondomar,</hi> I think by this there are very few People in <hi>London;</hi> for when I came from thence I left them all almost in cloaths of colours, bo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>d and spurred as ready to depart and take some
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:53246:56"/>
journey. And truely my <hi>Don</hi> (quoth I) your owne Count hath answered for mee; yet I say, the <hi>English</hi> are so farre from going barefoot, that they goe booted, and are all in a readinesse to move out of <hi>England</hi> for any noble and generous designe; but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all they are still ready for <hi>America,</hi> where they know is store and abundance of Hydes to make them Bootes to cover the barenesse of their legges, that they may not be suspected to be like bare-footed <hi>Indians.</hi> Here <hi>Don Melchor</hi> replyed, I pray sir, when they come by Sea to these parts doe they come also booted and spurred? For I should thinke, when they fight, their spurs should hinder them. To this his doubt I answered first, as concerning spurres in the ships, with the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of one of his own Nation, and of the best Divines in <hi>Spain,</hi> living in my time in <hi>Valladolid,</hi> called <hi>Maestro Nunno,</hi> (Reader of Divinity in the Colledge of St. <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorie,</hi> but in his carriage and experience in the World a simple noddy) who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing invited by a Noble man to goe with him in his Coach out of the City a mile or two to a garden of recreation, went hastily about the Colledge to borrow boots and spurs; and when he had put them on, being asked whither he went, and why he put on boots and spurs, answered that he was to goe in a Coach out of the City, and that hee thought the Coach and Mules would want spurs to goe and come the sooner. Even so my <hi>Don</hi> (quoth I) the <hi>English</hi> men come booted and spurred in their ships, to make their ships sail on the swifter. And this is the reason why the <hi>English</hi> ships saile faster, and when they are in fight turn about quicker then a <hi>Spanish</hi> Galeon, because they are spurred &amp; kicked within. O sir, I humbly thank you (said <hi>Don Melchor</hi>) for that by your discourse now I know the truth of what indeed I have often heard say, that the <hi>English</hi> ships are nimbler, and quicker at Sea then our heavy Galeons. Now as for fighting the <hi>English</hi> mens spurs (said I) are no hinderance to them, but rather a great advantage. For they fight with weapons, with their hands and with their feet, wherein they exceed the <hi>Spaniards;</hi> for when they have shot with their peeces, or cut down with their swords any enemy, or knocked him with their holbards, then with their feet and spurres, they fall upon him, and so soone rid him out of the way, that hee may no more rise up against them. All you have told mee (said the wise <hi>Velazco</hi>) stands with so much reason, that my judgment is convinced by you. As for eating and sacrificing one another like the <hi>Indians</hi> (I told him) that the <hi>English</hi> filled their bellies so well with fat Beef and Mutton, fowles, Rabbits, Partridges and Pheasants, that they had no stomacke at all to mans flesh. And that truly for frixoles dressed with garlick, that onely daintie dish was wanting in <hi>England;</hi> and that for Garlick, three reasons moved the <hi>English</hi> not to bee lavishing of that little they had; first, for feare they should want it for their horses drenches; secondly, for that they felt not themselves so much troubled with the wind, nor puffed up with windy and vaine conceits as other nations did; but thirdly and chiefly they refrained from it among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, that they might not smell of it, and that by the sent and smell of it a farre off at Sea they might when they came to the Coast of <hi>America,</hi> smell out a <hi>Spanish</hi> ship, and know it from a <hi>Hollander.</hi> Here my <hi>Don Melchor</hi> fell into admiration, as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suring mee, hee had never heard more solid reasons from any man. Alas poore Criolian of <hi>Chiapa</hi> (thought I) if I had spoken sense, thy shallow braine had not beene able to have leaped over it, but after non-sense thou art easily carried away. As for his last question, I told him that was above my reach, for that poore Fryers ought not to meddle with women, neither had my mother ever told mee how long shee went with mee. But how ever if <hi>Donna Angella</hi> would tell mee how long shee went with her children, I would by the constellations of the Heavens search out against our next meeting, how long the <hi>English</hi> women went with their children. To this my <hi>Don Melchor</hi> answered that he would not trouble me to study what he thought was not belonging to my profession; but he knew that if I would study that or any other hard &amp; difficult point, I could give him more &amp; better satisfaction then any scholar in that City.</p>
               <p>And thus (Reader) by this Don <hi>Melchors</hi> wit and ability would I have thee judge of the Gentlemen Criolians or natives of <hi>Chiapa;</hi> and yet as presumptuous they are and arrogant, as if the noblest bloud in the Court of <hi>Madrid</hi> ran through their veines. It is a common thing amongst them to make a dinner only with a dish of Frixoles in black broath, boyled with pepper and garlicke, saying it is the most nourishing meat in all the <hi>India's;</hi> and after this so stately a dinner they will be sure to comeout to the street<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore of their houses to see and to be seen, and there for halfe an houre will they stand
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:53246:57"/>
shaking off the crums of bread from their cloaths, bands (but especially from their ruffes when they used them) and from their mustachoes. And with their tooth-pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers they will stand picking their teeth, as if some small Partridge bone stuck in them; nay if a friend passe by at that time, they will be sure to find out some crum or other in their mustacho (as if on purpose the crums of the table had been shaken upon their beards, that the losse of them might be a gaining of credit for great house keeping) and they will be sure to vent out some non-truth, as to say, <hi>A Senor que linda perdiz he comido oy,</hi> O Sir, what a dainty Partridge have I eat to day, where as they picke out nothing from their teeth but a black husk of a dry frixole or Turkey bean. Though great in blood and in birth they say they are, yet in their imployments they are but rich Grasiers, for most of their<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> wealth consisteth in farmes of Cattell and Mules. Some indeed have Townes of <hi>Indians</hi> subject unto them, whereof they are called En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comendero's, and receive yeerly from every <hi>Indian</hi> a certaine Pole tribute of fowles and mony. They have most cowardly spirits for warre, and though they will say, they would faine see <hi>Spaine,</hi> yet they dare not venture their lives at sea; they judge sleeping in a whole skin the best maxime for their Criolian spirits. One hundred figh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting souldiers would easily lay low those <hi>Chiapa Dons,</hi> and gain the whole City, which lyeth so open to the fields, that the Mules and Asses come in and grase, the streets being very commodious to entertain Asses from within, and from without. Yet in this City li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth commonly a Governour, or Alcalde Major, and a Bishop. The Governours place is of no small esteem and interest, for that his power reacheth farre, and he tradeth much in Cacao and Cochinil, and domineers over both <hi>Spaniards</hi> and <hi>Indians</hi> at his will and pleasure. But ill gotten goods never thrive, as was seen in <hi>Don Gabriel de Orellana</hi> (Governour of this City and Countrey in my time) who having sent the worth of eight thousand crownes in Cochinil, Cacao, Sugar, and Hydes by the river of <hi>Tabas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co</hi> towards the <hi>Havana</hi> lost it all into the hands of the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> who doubtlesse knew how to make better use of it, then would have done that tyrannizing Governour. The Bishops place of that City is worth at least eight thousand duckats a yeer, which truly he had need of that comes so far from <hi>Spain</hi> to live in such a City where are such able <hi>Dons,</hi> as <hi>Don Melchor de Velasco,</hi> and where Asses are so freely fed and bred. Most of this Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops revenues consisteth in great offerings which he yeerly receiveth from the great <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian</hi> Townes, going out to them once a yeer to confirme their children, whose confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation is such a means to confirme and strengthen the Bishops revenues, that none must be confirmed by him who offer not a faire white Wax-candle, with a ribban and at least foure Rials. I have seen the richer sort offer him a Candle of at least six pound weight with two yards of twelve penny broad ribban, and the Candle stucke from the top to the bottom with single Rials round about. Nay the poore <hi>Indians</hi> make it the chiefe master piece of their vanity to offer proudly in such occasions. <hi>Don Bernar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="103" facs="tcp:53246:57"/>
and having given faire warning for the omitting of it, but all without amendment, thought fit to fixe in writing upon the Churches dores an excommunication against all such as should presume at the time of service to eat or drinke within the Church. This excommunication was taken by all, but especially by the Gentlewomen much to heart, who protested if they might not eat or drinke in the Church, they could not continue in it to heare what otherwise they were bound unto. The chiefe of them knowing what great friendship there was between the Bishop and the Prior, and my selfe, came to the Prior and mee desiring us to use all meanes wee could with the Bishop for the revoking that his excommunication so heavily laid upon them, and threatning their soules with damning judgement for the violation of it. The good Prior and my selfe laboured all we could, alleadging the custome of the Countrey, the weakenesse of the sex whom it most concerned, and also the weaknesse of their stomackes, the contempt that might from them ensue unto his person, and many inconveniences which might follow to the breeding of an uproar in the church and in the City, whereof we had some probable conjecture from what already we had heard from some. But none of these reasons would move the Bishop; to which he answered that he preferred the honour of God, and of his house before his owne life. The women seeing him so hard to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated, began to stomacke him the more and to sleight him with scornefull and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proachfull words; others sleighted his excommunication, drinking in iniquity in the Church, as the fish doth water, which caused one day such an uproare in the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thedrall, that many swords were drawne against the Preists and Prebends, who at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to take away from the maids the cups of Chocolatte, which they brought unto their mistresses; who at last seeing that neither faire nor soule meanes would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile with the Bishop, resolved to forsake the Cathedrall, where the Bishops own and his Prebends eies must needs be watching over them; and so from that time most of the City betooke themselves to the Cloister Churches, where by the Nuns and Friers they were not troubled nor resisted, though fairely counselled to obey the command of the Bishop; whose name now they could not brooke, and to whose Prebends they denied now all such reliefe and stipend for Masses which formerly they had used to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow upon them, conferring them all upon the Fryers who grew rich by the poor im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poverished Cathedrall. This lasted not long, but the Bishop began to stomacke the Fryers, and to set up another excommunication, binding all the City to resort unto their owne Cathedrall Church; which the women would not obey, but kept their houses for a whole month; in which time the Bishop fell dangerously sick, and desired to retire himselfe to the Cloister of the Dominicans, for the great confidence he had in the Prior that he would take care of him in his sickenesse. Physitians were sent for far and neere, who all with a joynt opinion agreed that the Bishop was poisoned; and he himself doubted not of it at his death, praying unto God to forgive those that had been the cause of it, and to accept of that sacrifice of his life, which he was willing to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer for the zeale of Gods house and honour. He lay not above a week in the Cloister, and as soone as he was dead, all his body, his head and face did so swell, that the least touch upon any part of him caused the skin to break and cast out white matter, which had corrupted and overflowne all his body. A Gentlewoman with whom I was well acquainted in that City, who was noted to be somewhat too familiar with one of the Bishops Pages, was commonly censured to have prescribed such a cup of Chocolat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te to be ministred by the Page which poysoned him who so rigorously had forbidden Chocolatte to be drunk in the Church. My self heard this Gentlewoman say of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceased Bishop, that she thought few grieved for his death, &amp; that the women had no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to grieve for him, and that she judged, he being such an enemy to Chocolatte in the Church, that which he had drunk at home in his house had not agreed with his body. And it became afterwards a Proverbe in that Country, Beware of the Chocolatte of <hi>Chiapa;</hi> which made me so cautious, that I would not drinke afterwards of it in any house, where I had not very great satisfaction of the whole Family. The women of this City are somewhat light in their carriage, and have learned from the Devill many entising lessons and baits to draw poore soules to sinne and damnation; and if they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not have their wills, they wil surely work revenge either by Chocolatte or Conserves, or some faire present, which shall surely carry death along with it. The Gentlewoman that was suspected (nay was questioned for the death of the Bishop) had often used to send me boxes of Chocolatte or conserves; which I willingly received from her, judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:53246:58"/>
it to be a kind of gratuity for the paines I tooke in teaching her son <hi>Latin.</hi> She was of a very merry and pleasant disposition, which I thought might consist without sin; untill one day she sent unto mee a very faire plantin wrapped up in a hankerchief<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> buri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in sweet Jazmines and roses; when I untied the handkerchief, I thought among the flowers I should find some rich token, or some peeces of eight, but finding nothing but a plantin, I wondred; and looking further upon it, I found worked upon it with a knife the fashion of a heart with two of blind Cupids arrows sticking in it, discovering unto my heart the poisoned heart and thoughts of the poisoner that sent it. I thought it a good warning to be wary and cautious of receiving more presents or Chocolatte from such hands, and so returned unto her againe her plantin with this short rhyme cut out with a knife upon the skinne <hi>fruta tan fria, amor no cria,</hi> as much as to say, fruit so cold, takes no hold. This answer and resolution of mine was soone spread over that little City, which made my Gentlewoman outragious, which presently she shewed by taking away her sonne from schoole, and in many meetings threatning to play me a <hi>Chiapaneca</hi> tricke. But I remembred the Bishops Chocolatte and so was wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </p>
               <p>There is yet twelve leagues from this City of <hi>Chiapa,</hi> another <hi>Chiapa</hi> which deserveth better commendations. This consisteth most of <hi>Indians,</hi> and is held to be one of the biggest <hi>Indian</hi> Townes in all <hi>America,</hi> containing at least four thousand families. This Towne hath many priviledges from the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and is governed chiefly by <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians</hi> (yet with subordination unto the <hi>Spanish</hi> government of the City of <hi>Chiapa</hi>) who doe choose an <hi>Indian</hi> Governour with other inferiour officers to rule with him. This Governour may wear a rapier and dagger, and enjoyeth many other liberties which to the rest of the <hi>Indians</hi> are denied. No Towne hath so many <hi>Dons</hi> in it of <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian</hi> blood as this. <hi>Don Philip de Guzman</hi> was Governour of it in my time, a very rich <hi>Indian,</hi> who kept up commonly in his stable a dozen of as good Horses for publike shewes, and ostentation as the best <hi>Spaniard</hi> in the Countrey. His courage was not inferiour to any <hi>Spaniard,</hi> and for defence of some priviledges of his Town sued in the Chancery of <hi>Guatemala</hi> the proud and high minded Governour of the City of <hi>Chiapa,</hi> spending therein great sums of money till he had overcome him, whereupon he caused a feast to be made in the Towne, both by water and land, so stately, that truly in the Court of <hi>Madrid</hi> it might have been acted.</p>
               <p>This Towne lyeth upon a great river, whereunto belong many boats and Canoas, wherein those <hi>Indians</hi> have been taught to act sea-fights, with great dexterity, and to represent the Nymphes of <hi>Parnassus, Neptune, Aeolus,</hi> and the rest of the heathenish Gods and Goddesses, so that they are a wonder of their whole nation. They will arme with their boats a siege against the Town, fighting against it with such courage til they make it yeeld, as if they had been trained up all their life to sea-fights. So likewise within the Town they are as dexterous at baiting of buls, at <hi>juego de Cannas,</hi> at Horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>races, at arming a Campe, at all manner of <hi>Spanish</hi> dances, instruments, and mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick as the best <hi>Spaniards.</hi> They will erect Towers and Castles made of wood and pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted cloth, &amp; from them fight either with the boats or one against another, with squibs, darts, and many strange fire-works, so manfully, that if in earnest they could per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form it as well as they do it in sport and pastime, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> and Fryers might soon repent to have taught them what they have. As for acting of playes, this is a common part of their solemne pastimes; and they are so generous, that they nothing think too much to spend<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in banquets &amp; sweet-meats upon their Friers, and neighbouring Towns, whensoever they are minded to shew themselves in a publike feast. The Towne is very rich, &amp; many <hi>Indians</hi> in it that trade about the Country as the <hi>Spaniards</hi> do. They have learned most trades befitting a Common-wealth, and practise and teach them within their Town. They want not any provision of fish or flesh, having for the one that great river joyning unto their Towne, and for the other many Estantia's (as they call them) or farmes abounding with cattell. In this Towne the Dominican Fryers bear all the sway, who have a rich and stately Cloister with another Church or Chappel subordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate unto it. The heat here is so great, that both Fryers and <hi>Indians</hi> commonly wear a linnen towel about their necks to wipe off the constant swet from their faces, which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the Friers sit longer at their dinner then els the would do, for that at every bit they
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:53246:58"/>
eate, and draught they drinke, they are faine to make a stop to wipe their dropping browes. Yet the evenings are fresh and cool, which are much made of there, and spent in the many walkes and gardins which joyne close unto the River side. Two or three leagues from the Towne, there are two <hi>Ingenio's</hi> or Farmes of Sugar, the one belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Cloister of the Dominicans of the City of <hi>Chiapa;</hi> the other unto the Cloi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster of this Towne, which containe neer two hundred Blackmores, besides many <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians,</hi> who are imployed in that constant worke of making Sugar for all the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. Hereabouts are bread great store of Mules, and excellent horses for any service. The Towne of <hi>Chiapa</hi> of the <hi>Indians,</hi> and all the Townes about it want nothing but a more temperate climate and cooler aire, and Wheat, which there cannot bee sowne, yet for <hi>Spaniards</hi> and such as cannot live without it, it is brought from <hi>Chiapa</hi> of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> and from about <hi>Comitlan;</hi> yet this is not generally acknowledged a want by reason of the great plenty of <hi>Maiz</hi> which all the Townes enjoy, and which is now more used both by <hi>Spaniards</hi> and dainty toothed Fryers then bread of Wheat. Yet your poore <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and some <hi>Indians</hi> who have got the trick of trading from them doe gaine not a little in bringing to these Townes bisquets of wheaten bread, which though it be dry and hard, yet because they are novelties to the <hi>Indians;</hi> they get by changing them for other commodities, especially of Cotton wooll, which here is more abounding then in the Valley of <hi>Copanabastlau.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Upon this Country of <hi>Chiapa</hi> of the <hi>Indians</hi> bordereth the Province of <hi>Zoques,</hi> which is absolutely the richest part of <hi>Chiapa.</hi> This reacheth on the one side to <hi>Tabasco,</hi> and by the River named <hi>Grijalva</hi> sendeth commonly the Commodities which are in it with safety unto St. <hi>Iohn de Ulhua,</hi> or <hi>Vera Cruz.</hi> It trafiqueth also with the Country of <hi>Iucatan</hi> by the Haven called <hi>Puerto Real,</hi> which lyeth betweene <hi>Grijalva</hi> and <hi>Iuca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan.</hi> Yet these two, the River of <hi>Tabasco, alias Grijalva,</hi> and <hi>Puerto Real,</hi> though they bee commodious to this Province of <hi>Zoques,</hi> yet they are causes of daily feares unto the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who well know the weaknesse of them, and that if a forraine Nation should manfully thrust into that Country by any of these two wayes, they might so conquer all <hi>Chiapa,</hi> and from thence passe easily unto <hi>Guatemala.</hi> But the River of <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>basco</hi> lying low, and being somewhat hot, and the Towns about it infested with many gnats, and the chiefest commodity there being but <hi>Cacao,</hi> have often discouraged both our <hi>English</hi> and <hi>Hollanders,</hi> who have come up some part of the River, and minding more the foresaid reasons, then what was forward to bee had, have turned back, losing a rich Country and slighting an eternall name, for few and frivolous present difficulties. In this Province of <hi>Zoques,</hi> the Towns are not very bigge, yet they bee very rich; the chief Commodities are Silk and <hi>Cochinill;</hi> whereof the latter is held the best of <hi>America,</hi> and the store of it so great that no one Province alone exceeds it. Few <hi>Indians</hi> there are who have not their Orchards planted with the trees whereon the worms breed which yeeld unto us that rich Commodity; not that the <hi>Indians</hi> themselves esteem otherwise of it, then as they see the <hi>Spaniands</hi> greedy after it, offering them mony for it, &amp; forcing them to the preservation of it in those parts, which have proved most successeful for this kind. There is great store of silk in this Country, in so much that the <hi>Indians</hi> make it their great Commodity to imploy their wives in working Towels with all colours of silk, which the <hi>Spaniards</hi> buy, and send into <hi>Spain.</hi> It is rare to see what works those <hi>Indian</hi> women will make in silk, such as might serve for Patterns and samplers to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny School-Mistresses in <hi>England.</hi> The people of this Country are witty, and ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and faire of complexion; the Country towards <hi>Tabasco</hi> is hot, but within in some places very cold. There is also plenty of <hi>Maiz,</hi> but no wheat; neither is there such plenty of Cattell as about <hi>Chiapa,</hi> but Fowles and Turkies as many as in other parts. The Province called <hi>Zeldales</hi> lyeth behind this of the <hi>Zoques,</hi> from the North Sea within the continent, running up towards <hi>Chiapa,</hi> and reacheth in some parts neer to the borders of <hi>Comitlan</hi> north-westward. South-eastward it joyns to such <hi>Indians</hi> which as yet have not been conquered by the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who make many invasions upon the Christian <hi>Indians,</hi> and burn their Towns, and carry away their Cattell. The chief and head Town in this Province is called <hi>Ococingo,</hi> which is a Frontier against those Heathens. This Province is esteemed rich for the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who make much of <hi>Cacao,</hi> which serveth to make their drink of <hi>Chocolatte,</hi> and here is great store of it. There is also another Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity, great among the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> called <hi>Achiotte,</hi> wherewith they make their <hi>Choco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lattee</hi> looke of the colour of a brick. Here is also plenty of Hogs and Bacon, Fowles,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:53246:59"/>
Turkies, Quailes, Cattell, Sheep, Maiz, Hony, and not farre from <hi>Ococingo,</hi> in my time was setting up an <hi>Ingenio,</hi> or Farm of Sugar, which was thought would prove as well as those about <hi>Chiapa</hi> of the <hi>Indians.</hi> The Country in most parts is high and hilly; but <hi>Ococingo</hi> stands in a pleasant Valley, injoying many Brookes and streams of fresh wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and therefore hath been thought a fit place for Sugar. Here also in this Valley the Fryers have attempted to sow Wheat, which hath proved very good. Thus Reader, I have shewed you the Country of <hi>Chiapa,</hi> which as it is compassed about on the one side by <hi>Soconuzco,</hi> and from thence almost to <hi>Guatemala,</hi> by the Province of <hi>Suchutepeques,</hi> on the other side by <hi>Tabasco,</hi> and on the other side by <hi>Zeldales</hi> with excessive plenty of <hi>Cacao</hi> and <hi>Achiotte,</hi> which are the chief drugs for the making of <hi>Chocolatte;</hi> I wil yet before I depart from <hi>Chiapa</hi> to <hi>Guatemala,</hi> say somewhat of that drinke so much used by the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and in my judgment not to be sleighted, but rather to bee published and made known to all Nations, whose use might remedy the great abuse of wines and strong drinks which too much are esteemed amongst us here in <hi>Europe.</hi>

                  <hi>CHAP. XVI.</hi> Concerning two daily and common Drinkes, or Potions much used in the <hi>India's,</hi> called Chocolatte, and Atolle.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Hocolatte being this day used not onely over all the <hi>West-India's,</hi> but also in <hi>Spain, Italy,</hi> and <hi>Flanders,</hi> with approbation of many learned Doctors in Physick, among whom <hi>Antonio Colmenero</hi> of <hi>Ledesma;</hi> (who lived once in the <hi>India's</hi>) hath composed a learned and curious Treatise concerning the nature and quality of this drink; I thought fit to insert here also somewhat of it concerning my own experience for the space of twelve yeers. This name Chocolatte is an <hi>Indian</hi> name, and is compounded from Atte, as some say or as others, Atle, which in the <hi>Mexican</hi> lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage signifieth water, &amp; from the sound which the water (wherein is put the Chocolat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te) makes, as Choco, Choco, Choco, when it is stirred in a cup by an instrument called a Molinet, or Molinillo, untill it bubble and rise unto a froath. And as there it is a name compounded, so in <hi>English</hi> wee may well call it a compounded or a confectioned drink wherein are found many and severall Ingredients, according to the different disposition of the body of them that use it. But the chief Ingredient (without which it cannot be made) is called Cacao, a kind of nut or kernell bigger then a great Almond, which growes upon a tree called the tree of Cacao, and ripens in a great huske, wherein sometimes are found more, sometimes lesse Cacao's, sometimes twenty, sometimes thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, nay forty, and above. This Cacao, though as every simple, it containes the quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the foure Elements, yet in the common opinion of most Physitians, it is held to bee cold and dry, <hi>a praedominio;</hi> It is also in the substance that rules these two qualities, restringent and obstructive, of the nature of the Element of the earth. And as it is thus a mixed, and not a simple Element, it hath parts correspondent to the rest of the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; and particularly it partakes of those which correspond with the Element of Aire, that is, heat and moisture, wich are governed by unctious parts; there being drawn out of the Cacao much Butter, which in the <hi>India's</hi> I have seen drawn out of it by the Criolian women for to oint their faces. And let not this seeme impossible to believe, that this graine or nut of Cacao should bee said to bee first cold and dry, and then hot and moist; for though experience bee a thousand witnesses, yet instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces will further clear this truth; and first in the Rubarbe, which hath in it hot and soluble parts, and parts which are binding, cold and dry, which have a virtue to strengthen, bind and stop the loosenesse of the belly. Secondly, wee see this cleerly in the steel, which having so much of the nature of the earth, as being heavy, thick, cold, and dry, should be thought unproper for the curing of Oppilations, but rather to bee apt to increase them; and yet it is given for a proper remedy against them. The au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of <hi>Gal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>n</hi> may further cleare this in the third booke of the Qualities of sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, where hee teacheth that almost all those medicines, which to our sense seeme
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:53246:59"/>
to be simple, are notwithstanding naturally compounded, containing in themselves contrary qualities, that is to say, a quality to expell, and to retaine, to incrassate and to extenuate, to rarifie and to condense. And in the fifteenth Chapter following in the same booke, he puts an example of the broth of a Cock, which moves the belly, and the flesh hath the virtue to binde. Yet further that this differing virtue and quality is found in divers substances, or parts of simple medicaments, he shewes in the first book of his simple medicines in the seventeenth Chapter, bringing the example of milke, in which three substances are found and separated, that is to say, the substance of cheese, which hath the virtue to stop the fluxe of the belly; and the substance of whay, which is purging, and butter, as it is expressed Chap. 15. Also we find in wine which is in the Must, three substances, that is to say, earth, which is the chiefe; and a thinner sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, which is the flower, and may be called the scum, or froath; and a third sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance which we properly call wine; and every one of these substances containes in it selfe divers qualities and virtues, in the colour, in the smell, and in other accidents.</p>
               <p>And this is very comformable to reason, if we consider that every aliment, be it never sosimple, begets and produceth in the liver four humours, not only differing in tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, but also in substance; and begets more or lesse of that humour, according as the aliment hath more or fewer parts corresponding to the substance of that humour, which is most ingendred. From which examples we may gather that when the Cacao is grinded and stirred, the divers parts, which nature hath given it, doe artificially and intimately mixe themselves one with another; and so the unctuous, warme, and moist parts, mingled with the earthy represseth, and leaveth them not so binding, as they were before; but rather with a mediocrity, more inclining to the warme, and moist tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of the aire, then to the cold and dry of the earth; as it doth appear, when it is made fit to drink, that scarce two turnes are given with the Molinet, when there ariseth a fatty scum, by which is seen, how much it partaketh of the oyly part. So that from all that hath been said, the error of those is wel discovered, who speaking of this drink of Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colatte, say, that it causeth oppilations, because Cacao is astringent; as if that astriction were not corrected and modified by the intimate mixing of one part with another, by meanes of the grinding, as is said before. Besides it having so many ingredients, which are naturally hot, it must of necessity have this effect, that is to say, to open, attenuate, and not to binde. And leaving aside more reasons, this truth is evidently seen in the Cacao it selfe; which if it be not stirred, grinded and compounded to make the Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colatte; but be eaten as it is in the fruit (as many Criolian and <hi>Indian</hi> women eat it) it doth notably obstruct and cause stoppings, and make them looke of a broken, pale and earthy colour, as doe those that eat ear then ware, as pots, or pieces of lime-walls) which is much used among the <hi>Spanish</hi> women thinking that pale and earthy colour, though with obstructions and stoppings, well becomes them) and for this certainly in the Cacao thus eaten there is no other reason, but that the divers substances which it containes, are not perfectly mingled by the mastication onely, but require the artificiall mixture, which wee have spoken of before.</p>
               <p>The tree which doth beare this fruit, is so delicate, and the earth where it groweth so extream hot, that to keep the tree from being consumed by the sunne, they first plant other trees, which they call, <hi>las Madres del Cacao,</hi> mothers of the Cacao; and when these are grown up to a good height fit to shade the Cacao trees, then they plant the Cacaotals, or the trees of Cacao; that when they first shew themselves above the ground, those trees, which are already grown may shelter them, and as mothers nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish, defend, and shadow them from the sunne; and the fruit doth not grow naked, but many of them (as I have said before) are in one great huske or cod, and therein besides every grain is closed up in a white juicy skin, which the women also love to suck off from the Cacao, finding it coole, and in the mouth dissolving into water. There are two sorts of Cacao; the one is common, which is of a darke colour inclining to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards red, being round and peeked at the ends; the other is broader, and bigger, and flatter, and not so round, which they call, Patlaxte, and this is white, and more drying, and is sold a great deal cheaper then the former. And this especially, more then the other, causeth watchfullnesse, and drives away sleep, and therefore is not so usefull as the ordinary, and is chiefly spent by the ordinary and meaner sort of people. As for the rest of the ingredients which make this Chocolatticall confection, there is notable variety; for some put into it black Pepper, which is not well approved of by the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitians,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:53246:60"/>
because it is so hot and dry, but onely for one who hath a very cold liver; but commonly instead of this Pepper, they put into it long red Pepper, called Chile, which though it be hot in the mouth, yet is cool and moist in the operation. It is further compounded with white Sugar, Cinnamon, Clove, Anniseed, Almonds, Hasell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuts, <hi>Orejuela, Bainilla, Sap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>yoll,</hi> Orenge flower water, some Muske, and as much of Achiotte, as will make it looke of the colour of a red bricke. But how much of each of these may be applyed to such a quantity of Cacao, the severall dispositions of mens bodies must be their rule. The ordinary receipt of <hi>Antonio Colmenero</hi> was this; To e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very hundred Cacao's, two cods of Chile, called long red Pepper, one handfull of Anniseed and <hi>Orejuela's,</hi> and two of the flowers called <hi>Mechasucbil,</hi> or <hi>Bainilla,</hi> or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of this six roses of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> beat to powder, two drams of Cinnamon, of Almonds and Hasel-nuts, of each one dozen; of white Sugar halfe a pound, of Achi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>otte, enough to give it the colour. This Author thought neither Clove, nor Musk, nor any sweet water fit, but in the <hi>India's</hi> they are much used. Others use to put in Maiz, or <hi>Paniso,</hi> which is very windy; but such doe it onely for their profit, by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creasing the quantity of the Chocolatte; because every fanega or measure of Maiz con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining about a bushel and a half, is sold for eight shillings, and they that sell Chocolat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te, sell it for four shillings a pound, which is the ordinary price. The Cinnamon is held one of the best ingredients, and denied by none, for that it is hot and dry in the third degree, it provokes urine, and helpes the kidneys and reines of those who are troubled with cold diseases, and it is good for the eyes, and in effect it is cordiall, as appeareth by the Author of these verses,</p>
               <lg>
                  <l>Commoda &amp; urine Cinamomum &amp; renibus affert,</l>
                  <l>Lumina clarificat, dira venena fugat.</l>
               </lg>
               <p>The <hi>Achiotte</hi> hath a piercing, attenuating quality, as appeareth by the common practice of the Physicians in the <hi>India's,</hi> experienced daily in the effects of it, who do give it to their Patients to cut and attenuate the grosse humors, which doe cause shortnesse of breath, and stopping of urine: and so it is used for any kind of oppilations, and is given for the stoppings which are in the breast, or in the region of the belly, or any other part of the body. This <hi>Achiotte</hi> also groweth upon a tree in round huskes, which are full of red graines<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> from whence the <hi>Achiotte</hi> is taken, and first made into a paste, and then being dried up is fashioned either into round balls or cakes, or into the forme of little brickes, and so is sold. As concerning the long red Pepper, there are foure sorts of it; one is called <hi>Chilchotes;</hi> the other is very little, which they call <hi>Chilterpin,</hi> and these two kinds are very quick and biting. The other two are called, <hi>Tonalchiles,</hi> and these are but moderately hot, for they are eaten with bread by the <hi>Indians,</hi> as they eat o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fruits. But that which is usually put into Chocolatte, is called <hi>Chilpaclagua,</hi> which hath a broad huske, and is not so biting as the first, nor so gentle as the last. The <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chasuchil,</hi> or <hi>Bainilla</hi> hath a purgative quality. All these ingredients are usually put into the Chocolatte, and by some more, according to their fancies. But the meaner sort of people, as <hi>Blackmores</hi> and <hi>Indians,</hi> commonly put nothing into it, but <hi>Cacao, Achiotte, Maiz,</hi> and a few <hi>Chiles</hi> with a little Anniseed. And though the <hi>Cacao</hi> is mingled with all these ingredients, which are hot; yet there is to be a greater quantity of <hi>Cacao,</hi> then of all the rest of the ingredients, which serve to temper the coldnesse of the <hi>Cacao;</hi> from whence it followeth that this Chocolatticall confection is not so cold as the <hi>Cacao,</hi> nor so hot as the rest of the ingredients, but there results from the action and reaction of these ingredients, a moderate temper, which may be good, both for the cold and hot stomacks, being taken moderately.</p>
               <p>Now for the making or compounding of this drinke, I shall set downe here the method. The Cacao, and the other ingredients must be beaten in a morter of stone, or (as the <hi>Indians</hi> use) ground upon a broad stone, which they call <hi>Metate,</hi> and is only made for that use. But first the ingredients are all to be dried, except the <hi>Achiotte,</hi> with care that they may be beaten to powder, keeping them still in stirring, that they be not burnt, or become black; for if they be overdried, they will be bitter, and lose their virtue. The Cinnamon and the long red pepper are to be first beaten, with the Anniseed, and then the Cacao, which must be beaten by little and little, till it be all pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred; and in the beating it must be turned round, that it may mixe the better. Every one of these ingredients must be beaten by it selfe, and then all be put into the vessell, where the Cacao is, which you must stirre together with a spoon, and then take out that
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:53246:60"/>
paste, and put it into the morter, under which there must be a little fire, after the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection is made: but if m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>re fire be put under then will only warme it, then the unctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous part will dry away. The <hi>Achiotte</hi> also must be put in in the beating, that it may the better take the colour. All the ingredients must be searsed, save onely the Cacao, and if from the Cacao the dry shell be taken, it will be the better. When it is well beaten, and incorporated (which will be known by the shortnesse of it) then with a spoon (so in the <hi>India's</hi> is used) is taken up some of the paste, which will be almost liquid, and made into tablets, or else without a spoon put into boxes, and when it is cold it will be hard. Those that make it into tablets, put a spoonefull of the paste upon a peece of paper (the <hi>Indians</hi> put it upon the leaf of a plantin tree)where, being put into the shade (for in the sunne it melts and dissolves) it growes hard; and then bowing the paper or leaf, the tablet falls off, by reason of the fatnesse of the paste. But if it be put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to any thing of earth, or wood, it stickes fast, and will not come off, but with scra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping or breaking. The manner of drinking it, is divers; the one (being the way most used in <hi>Mexico</hi>) is to take it how with Atolle, dissolving a tablet in hot water, and then stirring and beating it in the cup, where it is to be drunke, with a Molinet, and when it is well stirred to a scumme or froath, then to fill the cup with hot Atolle and so drinke it sup by sup. Another way is, that the Chocolatte, being dissolved with cold water and stirred with the Molinet, and the scumme taken off and put into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vessel; the remainder be set upon the fire, with as much sugar as will sweeten it, and when it is warme, then to powre it upon the scum which was taken off before, and so to drinke it. But the most ordinary way, is, to warme the water very hot, and then to powre out halfe the cup full that you mean to drinke; and to put into it a tablet or two, or as much as will thicken reasonably the water, and then grind it well with the Molinet, and when it is well ground and risen to a scum, to fill the cup with hot wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and so drinke it by sups (having sweetned it with Sugar) and to eat it with a little conserve, or maple bread, steeped into the Chocolatte. Besides these waies there is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother way (which is much used in the Island of <hi>Santo Domingo</hi>) which is, to put the Chocolatte into a pipkin, with a little water, and to let it boyle well till it be dissol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and then to put in sufficient water and sugar according to the quantity of the Chocolatte, and then to boyle it againe, untill there comes an oily scumme upon it, and then to drinke it. There is another way yet to drinke Chocolatte, which is cold, which the <hi>Indians</hi> use at feasts, to refresh themselves, and it is made after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. The Chocolatte (which is made with none or very few ingredients)being dissol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in cold water with the Molinet, they take off the scumme or crassy part, which ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth in great quantity, especially when the Cacao is older and more putrefied. The scumme they lay aside in a little dish by it selfe, and then put sugar into that part from whence was taken the scum, and then powre it from on high into the scumme, and so drinke it cold. And this drinke is so cold, that it agreeth not with all mens stomacks; for by experience it hath been found, that it doth hurt, by causing pains in the stomack, especially to women. The third way of taking it is the most used, and thus certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it doth no hurt, neither know I why it may not bee used as well in <hi>England</hi> as in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther parts both hot and cold; for where it is so much used, the most, if not all, as well in the <hi>India's,</hi> as in <hi>Spaine, Italy, Flanders</hi> (which is a cold Countrey) find that it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeth well with them. True it is, it is used more in the <hi>India's,</hi> then in the <hi>Europe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> parts, because there the stomackes are more apt to faint then here, and a cup of Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colatte well confectioned comforts and strengthens the stomack. For my self I must say, I used it twelve yeers constantly, drinking one cup in the morning, another yet before dinner between nine or ten of the clock; another within an houre or two af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter dinner, and another between four and five in the afternoon; and when I was purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to sit up late to study, I would take another cup about seven or eight at night, which would keep me waking till about midnight. And if by chance I did neglect any of these accustomed houres, I presently found my stomacke fainty. And with this custome I lived twelve yeers in those parts healthy, without any obstructions, or oppilations, not knowing what either ague, or feaver was. Yet I will not dare to regulate by mine owne the bodies of others, nor take upon me the skil of a Physitian, to appoint and define at what time and by what persons this drinke may be used. Onely I say, I have known some that have been the worse for it, either for drinking it with too much sugar, which hath relaxed their stomackes, or for drinking it too often. For certainly if it
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:53246:61"/>
be drunke beyond measure, not only this Chocolatte but all other drinkes, or meats, though of themselves they are good and wholesome, they may be hurtfull. And if some have found it oppilative, it hath come by the too too much use of it; as when one drinkes over much wine, instead of comforting and warming himselfe, he breeds and nourisheth cold diseases, because nature cannot overcome it, nor turne so great a quantity into good nourishment. So he that drinkes much Chocolatte, which hath fatparts, cannot make distribution of so great a quantity to all the parts; and that part which remaines in the slender veines of the liver must needs cause oppilations and obstructions. But lastly, to conclude with this <hi>Indian</hi> drinke, I will adde what I have heard Physitians of the <hi>India's</hi> say of it, and have seen it by experience in others (though never I could find it in my selfe) that those that use this Chocolatte much, grow fat and corpulent by it: which indeed may seem hard to beleeve; for conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that all the ingredients, except the Cacao, doe rather extenuate, then make fat, because they are hot and dry in the third degree. And we have already said, that the qualities which doe predominate in Cacao, are cold and dry, which are very unfit to adde any substance to the body. Neverthelesse it may be answered that the many unctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous parts, which have been proved to be in the Cacao, are those which pinguifie and make fat; and the hotter ingredients of this composition serve for a guide, or vehi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, to passe to the liver, and the other parts, untill they come to the fleshy parts; and there finding a like substance which is hot and moist, as is the unctuous part, conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it selfe into the same substance, it doth augment and pinguifie. But how then might this Cacao with the other <hi>Indian</hi> ingredients be had in <hi>England?</hi> even by trading in <hi>Spaine</hi> for it, as we doe for other commodities; or not sleighting it so much as we and the <hi>Hollanders</hi> have often done upon the <hi>Indians</hi> seas; of whom I have heard the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi> say that when we have taken a good prize, a ship laden with Cacao, in anger and wrath we have hurled over board this good commoditie, not regarding the worth and goodnesse of it, but calling it in bad <hi>Spanish, Cagaruta de Carnero,</hi> or sheeps dung in good <hi>English.</hi> It is one of the necessariest commodities in the <hi>India's,</hi> and nothing enricheth <hi>Chiapa</hi> in particular more then it, whither are brought from <hi>Mexico</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther parts, the rich bags of Patacons onely for this <hi>Cagaruta de Carnero,</hi> which we call sheeps dung. The other drinke which is much used in the <hi>India's</hi> is called Atolle, of which I will say but a little, because I know it cannot be used here. This was the drinke of the ancient <hi>Indians,</hi> and is a thick pap made of the flower of Maiz, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king off the huskes from it, which is windy and melancholy. This is commonly car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried by the <hi>Indian</hi> women to the Markets hot in pots, and there is sold in cups. The Criolian students, as wee goe to a Taverne to drink a cup of wine, so they go in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany to the publike Markets, and as publikely buy and drinke by measure of this Atol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le; which somtimes is seasoned with a little Chile, or long Pepper, and then it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth them best. But the Nuns and Gentlewomen have got a trick of confectioning it with Cinnamon, Sweet-waters, Amber, or Muske, and store of Sugar, and thus it is held to be a most strong and nourishing drinke, which the Physitians doe prescribe unto a weake body, as we doe here our Almond-milke. But of what <hi>England</hi> never knew nor tasted, I will say no more, but hasten my penne to <hi>Guatemala,</hi> which hath been my second <hi>patria.</hi>

But among all, the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours wife was most liberall unto mee, sending mee many boxes of Aromaticall Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colatte, and one extraordinary great box with foure severall divisions of different con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves gilt over, besides many Maplebreads, and Biskets made with Egs and Sugar, a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent it was which might have been sent to a greater man then to a poor worthlesse Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicant Fryer, and with this in a handkerchief a dozen peeces of eight. <hi>Don Mel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>eopixca,</hi> six leagues from <hi>Chiapa,</hi> a faire and great Towne of <hi>Indians,</hi> who are held to bee next unto the <hi>Indians</hi> of the other <hi>Chiapa</hi> in sitting and riding a horse. In this town is nothing so considerable as the Church, which is great and strong, and the musick belonging unto it sweet and harmonious. The Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>car or Curate of this place was one Fryer <hi>Peter Martir</hi> a Criolian, whom I knew could not indure the Prior nor mee, yet he would dissemble a love complementall exceeding well, and in outward shews raise it up to <hi>gradus ut Octo.</hi> He knowing my prevalency with the Prior, durst not but give mee very good entertainment, which continued two dayes, untill I was weary of his complements.</p>
               <p>The third day I tooke my leave of him, who would not yet leave mee, but would conduct mee to <hi>Comitlan,</hi> whither I was invited by the Prior of that Cloister, named Fryer <hi>Thomas Rocolano,</hi> a <hi>French</hi> man, who being a stranger to the <hi>Spaniards</hi> (for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides him and my selfe there was no other stranger in that County) desired acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with mee, which hee began to settle by meeting mee at the half way with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>Indians</hi> on horse back, having provided an harbour where wee might more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniently conferre and rest while our Chocolatte and other refreshments were provided. But the Criolian <hi>Peter Martir</hi> was not a little envious, (as I was afterwards informed in the Cloister) to see mee so much made of and esteemed in the Country, yet his faire words a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>d complements farre exceeded the sincerity and down-rightnesse of my <hi>French</hi> friend. At <hi>Comitlan</hi> I staied a whole weeke, riding about with the Prior unto the <hi>Indian</hi> townes, and downe the hill to the valley of <hi>Copanabastla,</hi> where I injoyed much pastime and recreation among the Fryers and <hi>Indians</hi> and was feasted after the manner of that Country, which knoweth more of an Epicurian diet then doth <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi> or any part of <hi>Europe;</hi> nay I am perswaded (and I have heard <hi>Spaniards</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse it) that <hi>Spain</hi> hath taken from the <hi>India's</hi> since the conquest many lessons for the dressing of severall dishes and compleating a feast or banquet. After the week was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded my <hi>French</hi> friend the Prior conducted mee to <hi>Izquintenango,</hi> to see mee well furnish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up the Mountaines of <hi>Cuchumatlanes.</hi> This Towne (as I have formerly observed) standeth almost at the end of the Valley of <hi>Copanabastla,</hi> and within two leagues of the <hi>Cuchumatlanes.</hi> It is one of the finest <hi>Indian</hi> Townes of all the Province of <hi>Chiapa,</hi> and very rich, by reason of the much Cotton wooll in it, and especially by reason of its situation, for standing in the Roade way to <hi>Guatemala,</hi> all the Merchants of the Country that trade with their mules that way, passe through this Towne, and there buy and sell, enriching it with mony and farre brought Commodities. It is most plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully stored with fruits, especially with what they call Pina's or Pine fruit. It standeth close by the great River, which runneth to <hi>Chiapa</hi> of the <hi>Indians,</hi> and hath its spring not farre off from the <hi>Cuchamatlanes,</hi> and yet at this Town is very broad and deep. No man nor beast travlling to <hi>Guatemala</hi> can goe into it, or from <hi>Guatemala</hi> can goe out of it, but by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="112" facs="tcp:53246:62"/>
and by such as they call Requas of mules (every Requa consisting of fifty or threescore mules) this Ferry is day and night imployed) and yeelds much treasure to the town at the yeers end. The <hi>Indians</hi> of the Town besides the ferry boat, have made many other little boats, or Canoa's to goe up and down the River. Hither when the Prior of <hi>Comitlan</hi> had brought me, we were waited for by the Vicar or Fryer of that Town with the chief and principall <hi>Indians,</hi> and most of the Canoa's. As we ferryed over, the little Canoa's went before us with the Quiristers of the Church singing before us, and with others sounding their Waits and Trumpets. The Fryer that lived in this Town, was called Fryer <hi>Geronymo de Gueva<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>a,</hi> little in stature, but great in state, pride and vanity, as hee shewed himself in what hee had provided for us both of fish and flesh. A brave professour or vower of Mendicancy and poverty he was, who in twelve yeers that hee had lived in that Towne, what by mumming of Masses for the dead and living, what by shearing and fleecing the poore <hi>Indians,</hi> what by trading and traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiquing with the Merchants that used that Rode, had got six thousand Duckats, which hee had sent to <hi>Spain</hi> to the Court of <hi>Madrid,</hi> to trade with them Simoniacally for the Bishoprick of <hi>Chiapa,</hi> which if he obtained not, (yet when I came out of that Country the report went that hee had obtained it) hee would and was well able with a second supply to obtaine a better. After two daies feasting with him, hee and the Prior of <hi>Comitlan</hi> both joyned their power and authority to see mee well manned with <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians,</hi> to the first Towne of the <hi>Cuchumatlanes.</hi> A mule was prepared to carry my bedding, (which wee commonly carried with us in chests of leather called Petaca's) another <hi>Indian</hi> to carry my Petaquilla wherein was my Chocolatte and all imple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to make it; and three more <hi>Indians</hi> to ride before and behinde to guide me; but to all these nothing was to be paid, (lest a custome of paying should bee brought in, for so they doctrined mee as a novice in that Country) except it were to give them a cup of Chocolatte if I drank in the way, or when I came to my journeys end. Here I tooke my leave of my good <hi>French</hi> friend, (who yet continued friendship with mee by frequent letters to <hi>Guatemala</hi>) and of my low but high minded <hi>Guevara,</hi> who bad mee expect no friendly entertainment, untill I were well passed over the <hi>Cuchuma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlanes</hi> and arrived at <hi>Sacapula,</hi> which was foure daies journey from thence. Yet hee told mee I might demand what service I list from the <hi>Indians,</hi> and call for what I had a minde to eat without paying any mony, so that I did write down my expences in the common Town Book.</p>
               <p>Thus I went away from my friends somewhat heavy having no other company but unknowne <hi>Indians,</hi> leaving a pleasant and delightsome valley behind mee, and seeing nothing before mee but high and steepy hils and mountaines, and considering that in foure or five dayes I should see no more gallant Dominicans and of mine own profession. Now I wished I had the company of my <hi>Melendez</hi> and other friends, who were a comfort one to another upon the hills and rocks of <hi>Maquilapa<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> Yet at last I concluded, up <hi>English</hi> heart and courage, <hi>quondam haec meminisse juvabit.</hi> Though the mountaines seemed high afar off, yet as I travelled on, I found the way lie between them very easie and passable, and met now and then Requas of mules, which were no little comfort unto mee to consider, if they being heavily laden could goe through those Mountaines, my mule that had in mee but a light burden would easily over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come any danger; it comforted mee also to consider that there were Townes (though but little ones) where I might rest every night. The further I went, the better and more open I found the Rode; Onely the raine and dirt troubled me, which I could not avoid, it being the end of <hi>September,</hi> or as there they reckon, the end of winter. The first Town I came to amongst those Mountaines was called St. <hi>Martin,</hi> a little place of some twenty houses; I went to the house that belonged to the Franciscan Fryers (who seldome in the yeer came to that poverty of house and house roome) where I lighted and caused the <hi>Indians</hi> to bee called who were appointed to give attendance to tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers and passengers. I found them very tractable and dutifull, bidding mee wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, bringing mee hot water for my Chocolatte, which I drunke off heartily, and gave unto my <hi>Indians</hi> of <hi>Izquintenango,</hi> who refreshed themselves and their mules well for nothing, this being a custome among those Townes in the Rode to welcome one another whensoever they come with travellers. I might have had for my supper any thing that place would afford, but I made choice of a pullet, which I thought would bee cheapest for the poore <hi>Indians.</hi> I was glad I had brought with mee a good
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:53246:62"/>
big Frasco, as they call it, or bottle of wine, for I began already to find the <hi>Cuchumatlanes</hi> cooler then the valley of <hi>Copanabastla.</hi> My bed was made in a little thatched Cobe, and <hi>Indian</hi> boyes appointed to sleep in the next room to me, and to be at hand if in the night I should want any thing. Thus having appointed what attendance I had need of in the morning to the next Town, discharging the <hi>Indians</hi> that had brought me from <hi>Izquin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenango,</hi> I went unto my rest, which I tooke as quietly as if I had been in the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of my best friends. The next day being accompanied by two <hi>Indians,</hi> having sent my carriage by another, I tooke my journey to the next Towne, which is called <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chumatlan grande,</hi> because it standeth on the highest part of those Mountaines, and in the way the <hi>Indians</hi> shewed mee the head spring or fountaine of the great River of <hi>Chiapa</hi> of the <hi>Indians,</hi> which is the onely remarkable thing in that Rode. <hi>Cuchuma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlan grande</hi> is a Towne a little bigger then St. <hi>Martin,</hi> and of <hi>Indians</hi> very curteous, who are used and beaten to daily travellers, and so make very much of them. Here I was entertained as the night before; and found the poore <hi>Indians</hi> willing to give mee whatsoever I demanded for my better and safer guiding and conducting the next day, and that night for my supper what I pleased to call for, without any pay, but onely writing down my name and expences with the day and moneth in their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon booke of accounts. This are those poore wretches brought to by the Fryers and commanding Justices, though of themselves they have no more then a Milpa of Maiz as they terme it, or a little <hi>Indian</hi> Wheat Plantation, with as much Chile as will suffice them for the yeer, and what the Merchants and Travellers give them voluntarily, which is little enough. From this Town I would not follow the Rode to the next, which was a long journy of seven or eight leagues without baiting by the way; and also be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I had beene informed at <hi>Chiapa</hi> and at <hi>Copanabastla</hi> of a strange picture of our Lady, which was amongst these Mountaines in a little Towne of <hi>Indians</hi> called <hi>Chiantla,</hi> which in this dayes journy being not above a league out of my way, I was resolved to see. The wayes were bad, lying out of the Rode, yet by noon I got to <hi>Chiantla,</hi> which is a Town belonging unto Mercenarian Fryers, who doubtlesse would not be able to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist in so poore a place, had they not invented that loadstone of their picture of <hi>Mary,</hi> and cried it up for miraculous, to draw people farre and neere, and all travellers from the Rode to pray unto it, and to leave their gifts and almes unto them for their pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and Masses. Such an income of treasure and riches hath beene from deluded and ignorant soules to this beggerly Towne, that the Fryers have had wherewith to build a Cloister able to maintaine foure or five of them. The Church is richly fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished, but especially the high Altar where the picture standeth in a Tabernacle with half a dozen curtaines of Silk, Sattin, cloth of gold, with borders of golden lace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it, wearing a rich Crowne of gold, thickly beset with Diamonds and other pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious stones. There hang before it at least a dozen rich lampes of silver; and in the vestry of the Church are many gownes, Candlestickes of silver, Censers to burn Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kincense before it, besides rich Copes, Vestments, Ornaments for the Altar, and hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings for all the Church.</p>
               <p>To conclude, here is a treasure hid in the Mountaines; Oh that it could bee found out to doe the Lord service. I was welcomed to this place by those Fryers, who were strangers unto mee; my head was filled that day by them with relations of strange and many miracles or lies, which they told mee of that picture; but the heavinesse of my head did mee good in something, for it made mee more drowsie at night and apter to take good rest. The next day I got into the Rode againe, and went to the last Town of these <hi>Cuchumatlanes</hi> called <hi>Chautlan,</hi> where I stayed all that day and night, and sent before a letter to the Prior of <hi>Sacapula</hi> of my going thither the next day. In <hi>Chautlan</hi> I was very kindly used by the <hi>Indi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

The next morning I made haste to be gone, that I might come sooner to <hi>Sacapula,</hi> where I was to finde those of mine owne profession, with whom I knew I might stay and rest a whole weeke if I pleased. I had not rid above three leagues, when I began to discover at a low and deep bottome, a pleasant and goodly valley, laced with a River, whose
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:53246:63"/>
waters receiving the glorious brightnesse of <hi>P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>aebus</hi> beames reverberated up to the top of the Mountaine, a delightsome prospect to the beholders; the more I hasted to that seeming Paradise, the more did the twinkling and wanton streame invite mee downe the hill; which I had no sooner descended, but I found in an harbour by the water side the Prior of <hi>Sacapula</hi> himselfe with a good traine of <hi>Indians</hi> waiting for mee with a cup of Chocolatte. At the first sight I was a little daunted to behold the Prior, who looked most fearfully with a bladder from his throat swelled almost round his necke, which hung over his shoulders and breast, and stayed up his chin, and lifted up his head so, that hee could scarce looke any whither but up to heaven. In our discourse he told mee that disease had beene upon him at least ten yeers, and that the water of that River had caused it in him, and in many others of that Town. This made mee now as much out of love with the River, as above the hill I had liked the goodly sight of it, and therefore resolved not to stay so long in that place as I had thought, lest the waters should marke me for all my life, as they had done this Prior; whose name was Fryer <hi>Iohn De la Cruz,</hi> a Biscaine borne, and (like some of that Nation) a little trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with the simples, but a good hearted man, humble, and well beloved over all the Country both by <hi>Spaniards</hi> and <hi>Indians.</hi> When I came to the Towne I discovered many men and women with bladders in their throats like the poore Prior, which made mee almost unwilling to drink there any Chotolatte made with that water, or eat a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing dressed with it; untill the Prior did much incourage mee and told mee that it did not hurt all but onely some, and those who did drink it cold; wherewith I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved to stay there foure or five daies, because of the old Priors importunity, who would faine have had mee continue to live with him, promising to teach mee the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian</hi> language in a very short time. But higher matters calling mee to <hi>Guatemala,</hi> I excused my selfe, and continued there five dayes with much recreation. The Town though it be not in the generall very rich, yet there are some <hi>Indian</hi> Merchants who trade about the country and especially to <hi>Suchutepeques</hi> where is the chief store of Cacao, and thereby some of this Towne of <hi>Sacapula,</hi> have inriched themselves; the rest of the people trade in pots and pans, which they make of an earth there fit for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose. But the principall Merchandize of this place is salt, which they gather in the morning from the ground that lyeth neere the River. The aire is hot, by reason the Town standeth low, and compassed with high hills on every side. Besides many good fruits which are here, there are Dates as good as those in that come from <hi>Barbary,</hi> and many trees of them in the Garden belonging to the Cloister. After I had here wearied out the wearinesse, which I brought in my bones from the <hi>Cuchumatlanes,</hi> I departed taking my way to <hi>Guatemala,</hi> and from <hi>Sacapula</hi> I went to a Town called St. <hi>Andres,</hi> or St. <hi>Andrews,</hi> which standeth six or seven leagues from <hi>Sacapula,</hi> a great Town, but nothing remarkable in it, save onely Cotton wooll and Turkies, and about it some rich Estancia's or Farmes of Cattell, which are commodiously seated here, it being a plain Champaigne Country. Yet at further end of this plain there is a Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine which discourageth with the sight all such as travell to <hi>Guatemala;</hi> from St. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dres</hi> I prepared my selfe for the next daies journey, which was of nine long leagues, to a very great Town called by two names, by some <hi>Sacualpa,</hi> by others Sta. <hi>Maria Zojabah,</hi> to the which I could not go<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>s might meet mee upon the Mountaine; and the night before I went to a Rancho (which is a lodge built for travellers to rest when the journey is long) which stood within a league of the Mountaine by a River, where with the waters murmur, and refreshing gales I tooke good rest. In the morning having refreshed my selfe, and my <hi>Indians</hi> with Chocolatte I set out to incounter with that proud Mountaine; and when I came unto it I found it not so hard to overcome, as I had conceited, the way lying with windings and turnings; But the higher I mounted the more my eyes were trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with looking to the River below, whose rockes were enough to astonish and make a stout heart tremble. About the middle of the Mountaine the <hi>Indians</hi> of <hi>Zojabah</hi> met with a mule for mee, and another for my carriage in a narrow passage where the way went wheeling. Here I lighted, whilst the <hi>Indians</hi> helped one another to unload and load the mule that came of refresh. Out of the narrow way the side of the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine was steepy, and a fearefull precipice of two or three miles to the bottome, almost bare of trees, here and there one onely growing. My heart was true unto mee, wishing
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:53246:63"/>
mee to walke up a foot untill I came unto some broader passage; but the <hi>Indians</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving my feare told me there was no danger, assuring mee further that the Mule they had brought was sure, and had beeen well used to that mountaine. With their perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions I got up, but no sooner was I mounted when the Mule began to play her prankes and to kick, and to leap out of the way, casting me down and herselfe, both rouling and tumbling a pace to the ro ckes and death, had not a shrub prevented me, and a tree stopped the Mules blind fury. The <hi>Indians</hi> cried out, <hi>milagro, milagro,</hi> miracle, mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, <hi>Santo, Santo,</hi> a Saint, a Saint, to me so loud as if they would have had their cry reach to <hi>Rome</hi> to helpe forward my canonization; for many such miracles have some been noised at <hi>Rome,</hi> and with further contribution of mony have been enrolled in the booke and Catalogue of Saints. Whilst the <hi>Indians</hi> helped me up and brought the Mule againe into the way, they did nothing but flatter me with this terme Saint; which they needed not have done, if as they considered my dangerous fall and stopping at a shrub (which was by chance, and not by miracle) they had further considered my passion and hasty wrath (not befitting a Saint) wherewith I threatned to bast their ribs for deceiving mee with a yong Mule not well accustomed to the saddle. But all my hasty words and anger could not discredit me with them, nor lessen their conceipt of my holinesse and sanctity, who hold the anger and wrath of a Preist to be the breath of Gods nostrils, and with this their foolish conceipt of mee, they knecled before me kissing my hands. The businesse being further examined, they confessed that they had been mistaken in the Mules, having sadled for me that which should have carried my Petaca's, or leatherne chests, which was a young Mule accustomed onely to carriages, and not to the sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, and upon that which should have been sadled they put my carriage. Whilst they unloaded and loaded again and sadled the right Mule, I walked up the hill about a mile, and when they overtooke me I got up and rid till I met with my refreshing harbour and Chocolatte, and many <hi>Indians</hi> that came to receive me, among whom it was present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly noised that I was a Saint and had wrought a miracle in the way; with this the rest of the <hi>Indians</hi> kneeled to me and kissed my hands, and in the way that we went to the Towne, all their talk was of my sanctity. I was much vexed at their simplicity, but the more they saw mee unwilling to accept of that honour, the more they pressed it upon me. When I came to the Town I told the Frier what had happened, and what the foolish <hi>Indians</hi> had conceited; at which he laughed, and told me that he would warrant me if I staied long in the Towne, all the men and women would come to kisse my hands and to offer their gifts unto me. He knew well their qualities, or else had taught them this superstition with many others; for no sooner had we dined, but many were gathered to the Church to see the Saint that was come to their Towne, and that had wrought a miracle in the mountaine as he came. With this I began to be more troubled then before at the folly of the simple people, and desired the Fryer to checke and rebuke them, who by no means would, but rather laughed at it, saying, that in po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy we ought to accept of any honour from the <hi>Indians,</hi> for as long as we had credit and an opinion of Saints among them, so long we should prevaile to do any with them, yea even to command them and their fortunes at our pleasure. With this I went downe with the Frier to the Church, and sate downe with him in a chaire in the Quire, repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting the person of such a Saint as they imagined me to be, though in reality and truth but a wretched sinner.</p>
               <p>No sooner had we taken up our places, when the <hi>Indians,</hi> men, women, and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren came up by three and four, or whole families to the Quire, first kneeling down for my blessing, and then kissing my hands, they began to speake to me in their <hi>Indian</hi> complements to this purpose, that their Town was happy and doubtlesse blessed from heaven by my coming into it, and that they hoped their soules should be much the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tter if they might partake of my praiers to God for them. And for this purpose some offered unto me money, some hony, some <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>gs, some little mantles, some Plantins, and other fruits, some fowles, and some Turkeys. The Frier that sate by me I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived was overjoyed with this, for he knew I was to be gone, and would leave unto him all those offerings. I desired him to make answer unto the <hi>Indians</hi> in my behalfe, excusing me as not well versed in their language (yet the fooles if they thought and judged me to be a Saint, might have expected from me also the gift of tongues) which he did telling them that I hadbeen but a while in that Country, and though I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood part of their language, yet could not speake nor pronounce it perfectly, and
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:53246:64"/>
therefore from me he did give them hearty thankes for the great love they had shewed unto an Ambassadour of God, witnessing it with so many sorts of offerings, which assuredly should remind him and mee of our offerings for them, in our praiers and hearty recommendations of them and their children unto God. Thus was that cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony ended, the <hi>Indians</hi> dismissed, and the Frier and I went up to a chamber, where he began to tell his egs and fowles and to dispose of some of them for our supper; he told me he would take them, but at my departure would give me somewhat for them; he bad me keep what money they had given me, and told me I was welcome unto him, and no burdensome guesse, but very profitable, who had brought with me store of provision for my selfe and for him many daies after. The money I received cane to fourty Rials, besides twenty which he gave me for the other offerings, which might be worth four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty more; all this I got for having a fall from a Mule, and for not breaking my necke. I would faine have departed the next morning, but <hi>Iohn Vidall</hi> (so was the Frier na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med) would not permit me, for that the next journey was of at least 20 leagues, and therefore he would have me rest my selfe the next day.</p>
               <p>This Towne of <hi>Zojabah,</hi> or <hi>Sacualpa</hi> is the biggest and fairest of all the Towns that belong unto the Priory of <hi>Sacapula;</hi> the <hi>Indians</hi> are rich, and make of their Cotton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wool many mantles, they have plenty of hony, and great flocks of goats and kids; but here, nor in all the Townes behind there is no wheat, save only <hi>Indian</hi> Maiz. The next day some small offerings fell unto mee, but nothing like the day before; and so I told the Frier, that now the peoples devotion was decaied, I would bee gone in the morning before day. That night the chiefe <hi>Indians</hi> of the Towne came to offer their service and attendance upon me to a Rancho or lodge that standeth in the middle way; but I would not accept of the great ones, but desired that I might have three onely of the meaner sort to guide mee till I met with company from the Towne whither I was going, and whither I had sent warning of my comming. The time appointed was three of the clock in the morning; at which houre after a little sleep I was called, and having drunke my Chocolatte, and eat a maple bread with a little conserve, I prepared my selfe for my journey, and found the <hi>Indians</hi> ready waiting for me in the yard, with pieces of pine-wood, which burn like torches, and with which they use to travell in the night, and to shew the way to him whom they guide. A little from the Towne wee had some craggy wayes, which indeed had need of lights, but afterwards we came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a plaine champaigne Countrey, which continued till within a league of the middle way lodge; to the which we were to descend a steep hill. When we came thither (which was about seven in the morning) we found our fresh supply waiting for us, who had set out from their Towne at midnight to meet us (note the <hi>Indians</hi> subjection to their Preists command) and had made us a fire, and warmed water for our Chocolatte. Which whilst I was drinking, the <hi>Indians</hi> of <hi>Zojabah,</hi> who had guided me thither, gave notice to those that came to receive from <hi>St. Martin</hi> (so was the Towne called whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I was that day minded) of my miracle and sanctity, wishing them to reverence and respect me in the way. But not for this their foolish report did I make the <hi>Indians</hi> of <hi>Zoiabah</hi> drinke every one a cup of Chocolatte, and so dismissed them; and took for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards my journey to <hi>St. Martin.</hi> Most of the way was hilly and craggy till we came within two miles of the Towne; to the which we arrived by noone. This Towne is cold, standing high, yet pleasant for the prospect almost to <hi>Guatemala;</hi> here, and in most of the Towns about it is most excellent wheat. The hony of this Towne is the best in the Countrey; but above all it furnisheth <hi>Guatemala</hi> with Quailes, Partridges, and Rabbits. It is the first Towne wee enter into belonging to the City and command of <hi>Guatemala;</hi> which did not a little comfort me, that now I wanted but one good journey to make an end of my long, tedious and wea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

The Frier of this Towne named <hi>Thomas de la Cruz</hi> belonged unto the Dominican Cloister of <hi>Guatemala;</hi> he was a Criolian, but yet he entertained me very lovingly. I staied with him but that night. And in the morning (though I might have gone to dinner to <hi>Gua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temala</hi>) I would needs goe by the way to one of the biggest Townes in that Countrey, called <hi>Chimaltenango,</hi> standing in an open valley three leagues from the City, consisting of a thousand house-keepers, and rich <hi>Indians</hi> who trade much about the Countrey. In this Towne in my time there was one <hi>Indian,</hi> who alone had bestowed upon the Church five thousand duckates. The Church yeelds to none in the City of <hi>Guatemala,</hi> and in musick it exceeds <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

upon the 26. day of <hi>Iuly,</hi> (which they call St. <hi>Annes</hi> day) and then is the richest faire that ever my eyes beheld in those parts of all sorts of Merchants and Merchandize; It is further set forth with Bull-baiting, Horce-racing, Stage-playes, Maskes, dances, Musick, and all this gallantly performed by the <hi>Indians</hi> of the Town. The Fryer of this Town was a Dominican, belonging to the Cloister of the Dominicans of <hi>Guate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mala,</hi> named <hi>Alonso Hidalgo,</hi> a foure eyed old man, for hee alwaies wore spectacles. Hee was a <hi>Spaniard</hi> borne, but having beene brought up in that Country from his youth, and having taken his habit and vowes in <hi>Guatemala</hi> amongst the Criolians, hee degenerated from his birth and Country-men, hating all such as came from <hi>Spain.</hi> Hee was deadly enemy to the Provinciall (ayming indeed himselfe to bee Provinciall with the favour of the Criolians) and so I perceived hee would have picked a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell with mee) whilst I was with him; hee told mee I was welcome, though hee had little reason to bid any welcome that had come from <hi>Spain,</hi> who hee thought came but to supplant those that had been born and brought up there in their own Country, and that for ought hee knew, I learning the language of those <hi>Indians</hi> might one day dispossesse him of that Towne, wherein hee had continued above ten yeers; hee envied much against the Provinciall and Fryer <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> the Prior of <hi>Guatemala,</hi> whom hee knew to b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

But all this I put up with a jest, saying, that I would bee sure to take notice first of the riches of his chamber in pictu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Hee perceived I jeared him, and so hee let mee alone; I was glad I had put him out of his former byas of rayling; so dinner being ended, I told him I would not stay supper, but goe to <hi>Guatemala</hi> to a light supper in the Cloister, for that hee had given mee such a dinner, as I feared I should not have digested it in few daies. I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired him to let me have <hi>Indians</hi> to guide me to <hi>Guatemala,</hi> which he willingly performed, peradventure fearing that if I stayed supper with him, I should melt the teeth in his mouth with some scalding cup of my Chocolatte brought from <hi>Chiapa,</hi> or that in the night I should rifle or plunder his chamber of his rich Idols and Ebony Cabinets. The <hi>Indians</hi> being come, I made hast to be gone from that four eyed beast, being now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirous of a constant rest in <hi>Guatemala.</hi> Within a league from this Town of <hi>Chimaltenango,</hi> the Rode way leaving that open, wide, and spatious valley, contracts and gathereth in it selfe between hils and mountaines standing on each side, and so continueth to the City.

This Town is called <hi>Xocotenango,</hi> of a fruit named Xocotte, which is most plentifull there, and all about the Country; it is fresh and cooling, of a yellow colour when ripe, and of two sorts, some sweet, and others sowre, of the stones whereof the <hi>Indians</hi> make a

fire; they lie so thick in the way, dropping from the trees for want of gathering and spending them all, that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> have begun to practise the buying of Hogs on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose to let them runne about that high way, finding that they fat as speedily and as well with those plummes, as our Hogs doe in <hi>England</hi> with Akorns. All this way are also many faire gardens, which supply the Markets of <hi>Guatemala</hi> with herbs, roots, fruits, and flowers all the yeer. There are further in this Rode three water mills for the corn of the City, whereof the chief and the richest belongs to the Dominican Fryers of <hi>Guatemala,</hi> who keep there a Fryer constantly with three or foure Blackmores to doe and oversee the worke; What will not those Fryers doe to satisfie their covetous mindes? Even dusty Millars they will become to get wealth. The Frontispice of the Church of this Town is judged one of the best pieces of worke thereabouts; the high Altar within is also rich and stately, being all daubed with gold. I made no stay in this place, because I knew I should have many occasions after my setling in the City to come unto it. And thus keeping between the hils I continued on my journey till I came to <hi>Guatemala,</hi> whose Dominions, riches and greatnesse the following chapter shall largely shew.</p>

                     </gap>oader street having houses on each side, which seemed to promise a City at hand. At my first turning I discovered a proud and stately Cloister, which was the place of rest to my wearied body. I surrounded it to finde out the back gate, and there lighted, and enquired for the Prior, who bad me very welcome, assuring me that for the Provincials sake, I should want no incouragement, and that hee would doe for mee much more then what the Provinciall had signified unto him by Letters. He told mee hee had beene brought up in <hi>Spain,</hi> in the Country of <hi>Asturias,</hi> where many <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish</hi> ships did use to come, and having seen there many of my Nation, he affected them very much, and to mee as one of so good a Nation, and as a stranger and Pilgrime out of my owne Country, hee would shew all the favour that the utmost of his power would afford. How glad was I, to find in him so contrary an opinion to that of foure eyed <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalgo?</hi> And how did he performe his words? He was the chief Master and Reader of Divinity in the University, his name Master <hi>Iacinthode Cabannas,</hi> who finding mee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirous to follow the Schools, and especially to hear from him some lessons of Theologie, within the first quarter of yeer, that I had been his constant and attentive Auditor, graced mee with a publick act of conclusions of Divinity, which I was to defend under his direction and moderation in the face of the whole University and Assembly of Doctors and Divines, against the Tenents of <hi>Scotus</hi> and <hi>Suarez.</hi> But the principall and head conclusion was concerning the birth of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> whom both Jesuites, <hi>Suarez</hi> and Franciscans, and Scotists hold to have beene borne without Originall sinne, or
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:53246:65"/>
any guilt or staine of it, against whose fond, foolish and ungrounded fancies, I publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly defended with <hi>Thomas Aquinas,</hi> and all Thomists, that shee (as well as all <hi>Adams</hi> po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity) was borne in Originall. It was an act, the like whereof had not been so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverted in that University with arguments in <hi>contra,</hi> and their answers and solutions, and with reasons and arguments in <hi>pro</hi> many yeers before. The Jesuites stamped with their feet, clapt with their hands, railed with their tongues, and condemned it with their mouths for a heresie, saying, that in <hi>England,</hi> where were hereticks, such an opinion concerning Christs mother might bee held, and defended by mee who had my birth among hereticks, but that Master <hi>Cabannas</hi> borne among <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and brought up in their Universities, and being the chief Reader in that famous Academy should maintaine such an opinion, they could not but much marvaile and wonder at it. But with patience I told them, that strong reasons, and the further authority of many learned <hi>Thomist</hi> Divines should satisfie their vaine and clamorous wondring. The Act was ended, and though with Jesuites I could get no credit, yet with the Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicans, and with Master <hi>Cabannas,</hi> I got so much that I never after lost it for the space of almost twelve yeers; but was still honored by the meanes of this <hi>Cabannas</hi> and Fryer <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> the Prior of <hi>Chiapa</hi> (who at Christmas ensuing was made Prior of <hi>Guatemala</hi>) with honors and preferments as great as ever stranger was living among <hi>Spaniards.</hi> These two above named being at Candlemas or beginning of <hi>February</hi> that same yeer at <hi>Chiapa,</hi> at the election of a new Provinciall, would not forget mee their poorest friend stil abiding in <hi>Guatemala,</hi> but remembring that the University (which belonged chiefly to the Cloister) at Michaelmas would want a new Reader or Master of Arts to begin with Logick, continue through the eight bookes of Physicks, and to end with the Metaphysicks, propounded mee to the new elected Provincialll (whose name was Fryer <hi>Iohn Ximeno</hi>) and to the whole Chapter and Conventicle of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince for Reader of Arts in <hi>Guatemala</hi> the Michaelmas next ensuing.

                  <p>Thus with full and ample Commission from the Bishop and the Provinciall was I set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in <hi>Guatemala,</hi> to read and preach, where, (although I might have continued many yeers and was offered to read Divinity, having in part begun it one quarter of a yeere) I continued yet but three yeers and almost an halfe for the reason I shall shew hereafter. So what in that time I could observe of that City, and of the Countrey round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, having had occasions to travaile about it both when I lived in <hi>Guatemala,</hi> and afterwards when I lived for above seven yeers in the Countrey Townes, I shall truly and faithfully recommend unto my Reader. This City of <hi>Guatemala</hi> (called by the Spaniards <hi>Santiago,</hi> or <hi>St. Iames</hi> of <hi>Guatemala</hi> is seated in a valley, which is not above two miles and a halfe broad, for the high mountaines doe keep it close in; but in length towards the South-sea it continues a wide and champaigne Countrey, opening it selfe broader a little beyond that Towne, which to this day is called <hi>la Ciudad Vieja,</hi> or the old City, standing somewhat above three miles from <hi>Guatemala,</hi> Though the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines on each side doe strongly environ it, and especially on the East-side seem to hang over it, yet none of them are hinderers to Travellers, who over them have opened waies easi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap> for man and beasts though heavily laden with wares of all sorts. The way from <hi>Mexico,</hi> if taken by the coast of <hi>Socomezco,</hi> and <hi>Suchutepeques</hi> comes into the City North-west-ward, which is a wide, open and sandy rode; if it be taken by <hi>Chiapa,</hi> it lieth North<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>east, and entreth into the City between the mountaines, as before hath been noted. West-ward to the South-sea the way lieth open through the valley and a champaigne Countrey. But South or South-East, the entrance is over high and steepy hils, which is the common Rode from <hi>Comayagua, Nicaragua,</hi> and the <hi>Golfo dulce</hi> or sweet Gulfe, where the ships come yeerly and unlade all the Commodities which are brought from <hi>Spaine</hi> for <hi>Guatemala.</hi> This also is the way followed by them who take a journey meer East-ward from this City. But the chiefest mountaines, which straighten in this City and valley are two, called Vulcanes, the one being a Vulcan of water, and the other a Vulcan or mountain of fire, termed so by the <hi>Spantards,</hi> though very improperly a Vulcan may be said to containe water, it taking its name from the heathenish God <hi>Vulcan,</hi> whose profession and imployment chiefly was in fire. These two famous mountaines stand almost the one over against the other, on each side of the valley; that of water hanging on the South-side almost perpendicularly over the City, the other of fire standing lower from it, more opposite to the old City. That of water is higher then the other, and yeelds a goodly prospect to the sight, being almost all the yeer green, and full of <hi>Indian</hi> Milpa's, which are plantations of <hi>Indian</hi> wheat, and in the small and petty Townes which lie some halfe way up it, some at the foot of it, there are Roses, Lillies, and other flowers all the yeer long in the gardens, besides Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tins, Apricockes, and many sorts of sweet and delicate fruits. It is called by the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards, el Vulcan del agua,</hi> or the Vulcan of water, because on the other side of it from <hi>Guatemala</hi> it springs with many brookes towards a Towne called Saint <hi>Christopher,</hi> and especially is thought to preserve and nourish on that side also a great lake of fresh water, by the Townes called <hi>Amatitlan</hi> and <hi>Petapa.</hi> But on the side of it towards <hi>Guatemala</hi> and the valley it yeelds also so many springs of sweet and fresh water, as have caused and made a river which runneth along the valley close by the City, and is that which drives the water-mills spoken of before in <hi>

the City of <hi>Guatemala</hi> standing higher and neerer to the <hi>Vulcan</hi> in that place and Town which to this day is called <hi>la Ciudad Vieja,</hi> or the old City, there lived in it then about the yeer 1534. a Gentlewoman called <hi>Donna Maria de Castilia,</hi> who having l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>st her husband in the warres, and that same yeer buried also all her children, grew so im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient under these her crosses and afflictions, that impiously she defied God, saying, What can God do more unto me now then he hath done? he hath done his worst with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it be to take away my life also, which I now regard not. Upon these words there gushed out of this Vulcan such a flood of water as carried away this woman with the streame, ruined many of the houses, and caused the inhabitants to remove to the place where now standeth <hi>Guatemala.</hi> This is the <hi>Spaniards</hi> own Tradition, which if true, should be our example to learne to feare and not to defie God, when his judgements shew him to us angry and a God that will overcome, when he judgeth. From that time, and from this their Tradition is the Towne now standing where first stood <hi>Guatemala,</hi> called <hi>la Ciudad Vieja,</hi> or the old City, and hath continued a river which before was not knowne, having its head and spring from this high Vulcan, whose pleasant springs, gardens, fruits, flowers and every green and flourishing prospect might be a fair object to a <hi>Martials</hi> wit, who here would fancie a new <hi>Parnassus,</hi> find out new steps of flying <hi>Pegasus,</hi> and greet the Nymphes and nine Sisters with this their never yet discovered and <hi>American</hi> habitation. This Vulcan or mountaine is not so pleasing to the sight (whose height is judged full nine miles unto the top) but the other which standeth on the other side of the valley opposite unto it, is unpleasing and more dreadfull to behold; for here are ashes for beauty, stones and flints for fruits and flowers baldnesse for green<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, barrennesse for fruitfulnesse, for water whisperings and fountaine murmurs, noise of thunders and roaring of consuming metals, for running streams, flashings of fire, for tall and mighty trees and Cedars, Castles of smoak rising in height to out-dare the skie and firmament, for sweet and odoriserous and fragrant smels, a stink of fire and brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone, which are stil in action striving within the bowels of that ever burning and fiery Vulcan. Thus is <hi>Guatemala</hi> seated in the midst of a Paradise on the one side and a hell on the other, yet never hath this hell broke so loose as to consume that flourishing City. True it is formerly many yeers agoe it opened a wide mouth on the top, and breathed out such fiery ashes as filled the houses of <hi>Guatemala</hi> and the Country about, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched all the plants and fruits, and spued out such stones and rockes which had they fallen upon the City would have crushed it to pieces, but they fell not farre from it, but to this day lie about the bottome and sides of it, causing wonder to those that behold them, and taking away admiration from them that admire the force and strength of fire and powder in carrying on a weighty bullet from the mouth of a cannon, whereas here the fire of this mountaine hath cast up into the aire and tumbled downe to the bottom of it such rockes as in bignesse exceed a reasonable house, and which not the strength of any twenty Mules (as hath been tried) have been able to remove. The fire which flash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth out of the top of this mountain is sometimes more and sometimes lesse; yet while I lived in the City, on a certaine time for the space of three or foure dayes and nights it did so burne that my friend Mr. <hi>Cabamas</hi> confidently avouched to mee and others, that standing one night in his window he had with the light of that fire read a letter, the distance <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>ing above three <hi>English</hi> miles. The roaring also of this monstrous beast is not constantly alike, but is greater in the summer time then in the winter, that is, from <hi>October</hi> to the end of <hi>April,</hi> then all the rest of the yeer; for then it seems, the winds entring into those concavities set the fire on work harder then at other times, and cause the mountaine to roare and the earth about to quake: There was a time three yeers before my comming to that City, when the inhabitants expected nothing but utter ruine and destruction, and durst not abide within their houses for nine dayes (the earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quakes continuing and increasing more and more) but made bowers and arbours in the Market place, placing there their Idoll Saints and Images, especially St. <hi>Sebastian,</hi> whom they hoped would deliver them from that judgement, and for this purpose they dayly carried him through the streets in solemn and idolatrous procession and adoration. But all the while I lived there the noise within the mountaine, the smoake and flashes of fire without, and the Summer earth-quakes were such that with the use and custome of them I never feared any thing, but thought that City the healthiest and pleasantest place of dwelling that ever I came into in all my travels. The climate is very temperate, farre exceeding either <hi>Mexico</hi> or <hi>Guaxaca.</hi> Neither are the two fore-named Cities better

stored with fruits, herbes for salets, provision of fish, and flesh, Beef, Mutton, Veale, Kid, Fowles, Turkies, Rabbets, Quailes, Partridges, Pheasants, and of <hi>Indian</hi> and <hi>Spanish</hi> Wheat, then is this City: from the South Sea (which lyeth in some places not above twelve leagues from it) and from the Rivers of the South Sea Coast, and from the fresh Lake of <hi>Amatitlan</hi> and <hi>Petapa,</hi> and from another Lake lying three or foure leagues from <hi>Chimaltenango,</hi> it is well and plentifully provided for of fish. But for Beef there is such plenty, that it exceeds all parts of <hi>America,</hi> without exception, as may be known by the Hydes, which are sent yeerly to <hi>Spain</hi> from the country of <hi>Guatemala,</hi> where they commonly kill their Cattell, more for the gaine of their Hydes in <hi>Spain,</hi> then for the goodnesse or fatnesse of the flesh, which though it bee not to bee compared to our <hi>English</hi> Beef, yet it is good mans meat, and so cheap, that in my time it was commonly sold at thirteene pound and a halfe for half a Riall, the least coyne there, and as much as three pence here. Though all about this Country there are very great and spatious Estancia's, or Farmes for breeding onely, even neer to the <hi>Golfo Dulce's</hi> where the ships ride that come from <hi>Spain,</hi> yet from <hi>Comayagua,</hi> St. <hi>Salvador</hi> and <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caragua,</hi> is <hi>Guatemala</hi> stored; But above all are the great Estancia's in the South Sea Coast or Marsh, wherein my time there was a Grazier that reckoned up going in his owne Estancia and ground, forty thousand heads of Beasts, small and great, besides many which are called there Simarrones, or wild Cattell, which were strayed among the Woods and Mountaines, and could not bee gathered in with the rest, but were hunted by the Blackmores like wild Bores, and daily shot to death, least they should too much increase and doe hurt. My selfe chanced to bee present at the Fair of the Town of <hi>Petapa,</hi> with a friend named <hi>Lope de Chaves,</hi> (who was as they call there, Obligado, or charged to provide flesh for six or seven Townes thereabouts) who at one bargain, and of one man, bought six thousand head of Cattell, great and small, paying one with another eighteen Rials, or nine English shillings a head.</p>
                  <p>The manner and custome of <hi>Guatemala</hi> for the better providing both Beef and Mutton for it, and the Country Townes about, is this. Nine daies before Michaelmas, every day Proclamation is made about the City for an Obligado, or one that will bee bound to the City and Country for competent provision of Flesh meat upon forfei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of such a summe of money to his Majesty, if hee faile, as shall bee agreed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on between him and the Court, and to the Inhabitants of the City; if hee fail in beef, hee is to allow in Mutton so many pounds at the same rate as hee should have allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed beef. If the Obligado faile in Mutton, hee is to allow in Fowle flesh, so many pounds and at the same rate as hee was to allow the Mutton; and this with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration of the family, what competent allowance of flesh meat shall bee judged for a day, or the dayes that the Obligado shall fail. Besides this the Proclamation is made for whom offers most to his Majesty for one yeers Obligation. So that sometimes it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peneth that the eight daies severall men come into the Court, offering more and more, till upon the ninth day and last Proclamation, the Office is setled for one yeere upon him that hath offered most unto his Majesty. Thus many Butchers are not allowed but one onely Obligado, who also is abridged to so many pound for so much mony, so that if any other besides him offer to kill or sell, he may follow an action and the Court against him: Thus the Obligado (who commonly is a monied man) buyeth by the hundred or by the thousand, as for the present hee findeth the expence of the City, without hee bee himself such a Grazier, as hath Cattell enough of his owne. Though Mutton bee not so plentifull as is Beef, yet there never wants from the Valley of <hi>Mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co, Pinola, Petapa,</hi> and <hi>Amatitlan,</hi> and the <hi>Marsh</hi> and other places. In the Valley fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named I lived, and was well acquainted with one <hi>Alonso Capata,</hi> who had constantly going in the Valley four thousand sheep. <hi>Guatemala</hi> therefore is so well stored with good provision, plentifull and heap, that it is hard to finde in it a begger, for with halfe a Riall the poorest may buy beef for a weeke, and with a few Cacao's they may have bread of <hi>Indian</hi> Maiz, if not of <hi>Spanish</hi> Wheat. This City may consist of about five thousand families, besides a Suburb of <hi>Indians</hi> called <hi>el Barrio de Sto. Domingo,</hi> where may bee two hundred families more. The best part of the City is that which joyneth to this Suburb of <hi>Indians,</hi> and is called also <hi>el Barrio Santo de Domingo,</hi> by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the Cloister of Saint <hi>Dominick</hi> which standeth in it. Here are the richest and best shops of the City, with the best buildings, most of the houses being new, and ately. Here is also a dayly Tianguez (as they call it) or petty Market, where some
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:53246:69"/>
                     <hi>Indians</hi> all the day sit selling fruits, Herbs, and Cacao, but at the foure in the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noone, this Market is filled for a matter of an houre, where the <hi>Indian</hi> women meet to sell their Country slap, (which is dainties to the Criolians) as Atolle, Pinole, scalded Plantins, butter of the Cacao, puddings made of <hi>Indian</hi> Maiz, with a bit of Fowle or fresh Porke in them seasoned with much red biting Chile, which they call Anaca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tamales. The trading of the City is great, for by Mules it partakes of the best commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities of <hi>Mexico, Guaxaca</hi> and <hi>Chiapa,</hi> and Southward of <hi>Nicaragua,</hi> and <hi>Costarica.</hi> By Sea it hath commerce with <hi>Peru,</hi> by two Sea Ports and Havens, the one called <hi>la Villa de la Trinidad,</hi> the Village of the Trinity, which lyeth Southward from it five and twenty leagues; and by another called <hi>el Realejo,</hi> which lyeth five or six and forty leagues from it. It hath traffique with <hi>Spain</hi> by the North Sea from <hi>Golfo dulce,</hi> lying three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>score leagues from it. It is not so rich as other Cities, yet for the quantity of it, it yeelds to none. There were in my time five (besides many other Merchants who were judged worth twenty thousand Duckats, thirty thousand, fifty thousand, some few a hundred thousand) who were judged of equall wealth, and generally reported to bee worth each of them five hundred thousand Duckats; the first was <hi>Thomas de Silie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zer,</hi> a Biscain born, and <hi>Alcalde de Corte,</hi> the Kings High Justice, or chief Officer at Court; the second was <hi>Antonio Iustiniano,</hi> a <hi>Genovois</hi> born, and one that bore often Offices in the City, and had many Tenements and houses, especially a great and rich Farme for corn and Wheat in the Valley of <hi>Mexico.</hi> The third was <hi>Pedro de Lira,</hi> born in <hi>Castilia,</hi> the fourth and fifth, <hi>Antonio Fernandez,</hi> and <hi>Bartolome Nunnez,</hi> both <hi>Portin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gals,</hi> whereof the first in my time departed from <hi>Guatemala</hi> for some reasons which here I must conceale. The other foure I left there, the three of them living at that end of the City called <hi>Barrio de Santo Domingo,</hi> or the street of St. <hi>Dominick,</hi> whose houses and presence makes that street excell all the rest of the City, and their wealth and trading were enough to denominate <hi>Guatemala</hi> a very rich City. The Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all the Country about, and of all <hi>Honduras, Soconusco, Comayagua, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Vera Paz, Cuchutepeques,</hi> and <hi>Chiapa,</hi> is subordinate unto the Chancery of <hi>Cuatemala;</hi> for although every Governour over these severall Provinces is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by the King and Councell of <hi>Spain,</hi> yet when they come to those parts to the enjoyment of their charge and execution office, then their actions, if unjust, are weighed, judged, censured, and condemned by the Court residing in the City. This Court of Chancery consisteth of a President, six Judges, one Kings Attourney, and two chief Justices of Court. The President, though hee have not the name and title of Viceroy, as they of <hi>Mexico</hi> and <hi>Peru,</hi> yet his power is as great and absolute as theirs. His Pension from the King is but twelve thousands Duckats a yeer; but besides this, if he be covetous, hee makes by bribes and trading twice as much more, nay what shee list, as was seen in the <hi>Count de la Gomera,</hi> President of that City and Chancery for the space of fourteen yeers, who departed in old age from <hi>Guatemala</hi> to <hi>Canaria</hi> (where was his house and place of birth) worth Millions of Duckats. After him succeeded <hi>Don Iuan de Guzman,</hi> formerly President of <hi>Santo Domingo,</hi> who losing his Wife and Lady in the way, lost also his former spirit and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, betaking himselfe wholly to his devotions, contemning wealth and riches, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning with love and mildnesse, which made the rest of the Judges, who were all for lucre, soone weary him out of his office, continuing in it but five yeers. His succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor (whom I left there when I came away) was <hi>Don Gonsalo de Paz y Lorencana,</hi> who was promoted from the Presidency of <hi>Panama</hi> to that place, and came into it with such a spirit of covetousnesse as the like had not been seen in any former President. Hee forbad all gaming in private houses in the City, which there is much used (though by women not so much as in <hi>Mexico</hi>) not for that hee hated it, but because hee en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vied others, what they got and gained by their Cards, drawing to himselfe thereby all that gaine, spending sometimes in one night foure and twenty paire of Cards, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing a Page to assist at the Tables, and to see the box well paid for every paire of Cards, which for his, and his Court respect, was seldome lesse then a crown or two for every paire. Thus did hee lick up with his Cards most of the gamesters gaines, and would grudge and pick quarrels with such rich men whom hee knew to affect ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, if they frequented not his Court at night time for that bewitching Recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>The Pension which the King alloweth to every Judge of Chancery is foure thousand
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:53246:69"/>
duckats yeerly, and three thousand to his Attorney, all which is paid out of the Kings Exchequer abiding in that City. Yet what besides they get by bribes, and trading is so much, that I have heard a Judge himselfe <hi>Don Luis de las Infantas</hi> say, that though a Judges place at <hi>Mexico</hi> and <hi>Lima</hi> be more honourable, yet none more profitable then <hi>Guatemala.</hi> In my time were such causes at Chancery tried, as had never been, of mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, robberies, and oppressions, and whereas it was expected the offendants some should be hanged, some banished, some imprisoned, some by fines impoverished, bribes took all off, so that I never knew one hanged in that City for the space of above eight yeers. The Churches though they be not so fair and rich as those of <hi>Mexico,</hi> yet they are for that place wealthy enough. There is but one Parish Church and a Cathedrall which standeth in the chiefe Market-place. All the other Churches belong to Cloisters, which are of Dominicans, Franciscans, Mercenarians, Augustines, and Jesuites, and two of Nuns, called the Conception and <hi>St. Catharine.</hi> The Dominicans, Franciscans, and Mercenarians are stately Cloisters, containing neer a hundred Friers a piece; but above all is the Cloister where I lived, of the Dominicans, to which is joyned in a great Walk before the Church the Universitie of the City. The yeerly revenues which come into this Cloister, what from the <hi>Indian</hi> Towns belonging to it, what from a water-mill, what from a farme for corne, what from an Estancia, or farme for Horses and Mules, what from an Ingenio, or farme of Sugar, what from a Mine of silver given unto it the yeer 1633. are judged to be (excepting all charges) at least thirty thousand duckats; wherewith those fat Friers feast themselves, and have to spare to build, and enrich their Church and Altars. Besides much treasure belonging to it, there are two things in it, which the <hi>Spaniards</hi> in merriment would often tell me that the <hi>English</hi> nation did much inquire after, when they tooke any ship of theirs at sea, and that they feared I was come to spie them, which were a Lampe of silver hanging before the high Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, so big as required th strength of three men to hale it up with a rope; but the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is of more value; which is a picture of the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> of pure silver, and of the stature of a reasonable tall woman, which standeth in a Tabernacle made on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose in a Chappel of the Rosary with at least a dozen lampes of silver also burning be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it. A hundred thousand duckats might soone be made up of the treasure belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging to that Church and cloister. Within the walls of the Cloister there is nothing wanting which may further pleasure and recreation. In the lower Cloister there is a spatious garden, in the midst whereof is a fountaine casting up the water, and spou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it out of at least a dozen pipes, which fill two ponds full of fishes, and with this their constant running give musicke to the whole Cloister, and encouragement to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny water-fowles and Ducks to bath and wash themselves therein. Yet further within the Cloister, there are other two gardens for fruits and herbage, and in the one a pond of a quarter of a mile long, all paved at the bottom, and a low stone wall about, where is a boat for the Friers recreation, who often goe thither to fish, and doe sometimes upon a suddaine want or occasion take out from thence as much fish as will give to the whole Cloister a dinner. The other Cloisters of the City are also rich; but next to the Dominicans is the Cloister of Nuns, called the Conception<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in which at my time there were judged to live a thousand women, not all Nuns, but Nuns, and their ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving maids or slaves, and yong children which were brought up and taught to worke by the Nuns. The Nuns that are professed bring with them their portions, five hundred duckats the least, some six hundred, some seven, and some a thousand, which portions after a few yeers (and continuing to the Cloister after the Nuns decease) come to make up a great yeerly rent. They that will have maids within to wait on them may, brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging the bigger portion, or allowing yeerly for their servants diet. In this Cloister li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that <hi>Donna Iuana de Maldonado</hi> Judge <hi>Iuan Maldonado de Paz</hi> his daughter, whom the Bishop so much conversed withall. She was very fair and beautifull, and not much above twenty yeers of age, and yet his love blinding him, he strove what he could in my time against all the ancient Nuns and Sisters, to make her Superiour and Abbesse, and caused such a mutiny and strife in that Cloister, which was very scandalous to the whole City, and made many rich Merchants and Gentlemen run to the Cloister with their swords drawne, threatning to breake<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in amongst the Nuns to defend their daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters against the powerfull faction which the Bishop had wrought for <hi>Donna Iuana de Maldenado:</hi> which they had performed if the President <hi>Don Iuan de Guzman</hi> had not sent <hi>Iuan Maldonado de Paz,</hi> the yong Nuns father, to intreat her to desist in regard
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:53246:70"/>
of her yong age from her ambitious thoughts of being Abbesse. With this the mutiny both within and without ceased, the Bishop got but shame, and his yong Sister continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as before under command and obedience, to a more religious, grave, and aged Nun then her selfe. This <hi>Donna Iuana de Maldonado y Paz</hi> was the wonder of all that Cloister, yea of all the City for her excellent voice, and skill in musicke, and in carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, and education yeelded to none abroad nor within; she was witty, well spoken and above all a <hi>Calliope,</hi> or Muse for ingenious and suddain verses; which the Bishop said, so much moved him to delight in her company and conversation. Her father thought nothing too good, nor too much for her; and therefore having no other children, he daily conferred upon her riches, as might best beseem a Nun, as rich and costly Cabinets faced with gold and silver, pictures and Idols for her chamber with crownes and jewels to adorne them; which with other presents from the Bishop (who dying in my time left not wherewith to pay his debts, for that as the report went, he had spent himselfe and given all unto this Nun) made this <hi>Donna Iuana de Maldona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do</hi> so rich and stately, that at her owne charges shee built for herselfe a new quarter within the Cloister with roomes and galleries, and a private garden-walke, and kept at worke and to wait on her halfe a dozen <hi>Black-more</hi> maids; but above all she placed her delight in a private Chappel or Closet to pray in, being hung with rich hangings, and round about it costly lamina's (as they call them) or pictures painted upon brasse set in blacke Ebony frames with corners of gold, some of silver brought to her from <hi>Rome;</hi> her Altar was accordingly decked with Jewels, Candlesticks, Crownes, Lamps, and covered with a Canopie embroidered with gold; in her Closet she had her small organ, and many sorts of musicall instruments, whereupon she played sometimes by herselfe, sometimes with her best friends of the Nuns; and here especially she enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained with musicke her beloved the Bishop. Her Chappel or place of devotion was credibly reported about the City to be worth at least six thousand, which was enough for a Nun that had vowed chastity, poverty, and obedience. But all this after her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cease she was to leave to the Cloister; and doubtlesse with this State, and riches she would win more and more the hearts of the common sort of Nuns, till she had made a strong party, which by this may have made her Abbesse. Thus is ambition and desire of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand and power crept into the walls of Nunneries, like the abominations in the wall of <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> and hath possessed the hearts of Nuns, which should be humble, poore, and mortified Virgins.</p>
                  <p>But besides this one Nun, there are many more, and also Friers, who are very rich, for if the City be rich (as is this) and great trading in it, they will be sure to have a share.

This is the City of <hi>St. Iames</hi> or <hi>Santiago de Guatemala,</hi> the head of a vaste and ample Dominion, which extendeth it selfe nine hundred miles to <hi>Nicoya</hi> and <hi>Costa Rica</hi> South-ward; three hundred miles to <hi>Chiapa</hi> and <hi>Zoques</hi> North-ward; a hundred and fourescore miles to the further parts of <hi>Vera Paz,</hi> and the <hi>Golfo dulce</hi> East-ward; and to the South-sea twenty or thirty, in some places fourty miles West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</p>

Nay while I lived there, the <hi>Hollanders</hi> set upon <hi>Truxillo</hi> the head Port of <hi>Comayagua</hi> and <hi>Honduras,</hi> and tooke it (though there were some resistance) the people for the most part flying to the woods, trusting more to their feet then to their hands and weapons) such cowards is all that Countrey full of) and whilst they might have fortified themselves there and gone into the Countrey, or fortifying that have come on to the Golfe (all <hi>Guatemala</hi> fearing it much and not being able to resist them) they left <hi>Truxillo</hi> contenting themselves with a small pillage, and gave occasion to the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi> to rejoyce and to make processions of thanksgiving for their safe deliverance out of their enemies hands.</p>
                  <p>The way from this Golfe to <hi>Guatemala</hi> is not so bad as some report and conceive, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially after <hi>Michaelmas</hi> untill <hi>May,</hi> when the winter and rain is past and gone, and the winds begin to dry up the waies. For in the worst of the yeer Mules laden with four hundred waight at least goe easily thorow the steepest, deepest, and most dangerous passages of the mountaines that lie about this Golfe. And though the waies are at that time of the yeer bad, yet they are so beaten with the Mules, and so wide and open, that one bad step and passage may be avoided for a better; and the worst of this way continues but fifteen leagues, there being Rancho's, or Lodges in the way, Cattel and Mules also among the woods and mountaines, for reliefe and comfort to a weary Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veller. What the <hi>Spaniards</hi> most feare untill they come out of these mountaines, are some two or three hundred <hi>Black-mores, Simarrones,</hi> who for too much hard usage, have fled away from <hi>Guatemala</hi> and other parts from their Masters unto these woods, and there live and bring up their children and encrease daily, so that all the power of <hi>Gua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temala,</hi> nay all the Countrey about (having often attempted it) is not able to bring them under subjection.

Their weapons are bowes and arrows which they use and carry about them, onely to defend themselves, if the <hi>Spaniards</hi> set upon them; else they use them not against the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who travell quietly and give them part of what provision they carry. These have often said that the chiefe cause of their flying to those mountaines is to be in a readinesse to joyne with the <hi>English</hi> or <hi>Hollan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi> if ever they land in that Golfe; for they know, from them they may injoy that liberty which the <hi>Spaniards</hi> will never grant unto them. After the first fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen leagues the way is better, and there are little Towns and villages of <hi>Indians,</hi> who relieve with provision both man and beast. Fifteen leagues further is a great Town of <hi>Indians,</hi> called <hi>Acabastlan,</hi> standing upon a river, which for fish is held the best all that Country. Though here are many sorts, yet above all there is one which they call Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bo, a thick round fish as long or longer then a mans arme, with onely a middle bone, as white as milke, at fat as butter, and good to boil, fry, stew or bake. There is also from hence most of the way to <hi>Guatemala</hi> in brooks and shallow rivers, one of the best sort of fishes in the world, which the <hi>Spaniards</hi> judge to be a kind of Trout, it is called there Tepemechin, the fat whereof resembles veal more than fish.</p>
                  <p>This Towne of <hi>Acabastlan</hi> is governed by a <hi>Spaniard</hi> who is called Corrigidor; his house extendeth no farther then to the Golfe, and to those Townes in the way.

From hence to <hi>Guatemala,</hi> there are but thirty short leagues, and though some hills there be, ascents and descent, yet nothing troublesome to man or beast. Among these Mountaines there have beene discovered some mines of metall, which the <hi>Spaniards</hi> have begun to digge, and finding that they have been some of Copper, and some of iron, they have let them alone, judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them more chargeable then profitable. But greater profit have the <hi>Spaniards</hi> lost, then of iron and copper, for using the poore <hi>Indians</hi> too hardly, and that in this way, from <hi>Acacabastlan</hi> to <hi>Guatemala,</hi> especially about a place called, <hi>el Agua Caliente</hi> the hot water, where is a River, out of which in some places formerly the <hi>Indians</hi> found such store of gold, that they were charged by the <hi>Spaniards</hi> with a yeerly tribute of gold. But the <hi>Spaniards</hi> being like <hi>Valdivia</hi> in <hi>Chille,</hi> too greedy after it, murthering the <hi>Indians</hi> for not discovering unto them whereabout this treasure lay, have lost both treasure and <hi>Indians</hi> also. Yet unto this day search is made about the Mountaines, the River, and the sands for the hidden treasure, which peradventure by Gods order and appointment, doth and shall lie hide, and kept for a people better knowing and honouring their God. At this place called <hi>el Agua Caliente,</hi> or the hot water, liveth a Blackmore in an Estancia of his own, who is held to be very rich, and gives good enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainement to the Travellers that passe that way; he is rich in Cattell, Sheep, and Goates, and from his Farm stores <hi>Guatemala</hi> and the people thereabout with the best Cheese of all that Country. But his riches are thought not so much to increase from his Farm and cheeses, but from this hidden treasure, which credibly is reported to be known unto him. He hath been questioned about it in the Chancery of <hi>Guatemala,</hi> but hath denyed often any such treasure to be known unto him. The jealousie and suspicion of him, is, for that formerly having been a slave, hee bought his freedome with great summes of money, and since hee hath been free, hath bought that farm and much land lying to it, and hath exceedingly increased his stock; To which hee answereth, that when hee was young and a slave, hee had a good Master, who let him get for himself what hee could, and that hee playing the good husband, gathered as much as would buy his liberty, and at first a little house to live in, to the which God hath since given a blessing with a greater increase of stock. From this hot water three or foure leagues, there is another River called, <hi>Rio de las Vaccas,</hi> or the River of <hi>Cow<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

From this River is presently discovered the pleasantest valley in all that Country, (where my selfe did live at least five yeers) called the Valley of <hi>Mixco,</hi> and <hi>Pinola,</hi> lying six leagues from <hi>Guatemala,</hi> being fifteen miles in length, and ten or twelve in breadth; Out of the inclosures this Valley is stored with sheep; the ground inclosed is divided into many Farmes, where groweth better wheat then any in the Country of <hi>Mexico.</hi> From this Valley the city is well provided of wheat, and Bisket is made for the ships that come every yeere unto the Golf. It is called the Valley of <hi>Mixco,</hi> and <hi>Pinola</hi> from two Townes of <hi>Indians,</hi> so called, standing opposite the one to the other on each side of the Valley, <hi>Pinola,</hi> on the left side from <hi>Rio delas Vaccas,</hi> and <hi>Mixco</hi> on the right. Here do live many rich Farmers, but yet Country and clownish people, who know more of breaking clods of earth, then of managing Armes offensive or defensive. But among them I must not forget one friend of mine, called <hi>Iuan Palomeque,</hi> whom I should have more esteemed of then I did if I could have prevailed with him to have made him live more like a man then a beast, more like a free men then a bond slave to his gold and silver. This man had in my time three hundred lusty mules trained up in the way of the Golf, which hee divided into six Requa's, or
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:53246:72"/>
companies; and for them be kept above a hundred <hi>Black-more</hi> slaves, men, women, and children, who lived neer <hi>Mixco</hi> in severall thatched cottages. The house he lived in himselfe was but a poore thatched house, wherein he tooke more delight to live then in other houses which he had in <hi>Guatemala,</hi> for there hee lived like a wilde <hi>Simarron</hi> among his slaves and <hi>Black-mores,</hi> whereas in the City he should have lived civilly; there he lived with milke, curds, and blacke, hard and mouldy bisket, and with a dry tassajo, which is dry salted beefe cut out in thinne slices, and dryed in the sun and wind, till there be little substance left in it, such as his slaves were wont to cary to the Golfe for their provision by the way, whereas if he had lived in the City, he must have eat for his credit what others of worth did eat. But the miser knew well, which was the best way to save, and so chose a field for a City, a cottage for a house, company of <hi>Simarrones</hi> and <hi>Black-mores</hi> for Citizens, and yet he was thought to be worth six hundred thousand duckats. He was the undoer of all others who dealed with Mules for bringing and carrying commodities to the Golfe for the Merchants; for he having lusty Mules, lusty slaves, would set the price or rate for the hundred weight so, as he might get, but others at that rate hiring <hi>Indians</hi> and servants to goe with their Mules, might lose. He was so cruell to his <hi>Black-mores,</hi> that if any were untoward, he would torment them almost to death; amongst whom he had one slave called <hi>Macaco</hi> (for whom I have often interceded, but to little purpose) whom he would often hang up by the armes, and whip him till the blood ran about his back, and then his flesh being torne, mangled, and all in a goar blood, he would for last cure powre boyling grease upon it; he had marked him for a slave with burning irons upon his face, his hands, his armes, his back, his belly, his thighes, his legs, that the poor slave was weary of life, and I thinke would two or three times have hanged him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, if I had not counselled him to the contrary. He was so sensuall and carnall that he would use his own slaves wives at his pleasure; nay when he met in the City a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of that kind handsome and to his liking, if she would not yeeld to his desire, he would goe to her master or mistresse, and buy her, offering far more then she was worth, boasting that he would pull downe her proud and haughty lookes, with one yeers sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very under him. He killed in my time two <hi>Indians</hi> in the way to the Golfe, and with his mony came off, as if he had killed but a dog. He would never marry, because his slaves supplyed the bed of a wife, and none of his neighbours durst say him nay; whereby he hasted to fill that valley with bastards of all sorts and colours, by whom, when that rich miser dieth, all his wealth and treasure is like to be consumed.</p>
                  <p>Besides the two Townes which denominate this valley, there standeth at the East end of it close by the <hi>Rio de las Vaccas</hi> an Ermitage, called <hi>Nostra Sennora del Carmel,</hi> or our Lady of <hi>Carmel,</hi> which is the Parish Church to all those severall farmes of <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi> living in the valley; though true it is, most constantly they doe resort unto the <hi>Indian</hi> Townes to Masse, and in <hi>Mixco</hi> especially, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> have a rich sodality of our Lady of the Rosary, and the <hi>Black-mores</hi> another. In all the valley there may be between fourty and fifty <hi>Spanish</hi> farmes or houses belonging to the Ermitage, and in all these houses, some three hundred slaves, men and women, <hi>Black-mores</hi> and <hi>Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latto's.

Besides what fowles and great store of Turkeys which in this Towne are bred, there is a constant slaughter house, where meat is sold to the <hi>Indians</hi> within, and to the farmes without, and provision is made for all the Requa's and slaves that go to the Golfe with their masters Mules.

Yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides these there are some six more Requa's belonging to other farms, which with those of the Towne of <hi>Mixco</hi> may makeup full twenty Requa's; and those twenty Requa's containe above a thousand Mules, which only from this valley are imployed to all parts of the Country by the rich Merchants of <hi>Guatemala.</hi> But to returne againe to the Towne of <hi>Mixco,</hi> the constant passage thorow it of these Requa's, of rich Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, of all passengers that goe and come from <hi>Spain,</hi> hath made it very rich; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as

in the Town it self there is no other commodity, except it be a kind of earth, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of are made rare and excellent pots for water, pans, pipkins, platters, dishes, cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fing-dishes, warming-pans, wherein those <hi>Indians</hi> shew much wit, and paint them with red, white, and severall mingled colours, and sell them to <hi>Guatemala,</hi> and the Towns about, which some Criolian women will eat by full mouth fulls, endangering their health and lives, so that by this earthly ware they may looke white and pale. The Towne of <hi>Pinola</hi> in bignesse is much like unto <hi>Mixco,</hi> but a far pleasanter Town, more healthy and better seated, standing upon a plain, whereas <hi>Mixco</hi> stands on the side on a hill, which carrieth the Travellers quite out of the sight of the valley. In <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nola</hi> there is also a slaughter house, whete beef is dayly sold, there is plenty of fowles, Fruits, Maiz, Wheat, (though not altogether so bright as that of <hi>Mixco</hi>) hony, and the best water thereabouts; it is called in the <hi>Indian</hi> tongue <hi>Panac,</hi> (some say) from a fruit of that name which is very abundant there. On the North and South side of this valley are hils, which are most sown with wheat, which proveth better there then in the low valley. At the West end of it, stand two greater Townes then <hi>Mixco</hi> and <hi>Pinola,</hi> named <hi>Petapa,</hi> and <hi>Amatitlan,</hi> to the which there are in the midst of the val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley some descents and ascents, which they call Baranca's or bottomes, where are plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant streames and fountaines, and good feeding for sheep, and Cattel.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Petapa</hi> is a Towne of at least five hundred inhabitants very rich, who suffer also some <hi>Spaniards</hi> to dwell amongst them, from whom also those <hi>Indians</hi> have learned to live and thrive in the world. This Towne is the passage from <hi>Comayagua, St. Salvador, Nicaragua,</hi> and <hi>Costa Rica,</hi> and hath got great wealth by the constant goers and comers. It is esteemed one of the pleasantest Townes belonging unto <hi>Guatemala,</hi> for a great Lake of fresh water neer unto it, which is full of fish, especially crabs, and a fish called, Mojarra, which is much like unto a mullet (though not altogether so big) and eateth like it. In this Towne there is a certaine number of <hi>Indians</hi> appointed, who are to fish for the City, and on Wednesdayes, Fridayes, and Saturdayes, are bound to carry such a quantity to <hi>Guatemala,</hi> of Crabs and Mojarra's, as the Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gidor and Regidores, Major and Aldermen (who are but eight) shall command week<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be brought.</p>
                  <p>This Towne <hi>Petapa</hi> is so called from two <hi>Indian</hi> words, <hi>Petap,</hi> which signifieth a Mat, and <hi>ha,</hi> which signifieth water, and a Mat being the chiefe part of an <hi>Indians</hi> bed, it is as much as to say a bed of water, from the smoothnesse, plainnesse, and calm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the water of the Lake. There liveth in it a principall family of <hi>Indians,</hi> who are said to descend from the ancient Kings of those parts, and now by the <hi>Spaniards</hi> are graced with the noble name of <hi>Guzman;</hi> out of this family is chosen one to be Governour of the Towne with subordination unto the City and Chancery of <hi>Guate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mala. Don Bernabe de Guzman</hi> was Governour in my time, and had been many yeers before, and governed very wisely and discreetly, till with old age he came to loose his sight; and in his place entred his son <hi>Don Pedro de Guzman,</hi> of whom the rest of the <hi>Indians</hi> stood in great awe, as formerly they had to his father. Had not these <hi>Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> been given to drunkennesse (as most <hi>Indians</hi> are) they might have governed a Town of <hi>Spaniards.</hi> This Governour hath many priviledges granted unto him (though none to weare a sword, or rapier, as may the Governour of <hi>Chiapa</hi> of the <hi>Indians</hi>) and appoints by turnes some of the Towne to wait and attend on him at dinner and supper, others to looke to his Horses, others to fish for him, others to bring him wood for his house spending, others to bring him meat for his Horses; and yet after all this his attendance, he attends and waits on the Frier that lives in the Towne, and doth nothing concerning the governing of the Towne and executing of justice, but what the Frier alloweth and adviseth to be done. There is also great service appointed for this Frier, of Fishermen, and other attendants in his house, who liveth as state<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as any Bishop. Most trades belonging to a well setled Common-wealth are here ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercised by these <hi>Indians.</hi> As for herbage, and garden-fruits, and requisites, it hath what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever may be found, or desired in the City of <hi>Guatemala.</hi> The Church treasure is very great, there being many Sodalities of our Lady and other their Saints, which are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riched with crowns, and chains, and bracelets, besides the lamps, censers, &amp; silver candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticks belonging unto the Altars. Upon <hi>Michaelmas</hi> day is the chief fair and feast of the Town, which is dedicated unto St. <hi>Michael,</hi> whither many Merchants resort from <hi>Gua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temala</hi> to buy and sell; in the afternoon, and the next day following, Bul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

common sport for that feast with some <hi>Spaniards</hi> and <hi>Blackmores</hi> on Horse-backe, and other <hi>Indians</hi> on foot, who commonly being drunke, some venture, some lose their lives in the sport. Besides this generall concourse of people every yeer at that time, there is every day at five a clock in the afternoone a Tianguez or market, upheld by the concourse of the <hi>Indians</hi> of the Town among themselves. Besides the lake, there run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth by this Town a river, which in places is easily waded over, and waters the fruits, gardens, and other plantations, and drives a mill which serves most of the valley to grind their wheat. Within a mile and a halfe of this Towne there is a rich Ingenio or farme of Sugar belonging to one <hi>Sebastian de Savaletta,</hi> a <hi>Biscaine</hi> borne, who came at first very poore into that Country, and served one of his Country men; but with his good industry and paines, he began to get a Mule or two to traffique with about the Country, till at last he increased his stocke to a whole Requa of Mules, and from thence grew so rich that he bought much land about <hi>Petapa,</hi> which he found to be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry fit for Sugar, and from thence was incouraged to build a princely house, whither the best of <hi>Guatemala</hi> doe resort for their recreation. This man maketh a great deale of Sugar for the Country, and sends every yeer much to <hi>Spaine;</hi> he keepeth at least threescore slaves of his own for the worke of his farme, is very generous in house kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, and is thought to be worth above five hundred thousand Duckats. Within halfe a mile from him there is another farme of Sugar, which is called but a <hi>Trapiche</hi> belonging unto the Augustin Friers of <hi>Guatemala,</hi> which keepes some twenty slaves, and is called a <hi>Trapiche,</hi> for that it grinds not the Sugar Cane with that device of the Ingenio, but grinds a lesse quantity, and so makes not so much Sugar as doth an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genio. From hence three miles is the Town of <hi>Amatitlan,</hi> neer unto which standeth a greater Ingenio of Sugar, then is that of <hi>Savaletta,</hi> and is called the Ingenio of one <hi>Anis,</hi> because he first founded it, but now it belongeth unto one <hi>Pedro Crespo</hi> the Post<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>master of <hi>Guatemala;</hi> this Ingenio seemeth to be a little Town by it selfe for the many cottages and thatched houses of <hi>Blackmore</hi> slaves which belong unto it, who may be above a hundred, men, women, and children. The chiefe dwelling house is strong and capacious, and able to entertain a hundred lodgers. These three farmes of Sugar standing so neer unto <hi>Guatemala,</hi> enrich the City much, and occasion great trading from it to <hi>Spaine.</hi> The Town of <hi>Amatitlan,</hi> though in it there live not so many <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi> as in <hi>Petapa,</hi> yet there are in it more <hi>Indian</hi> families then in <hi>Petapa.</hi> The streets are more orderly made and framed like a Chequer board, they are wide, broad, plain, and all upon dust and sand. This Towne also enjoyeth the commodity of the lake, and furnisheth with fish the City of <hi>Guatemala,</hi> upon those daies before named of <hi>Peta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pa.</hi> And though it standeth out of the rode-way, yet it is almost as rich as <hi>Petapa.</hi> For the <hi>Indians</hi> of it get much by the concourse of common people, and the Gentry of <hi>Guatemala,</hi> who resort thither to certain bathes of hot waters, which are judged and approved very wholesome for the body. This Towne also getteth much by the salt which here is made, or rather gathered by the lake side, which every morning ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth like a hoary frost upon the ground, and is taken up and purified by the <hi>Indians,</hi> and proves very white and good. Besides what they get by the salt, they get also by the Requa's of Mules in the valley, and about the Country, which are brought to feed upon that salt earth a day, or halfe a day, untill they be ready to burst (the ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner paying six pence a day for every Mule) and it hath been found by experience, that this makes them thrive and grow lusty and purgeth them better then any drench, or blood-letting. They have further great trading in Cotton-wool, more abundance of fruits then <hi>Petapa,</hi> a fairer market place with two extraordinary great Elm-trees, under which the <hi>Indians</hi> daily meet at evening to buy and sell. The Church of this Towne is as faire and beautifull as any about <hi>Guatemala,</hi> the riches and state whereof hath caused the Dominican Friers since the yeer 1635, to make that place the head and Priory over the other Townes of the valley, and to build there a goodly and sumptuous Cloister, in which in my time there was (for I told then most of it, and doubtlesse since it hath much increased) eight thousand Duckats laid up in a chest, with three lockes for the common expences of the Cloister. Thus my Reader, I have led thee through the val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley of <hi>Mixes,</hi> and <hi>Pinola, Petapa</hi> and <hi>Amititlan,</hi> which in riches and wealth, what with the great trading in it, what with the sheep &amp; cattell, what with the abundance of mules, what with thres Farmes of Sugar, what with the great Farmes of Corn and Wheat, what with the Churches treasures yeelds to no other place belonging unto the dominions

of <hi>Guatemala.</hi> I may not forget yet a double wheat harvest (as I may well term it) in this Vally. The first being of a little kinde of Wheat, which they call <hi>Trigo Tremesino,</hi> a word compounded in <hi>Spanish</hi> from these two words, <hi>tres meses,</hi> or from the Latin <hi>tresmenses</hi>) which after three moneths sowing is ripe and ready to be cut down, and being sowed about the end of <hi>August,</hi> is commonly harvested in about the end of <hi>November</hi> and although in the smalnesse of it, it seemes to have but a little Flower, yet it yeelds as much as their other sorts of Wheat, and makes as white bread, though it keep not so well as that which is made of other Wheat, but soone groweth stale and hard. The other harvest (which is of two sorts of Wheat, one called <hi>Rubio,</hi> or red Wheat, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther called <hi>Blanquilleo,</hi> or white like <hi>Candia</hi> Wheat) followeth soon after this first of <hi>Tremesino,</hi> for presently after Christmas every one begins to bring theis sickles into the field, where they doe not onely reap down their Wheat, but in stead of threshing it in barnes, they cause it to bee trod by Mares inclosed within floores made on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose in the fields; and when the Wheat is trod out of the Eares by the Mares tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pling, who are whipped round about the floores that they may not stand still, but tread it constantly and throughly; then the Mares being let out of the floores, the wheat is winnowed from the chaffe, and put up clean into sackes, and from the field carried to the Barnes; but the chaffe and most of the straw is left to rot in the fields, which they esteem as good as dunging; and further set all the fields on fire, burning the stubble that is left a little before the time of the first showers of raine, which with the ashes left after the burning fatteth the ground, and by them is held the best way to hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band or dung their ground. Others that will sow a new and woody peece of land, cause the trees, though timber trees to bee cut down, and sell not a stick of that wood, (which there is so plentifull, that they judge it would not quit their cost to carry it to <hi>Guatemala,</hi> though in <hi>England</hi> it would yeeld thousand pounds) but they let it lie and dry, and before the winter raine begins, they set on fire all the field, and burn that rich timber, with the ashes whereof that ground becomes so fat and fertile, that where upon an Aker wee sow here three bushels of Wheat, or upwards, they sow such ground so thin, that they scarce dare venture a full bushell upon an Aker, lest with too much spreading upon the ground it grow too thick, bee lodged, and they loose their crop. The like they doe unto the pasture of the Valley; about the end of <hi>March,</hi> it is short and withered and dry, and they also set it on fire, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing burnt causeth a dismall sight, and prospect of a black valley; but after the first two or three showres, it puts on againe its greene and pleasant garment, inviting the Cattell, Sheep, Lambs, Goats, and Kids, (which for a while were driven away to other pasturing) to return and sport againe, to feed and rest in its new flourishing bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some. But now it is time, I return again back to the other end of this valley, to the <hi>Rio de las Vacas</hi> (from whence I have viewed the compasse of it, and made my long digression from East to West, to the farthest Towne of <hi>Amatitlan</hi>) to shew thee, my Reader, the little part of thy way remaining unto <hi>Guatemala.</hi> True it is, from the Ermitage of our Lady, there is a streight way through the middle of the valley leading almost to <hi>Amatitlan,</hi> and then turning up a hill out of the valley on the right hand; But that hath many ascents and descents, bottomes, falls and risings, and therefore is not the constant Rode, which from the Ermitage pointeth on the right hand, observing the Towne of <hi>Mixco,</hi> standing but five miles from <hi>Guatemala,</hi> from <hi>Mixco</hi> the way lyeth up a hill, and leadeth to a Town somewhat bigger then <hi>Mixco,</hi> of <hi>Indians</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>San Lucas,</hi> or St. <hi>Luke,</hi> a cold Town, but exceeding rich; the temper and cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of it, hath made it the storehouse, or Granary for all the City; for whereas be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low in the Valley; the Wheat will not keep long without musting, and breeding a worm called <hi>Gurgejo,</hi> such is the temper of this Town of St. <hi>Luke,</hi> that in it, the Wheat will keep two or three yeeres ready threshed, with a little turning now and then; and as it lyeth will give and yeeld, (as experience taught mee there) so that he that hath laid up in that Town two hundred bushels of Wheat, at the yeers end shall find neer upon two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and twenty bushels. This Towne therefore receives from the Valley most of the harvest, and is full of what wee call Barnes, but there are called <hi>Trojas,</hi> without floores, but raised up with stackes and bords a foot or two from the ground, and covered with mats, whereon is laid the Wheat, and by some rich Monopolists from the City is kept and hoarded two and three yeers, untill they find their best opportunity to bring it out to sale, at the rate of their own will and pleasure<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> From hence to

                     <hi>Guatemala</hi> there is but three little leagues, and one onely <hi>Barranca,</hi> or bottome, and on every side of the way little petty Townes, which they call <hi>Milpas,</hi> consisting of some twenty Cottages. In the middle of the way is the top of a hill, which discovereth all the City, and standeth as overmastring of it, as if with a peece or two of Ordnance it would keepe all <hi>Guatemala</hi> in awe; But besides this hill, which is the wide and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen Rode, there stand yet forwarder on the right and left hand other mountaines which draw neerer to the City, and what this top peradventure with too much di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, is not able to doe or reach, the others certainly would reach with Cannon shot, and command that farre commanding City. Downe this hill the way lies broad and wide, and as open as is the way downe <hi>Barnet</hi> or <hi>Higggate</hi> Hill; and at the bottome it is more straitned betweene the Mountaines, for the space of a bowshot, which pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage also is craggy by reason of stones and some small peeces of rocks which lie in a brook of water that descends from the Mountaines, and runs towards the City. But at a little Ermitage called St. <hi>Iohn,</hi> the way opens againe it selfe, and sheweth <hi>Guatema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la,</hi> welcoming the weary travellers with a pleasant prospect, and easing theirs, or their mules or horses feet, what with green walkes, what with a sandy and gravelly Rode unto the City, which never shut gate against any goer or comer, nor forbad their entrance with any fenced walls, or watchmens jealous questions, but freely and gladly entertaines them either by the back side of the Dominicans Cloister, or by the Church and Nunnery called the Conception. And thus my Reader, and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try man I have brought and guided thee from the Golfe unto <hi>Guatemala,</hi> shewing what that way is most remarkable. I shall not now shew thee any more of this Cities Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions toward <hi>Nicaragua</hi> and the South (having already shewed thee the way as far as <hi>Realejo</hi>) leaving that untill I come to tell thee of my journey homewards, which I made that way. There remaines yet the Country of the <hi>Vera Paz</hi> and the way unto it to discover, and so to close up this Chapter. The <hi>Vera Paz</hi> is so called, for that the <hi>Indians</hi> of that Country hearing how the <hi>Spaniards</hi> had conquered <hi>Guatemala,</hi> and did conquer the Country round about, wheresoever they came, yeelded themselves peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably and without any resistance unto the Government of <hi>Spaine.</hi> This Country for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly had a Bishop to it selfe distinct from <hi>Guatemala,</hi> but now is made one Bishoprick with that. It is governed by an Alcalde Maior, or high Justice sent from <hi>Spain,</hi> with sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordination unto the Court of <hi>Guatemala.</hi> The head or shire Town of it, is called <hi>Coban,</hi> where is a Cloister of Dominican Friers, and the common place of Residence of the Alcalde Maior. All this Country as yet is not subdued by the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who have now and then some strong encounters with the barbarous and heathen people, which lie between this Country and <hi>Iucatan;</hi> and faine would the <hi>Spaniards</hi> conquer them, that they might make way through them unto a Town called <hi>Campin</hi> belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Iucatan,</hi> and settle commerce, and Traffique by land with that Country, which is thought would bee a great furtherance to the Country and City of <hi>Guatema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la,</hi> and a safer way to convey their goode to the Havana, then by the Golf, for often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the ships that goe from the Golf to the Havana, are met with by the <hi>Hollanders</hi> and surprised. But as yet the <hi>Spaniards</hi> have not been able to bring to passe this their design, by reason they have found strong resistance from the heathenish people, and a hot service to attempt the conquering of them. Yet there was a Fryer a great acquaintance of mine, called Fryer <hi>Franciseo Moran,</hi> who ventured his life among those barbarians, and with two or three <hi>Indians</hi> went on foot through that Country, untill he came unto <hi>Campin,</hi> where he found a few <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who wondred at his courage and boldnesse in comming that way. This Fryer came back again to <hi>Coban</hi> and <hi>Vera Paz,</hi> relating how the barbarians hearing him speake their language, and finding him kind, loving and curteous to them, used him also kindly, fearing (as hee said) that if they should kill him, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> would never let them bee at rest and quiet, untill they had utterly destroyed them. Hee related when he came back, that the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try which the Barbarians inhabite, is better then any part of the <hi>Vera Paz,</hi> which is subject to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and spoke much of a Valley, where is a great lake, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it a Towne of <hi>Indians,</hi> which hee judged to bee of at least twelve thousand In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants, the Cottages lying in a distance one from another. This Fryer hath writ of this Country, and hath gone to <hi>Spain</hi> to the Court to motion the conquering of it, for the profit and commodity that may ensue both to <hi>Guatemala</hi> and <hi>Iucatan,</hi> i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Country of the <hi>Vera Paź,</hi> bee straightned by that heathenish people, yet on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther side it hath free passage unto the Golf, and trade there when the ships doe come, carrying Fowles and what other Provision the Country will afford for the ships, and bringing from thence wines, and other <hi>Spanish</hi> wares unto <hi>Coban.</hi> This Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try is very hilly and craggy, and though there bee some bigge Townes in it, they are not above three or foure that are considerable. The chief commodities, are <hi>Achiotte</hi> which is the best of all the Country belonging to <hi>Guatemala</hi>) and <hi>Cacao,</hi> Cotton Wooll, hony, <hi>Canna fistula,</hi> and <hi>Zarzaparilla,</hi> great store of <hi>Maiz,</hi> but no Wheat, much waxe, plenty of fowles and birds of all coloured feathers, wherewith the <hi>Indians</hi> make some curious works, but not like unto those of <hi>Mechoacan;</hi> here are also abundance of Parrets, Apes and Monkies which breed in the Mountaines. The way from <hi>Gua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temala</hi> to this Country is that which hitherto hath beene spoken of from the Golf, as far as the Town of St. <hi>Luke;</hi> and from thence the way keeps on the hils and moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines which lie on the side of the Valley of <hi>Mixco.</hi> These hils are called <hi>Sacatepeques,</hi> (compounded of <hi>Sacate</hi> and <hi>Tepec,</hi> the latter signifying a hill, and the former, herbe or grasse, and thus joyned, they signifie mountaines of grasse) and among them are these chief Townes, first <hi>Santiago</hi> or St. <hi>Iames,</hi> a Town of five hundred Families, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, <hi>San Pedro</hi> or St. <hi>Peter,</hi> consisting of six hundred families, thirdly, St. <hi>Iuan,</hi> or St. <hi>Iohn</hi> consisting also of at least six hundred Families, and fourthly, <hi>Sto Dominge Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nano,</hi> or St. <hi>Dominic</hi> of <hi>Senaco,</hi> being of three hundred Families. These foure Towns are very rich, and the two last very cold, the two first are warmer; there are about them many Farmes of corn and good Wheat, besides the <hi>Indian Maiz.</hi> These <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians</hi> are somewhat of more courage then those of other Townes, and in my time were like to rise up against the <hi>Spaniards</hi> for their unmercifull tyranny over them. The Churches are exceeding rich; in the Towne of <hi>Santiago,</hi> there was living in my time one <hi>Indian,</hi> who for onely vaine-glory had bestowed the worth of six thousand Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ckates upon that Church, and yet afterwards this wretch was found to bee a Wizard and Idolater. These <hi>Indians</hi> get much mony by letting out great tuffes of feathers, which the <hi>Indians</hi> use in their dances upon the feasts of the Dedication of their towns. For some of the great tuffes may have at least threescore long feathers of divers colours, for every feather hiring they have halfe a Riall, besides what price they set to every feather, if any should chance to be lost. From the Town of St. <hi>Iohn,</hi> which is the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thest the way lies plain and pleasant unto a little village of some twenty Cottages, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led St. <hi>Raymundo</hi> or St. <hi>Raymond,</hi> from whence there is a good dayes journy up and down <hi>Barrancas<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

From this is an ascent or a very craggy and rocky Mountaine, called the Mountaine of <hi>Rabinall,</hi> where are steps cut out in the very Rockes for the mules feet, and slipping on one or the other side, they fall surely downe the rockes, breaking their neckes, and mangling all their limbes and joynts; but this dauger continueth not long nor extendeth above a league and a half, and in the top and worst of this danger, there is the comfort of a goodly Valley, called <hi>El Valle de San Nicholas,</hi> St. <hi>Nicholas</hi> his Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley, from an Estancia called St. <hi>Nicholas</hi> belonging to the Dominicans Cloister of <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ban.</hi> This Valley though it must not compare with that of <hi>Mixco</hi> and <hi>Pinola;</hi> yet next after it, it may well take place for onely three things considerable in it. The first is an <hi>Ingenis</hi> of Sugar, called <hi>San Geronymo,</hi> or St. <hi>Hierome,</hi> belonging unto the Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicans Cloister of <hi>Guatemala,</hi> which indeed goeth beyond that spoken of of-<hi>Amatitlan,</hi> both for abundance of Sugar made there, and sent by mules to <hi>Guatemala</hi> over that rocky Mountaine, and for multitude of slaves living in it under the command of two Fryers, and for the excellent horses bred there, which are incomparably the best of all the Country of <hi>Guatemala</hi> for metle, and gallantry, and therefore (though mules are commonly used for burthens) are much desired and looked after by the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lants and Gentry of the City, who make it a great part of their honour to prance a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the streets. The second thing in this Valley is the Estanci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     <hi>Nicolas</hi> which is as famous for breeding of mules, as is St. <hi>Hierome</hi> for horses. The third or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament to it is a Town of <hi>Indians,</hi> called <hi>Rabinall,</hi> of at least eight hundred Families, which hath all that heart can wish for pleasure and life of man. It inclineth rather to heat then cold, but the heat is moderate and much qualified with the many cool and shady walkes. There is not any <hi>Indian</hi> fruit, which is not there to be found, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:53246:75"/>
the fruits of <hi>Spain,</hi> as Oranges, Lemmons, sweet and sowre, Citrons, Pomegra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates, Grapes, Figs, Almonds, and Dates; the onely want of wheat is not a want to them that mind bread of wheat more then of Maiz, for in two dayes it is easily brought from the Townes of <hi>Sacatepeques.</hi> For flesh, it hath Beef, Mutton, Kid, Fowles, Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kies, Quailes, Partridges, Rabbets, Pheasants; and for fish, it hath a River running by the houses, which yeeldeth plenty both great and small. The <hi>Indians</hi> of this Towne are much like unto those of <hi>Chiapa</hi> of the <hi>Indians,</hi> for bravery, for feasting, for riding of horses, and shewing themselves in sports and pastimes. This Town my friend Fryer <hi>Iohn Baptist,</hi> after hee had been Prior of many places, and especially of <hi>Chiapa</hi> and <hi>Guatemala,</hi> chose to live in to injoy quietnesse, pleasure and content; and in this Town was I feasted by him in such a sumptuous, prodigall and lavishing way, as truely might make poor mendicant Fryers ashamed to come so neer unto Princes in vanity of life and dyet. From this Valley unto the <hi>Vera Paz,</hi> or <hi>Coban,</hi> the head Town of it, there is nothing considerable, save onely one Town more called St. <hi>Christoval</hi> or St. <hi>Christopher,</hi> which enjoyeth now a pleasant Lake, and bottomelesse, as is reported. Formerly there being no Lake at all, in a great Earthquake, the earth there opened, and swallowed up many houses, leaving this Lake which ever since hath continued. From hence to <hi>Coban</hi> the wayes are bad and mountainous, yet such as through the worst of them, those coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try mules with heavy burthens easily goe through. And thus with my pen, Reader, have I gone through most of the bounds and limits of <hi>Guatemala,</hi> which is more furnished with gallant Towns of <hi>Indians,</hi> then is any part of all <hi>America;</hi> and doubtlesse were the <hi>Indians</hi> warlike, industrious, active for warre or weapons, no part in all <hi>America</hi> might bee stronger in people then <hi>Guatemala.</hi> But they being kept under and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed by the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and no weapons allowed them, not so much as their natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Bowes and Arrowes, much lesse Guns, Pistols, Muskets, Swords, or Pikes, their courage is gone, their affections alienated from the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and so the <hi>Spaniards</hi> might very well feare, that if their country should be invaded, the multitude of their <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian</hi> people, would prove to them a multitude of enemies, either running away to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther side; or forced to help, would bee to them but as the help of so many flies.</p>

unarmed people; so may any other nation, that shall be incouraged to invade that land, be secure also from the <hi>Indians,</hi> &amp; consequently the <hi>Spaniards</hi> own policy for themselves against the <hi>Indians</hi> may be their greatest ruine, and destruction, being a great people and yet no people; for the abundance of their <hi>Indians</hi> would be to them as no people; and they themselves, (who out of their few Towns and Cities live but here and there, too thinly scattered upon so great and capacious a land) would be but a handfull for any reasonable Army; and of that handfull very few would be found able or fitting men; and those able men would do little without the help of guns and ordnance; and if their own oppressed people, <hi>Black-mores</hi> and <hi>Indians</hi> (which themselves have alwaies feared) should side against them, soon would they be swallowed up both from within and from with out. And by this it may easily appear how ungrounded they are, who say, it is har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to conquer <hi>America</hi> now then in <hi>Cortez</hi> his time, for that there are now both <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi> and <hi>Indians</hi> to fight against, and then there were none but bare and naked <hi>Indians.</hi> This I say is a false ground; for then there were <hi>Indians</hi> trained up in wars one against another, who knew wel to use their bows and arrows, and darts, and other weapons, and were desperate in their fights and single combats, as may appear out of the histories of them; but now they are cowardized, oppressed, unarmed, soon frighted with the noise of a musket, nay with a sowre and grim look of a <hi>Spaniard,</hi> so from them there is no fear; neither can there be from the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who from al the vast dominions of <hi>Gua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temala</hi> are not able to raise five thousand able fighting men, nor to de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>The miserable condition of the <hi>Indians</hi> of that Country is such, that though the Kings of <hi>Spain</hi> have never yeelded to what some would have, that they should be slaves, yet their lives are as full of bitternesse as is the life of a slave. For which I have known my selfe some of them that have come home from toyling and moyling with <hi>Spaniards,</hi> after many blowes, some wounds, and little or no wages, who have sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenly and stubbornly lain down upon their beds, resolving to die rather then to live any longer a life so slavish, and have refused to take either meat or drinke, or any thing else comfortable and nourishing, which their wives have offered unto them, that so by pining and starving they might consume themselves. Some I have by good perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions encouraged to life rather then to a voluntary and wilfull death; others there have been that would not be perswaded, but in that wilfull way have died. The <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi> that live about that Country (especially the farmers of the valley of <hi>Mixco, Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nola, Petapa, Amatitlan,</hi> and those of the <hi>Sacatepeques</hi>) alleadge that all their trading<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and farming, is for the good of the Common-wealth, and therefore whereas there are not <hi>Spaniards</hi> enough for so ample and large a Countrey to doe all their work, and all are not able to buy slaves and <hi>Blackmores,</hi> they stand in need of the <hi>Indians</hi> help to serve them for their pay and hire; whereupon it hath been considered, that a partiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Indian</hi> labourers be made every Monday, or Sonday in the afternoon to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> according to the farmes they occupie, or acording to their severall employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, calling, and trading with Mules, or any other way. So that for such and such a district there is named an officer, who is called Juez Repartidor, who according to a List made of every farme, house, and person, is to give so many <hi>Indians</hi> by the week. And here is a doore opened to the president of <hi>Guatemala,</hi> and to the Judges to provide well for their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

They name the Town and place of their meeting upon Sonday or Monday, to the which themselves and the <hi>Spaniards</hi> of that district do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sort.

puddings of frixoles, or <hi>French</hi> beanes, and a little Chile or biting long pepper, or a bit of cold meat for the first day or two) and with beds on their backes (which is only a course woollen mantle to wrap about them when they lye on the bare ground) then are they shut up in the Towne-house, some with blowes, some with spurnings, some with boxes on the eare, if presently they goe not in. Now all being gathered together, and the house filled with them, the Juez Repartidor or officer, calls by the order of the List such and such a <hi>Spaniard,</hi> and also calls out of the house so many <hi>Indians</hi> as by the Court are commanded to be given him (some are allowed three, some foure, some ten, some fifteen, some twenty, according to their employments) and delivereth unto the <hi>Spaniard</hi> his <hi>Indians,</hi> and so to all the rest, till they be all ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; who when they receive their <hi>Indians,</hi> take from them a toole, or their mantles; to secure them that they run not away; and for every <hi>Indian</hi> delivered unto them, they give unto the Juez Repartidor or officer, halfe a Riall, which is three pence an <hi>Indian</hi> for his fees, which mounteth yeerly to him to a great deale of money; for some officers make a partition or distribution of four hundred, some of two hundred, some of three hundred <hi>Indians,</hi> every week, and carrieth home with him so many halfe hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Rials for one, or halfe a daies worke. If complaint be made by any <hi>Spaniard</hi> that such and such an <hi>Indian</hi> did run away from him, and served him not the week past, the <hi>Indian</hi> must be brought, and surely tied to a post by his hands in the Market place, and there be whipped upon his bare backe. But if the poor <hi>Indian</hi> complaine that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> cousened and cheated him of his shovell, axe, bill, mantle, or wages, no justice shall be executed against the cheating <hi>Spaniard,</hi> neither shall the <hi>Indian</hi> be righted, though it is true the order runs equally in favour of both <hi>Indian</hi> and <hi>Spaniard.</hi> Thus are the poore <hi>Indians</hi> sold for three pence a peece for a whole weeks slavery, not permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to goe home at nights unto their wives, though their worke lie not above a mile from the Town where they live; nay some are carried ten or twelve miles from their home, who must not returne till Saturday night late, and must that week do whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever their Master pleaseth to command them. The wages appointed them will scarce find them meat and drinke, for they are not allowed a Riall a day, which is but six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, and with that they are to find themselves, but for six daies worke and diet they are to have five Rials, which is halfe a crowne. This same order is observed in the City of <hi>Guatemala,</hi> and Townes of <hi>Spaniards,</hi> where to every family that wants the service of an <hi>Indian</hi> or <hi>Indians,</hi> though it be but to fetch water and wood on their backs, or to goe of arrants, is allowed the like service from the neerest <hi>Indian</hi> Townes. It would grieve a Christians heart to see how by some cruell <hi>Spaniards</hi> in that weeks ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, those poor wretches are wronged and abused; some visiting their wives at home, whilst their poore husbands are digging and delving; others whipping them for their slow working, others wounding them with their swords, or breaking their heads for some reasonable and well grounded answer in their own behalfe, others stealing from them their tooles, others cheating them of halfe, others of all their wages, alleadg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that their service cost them halfe a Riall, and yet their worke not well performed. I knew some who made a common practice of this, when their wheat was sowne, and they had little to do for the <hi>Indians;</hi> yet they would have home as many as were due unto their farme, and on Monday and Tuesday would make them cut and bring them on their backes as much wood as they needed all that week, and then on Wednesday at noon (knowing the great desire of the <hi>Indians</hi> to goe home to their wives, for the which they would give any thing) would say unto them, What will you give me now, if I let you goe home to doe your own worke? whereunto the <hi>Indians</hi> would joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully reply and answer, some that they would give a Riall, others two Rials, which they would take and send them home, and so would have much worke done, wood to serve their house a week, and mony as much as would buy them meat, and Cacao for Chocolatte two weeks together; and thus from the poor <hi>Indians</hi> doe those uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scionable <hi>Spaniards</hi> practice a cheap and lazy way of living. Others will sell them away for that week unto a neighbour that hath present need of worke, demanding Rials a piece for every <hi>Indian,</hi> which he that buyeth them, will be sure to defray out of their wages. So likewise are they in a slavish bondage and readinesse for all passen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers and travellers, who in any Towne may demand unto the next Towne as many <hi>Indians</hi> do goe with his Mules, or to carry on their backes a heavy burthen as he shall need, who at the journeys end will pick some quarrell with them, and so send them
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:53246:76"/>
back with blowes and stripes without any pay at all. A Petaca, or leatherne Trunke, and chest of above a hundred weight, they will make those wretches to carry on their backs a whole day, nay some two or three daies together, which they doe by tying the chest on each side with ropes, having a broad leather in the middle, which they crosse over the forepart of their head, or over their forehead, hanging thus the waitgh upon their heads and browes, which at their journeys end hath made the blood stick in the foreheads of some, galling and pulling off the skin, and marking them in the fore-top of their heads, who as they are called <hi>Tamemez<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> so are easily known in a Towne by their baldnesse, that leather girt having worn off all their hair. With these hard u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages, yet do those poor people make a shift to live amonst the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> but so that with anguish of heart they are still crying out to God for justice, and for liberty, whose only comfort is in their Preists and Friers, who many times doe quiet them when they would rise up in mutiny, and for their owne ends doe often prevaile over them with fair and cunning perswasions, to bear and suffer for Gods sake, and for the good of the Common-wealth that hard task and service which is laid upon them. And though in in all seasons, wet and dry, cold and hot, and in all wayes plain and mountainous, green and dirty, dusty and stony, they must performe this hard service to their commanding Masters, their apparell and cloathing is but such as may cover the nakednesse of their body, nay in some it is such torne rags as will not cover halfe their nakednesse. Their ordinary cloathing is a paire of linnen or woollen drawers broad and open at the knees, without shooes (though in their journeys some will put on leatherne sandals to keep the soles of their feet) or stockins, without any doublet, a short course shirt, which reacheth a little below their waste, and serves more for a doublet then for a shirt, and for a cloake a woollen or linnen mantle, (called Aiate) tied with a knot over one shoulder, hanging down on the other side almost to the ground, with a twelve pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny or two shilling hat, with after one good shower of raine like paper falls about their necks and eies; their bed they carry sometimes about them, which is that woollen mantle wherewith they wrap themselves about at night, taking off their shirt and drawers, which they lay under their head for a pillow; some will carry with them a short, slight, and light Mat to lie, but those that carry it not with them, if they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not borrow one of a neighbour, lie as willingly in their mantle upon the bare ground, as a Gentleman in <hi>England</hi> upon a soft down-bed, and thus do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Those that are of the better sort, and richer, and who are not employed as <hi>Tamemez</hi> to carry burthens, or as Labourers to work for <hi>Spaniards,</hi> but keep at home following their own farmes, or following their owne Mules about the Country, or following their trades and callings in their shops, or governing the Townes, as Alcaldes, or Alguaziles, officers of justice, may goe a little better appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relled, but after the same manner.

When they goe to Church or abroad, they put upon their heads a vaile of linnen, which hangeth almost to the ground, and this is that which costs them most of all their attire, for that commonly it is of <hi>Holland</hi> or some good linnen brought from <hi>Spain,</hi> or fine linnen brought from <hi>China,</hi> which the better sort wear with a lace about. When they are at home at work they commonly take off their Guaipil, or surplice, discovering the nakednesse of their breasts and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. They lie also in their beds as doe their husbands, wrapped up only with a mantle, or with a blanket. Their houses are but poore thatched cottages, without any upper roomes, but commonly one or two only roomes below, in the one they dresse their meat in the middle of it, making a compasse for fire, with two or three stones, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any other chimney to convey the smoak away, which spreading it selfe about the the roome filleth the thatch and the rafters so with sur, that all the roome seemeth to be a chimney. The next unto it, is not free from smoak and blacknesse, where some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times are four or five beds according to the family. The poorer sort have but one room, where they eat, dresse their meat, and sleep. Few there are that set any lockes upon their dores, for they fear no robbing nor stealing, neither have they in their houses much to lose, earthen pots, and pans, and dishes, and cups to drinke their Choco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latte, being the chief commodities in their house. There is scarce any house which hath not also in the yard a stew, wherein they bath themselves with hot water, which is their chief physick when they feel themselves distempered. Among themselves they are in every Town divided into Tribes, which have one chief head, to whom all that belong unto that Tribe, doe resort in any difficult matters, who is bound to aid, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect, defend, counsell, and appear for the rest of his Tribe before the officers of justice in any wrong that is like to be done unto them. When any is to be married, the father of the son that is to take a wife out of another Tribe, goeth unto the head of his Tribe to give him warning of his sons marriage with such a maid. Then that head meets with the head of the maids Tribe, and they conferre about it. The businesse commonly is in debate a quarter of a yeer; all which time the parents of the youth or man are with gifts to buy the maid; they are to be at the charges of all that is spent in eating and drinking, when the heads of the two Tribes doe meet with the rest of the kindred of each side, who sometimes fit in conference a whole day, or most part of a night. After many dayes and nights thus spent, and a full triall being made of the the one and other sides affection, if they chance to disagree about the marriage, then is the Tribe and parents of the maid to restore back all that the other side hath spent and given. They give no portions with their daughters, but when they die, their goods and lands are equally divided among their sons. If any one want a house to live in, or will repair and thatch his house anew, notice is given to the heads of the Tribes, who warn all the Town to come to help in the work, and every one is to bring a bundle of straw, and other materials, so that in one day with the helpe of many they finish a house, without any charges more then of Chocolatte, which they minister in great cups as big as will hold above a pint, not putting in any costly materials, as doe the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> but only a little Anniseed, and Chile, or <hi>Indian</hi> pepper; or else they halfe fill the cup wich Attolle, and powre upon it as much Chocolatte as will fill the cup and colour it. In their diet the poorer sort are limited many times to a dish of Frixoles, or Turkey beanes, either black or white (which are there in very great abundance, and are kept dry for all the yeer) boyled with Chile; and if they can have this, they hold them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves well satisfied; with these beanes, they make also dumplins, first boyling the bean a little, and then mingling it with a masse of Maiz, as we do mingle Currants in our cakes, and so boile again the frixoles with the dumplin of Maiz masse, and so eat it hot, or keep it cold; but this and all whatsoever else they eat, they either eat it with green biting Chile, or else they dip it in water and salt, wherein is bruised some of that Chile. But if their means will not reach to frixoles, their ordinary fare and diet is, their Tortilla's (so they call thin round cakes made of the dow and masse of Maiz) which they eat hot from an earthen pan, whereon they are soon baked with one tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning over the fire; and these they eat alone either with Chile and salt, and dipping them in water and salt with a little bruised Chile. When their Maiz is green and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, they boil some of those whole stalkes or clusters, whereon the Maiz groweth with the leaf about, and so casting a little salt about it, they eat it. I have often eate of this, and found it as dainty as our young green pease, and very nourishing, but it much
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:53246:77"/>
increaseth the blood. Also of this green and tender Maiz they make a Furmity, boiling the Maiz in some of the milke which they have first taken out of it by bruising it. The poorest <hi>Indian</hi> never wants this diet, and is well satisfied, as long as his belly is tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly filled. But the poorest that live in such Townes where flesh meat is sold, will make a hard shift, but that when they come from worke on Saturday night, they will buy one halfe Riall, or a Riall worth of fresh meat to eat on the Lords day. Some will buy a good deal at once, and keep it long by dressing it into Tassajo's, which are bun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Then they take the flesh and salt it, (which being sliced and thinly cut, soon takes salt) and hang it up in their yards like a line from post to post, or from tree to tree, to the wind for a whole week, and then they hang it in the smoak another week, and after rowle it up in small bundles, which become as hard as a stone, and so as they need it, they wash it, boyl it and eat it. This is <hi>America's</hi> powdered beef, which they call Tassajo, whereof I have often eaten, and the <hi>Spaniards</hi> eat much of it, especially those that trade about the Countrey with Mules; nay this Tassajo is a great commodity, and hath made many a <hi>Spaniard</hi> rich, who carry a Mule or two loaden with these Tassajo's in small parcels and bundles to those Townes were is no flesh at all sold, and there they exchange them for other commodities among the <hi>Indians,</hi> receiving peradventure for one Tassajo or bundle, (which cost them but the halfe part of a farthing) as much Cacao, as in other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces they sell for a Riall or six pence. The richer sort of people will fare better, for if there be fish or flesh to bee had, they will have it, and eat most greedily of it; and will not spare their fowls and Turkeys from their own bellies. These also will now and then get a wild Dear, shooting it with their bows and arrows. And when they have killed it, they let it lie in the woodin in some hole or bottom covered with leaves for the space of about a week, untill it stinke and begin to be full of wormes; then they bring it home, cut it out into joynts, and parboil it with an herbe which groweth there somewhat like unto our Tanzy, which they say sweetneth it again, and maketh the flesh eat ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and as white at a peice of Turkey. Thus parboiled, they hang up the joynts in the smoke for a while, and then boyle it again, when they eat it, which is commonly dressed with red <hi>Indian</hi> pepper; and this is the Venison of <hi>

These <hi>Indians</hi> that have little to doe at home, and are not employed in the weekly service under the <hi>Spaniards</hi> in their hunting, will looke seriously for Hedge hogs, which are just like un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ours, though certainly ours are not meat for any Christian. They are full of pricks and brisles like ours, and are found in woods and fields, living in holes, and as they say feed upon nothing but Amits and their egs, and upon dry rotten sticks, herbes, and roots; of these they eat much, the flesh being as white and sweet as a Rabbit, and as fat as is a <hi>Ianuary</hi> hen kept up and fatted in a Coope. Of this meat I have also ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, and confesse it is a dainty dish there, though I will not say the same of a Hedge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hog here; for what here may be poyson, there may be good and lawfull meate, by some accidentall difference in the creature it selfe, and in that which it feeds upon, or in the temper of the air and climate. This meat not only the <hi>Indians</hi> but the best of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> feed on it; and it is so much esteemed of, that because in Lent they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly found, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> will not be deprived of it, but do eat it also then, alleadg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging that it is no flesh (though in the eating it be in fatnesse and in taste, and in all like unto flesh) for that it feeds not upon any thing that is very nourishing, but chiefly upon Amits egs, and dry sticks. It is a great point of controversie amongst their Divines, some hold it lawfull, others unlawfull for that time; it seems the pricks and brisles of the <hi>Indian</hi> Hedge-hog prick their consciences with a foolish seruple.

They are longer then a Rabbit, and like unto a Scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion, with some green, some black scales on their backes. Those upon the land will run very fast, like Lizards, and will climbe up trees like Squerrils, and breed in the roots of trees or in stone walls. The fight of them is enough to affright one; and yet when they are dressed and stewed in broth with a little spice, they make a dainty
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:53246:78"/>
broth, and eat also as white as a Rabbit, nay the middle bone is made just like the backe bone of a Rabbit. They are dangerous meat, if not throughly boiled, and they had almost cost mee my life for eating too much of them, not being stewed enough. There are also many water and land Tortoi's, which the <hi>Indians</hi> find out for themselves, and also relish exceeding well unto the <hi>Spaniards</hi> palate. As for drinking, the <hi>Indians</hi> generally are much given unto it; and drinke if they have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else, of their poore and simple Chocolatte, without Sugar or many compounds, or of Atolle, untill their bellies bee ready to burst. But if they can get any drink that will make them mad drunk, they will not give it over as long as a drop is left, or a penny remaines in their purse to purchase it. Among themselves they use to make such drinks as are in operation far stronger then wine; and these they confection in such great Jarres as come from <hi>Spain;</hi> wherein they put some little quantity of water, and fill up the Jar with some Melasso's, or juyee of the Sugar Cane, or some hony for to sweeten it; then for the strengthning of it, they put roots and leaves of Tobacco, with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther kinde of roots which grow there, and they know to bee strong in operation, nay in some places I have known where they have put in a live Toad, and so closed up the Jarre for a fortnight, or moneths space, till all that they have put in him, be throughly steeped and the toad consumed, and the drink well strengthned, then they open it, and call their friends to the drinking of it, (which commonly they doe in the night time, lest their Preist in the Towne should have notice of them in the day) which they never leave off, untill they bee mad, and raging drunke. This drink they call Chicha, which stinketh most filthily, and certainly is the cause of many <hi>Indians</hi> death, especially where they use the toads poyson with it. Once I was informed living in <hi>Mixco,</hi> of a great meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that was appointed in an <hi>Indians</hi> house; and I took with mee the Officers of Justice of the Town, to search that <hi>Indians</hi> house, where I found foure Jarres of <hi>Chicha</hi> not yet opened, I caused them to be taken out, and broken in the street before his doore, and the filthy Chicha to be poured out, which left such a stinking sent in my nostrils, that with the smell of it, or apprehension of its loath somenesse, I fell to vomiting, and continued sick almost a whole week after.</p>
               <p>Now the <hi>Spaniards</hi> knowing this inclination of the <hi>Indians</hi> unto drunkennesse, doe herein much abuse and wrong them; though true it is, there is a strict order, even to the forfeiting of the wine of any one who shall presume to sell wine in a Towne of <hi>Indians,</hi> with a mony mulct besides. Yet for all this the baser and poorer sort of <hi>Spaniards</hi> for their lucre and gaine contemning authority, will goe out from <hi>Guate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mala,</hi> to the Towns of <hi>Indians</hi> about, and carry such wine to sell and inebriate the Natives as may bee very advantagious to themselves; for of one Jarre of wine, they will make two at least, confectioning it with hony and water, and other strong drugs which are cheap to them, and strongly operative upon the poore and weak <hi>Indians</hi> heads, and this they will sell for currant <hi>Spanish</hi> wine, with such pint and quart mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, as never were allowed by Justice Order, but by themselves invented. With such wine they soone intoxicate the poore <hi>Indians,</hi> and when they have made them drunk, then they will cheat them more, making them pay double for their quart measure; and when they see they can drinke no more, then they will cause them to ly down and sleep, and in the meane while will pick their pockets. This is a common sinne among those <hi>Spaniards</hi> of <hi>Guatemala,</hi> and much practised in the City upon the <hi>Indians,</hi> when they come thither to buy or sell. Those that keep the Bodegones (so are called the houses that sell wine, which are no better then a Chandlers shop, for besides wine they sell Candles, Fish, Salt, Cheese and Bacon) will commonly intice in the <hi>Indians,</hi> and make them drunk, and then pick their pockets, and turne them out of doores with blowes and stripes, if they will not fairly depart. There was in <hi>Guatemala</hi> in my time one of these Bodegoner<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

No <hi>Indian</hi> should passe by his doore, but he would call him in, and play upon him as aforesaid. In my time a <hi>Spanish</hi> Farmer, neighbour of mine in the Valley of <hi>Mixco,</hi> chanced to send to <hi>Guatemala</hi> his <hi>Indian</hi> servants with half a dozen mules loaden with wheat to a Merchant, with whom hee had agreed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore for the price, and ordered the money to bee sent unto him by his servant (whom hee had kept six yeers, and ever found him trusty) the wheat being delivered, and the money received (the which mounted to ten pound, sixteen shillings, every mule car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying

six bushels, at twelve Rials a bushel, as was then the price) the <hi>Indian</hi> with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Mate of his walking along the streets to buy some small commodities, passed by <hi>Iohn Ramos</hi> his shop, or Bodegon, who enticing him and his Mate in, soone tripped up their heals with a little confectioned wine for that purpose, and tooke away all his mony from the intrusted <hi>Indian,</hi> and beat them out of his house; who thus drunk being forced to ride home, the <hi>Indian</hi> that had received the money, fell from his mule, and broke his neck; the other got home without his Mate, or money. The Farmer pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuted <hi>Iohn Ramos</hi> in the Court for his money, but <hi>Ramos</hi> being rich and abler to bribe, then the Farmer, got off very well, and so had done formerly in almost the like cases. These are but peccadillo's among those <hi>Spaniards,</hi> to make drunke, rob, and occasion the poor <hi>Indians</hi> death; whose death with them is no more regarded nor vindicated, then the death of a sheep or bullock, that falls into a pit. And thus having spoken of apparrell, houses, eating and drinking, it remaines that I say somewhat of their civility, and Religion of those who lived under the Government of the <hi>Spaniards.</hi> From the <hi>Spaniards</hi> they have borrowed their Civill Government, and in all Townes they have one, or two <hi>Alcaldes,</hi> with more or lesse <hi>Regidores,</hi> (who are as Aldermen or Jurates a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst us) and some <hi>Alguaziles,</hi> more or lesse, who are as Constables, to execute the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the <hi>Alcalde,</hi> (who is a Maior) with his Brethren. In Towns of three or four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Families, or upwards, there are commonly two Alcaldes, six Regidores, two Algua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ziles Maiors, and six under, or petty Alguaziles.

These are changed every yeer by new election, and are chosen by the <hi>Indians</hi> themselves, who take their turnes by the tribes or kindreds, whereby they are divided. Their offices begin on New-Yeers day, and after that day their election is carryed to the City of <hi>Guatemala</hi> (if in that district it bee made) or else to the heads of Justice, or <hi>Spanish</hi> Governours of the severall Provinces, who confirm the new Election, and take account of the last yeers expences made by the other Officers, who carry with them their Town-Book of accounts; and therefore for this purpose every Town hath a Clerk, or Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vener, called Escrivano, who commonly continueth many yeers in his office, by reason of the paucity and unfitnesse of <hi>Indian</hi> Scriveners, who are able to beare such a charge. This Clerk hath many fees for his writings and informations, and accounts, as have the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> though not so much money or bribes, but a small matter, according to the poverty of the <hi>Indians.</hi> The Governour is also commouly continued many yeers, being some chief man among the <hi>Indians,</hi> except for his misdemeanours hee bee complained of, or the <hi>Indians</hi> in generall doe all stomack him.</p>
               <p>Thus they being setled in a civill way of government, they may execute justice up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all such <hi>Indians</hi> of their Town as doe notoriously and scandalously offend. They may imprison, fine, whip, and banish, but hang and quarter they may not; but must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit such cases to the <hi>Spanish</hi> Governour. So likewise if a <hi>Spaniard</hi> passing by the Town, or living in it, doe trouble the peace, and misdemean himself, they may lay hold on him, and send him to the next <hi>Spanish</hi> Justice, with a full information of his offence, but fine him, or keep him about one night in prison they may not. This order they have against <hi>Spaniards,</hi> but they dare not execute it, for a whole Town standeth in awe of one <hi>Spaniard,</hi> and though hee never so hainously offend, and bee unruly, with oathes, threatnings, and drawing of his sword, hee maketh them quake and tremble, and not presume to touch him; for they know if they doe, they shall have the worst, either by blowes, or by some mis-information, which hee will give against them. And this hath been very often tried, for where <hi>Indians</hi> have by virtue of their order in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to curbe an unruly <hi>Spaniard</hi> in their Town, some of them have been woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, others beaten, and when they have carried the <hi>Spaniard</hi> before a <hi>Spanish</hi> Justice and Governour, hee hath pleaded for what hee hath done, saying it was in his owne defence, or for his King and Soveraign, and that the <hi>Indians</hi> would have killed him, and began to mutiny all together against the <hi>Spanish</hi> Authority, and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, denying to serve him with what hee needed for his way and journey; that they would not bee slaves to give him or any <hi>Spaniard</hi> any attendance; and that they would make an end of him, and of all the <hi>Spaniards.</hi> With these and such like false and lying mis-informations, the unruly <hi>Spaniards</hi> have often been beleeved, and too much up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held in their rude and uncivill misdemeanors, and the <hi>Indians</hi> bitterly curbed, and punished, and answer made them in such cases, that if they had been killed for their

Amongst themselves, if any complaint be made against any <hi>Indian,</hi> they dare not meddle with him untill they call all his kindred, and especially the head of that Tribe, to which hee belongeth; who if hee and the rest together, find him to deserve imprisonment, or whipping, or any other punishment, then the Officers of Justice, the Alcaldes or Maiors, and their Brethren the Jurates in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict upon him that punishment; which all shall agree upon. But yet after judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and sentence given, they have another, which is their last appeale, if they please, and that is to their Priest, and Fryer, who liveth in their Town, by whom they will sometimes bee judged, and undergoe what punishment hee shall think fittest. To the Church therefore they often resort in points of Justice, thinking the Preist knoweth more of Law and equity, then themselves; who sometimes reverseth what judgement hath been given in the Town house, blaming the Officers for their partiality and passion against their poore Brother, and setting free the party judged by them; which the Preist does often times, if such an <hi>Indian</hi> doe belong to the Church, or to the service of their house, or have any other relation to them, peradventure for their wives sake, whom either they affect, or imploy in washing, or making their Chocolatte. Such, and their husbands may live lawlesse as long as the Preist is in the Town. And if when the Preist is absent, they call them to triall for any misdemeanor, and whip, fine, or imprison, (which occasion they will sometimes pick out on purpose) when the Preist returnes, they shall bee sure to heare of it, and smart for it, yea, and the Officers themselves peradventure bee whipped in the Church, by the Preists order and appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; against whom they dare not speake, but willingly accept what stripes and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment hee layeth upon them, judging his wisdome, sentence, and punishing hand, the wisdome, sentence and hand of God; whom as they have been taught to be over all Princes, Judges, worldly Officers, so likewise they beleeve, (and have been so taught) that his Preists and Ministers are above theirs, and all worldly power and authority. It happened unto mee living in the Town of <hi>Mixco,</hi> that an <hi>Indian</hi> being judged to bee whipped for some disorders, which hee committed, would not yeeld to the sentence, but apealed to mee, saying hee would have his stripes in the Church, and by my or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, for so hee said his whipping would doe him good, as comming from the hand of God. When hee was brought unto mee, I could not reverse the <hi>Indians</hi> judgment, for it was just, and so caused him to be whipped, which hee tooke very patiently and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily, and after kissed my hands and gave mee an offering of mony for the good hee said, I had done unto his soule. Besides this civility of justice amongst them, they live as in other Civill and Politick and well governed Common-wealths; for in most of their Townes, there are some that professe such trades as are practised among <hi>Spaniards.</hi> There are amongst them Smiths, Taylors, Carpenters, Masons, Shoomakers, and the like.

In the morning hee and the other Musicians at the sound of the Bell, are bound to come to Church to sing and officiate at Masse, which in many Townes they performe with Organs and other musicall Instruments, (as hath beene observed before) as well as <hi>Spaniard<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

This Fiscal is a great man in the Town, and beares more sway then the Majors, Jurates, and other Officers of Justice, and when the Preist is pleased, giveth attendance to him, goeth about his arrants, appointeth such as are to wait on him, when hee rideth out of Town. Both hee and all that doth belong unto the Church, are exempted from the common weekely service of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and from giving attendance to Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers, and from other Officers of Justice. But they are to attend with their Waits, Trumpets, and Musick, upon any great man or Preist that cometh to their Town, and to make Arches with boughes and flowers in the streets for their entertainment. Besides these, those also that doe belong unto the service of the Preists house, are priviledged from the <hi>Spaniards</hi> service. Now the Preist hath change of servants by the week, who take their turnes so, that they may have a weeke or two to spare to doe their work. If it bee a great Town, hee hath three Cookes allowed him, (if a small Town, but two) men Cookes who change their turnes, except hee have any occasion of feasting, then they all come. So likewise hee hath two or three more (whom they call Chahal) as Butlers, who keepe whatsoever Provision is in the house under lock and Key; and give to the Cooke what the Preist appointeth to bee dressed for his dinner, or supper; these keep the Table Clothes, Napkins, Dishes, and Trenchers, and lay the Cloth, and take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and wait at the Table; hee hath besides three or foure, and in great Towns half a dozen of boyes to doe his arrants, wait at the Table, and sleep in the house all the week by their turnes, who with the Cookes and Butlers dine and sup constantly in the Preists house, and at his charges. Hee hath also at dinner and supper times the atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of some old women (who also take their turnes) to oversee half a dozen yong maids, who next to the Priests house doe meet to make him, and his family Tortilla's or Cakes of Maiz, which the boyes doe bring hot to the Table by halfe a dozen at a time. Besides these servants, if hee have a Garden hee is allowed two or three gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deners; and for his stable, at least half a dozen <hi>Indians,</hi> who morning and evening are to bring him Sacate (as there they call it) or herb and grasse for his Mules or Horses, these diet not in the house; but the groome of the stable, who is to come at morning, noone, and Evening, (and therefore are three or foure to change) or at any time that the Preist will ride out; these I say and the Gardners (when they are at work) dine and sup at the Priests charges; who sometimes in great Townes hath above a dozen to feed and provide for. There are besides belonging to the Church priviledged from the weekly attendance upon the <hi>Spaniards</hi> two or three <hi>Indians,</hi> called Sacristanes, who have care of the Vestry and Copes, and Altar Clothes, and every day make ready the Altar or Altars for Masse; also to every Company or Sodality of the Saints, or Virgin, there are two or three, whom they call Mayordomo's, who gather about the Towne Almes for the maintaining of the Sodality; these also gather Egges about the Town for the Preist every week, and give him an account of their gatherings, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him every moneth, or fortnight, two Crownes for a Masse to bee sung to the Saint.</p>
               <p>If there be any fishing place neer the Town, then the Preist also is allowed for to seek him fish three or foure, and in some places half a dozen <hi>Indians,</hi> besides the offerings in the Church, and many other offerings which they bring whensoever they come to speak unto the Preist, or to confesse with him, or for a Saints feast to bee celebrated, and besides their Tithes of every thing, there is a monethly maintenance in money al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed unto the Preist, and brought unto him by the Alcaldes, or Maiors, and Jurates,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:53246:80"/>
which he setteth his hand unto in a book of the Townes expences. This maintenance (though it be allowed by the <hi>Spanish</hi> magistrate, and paid in the Kings name for the preaching of the Gospel) yet it comes out of the poor <hi>Indians</hi> purses and labour, and is either gathered about the Town, or taken out of the Tribute, which they pay un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the King, or from a common plat of ground which with the help of all is sowed and gathered in and sold for that purpose. All the Townes in <hi>America,</hi> which are civilized and under the <hi>Spanish</hi> government, belong either to the Crowne, or to some other Lords, whom they cal Encomendero's, and pay a yeerly tribute unto them. Those that are tenants to their Lords or Encomendero's (who commonly are such as descend from the first conquerors) pay yet unto the King some small tribute in mony, besides what they pay in other kind of commodities unto their owne Encomendero, and in mony also. There is no Town so poor, where every married <hi>Indian</hi> doth not pay at the least in mony four Rials a yeer for tribute to the <hi>King,</hi> besides other <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

And if the Town pay only to the King, they pay at least six, and in some places eight Rials by statute, besides what other commodities are common to the Town or Country where they live, as Maiz, (that is paid in all Townes) hony, Turkeys, fowles, s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

The Mantles of tribute are much esteemed of, for they are choise ones, and of a bigger size, then others, so likewise is the tribute <hi>Cacao, Achiotte, Coehinil,</hi> where it is paid; for the best is set apart for the tribute; and if the <hi>Indians</hi> bring that which is not prime good, they shall surely be lashed, and sent backe for better. The heads of the severall Tribes have care to gather it, and to deliver it to the Alcaldes and Regidores, Maiors and Jurates, who carry it either to the Kings Exche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer in the City, or to the neerest <hi>Spanish</hi> Justice (if it belong to the King) or to the Lord, or Encomendero of the Towne. In nothing I ever perceived the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi> mercifull and indulgent unto the <hi>Indians,</hi> but in this, that if an <hi>Indian</hi> bee very weak, poore, and sickly and not able to work, or threescore and ten yeers of age, he is freed from paying any tribute. There be also some Towns priviledged from this tribute; which are those that can prove themselves to have descended from <hi>Tlax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>callan,</hi> or from certaine Tribes or families of or about <hi>Mexico,</hi> who helped the first <hi>Spaniards</hi> in the conquest of that Country.

Many are given to witchcraft, and are deluded by the devill to beleeve that their life dependeth upon the life of such and such a beast (which they take unto them as their familiar spirit) and think that when that beast dieth they must die; when he is chased, their hearts pant, when he is faint they are faint; nay it happeneth that by the devils delu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

All <hi>Indians</hi> are much affected unto these Popish Saints, but especially those which are given to witchcraft, and out of the smalnesse of their means they will be sure to buy some of these Saints and bring them to the Church, that there they may stand and be worshipped by them and others. The Churches are full of them, and they are placed upon standers gilded or painted, to be carried in procession upon mens shoulders, upon their proper day. And from hence cometh no little profit to the Priests; for upon such Saints daies, the owner of the Saint maketh a great feast in the Towne, and presenteth unto the Preist sometimes two or three, sometimes four or five crownes for his Masse and Sermon, besides a Turkey and three or four fowls, with as much Cacao as will serve to make him Chocolatte for all the whole <hi>Octave</hi> or eight daies following. So that in some Churches, where there are at least fourty of these Saints Statues and Images, they bring unto the Priest at least fourty pounds a yeer. The Preist therefore is very watchfull over those Saints daies, and sendeth warning before hand unto the <hi>Indians</hi> of the day of their Saint, that they may provide themselves for the better celebrating it both at home and in the Church. If they contribute not boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully, then the Preist will chide, and threaten that he will not preach. Some <hi>Indians</hi> through poverty have been unwilling to contribute any thing at all, or to solemnize in the Church and at his house his Saints day, but then the Preist hath threatned to cast his Saints image out of the Church, saying, that the Church ought not to be filled with such Saints as are unprofitable to soul and body, and that in such a statues room one may stand, which may doe more good by occasioning a solemn celebration of one day more in the yeer. So likewise if the <hi>Indian</hi> that owed one of those images die and leave children, they are to take care of that Saint as part of their inheritance, and to provide that his day be kept; but if no son, or heirs be left, then the Preist calleth for the heads of the severall Tribes, and for the chief officers of justice, and maketh a speech unto them, wherein he declareth that part of the Church ground is taken up in vain by such an image, and his stander, without any profit either to the Preist, the Church, or the town, no heir or owner being left alive to proceed for that orphan Saint, to owne it; and that in case they will not seek out who may take charge of him, and of his day, the Preist will not suffer him to stand id<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Friers and Preists, who study nothing more than their own ends, and to enrich them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves from the Church and Altar<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> their policies (who are the wise and prudent chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of this world spoken of in the Gospel) can easily overtop and master the sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity of the poor <hi>Indians;</hi> who rather then they will bring an affront upon their Towne, by suffering any of their Saints to be cast out of their Church, or to be with mony redeemed out of the secular powers hands, will make hast to present unto him an owner of that orphan Saint, who for him shall give to the Preist not only what he may be prized to be worth in a Painters shop for the workmanship, gold and colours belonging to him; but besides shall present him what before hath been observed, for the solemnizing of his feast. These feasts bring yet unto the Saints more profit then hitherto hath been spoken of; for the <hi>Indians</hi> have been taught that upon such daies they ought to offer up somewhat unto the Saints; and therefore they prepare either mony (some a Riall, some two, some more) or else commonly about <hi>Guatemala</hi> white wax-candles, and in other places Cacao, or fruits, which they lay before the image of the Saint, whilst the Masse is celebrating. Some <hi>Indians</hi> will bring a bundle of can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles of a dozen tied together of Rials a peice some, some of three or four for a Riall, and will if they be let alone light them all together and burne them out, so that the Preist at the end of the Masse will find nothing but the ends. Therefore (knowing well of the waies of policy and covetousnesse) he chargeeh the Church officers, whom I said before were called <hi>Mayordomo's</hi> to looke to the offerings, and not to suffer the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians</hi> who bring candles to light more then one before the Saint, and to leave the other before him unlighted (having formerly taught them, that the Saints are as well pleased with their whole candles as with their burnt candles) that so hee may have the more to sell and make mony of. After Masse the Preist and the <hi>Mayordomo's</hi> take and sweep away from the Saint whatsoever they find hath been offered unto him; so that some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in a great Towne upon such a Saints day the Preist may have in mony twelve or twenty Rials, and fifty or a hundred candles, which may be worth unto him twenty or thirty shillings, besides some ends and pieces. Most of the Friers about <hi>Guate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mala</hi> are with these offerings as wel stored with candles, as is any Wax-chandlers shop in the City. And the same candles, which thus they have received by offerings they need not care to sell them away to <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who come about to by them (though some will rather sell them together to such though cheaper, that their mony might come in all at once) for the <hi>Indians</hi> themselves when they want again any candles for the like feast, or for a Christening, and for a womans Churching (at which times they also offer candles) will buy their own againe of the Preist, who sometimes receiveth the same candles and mony for them again five or six times. And because they find that the <hi>Indians</hi> incline very much to this kind of offerings, and that they are so profitable un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, the Friers doe much presse upon the <hi>Indians</hi> in their preaching this point of their Religion, and devotion. But if you demand of these ignorant, but zealous of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferers the <hi>Indians</hi> an account of any point of faith, they will give you little or none. The mystery of the Trinity, and of the incarnation of Christ, and our redemption by him is too hard for them; they will only answer what they have been taught in a Catechisme of questions and answers; but if you ask them if they beleeve such a point of Christianity, they will never answer affirmatively, but only thus, Perhaps it may be so. They are taught there the doctrin of <hi>Rome,</hi> that Christs body is truely and really present in the Sacrament, and no bread in substance, but only the accidents; if the wisest <hi>Indian</hi> be asked, whether he beleeve this, he will answer, Perhaps it may be so. Once an old woman, who was held to be very religious, in the Town of <hi>Mixco,</hi> came to me about receiving the Sacrament, and whilst I was instructing of her, I asked her if she beleeved that Christ body was in the Sacrament, she answered, Peradventure it may be so. A little while after to try her and get her out of this strain and common an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, I asked her what &amp; who was in the Sacrament which she received from the Preists hand at the Altar; she answered nothing for a while, and at last I pressed upon her fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> an affirmative answer; and then she began to looke about to the Saints in the Church, (which was dedicated to a Saint which they call <hi>St. Dominick<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi>) and, as it seemed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing troubled and doubtful what to say, at last she cast her eyes upon the high Altar; but I seeing she delayed the time, asked her again who was in the Sacrament? to which she re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed <hi>S. Dominick</hi> who was the Patron of that Church and Town. At this I smiled, and would yet further try her simplicity with a simple question. I told her she saw <hi>S. Dominick</hi>
                  <pb n="151" facs="tcp:53246:81"/>
was painted with a dog by him holding a torch in his mouth, and the globe of the world at his feet; I asked her, whether all this were with <hi>St. Dominick</hi> in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? To which she answered, Perhaps it might be so; wherewith I began to chide her, and to instruct her. But mine instruction, nor all the teaching and preaching of those <hi>Spanish</hi> Preists hath not yet well grounded them in principles of faith; they are dull and heavie to beleeve or apprehend of God, or of heaven, more then with sense or reason they can conceive. Yet they goe and run that way they see the <hi>Spaniards</hi> run, and as they are taught by their idolatrous Preists. Who have taught them much for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mality, and so they are (as our Formalists formerly in <hi>England</hi>) very formall, but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle substantiall in Religion. They have been taught that when they come to confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, they must offer somewhat to the Preist, and that by their gifts and almes, their sins shall be sooner forgiven; this they doe so formally observe, that, whensoever they come to confession, but especially in Lent, none of them dareth to come with empty hands; some bring mony, some honey, some egs, some fowls, some fish, some Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cao, some one thing, some another, so that the Preist hath a plentifull harvest in Lent for his pains in hearing their Confessions. They have been taught that also when they receive the Communion, they must surely every one give at least a Riall to the Preist, (surely <hi>England</hi> was never taught in <hi>America</hi> to buy the Sacrament with a two pence offering, and yet this custome too much practised and pressed upon the people) which they performe so, that I have known some poor <hi>Indians,</hi> who have for a week or two forborne from coming to the Communion untill they could get a Riall offering. It is to be wondred what the Preists doe get from those poore wretches in great Towns by Confession and Communion Rials in great Townes, where they denie the Sacrament to none that will receive it, (and in some Townes I have knowne a thousand Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicants) and force all above twelve or thirteen yeers of age to come to Confession in the Lent. They are very formall also in observing <hi>Romes</hi> Monday, Thursday, and good-Friday, and then they make their monuments and sepulchres, wherein they set their Sacrament, and watch it all day and night, placing before it a Crucifix on the ground, with two basins on each side to hold the single or double Rials, which every one must offer when he cometh creeping upon his knees, and bare-footed to kisse Christs hands, feet, and side. The candles which for that day and night and next morning are burned at the sepulchre are bought with another Contribution-Riall, which is gathered from house to house from every <hi>Indian</hi> for that purpose. Their Religion is a dear and lick-penny religion for such poor <hi>Indians,</hi> and yet they are car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried along in it formally and perceive it not. They are taught that they must remember the souls in Purgatory, and therefore that they must cast their almes into a chest, which standeth for that purpose in their Churches, whereof the Preist keepeth the key, and openeth it when he wanteth mony, or when he pleaseth. I have often opened some of those chests; and have found in them many single Rials, some halfe pieces of eight, and some whole pieces of eight. And because what is lost and found in the high-waies, must belong to some body, if the true owner be not knowne, they have been taught that such monies or goods belong also to the soules departed; wherefore the <hi>Indians</hi> (surely more for fear or vanities sake that they may be well thought on by the Preist) if they find any thing lost will bestow it upon the soules surer then the <hi>Spaniards</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves (who if they find a purse lost will keep it,) and will bring it either to the Preist or cast it into the chest. An <hi>Indian</hi> of <hi>Mixco</hi> had found a patacon or peece of eight in a high-way, and when he came to Confession, he gave it unto me telling me he durst not keep it, lest the soules should appear unto him, and demand it. So upon the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond day of <hi>November</hi> which they call All soules day, they are extraordinary foolish and superstitious in offering monies, fowles, egs and Maiz, and other commodities for the soules good, but it proves for the profit of the Preist, who after Masse wipes away to his chamber all that which the poore gulled and deluded <hi>Indians</hi> had offered unto those soules, which needed neither mony, food, nor any other provision, and he fills his purse, and pampers his belly with it. A Frier that lived in <hi>Petapa</hi> boasted unto me once that upon their All Soules day, his offerings had been about a hundred Rials, two hundred Chickens and fowls, half a dozen Turkeyes, eight bushels of Maiz, three hundred egs, four sontles of Cacao, (every sontle being four hundred granes) twenty clusters of plantins, above a hundred wax candles, besides some loaves of bread, and other trifles of fruits. All which being summed up according
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:53246:82"/>
to the price of the things there, and with consideration of the coyn of mony there (halfe a Ryall, or three pence being there the least coyn) mounts to above eight pounds of our money, a faire and goodly stipend for a Masse, brave wages for halfe an houres work; a politick ground for that Error of Purgatory, if the dead bring to the living Preist such wealth in one day onely. Christmas day with the rest of those holy daies is no lesse superstitiously observed by these <hi>Indians;</hi> for against that time they frame and set in some corner of their Church a little thatched house like a stall, which they call <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> with a blazing Starre over, pointing it unto the three Sage wise men from the East; within this stall they lay in a Crib, a child made of wood, painted and guilded (who represents Christ new borne unto them) by him stands <hi>Mary</hi> on the one side, and <hi>Ioseph</hi> on the other, and an Asse likewise on the one side and an oxe on the other, made by hands, the three wise men of the East kneel before the Crib offering gold, Frankincense and Myrrhe, the shepheards stand a loof off offering their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try gifts, some a Kid, some a Lambe, some Milk, some Cheese, and Curds, some fruits, the fields are also there represented with flocks of Sheep and Goats; the Angels they hang about the stall some with Vialls, some with Lutes, some with Harps, a goodly mumming and silent stage play, to draw those simple souls to look about, and to delight their senses and fantasies in the Church.</p>
               <p>There is not an <hi>Indian</hi> that cometh to see that supposed <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> (and there is not any in the Town but doth come to see it) who bringeth not either money or somewhat else for his offering. Nay the policy of the Preists hath been such, that (to stirre up the <hi>Indians</hi> with their Saints example) they have taught them to bring their Saints upon all the holy dayes, untill Twelfth day in Procession unto this <hi>Beth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lehem</hi> to offer their gifts, according to the number of the Saints that stand in the Church, some daies there come five, some daies eight, some daies ten, dividing them into such order, that by Twelfth day all may have come and offered, some money, some one thing, some another; The owner of the Saint, hee cometh before the Saint with his friends and kindred (if there bee no sodality or company belonging unto that Saint) and being very well apparelled for that purpose, he bowes himselfe and kneels to the Crib, and then rising takes from the Saint what hee bringeth and leaveth it there, and so departs. But if there be a sodality belonging to the Saint, then the Mayordomo's or chief Officers of that company they come before the Saint, and doe homage, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer as before hath been said. But upon Twelfth day the Alcaldes, Maiors, Jurates, and other Officers of Justice, must offer after the example of the Saints, and the three Wise men of the East (whom the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> teacheth to have been Kings) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they represent the Kings power and authority. And all these daies they have about the Town and in the Church a dance of Shepheards, who at Christmas Eve at midnight begin before this <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> and then they must offer a Sheep amongst them. Others dance clothed like Angels and with wings, and all to draw the people more to see sights in the Church, then to worship God in Spirit and in Truth. Candlemas day is no lesse superstitiously observed; for then the picture of <hi>Mary</hi> comes in procession to the Altar, and offereth up her Candles and Pigeons, or Turtle-Doves unto the Preist, and all the Town must imitate her example, and bring their Candles to be blessed and hallowed; of foure or five, or as many as they bring, one onely shall bee restored back unto them, because they are blessed, all the rest are for the Preist, to whom the <hi>Indians</hi> resort after to buy them, and give more then ordinary, because they are hallowed Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles. At Whitsontide they have another sight, and that is in the Church also, whilst a Hymne is sung of the Holy Ghost, the Preist standing before the Altar with his face turned to the people, they have a device to let fall a Dove from above over his head well dressed with flowers, and for above half an houre, from holes made for that purpose, they drop down flowers about the Preist shewing the gifts of the holy Ghost to him, which example the ignorant and simple <hi>Indians</hi> are willing to imitate, offering also their gifts unto him. Thus all the yeer are those Preists and Fryers deluding the poore peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple for their ends, enriching themselves with their gifts, placing Religion in meer Policy; and thus doth the <hi>Indians</hi> Religion consist more in sights, shewes and forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, then in any true substance. But as sweet meat must have sowre sawce; so this sweetnesse and pleasing delight of shewes in the Church hath its sowre sawce once a yeer (besides the sowrenesse of poverty which followeth to them by giving so many gifts unto the Preist) for, to shew that in their Religion there is some bitterness, &amp; sowrenesse,
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:53246:82"/>
they make the <hi>Indians</hi> whip themselves the weeke before Easter, like the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> which those simples both men and women perform with such cruelty to their owne flesh, that they butcher it, mangle and teare their backs, till some swound, nay some (as I have known) have died under their own whipping, and have selfe murthered themselves, which the Preists regard not, because their death is sure to bring them at least three or foure Crownes for a Masse for their soules, and other offerings of their friends.</p>
               <p>Thus in Religion they are superstitiously led on, and blinded in the observance of what they have been taught for the good and profit of their Preists, then for any good of their soules, not perceiving that their Religion is a Policy to inrich their teachers. But not onely doe the Fryers and Preists live by them and eat the sweat of their browes; but also all the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who not onely with their worke and service (being themselves many given to idlenesse) grow wealthy and rich; but with need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse offices, and authority are still fleecing them, and taking from them that little which they gaine with much hardnesse and severity.</p>
               <p>The President of <hi>Guatemala,</hi> the Judges of that Chancery, the Governours and High Justices of other parts of the Country, that they may advance and inrich their meniall servants, make the poor <hi>Indians</hi> the subject of their bountifulnesse towards such. Some have offices to visit as often as they please their Towns, and to see what every <hi>Indian</hi> hath sowed of Maiz, for the maintenance of his wife and children; Others visit them to see what fowles they keepe for the good and store of the County; others have order to see whether their houses bee decently kept and their beds orderly placed according to their Families; others have power to call them out to mend and repaire the high wayes, and others have Commission to number the Families and Inhabitants of the severall Townes, to see how they increase that their Tribute may not decrease, but still bee raised. And all this, those officers doe never perform but so, that for their pains they must have from every <hi>Indian</hi> an allowance to bear their charges, (which indeed are none at all) for as long as they stay in the Town, they may call for what fowles and provision they please without paying for it. When they come to number the Townes, they call by lift every <hi>Indian</hi> and cause his chiidren, sonnes and daughters to be brought before them, to see if they bee fit to be married; and if they be of growth and age, and bee not married, the fathers are threatned for keeping them unmarried, and as idle lives the Towne without paying tribute; and according to the number of the sonnes and daughters that are marriageable, the fathers tribute is raised and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased, untill they provide husbands and wives for their sons and daughters, who as soone as they are married, are charged with tribute; which that it may increase, they will suffer none above fifteen yeers of age to live unmarried; Nay the set time of age of marriage appointed for the <hi>Indians,</hi> is at fourteen yeers for the man, and thirteene for the woman, alleadging that they are sooner ripe for the fruit of Wedlock, and sooner ripe in knowledge and malice, and strength for worke and service, then are any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther people. Nay sometimes they force them to marry who are scarce twelve and thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene yeeres of age, if they find them well limbed, and strong in body, explicating a point of one of <hi>Romes</hi> Canons, which alloweth fourteene and fifteen yeers, <hi>nisi ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litia suppleat aetatem.</hi> When I my selfe lived in <hi>Pinola,</hi> that Town by order of <hi>Don Iuan de Guzman,</hi> (a great Gentleman of <hi>Guatemala,</hi> to whom it belonged) was numbred, and an increase of tributary <hi>Indians</hi> was added unto it by this meanes. The numbring it lasted a full week, and in that space I was commanded to joyne in marriage neer twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty couple, which, with those that before had been married since the last numbring of it, made up to the Encomendero or Lord of it an increase of about fifty Families. But it was a shame to see how young some were that at that time were forced to marriage, neither could al my striving and reasoning prevail to the contrary, nor the producing of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gister Boo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

In this manner even in the most free act of the will, (which ought to bee in marriage) are those poore <hi>Indians,</hi> forced and made slaves by the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> to supply with tribute the want of their purses, and the meannesse of their Estates. Yet under this yoke and burden they are cheerfull, and much given to feasting, sporting and dancing, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap> they particularly shew in the chief feasts of their Townes, which are kept
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:53246:83"/>
upon that Saints day to whom their Town is dedicated. And certainly this superstition hath continued also in <hi>England</hi> from the Popish times, to keep Faires in many of our Towns upon Saints dayes (which is the intent of the Papists to draw in the people and country by way of commerce and trading one with another, to honor, worship, and pray to that Saint, to whom the Town is dedicated) or else why are our Faires common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly kept upon <hi>Iohn Baptist, Iames, Peter, Matthew, Bartholomew, Holy Rood, Lady</hi> dayes, and the like, and not as well a day or two before, or a day or two after, which would bee as good and fit dayes to buy and sell, as the other? True it is, our Reformation alloweth not the worshipping of Saints, yet that solemne meeting of the people to Fairs and mirth, and sport upon those daies it hath kept and continued, that so the Saints and their dayes may bee and continue still in our remembrance. There is no Town in the <hi>India's</hi> great or small (though it be but of twenty Families) which is not dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated thus unto our Lady or unto some Saint, and the remembrance of that Saint is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in the mindes not onely of them that live in the Towne, but of all that live farre and neere by commercing, trading, sporting, and dancing, offering unto the Saint, and bowing, kneeling, and praying before him. Before this day day cometh, the <hi>Indians</hi> of the Town two or three Moneths have their meetings at night, and prepare themselves for such dances as are most commonly used amongst them; and in these their meetings they drinke much both of Chocolatte and Chicha. For every kind of dance they have severall houses appointed, and masters of that dance, who teach the rest that they may bee perfected in it against the Saints day. For the most part of these two or three moneths the silence of the night is unquieted, what with their singing, what with their hollowing, what with their beating upon the shels of fishes, what with their Waits, and what with their piping. And when the feast cometh, then they act pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely, and for the space of eight dayes, what privately they had practised before. They are that day well apparelled with silkes, fine linnen, ribbands and feathers accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the dance; which first they begin in the Church before the Saint, or in the Church yard, and from thence all the <hi>Octave,</hi> or eight dayes they goe from house to house dancing, where they have Chocolatte or some heady drink or Chicha given them. All those eight daies the Towne is sure to bee full of drunkards; and if they bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended for it; they will answer, that their heart doth rejoyce with their Saint in heaven, and that they must drinke unto him, that hee may remember them. The chief dance used amongst them is called Toncontin, which hath been danced before the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> in the Court of <hi>Madrid</hi> by <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who have lived in the <hi>India's</hi> to shew unto the King somewhat of the <hi>Indians</hi> fashions; and it was reported to have pleased the King very much. This dance is thus performed. The <hi>Indians</hi> commonly that dance it (if it bee a great Towne) are thirty or forty, or fewer, if it be a small Town. They are clothed in white, both their dublets, linnen drawers, and Aiates, or towels, which on the one side hang almost to the ground. Their drawers and Aiates are wrought with some workes of Silk, or with birds, or bordered with some Lace. Others procure dublets and drawers and Aiates of Silk, all which are hired for that purpose. On their backs they hang long tuffes of feathers of all colours, which with glew are fastned into a little frame made for the purpose, and guilded on the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side; this frame with Ribbands they tie about their shoulders fast that it fall not, nor slacken with the motion of their bodies. Upon their heads they wear another lesse tuffe of Feathers either in their hats, or in some guilded or painted head-peece, or hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met. In their hands also they carry a fan of feathers, and on their feet most will use feathers also bound together like short wings of birds; some weare shooes, some not. And thus from top to toe they are almost covered with curious and coloured feathers. Their Musick and tune to this dance is onely what is made with a hollow stock of a tree, being rounded, and well pared within and without, very smooth and shining, some foure times thicker then our viols, with two or three long clefts on the upper side and some holes at the end which they call <hi>Tepanabaz.</hi> On this stock (which is placed upon a stool or fourm in the middle of the <hi>Indians</hi>) the Master of the dance beates with two sticks, covered with wooll at the ends, and a pitched leather over the wooll that it fall not away. With this Instrument and blowes upon it (which soundeth but dull and heavy, but somewhat loud) hee giveth the dancers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> their severall tunes, and changes, and signes of the mothion their bodies either straight or bowing, and giveth them warning what and when they are to fing. Thus they dance in compasse and
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:53246:83"/>
circle round about that instrument, one following another sometimes straight, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times turning about, sometimes turning half way, sometimes bending their bodies and with the feathers in their hands almost touching the ground, and singing the life of that their Saint, or o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>This Toncontin the chief and principall onely of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

They have another dance much used, which is a kind of hunting out some wild Beast (which formerly in time of Heathenisme was to bee sacrificed to their Gods) to bee offered up unto the Saint. This dance hath much variety of tunes, with a small Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panabaz, and many shels of Tortoi's, or in stead of them with pots covered with lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, on which they strike as on Tepanabaz, and with the sound of pipes; in this dance they use much hollowing and noise and calling one unto another, and speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by way of Stage play, some relating one thing, some another concerning the Beast they hunt a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap> and there at the Beasts for his defence, whom at last they catch and make a prey of. As the Toncontin consists most of walking and turning and leasurely bending their bodies, so this dance doth wholly consist in action, running in a cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle round, sometimes out of circle, and leaping and striking with those tooles and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments which they have in their hand. This is a very rude sport, and full of scrieking and hideous noise, wherein I never delighted. Another <hi>Mexican</hi> dance they use, some clothed like men, others like women, which in Heathenish times they did use with singing praises unto their King or Emperour; but now they apply their songs unto the King of Glory, or unto the Sacrament, using these or commonly the like words with very little difference, and some variety of prais<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Besides these they have, and use our Morris dances, and Blackmore dances with Sonajas in their hands, which are a round set of small Morris dancing bells, wherewith they make variety of sounds to their nimble feet. But the dance which doth draw to it the peoples wondering is a Tragedy acted by way of dance, as the death of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> or the beheading of <hi>Iohn</hi> the <hi>Baptist.</hi> In these dances there is an Emperour, or a King <hi>Herod</hi> with their Queens clothed, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cloathed with a long loose Coat who represent<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

The King and Queen sit sometimes down to hear their pleading against the Saint, and his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding for himselfe; and sometimes they dance with the rest; and the end of their dance is to crucifie St. <hi>Peter</hi> downwards with his head upon a Crosse, or behead <hi>Iohn</hi> the <hi>Baptist,</hi> having in readinesse a painted head in a dish, which they present unto the King and Queen, for joy whereof they all again dance merrily and so conclude, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king down him that acted <hi>Peter</hi> from the Crosse.

When I lived amongst them, it was an ordinary thing for him who in the dance was to act St. <hi>Peter</hi> or <hi>Iohn</hi> the <hi>Baptist,</hi> to come first to Confession, saying they must bee holy and pure like that Saint, whom they represent, and must prepare themselves to die.

Hereupon I seeing my self a prisoner, and without hopes for the present of seeing <hi>England</hi> in many yeers, resolved to stay no more in <hi>Guatemala,</hi> but to goe out to learne some <hi>Indian</hi> tongue, and to preach in some of their Townes, where I knew more money might bee got to help mee home, when the time should come, then if I did continue to live in the Cloister of <hi>Guatemala.</hi> Yet in the mean time I thought it not unfit to write to <hi>Spain</hi> to a friend of mine an <hi>English</hi> Fryer in <hi>San Lucar,</hi> called Fryer <hi>Pablo de Londres</hi> to desire him to obtian for mee a License from the Court, and from the Generall of the Order at <hi>Rome,</hi> that I might return unto my Country. In this season there was in <hi>Guatemala,</hi> Fryer <hi>Francisco de Moran,</hi> the Prior of <hi>Coban</hi> in the Province of <hi>Vera Paz,</hi> who was informing the President and whole Chancery, how necessary it was that some <hi>Spaniards</hi> should bee ayding and assisting him for the discovery
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:53246:84"/>
of a way from that Country unto <hi>Iucatan,</hi> and for the suppressing of such barbarous people and Heathens, as stopped his passage, and did often invade some <hi>Indian</hi> Towns of Christians. This <hi>Moran</hi> (being my speciall friend, and having been brought up in <hi>Spaine</hi> in the Cloister of <hi>San Pablo de Valladolid,</hi> where my selfe was first entred Frier,) was very desirous of my company along with him, for the better bringing into Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity those Heathens, and Idolaters, telling me that doubtlesse in a new Countrey new treasure and great riches was like to be found, whereof no small share and porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on should befall him and me for our pains and adventure. I was not hard to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded, being above all desirous to convert to Christianity a people that had never heard of Christ; and so purposed to forsake that honour which I had in the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie, for to make Christ knowne unto that Heathenish people. The Provinciall was glad to see this my courage, and so with some gifts and mony in my purse, sent me with <hi>Moran</hi> to the <hi>Vera Paz</hi> in the company of 50. <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who were appointed by the President to aid and assist us.</p>
               <p>When we came to <hi>Coban</hi> we were well refreshed and provided for a hard and dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous enterprize. From <hi>Coban</hi> we marched to two great Townes of Christians called <hi>St. Peter,</hi> and <hi>St. Iohn,</hi> where were added unto us a hundred <hi>Indians</hi> for our further as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance. From these Towns two daies journey we could travail on Mules safely among Christians and some small villages; but after the two daies we drew neer unto the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens Frontiers, where there was no more open way for Mules, but we must trust unto our feet. We went up and down mountaines amongst woods for the space of two daies, being much discouraged with the thickets and hardnesse of the way, and having no hope of finding out the Heathens. In the night we kept watch and guard for feare of enemies, and resolved yet the third day to goe forward. In the mountaines we found many sorts of fruits and in the bottomes spring<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

These were a testimony unto us of some <hi>Indians</hi> not far off, and therefore made us keep together and be in readinesse, if any assault or onset should be made upon us by the Heathens. Whilst we thus travelled on, we suddenly fell upon halfe a dozen poore cottages, covered with boughes and plantin leaves, and in them wee found three <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian</hi> women, two men and five young children, all naked, who faine would have escaped, but they could not. We refreshed our selves in their poore cottages and gave them of our provision, which at the first they refused to eat, howling and crying and pulling, till <hi>Moran</hi> had better incouraged and comforted them, whose language they partly understood. We clothed them and tooke them along with us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> hoping to make them discover unto us some treasure or some bigger plantation. But that day they were so sullen that we could get nothing out of them. Thus we went on, follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing some tracks which here and there we found of <hi>Indians,</hi> till it was almost evening, and then we did light upon above a dozen cottage<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Here I began with some more of our company to be sick and weary, so that the next day I was not able to goe any further; whereupon we resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to set up our quarters there, and to send out some scouts of <hi>Indians</hi> and <hi>Spaniards</hi> to discover the country, who found further more cottages and plantations of Maiz, of Chile, of Turkey beans, and Cotton-wooll, but no <hi>Indians</hi> at all, for they were all fled. Our scouts returned, and gave us some incouragement from the pleasantnesse of the Country; but withall wished us to be watchfull and carefull, for that certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the flight of those <hi>Indians</hi> was a signe that our coming was noised about the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. The next day we purposed to move forward to that plantation which our scouts had discovered, being (as we were informed) safer and more open to foresee any danger ready to befall us.

forward, about which did inhabit many thousand <hi>Indians,</hi> who were very warlike, and skilfull in their bows and arrows. The one incouraged some, the other much discouraged the rest, who wished themselves out of those woods and unknown places, and began to murmur against <hi>Moran,</hi> who had been the cause of their ingagement in that great danger. Our night was set, and I and the rest of the sick <hi>Spaniards</hi> went to rest, some upon the bare ground, but my self and others in hamacca's, which are of net work tied at two posts or trees, and hanging in the aire, which with the least stirring of the body, rocke one asleep as in a Cradle. Thus I tooke my rest till about midnight; at which time our watches gave an alarm against our approaching enemies, who where thought to be about a thousand. They came desperately towards us, and when they saw they were discovered, and our drums beat up, and our fowling peeces and muskets began to shoot, they hollowed and cried out with a hideous noise, which uproar and suddain affrightment, added sweat and fear to my feaver. But <hi>Moran</hi> (who came to confesse with mee, and to prepare himselfe for death or for some deadly wound) com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted me, wishing me to fear nothing, and to lie still, for that I could doe them no good, and that lesse was my danger then I apprehended, because our Souldiers had compassed me about, so that on no side the Heathens could come in, and flie we could not without the losse of all our lives. The skirmish lasted not above an hour, and then our enemies began to flie back. We tooke ten of them, and in the morning found thirteen dead upon the ground, and of ours five onely were wounded, whereof one died the next day.</p>
               <p>In the morning our Souldiers began to mutiny and to talke of returning back, fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring a worse and more violent onset that day or the night following, for some of the <hi>Indians</hi> who were taken, told them plainly that if they went not away there would come six or seven thousand against them. They told us further, that they knew well that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> had all the country about, except that little portion of theirs, which they desired to enjoy quietly and peaceably, and not to meddle with us, but rather if we would see their countrey and goe through it as friends, they would let us without doing us any hurt; but if we came in a warlike manner to fight and to bring them into slavery, as we had done their neighbours<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they were all resolved to die fighting rather then to yeeld. With these words our Souldiers were divided, some with <hi>Moran</hi> were of opinion to try the <hi>Indians,</hi> and to go peaceably through their Country til they could come to some Towne of <hi>Iucatan;</hi> others were of opinion to fight, others to return back again, considering their weakenesse against so many thousands of <hi>Indians</hi> as were in the Country. But that day nothing was agreed upon, for that we could not stir by reason of the sick and wounded. So we continued there that night, and as the night before much about the same time the enemies came againe upon us, but finding us ready and watching for them, they soone fled. In the morning we resolved to returne back, and <hi>Moran</hi> sent the Heathens word, that if they would let him goe through their country quietly to discover some land of <hi>Iucatan,</hi> he would after a few monthes come peaceably unto them with halfe ad<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

They answered that they would entertaine him, and any few <hi>Indians</hi> well and willingly; all which <hi>Moran</hi> and they performed accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their agreement the next yeer following.</p>
               <p>Thus we returned that day backe the same way that we had come, and I began to find my self better, and my feaver to leave me. We carried with us some of those young chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren which we had taken, to present them unto the President of <hi>Guatemala.</hi> And in <hi>Coban</hi> the Prior <hi>Moran</hi> thought he might first do God good service if he christened those youg children, saying that they might become Saints, and that afterwards their prayers might prevaile with God for the conversion of their parents and of all that country to Christianity. I could not but oppose this his ignorance, which seemed much like unto <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

of beleeving and faithfull parents. So would <hi>Moran</hi> christen these children, though I told him that they ought not to partake of that sacrament and Ordinance of Christ, unlesse they were grounded in articles of Christianity and beleeved, or were children of beleeving parents. But as he had been brought up in errours, whereof that Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is a wide and spatious nest, so he would be obstinate in this point against me and the truth, sprinkling with water those children, and naming them with names of Christians. After this he sent them well apparelled to the resident of <hi>Guatemala,</hi> who commanded them to be kept, and brought up in the Cloister of the Dominican Friers.</p>
               <p>I remained after this for a while in <hi>Coban,</hi> and in the Townes about, untill such time as the ships came to the Gulfe; whither I went with <hi>Moran</hi> to buy wines, oyle, iron, cloth and such things as the Cloister wanted for the present. At which time there being a frigate ready to depart to <hi>Truxillo</hi>) some occasions drawing <hi>Moran</hi> thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) I tooke ship with him. We staied not much above a week in that Port (which is a weak one, as the <hi>English</hi> and <hi>Hollanders</hi> taking of it can witnesse) but presently we thought of returning back to <hi>Guatemala</hi> by land through the countrey of <hi>Comayagua,</hi> commonly called <hi>Honduras.</hi> This is a woody and mountainous countrey, very bad and inconvenient for Travellers, and besides very poore; there the commodities are Hides, <hi>Canna fistula,</hi> and <hi>Zarzaparilla,</hi> and such want of bread, that about <hi>Truxillo</hi> they make use of what they call <hi>Cassave,</hi> which is a dry root, that being eaten dry doth choak, and therefore is soaked in broth, water, wine or Chocolatte, that so it may go down. Within the Countrey, and especially about the City of <hi>Comayagua</hi> (which is a Bishops seat, though a small place of some five hundred inhabitants at the most) there is more store of Maiz by reason of some <hi>Indians,</hi> which are gathered to Townes, few and small. I found this Countrey one of the poorest in all <hi>America.</hi> The chief place in it for health and good living is the valley which is called <hi>Gracias a Dios,</hi> there are some rich farms of Cattle and Wheat; but because it lieth as neer to the Countrey of <hi>Guatemala</hi> as to <hi>Comayagua,</hi> and on this side the waies are better then on that, therefore more of that Wheat is transported to <hi>Guatemala</hi> and to the Townes about it, then to <hi>Comayagua</hi> or <hi>Truxillo.</hi> From <hi>Truxillo</hi> to <hi>Guatemala</hi> there are between fourescore and a hundred leagues, which we travelled by land, not wanting in a barren Countrey neither guides nor provision, for the poore <hi>Indians</hi> thought neither their personall attendance, nor any thing that they enjoyed too good for us.</p>
               <p>Thus we came again to <hi>Guatemala,</hi> and were by the Friers joyfully entertained, and by the President highly rewarded, and by the City called true Apostles, because we had ventured our lives for the discovery of Heathens, and opened a way for their conversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and found out the chief place of their residence, and sent before us those children to the City, who witnessed with being in the Cloister our pains and indeavours. <hi>Moran</hi> was so puffed up with the Presidents favour, and the popular applause, that he resolved in <hi>Guatemala</hi> to venture again his life, and, according to that message which he had sent before to the Heathen <hi>Indians,</hi> to enter amongst them in a peaceable way with halfe a dozen <hi>Indians.</hi> He would fain have had me gone with him; but I considered the hardnesse of the journey, which I thought I should not be able to perform on foot; and also I feared that the <hi>Barbarians</hi> might mutiny against us for those children which we had brought; and lasty I liked not the Countrey, which seemed poore and not for my purpose, to get meanes sufficient to bring me home to <hi>England,</hi> which was the chiefest thought and desire of my heart for the satisfaction of my conscience, which I found still unquiet. Wherefore I resolved to forsake the company of my friend <hi>Moran,</hi> and to desist from new discoveries of Heathens<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and such difficult undertakings, which might endanger my health and life, and at last bring no profit, but only a little vain glory, fame and credit in that Countrey. I thought I might better employ my time, if I learned some <hi>Indian</hi> tongue neerer to <hi>Guatemala,</hi> where I considered the riches of the Townes, the readinesse of the <hi>Indians,</hi> and their willingnesse to further their Preists wants; and lastly, their ignorance in some points of Religion, which I thought I might help and clear with some sound doctrin, and with preaching Christ crucified un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, and bringing them unto that rock of eternall blisse and salvation. I trusted in my friends so much, that I knew it would not be hard for me to take my choice of any place about <hi>Guatemala;</hi> from whence I might facilitate my returne to <hi>England,</hi> and write to <hi>Spain,</hi> and have every yeer an answer easier then any where else<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I opened my

mind unto the Provinciall (who was then at <hi>Guatemala</hi>) and he presently and willingly condescended to my request, and counselled me to learn the <hi>Poconchi</hi> language, (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of I had already got some grounds in the <hi>Vera Paz</hi>) which is most used about <hi>Guate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mala,</hi> and also is much practised in <hi>Vera Paz,</hi> and in the Countrey of <hi>San Salvador.</hi> He promised to send me to the Town of <hi>Petapa,</hi> to learne there the language, with a speciall friend of his named Frier <hi>Peter Molina,</hi> who was very old, and wanted the help and company of some younger person to ease him in the charge that lay upon him, of so great a Towne<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and many Travellers that passed that way. The Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall as if he had knowne my mind, pitched upon my very hearts desire; and thus two weeks before <hi>Midsummer</hi> day I departed from <hi>Guatemala</hi> to <hi>Petapa,</hi> which is six leagues from thence, and there setled my selfe to learn that <hi>Indian</hi> tongue. The Friers of those parts that are any way skilful in the <hi>Indian</hi> languages, have composed Grammars &amp; Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctionaries for the better furthering of others who may supply their places after their decease; but whilst they live are unwilling to teach the languages unto others, lest their schollers should after a good and well grounded knowledge of the tongues, supplant their own Masters, and be means of taking from them that great profit which they have by living as Curates in the <hi>Indian</hi> Townes. Yet this old <hi>Molina</hi> considering him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe in yeers, and for his good friends sake the Provinciall, was not unwilling to accept of my company, and to impart unto me what knowledge he had got by many yeers practice of the <hi>Poconchi</hi> tongue. He gave me therefore a short abstract of all the rudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments belonging unto it, which did consist chiefely of declining Nounes, and conjuga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Verbs, (which I easily learned in the first fortnight that I had been with him) and then a Dictionary of <hi>Indian</hi> words, which was all the rest of my study to get with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out book, untill I was able of my selfe to preach unto the <hi>Indians,</hi> which with much easinesse I obtained by discoursing and conferring with them, what with my private study I had learned.</p>
               <p>After the first six weeks <hi>Molina</hi> writ downe for me in the tongue a short exhortation, which he expounded to me, and wished me to learne it without booke, which I prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched publikely upon the feast of <hi>St. Iames.</hi> After this he gave me another short ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation in <hi>Spanish,</hi> to be preached upon the fifteenth of <hi>August,</hi> which he made me translate into the <hi>Indian</hi> tongue, and he corrected in it what he found amisse, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with I was a little more emboldened, and feared not to shew my selfe in publick to the <hi>Indians.</hi> This practice I continued three or four times untill <hi>Michaelmas,</hi> preaching what with his help I had translated out of <hi>Spanish,</hi> untill I was able to talke with the <hi>Indians</hi> alone, and to make mine own Sermons. After <hi>Michaelmas Molina</hi> being not a little vain glorious of what he had done with me, in perfecting me in an unknowne tongue in so short a space, which was very little above one quarter of the yeer, writ un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Provinciall acquainting him of what paines he had taken with me, and of the good successe of his endeavours, assuring him that I was now fit to take a charge of <hi>Indians</hi> upon me, and to preach alone, further desiring him that he would bestow up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me some <hi>Indian</hi> Towne and Benefics, where I might by constant preaching pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice and further that which with so much facility I had learned. The Provinciall (who had alwaies been my friend) needed not spurs to stir him up to shew more and more his love and kindnesse unto me; but immediately sent me order to goe unto the two Townes of <hi>Mixco</hi> and <hi>Pinala,</hi> and to take charge of the <hi>Indians</hi> in them, and to give quarterly an account of what I received thence unto the Cloister of <hi>Guatemala,</hi> unto which all that valley did appertaine.

for what is over and above their expences, they give to their Superiours, and from them they receive every month a jar of wine, of an Arrobe and a halfe, and every yeer a new habit with other clothing. Yet with what I have said I must not excuse the Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of <hi>Guatemala</hi> from liberty, and the enjoyment of wealth and riches; for they also game and sport, and spend, and fill their bags, and where in their accounts and recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings to the Cloisters they might well give up in a yeer five hundred Crownes besides their own expvnces, they give up per adventure three hundred, and usurpe the rest for themselves, and their vain and idle uses; and trade and traffique under hand with Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants against their vow of poverty.</p>
               <p>With this subordination therefore (which I have shewed) unto the Prior and Cloister of <hi>Guatemala,</hi> was I sent to preach unto the <hi>Indians</hi> of <hi>Mixco</hi> and <hi>Pinola,</hi> from whence for my sake was removed an old Frier of almost fourscore yeers of age, and called to his Cloister to rest, who was notable to performe the charge which lay upon him of two Townes, three leagues distant one from another. The setled means for mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance which I enjoyed in these Townes, and the common offerings and duties which I received from the <hi>Indians</hi> was this. In <hi>Mixco</hi> I was allowed every moneth twenty Crownes, and in <hi>Pinola</hi> fifteen, which was punctually payed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by the Alcaldes and Regidores, Maiors and Jurates, before the end of the moneth; for which payment, the Townes sowed a common peece of land with Wheat or Maiz, and kept their book of accounts, wherein they set downe what crops they yeerly received, what monies they tooke in for the sale of their Corne, and in the same booke I was to write downe what every moneth I received from them; which booke at the yeers end they were to present to be examined by some officer appointed thereunto by the Court of <hi>Guatemala.</hi> Besides this monthly allowance, I had from the Sodalities of the soules in Purgatory every week in each Town two Crownes for a Masse; every moneth two Crownes in <hi>Pinola</hi> upon the first sunday of the moneth from the Sodalitie of the Rosary; and in <hi>Mixco</hi> likewise every month from three Sodalities of the Rosary of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> which were there belonging unto the <hi>Indians,</hi> the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and the <hi>Black-mores,</hi> two Crownes a peece. Further from two more Sodalities belonging to the <hi>Vera Cruz,</hi> or the Crosse of Christ, every moneth two Crownes a peece. And in <hi>Mixco</hi> from a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dality of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> belonging to <hi>St. Nicolas de Tolentino,</hi> two Crowns every month. And from a Sodality of <hi>St. Blas</hi> in <hi>Pinola</hi> every moneth two more Crownes; and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally in <hi>Mizco</hi> from a Sodality entituled of <hi>St. Iacinthe</hi> every moneth yet two Crownes; besides some offerings of either mony, fowles, or candles, upon those daies whereon these Masses were sung; all which amounted to threescore and nine Crowns a month, which was surely setled and paid before the end of the moneth. Besides from what I have formerly said of the Saints statues which doe belong unto the Churches, and doe there constantly bring both mony, fowles, candles, and other offerings upon their day, unto the Preist, the y<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>erly revenues which I had in those two Towns will appear not to have been small; for in <hi>Mixco</hi> there were in my time eighteen Saints Images, and twenty in <hi>Pinola;</hi> which brought unto me upon their day four Crowns a peece for Masse and Sermon, and procession, besides fowles, Turkeys and Cacao, and the offerings before the Saints, which commonly might bee worth at least three Crowns upon every Saints day, which yeerly amounted to at least two hundred, three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>score and six Crownes. Besides the Sodalities of the Rosary of the Virgin, (which as I have before said were foure, three in <hi>Mixco,</hi> and one in <hi>Pinola</hi>) upon five severall feasts of the yeer (which are most observed by the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>) brought unto me four Crownes, two for the dayes Masse, and two for a Masse the day fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, which they call the Anniversarie for the dead, who had belonged unto those Sodalities, which besides those daies offerings (which sometimes were more, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times lesse) and the <hi>Indians</hi> presents of fowles and Cacao, made up yeerly fourscore Crowns more. Besides this, the two Sodalities of the <hi>Vera Cruz</hi> upon two feasts of the Crosse; the one upon the fourteenth of <hi>September,</hi> the other upon the third of <hi>May,</hi> brought four Crownes a peece for the Masse of the day, and the Anniversary Masse following, and upon every Friday in Lent two Crownes, which in the whole yeer came to four and fourty Crownes; all which above reckoned, was as a sure rent in those two Townes. But, should I spend time to reckon up what besides did acccidentally fall, would be tedious. The Christmas offerings in both those two Townes, were worth to me when I lived there at least fourty Crownes. Thursday and Friday offerings be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:53246:87"/>
Easter day were about a hundred Crownes; all Soules day offerings commonly worth fourescore Crownes; and Candlemas day offerings commonly forty more. Besides what was offered upon the Feast of each Town by all the Country which came in, which in <hi>Mixco</hi> one yeer was worth unto mee in Candles and money fourescore Crownes, and in <hi>Pinola</hi> (as I reckoned it) fifty more. The Communicants (every one giving a Riall) might make up in both Towns at least a thousand Rials; and the Confessions in Lent at least a thousand more, besides other offerings of Eggs, Hony, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cao, Fowles and Fruits. Every Christening brought two Rials, every Marriage two Crowns, every ones death two Crowns more at least; and some in my time dyed, who would leave ten or twelve Crownes for five or six Masses to bee sung for their soules.</p>
               <p>Thus are those fooles taught that by the Preists singing their soules are delivered from weeping, and from the fire and torments of Purgatory; and thus by singing all the yeer doe those Fryers charme from the poore <hi>Indians</hi> and their Sodalities and Saints an infinite treasure wherewith they inrich themselves and their Cloisters; as may bee gathered from what I have noted by my owne experience in those two Townes of <hi>Mixco</hi> and <hi>Pinola,</hi> (which were farre inferiour yet to <hi>Petapa</hi> and <hi>Amatitlan</hi> in the same Valley, and not to bee compared in offerings and other Church duties to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other Townes about that Country) which yet yeelded unto mee with the offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings cast into the Chests which stood in the Churches for the souls of Purgatory, and with what the <hi>Indians</hi> offered when they came to speake unto mee (for they never visit the Preist with empty hands) and with what other Masse stipends did casually come in, the summe of at least two thousand Crownes of <hi>Spanish</hi> money, which might yeerly mount to five hundred <hi>English</hi> pounds. I thought this Benefice might bee a fitter place for mee to live in, then in the Cloister of <hi>Guatemala,</hi> wearying out my braines with points of false grounded Divinity for to get onely the applause of the Scholars of the University, and now and then some small profit; which I thought I might looke after as well as the rest of my profession, nay with more reason, for that I intended to return to <hi>England,</hi> and I knew I should have little help for so long a journey in leaving there my friends, if so bee that I made not my mony my best freind to assist mee by Sea and Land. My first indeavour was to certifie my selfe from the Book of Receipts and Accounts in the Cloister of <hi>Guatemala,</hi> what reckonings my Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decessor and others before him had given up to the Cloister yeerly from <hi>Mixco</hi> and <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nola,</hi> that I might regulate my selfe and my expenses so, as to be able to live with cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, and to get thanks from the Cloister by giving more then any before me had given. I found that four hundred crowns had been the most that my old Predecessour had given yeerly in his Accounts; and that before him little more was usually given from those two Towns; Whereupon I took occasion once in discourse with the Prior of <hi>Guatemala</hi> to aske what hee would willingly expect from mee yeerly whilst I lived in those two Towns; to which he replyed that if I upheld for my part the Cloisters usuall and yeerly Revenues, giving what my Predecessour had given, he would thanke me, and expect no more from mee, and that the rest that befell mee in those Towns, I might spend it in Books, Pictures, Chocolattee, Mules, and Servants; to which I made reply, that I thought I could live in that Benefice creditably enough, and yet give from it more to the Cloister then ever any other before mee had given, and that I would forfeit my conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing there if I gave not to the Cloister every year four hundred and fifty Crowns. The Prior thanked mee heartily for it, and told mee I should not want for wine, (wishing mee to send for it every moneth) nor for clothing, which hee would every yeer once bestow upon me. This I thought would save a great part of my charges, and that I was well provided for as long as I lived in the <hi>India's.</hi> And here I desire, that <hi>England</hi> may take notice how a Fryer that hath professed to be a Mendicant, being beneficed in <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica,</hi> may live with foure hundred pounds a yeer cleare, and some with much more, with most of his cloathing given him besides, and the most charge of his wine supplyed, with the abundance of Fowles, which cost him nothing, and with such plenty of Beef, as yeelds him thirteen pound for three pence? Surely well may hee game, buy good Mules, furnish his chamber with hangings, and rich pictures, and Cabinets, yea and fill them with <hi>Spanish</hi> Pistols, and peeces of eight, and after all trade in the Court of <hi>Madrid</hi> for a Mitre and fat Bishoprick, which commonly is the end of those proud worldly and lazy Lubbars.</p>

                  <pb n="163" facs="tcp:53246:87"/>After I was once setled in these my two Townes, my first care was to provide my selfe of a good mule, which might soon and easily carry mee (as often as occasion cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led) from the one Towne to the other.

They were after the manner of our Grashoppers, but somewhat bigger, which did flye about in number so thick and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite that they did truly cover the face of the Sun and hinder the shining forth of the beames of that bright planet. Where they lighted either upon trees or standing Corn, there nothing was expected but ruine, destruction and barrennesse; for the corn they devoured, the leaves and fruits of trees they eat and consumed, and hung so thick upon the branches, that with their weight they tore them from the body. The high waies were so covered with them that they startled the travelling Mules with their fluttering about their head and feet; my eyes were often struck with their wings as I rid along, and much a doe I had to see my way, what with a Montero where with I was saine to cover my face, what with the flight of them which were still before my eyes.</p>

                  </gap>ry of the husbandmen of the Valley where I lived, who feared that their Corn would in one night be swallowed up by that devouring Legion. The care of the Magistrate was that the Townes of <hi>Indians</hi> should all goe out into the fields with Trumpets, and what other instruments they had to make a noise, and so to affright them from those places which were most considerable and profitable to the Common-wealth; and strange it was to see how the loud noise of the <hi>Indians</hi> and sounding of the Trumpets, defended some fields from the feare and danger of them. Where they lighted in the Mountaines and High wayes, there they left behind them their young ones, which were found creeping upon the ground ready to threate<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>Thus with much trouble to the poore <hi>Indians,</hi> and their great paines (yet after much hurt and losse in many places) was that flying Pestilence chased away out of the Country to the South Sea, where it was thought to bee consumed by the Ocean, and to have found a grave in the waters, whilst the young ones found it in the Land. Yet they were not all so burled, but that shortly some appeared, which not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

so many in number as before were with the former diligence soon overcome. But whilst all this feare was, these outcries were made by the Country and this diligence performed by the <hi>Indians,</hi> the Preists got well by it; for every where Processions were made, and Masses sung for the averting of that Plague. In <hi>Mixco</hi> most of the idols were carryed to the field, especially the pictures of our Lady, and that of St. <hi>Nicolas Tolentine,</hi> in whose name the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> doth use to blesse little Breads and Wafers with the Saint stamped upon them; which they think are able to defend them from Agues, Plague, Pestilence, Contagion, or any other great and imminent danger. There was scarce any <hi>Spanish</hi> Husbandman who in this occasion came not from the Valley to the Town of <hi>Mixco</hi> with his offering to this Saint, and who made not a vow to have a Masse sung unto Saint <hi>Nicolas<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> they all brought breads to bee blessed, and carryed them back to their Farmes, some casting them into their Corn, some burying them in their hedges and fences, strongly tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting in Saint <hi>Nicolus,</hi> that his bread would have power to keepe the Locust out of their fields; and so at the last those simple, ignorant, and blinded soules, when they saw the Locusts departed and their Corn safe, cried out to our Lady some, others to Saint <hi>Nicolas,</hi> Magro, a Miracle, judging the Saint worthy of praise more then God, and performing to him their vows of Masses, which in their feare and trouble they had vowed, by which erroneous and idolatrous devotion of theirs I got that yeer ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more Crownes then what before I have numbred from the Sodalities. The next yeere following, all that country was generally infected with a kinde of contagious sicknesse, almost as infectious as the Plague, which they call Tabardillo, and was a Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver in the very inward parts and bowels, which scarce continued to the seventh day, but commonly tooke them away from the world to a grave the the third or fifth day. The filthy smell and stench which came from them, which lay sick of this disease was enough to infect the rest of the house, and all that came to see them; It rotted their very mouths and tongues, and made them as black as a coal before they died. Very few <hi>Spaniards</hi> were infected with this Contagion; but the <hi>Indians</hi> generally were ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with it. It was reported to have begun about <hi>Mexico,</hi> and to have spread from Town to Town, till it came to <hi>Guatemala,</hi> and went on forwards; and so likewise did the Locusts the yeer before, marching as it were from <hi>Mexico</hi> over all the Country. I visited many that died of this infection, using no other Antidote against it, save onely a handkerchief dipped in Vineger to smell unto, and I thanke God I escaped where many dyed. In <hi>Mixco,</hi> I buried ninety young and old, and in <hi>Pinola</hi> above an hundred; and for all these that were eight yeere old, or upwards, I received two Crownes for a Masse for their soules delivery out of Purgatory. See good Reader, whether the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit of Purgatory have not been a maine policy of <hi>Rome</hi> to enrich the Preist and Clergy, with Masse stipends from such as die, making them beleeve that nothing else can helpe their soules if once plunged into that conceited fire; Where thou maist see that one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious sicknesse in two small Townes of <hi>Indians</hi> brought unto me in lesse then half a yeer neere a hundred pounds for Masses, for almost two hundred that died. Nay such is the greedy covetousnesse of those Preists, that they will receive three or four Masse stipends for one day, making the people beleeve that the same Masse may bee offered up for many, and doe one soule as much good as another. Thus with the Plague of Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>custs, and the contagion of sicknesse, for the first two yeers together had I an occasion to enrich my self, as did other Preists my neighbours. But think not that because so many died, therefore the Towns growing lesse my offerings for the future were lessen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The Encomendero's or Lords of the two Towns took care for that, who, that they might not lose any part of that Tribute which was formerly paid unto them, presently after the sicknesse was ceased, caused them to bee numbred, and (as I have in the Chapter before observed) forced to marriage all that were twelve yeers and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards of age; which also was a new streame of Crownes flowing into my bagges; for from every couple that were married I had also two Crownes besides other offerings, and in both the Towns, I married in that occasion above fourescore Couple. Truly by all this, I thank the Lord, I was more strengthened in my conceit against the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and not with that greedinesse of that Lucre intised to continue in it, though I found the preferments there farre greater then any might bee in the Church of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi> where I knew nothing was to bee got with singing, or hudling over a Masse; But yet though for the present my profit was great, my eyes were open to see the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours whereby that profit came so plentifully to mee, and to all that crew of Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous

Preists: The judgments ceased not here in that Country in my time; but after this contagion there was such an Inundation of rain that the husbandmen feared again the losse of all their Corn. At noonetime the darke clouds for a month together be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to thicken and cover the face of the heavens, powring down such stormy showres as swept away much Corn, and many poore Cottages of <hi>Indians;</hi> besides the raine, the fiery thunder bolts breaking through the clouds threatned a dolefull judgement to all the Country.

This stormy season brought me also much profit, for (as formerly) the <hi>Spaniards</hi> of the valley and the <hi>Indians</hi> betooke them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to their Idol Saints carrying them about in procession, which was not done without mony, which they call their almes unto their Saints, that they may the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter be heard and intreated by them.</p>

These earthquakes when they begin are more often, then long, for they last but for a while, stirring the earth with three motions, first on the one side, then on the other, and with the third motion they seem to set it right againe.

Thus was I twice saved by my good God in <hi>Mixco,</hi> and in <hi>Pinola</hi> I was once no lesse in danger in losing a leg by means of a smaller instrument then is a flea.</p>
               <p>This Towne of <hi>Pinola</hi> in the <hi>Indian</hi> language is called <hi>Panac; Pan,</hi> signifieth in, or amongst, <hi>Cac,</hi> signifieth three thinges; for it signifieth the fire, or a fruit other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise called <hi>guiava;</hi> or thirdly, a small vermine, commonly called by the <hi>Spaniards, Nigua;</hi> which is common over all the <hi>India's,</hi> but more in some places then in others. Where there are many hogs, there is usually much of this sort of vermine. The <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi> report that many of the Souldiers of <hi>Sir Francis Drake</hi> died of them, when they landed about <hi>Nombre de Dios,</hi> and marched up the high Mountaines of St. <hi>Pablo</hi> towards <hi>Panama,</hi> who feeling their feet to itch, and not knowing the cause thereof, scratched them so much, till they festred, and at last, (if this report be true)cost them their lives. Some say, they breed in all places, high and low, upon Tables, Beds, and upon the ground; but experience sheweth the contrary, that they onely breed upon the ground, for where the houses are sluttish, and not often swept, there commonly they are most felt; and in that they usually get into the Feet and Shooes, and seldome into the hands or any other part of the body, argues that they breed upon the ground. They are lesse then the least Flea, and can scarce bee perceived, and when they enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Foot, they make it burn and itch; and if then they bee looked to, they appeare black, and no bigger then the point of a pin, and with a pin may easily bee taken out whole; but if part of them bee left, the smallest part will doe as much harm as the whole, and will get into the flesh. When once they are got in, they breed a little bagge in the flesh, and in it a great many Nits, which increase bigger and bigger to the bignesse of a great Pea; then they begin again to make the Foot itch, which if it be scratched, falleth to sestering, and so indangereth the whole Foot. Some hold it best to take them out when they cause the first itching and are getting in; but this is hard to doe, because they can hardly then bee perceived, and they are apt to bee broken. Therefore others commonly let them alone, untill they bee got into the flesh, and have bred a bag with nit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>, which like a blister sheweth it self through the skinne, and then with the point of a pin, they dig round about the bag, till they can with the pins point take it out whole, if it bee broken, it comes to breed againe; if it bee taken out whole, then they put in a little Eare wax, or ashes where the bag lay, and with that the hole is healed up againe in a day or two. The way to avoid this vermines entering into the foot, is to lay both shoos and stockings, or whatsoever other clothing upon some stool or chair high from the ground, and not to go bare<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> foot; which yet is wonderfull in the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians</hi> themselves, that though they cmmonly doe goe barefoot, yet they are seldome troubled with them, which is attributed to the hardnesse of their skin; for certainly were they as tender footed and skinned as are those that wear both shoos and stockins, they would be as much troubled with them as these are. <hi>Pancac</hi> or <hi>Pinola,</hi> is much subject to this Vermin, or <hi>Nigua,</hi> and I found it by wofull experience, for at my first comming thither not knowing well the quality of it, I let one breed so long in my foot, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued scratching it, untill my foot came to be so festered, that I was fain to li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Though true it is, most of the <hi>Indians</hi> are but for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally Christians, and onely outwardly appear such, but secretly are given to witchcraft and idolatry, yet as they were under my charge, I thought by preaching Christ unto them, and by cherishing them, and defending them from the cruelty of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> I might better worke upon them to bring them to more knowledge of some truths, at least concerning God and Christ. Therefore as I found them truely loving, kind and bountifull unto mee, so I indeavoured in all occasions to shew them love by commise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating

This my love and pity towards them had almost in <hi>Pinola</hi> cost mee my life; For an <hi>Indian</hi> of that Town serving a <hi>Spaniard</hi> named <hi>Francisco de Montenegro</hi> (who lived a mile and a half from thence) was once so pittifully beaten and wounded by his Master, for that hee told him hee would com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain to mee that hee payed him not his wages, that he was brought home to the Town, and had I not out of my charity called for a Chirurgion from <hi>Petap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

I could not but complain for the poor <hi>Indian</hi> unto the President of <hi>Guatemala,</hi> who respecting my complaint, sent for my <hi>Spaniard</hi> to the City, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisoned him, and kept him close untill the <hi>Indian</hi> was recovered, and so with a Fine sent him back againe. In a Sermon further I pressed this home unto the neighbouring <hi>Spaniards,</hi> warning them of the wrongs &amp; abuses which they offered unto the poor <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians,</hi> which I told them I would put up no more then any injury done unto my self, for that I looked upon them as Neophytes and new plants of Christianity, who were not to be discouraged, but by all means of love incouraged to come to Christ, withall I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded all the <hi>Indians</hi> that had any wrong done unto them, to come unto mee, as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suring them that I would make such a complaint for them as should bee heard, as they might perceive I had lately done to some purpose.

had often set dogs at her and they would not meddle with her, but rather run away from her. This Duck never appeared more with her, since she was formerly accused be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Justice, which was thought to be her policy, that she might be no more suspected thereby. This old woman was a widow, and of the poorest of the Town in outward shew, and yet she alwaies had store of mony, which none could tel which way she might come by it. Whilst I was thus taking privy information against her (it being the time of Lent, when all the Town came to Confession)she among the rest came to the Church to confesse her sins, and brought me the best present and offering of all the Towne, for whereas a Riall is common she brought me four, and besides a Turkey, egs, fish, and a little bottle of hony. She thought thereby to get with me a better opinion then I had of her from the whole Towne; I accepted of her great offering, and heard her Confession, which was of nothing but trifles, which could scarce be judged sinfull actions. I examined her very close of what was the common judgement of all the <hi>Indians,</hi> and especially of those who dying had declared to my selfe at their death that she had bewitched them, and before their sicknesse had threatned them, and in their sicknes appeared threatning them with death about their beds, none but they themselves seeing her. To which she replyed weeping, that she was wronged; I asked her, how she being a poore widow without any sons to helpe her, without any meanes of lively<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood had so much mony, as to give me more then the richest of the Town, how she came by that fish, Turkey, and hony, having none of this of her owne about her house? to which she replyed, that God loved her and gave her all these things, and that with her mony she had bought the rest. I asked her of whom? she answered that out of the Towne she had them. I perswaded her much to repentance, and to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake the Devill and all fellowship with him; but her words and answers were of a Saintly and holy woman; and she earnestly desired me to give her the Communion with the rest that were to receive the next day. Which I told her I durst not doe, using Christs words, Give not the childrens bread unto dogs, nor cast your pearls unto swine; and that it would be a great scandall to give the Communion unto her, who was su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spected generally, and had been accused for a witch. This she took very ill telling me that she had many yeers received the Communion, and now in her old age it grieved her to be deprived of it; her teares were many, yet I could not be moved with them, but resolutely denied her the Communion, and so dismissed her. At noone when I had done my worke in the Church, I bad my servants goe to gather up the offerings, and gave order to have the fish dressed for my dinner which she had brought; but no soo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner was it carried into the Kitchin, when the Cook looking on it found it full of mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gots, and stinking, so that I was forced to hurle it away. With that I began to sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect my old witch, and went to looke on her hony, and powring it out into a dish, I found it full of wormes, her egs I could not know from others, there being neer a hundred offered that day; but after as I used them, we found some rotten, some with dead chickens within; the next morning the Turkey was found dead; as for her four Rials, I could not perceive whether she had bewitched them out of my pocket, for that I had put them with many other, which that day had been given me, yet as far as I could, I called to memory who and what had been given me, and in my judgement and recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning I verily thought that I missed four Rials. At night when my servants the <hi>Indians</hi> were gone to bed, I sate up late in my chamber betaking my selfe to my bookes and study, for I was the next morning to make an exhortation to those that received the Communion. After I had studyed a while, it being between ten and eleven of the clock, on a suddain the chief door in the hall (wherein a lower roome was my cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and te servants, and three other doores) flew open, and I heard one come in, and for a while walke about; then was another doore opened which went into a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle room; where my saddles were laid<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>; with this I thought it might be the Black-more <hi>Miguel Dalva,</hi> who would often come late to my house to lodge there, especially since my fearof <hi>Montenegroe,</hi> and I conjectured that he was laying up his saddle, I called un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him by his name two or three times from within my chamber, but no answer was made; but suddainly another door that went out to a garden flew also open, wherewith I began within to feare, my joynts trembled, my haire stood up, I would have called out to the servants, and my voice was as it were stopped with the sudden affright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, I began to thinke of the witch, and putmy trust in God against her, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged my selfe and voice calling out to the servants, and knocking with a cane at
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:53246:90"/>
my doore within that they might heare me, for I durst not open it and goe out. With the noise which I made the servants awaked and came out to my chamber doore; then I opened it, and asked them if they had not heard some body in the hall, and all the doores opened. They said they were asleep, and heard nothing, onely one boy said he heard all, and related unto me the same that I had heard. I tooke my candle then in my hand and went out into the hall with them to view the doors, and I found them all shut, as the servants said they had left them. Then I perceived that the witch would have affrighted me, but had no power to doe me any harme; I made two of the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants lie in my chamber, and went to bed. In the morning early I sent for my <hi>Fiscal</hi> the Clerk of the Church, and told him what had happened that night; he smiled upon me, and told me it was the widow <hi>Carillo,</hi> who had often played such tricks in the Town with those that had offended her, and therefore he had the night before come unto me from her desiring me to give her the Communion, left she should doe me some hurt, which I denied unto him, as I had done to her selfe. The Clerk bad me be of good cheere, for he knew she had no power over me to do me any hurt. After the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that day some of the chief <hi>Indians</hi> came unto me, and told me that old <hi>Carillo</hi> had boasted that she would play me some trick or other, because I would not give her the Communion. But I to rid the Towne of such a limbe of Satan, sent her to <hi>Guate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mala,</hi> with all the evidences and witnesses which I had found against her unto the President and Bishop, who commanded her to be put in prison, where she died within two moneths.</p>
               <p>Many more <hi>Indians</hi> there were in that Town, who were said in my time to doe very strange things. One called <hi>Iohn Gonzalez</hi> was reported to change himselfe into the shape of a Lion, and in that shape was one day shot in the nose by a poore harmelesse <hi>Spaniard</hi> who chiefly got his living by going about the woods and mountaines, and shooting at wild Deer and other beasts to make mony of them. He espied one day a Lion, and having no other ayme at him but his snout behind a tree, he shot at him; the Lion run away; the same day this <hi>Gonzalez</hi> was taken sick, I was sent for to hear his Confession, I saw his face and nose all bruised, and asked him how it came, he told me then that he had fallen from a tree and almost killed himself; yet afterwards he accused the poore <hi>Spaniard</hi> for shooting at him; the businesse was examined by a <hi>Spanish</hi> Justice, my evidence was taken for what <hi>Gonzalez</hi> told me of his fall from a tree, the <hi>Spaniard</hi> was put to his oath, who sware that he shot at a Lion in a thicke wood, where an <hi>Indian</hi> could scarce be thought to have any businesse, the tree was found out in the wood, whereat the shot had been made and was still marked with the shot and bullet; which <hi>Gonzalez</hi> confessed was to be the place; and was examined how he neither fell nor was seen by the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> when he came to seeke for the Lion think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he had killed; to which he answered that he ran away lest the <hi>Spaniard</hi> should kill him indeed. But his answers seeming frivolous, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> integrity being known, and the great suspicion that was in the Town of <hi>Gonzalez</hi> his dealing with the Devill, cleared the <hi>Spaniard</hi> from what was laid against him.</p>
               <p>But this was nothing to what after happened to one <hi>Iohn Gomez,</hi> the chiefest <hi>Indian</hi> of that Towne of neer fourscore yeers of age, the Head and Ruler of the principallest Tribe among the <hi>Indians,</hi> whose advise and counsell was taken and preferred before all the rest, who seemed to be a very godly <hi>Indian,</hi> and very seldome missed morning and evening prayers in the Church, and had bestowed great riches there. This <hi>Indian</hi> very suddainly was taken sick (I being then in my other Town of <hi>Mixco</hi>) the <hi>Mayordomos,</hi> or stewards of the Sodality of the Virgin fearing that he might die without Confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and they be child for their negligence, at midnight called me up at <hi>Mixco,</hi> desiring me to goe presently and helpe <hi>Iohn Gomtz</hi> to die, whom also they said desired much to see me and to receive some comfort from me. I judging it a work of charity, although the time of the night were unseasonable, and the great rain at the present might have stopped my charity, yet I would not be hindred by either of them, and so set forth to ride nine miles both in the dark and wet. When I came to <hi>Pinola</hi> being thorow wet to the skin, I went immediately to the house of old sick <hi>Gomez,</hi> who lay with his face all muffled up, thanked me for my pains and care I had for his soul; he desired to confesse, and by his confession and weeping evidenced nothing but a godly life, and a willing desire to die and to be with Christ. I comforted him and prepared him for death, and before I departed, asked him how he felt himselfe; he answered that his sicknesse was
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:53246:91"/>
nothing but old age, and weaknesse. With this I went to my house, changed my self and lay downe a while to rest, when suddainly I was called up again to give <hi>Gomez</hi> the extream unction, which the <hi>Indians</hi> (as they have been ignorantly taught) will not omit to receive before they die. As I anointed him in his nose, his lips, his eyes, his hands and his feet, I perceived that he was swelled, and black and blew; but made no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of it, judging it to proceed from the sicknesse of his body; I went again home being now breake of the day, when after I had taken a small nap, some <hi>Indians</hi> come to my doore for to buy candles to offer up for <hi>Iohn Gomez</hi> his soule, whom they told me was departed, and was that day to be buried very solemnly at Masse. I arose with drousie eyes after so unquiet a nights rest; and walked to the Church, where I saw the grave was preparing. I met with two or three <hi>Spaniards</hi> who lived neer the Towne and were come to Masse that morning, who went in with me to my chamber, and with them I fell into discourse about <hi>Iohn Gomez,</hi> telling them what comfort I had received at his death, whom I judged to have lived very holily, and doubted not of his salvation, and that the Towne would much want him, for that hee was their chief guide, and leader, ruling them with good advise and counsell. At this the <hi>Spaniards</hi> smiled one at another, and told me I was much deceived by all the <hi>Indians,</hi> but especially by the deceased <hi>Gomez,</hi> if I judged him to have been a Saint, and holy man. I told them that they as enemies to the poore <hi>Indians</hi> judged still uncharitably of them; but that I who knew very well their consciences, could judge better of them then they. One then replyed, that it seemed I little knew the truth of <hi>Iohn Gomez</hi> his death by the Confession which he had made unto me, and that I seemed to be ignorant of the stir which was in the Towne concerning his death. This seemed so strange unto me, that I desired them to informe me of the truth. Then they told me that the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port went, that <hi>Iohn Gomez</hi> was the chief wizard of all the wizards and witches in the Town, and that commonly he was wont to be changed into the shape of a Lion, and so to walke about the mountaines. That he was ever a deadly enemie to one <hi>Sebastian Lopez</hi> an ancient <hi>Indian,</hi> and head of another Tribe; and that both of them two daies before had met in the mountaine, <hi>Gomez</hi> in the shape of a Lion, and <hi>Lopez</hi> in the shape of a Tigre, and that they fought most cruelly, till <hi>Gomez</hi> (who was the ol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and weaker) was tired, much bit and bruised; and died of it. And further that I might be assured of this truth, they told me that <hi>Lopez</hi> was in prison for it, and the two Tribes striving about it; and that the Tribe and kindred of <hi>Gomez</hi> demanded from <hi>Lopez</hi> and his Tribe and kindred satisfaction, and a great sum of mony, or els did threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to make the case known unto the <hi>Spanish</hi> power and authority, which yet they were unwilling to doe if they could agree and smother it up among themselves, that they might not bring an aspersion upon their whole Towne. This seemed very strange un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me, and I could not resolve what to beleeve, and thought I would never more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve an <hi>Indian,</hi> if I found <hi>Iohn Gomez</hi> to have so much dissembled and deceived me. I tooke my leave of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> and went my selfe to the prison, where I found <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pez</hi> with fetters. I called one of the officers of the Towne, who was Alguazil Maior, and my great friend, unto my house, and privately examined him why <hi>Lopez</hi> was kept so clos<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

But I seeing the officer so timorous, was more desirous to know some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and pressed more upon him for the truth giving him an inkling of what I had heard from the <hi>Spaniards</hi> before. To which he answered that if they could agree a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst themselves, they feared no ill report from the <hi>Spaniards</hi> against their Towne; I told him I must know what they were agreeing upon amongst themselves so closely in the Towne-house. He told me, if I would promise him to say nothing of, him (for he feared the whole Towne if they should know he had revealed any thing unto mee) he would tel me the truth. With this I comforted him, and gave him a cup of wine, and encouraged him, warranting him that no harm should come unto him for what he told me. Then he related the businesse unto me as the <hi>Spaniards</hi> had done, and told me that he thought the Tribes amongst themselves would not agree, for that some of <hi>Gomez</hi> his friends hated <hi>Lopez</hi> and all such a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="171" facs="tcp:53246:91"/>
were as bad as <hi>Lopez</hi> and <hi>Gomez,</hi> would have it kept close, lest they and all the wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and Wizards of the Town should bee discovered. This struck mee to the very heart, to think that I should live among such people, whom I saw were spending all they could get by their worke and labour upon the Church, Saints and in offerings, and yet were so privy to the counsels of Satan; it grieved mee that the Word I preached unto them, did no more good, and I resolved from that time forward to spend most of my indeavours against Satans subtility, and to shew them more then I had done, the great danger of their soules who had made any compact with the Devill, that I might make them abandon and abjure his workes, and close with Christ by Faith. I dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missed the <hi>Indian,</hi> and went to the Church, to see if the people were come to Masse; I found there no body but onely two who were making <hi>Gomez</hi> his Grave. I went back to my Chamber, troubled much within my self, whether I should allow him a Christian Buriall, who had lived and died so wickedly, as I had been informed. Yet I thought I was not bound to beleeve one <hi>Indian</hi> against him, nor the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> whom I supposed spoke but by hearsay. Whilst I was thus musing, there came unto mee at least twenty of the chiefest of the Town with the two Majors, Jurates, and all the Officers of Justice, who desired mee to forbeare that day the burying of <hi>Iohn Gomez,</hi> for that they had resolved to call a Crowne Officer to view his Corps and examine his death, lest they all should bee troubled for him, and hee againe unburied. I made as if I knew nothing, but inquired of them the reason; then they related all unto me, and told me how there were witnesses in the Town who saw a Lyon and a Tyger fighting, and presently lost the sight of the beasts, and saw <hi>Iohn Gomez,</hi> and <hi>Sebastian Lopez,</hi> much about the same place parting one from another; and that immediately <hi>Iohn Gomez</hi> came home bruised to his bed, from whence he never rise more, and that he declaredupon his death-bead unto some of his friends that <hi>Sebastian Lopez</hi> had killed him; whereupon they had him in safe custody. Further they told me that though they had never known so much wickednesse of these two chief heads of their Towne whom they had much respected and followed, yet now upon this occasion, from the one Tribe and the other they were certainly informed that both of them did constantly deale with the Devill, which would bee a great aspersion upon their Town, but they for their parts abjured all such wicked wayes, and prayed me not to conceive the worse of all for a few, whom they were resolved to persecute, and suffer not to live amongst them. I told them I much liked their good zeal, and incouraged them as good Christians to indeavour the rooting out of Satan from their Towne, and they did very well in giving notice to <hi>Guatemala,</hi> to the <hi>Spanish</hi> power, of this accident, and that if they had concealed it, they might all have been punished as guilty of <hi>Gomez</hi> his death, and Agents with Satan, and his instruments. I assured them I had no ill conceipt of them, but rather judged well of them for what they were agreed to doe. The Crowne Officer was sent for who came that night and searched <hi>Gomez</hi> his body; I was present with him, and found it all bruised, scratched, and in many places bitten and sore wounded. Many eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and suspitions were brought in against <hi>Lopez</hi> by the <hi>Indians</hi> of the Town, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all by <hi>Gomez</hi> his friends, whereupon hee was carryed away to <hi>Guatemala,</hi> and there againe was tryed by the same witnesses, and not much denying the fact himself, was there hanged. And <hi>Gomez,</hi> though his grave was opened in the Church, hee was not buried in it, but in another made ready for him in a Ditch.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Mixco</hi> I found also some <hi>Indians</hi> no lesse dissemblers then was this <hi>Gomez,</hi> and those of the chiefest and richest of the Town, who were foure Brothers called <hi>Fuentei,</hi> and half a score more. These were outwardly very faire tongued, liberall, and free handed to the Church, much devoted to the Saints, great feasters upon their day, and yet in secret great Idolaters. But it pleased God to make mee his instrument, to discover and bring to light the secrecy of their hidden works of darknesse, which it seems the privacy of a thick Wood and Mountaine had many yeers hid from the eyes of the World. Some of these being one day in the company of other better Christians drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hard of their <hi>Chicha,</hi> boasted of their God, saying that hee had preached unto them better then I could preach, nay that hee had plainly told them that they should not beleeve any thing that I preached of Christ, but follow the old wayes of their Forefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, who worshipped their Gods aright, but now by the example of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> they were deluded, and brought to worship a false God. The other Christians hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this began to wonder, and to enquire of them where that God was, and with
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:53246:92"/>
much ado, promising to follow their ways, and their God, got out of them the place and Mountain where they might find him. Though this in drunkennes were agreed upon, yet in sobernes the good Christians thought better of what they had agreed upon, slighted what before in drinking they heard, and yet it was not kept by them so close, but that it came to the ears of a <hi>Spaniard</hi> in the Vally; who finding himself touched in Conscience, came to <hi>Mixco</hi> to me, and told me what he had heard, that some <hi>Indians</hi> of that town fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed an Idol, and boasted that he had preached unto them against my Doctrine, and for the ways of the former Heathens. I thanked God for that he was pleased to undermine the secret works of Satan daily; and desired the <hi>Spaniard</hi> to tell me by whom hee came to know of this. He told me the <hi>Indians</hi> name from whom he had it, and that he was afraid to discover the <hi>Indians,</hi> and to tell mee of it. I sent for the <hi>Indian</hi> before the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> who confessed unto mee that hee had heard of such a thing; but knew that if hee did discover the <hi>Indians,</hi> they with the power of the Devill would doe him much harm; I told him, if hee were a true Christian, hee ought to fight against the Devill, and not to feare him, who could do him no harm if God were with him, and he closed by Faith with Christ, and that the discovery of that Idoll might bee a meanes for the convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Idolaters, when they should see the small power of their false God against the true God of the Christians. Further I told him plainly, that if hee did not tell mee who the <hi>Indians</hi> were, and where their Idol was, that I would have him to <hi>Guatemala,</hi> and there make him discover what hee knew. Here the <hi>Indian</hi> began to tremble, and told mee the <hi>Fuentes</hi> had boasted of such an Idol, whom they called their God, and gave some signes of a Fountaine and of a Pine Tree at the mouth of a Cave in such a Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine. I asked him, if hee knew the place, or what kind of Idol it was; hee told mee, that hee had often been in that Mountaine, where hee had seen two or three springs of water, but never was in any Cave. I asked him if he would goe with me, and helpe mee to find it out, hee refused still fearing the Idolaters, and wished mee not to goe, for fear if they should bee there, they might kill mee rather then bee discovered. I answered him that I would carry with mee such a Guard as should bee able to defend mee against them, and my Faith in the true living God, would secure mee against that false God. I resolved therefore with the <hi>Spaniard</hi> to goe to search out the cave the next day, and to carry with mee three or foure <hi>Spaniards</hi> and my Blackmore <hi>Miguel Dalva,</hi> and that <hi>Indian.</hi> I told him I would not suffer him to goe home to his house that day, for feare hee should discover in the Towne my designe and purpose, and so wee might bee prevented by the Idolaters, who certainly that night would take away their Idol. The <hi>Indian</hi> still refused, till I threatned him to send for the Officers of Justice, and to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure his person; with this hee yeelded, and that hee might have no discourse with any body in the Town, nor with the Servants of my house, I desired the <hi>Spaniard</hi> to take him home to his house, and to keep him there close that day and night, promising to bee with him the next morning. I charged the <hi>Spaniard</hi> also with secresie, and so dismissed him with the <hi>Indian.</hi> That day I rid to <hi>Pinola</hi> for the Blackmore <hi>Miguel Dalva,</hi> and brought him to <hi>Mixco</hi> with mee, not telling him what my intent was; I went also to foure neighbouring <hi>Spaniards,</hi> desiring them to bee in a readinesse the next morning to goe a little way with mee for the service of God, and to meet mee at such <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap> neighbours house, and that if they would bring their Fowling peeces, wee might chance to find some sport where wee went, and as for Provision of Wine and Meat, I would provide sufficiently. They promised to goe with mee, thinking that although I told them, it was for the service of God, my purpose onely was to hunt after some wild Deere in the mountaines. I was glad they construed my action that way, and so went home, and provided that night a good Gammon of Bacon, and some Fowles rosted, cold, and others boiled, well peppered and salted for the next dayes work. Where I had appointed my <hi>Indian</hi> to be kept, I met with the rest of my company, and from thence wee went together to the place of the Idolaters worshipping, which was some six miles from <hi>Mixco</hi> towards the Town of St. <hi>Iohn Sacatepeques.</hi> When wee came into the Wood wee presently met with a deep Barranca, or bottome, where was a running, which incouraged us to make there diligent search, but nothing could bee found; from thence wee ascended up out of the Barranca, and found after much time spent a spring of water, and looked carefully about it, but could finde no Cave. Thus in vaine wee searched till the Evening, and fearing lest wee might lose our way and our selves, if the night over took us, my friends began to speak of returning homewards. But I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:53246:92"/>
that as yet wee had not gone over one half part of the Wood, and to goe home and come againe might make us to bee noted, and spoken of, wee thought it our best way to take up our lodging that night in the Wood, and in that bottome which we first searched, where was good water for to drinke Chocolatte, and warm lying under the trees, and so in the morning to make our second search. The Company was very willing to yeeld unto it, and the calme night favoured our good intentions. We made a fire for our Chocolatte, and supped exceeding well of our cold meat, and spent most part of the night in merry discourse, having a watchfull eye over our <hi>Indian,</hi> lest hee should give us the slip, and committing him to the charge of <hi>Miguel Dalva.</hi> In the morning wee prayed unto God, beseeching him to guide us that day in the work wee went about, and to discover unto us the Cave of darkenesse and iniquity, where lay hid that instrument of Satan, that so by his discovery Glory might bee given unto our true God, and shame and punishment brought upon his enemies. Wee entered a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine into the thick Wood up a steepy hill, and having throughly searched all the South side of it, wee went on to the North side, where wee found another deepe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scent, which wee began to walke downe looking on every side, and not in vain; for almost half a mile from the top wee found some markes of a way that had been used and trodden, which wee followed untill we came to another spring of water; we searched narrowly about it, and found some peeces of broken earthen dishes and pots, and one peece of a chasing dish, such as the <hi>Indians</hi> use to burne Frankincense in, in the Churches before their Saints, we verily imagined that these were peeces of some such instruments wherewith the idolaters performed their duty unto their Idol, and we were the more comforted for that wee knew that earthen ware had beene made in <hi>Mixco;</hi> the pine Tree which immediately we discovered confirmed our hopes. When wee came unto it we made very little more search, for neer at hand was the Cave, which was dark with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, but light at the mouth, where wee found more Earthen ware, with ashes in them, which assured us of some Frankincense that had been burned. Wee knew not how farre the Cave might reach within, nor what might bee in it, and therefore with a flint wee struck fire and lighted a couple of candles and went in; at the entering it was broad, and went a little forward, but when wee were in, we found it turn on the left hand towards the mountaine, and not farre; for within two rods wee found the Idol standing upon a low stooll covered with a linnen cloth. The substance of it was wood, black shining like Jet, as if it had been painted or smoaked, the form was of a mans head unto the shoulders, without either Beard or Mustachoes; his looke was grim with a wrinkled forehead, and broad startling eyes. We feared not his frowning look, but presently seized upon him; and as wee lifted him up we found under him some sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle Rials, which his Favorites had offered unto him; which made us search more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently the Cave; and it was not amisse, for wee found upon the ground more single Rials, some plantines and other fruits, wax candles halfe burned, pots of Maiz, one little one of Hony, little dishes wherein Frankincense had been burned, whereby I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the Idolaters and Christians both agreed in their offerings; and had I not been informed that they called this Idol their God, I could have blamed them no more then the rest of the Townes who worship, kneel before and offer such offerings unto their Saints made of Wood, and some no handsomer then was this Idol, which I thought, might have beene some beasts shape; but being the shape and form of a man, they might have named him by the name of some Saint, and so some way have excused them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, which they could not doe, nor would they doe it, in that they persisted in this error, that he was their God, and had spoken and preached unto them, and being after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards asked by mee, whether it were the picture of any Saint, such as were in <hi>Mixco,</hi> and other Churches, they answered, No, but that hee was above all the Saints in the Countrey.</p>
               <p>Wee were very joyfull to see that wee had not spent our time in vaine, wee cut down boughes of trees, and filled the Cave with them and stopped the mouth of it up, and came away, making the <hi>Indian</hi> that went with us carry the Idol on his back wrap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped up in a cloth, that it might not bee seen or perceived as wee went. I thought it fit to delay the time till night, and then to enter into <hi>Mixco,</hi> that the <hi>Indians</hi> might see nothing. So I stayed at one of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> houses, till it were late, and desired him to warn from mee all the <hi>Spaniards</hi> there<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> abouts to be at <hi>Mixco</hi> Church the next Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, (fearing lest the Idolaters might bee many, and rise up against mee) that I had

somewhat to say unto them and their Blackmores concerning their Sodalities, for I would not have them know of the Idoll, till they heard of it and saw it in the Church, l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>st it should come to the <hi>Indians</hi> hearing, and so the Idolaters might absent them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. At night I tooke my <hi>Indian,</hi> and <hi>Miguel Dalva</hi> with mee, and went home, and shutting up the Idol in a chest till the next Sabbath, I dismissed the <hi>Indian,</hi> charging him to say nothing, for hee knew if hee did what harme might come unto him from the Idolaters, and I knew few words now would suffice, for that hee feared himselfe if it should bee known that hee had been with mee, I kept <hi>Miguel Dalva</hi> with mee, who was desirous to see the end of the businesse, and prepared my self against the next Sabbath to preach upon the 3. v. of the 20. of <hi>Exodus, Thou shalt have none other Gods be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mee,</hi> though it were a Text nothing belonging to the Gospel of the day, from whence commonly in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> the Texts and subjects of Sermons are deducted; but I judged that Text most seasonable for the present occasion. On the Sabbath day in the morning, when the Pulpit was made ready by him who had care of the Church and Altars, I caused <hi>Miguel Dalva</hi> to carry under his Cloak the Idol, and to leave it in the Pulpit upon the the ground that it might not bee seene, till such time as I should thinke fit in my Sermon to produce it, and to watch about the Church till the Congregation came in, that none might see it or take it away. Never was there a greater resort from abroad to that Church then that day of <hi>Spaniards</hi> and Black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mores, who by the warning I sent unto them expected some great matter from mee; and of the Town very few were absent, the <hi>Fuentes</hi> and all the rest that were suspected to be that Idols favorites (little thinking that their God was brought from his Cave, and now lay hid in the Pulpit to shame them) came also that day to Church. I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded <hi>Miguel Dalva,</hi> to bee himself neer the Pulpit at Sermon time, and to warne those <hi>Spaniards</hi> that knew the businesse, and some more Blackmores his friends to bee also neere the Pulpit staires.</p>
               <p>Thus Masse being ended, I went up to preach; when I rehearsed the words of my Text, I perceived both <hi>Spaniards</hi> and <hi>Indians</hi> began to look one upon another, as not being used to Sermons out of the Old Testament. I went on laying open this command of God, for having no other Gods before him, so that the Doctrine might seem to convince all that were there present, as well Saint-worshippers, as indeed that Idols worshippers, if the cause of my preaching upon that Subject had not diverted their eyes from themselves to behold their own guiltiness of Idolatry, &amp; to look only upon those who worshipped a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

After I had spoken what I thought fit concerning that horrible sin, and shewed that no creature could have the power of God (who was the Creator of all things) neither could doe good or harme without the true living Gods Commission, especially inanimate Creatures as stocks, and stones, who by the hands and workmanship of man might have eyes, and yet were dead Idol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>Thus having halfe finished my Sermon, I bowed my selfe downe in the Pulpit, and lifted up the black, grim, and staring Devill, and placed that Dagon on one side of the Pulpit, with my eyes fixed upon some of the <hi>Fuentes</hi> and others, who I perceived chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged their colour, blashed, and were sore troubled looking one upon another, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired the Congregation <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

After much arguing and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soning according to the shallow capacity of the <hi>Indians</hi> present, I told them if that their God had power to deliver him from that execution, which I had intended against him (which was there publikely to have him cut in pieces and burnt) they should not beleeve the Gospell of Jesus Christ; but if they saw no power at all in him against me the weakest instrument of the true living God, then I beseeched them to be conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unto that true God who created all things, and to imbrace salvation by his Son the only Mediatour and Saviour Jesus Christ, and to renounce and abjure from that time all Heat henish Idolatry of their forefathers, assuring them for what was past I would intercede for them, and secure them from what punishment might be inflicted upon them by the President and Bishop, and if they would come to me, I would spend my best indeavours for the helping and furthering of them in the way of Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>
               <p>And thus concluding without naming any person, I went downe out of the pulpit, and caused the Idol to be brought after me, and sending for an axe, and for two or three great pans of coales, I commanded him to be hewen in very small peeces<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and to be cast in the fire and burned before all the people in the midst of the Church.

But af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards they acted most spightfully against me, and conspired day and night to get me at some advantage, and to kill me. I writ to the President of <hi>Guatemala</hi> informing him of what I had done; and to the Bishop (as an Inquisitor to whom such cases of idolatry did belong) to be informed from him of what course I should take with the <hi>Indians</hi> who were but in part yet discovered unto me, and those onely by the rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of one <hi>Indian.</hi> From both I received great thanks for my paines in searching the mountaine, and finding out the Idol, and for my zeal in burning of it. And as touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Indian</hi> Idolaters their counsell unto me was, that I should further enquire af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the rest and discover as many as I could, and indeavour to convert them to the knowledge of the true God by faire and sweet meanes, shewing pity unto them for their great blindnesse, and promising them upon their repentance pardon from the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisition, which considering them to be but new plants useth not such rigour with them, which it useth with <hi>Spaniards</hi> if they fall into such horrible fins. This advise I followed, and sent privately for the <hi>Fuentes</hi> to my chamber, and told them how mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull the Inquisition was unto them, expecting their conversion and amendment. They seemed somewhat stubborne and angry for that I had burned that God, whom not only they, but many others in the Towne, and also in the Towne of Saint <hi>Iohn Sacatepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques</hi> did worship. I used reasons to perswade them no honour was due unto it, as to a God. But one of them boldly replyed, that they knew that it was a p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

I told them that the Devill rather had framed that speech (if any they had heard) for to deceive their souls and lead them to hell; which they might easily perceive from the Doctrin which I was informed he had preached against Christ the only begotten son of God, whom the Father loveth and in whom he is w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

answer from them. I perceived they would have come in by force, for they pushed hard at the doore. Whereupon I tooke suddainly the sheets from off my bed, tying them with a strong knot together, and with another to a bar of the window, making my selfe ready to fall down by them to the ground, and so to flie in the dark night, if they had used violence to come in. The sheets being thus prepared, and they still at the doore thrusting without any word from them, I thought by calling and crying out aloud I might affright them away. Wherefore with a shrill voice I called first to my ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, who were but boyes, and lay at the further end of a long gallery, then I cryed out to the neighbouring houses to come and assist me against theeves. The servants had heard the noise and were awake, who presently at my call came out; and with their coming my enemies ran down the staires, and were heard no more that night. But I perceiving which way their spight and malice was bent, thought fit to be no more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone in the night, with boyes only in so great a house as was that of <hi>Mixco;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the next day I sent for my trusty friend <hi>Miguel Dalva</hi> who was able to fight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone with any halfe dozen of <hi>Indians,</hi> wishing him to bring with him what weapons he could get for my defence. I kept him with me a fortnight; and the next Sabbath I gave warning in the Church, that whosoever came in the night to my house to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fright me, or to doe me any other mischiefe should looke to him selfe, for that I had weapons both offensive and defensive. Though for a while I heard no more of them, yet they desisted not altogether from their evill and malicious intents; for, knowing that <hi>Miguel Dalva</hi> did not lie in the same chamber with me, a fortnight after (I being till about midnight with my candle studying) they came up the staires so softly that I heard them not; but the <hi>Black-more</hi> being awake it seems perceived that they were coming up, and softly arose up from a long table were he lay upon a Mat, and tooke in his hand a couple of brick-bats of many which lay under the table for a worke which I had in hand, and as he opened the dore made a little noise, which was to them an item to flie down the staires, and to run (as they thought) for their lives. The <hi>Black-more</hi> did also run after them, and finding they had got too much advantage of him, and not knowing which way they might take, sent after them with a fury his two brick-bats, wherewith he supposed he did hit one of them, for the next day walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about the Towne he met with one of the <hi>Fuentes</hi> having a cap on his head, and he inquired of sone <hi>Indians</hi> what he ailed, and he understood by them that his head was broke, but how they knew not. They perceiving that I was thus guarded by <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guel Dalva,</hi> desisted from that time from coming any more in the night unto my house, but yet desisted not from their spight and malice and from acting mischiefe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst me. For a month after when I thought that all had been forgotten, and they seemed outwardly to be kind and curteous, there came a messenger to me from the ol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest of them, named <hi>Pablo de Fuentes,</hi> to tel me that he was very sick, and like to die, and desired me to goe to comfort and instruct him in the truth, for that he truely desired to be converted. I conceived very great joy at this newes, and doubted not of the truth and certainty of it, and prayed to God to direct me in the conversion of that soul; and so with haste and good zeal, I went unto his house, where soon my joy and comfort was turned into bitternesse; for when I came to the dore of his house, and was with one step entred, I found all the brothers of <hi>Pablo Fuentes,</hi> and some others who were suspected to be Idolaters, fitting round the room; and missing <hi>Pablo,</hi> I withdrew my foot a little, and asked them where he was, mistrusting somewhat to see them there all gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red together; but when I perceived that they stood not up, nor answered me a word, nor so much as tooke off their hats to me, then I began to fear indeed, and to suspect some treachery; and so I turned back resolving to goe home again. But no sooner was I turned, but behold <hi>Pablo Fuentes</hi> (who by his message had feigned both sicknesse and conversion, came from behind his house with a cudgell in his hand, listing it up to strike at me. Had I not catched hold of his stick with both my hands, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented the intended blow, certainly he had struck me down. But whilst he and I were striving for the stick who should be Master of it, the rest of the <hi>Indians</hi> who were sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in the house, came out into the yard (which being a publick place was more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to me then if they had compassed me about within the house)and beset me round, some pulling mee one way, some another, tearing my clothes in two or three places, another to make me let goe my hand from the stick with a knife run me into the hand (which to this day a small scar doth witnesse) and certainly had we not been in a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like

yard, that party would also have run his knife into my sides; another seeing I would not let goe the stick, tooke hold of it with <hi>Pablo</hi> and both together thrust it against my mouth, and with such strength that they broke some of my teeth, and fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led my mouth with goar blood, with which blow I fell, but soone recovered my selfe and arose, they laughing at me, but not daring to doe me any more harme for feare they should be seen, as God would have seen what already they had done; for a Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latta slave to a <hi>Spaniard</hi> in the valley, at that very time when I was down and rising pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by, and hearing me cry out for help to the neighbours (who lived somewhat far off that might helpe and succour me, for all the houses thereabouts were of the bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers the <hi>Fuentes</hi>) came into the yard, and seeing me all in blood thought I had been mortally wounded, and calling them murtherers ran along the street crying murther, murther in <hi>Pablo Fuentes</hi> his yard, till she came to the Market place and Town-house, where she found the Maiors and Jurats sitting, &amp; a couple of <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who when they heard of my danger, with drawn swords came presently running with all the officers of Justce to the yard of <hi>Pablo Fuentes</hi> to aid and assist me; but in the mean while the Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters perceiving the outcry of the Mulatta, began to fall away and to hide themselves; <hi>Pablo Fuentes</hi> going to shut up his house also to absent himselfe, I held him hard to it, striving with him that he might not escape away till some help came unto me. The <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi> when they came and saw me all in a blood, made furiously to <hi>Pablo Fuentes</hi> with their naked swords, whom I stopped desiring them not to hurt him, lest what harme they did unto him should be imputed unto me. I wished the Justice not to feare him though he were a rich <hi>Indian,</hi> and as they would answer before the President of <hi>Gua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temala</hi> to lay hold of him, and to carry him to prison, which they presently perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. I made the <hi>Spaniards</hi> and the Mulatta to witnesse under writing by way of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation what they had seen, what blood about my clothes, what wound in my hand, what blow in my mouth they had found, and sent with speed to the President of <hi>Guatemala</hi> this their information. The businesse was soon noised about the valley, whereupon most of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> came to offer their help and aid unto me<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Miguel Dalva</hi> also chancing to be neer at a <hi>Spaniards</hi> house in the same valley came with the rest, who would have done that night some mischief among the <hi>Indians</hi> if I had not prevented them. I desired them to depart and goe home to their houses, telling them I feared nothing, and that <hi>Miguel Dalva</hi> his company would be guard enough unto me. But they would by no meanes yeeld unto this, saying that night might prove more dangerous unto me then I imagined, and that I needed a stronger guard then of one man alone, for they conceived that the Idolaters knowing what already they had done, and fearing what grievous punishment might be inflicted upon them from the President of <hi>Guatemala,</hi> seeing themselves lost and undone men might desperately that night rescue their brother out of prison, and attempt some mischiefe against me, and so flie away. Which I could not be brought to fear, or to beleeve any such thing of their cowardly spirits, nor that they would flie away for that they had houses and land there in and about the Towne, yet I was willing for one night to yeeld to have a stronger guard of <hi>Spaniards</hi> then at other times I had had with the Blackmore <hi>Miguel Dalva</hi> alone. After supper they kept watch about my house till such time as they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived all was still, and the <hi>Indians</hi> a bed, and then they set a watch about the prison that <hi>Pablo Fuentes</hi> might not be taken out; and after this (pretending that they were in danger as wel as I being but about a dozen, if the Towne should all rise and mutiny by the suggestion of the Idolaters, who most of them were rich and powerfull with the rest, which yet I feared not) they would needs goe and raise up the two Alcaldes or Maiors alone, with two more pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

With this stir which they made, and their care of mee, they suffered me not to take any rest that night<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but went and called up the Alcaldes and two officers and brought them to my house, desiring me to signifie unto them, how fit and necessary it was to search for the rest of the <hi>Indians.</hi> The poore Alcaldes trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to see so many <hi>Spaniards</hi> at that time in my house with naked swords, and durst not but doe what they thought best to be done, and so from my house about midnight they walked about the Towne, searching such houses as they most suspected might conceale any of the <hi>Fuentes,</hi> or of the rest that had been that day in the rebellion and

mutiny against mee. They could find none at home, till at last comming to the house of one <hi>Lorenzo Fuentes,</hi> one of the brothers, they found all that had been in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiracy against mee, gathered together drinking and quaffing. The house being beset there was no flying nor escaping, and seeing the <hi>Spaniards</hi> naked swords, they durst not rebell, who doubtlesse (as wee were afterwards informed) would have made a great stirre in the Town that night, and were met together to rescue <hi>Pablo</hi> their bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and to doe mee some mischief and flye, not knowing that I was so strongly man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and guarded by the <hi>Spaniards.</hi> There were ten of them, and were presently without any noise in the Town carryed to the Prison, and there shut up, and guarded by the <hi>Spaniards.</hi>

               <p>In the morning the President of <hi>Guatemala</hi> (who then was <hi>Don Iuan de Guzman,</hi> a Religious Governour) taking into his consideration what the day before I had writ unto him, and judging my danger to bee great, sent a <hi>Spanish</hi> Alguazile, or Officer of Justice with a very large Commission to bring prisoners to the City all those <hi>Indians</hi> who the day before had been in rebellion against mee, and in case they could not bee found, then to seize upon what goods soever of theirs could be found in <hi>Mixco.</hi> But with the diligence of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> the night before they were all in a readinesse for him, and paying the Alguazile first his charges (which hee demanded as hee listed) and bearing the charges of <hi>Miguel Dalva,</hi> and two or three more <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who were commanded in the Kings Name to bee aiding and assisting the Officer for the safer carrying them to <hi>Guatemala,</hi> they were horsed and had away that day to the President, who committed them close Prisoners, and afterwards commanded them to be whipped about the streets, banished two of them from <hi>Mixco</hi> to the Golf of St. <hi>Thomas de Castilia,</hi> and would have banished them all, had they not humbled themselves, and desired mee to intercede for them, promising to amend their lives, and to make mee great satisfaction, if they might return again to their Town, and that if ever more they did stirre against mee, the would yeeld to be hanged and to lose al their goods. With this the President (fining them yet to pay twenty Crowns a peece to the Church to be imployed in what I should think fittest) sent them back; who, as they had promised, came unto mee, and humbled themselves before mee with much weeping, with many expressions, shewing their sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row from their hearts for what they had done, casting all upon the Devill, whom they confessed had been great with them in tempting them, whom also now they did ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure and renounce, promising to live as good Christians, and never more to worship any God but one. I was very much taken with their deepe sorrow expressed with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny tears, and indeavoured to instruct them in the true knowledge of Christ, whom now I found they were very willing to imbrace. I lived not very long after in that Towne; but for the time I did continue in it, I found a great change and alteration in their lives, which truly made mee apt to judge that their repentance was unfained. And these former particulars of a few <hi>Indians</hi> of those two Towns, I have not here inser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to bring an aspersion upon all that Nation, (which I doe very much affect, and would willingly spend the best drops of blood in my veines to doe them good, and to save their soules) but to cause rather pity and commiseration towards them, who after so many yeers preaching havebeen made as yet but formall and outward Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, and by the many Saints of wood, which they have been taught to worship by the Preist, have rather been inclined to the superstition and Idolatry of their Forefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and to trust to living Creatures, and bow to inanimate stocks and stones, which they daily see performed publickly in their Churches. Certainly they are of a good and flexible nature, and (were those Idols of Saints statues removed from their eyes) might bee brought easily to worship one onely God; and whereas they so willingly lavish out their small meanes and what they labour for, in offerings to the Preists and to their Saints, and in maintaining Lazy singing Lubbars, they without doubt would bee free enough to true Ministers of Gods Word, who should venture their lives to beat down those false Gods, and set up Jesus Christ, and him that sent him into the World to save such as truly beleeve in him.</p>
               <p>The yeere that this stirre happened in <hi>Mixco,</hi> I received from <hi>Rome</hi> from the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall of the Dominicans Order, License to come home to <hi>England;</hi> at which I rejoyced much, for now I was even weary with living among the <hi>Indians,</hi> &amp; grieved to see the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle fruit I reaped amongst them, and that for feare of the Inquisition I durst not preach a new Gospell unto them, which might make them true, reall, and inward Christians;
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:53246:95"/>
and lastly, for that I perceived that <hi>Antonio Mendez de Satomayor</hi> (who was Lord of the Towne of <hi>Mixco</hi>) did stomack me for having caused two of his Towne to bee banished, and publikely affronted the <hi>Fuentes</hi> for heir Idolatry, which hee thought was a great aspersion laid upon his <hi>Indians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All which well considered I writ unto the Provinciall (who was then in <hi>Chiapa</hi>) of my desire to returne home to mine owne Countrey, for the which I had a licence sent unto me from <hi>Rome.</hi> But he having heard of what good I had done in the Town of <hi>Mixco,</hi> in reducing some Idolaters, burning their idol, and venturing my life in so good a cause; and also for the perfect knowledge which now I had of the <hi>Poconcbi</hi> tongue, would by no meanes yeeld that I should go; but with fair and flattering words incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged me to stay, where he doubted not, but I did, and I might yet doe God much more good service; and that he might the better worke upon me, he sent a Patent of Vicar of the Towne and Cloister of <hi>Amatitlan,</hi> where at the present there was a new Cloister a building to separate all that valley from the Cloister of <hi>Guatemala.</hi> He de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired me to accept of that small preferment, not doubting but that I speaking so well the <hi>Indian</hi> language might prevaile much in that place, and better then another, fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the building of that new Cloister; which worke would be a good step for him to advance me afterwards to some better preferment. Although I regarded neither that present Superiority, nor any better honour which might afterwards ensue unto me, I thought the time which God had appointed for my returning to <hi>England</hi> was not yet come; for that if the Provinciall, and with him the President of <hi>Guatemala</hi> (for so much I conjectured out of the Provincialls letter) should both oppose and hinder my departure from that Countrey, it would be very hard for me to take my journey any way, and not be discovered and brought back. Whereupon I resolved to stay the Provincialls coming to <hi>Guatemala,</hi> and there to confer with him face<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap> to face, and to shew him some reasons that moved me to leave that Countrey, and to seek againe mine owne wherein I was borne. So for the present I accepted of the Towne of <hi>Amatitlan,</hi> where I had more occasions of getting mony than in the other two, where I had li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved five full yeers; for albeit that Towne alone was bigger then both <hi>Mixco</hi> and <hi>Pino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la</hi> together, and the Church fuller of Saints pictures and statues, and very many Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraternities and Sodalities belonged unto it; besides this from without the Towne I had great comings in from the Ingenio of Sugar, which I related before stood close un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that Towne, from whence I had dayly offerings from the <hi>Black-mores</hi> and <hi>Spaniards</hi> that lived in it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and besides this I had under my charge another lesser Towne called St. <hi>Christoval <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     </gap>a,</hi> from the high and upright standing rock, from whence the water falleth. In this Towne there are many rich <hi>Indians,</hi> who trade in the coast of the South sea; the Towne is as an harbour shadowed with many fruitfull trees; but the chief fruit here is the Pinn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>, which groweth in every <hi>Indians</hi> yard, and with the neernesse of the Ingenio of Sugar, are by the <hi>Spaniards</hi> therea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouts much made up in Preserves, some whole, some in slices, which is the daintiest and most luscious<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Preserve that I ever did eat in that Countrey. The <hi>Indians</hi> of this Towne get much by boards of Cedar, which they cut out of many Cedar-trees, which grow on that side of the Vulcan, which they sell to <hi>Guatemala</hi> and all about the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey for new buildings.</p>
               <p>Between great <hi>Amatitlan</hi> and this Town the way is plain, and lieth under a Vulcan of fire, which formerly was wont to smoak as much as that of <hi>Guatemala;</hi> but having for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly burst out at the top, and there opened a great mouth, &amp; cast down to the bottome mighty stones (which to this day are to be seen) it hath not since been any waies trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blesome unto the Countrey. In this way there was in my time a new Trapiche of Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar erecting up by one <hi>Iohn Baptista</hi> of <hi>Guatemala,</hi> which was thought would prove very usefull, and profitable unto the foresaid City. I had yet for the time that I lived
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:53246:96"/>
in <hi>Amatitlan</hi> another very little village at my charge, called <hi>Pampichi</hi> at the bottome of a high mountaine on the other side of the lake over against, which was but a Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell of ease unto great <hi>Amatitlan,</hi> unto which I went not above once in a quarter of a yeer, and that for pastime and recreation; for this village is well in that language a compound also of <hi>Pam,</hi> in, and <hi>Pichi,</hi> flowers, for that it standeth compassed about with flowers, which make it very pleasant, and the boats or Canoa's which doe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly stand neer the doores of the houses, invites to much pleasure of fishing and row<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about the lake.</p>
               <p>And thus whilst I lived in <hi>Amatitlan</hi> I had the choice of three places wherein to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>create my selfe, and because the charge of many soules lay in my hands, I had one constantly to help me. The Towne of <hi>Amatitlan</hi> was as the Court in respect of the rest, where nothing was wanting that might recreate the mind and satisfie the body with variety and change of sustenance, both for fish and flesh. Yet the great care that did lie upon me in the worke and building of the Cloister, made me very soone weary of living in that great and pleasant Towne; for sometimes I had thirty, sometimes twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, sometimes fewer, and sometimes fourty worke-men to looke unto, and to pay wages to on Saturday nights, which I found wearied much my braine, and hindred my studies, and was besides a worke which I delighted not in, nor had any hopes ever to enjoy it. And therefore after the first yeer that I had been there I betooke my selfe unto the Provinciall, who was in <hi>Guatemala,</hi> and againe earnestly besought him to peruse the Licence which I had from <hi>Rome</hi> to goe to <hi>England</hi> mine owne Countrey for to preach there (for that was the chiefe ground of letting me goe home, as the Generall largely expressed) where I doubted not but I might doe God great service, and in Conscience I told him I thought I was bound to employ what parts God had bestowed upon me, rather upon my own Countreymen, then upon <hi>Indians</hi> and stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers. The Provinciall replyed unto me that my Countrey men were Heretickes, and when I came amongst them they would hang me up. I told him, I hoped better things of them, and that I would not behave my selfe among them so as to deserve hanging, not daring to tell him what was in my heart concerning points of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. After a long discourse I found the Provinciall inexorable, and halfe angry, tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling me that he and that whole Province had cast their eyes upon me, and honoured me, and were ready and willing to promote me further, and that I would shew my selfe very ungratefull unto them, if I should forsake them for my owne nation and people, whom I had not knowne from my young and tender age. I perceived there was no more to be said, and all would be in vaine, and so resolved to take my best op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, and with my Licence from <hi>Rome</hi> to come away unknowne unto him. But for the present I humbly beseeched him to remove me from <hi>Amatitlan,</hi> for that I found my selfe unable to undergoe that great charge, and too weake for that strong worke, that was then building. With much adoe he would be brought to this, alleadging what an honour it was to be a Founder and builder of a new Cloister, in whose walls my very name would be engraven to posterity; all which I told him I regarded not, but estemed more of my health and a quiet mind, then of such preferments and vanities. Upon which at last he condescended to my request, and gave me order to goe to <hi>Peta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pa,</hi> and that the Vicar of <hi>Petapa</hi> should goe to finish the worke of <hi>Amatitlan.</hi> In <hi>Petapa</hi> I lived above a twelve moneth, with great ease, pleasure and content for all things worldly and outward; but within I had still a worme of Conscience, gnawing this gourd that shadowed and delighted me with worldly contentment. Here I grew more and more troubled concerning some points of Religion, dayly wishing with <hi>David,</hi> that I had the wings of a Dove, that I might flie from that place of dayly Idolatry into <hi>England,</hi> and be at rest. I resolved therefore to put on a good courage, and relie wholly upon my God, knowing that the journey was hard and dangerous, and might bring shame and trouble unto me, if I should be taken in the way flying and brought back to <hi>Guatemala;</hi> here I weighed the affliction and reproach which might ensue un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me, after so much honor, pleasure, and wealth which I had enjoyed for about twelve yeers in that Countrey; but in another balance of better consideration, I weighed the trouble of a wounded Conscience, and the spirituall joy and comfort that I might en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy at home with the people of God, and so resolutely concluded upon that place of <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 25, 26, 27. with <hi>Moses,</hi> to choose rather to suffer affliction with the people of God (who as <hi>Paul</hi> well observeth, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

I thought this was a businesse not to be conferred with flesh and blood, lest the best friend knowing of it should betray me; yet on the other side, I thought it hard to flie alone without some friend for the first two or three daies journey; and besides having many things to sell away to make mony of, I thought I were better to imploy some trusty friend, then to doe all alone. I thought of none fitter then <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guel Dalva,</hi> whom by long experience I knew to be true and trusty, and that a small mony matter would content him; whom I sent for to <hi>Pinola,</hi> and charging him with secrecy, I told him I had a journey for my conscience sake to make to <hi>Rome</hi> (I would not tell him that I intended <hi>England,</hi> lest the good old <hi>Black-more</hi> should grieve think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing never more to see me, and for the love he bare me, and interest he had many times from me, he should by discovering my intent, seek to stop me) which I would have none to know of but himselfe, not doubting but to returne againe, as he know many had taken the like journey, and returned within two yeers.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Black-more</hi> offered himselfe to goe with me, which I refused, telling him that the seas would be too hard for his old age to endure, and that as a <hi>Black-more</hi> in foraine Countries he might be stopped and apprehended for a fugitive; which reason he liked well, and offered himselfe to goe with mee as farre as the sea side; for which I thanked him and employed to sell me away some Mules, Wheat, and Maiz which I had, and what else might well passe through his hands. As for many rich pictures which hung in my chamber, I thought the Towne of <hi>Petapa</hi> would buy them for their Church, and propounded it unto the Governour, who willingly accepted of them. Most of my bookes, chests, cabinets, quilts, and many good peices of houshold-stuffe, by the paines and industry of <hi>Miguel</hi> (whom I kept with me for the space of two moneths before I came away) I sold to <hi>Guatemala,</hi> reserving onely two Petaca's or leatherne chests, with some bookes and a quilt for my journey. When I had sold all that I intended, I found I had in <hi>Spanish</hi> mony neer nine thousand peeces of eight, which I had got in twelve yeers that I lived in that Country. So much mony I thought would be too combersome for a long journey; whereupon I turned above four thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand of them into pearles and some pretious stones, which might make my carriage the lighter; the rest I laid up some in bags, some I sowed into my quilt, intending in the way to turne them into <hi>Spanish</hi> Pistols. Thus the chiefe provision being made of mony, I tooke care for Chocolatte and some Conserves for the way, which were soon provided. Now because I considered that my flight the first week must be with speed, and that my chests could not post day and night as my selfe intended to doe; I thought of sending my carriage four dayes at least before me; and not daring to trust any <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian</hi> of <hi>Petapa,</hi> I sent to <hi>Mixco</hi> for one speciall <hi>Indian</hi> friend whom I had there, who knew the way that I was to travaile very well; to whom I opened my mind, and offered what mony I knew would well content him, and at midnight sent him away with two Mules, one for himselfe, and another for my chests, wishing him to keep on travelling towards <hi>St. Miguel,</hi> or <hi>Nicaragua</hi> till I overtooke him. I gave him the advantage of four daies and nights, and then resolutely with my good <hi>Blackmore</hi> in my company leaving the key of my chamber in my doore, and nothing but old papers within, when all the <hi>Indians</hi> where fast sleep<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He chiefe thing which troubled me in my resolved purpose to come home, was the choice of the safest way; which made me utterly forsake the Gulfe (though the easiest way of all, and that sea neerest to the place where I lived) for that I knew I should meet there with many of my acquaintance, and the setting out of the ships was so uncertain, that before they departed, order might come from <hi>Guate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mala</hi> to stop me; if I should go by land through <hi>Comayagua</hi> to <hi>Truxillo,</hi> and there wait for the ships, likewise I feared lest the Governour of that place by some item from the President of <hi>Guatemala</hi> might examine me, and send me backe, and that the Masters of the ships might have charge given them not to receive me into their ships. If I should goe backe to <hi>Mexico</hi> and <hi>Vera Cruz,</hi> then I called to mind, how I was troubled in that long journey, when I came first to <hi>Chiapa</hi> in company of friends, and that now alone I should certainly be much put to it, for I would carry <hi>Miguel Dalva</hi> so far by land with me. Wherefore rejecting these three wayes, I chose the fourth, which was by <hi>Nicaragua</hi> and the Lake of <hi>Granada;</hi> and therefore I deferred my journey till the week after <hi>Christ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas,</hi> knowing that the time of the frigats setting out from that lake to the <hi>Havana</hi> was commonly after the middle of <hi>Ianuary,</hi> or at <hi>Candlemas</hi> at the furthest, whither I ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped to reach in very good time. Now that I might by no means be suspected to have taken this way; before I went I left by the hand of <hi>Miguel Dalva</hi> a letter to a friend of his to be delivered to the Provinciall in <hi>Guatemala,</hi> foure dayes after my departure, wherein I kindly tooke my leave of him, desiring him not to blame me nor to seeke after me; and whereas I had a sufficient Licence from <hi>Rome,</hi> and could not get his, that I thought I might with a safe Conscience goe where I was born, leaving Linguists e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to supply my place amongst the <hi>Indians.</hi> And because he should not make en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry after me by <hi>Nicaragua,</hi> I dated and subscribed my letter to him from the Towne of <hi>St. Antonio Su<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>This Towne of <hi>los Esclavos</hi> standeth in a bottome by a river, over the which the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi> have built a very strong stone Bridge to goe in and out of the Town, for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise with mules there is no passing by reason of the violent and rapid streame of the water, and many rocks in the River, from which the water falleth down with great force. From this Town (where wee onely stayed to drink a cup of Chocolatte and to bait our mules) wee went on that day to <hi>Aguachapa,</hi> being ten leagues further, and not farre from the South Sea, and the port called <hi>De la Trinidad;</hi> whither wee came towards Evening, having that day and part of the night travelled about threescore <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish</hi> miles up hils, and upon stony wayes from the <hi>Esclavo's</hi> unto this Town; which is much mentioned in that Country for two things. The one is for the earthen ware which is made there (as some think) exceeding that of <hi>Mixco.</hi> The other is for a place within a mile and a halfe from the Town, which the <hi>Spaniards</hi> doe credibly report and beleeve to be a mouth of hell. For out of it there is constantly ascending a thick black smoak smelling of Brimstone, with some flashes now and then of fire; the earth from whence this smoak ariseth is not high, but low. None ever durst draw nigh to find out the truth and ground of it; for those that have attempted to doe it, have been stricken down to the ground and like to lose their lives. A friend of mine a Fryer (whom I thought verily I might beleeve) upon his oath affirmed unto me, that travelling that way with a Provinciall hee resolved to goe unto the place, and satisfie himselfe of the ground and cause of the strange talke which was every where about the Country concerning that smoke. He went within a quarter of a mile of it, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently, hee said, he heard a hideous noise, which together with the stench of the fiery smoke and brimstone, struck him into such a fear that he was like to fall to the ground, and retiring himself back with all speed was taken with a burning Feaver, which was like to cost him his life. Others report that drawing neer unto it, they have heard great cries as it were of men and women in torment, noise of iron, of chaines, and the like, which (how simply I leave it to my Judicious Reader) maketh them beleeve that it is a mouth of hell. Of my knowledge I will say no more, but that I saw the smoke, and asked the <hi>Indians</hi> what was the cause of it; and if ever they had been neer unto it? And they answered mee, that they could not imagine what might bee the cause of it, neither durst they draw nigh unto it; and that they had seen Travellers, attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to goe neere it, and that they were all stricken either to the ground, or with some suddaine amazement, or Feaver. I told them that I would walke thither my self, and they desired mee that I would not, if I loved my life. It was not yet for all this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the feare of being so neer the <hi>Spaniards</hi> hell (as they call it) that made me haste with speed out of that Town, but fear of some messenger that might come after mee to stop my journy. For at midnight I departed from thence, and went to breake my fast to a great Town called <hi>Chalchuapan,</hi> where the <hi>Indians</hi> made very much of mee, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Pocomanes,</hi> who spake the <hi>Poconchi</hi> or <hi>Pocoman</hi> tongue which I had learned. They would willingly have had me to stay with them and preach unto them the next Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, which I would have done, had not a better designe called upon mee to make haste.</p>
               <p>Here I was troubled, how I should get through St. <hi>Salvador,</hi> which was a City of <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and wherein there was a Cloister of Dominicans, whom I feared most of all, because I was known by some of them. My resolution was therefore when I came neere unto the City, to turn out of my way to a <hi>Spaniards</hi> Farm as if I had lost my way, and there to delay the time till Evening in drinking Chocolatte, discoursing, and baiting my mules well, that so I might travell all that night, and bee out of the reach of that City, and Fryers (who lived in <hi>Indian</hi> Towns about it) the next morning, early. This City of St. <hi>Salvador</hi> is poore, not much bigger then <hi>Chiapa,</hi> and is go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned by a <hi>Spanish</hi> Governour. It standeth forty leagues at least from <hi>Guatemala,</hi> and towards the North Sea side, is compassed with very high mountaines, which are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Chuntales, where the <hi>Indians</hi> are very poore. In the bottome where the City stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth there are some Trabiches of Sugar, some Indigo made, but the chief Farmes are
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:53246:98"/>
Estancia's of Cattell. Towards Evening I departed from that Farm where I had well refreshed my selfe and my Mule, and about eight of the clock I rid through the City not being known by any body. My purpose was to bee the next morning at a great River, called <hi>Rio de Lempa,</hi> some ten leagues from St. <hi>Salvador,</hi> for within two leagues of it there lived in an <hi>Indian</hi> Town a Fryer belonging to the Cloister of St. <hi>Salvador</hi> who knew mee very well. But such haste I made that before break of the day I passed thuough that Town, and before seven of the clock I was at the River, where I found my <hi>Indian</hi> of <hi>Mixco</hi> ready to passe over with my carriage, who that morning by three of the clock had set out of that Town two leagues off. I was not a little glad to have overtaken my Chests, wherein was most of my treasure. There I sate down a while by the River whilst my mules grazed, and my <hi>Indian</hi> struck fire and made me Chocolatte. This River of <hi>Lempa</hi> is held the broadest, and biggest in all the Jurisdiction belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto <hi>Guatemala;</hi> there are constantly two Ferry Boats to passe over the Travellers, and their Requa's of Mules. This River is privileged in this manner, that if a man commit any hainous crime or murther on this side of <hi>Guatemala,</hi> and <hi>San Salvador,</hi> or on the other side of St. <hi>Miguel,</hi> or <hi>Nicaragua,</hi> if hee can flie to get over this River, he is free as long as hee liveth on the other side, and no Justice on that side whither hee is escaped can question or trouble him for the murther committed. So likewise for Debts hee cannot bee arrested. Though I thanked God I neither fled for the one, or for the other, yet it was my comfort that I was now going over to a priviledged Country, where I hoped I should bee free and sure, and that if any one did come after mee, hee would goe no further then to the River of <hi>Lempa.</hi> My Blackmore did much laugh at this my conceipt, and warranted mee that all would doe well. Wee Ferried safely over the River; and from thence went in company with my <hi>Indian</hi> to a little small Towne of <hi>Indians</hi> two leagues off, where wee made the best dinner that we had done from the Towne of <hi>Petapa,</hi> and willingly gave rest to all our mules till foure of the clocke in the afternoone; at which time wee set forth to another small Town little above two leagues off, through a plain, sandy, and Champaigne Country. The next day wee had but ten leagues to travaile to a Town called St. <hi>Miguel,</hi> which belongeth unto <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and though it bee not a City, yet is as bigge almost as <hi>San Salvador,</hi> and hath a <hi>Spanish</hi> Governour; in it there is one Cloister of Nuns, and another of Merce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narian Fryers, who welcomed mee unto their Cloister; for here I began to shew my face, and to think of felling away the Mule I rid on, being resolved from hence to goe by water or an Arm of the Sea, to a Town in <hi>Nicaragua</hi> called <hi>La Vieja.</hi> I would here have dismissed my <hi>Indian,</hi> but hee was loth to leave me untill I got to <hi>Granada,</hi> where hee desired to see mee shipped. I refused not his kind offer, because I knew hee was trusty and had brought my Chests well thither, and knew well the way to <hi>Granada.</hi> So I sent him by land to <hi>Realejo,</hi> or to <hi>La Vieja,</hi> which stand very neere together and thirty leagues by land from St. <hi>Miguel,</hi> and my self stayed that day and till the next day at noon in that Town, where I sold the mule, I rid on, because I knew that from <hi>Realojo</hi> to <hi>Granada</hi> I could have of the <hi>Indians</hi> a Mule for nothing for a dayes journey. My Black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mores mule I sent also by land with the <hi>Indian,</hi> and the next day went to the Gulfe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing three or foure miles from St. <hi>Miguel,</hi> where that afternoone I tooke Boat with many other passenger<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>, and the next morning by eight in the morning was at <hi>La Vieja,</hi> which journey by land would have taken mee up neere three dayes. The next day my <hi>Indian</hi> came at night, and wee went to <hi>Realejo,</hi> (as I have observed before) a Haven very weak and unfortified on the South Sea; where if I would have stayed one fort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night I might have taken shipping for <hi>Panama,</hi> to goe from thence to <hi>Portabelo,</hi> and there stay for the Galeons from <hi>Spain.</hi> But I considered that the Galeons would not be here till <hi>Iune</hi> or <hi>July,</hi> and that so I should be at great charges in staying so long. But afterwards I wished I had accepted of that occasion, for I was at last forced to goe to <hi>Panama,</hi> and <hi>Portabelo.</hi> From hence to <hi>Granada</hi> I observed nothing, but the plainnesse and pleasantnesse of the way, which with the fruits and fertility of all things may well make <hi>Nicaragua</hi> the Paradise of <hi>America.</hi> Betweene <hi>Realejo</hi> and <hi>Granada</hi> standeth the City of <hi>Leon,</hi> neere unto a <hi>Vulcan</hi> of fire, which formerly burst out at the top, and did much hurt unto all the Country about; but since that it hath ceased, and now letteth the Inhabitants live without feare. Sometimes it smokes a little, which shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that as yet there is within some sulphurous substance.</p>
               <p>Here it was that a Mercenarian Fryer thought to have discovered some great treasure,

which might inrich himselfe and all that Country, being fully perswaded that the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall that burned within that <hi>Vul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

But such was the power and strength of the fire within, that no sooner had hee let downe the Kettle, when it fell from the chain and from his hands being melted away.</p>
               <p>This City of <hi>Leon</hi> is very curiously built, for the chief delight of the Inhabitants consisteth in their houses, and in the pleasure of the Country adjoyning, and in the abundance of all things for the life of man, more then in any extraordinary riches, which there are not so much injoyed, as in other parts of <hi>America.</hi> They are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with fine gardens, with variety of singing birds, and parrets, with plenty of fish and flesh, which is cheap, and with gay houses, and so lead a delicious, lazy and idle life; not aspiring much to trade and traffique, though they have neer unto them the Lake, which commonly every yeere sendeth forth some Frigats to <hi>Havana</hi> by the North Sea, and <hi>Realejo</hi> on the South Sea, which to them might bee very commodious for any dealing and rich Trading in <hi>Per<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

From hence the way is plain and Levell to <hi>Granada,</hi> whither I got safely and joyfully, hoping that now I had no more journey to make by land, till I should land at <hi>Dover</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> and from thence post up to <hi>London.</hi> Two dayes after I had arrived at this place <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

The former Requa's I feared not; but the latter made me keep close within my lodging, lest going abroad, I should be knowne by some of those that came from <hi>Guatemala;</hi> who after they had delivered what they brought, presently departed, and with their departure set mee at liberty, who for their sakes was a voluntary prisoner within mine owne lodging. But fearing lest more of these Requa's might come and affright mee, I went to a Towne out of the rode, a league from <hi>Granada,</hi> and took my pleasure up and downe the Countrey where I was much feasted by the Mercenarian Friers, who enjoy most of those Towns. Amongst these I heard much of the passage in the frigots to <hi>Carthagena,</hi> which did not a little dishearten and discourage me. For although, whilst they saile upon the Lake, they goe securely and without trouble, yet when they fall from the Lake to the river (which there they call <hi>El Desaguadero</hi>) to goe out to the Sea, <hi>hic labor, hoc opus est,</hi> here is nothing but trouble, which sometimes makes that short voyage to last two moneths; for such is the fall of the waters in many places amongst the rockes, that many times they are forced to unlade the frigots, and lade them again with helpe of Mules which are there kept for that purpose, by a few <hi>Indians</hi> that live about the river, and have care of the Lodges made for to lay in the wares, whilest the frigots passe thorow those dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous places to another Lodge, whither the wares are brought by Mules, and put a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine into the frigots. Beside this trouble (which must needs be tedious to a pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senger, to be thus stopped, who would willingly come soone to his journeys end) the abundance of gnats is such, which make <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Though all this was terrible to me to hear, yet I comforted my selfe that my life was in the hands of the Lord, and that the frigots did commonly every yeer passe that way, and seldome any were lost. I went now and then to <hi>Granada</hi> to bargaine for my pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage, and to know when the frigots would for certaine set out, and to provide my selfe of some dainties and Chocolatte for my journey, having agreed with a Master of a frigot for my diet at his table. The time was appointed within foure or five dayes; but suddainly all was crossed with a strict command from <hi>Guatemala,</hi> that the frigots should not goe out that yeer, because the President and whole Court was informed for certaine that some <hi>English</hi> or <hi>Holland ships</hi> was abroad at sea, and lay about the mouth of the river or <hi>Desaguadero</hi> waiting for the frigots of <hi>Granada,</hi> and that the said were sometimes lurking about the Islands of <hi>St. Iohn,</hi> and <hi>St. Catharine</hi> (which then was our <hi>Providence</hi>) which made all the Merchants of the Countrey to feare and sweat with a cold sweat, and the President to be carefull for the Kings revenues, left the losse of them should be imputed to his wilfull negligence, in stopping the frigots, whilst he might, and had warning given. This was but sad newes unto me, who knew not for the present, which way to dispose of myselfe. I began to thinke of the ship that was at <hi>Realejo</hi> ready to set out to <hi>Panama,</hi> thinking that would now be my best course, but enquiring after it, I was for certaine informed by some Merchants that it was newly gone. Then my eyes looked upon <hi>Comayagua</hi> and <hi>Truxillo,</hi> and upon the ships of <hi>Honduras,</hi> but these were but vaine and troubled thoughts, arising from a perplexed heart, for the ships were also gone from thence, without some small vessell or frigot might be there with newes from <hi>Havana</hi> or <hi>Carthagena</hi> (for those places send often word and notice of what ships are abroad at sea) but this also was a mee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Whereupon my perplexity more and more increased; onely my comfort was that there were more passengers besides my selfe, who I knew must take some course, and whom I also resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to follow by sea, or land. Amongst us all we were once resolving to hire a frigot to carry us onely to <hi>Carthagena,</hi> but this would not bee granted, for no body would hazard his vessel and life for our sakes. Whilest we were thus distressed and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed enquiring about <hi>Granada</hi> of the Merchants what course we might take to get to <hi>Spaine</hi> that yeer, or to meet with the <hi>Havana</hi> or <hi>Carthagena,</hi> one that wished us well,

counselled us to goe to <hi>Costarica,</hi> where at <hi>Carthago</hi> we should be sure to hear of some vessels bound for <hi>Portobel,</hi> either from the river called <hi>de los Anzuelos,</hi> or from the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver called <hi>Suere,</hi> from whence every yeer went outsome small frigots to carry Meale, Bacon, Fowles, and other provision for the Galeons to <hi>Portobel.</hi> This we thought was a hard and difficult, and of neer a hundred and fifty leagues, over mountaines and through desarts, where we should misse the pleasure, variety, and dainties of <hi>Gua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temala</hi> and <hi>Nicaragua,</hi> and after all this peradventure might misse of an opportunity of any frigot bound to <hi>Portobelo.</hi> Yet so unwilling were we all to returne to <hi>Guatema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la</hi> from whence we came, that we would rather go forward, and undergoe any difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, so that at last we might find any shipping to convey us where we might meet with the Galeons, which we knew were not to come to <hi>P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

They had each of them (as my selfe had) carriage for one Mule, and none to ride on; but thought it their best way to buy each of them a Mule to carry them, which they hoped after their journey to sell againe at <hi>Costarica,</hi> and to get mony by them, and for their carriages to hire Mules and <hi>Indians</hi> from Towne to Towne, who also might serve to guide us through many dangerous places and passages, which we understood were in the way. Now I wished I had my Mule which I sold at <hi>San Miguel,</hi> or any one of the two which I sold before in <hi>Grana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da.</hi> But for my mony I doubtednot, with the helpe of my <hi>Black-more,</hi> but I should find one for my purpose. I furnished my selfe very speedily, for fifty peeces of eight, of one which I feared not would performe my journey. My good and trusty <hi>Black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more</hi> would willingly have gone o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>Thus with one <hi>Indian</hi> to guide us we set four of us out of <hi>Granada,</hi> enjoying for the two first daies more of the pleasure of that <hi>Mahomets</hi> paradise <hi>Nicaragua,</hi> finding the way for the most part plain, the Townes pleasant, the Countrey shady, and every where fruits abounding. The second day after we set out, we were much affrighted with a huge and monstrous Caiman or Crocodile, which having come out of the Lake (which we passed by) and lying crosse a puddle of water bathing himselfe, and waiting for some prey, as we perceived after, whom we not knowing well at the first, but thinking that it had been some tree that was felled or fallen, passed close by it; when on a suddain we knew the scales of the Cayman, and saw the monster stir and move, and set himself against us; wherewith we made hast from him; but he thinking to have made some of us his greedy prey, ran after us, which when we perceived, and that he was like to overtake us, we were much troubled, untill one of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> (who knew better the nature &amp; quality of that beast then the rest) called upon us to turn on one side out of the way, and to ride on straight for a while, and then to turn on another side<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and so to circumflex our way, which advice of his without doubt saved mine, or some of the others lives, for thus we wearied that mighty monster and escaped from him, who (had we rid out straightway) had certainly overtaken us, and killed some mule or man, for his straight forward flight was as swift as our Mules could run; but whilst he turned, and wheeled about his heavy body, we got ground and advantage till we left him far behind us; and by this experience we came to know the nature and quality of that beast, whose greatnesse of body is no hinderance to run forward as swift as a Mule; but otherwise, as the Elephant once laid down is troubled to get up, so this monster is heavy and stiffe, and therefore much troubled to turne and wind about his body. We praised God who had that day delivered us, and riding for a while by the side of the lake, we were watchful that we might not fall again into the like danger. But the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of this lake of <hi>Granada</hi> may from hence be knowne, in that the second and third day of our journey, being at least threescore miles from whence we set out, we now and then found our way lying by it. After that wee had wholly lost the sight of it, we began to enter into rough and craggy wayes, declining more to the South then to the North sea. And in all the rest of our journey to <hi>Carthago,</hi> we observed nothing worth committing to posterity, but onely mighty woods and trees on the South sea fide, very fit for to make strong ships, and many mountaines and desert pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, where we lay sometimes two nights together, either in woods or open fields, far
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:53246:100"/>
from any Town or habitation of <hi>Indians,</hi> yet for our comfort in these so desert places we had stil a guide with us, and found lodges, which by the command of the neerest Justices had been set up for such as travelled that way. We came at last through thousand dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to the city of <hi>Carthago,</hi> which we found not to be so poor as in richer places, as <hi>Gua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temala</hi> and <hi>Nicaragna</hi> it was reported to be. For there we had occasion to inquire after some Merchants for exchange of gold and silver, and wee found that some were very rich, who traded by Land and Sea with <hi>Panama,</hi> and by Sea with <hi>Portobelo, Cartha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gena,</hi> and <hi>Havana,</hi> and from thence with <hi>Spain.</hi> This City may consist of foure hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Families, and is governed by a <hi>Spanish</hi> Governour; It is a Bishops Sea, and hath in it three Cloisters, two of Fryers, and one of Nuns. Here wee began to enquire af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that which had brought us through so many Mountaines, Woods and deserts, to wit, after some speedy occasion of shipping our selves for <hi>Portobelo</hi> or <hi>Carthagena;</hi> and according to our desires wee understood of one Frigat almost ready to set out from the River called <hi>De los Anzuelos,</hi> and another from the River <hi>Suere;</hi> and being well in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed that <hi>Suere</hi> would bee the best place for us to Travaile unto by reason of more provision in the way, more Towns of <hi>Indians,</hi> and Estancia's of <hi>Spaniards,</hi> we resolved within foure dayes after wee had rested in <hi>Carthago,</hi> to undertake a new journey towards the North Sea. Wee found that Country mountainous in many places, yet here and there some Valleys where was very good corn, <hi>Spaniards</hi> living in good Farmes, who as well as the <hi>Indians</hi> bred many hogs; but the Townes of <hi>Indians</hi> we found much unlike to those which wee had left behind in <hi>Nicaragua</hi> and <hi>Guatemala;</hi> and the people in curtesie and clvility much differing from them, and of a rude and bold carriage and behaviour towards us; yet they are kept under by the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> as much as those whom I have formerly spoken of about <hi>Gnatemala.</hi> Wee came in so good a time to the River <hi>Suere,</hi> that wee stayed there but three dayes in a <hi>Spanish</hi> Farm neere unto it, and departed.</p>
               <p>The Master of the Frigat was exceeding glad of our company, and offered to carry mee for nothing, but for my prayers to God for him, and for a safe passage; which hee hoped would not bee above three or four daies sailing. What hee carried was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but some Hony, Hides, Bacon, meal and fowles. The greatest danger he told us of, was the setting out from the River, (which runs in some places with a very strong stream, is shallow and full of rocks in other places) till wee come forth to the maine Sea. Whither we got out safely and had not sailed on above twenty leagues, when we discovered two ships making towards us; our hearts began to quake, and the Master himselfe of the Frigat wee perceived was not without feare, who suspected that they were <hi>English,</hi> or <hi>Holland</hi> Ships; wee had no guns nor weapons to fight with, save one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly foure or five Muskets and half a dozen Swords; wee thought the wings of our nim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Frigat might be our best comfort, and flying away our chiefest safety. But this comfort soon began to fail us, and our best safety was turned into neer approaching danger; for before wee could flie on five leagues towards <hi>Portobel,</hi> wee could from our Top Mast easily perceive the two Ships to be <hi>Hollanders,</hi> and too nimble for our little Vessell, which presently one of them (which being a Man of Warre, was too much and too strong for our weaknesse) fetcht up, and with a thundring Message made us strike Saile. Without any fighting wee durst not but yeeld, hoping for better mercy. But O what sed thoughts did here run to and fro my dejected heart, which was struck down lower then our Saile? How did I sometimes look upon Deaths frighting visage? But if again I would comfort and incourage my selfe against this feare of Death; how then did I begin to see an end of all my hopes of ever more returning to my wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed and desired Country?

My further thoughts were soone interrupted by the <hi>Hollanders</hi> who came abord our Frigat with more speed then wee desired. Though their Swords, Muskets and Pistols did not a little terrifie, yet wee were somewhat comforted, when wee understood who was their chief Captaine
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:53246:100"/>
and Commander, and hoped for more mercy from him, who had been born and brought up amongst <hi>Spaniards,</hi> then from the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> who as they were little bound unto the <hi>Spanish</hi> Nation for mercy, so did wee expect little from them. The Captain of this <hi>Holland</hi> Ship which took us was a Mulatto, born and bred in <hi>Havana,</hi> whose Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I saw and spoke with afterwards that same yeer, when the Galeons struck into that Port to expect there the rest that were to come from <hi>Vera Cruz.</hi> This Mulatto for some wrongs which had been offered unto him from some commanding <hi>Spaniards</hi> in the <hi>Havana,</hi> ventured himself desperately in a boat out to the Sea, where were some <hi>Holland</hi> Ships waiting for a prize, and with Gods helpe getting unto them, yeelded himself to their mercy, which hee esteemed farre better then that of his own Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, promising to serve them faithfully against his owne Nation, which had most in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juriously and wrongfully abused, yea and (as I was afterwards informed) whipped him in the <hi>Havana.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Mulatto proved so true and faithfull in his good services unto the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> that they esteemed mnch of him, marryed him to one of their Nation, and made him Captain of a Ship under that brave and gallant <hi>Hollander</hi> whom the <hi>Spaniards</hi> then so much feared, and named, <hi>Pie de Palo,</hi> or Woodden Leg. This famous Mulatto it was that with his Sea Souldiers borded our Frigat, in the which hee had found little worth his labour, had it not been for the <hi>Indians</hi> offerings which I carryed with mee, of which I lost that day the worth of four thousand Patacons or peeces of eight in pearles, and pretious stones, and neer three thousand more in money. The other <hi>Spaniards</hi> lost some hundreds a peece, which was so rich a prize, that it made the <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers</hi> stomach loath the rest of our grosse provision of Bacon, Meale and Fowles, and our money tasted sweeter unto them, then the Hony which our Frigat also afforded them. Other things I had (as a Quilt to lie on, some Bookes, and Lamina's, which are pictures in brasse, and clothes) which I begged of that Noble Captaine the Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latto, who considering my Orders and calling, gave mee them freely, and wished me to bee patient, saying that hee could doe no otherwise then he did with my mony and Pearles, and using that common Proverbe at Sea, <hi>Oy por mi, manana por ti,</hi> to day fortune hath been for mee, tomorrow it may bee for thee: or to day I have got what tomorrow I may lose again. Here I made use also of that common saying, that i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

I confesse, though it was very crosse to flesh and blood, yet I found an inward spirituall strengthning from above, and to be very true what <hi>Panl</hi> writes to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> in the 12 Chapter, and Verse 11. saying, <hi>No chastening for the present seemeth to bee joyous, but grievous; neverthelesse afterward it yeeldeth the peaceable fruit of righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse unto them which are exercised thereby:</hi> for that very day I found my inward man quiet and peaceable with a full and totall submission unto the holy will of God, which I desired might bec done in earth, in the Sea, and performed and obeyed by me at that present, as it is alwayes done in heaven. And although this was my best and chief comfort, yet from the creature by the Creators permission I had also some com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort left in a few pistols, some single, some double, which I had sowed up in my Quilt (which the Captain restored unto mee, saying it was the bed I lay in) and in the doublet which I had at that present, which mounted to almost a thousand Crownes, and in their searching was not found out. After the Captain and Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers had well viewed their prize, they thought of refreshing their stomacks with some of our provision; the good Captaine made a stately dinner in our Frigat, and invited mee unto it, and knowing that I was going towards the <hi>Havana,</hi> besides many other brindi's or healths, hee drank oneunto his mother, desiring mee to see her, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member him unto her, and how that for her sake hee had used mee well and courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously in what hee could; and further at Table hee said that for my sake hee would give us our Frigat that wee might return again to land, and that I might find out from thence some safer way and means to get to <hi>Portobels,</hi> &amp; to continue on my journey un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Spain.</hi> After dinner I conferred with the Captain alone, and told him that I was no <hi>Spaniard,</hi> but an <hi>English</hi> man born, shewing him the Licence which I had from <hi>Rome</hi> to
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:53246:101"/>
goe to <hi>England,</hi> and that therefore I hoped, not being of an enemy nation to the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> he would restore unto me what goods were mine. But all this was of lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle consequence with him, who had already taken possession of mine, and all other goods in the ship: he told me, I must suffer with those, amongst whom I was found, and that I might as wel claime all the goods in the ship for mine. I desired him then to carry me along with him to <hi>Holland,</hi> that from thence I might get to <hi>England,</hi> which also he refused to doe, telling me that he went about from one place to another, and knew not when he should goe to <hi>Holland,</hi> and that he was daily ready to fight with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>Spanish</hi> ship, and if he should fight with the <hi>Spaniards</hi> whilst I was in his ship, his souldiers in their hot blood might be ready to doe me a mischiefe, thinking I would doe them harm, if in fight they should be taken by the <hi>Spaniards.</hi> With these his answers I saw there was no hope of getting againe what now was lost, therefore (as before) I commended my selfe againe to Gods providence and protection. The Souldiers and Mariners of the <hi>Holland</hi> ship, made hast that afternoone, to unlode the goods of our Frigat into their Man of warre, which tooke them up that, and part of the next day, whilst we as prisoners were wafting up and down the sea with them. And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as we thought our mony had satisfied them enough, and to the full, we found the next day that they had also a stomack to our fowles and Bacon, and wanted our Meale to make them bread, and our hony to sweeten their mouthes, and our Hydes for shooes and bootes; all which they tooke away, leaving me my Quilt, Bookes, and brasse pictures, and to the Master of the frigat some small provision, as much as might car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry us to land, which was not far off, and thus they tooke their leaves of us, than<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king us for their good entertainment. And we weary of such guests, some praying to God that they might never entertaine the like againe, some cursing them all, and especially the Mulatto to hell, calling him Renegado; some thanking God for their lives which were given them for a prey, we all returned again to <hi>Suere</hi> from whence we had set out, and going up the river, were almost like to bee cast away, and lose our lives, after we had lost our goods. When we came to land, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> about the Countrey pitied our case, and helped us with almes gathering a Collection for us. The three <hi>Spaniards</hi> of my company lost all their mony and most of their best clothes, yet they had reserved some bills of Exchange for money to be taken up at <hi>Portobelo;</hi> which I wished I had also for what I had lost. For the present we knew not what course to take; we thought of going to <hi>Rio de los Anzuelos,</hi> but we were informed that certainly the frigats there were either gone, or would be gone before we could get thither; and if they stayed not with the newes of the <hi>Hollanders</hi> ships at sea, they ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther already were or would be their prize, as we had been. We resolved therefore with the charitable assistance of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> about the Countrey to returne again to <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thago,</hi> and from thence to take some better directions. In the way we conferred what we had saved, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> bragged yet of their bills of Exchange, which would yeeld them mony at <hi>Garthago,</hi> I would not let them know what I had saved, but some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what I told them I had kept; and we agreed all the way we went to signifie nothing but poverty and misery, that the <hi>Indians</hi> and <hi>Spaniards</hi> in the way might pitty and commiserate us, and our great losses. When we came to <hi>Carthago</hi> we were indeed much pittied, and Collections were made for us; and as it was expected from mee, that I should sing againe at the Altars (who truely could rather have cried to see and consider my many misfortunes and disasters, which I desired might at last by a safe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne to <hi>England,</hi> prove the trials of the faith I intended to search out) and that I should preach wheresoever I came; so by these two waies, of singing and of hud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling over <hi>Dominus vobiscum</hi> and the rest of the Masse, and by accepting of what Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons were recommended unto me, I began againe to store my selfe with monies. Yet I knew that in such a poore Countrey as that was, where I was little knowne, I could not possibly get enough to bring me home with credit into <hi>England;</hi> and therefore the cunning enemy finding me to stand upon my credit, began strongly to tempt me to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne againe to <hi>Guatemala</hi> (where I doubted not but I should be welcomed and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by my friends) and to settle my selfe there, untill I had againe by sacrilegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, base, superstitious, and idolatrous means, and works, made up a new purse to returne with credit home.</p>
               <p>But I perceiving that God already had shewed himselfe angry, and justly taken from me, what by unlawfull meanes I had in twelve yeers obtained, bad Satan avaunt, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:53246:101"/>
never more to returne to the flesh pots of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and to goe still home-wards, though in the way I did beg my bread. Yet (lest I might be suspected amongst the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and troubled for not exercising my orders and function) I resolved to take what as to a stranger and traveller for preaching or any other exercise might be offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto me.</p>
               <p>Thus with courage resolving to goe on still towards <hi>England,</hi> I enquired at <hi>Carthago</hi> which way I might get to <hi>Portobelo.</hi> But this doore of hope was fast shut up; though my trust in Gods providence was not weakened. In this season, there came to <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thago</hi> some two or three hundred Mules unsadled or unloaden with some <hi>Spaniards, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians,</hi> and <hi>Black-mores,</hi> from the parts of <hi>Comayagua</hi> and <hi>Guatemala</hi> to convey them to <hi>Panama</hi> by land, over the mountaines of <hi>Veragua</hi> there to be sold. This is the yeer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and onely trading by land, which <hi>Guatemala, Comayagua,</hi> and <hi>Nicaragua,</hi> hath with <hi>Panama</hi> over that narrow <hi>Isthmus</hi> lying between the North, and South sea, which is very dangerous by reason of the craggy waies, rockes, and mountaines, but more especially, by reason of many Heathens, Barbarians and savage people, which as yet are not conquered by the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and sometimes do great hurt and mischief, and kill those that with Mules passe through their Countrey, especially if they misdemean themselves, or please them not well. Yet for all these difficulties, I was entertaining a thought to go along with those Mules and <hi>Spaniards,</hi> which were now on their way by land to <hi>Panama.</hi> The three <hi>Spaniards</hi> were halfe of the same mind; but the providence of God who better ordereth and disposeth mans affaires then he himselfe, disappointed these our thoughts for our good and safety, as after we were informed; for we heard for certain at <hi>Nicoya,</hi> that some of those Mules and <hi>Spaniards</hi> were killed by the <hi>Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians</hi> and savage <hi>Indians,</hi> amongst whom my life might have been lost, if I had attem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted that hard and dangerous journey; from which many well wishers at <hi>Carthago</hi> did disswade me, both for the danger of the <hi>Indians,</hi> and for the difficulties of the waies and mountaines, which they told me the weakenesse of my body would never indure.

<pb n="192" facs="tcp:53246:102"/>
                  <hi>Nicoya</hi> is a pretty Towne, and head of a <hi>Spanish</hi> government, where wee found one <hi>Iusto de Salazar,</hi> Alcalde Maior, who entertained us very well, and provided lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings for us for the time that wee should abide there, and comforted us with hopeful words, that though for the present there was no ship or frigat in the Golfe of <hi>Salinas,</hi> yet he doubted not, but very shortly one would come from <hi>Panama</hi> thither, for Salt and other commodities, as yeerly they were wont. The time of the yeer when we came thither, was a fit time for me to get againe some monies after my great losse; for it was in Lent which is the Friers chiefest harvest, who (as I have before observed) then by Confessions and by giving the Communion get many money offerings.</p>
               <p>The time, and the Franciscan Frier who had the Pastorship and charge of that Towne, were both very commodious unto me, who could not refuse as long as I stay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed there to exercise my function, lest I should bring a just cause of suspition and asper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion upon my selfe. The Frier of the Towne was a <hi>Portingal,</hi> who about three weeks before my comming thither had had a very great bickering and strife with <hi>Iusto de Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lazar</hi> the Alcalde Maior, for defending the <hi>Indians,</hi> whom <hi>Salazar</hi> did grievously oppresse, employing them in his, and his wifes service as slaves, and not paying them what for the sweat of their browes was due unto them, and commanding them to be from their home and from their wives, and from their Church upon the Sabbath, working for him as well that day as any other. Which the Frier not enduring, char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged them in the pulpit, not to obey any such unlawfull commands from their Alcalde Maior. But <hi>Iusto de Salazar</hi> (who had been trained up in warres and fighting, and had served formerly in the Castle of <hi>Milan</hi>) thought it a great disparagement unto him, now to be curbed by a Frier, and by such a one to be interrupted in his government of the <hi>Indians,</hi> and in the waies of his owne lucre and gaine. Therefore after many bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter words and defiances, which had passed between him and the Frier, he came one day resolutely to the Friers house with his sword drawne; and certainly had not the Frier been assisted by some of the <hi>Indians,</hi> he had killed him. The Frier being as hot as he, and standing upon his calling, Orders, and Preisthood, presuming that hee durst not touch him violently, lest his priviledge should bring an excommunication up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the striker and offendour, would not flie from him, but dared him boldly; which was a strong provocation to <hi>Satazars</hi> heat and passion, and caused him to lift up his sword, and aime his blow and stroke at the Frier, which fell so unhappily that with it he strucke of two of the Friers fingers, and had undoubtedly seconded another blow more hurtfull and dangerous to the Frier, had not the <hi>Indians</hi> interposed themselves, and shut up their Preist into hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

I staied in this Towne from the second week of Lent untill Easter weeke, where what with three Sermons atten Crownes a peece, what with my daily stipend and many other offerings, I got about an hundred and fifty Crownes.</p>

               <p>There are also shels for other colours, which are not knowne to be so plentifully in any other place as here. About <hi>Chira</hi> and <hi>Golfo de Salinas</hi> the chief commodities are Salt, Hony, Maiz, some Wheat and Fowles, which every yeer they send by some few Frigats to <hi>Panama,</hi> which from thence come on purpose to fetch them with this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple coloured thred, or <hi>Pita,</hi> which I have spoken of. The Frigat which came when I was there, was soon laden with these Commodities, and with it we set out ho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>ng to have been at <hi>Panama</hi> within five or six dayes. But as often before we had been crossed, so likewise in this short passage wee were striving with the Wind, Sea, and Corrientes, as they are called (which are swift streames as of a River) foure full weekes. After the first day that wee set out, wee were driven with a wind and storme towards <hi>Peru,</hi> till wee came under the very Aequinoctiall line, where what with excessive heat, what with mighty stormes, we utterly despaired of life. But after one week that we had thus run towards, it pleased God in whom and by whom all creatures live, move, and have their being, to comfort us againe with hopes of life, sending us a prosperous gale, which drove us out of that Equinoctiall heat, and stormy Sea, towards the Islands of <hi>Perlas,</hi> and <hi>Puerta de Chame,</hi> lying on the South side of the Mountaines of <hi>Veragua,</hi> from whence wee hoped within two dayes at the most, to be at rest and Anchor at <hi>Panama.</hi> But yet these our hopes were frustrated, for there our wind was calmed, and we fell up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on those strong Corrientes or streams, which drave us back in the night for the space of almost a fortnight as much as wee had sailed in the day. Had not God againe been merciful here unto us, we had certainly perished in this our striving with the stream; for although wee wanted not provision of food, yet our drink falled us so, that for foure dayes wee tasted neither drop of wine or water, or any thing that might quench our thirst, save onely a little hony which wee found did cause more thirst in us, which made mee and some others to drink our own Urine, and to refresh our mouthes with peeces of lead bullets, which did for a while refresh, but would not long have sufficed Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, had not Gods good Providence sent us such a wind which in the day drave us quite off from those Corrientes. Our first thoughts were then to strike either to the Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, or some Island of many which were about us to seek for water, finding our bodies weak and languishing; which the Captaine of the Ship would by no meanes yeeld un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, assuring us that that day hee would land us at <hi>Panama;</hi> but wee not being able to saile on without drink, unlesse wee should yeeld to have our dead and not live bodies landed where hee promised, thought it no good purchase though we might buy all <hi>Panama</hi> with our lives, which wee judged could not hold out another day; and seeing that the wind began to slacken, we all required him to strike into some Island for wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; which he stubbornly refused and denyed to doe; whereupon the three <hi>Spaniards</hi> and some of the Mariners mutined against him with drawn Swords, threatning to kill him if he betooke not himselfe presently to some Island. The good Master thought it bad sport to see Swords at his breast, and so commanded his Ship to bee turned to two or three Islands, which were not above two or three houres sail from us. When we drew nigh unto them, wee cast our Anchor, and our Cock-boat, and happy was hee that could first cast himself into it to be rowed to land to fill his belly with water. The first Island wee landed upon, was on that side unhabitable, where wee spent much time running to and fro, over heating our selves and increasing our thirst; thus whilst one ran one way, and another tryed another to find out some fountain, our hopes being frustrated and I lost in the Wood, and my shooes torne from my fee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>, with stony rocks, and many thornes and bushes in other places; my company betook themselves to the Cock-boat to try another Island, leaving mee alone, and lost in the Wood; out of which at last when I came, and found the Cock-boat gone from the shore, I began to consider my self a dead man, thinking that they had found water and were gone to Ship, and not finding mee would <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>oise up their sailes for <hi>Panama.</hi> Thus being dejected I cryed out to the Ship, which I perceived could not possibly hear my weak voyce, and running up and down the Rocks to see if I could discover the Cock-boat, I perceived it was not with the Ship, and espied it at the next Island. With this I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to hope better things of them that they would call for mee when they had gotten
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:53246:103"/>
water; so I came down from the Rocks to the plain shore, where I found a shade of trees and amongst them some berries (which might have been poison, for I knew them not) wherewith I refreshed my mouth for a while; but my body so burned that I thought there with heat, weaknesse and faintnesse I should have expired and given up the Ghost. I thought by stripping my selfe naked and going into the Sea unto my neck, I might thus refresh my body, which I did, and comming out againe into the shade, I fell into a deep sleep, in so much that the Cock-boat comming for mee, and the company hollowing unto mee, I awaked not, which made them feare that I was dead or lost; till landing, one searched for mee one way, and another another, and so they found me, who might have been a prey to some wild Beast, or slept till the Frigat had gone away, and so have perished in a barren and unhabitable Island. When they awaked mee, I was glad to see my good company, and the first thing I enquired for, was, if they had got any water; they bad mee bee of good cheere and arise, for they had water enough, and Oranges and Lemmons from another Island, where they met with <hi>Spaniards</hi> that did inhabit it. I made haste with them to the Boat, and no sooner was I entred into it, but they gave mee to drink as much as I would. The water was warme and unsetled, for they could not take it up so but that they tooke of the gravell and bottome of the Fountain, which made it looke very muddy; yet for all this (as though my life had depended upon it) I drank up a whole pot of it; which no sooner had I dranke, but such was the weaknesse of my stomack that it presently cast it up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine not being able to beare it. With this they wished me to eat an Orange or a Lem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon; but them also did my stomack reject; so to our Frigat wee went, and in the way I fainted so that the company verily thought I would die, before wee got aboard. When wee came thither I called againe for water, which was no sooner downe my sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack, but presently up again; they had mee to bed with a burning Feaver upon mee; where I lay that night expecting nothing but death, and that the Sea should bee my grave.</p>
               <p>The Master of the Ship seeing the wind was turned, began to bee much troubled, and feared that with that wind he should never get to <hi>Panama.</hi> He resolved to venture upon a way, which never before hee had tryed; which was, to get between the two Islands which wee had searched for water, knowing that the wind, which on this side was contrary, on the other side of the Islands would bee favourable unto him. Thus to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Evening hee tooke up Anchor and hoised up his sailes, and resolved to passe his Frigat betwen the two Islands; which how dangerous and desperate an attempt it was, the event witnessed. I lay in this season (as I may truely say) upon my death bed, not regarding which way the Master of the Ship, or fortune carried mee, so that the mercy of the Lord carryed my soule to heaven. No sooner had the Frigat steered her course between the narrow passage of the two Islands, when being carryed with the stream too much to the one side of the land it ran upon a Rock; so that the very stern was lif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted up, and almost cast out of the Pilots hands, who cryed out not to God, but unto the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> saying, <hi>Ayudad nos Virgen Santissima, que si no aqui nos perece<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

This, and the outcry of all that were in the Frigat gave unto mee an Alarm of death; from the which yet it pleased God by the meanes and diligence of the painefull Mariners to deliver mee and all the Company, for with much adoe most part of that night they haled from the Cock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boat the Frigat off from the Rock, after the streame had made it three severall times to strike upon it. After a very troublesome night in the morning wee got our little Shi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

In the Evening wee got to <hi>Puerto de Perico;</hi> where wee cast Anchor, expecting to bee searched in the morning; but that night (the Master of our Ship having gone to shore) the wind turned and blew so strong that wee lost our Anchor<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and and were driven back almost to <hi>la Pacheque</hi> and feared wee should bee carried out into the Ocean againe so farre that we should with great dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty get to <hi>Panama.</hi> But that God whom the Sea and winds doe obey, turned againe that contrary wind into a prosperous gale, wherewith wee came once more unto <hi>Perico;</hi> and being searched wee went on with full sail to <hi>Panama;</hi> Being neere the<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Port and without an Anchor in our Ship the wind once more blew us back and had not the Ship
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:53246:103"/>
Master sent us an Anchor, we had gon againe to <hi>Pacheque</hi> or further. But with that anchor we stayed all that night at <hi>Perico,</hi> wondring among our selves that so many crosses should befall us, which made some say that we were bewitched; others, that certainly there was amongst us some excommunicated person, whom they said if they knew of, they would hurle him over bord. Whilst they were in this discourse, the wind turned yet againe, and we levying our anchor went on to <hi>Panama,</hi> whither it pleased God that time safely to conduct us in. I being now well strengthened made no stay in that frigat, which I thought would have been my last abiding place in this world, but went to land, and betooke my selfe to the Cloister of the Dominicans, where I stay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed almost fifteen daies viewing and reviewing that City; which is governed like <hi>Guate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mala</hi> by a President and six Judges, and a Court of Chancery, and is a Bishops sea. It hath more strength towards the South sea, then any other Port which on that side I had seen, and some Ordnances planted for the defence of it; but the houses are of the least strength of any place that I had entred in; for lime and stone is hard to come by, and therefore for that reason, and for the great heat there, most of the houses are built of timber and bords; the Presidents house, nay the best Church walls are but bords, which serve for stone and bricke, and for tiles to cover the top. The heat is so extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary that a linnen cut doublet, with some slight stuffe or taffetie breeches is the common cloathing of the inhabitants. Fish, fruits and herbage for sallets is more plentifull there then flesh; the coole water of the Coco is the womens best drinke, though Chocolate also, and much wine from <hi>Peru</hi> be very abounding. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> are in this City much given to sinne, loosenesse and venery especially, who make the <hi>Black-mores,</hi> (who are many, rich, and gallant) the chiefe objects of their lust. It is held to be one of the richest places in all <hi>America,</hi> having by land and by the river <hi>Chiagre</hi> commerce with the North sea, and by the South, trading with all <hi>Peru, East-India's, Mexico,</hi> and <hi>Honduras.</hi> Thither is brought the chiefe treasure of <hi>Peru</hi> in two or three great ships, which lie at anchor at <hi>Puerto de Perico</hi> some three leagues from the City; for the great ebbing of the sea at that place especially suffereth not any great vessell to come neerer, where daily the sea ebbs and falls away from the City two or three miles, leaving a mud, which is thought to cause much unhealthinesse in that place, being seconded with many other muddy and moorish places about the Town. It con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth of some five thousand inhabitants, and maintaineth at least eight Cloisters of Nuns and Friers. I feared much the heats, and therefore made as much haste out of it as I could. I had my choice of company by land and water to <hi>Portobelo.</hi> But consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the hardnesse of the mountaines by land, I resolved to goe by the river <hi>Chiagre;</hi> and so at midnight I set out from <hi>Panama</hi> to <hi>Venta de Cruzes,</hi> which is ten or twelve leagues from it. The way is thither very plaine for the most part, and pleasant in the morning and evening.</p>
               <p>Before ten of the clock we got to <hi>Venta de Cruzes,</hi> where live none but <hi>Mulatto's</hi> and <hi>Black-mores,</hi> who belong unto the flat boates that carry the merchandize to <hi>Portobel.</hi> There I had very good entertainment by that people, who desired me to preach unto them the next Sabbath day, and gave me twenty Crownes for a Sermon, and processi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. After five daies of my abode there, the boats set out, which were much stop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped in their passage downe the river; for in some places we found the water very low, so that the boats ran upon the gravell; from whence with poles and the strength of the <hi>Black-mores</hi> they were to be lifted off againe; sometimes again we met with such streams that carried us with the swiftnesse of an arrow downe under trees and boughes by the river side, which sometimes also stopped us till we had cut downe great branches of trees. Had not it pleased God to send us after the first weeke plentifull raine, which made the water run downe from the mountaines and fill the river (which otherwise of it selfe is very shallow) we might have had a tedious and longer passage; but after twelve daies we got to the sea, and at the point landed at the Castle to refresh our selves for halfe a day. Certainly the <hi>Spaniards</hi> trust to the streames and shallownesse of that river, which they thinke will keep off any forain nation, from attempting to come up to <hi>Venta de Cruzes</hi> and from thence to <hi>Panama,</hi> or else they would strengthen more and fortifie that Castle, which in my time wanted great reparations, and was ready to fall downe to the ground. The Governour of the Castle was a notable wine-bibber, who plyed us with that liquor the time that we stayed there, and wanting a Chaplain for himselfe, and Souldiers, would faine have had me stayed with him, but greater

matters called me further, and so I tooke my leave of him, who gave us some dain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of fresh meat, fish, and conserves, and so dismissed us. We got out to the open sea, discovering first the <hi>Escudo de Veragua,</hi> and keeping somewhat close unto the land we went on rowing towards <hi>Portobel,</hi> till the evening which was Saturday night; then we cast anchor behind a little Island, resolving in the morning to enter in <hi>Portobel.</hi> The <hi>Black-mores</hi> all that night kept watch for fear of <hi>Hollanders,</hi> whom they said did often lie in wait thereabouts for the boats of <hi>Chiagre;</hi> but we passed the night safely, and next morning got to <hi>Portobelo,</hi> whose haven we observed to be very strong with two Castles at the mouth and constant watch within them, and another called <hi>St. Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guel</hi> further in the Port.</p>
               <p>When I came into the Haven I was sorry to see that as yet the Galeons were not come from <hi>Spaine,</hi> knowing that the longer I stayed in that place, greater would be my charges. Yet I comforted my selfe that the time of the yeer was come, and that they could not long delay their coming. My first thoughts were of taking up a lodging, which at that time were plentifull and cheape, nay some were offered me for nothing with this caveat, that when the Galeons did come, I must either leave them, or pay a dear rate for them. A kind Gentleman, who was the Kings Treasurer, falling in discourse with me promised to helpe me, that I might be cheaply lodged even when the ships came, and lodgings were at the highest rate. Hee, interposing his authority, went with me to seeke one, which at the time of the fleets being there, might continue to be mine. It was no bigger then would containe a bed, a table, and a stoole or two, with roome enough besides to open and shut the doore, and they demanded of me for it during the foresaid time of the Fleet, sixcore Crownes, which commonly is a fort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night. For the Towne being little, and the Souldiers, that come with the Galeons for their defence at least four or five thousand; besides Merchants from <hi>Pern,</hi> from <hi>Spain</hi> and many other places to buy and sell, is the cause that every roome, though never so small be dear; and sometimes all the lodgings in the Towne are few enough for so many people, which at that time doe meet at <hi>Portobel.</hi> I knew a Merchant who gave a thousand Crownes for a shop of reasonable bignesse, to sell his wares and commodities that yeer that I was there, for fifteen daies only, which the Fleet continued to be in that Haven. I thought it much for me to give the sixcore Crownes which were demanded of me for a room, which was but as a mouse hole, and began to be troubled, and told the Kings Treasurer that I had been lately robbed at sea, and was not able to give so much, and bee besides at charges for my diet, which I feared would prove as much more. But not a farthing would be abated of what was asked; whereupon the good Treasurer pitying me, offered to the man of the house to pay him threescore Crown<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> of it, if so be that I was able to pay the rest, which I must doe, or else lie without in the street. Yet till the Fleet did come I would not enter into this deare hole, but accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of another faire lodging which was offered me for nothing. Whilest I thus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected the Fleets coming, some mony and offerings I got for Masses, and for two Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons which I preached at fifteen Crownes a peece. I visited the Castles, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed seemed unto me to be very strong; but what most I wondred at was to see the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qua's of Mules which came thither from <hi>Panama,</hi> laden with wedges of silver; in one day I told two hundred Mules laden with nothing else, which were unladen in the publicke Market place, so that there the heapes of silver wedges lay like heaps of stones in the street, without any feare or suspition of being lost. Within ten daies the fleet came, consisting of eight Galeons and ten Merchant ships, which forced me to run to my hole. It was a wonder then to see the multitude of people in those streets which the weeke before had been empty.</p>
               <p>Then began the price of all things to rise, a fowl to be worth twelve Rials, which in the main land within I had often bought for one; a pound of beefe then was worth two Rialls, whereas I had had in other places thirteen pound for half a Riall, and so of all other food and provision, which was so excessive dear, that I knew not how to live but by fish and Tortoises, which there are very many, and though somewhat deare, yet were the cheapest meat that I could eate. It was worth seeing how Merchants sold their commodities, not by the Ell or yard, but by the piece and weight, not paying in coined peaces of mony, but in wedges which were weighed and taken for commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. This lasted but fifteen dayes, whilst the Galeons were lading with wedges of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

that in the world there is no greater Fair then that of <hi>Portobel,</hi> between the <hi>Spanish</hi> Merchants and those of <hi>Peru, Panama,</hi> and other parts thereabouts.</p>
               <p>Whilest this traffique was, it happened unto me, that which I have formerly testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in my Recantation Sermon at <hi>Pauls</hi> Church, which if by that meanes it have not come unto the knowledge of many, I desire again to record it in this my History, that to all <hi>England</hi> it may be published; which was, that one day saying Masse in the chiefe Church, after the Consecration of the bread, being with my eyes shut at that mentall prayer, which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> calleth the <hi>Memento</hi> for their dead, there came from behind the Altar a mouse, which running about, came to the very bread or wafer God of the Papists, and taking it in his mouth ran away with it, not being perceived by any of the people who were at Masse, for that the Altar was high by reason of the steps go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up to it, and the people farre beneath. But as soone as I opened my eyes to goe on with my Masse, and perceived my God stollen away, I looked about the Altar, and saw the mouse running away with it; which on a suddain did so stupifie me, that I knew not well what to doe or say, and calling my wits together, I thought that if I should take no notice of the mischance, and any body else in the Church should, I might justly be questioned by the Inquisition; but if I should call to the people to look for the Sacrament, then I might bee but chid and rebuked for my carelessenesse; which of the two I thought would be more easily borne, then the rigour of the Inquisition. Whereupon not knowing what the people had seen, I turned my selfe unto them, and called them unto the Altar, and told them plainely, that whilest I was in my <hi>Memento</hi> prayers and meditations, a mouse had carried away the Sacrament, and that I knew not what to doe, unlesse they would helpe me to find it out again. The people called a Priest that was at hand, who presently brought in more of his Coat; and as if their God by this had been eaten up they presently prepared themselves to find out the thief, as if they would eat up the mouse that had so assaulted and abused their God; they lighted candles and torches to find out the Malefactour in his secret and hidden places of the wall; and after much searching and enquiry for the sacrilegious beast, they found at last in a hole of the wall the Sacrament halfe eaten up; which with great joy they took out, and as if the Arke had been brought again from the <hi>Philistines</hi> to the <hi>Israelites,</hi> so they rejoyced for their new found God, whom with many people now resorted to the Church, with many lights of candles and Torches, with joyfull and solemne musicke they carried about the Church in procession. My selfe was present upon my knees, shaking and quivering for what might be done unto mee, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting my doome and judgement; and as the Sacrament passed by me, I observed in it the markes and signes of the teeth of the mouse, as they are to bee seen in a piece of cheese gnawne and eaten by it.</p>
               <p>This struck mee with such horrour, that I cared not at that present whether I had been torne in a thousand peices for denying publickely that Mouse-eaten God, I called to my best memory all Philosophy concerning substance and accidents, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved within my selfe that what I saw gnawne, was not an accident, but some reall substance eaten and devoured by that vermin, which certainly was fed and nourished by what it had eaten, and Philosophy well teacheth; <hi>substantia Cibi (non accidentis) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertitur in substantiam aliti,</hi> the substance (not the accident) of the food or meat is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, and turned into the substance of the thing fed by it and alimented; Now here I knew that this Mouse had fed upon some substance, or else how could the markes of the teeth so plainely appeare? But no Papist will bee willing to answer that it fed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the substance of Christs Body, <hi>ergo</hi> by good consequence it followes that it fed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the substance of bread; and so Transubstantiation here in my judgement was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed by a Mouse; which meane and base creature God chose to convince mee of my former errours, and made mee now resolve upon what many yeeres before I had doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that certainly the point of Transubstantiation taught by the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is most damnable and erroneous; for besides, what before I have observed, it contradicteth that Philosophicall Axiome, teaching that <hi>duo contradictoria non possunt simul &amp; semel de codem verificari,</hi> two contradictories cannot at once and at the self same time be said, and verified of the same thing; but here it was so; for here in <hi>Romes</hi> Judgement and opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion Christs body was gnawne and eaten, and at the same time the same body in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place and upon another Altar in the hands of another Preist was not eaten and gnawne, Therefore here are two contradictories verified of the same body of Christ:
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:53246:105"/>
to wit, it was eaten and gnawne, and it was not eaten and gnawne. These impressions at that time were so great in me, that I resolved within my selfe, that bread really and truely was eaten upon that Altar, and by no meanes Christs glorious body which is in heaven, and cannot be upon earth, subject to the hunger or violence of a creature. Here againe I desired with godly <hi>David,</hi> that I might have the wings of a Dove to flie into my Country of <hi>England,</hi> and there be satisfied upon this point, and be at rest of Conscience. Here I resolved that if I had been questioned for my carelessenesse, or for my contempt of that Romish Sacrament (which I thought would be the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who knew me to be an <hi>English</hi> man borne) that I would sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice willingly my life for the Protestant truth, which as yet I had been no otherwise taught, but by that Spirit which (as <hi>Solomon</hi> well observeth) in a man is the candle of the Lord. I conceived here that this was some comfort to my soule, which my good God will afford mee in the way of my travelling to <hi>Canaan,</hi> that I might more wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly beare whatsoever crosses yet might befall mee in my way and Journey to <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland.</hi> The event of this accident was not any trouble that fell upon mee for it; for indeed the <hi>Spaniards</hi> attributed it unto the carelesnesse of him, who had care of the Altars in the Church, and not to any contempt in mee to the Sacrament. The part of the wafer that was left after the Mouse had filled her belly, was laid up after the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne Procession about the Church, in a Tabernacle for that purpose, that afterwards it might be eaten up by some hungry Preist. And because such a high contempt had beene offered by a contemptible Vermin to their Bread God, it was commanded through <hi>Portabel</hi> that day, that all the people should humble themselves and mourn, and fast with bread and water onely. Although I saw I was not questioned for the case, yet I feared where there were so many Souldiers, and forain people, that by some or other I might bee mischiefed out of their blind zeale, wherefore I thought it not amisse for a day or two to keepe within my lodging. <hi>Don Carlos de Ybarra,</hi> who was the Admirall of that Fleet, made great haste to bee gone; which made the Merchants buy and sell apace, and lade the ships with silver wedges; whereof I was glad, for the more they laded, the lesse I unladed my purse with buying deare provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, and sooner I hoped to be out of that unhealthy place, which of it selfe is very hot, and subject to breed Feavers, nay death, if the feet bee not preserved from wetting when it raineth; but especially when the Fleet is there, it is an open grave ready to swallow in part of that numerous people, which at that time resort unto it, as was seene the yeare that I was there when about five hundred of the Souldiers, Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, and Mariners, what with Feavers, what with the Flux caused by too much eating of fruit and drinking of water, what with other disorders lost their lives, find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it to bee to them not <hi>Porto bello,</hi> but <hi>Porto malo.</hi> And this is usuall every yeare; and therefore for the reliefe and comfort of those that come sick from Sea, or sicken there, a great and rich Hospitall is in the Towne, with many Fryers called<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>De la Capacha,</hi> or by others <hi>De Iuan de Dios,</hi> whose calling and profession is onely to cure, and attend upon the sick, and to beare the dead unto their graves. The Admirall fearing the great sicknesse that yeare, made haste to be gone, not fearing the report that was of some three or four <hi>Holland</hi> or <hi>English</hi> ships abroad at Sea, waiting (as it was sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed) for some good prize out of that great and rich Fleet. This news made mee beginne to feare, and to thinke of securing my selfe in one of the best and strongest Galeons; but when I came to treat of my passage in one of them, I found that I could not bee carryed in any under three hundred Crownes, which was more then my purse was able to afford. With this I thought to addresse my self to some Master of a Merchants ship, though I knew I could not bee so safe and secure in any of them, as in a Galeon well manned and fortified with Souldiers, and Guns of Brasse; yet I hoped in God, who is a strong refuge to them that feare him, and in this occasion provided for mee a cheap and sure passage. For meeting one day with my friend the Treasurer, hee againe pitying me as a stranger and lately robbed, commended me to the Master of a Merchant Ship, called St. <hi>Sebastian,</hi> whom hee knew was desirous to carry a Chaplaine with him at his own Table. I no sooner addressed my selfe unto him, using the name and favour of his and my friend the Treasurer, but presently I found him willing to accept of my company, promising to carry me for nothing, and to board mee at his own Table, onely for my prayers to God for him and his; offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

I blessed God, acknowledging in this also his Providence, who in all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions furthered my returne to <hi>England.</hi> The Ships being laden wee set forth towards <hi>Carthagena;</hi> and the second day of our sayling wee discovered foure Ships which made the Merchant Ships afraid, and to keepe close to the Galeons, trusting to their strength more then their own. The Ship I was in, was swift and nimble under sail, and kept still under the wings either of the Admirall or of some other of the best Galeons; but all the other Merchants Ships were not so, but some slowly came on behind, whereof two were carryed away by the <hi>Hollanders</hi> in the night, before ever wee could get to <hi>Carthagena.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The greatest feare that I perceived possessed the <hi>Spaniards</hi> in this Voyage, was about the Island of <hi>Providence,</hi> called by them <hi>Sta Catalina,</hi> or St. <hi>Catharine,</hi> from whence they feared lest some <hi>English</hi> Ships should come out against them with great strength. They cursed the <hi>English</hi> in it, and called the Island, the den of theeves and Pirates, wishing that their King of <hi>Spain</hi> would take some course with it; or else, that it would prove very prejudiciall to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> lying neer the mouth of the <hi>Desaguadero,</hi> and so endangering the Frigats of <hi>Granada,</hi> and standing between <hi>Portobel</hi> and <hi>Carthagena,</hi> and so threatning the Galeons, and their Kings yeerely and mighty treasure.</p>

though a Prisoner unto them desired to question in the field, challenging his proud contemners to meet him if they durst in any place of the Havana, (a brave courage in a dejected and imprisoned <hi>English</hi> man to challenge a <hi>Spaniard</hi> in his Country, a Cock upon his own dunghill,) which as soone as I understood by <hi>Edward Layfield,</hi> I desired to take up, fearing that many would fall upon him cowardly and mince him small in peices. I sent for him to the Cloister where I lay, and there had conference with him, prevailing so far as that I made him desist from his thoughts of going into the field, and shewing his manhood in such a time and place, where his low condition of a Prisoner might well excuse him. The rest of my poore country men were here much discouraged and in some want; whom I relieved (especially <hi>Layfield</hi>) and incouraged as much as I was able. I chanced here to have occasion to take a little physick before I went again to Sea, &amp; thereby I learned what before I never knew, to wit, the dyet which on such aday the best Physitians of <hi>Havana</hi> prescribe unto their patients. Whereas after the working of my physick, I expected some peece of Mutton, or a fowl, or some other nourishing meat, my Physitian left order that I should have a peece of rosted Porke, which seeming unto mee a Dyet contrary to that daies extremity, I began to refuse it, alleadging to my Doctor the contrary course of all Nations, the naturall quality of that meat to open the body. To which he replyed, that what Porke might worke upon mans body in other Nations, it worked not there, but the contrary; and so he wish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me to feed upon what hee had prescribed, assuring mee that it would doe mee no hurt. Now as Hogs flesh there is held to be so nourishing, so likewise no other meat is more then it, and Tortoises, wherewith all the ships make their provision for <hi>Spain.</hi> The Tortoises they cut out in long thin slices, as I have noted before of the Tassajos, and dry it in the wind after they have well salted it, and so it serveth the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riners, in all their voyage to <hi>Spain,</hi> which they eate boyled with a little garlicke, and I have heard them say that to them it tasted as well as any Veale. They also take into their ships some fowles for the Masters and Captaines tables, and live hogs, which would seem to be enough to breed some infection in the ship, had they not care to wash often the place where such unclean beasts lie. In the ship where I was passenger, was killed every weeke one for the Masters, Pilots and passengers table. Thus all things being made ready for the ships provision to <hi>Spain,</hi> and the Merchants goods and the Kings Revenue being shipped in nine dayes that we abode there; we now wanted nothing, but onely the company of the Fleet from <hi>Vera Cruz,</hi> which should have met us there upon the eight day of <hi>September.</hi> But <hi>Don Carlos de Ybarra,</hi> see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it stayed longer then the time appointed, and fearing the weather, &amp; the New Moon of that moneth which commonly proveth dangerous in the Golf of <hi>Babama,</hi> resolved to stay no longer, but to set out to <hi>Spain.</hi> On a Sabbath day therefore in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing we hoised sails, (being in all seven and twenty ships with those which had met with us there from <hi>Honduras</hi> and the Islands), and one by one we sailed out of Havana to the main Sea, where we that day wafted about for a good wind, and also waiting for our guide, which was not yet come out of the Havana to guide us through the Gulfe of <hi>Bahama.</hi> But that night wee wished our selves againe in the Havana, thinking that we were compassed about with a strong Fleet of <hi>Hollanders;</hi> many ships came amongst us, which made us provide for a fight in the morning.

We went on sometimes one way, sometimes another, not well knowing where wee were, drinking our stinking water by allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of pints, till three or foure dayes after the storme was ceased, wee discovered land, which made all cry out, <hi>Hispania, Hispania, Spain, Spain;</hi> whilst a Counsell was summoned by the Admirall to know what land that was, some sold away barrels of bisket, others of water, to those that wanted (every one thinking that it was some part of <hi>Spain,</hi>) but the result of the wise Counsell was, after they had sailed neerer to the land, and had layed and lost many wages about it, that it was the Island of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dera,</hi> which made some curse the ignorancee of the Pilots, and made us all prepare our selves with patience for a longer voyage. It pleased God from the discovery of this Island, to grant us a favourable wind to <hi>Spain,</hi> where within twelve dayes we dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered <hi>Cales;</hi> and some of the ships there left us, but most of them went forward to <hi>San Lucar,</hi> as did the ship wherein I went; when wee came neere to the danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous place, which the <hi>Spaniards</hi> call <hi>La Barra,</hi> wee durst not venture our ships up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our Pilots own knowledge; but called for Pilots to guide us in, who greedy of their lucre came out in boats almost for every ship one.

That night therefore I betooke my selfe to an <hi>English</hi> Ordinary, where I refreshed my selfe and my poore prisoners, (who by the Master of the ship were committed to my charge that night and forwards upon my word, so as to bee forth comming when they should bee called) and the next morning I sent my honest friend <hi>Layfield</hi> with a letter to the Cloister to old <hi>Pablo de Londres,</hi> who upon my summons came joyfully to welcome mee from the <hi>India's,</hi> and after very little discourse told mee of ships in the Haven ready to set out for <hi>England.</hi> The old Fryer being of a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crepit and doting age, thought every day a yeere that I stayed there, and suspended my Voyage for <hi>England,</hi> and (not knowing the secrets of my heart) judged alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy that the Conversion or turning of many Protestant soules to Popery waited for my comming, which made him hasten mee, who was more desirous then hee to bee gone the next day, if I might have found wind, weather, and shipping ready. But God, who had been with me in almost ninety dayes sailing from <hi>Havana</hi> to <hi>San Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>car,</hi> and had delivered mee from many a storme, prepared and furthered all things in a very short time for the last accomplishment of my hope and desire, to returne to <hi>England</hi> my native soil, from whence I had been absent almost for the space of foure and twenty yeers.</p>

girded about with a leathern belt, and over it from the shoulders downward a white Scapulary (so called there,) hanging shorter then the gown both before and behind, and over that a white hood to cover the head, and lastly, over that a black cloak with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother black hood; both which together, the black and white make the Fryers of that profession look just like Mag-pies, and is acknowledged by the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> it self in a verse which they faine of Mr. <hi>Martin Luther,</hi> (with what just ground I know not) saying of his former life and profession before his Conversion, <hi>Bis Corvus, bis Pica fui, ter fune ligatus.</hi> I was twice a Crow, twice a Magpie, and thrice was bound or tyed with a Cord; by a Crow meaning an Augustin Fryer, who is all in black; by a Magpie, meaning a Dominican, and by bound with a rope or cord, meaning a Franciscan, who indeed is girded about with a cord made of hempe. Though the Dominican Magpie by this his habit make such a glosse and understanding, which is contrary to his life and conversation; for by his outward black habit, hee saith, is signified an outward shew of deadnesse and Mortification to the world, and by his inward white habit, an inward purity and chastity of heart, thoughts and life; both which truely are little seen in those Fryers especially, who outwardly are world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and living to the world, covetous and ambitious of honours, preferments, Bishop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rickes, and places of publique reading and preaching; and therefore have by favour obtained many places of authority, as by the laws of <hi>Aragon</hi> to be the King of <hi>Spain</hi> his Ghostly father, to bee Masters of the Popes Palace, and there to read a lesson of Divinity, to be chief heads of the Inquisition, and from these places to bee pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted to sit in the Councell of the State in <hi>Spain,</hi> or to bee Cardinals in <hi>Rome,</hi> and so Popes, or to injoy the richest and fattest Bishopricks and Arch-Bishopricks in <hi>Spain, Italy,</hi> and <hi>India's,</hi> which sheweth how little they are dead to the world, nay how they are living to the world and its preferments<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> contrary to the black and dead colour of their habits. So likewise doe they not live according to the whitenesse of their inward habits, whose lives are found impure and unchast, as I could exemplifie at large, shewing what base and unclean acts have been committed by some of that profession in the Low Countries, in <hi>Spain,</hi> in the <hi>India's,</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> nay here in <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi> by one <hi>Dade</hi> the Superior of them, by one <hi>Pophar</hi> well knowen to bee a good fellow, and still at this day abiding in the <hi>Spanish</hi> house, by one <hi>Crafts</hi> and others, which would bee too too long a digression from the whitenesse of their habit. But I applying the Allegory of this black and white habit otherwise unto my selfe, and in the outward black part of it seeing the foulenesse and filthinesse of my life and I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatrous Preisthood in the exercise of that profession, and Orders which from <hi>Rome</hi> I had received; and in the white inward habit considering yet the purity, and inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity of those intentions and thoughts of my inward heart, in pursuance whereof I had left what formerly I have noted, yea all <hi>America,</hi> which, had I continued in it, might have been to mee a Mine of wealth, riches and treasure; I resolved here therefore to cast off that hypocriticall cloak and habit, and to put on such Apparell whereby I might no more appeare a Wolfe in sheepskin, but might goe boldly to my Country of <hi>England,</hi> there to shew and make known the Candor of my heart, the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and sincerity of my thoughts, which had brought mee so farre, by a publik pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of the pure truths of the Gospell, without any invention or addition of man unto it. With the small meanes therefore which was left mee after so long and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most a whole yeeres journey from <hi>Petapa</hi> to St. <hi>Lucar</hi> (having yet about a hundred Crownes) I gave order for a sute of Cloathes to bee made by an <hi>English</hi> Taylor, which I willingly put on, and so prepared myself for <hi>England.</hi> Three or four ships were in readinesse, who had onely waited for the Fleet, to take in some Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities, especially some wedges of silver, of which I was with old <hi>Pablo de Londres,</hi> in doubt which to choose. The first that went out was thought should have beene my lot, in the which my friend <hi>Layfield</hi> imbarked himselfe (for all the <hi>English</hi> priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners were there freed to goe home to their Country) and from which the great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of God diverted mee, or else I had beene this day with <hi>Layfield</hi> a slave in <hi>Turkey;</hi> for the next day after this ship set out, it was taken by the <hi>Turkes,</hi> and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed away for a rich prize, and all the <hi>English</hi> in it for prisoners to <hi>Argell.</hi> But God (who I hope had reserved mee for better things,) appointed for mee a safer convoy home in a ship (as I was informed) belonging to Sir <hi>William Curtin,</hi> under the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of an honest <hi>Flemming,</hi> named <hi>Adrian Adrianzen</hi> living at <hi>Dover</hi> then, with

whom I agreed for my passage and dyet at his Table. This ship set out of the Barre of St. <hi>Lucar</hi> the ninth day after my arrivall thither, where it waited for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of foure ships more, but especially for some <hi>Indian</hi> wedges of silver, which upon for<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Yet I thought my kinred (who knew I had beene many yeers lost) would some way or other acknowledge mee, and take notice of mee, if at the first I addressed my selfe unto some of them, untill I could better expresse my selfe in <hi>English.</hi> The first therefore of my name, whom I had notice of, was my Lady <hi>Penelope Gage,</hi> widow of Sir <hi>Iohn Gage,</hi> then living in St. <hi>Iones;</hi> to whom the next morning after my arrivall to <hi>London,</hi> I addressed my selfe for the better discovery of some of my kinred; whom though I knew to bee Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists, and therefore ought not to be acquainted with my inward purpose and resolution; yet for feare of some want in the mean time, and that I might by their means pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice my selfe in the use of my forgotten native tongue, and that I might enquire what Childs part had been left me by my father, that I might learn some fashions, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

To which hee made mee answer, that my father had indeed left him, and my Brother the Colonell, and two other sons by a second wife, and my owne sister, every one somewhat, but to mee nothing, nay that at his death he did not so much as remember mee; which I could not but take to heart<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and called to minde the angry and threatning letter which I had received from him in <hi>Spain,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I would not bee a Jesuite. Though for the present I said nothing, yet after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards in many occasions I told my Brother I would have the Will produced, and would by course of law demand a childs part; but hee put me off, assuring me I should never want amongst other my friends and kindred, with whom hee knew I should bee well accommodated as long as I continued in <hi>England.</hi> After few dayes that I had been in <hi>London,</hi> my kinsman at <hi>Cheam,</hi> desired me to come to live with him; where I continued not long; for my Uncle at <hi>Gatton</hi> invited mee to his house, offering mee there meat, drink, lodging, horse and man, with twenty pound a yeare, which hee promised in other waies to make as good as thirty. Here I continued a twelve moneth, refining my self in my native tongue, and (though altogether unknown to my Uncle and kindred) searching into the Doctrine and truth of the Gospel professed in <hi>England;</hi> for which cause I made many journeys to <hi>London,</hi> and then privately I resorted to some chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and especially to <hi>Paul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

discover my secret intents and purpose of heart. At this time comming once from <hi>Surrey</hi> to <hi>London,</hi> I chanced to bee discovered and knowne to one of the State<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, a Pursevant, who had a large Commission for the apprehending of Seminary Preists and Jesuites, named <hi>Iohn Gray,</hi> who meeting mee one day in <hi>Long Aker,</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed and dogged me as far as <hi>Lincolns Inne</hi> wall, where he clapped mee on the shoulders, and told me, that he had a Commission against mee, to apprehend mee, and carry me to the Councell Table or to one of His Majesties Secretaries. To whom I spoke in <hi>Spanish</hi> (thinking thereby to free my selfe out of his hands for a <hi>Spaniard:</hi>) but this would not doe, for he replyed hee knew mee to bee an <hi>English</hi> man born, and by the name of <hi>Gage,</hi> and Brother to Colonell <hi>Gage</hi> and Mr. <hi>George Gage,</hi> and that before he left mee I must speake in <hi>English</hi> to him, he carryed mee to a Tavern, and there searched my Pockets for Letters and mony, which in discourse he told me was too little for him (not being above twelve shilling) and that I must goe with him to answer before one of His Majesties Secretaries. I told him that I would willingly goe before the Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> or before Sir <hi>Francis Windebanke;</hi> at which he smiled, saying<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I knew well whom to make choice of to favour and protect mee, but hee would carry mee to none of them, but to Secretary <hi>Cooke.</hi> I fearing the businesse might goe hard with me, and knowing him to be greedy of money, told him that I would give him any thing that might content him, and so offered him twelve shillings then about mee, and my word to meet him in any place the next day, with a better and fuller purse. Hee accepted of my money for the present, and further offer for the day following, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed the <hi>Angel</hi> Taverne in <hi>Long Aker,</hi> (knowing that I lodged thereabout) to bee the place of our meeting, and so dismissed mee. I being free from him, went immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately to my Brother, and told him what had happened unto mee, what money I had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready given unto him, and what I had promised the next day following. My Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hearing me began to cha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Yet I told him I would according to my word and promise meet him the next day, and satisfie him for his faire carriage towards mee; to which my Brother would by no means yeeld, but said hee wou'd meet him; which hee accordingly performed, and although for my sake and promise he gave him some money, yet he brought him before Signor <hi>Con,</hi> and there himselfe and the Popes Agent with him spake most bitter words unto him, and threatned him very much if e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver again he durst meddle with mee.</p>
                  <p>After this my Brother carryed mee to one Sir <hi>William Howard</hi> a Papist Knight, living at <hi>Arundel</hi> gate over <hi>Clements</hi> Church, who was very familiar with Sir <hi>Francis Winde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banke,</hi> telling him what had happened unto me, and desiring him to carry me with him in his Coach to Sir <hi>Francis,</hi> and to get his protection for mee. Secretary <hi>Windebanke</hi> understanding who I was, told mee I should feare no Pursevant of them all, and that if I lived quietly in <hi>England,</hi> no body should trouble me, and that <hi>Iohn Gray</hi> was a knave, and wished me if ever he medled with me ag<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

I was therefore much troubled in mind and conscience, which I found was curbed with the great power of the Papists. I resolved therefore to goe againe out of <hi>England,</hi> and to travell in some other Countries amongst both Papists and Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants, and to try what better satisfaction I could find for my conscience at <hi>Rome</hi> in that Religion, or in <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Germany</hi> amongst the Protestants.

not, nor had seen him from a child. I had no other passe to take shipping at <hi>Dover,</hi> but onely the letter of a Papist in <hi>London,</hi> (by meanes of one <hi>Popham</hi> a Dominican Fryer) to Sir <hi>Iohn Manwood</hi> his Lady, who was then Governour of <hi>Dover</hi> Castle, and with the foresaid letter suffered mee not to bee troubled, examined or searched, but gave order that I should freely and quietly passe over in the Packet boat to <hi>Dunkerke,</hi> wherewith in foure houres with a good wind I arrived, and from thence by <hi>Newport</hi> and <hi>Bridges</hi> went to <hi>Gant;</hi> not farre from whence my Brother with his Regimeut lay in field against the <hi>Hollander.</hi> Hee was glad to see mee, and knowing what journey I was minded to take, furnished mee with more money, and for my Uncles businesse recommended mee to the Marques <hi>De Seralvo</hi> (then at <hi>Brussels</hi>) and to other great men, desiring them to give mee their letters to their friends at <hi>Rome;</hi> from them I got a let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to <hi>Don Francisco Barbarini,</hi> the Popes Nephew, and one of the chief Cardinals then in <hi>Rome,</hi> likewise to Cardinal <hi>Cucua,</hi> and Cardinal <hi>Albornos</hi> both <hi>Spaniards.</hi> With these letters I thought I should have occasion of some conversation with these pillars of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and in discourse might pry into the hearts and wayes of them, and see whether in them were more Policy then Religion. By reason of the Warres between <hi>France</hi> and the <hi>Low Countries,</hi> I durst not make my journey the neerest and shortest way through <hi>France;</hi> but though there were Wars also in <hi>Germany,</hi> I thought that would bee my safest way, and I desired much to looke into the Protestant, and <hi>Lutberan</hi> Church in that Country. Whereupon I resolved from <hi>Brussels</hi> to goe to <hi>Namurs,</hi> and from thence by water to <hi>Leidge,</hi> and from thence to <hi>Collen</hi> in <hi>Germany.</hi> From <hi>Leidge</hi> to <hi>Collen</hi> though wee were twelve in company, wee were much troubled with Souldiers; yet God still delivered me and brought me safe to <hi>Collen;</hi> from whence by the river <hi>Rhine</hi> I went in boat to <hi>Frankefort</hi> in <hi>September</hi> at the time of that great Fair, where I knew I should meet company of Merchants to any part of <hi>Italy.</hi> In all my travells I never made a more pleasant journey then that which I made by the river <hi>Rhine,</hi> where I had occasion to see many fair and goodly Cities. In <hi>Frankefort</hi> there I began to take notice of the <hi>Lutheran</hi> Church, and for the space of a fortnight that I stayed there, had many thoughts of discovering my selfe there, and disclaiming Popery, thinking that there I might be sure and fafe, and lie hid and unknowne to my Brothers and kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, who in <hi>England</hi> would not suffer me to live a Protestant. Yet againe I considered how hard it would bee for mee a stranger to subsist there, and to get any livelyhood, for the which I must first get the native tongue, and though many points that were op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> pleased me, yet in some points of that Religion my conscience was not satisfied. At the end of the Faire I sought out for company, and found neere a dozen wagons which were upon setting out towards <hi>Auspurg</hi> with goods of Merchants, who had also hired a Convoy of thirty soulders to goe along with them; which I thought would be safe company for mee; with them, and many other passengers and travellers that went in the Wagons, and on foot, by them, I went as far as the famous and gallant City of <hi>Auspurg;</hi> from whence forward there was no great danger, neither in what part belonged to the Duke of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> nor in the County of <hi>Tirol:</hi> from whence wee passed some foure together to <hi>Trent;</hi> where I was taken with the first Agu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </hi> I might goe by Sea to <hi>Ligorne,</hi> and so likewise to <hi>Rome.</hi> After a fortnights stay in <hi>Genoua,</hi> I went with the Galleys of the great Duke of <hi>Florence</hi> to <hi>Ligorne,</hi> where I found no boats ready to <hi>Rome,</hi> and so in the mean time, whilst they were preparing, I went to <hi>Pisa</hi> and <hi>Fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence</hi> to see those brave Cities, and returned again to <hi>Ligorne,</hi> where I found many boats ready to set out to <hi>Rome.</hi>

                  <p>The first night and day wee had a faire winde to <hi>Piombino;</hi> but there it turned, and continued contrary for almost three weekes.

I perceived by his discourse that hee knew much of <hi>England,</hi> and desired to know more; and propounded unto mee many questions concerning the state of this Kingdome, and especially concerning the Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> whom he seemed to affect; and yet sometime againe would say hee feared, hee would cause some great disturbance in our Kingdome, and that certainly for his sake and by his means the King had dissolved lately the Parliament (which was that which before this now sitting was so suddainly dissolved by his Majesty) which hee feared, <hi>Scotland</hi> and most of the people of <hi>England,</hi> would take very ill.

But hee was too yong, and some scandall of a Gentlewoman, who stuck too close to him, made the red Cap unfit for his head; and secondly, because a greater then hee, to wit, Sir <hi>Ke<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

But though hee had great favour from the Queen, and was her Agent; yet hee had strong Antagonists in <hi>Fitzherbert, Courtney,</hi> and the rest of the crew of the Jesuites, who looked upon that honour and red Cap as better becomming one of their profession, and fitter for a head which had formerly worne a four Cornered black Cap, to wit, Sir <hi>Toby Matby.</hi> But in case the said Cap should fall from Sir <hi>Toby</hi> his head; then they would helpe and further a third, whose birth and Nobility should advance him before Sir <hi>Kenelham Digby,</hi> to wit, <hi>Walter Mountague,</hi> the old Earle of <hi>Manchester</hi> his sonne at that time.</p>
                  <p>And thus it was a generall and credible report in <hi>Rome,</hi> that either a <hi>Digby,</hi> a <hi>Mathy,</hi> or a <hi>Mount<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Whereby I perceived that <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi> was comming neere to <hi>Rome,</hi> and that my design of professing and following the truth in <hi>England</hi> was blasted, and that in vain I had come from <hi>America</hi> for satisfaction of my conscience in <hi>England.</hi> I was more troubled now then ever; and desired to try all wayes, if I could bee better satisfied concerning the Popish Religion in <hi>Rome, Naples</hi> or <hi>Venice,</hi> (whither I went) then I had been in <hi>America</hi> and among the <hi>Spaniards.</hi> But I found such exorbitances and scandalls in the lives of some Cardinals of <hi>Rome,</hi> whilst I was there, especially in <hi>Don Antonio Barbarini,</hi> and Cardinal <hi>Burgest<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                  <p>Yet after I had got this Order, I bethought my selfe further that I would try one way, which was to see if I could find out a Miracle, which might give mee better satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of the <hi>Romish</hi> Religion, then had the former experience of my life, and the lives of the Priests, Cardinals, and all such with whom I had lived in <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>America.</hi> I had heard much of a Picture of our Lady of <hi>Loretto,</hi> and read in a Booke of Miracles or lies concerning the same, that whosoever prayed before that picture in the state of mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall sinne, the picture would discover the sinne in the soule, by blushing, and by sweat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Now I framed this argument to my selfe, that it was a great sin, the sin of unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe, or to waver and stagger in points of Faith; but in mee (according to the Tenents of <hi>Rome</hi>) was this sin, for I could not believe the point of Transubstantiation, and many other; therefore (if the Miracles which were printed of the foresaid Lady of <hi>Loretto</hi> were true, and not lies) certainly shee would blush and sweat, when such an unbeliever as I prayed before her. To make this triall, I went purposely to <hi>Loretto,</hi> and kneeling downe before God, not with any faith I had in the picture; I prayed earnestly to the true Searcher of all hearts, that in his Son Jesus Christ he would mercifully looke up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me a wretched sinner, and inspire and enlighten mee with his Spirit of truth, for the good and salvation of my soule; In my prayer I had a fixed and setled eye upon the Ladies picture, but could not perceive that shee did either sweat or blush, wherewith I arose up from my knees much comforted and incouraged in my resolution to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce and abandon Popery, and saying within my selfe as I went out of the Church, surely if my Lady neither sweat nor blush, all is well with mee, and I am in a good way for salvation, and the miracles written of her are but lies. With this I resolved to follow the truth in some Protestant Church in <hi>France,</hi> and to relinquish errour and superstition. Upon which good purpose of mine, I presently perceived the God of truth did smile, with what I heard hee was ordering in <hi>England</hi> by an Army of <hi>Scotland</hi> raised for Reformation, and by a new Parliament called to <hi>Westminster,</hi> at which I saw the Papists and Jesuites there began to tremble, and to say that it would blast all their designes, and all their hopes of setling Popery; <hi>William Laud</hi> his policy was now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned and cursed, <hi>Con</hi> was dead at <hi>Rome,</hi> the Cardinal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

I was too weak of body to make my journey by land (by reason of my long Ague which had but newly left mee) and so resolved to goe to <hi>Ligorne</hi> to find out shipping there; where I found foure or five ships of <hi>English</hi> and <hi>Hollanders</hi> ready to set out, but were bound to touch at <hi>Lisboe</hi> in their way. I bargained with one Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine <hi>Scot</hi> for my passage, first to <hi>Lisboe,</hi> intending there to make a second bargain. We had no sooner sailed on as farre as to the Coast of <hi>France,</hi> joyning to the <hi>Dutchy</hi> of Savoy, but presently from <hi>Canes</hi> came out part of a Fleet lying there under the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the Bishop of <hi>Burdeaux</hi> to discover us, and take us for a lawfull prize. I might say much here of the valour of the good old Captaine <hi>Scot,</hi> who seeing all the other ships had yeelded to the <hi>French</hi> men of Warre, would upon no termes yeeld to be their prize, (which they challenged because wee were bound for <hi>Lisboe,</hi> then their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies Country) but would fight with them all, and at last rather blow up his ship, then to deliver the goods which had been intrusted to him by the Merchants of <hi>Ligorne.</hi> We were in a posture to fight, our guns ready, and Mariners willing to dye that day, which was heavy news to me. After much treaty between the <hi>French</hi> and our valorous Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, who still held out and would not yeeld, there came up to us two ships to give us the last warning that if wee yeelded not, they would immediately set our ship on fire. With this all the passengers and many more in the ship desired the Captaine to yeeld upon some faire Articles for the securing of what goods he had for <hi>England,</hi> and should appeare were not any way for the strengthening of any enemies to the State and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of <hi>France.</hi> With much adoe our Captaine was perswaded, and we were carried with the rest into <hi>Canes</hi> for a lawfull prize. I seeing that the ships were like to bee stayed there long, obtained the Bishop of <hi>Burdeaux</hi> his passe to goe to <hi>Marcells,</hi> and from thence by land through <hi>France.</hi> Which being granted, I went by water to <hi>Tolon,</hi> and from thence to <hi>Marcells,</hi> and so in company of Carriers to <hi>Lions,</hi> and from thence to <hi>Paris, Roane,</hi> and <hi>Deepe,</hi> where in the first packet boat to <hi>Rye</hi> I passed over to <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi> where I landed upon <hi>Michaelmas</hi> day the same yeere that this present Parliament began to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

My Brothers Spirit I found was not much daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the new Parliament, nor some of the proudest Papists, who hoped for a sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain dissolving of it; But when I saw their hopes frustrated by His Majesties consent to the continuing of it, I thought the acceptable time was come for mee, wherein I ought not to dissemble any further with God, the world and my friends, and so resolved to bid adieu to flesh and blood; and to prize Christ above all my kindred, to own and professe him publiquely maugre all opposition of hell and kindred to the contrary. I made my self first knowne to Doctor <hi>Brunnick,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Exeter,</hi> and to Mr. <hi>Shu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

The Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of <hi>Exeter</hi> carried me to the Bishop of <hi>London</hi> then at <hi>Fullom,</hi> from whom I received order to Preach my Recantation Sermon at <hi>Pauls:</hi> which done, I thought I must yet doe more to satisfie the world of my sincerity, knowing that Converts are hardly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved by the common sort of people, unlesse they see in them such actions which may further disclaime <hi>Rome</hi> for ever for the future. Whereupon I resolved to enter into the state of Marriage (to which God hath already given his blessing) which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> disavowes to all her Preists. What I have beene able to discover for the good of this State I have done, and not spared (when called upon) to give in true evidence upon my Oath against Jesuites, Preists, and Fryers; for the which (after a faire invita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from my Brother Colonel <hi>Gage,</hi> to come over again to <hi>Flanders,</hi> offering mee a thousand pound ready money) I have been once assaulted in <hi>Aldersgate street;</hi> and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther time like to be killed in <hi>Shooe lane</hi> by a Captain of my Brothers Regiment, named <hi>Vincent Burton,</hi> who (as I was after informed) came from <hi>Flanders</hi> on purpose to make me away or convey mee over, and with such a malicious designe followed mee to my lodging, lifting up the latch and opening the doore, (as hee had seene mee done) and attempting to goe up the staires to my chamber without any inquiry for mee, or knock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

at the doore; from whom God graciously delivered me by the weak meanes of a woman my Land-lady, who stopped him from going any further; and being demanded his name, and answering by the name of <hi>Steward,</hi> and my Land-lady telling him from mee that I knew him not, he went away chasing and saying that I should know him, before he had done with mee. But hee that knoweth God well, shall know no enemy to his hurt; neither have I ever since seene or knowen this man. I might here also write down the contents of a threatning letter from mine own Brother, when hee was Colonell for the King of <hi>England</hi> and Governour of <hi>Oxford,</hi> which I forbear with some tender consideration of flesh and blood. At the beginning of the warres I confesse I was at a stand as a Neophyt and new plant of the Church of <hi>England</hi> concerning the lawfulnesse of the warre; and so continued above a yeere in <hi>London</hi> spending my owne meanes, till at last I was fully satisfied, and much troubled to see that the Papists and most of my kindred were entertained at <hi>Oxford,</hi> and in other places of the Kings Dominions; whereupon I resolved upon a choice for the Parliament cause, which now in their lowest estate and condition I am not ashamed to acknowledge. From their hands and by their order I received a Benefice, in the which I have continued almost foure yeers preaching constantly for a through and godly Reformation intended by them, which I am ready to witnesse with the best drops of blood in my veins, though true it is I have been en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vied, jealousied and suspected by many; to whom I desire this my History may be a better witnesse of my sincerity, and that by it I may perform what our Saviour Christ spoke to <hi>Peter,</hi> saying, And thou being converted strengthen thy Brethren. I shall think my time and pen happily imployed if by what here I have written, I may strengthen the perusers of this small volume against Popish superstition whether in <hi>England,</hi> other parts of <hi>Europe, Asia,</hi> or <hi>America;</hi> for the which I shall offer up my dayly prayers unto him, who (as I may well say) miraculously brought me from <hi>America</hi> to <hi>England,</hi> and hath made use of mee as a <hi>Ioseph</hi> to discover the treasures of <hi>Egypt,</hi> or as the spies to search into the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> even the God of all Nations, to whom be ascribed by mee and all true and faithfull Beleevers, Glory, Power, Majesty and mercy for evermore.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Some words there are which are pronounced like <hi>ts,</hi> which are written not with <hi>ts,</hi> but with this letter <hi>t3,</hi> peculiar in that tongue; as for <hi>tsi,</hi> dogge, <hi>tsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quin,</hi> bird, <hi>Nutsi,</hi> my dog, <hi>Atsi,</hi> thy dog, <hi>Rutsi,</hi> his dog, <hi>Catsi,</hi> our dog, <hi>Atsita,</hi> your dog, <hi>Quitsi tacque,</hi> their dog. <hi>Nutsiquin,</hi> my bird, <hi>Atsiquin,</hi> thy bird, <hi>Rutsiquin,</hi> his bird, <hi>Catsiquin,</hi> our bird, <hi>Atsiquinta,</hi> your bird, <hi>Quitsi quintac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que,</hi> their bird.</p>
            <p>There are no severall terminations for cases, as in Latin; but the cases are distinguished with some particles or prepositions, as for example. The house of <hi>Peter, Rupat Pedro,</hi> putting the possessours name, and the particle, <hi>Ru,</hi> which is a possessive. So for the dative, add the particle <hi>Re;</hi> as for example, give to <hi>Peter</hi> his dog, <hi>Chaye re Pedro rutsi.</hi> For the accusative, when it is motion to a place, or else not, adde <hi>Chi,</hi> as for example, I goe to the house of <hi>Peter, Qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no chi rupat Pedro.</hi> The Vocative admitteth of this particle <hi>ah,</hi> or <hi>ha,</hi> of wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing or calling, as, O my son, or ho my son, <hi>Ah vacun,</hi> or <hi>ha vacun.</hi> The Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative keeping stil the same termination with the Nominative, is expressed with some preposition or other, as in my mouth, <hi>pan nuchi,</hi> with my hand, <hi>chi nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cam.</hi> In signifying I, is undeclinable, as also <hi>At,</hi> signifying you, or thou. The possessive mine, is also undeclinable, as <hi>vi chin,</hi> mine, or for me; so thine, or for thee, <hi>Ave.</hi> Where note that in this tongue there is no <hi>w,</hi> but <hi>v,</hi> or <hi>u,</hi> are pronounced as <hi>w,</hi> as though wee pronounce, <hi>wacun,</hi> my sonne, <hi>wichin,</hi> mine or for mee, <hi>Awe,</hi> thine or for thee; wee write <hi>vacun, vichin, Ave.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Particles or letters, which serve for Nounes beginning with a Vowell, are as followeth. Singular. <hi>V. Av. R.</hi> Pural. <hi>C.</hi> or <hi>Qu. Av ta. C.</hi> or <hi>qu. tacque,</hi> as for example, <hi>Acun,</hi> signifieth son, <hi>Ixim,</hi> Corn, <hi>Ochoch,</hi> likewise house, which are thus declined.</p>
            <p>Sing. <hi>Vacun,</hi> my son, <hi>Avacun,</hi> thy son, <hi>Racun,</hi> his son. Plural. <hi>Cacun,</hi> our son, <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vacunta,</hi> your son, <hi>Cacuntaque,</hi> their son.</p>
            <p>Sing. <hi>Vixim,</hi> my corn, <hi>Avixim,</hi> thy corn, <hi>Rixim,</hi> his corn. Plural. <hi>Quixim,</hi> our corn, <hi>Aviximta,</hi> your corn, <hi>Quixim tacque,</hi> their corn.</p>
            <p>Sing. <hi>Vochoch,</hi> my house, <hi>Avochoch,</hi> thy house, <hi>Rochoch,</hi> his house. Plural. <hi>Cochoch,</hi> our house, <hi>Avochochta,</hi> your house, <hi>Cochochtaque,</hi> their house.</p>
            <p>So likewise are varied or declined, <hi>Abix,</hi> signifying a plantation, or peece of ground sowen. <hi>Acal,</hi> earth or ground. <hi>Vleu,</hi> also earth or ground. <hi>Acach,</hi> hen. Save onely that the words beginning with <hi>I,</hi> admit <hi>qu,</hi> in the first and third person plurall; the rest admit for the same persons plurall, <hi>C,</hi> onely.</p>
            <p>And as thus I have observed for the varying or declining of Nounes; so also doe all the Verbes admit of severall particles for their conjugating, according as they begin either with a vowell or a consonant.</p>
            <p>Those that begin with a consonant have somewhat like the Nounes these articles following.</p>
            <p>Sing. <hi>Nu, Na, Inru.</hi> Plural. <hi>Inca, Nata, Inquitacque.</hi> As for example, <hi>locoh,</hi> to love.</p>

            <p>There is no preterimperfect tense, nor preterpluperfect tense; but the preter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect tense standeth for them; neither is there any Future, but the present tense ex presseth it, and is understood for it, according to the sense of the discourse, as <hi>Nulocoh Pedro,</hi> I love or wil love <hi>Peter. Tinulocoh,</hi> I love thee, or I wil love thee. Yet sometimes for fuller expression of the Future tense, is added this Verbe, <hi>inva,</hi> I wil, <hi>nava,</hi> thou wilt, <hi>Inra,</hi> he will, as <hi>Inva nulocoh Pedro,</hi> I will love <hi>Peter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Particles for the Preterperfect tense, are as follow:</p>
            <p>Sing. <hi>Ixnu. Xa. Ixru.</hi> Plural. <hi>Ixca. Xa ta. Ixqui tacque.</hi> Where note, that in all these particles, and in all this language, the letter <hi>X,</hi> is pronounced like <hi>sh.</hi> as <hi>Ixnu,</hi> like <hi>Ishnu. xa,</hi> like <hi>sha. Ixru,</hi> like <hi>Ishru. Ixca</hi> like <hi>Ishca,</hi> and so forth.</p>
            <p>Preterperf. Sing. <hi>Ixnulocoh,</hi> I have loved; <hi>Xalocoh</hi> thou hast loved, <hi>Ixrulocoh,</hi> he hath loved. Plural. <hi>Ixcalocoh,</hi> we have loved, <hi>Xalocohta,</hi> yee have loved, <hi>Ix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quilocohtacque,</hi> they have loved. And so of all the Verbes above.</p>
            <p>The Particles for the Imperative Mood are these following;</p>
            <p>For the singular number, and second person, <hi>Cha;</hi> for the third person singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar <hi>Chiru;</hi> for the first person plural, <hi>Chica;</hi> for the second, <hi>Cha ta,</hi> for the third <hi>Chiqui tacque:</hi> as for example. <hi>Chalocoh,</hi> love thou. <hi>Chirulocoh,</hi> let him love. Plural. <hi>Chicalocoh,</hi> let us love; <hi>Chalocohta,</hi> love yee. <hi>Chiquilotacque,</hi> let them love. And so of the rest of the Verbes above.</p>
            <p>The Optative Mood is the same with the Indicative, adding to it this Particle <hi>Ta,</hi> which signifieth as much as <hi>utinam,</hi> or, would to God, as <hi>Nalocoh ta Dios,</hi> would God thou love God; <hi>Ixnulocoh ta Dios,</hi> would God I had loved God.</p>
            <p>The Conjunctive Mood also is the same with the Indicative, adding to it this Particle, or Preposition <hi>vei,</hi> and <hi>ta,</hi> if. As for example; <hi>vei nalocoh ta Dios,</hi> if thou love God, <hi>vei ixnulocoh ta Dios,</hi> if I had loved God.</p>
            <p>There is no Infinitive Mood, but the Indicative serveth for it. As, <hi>Quinchol nutsiba,</hi> I can write. <hi>Quinquimi,</hi> signifieth to die, <hi>Nuraeh,</hi> I desire, <hi>Nuraeh quinquimi,</hi> I desire to dye.</p>
            <p>Note further, that in all Verbes Actives, when mee and thee are expressed as the Accusative case following the Verbe, they are coupled to the person that doeth or goeth before the Verbe, by these two Particles for the present tense, <hi>Quin,</hi> mee, <hi>Ti,</hi> thee. And for the preterperfect tense, <hi>xin,</hi> mee, <hi>ixti,</hi> thee. As for example.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quinalocoh,</hi> thou lovest me. <hi>Xinalocoh,</hi> thou hast loved me. <hi>Quinraalocoh,</hi> thou wilt love me. <hi>Quinalocohta,</hi> love me, or I pray God thou love me. <hi>Vei quinalo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coh,</hi> if thou love me; <hi>vei xinalocoh,</hi> if thou hast or hadst loved mee; <hi>Quinaraeh nalocoh,</hi> thou desirest to love me. So for the personbeing the Accusative. <hi>Ti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coh,</hi> I love thee. <hi>Ixtinulocoh,</hi> I have loved thee. <hi>Tiranulocah,</hi> I will love thee. <hi>Tinulocohta,</hi> pray God I love thee; <hi>vei tinulocoh,</hi> if I love thee; <hi>vei ixtinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locoh,</hi> if I have or had loved thee. <hi>Tinuraeh nulocoh,</hi> I desire to love.</p>
            <p>Note further, thathese two Verbes, <hi>Quinchol,</hi> which signifieth, I can or am able, and <hi>Inva,</hi> which signifieth I will, when they are put with other Verbes of
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:53246:114"/>
whatsoever person, they are elegantly put impersonally in the third person sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular. As for example:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Inchol nulocoh,</hi> I can love. <hi>Inra nulocoh,</hi> I will love. <hi>Ixra ixnulocoh,</hi> I have been willing to love. <hi>Ixchol ixnulocoh,</hi> I have been able to love. <hi>Tichol nulo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coh,</hi> I can love thee, <hi>Tira nulocoh,</hi> I will love thee.</p>
            <p>The Letters or Particles for Verbes beginning with a Vowell, are these that follow.</p>
            <p>Sing. <hi>Inv. Nav. inr.</hi> Plural. <hi>Inqu.</hi> or <hi>Inc. Nau ta. Inqu tacque,</hi> or <hi>Inc tacque.</hi> As for example, <hi>Eça,</hi> signifieth to deliver, which is thus formed.</p>
            <p>Sing. <hi>Inveça,</hi> I deliver. <hi>Naveça,</hi> thou deliverest, <hi>Inreça,</hi> he delivereth. Plural. <hi>Inqueça,</hi> wee deliver, <hi>Naveçata,</hi> yee deliver; <hi>Inqueça tacque,</hi> they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A</hi> is a simple signifying to wish or desire, or will a thing, which is never found without these particles.</p>
            <p>Sing. <hi>Inva,</hi> I will, <hi>Nava,</hi> thou wilt, <hi>Inra,</hi> he will; Plural. <hi>Inca,</hi> we will, <hi>Navata,</hi> yee will, <hi>Incatacque,</hi> they will. <hi>Ivereh,</hi> to heare. <hi>Invivireh,</hi> I heare. <hi>Navivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reh,</hi> thou hearest, <hi>Inrivireh,</hi> he heareth. Plural. <hi>Inquivireh,</hi> we heare; <hi>Navivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rehta,</hi> yee heare; <hi>Inquivirah tacque,</hi> they heare.</p>
            <p>Thus have I briefly set downe the way of declining all sorts of Nounes, and conjugating all sorts of Verbes of this tongue. It remaineth now that I speak of Verbes Actives; their forming and their conjugating with like Particles. The Verbes Actives being of divers terminations, are diversly formed. Commonly those that end with an <hi>A,</hi> cut off the <hi>A,</hi> in the passive, and to the last consonant add <hi>hi.</hi> As for example, <hi>Nuroca,</hi> I whip or beat, the passive is <hi>Quinrochi.</hi> So <hi>Nurapa,</hi> I whip or beat, in the passive is <hi>Quinraphi.</hi> Except <hi>Nutsiba,</hi> I write, which changeth <hi>b</hi> into <hi>m. Quintsimhi,</hi> I am written. Those that end in <hi>oh,</hi> change <hi>oh</hi> into <hi>onhi.</hi> As <hi>nulocoh,</hi> I love. <hi>Quinloconhi,</hi> I am loved. So those that end in <hi>ch,</hi> doe change <hi>ch</hi> into <hi>hi,</hi> as <hi>Invivireh,</hi> I hear, <hi>Quinivir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hi.</hi> I am heard. <hi>Nucuta,</hi> I teach, <hi>Quincuthi,</hi> I am taught, by the first rule. But those that end in <hi>ça</hi> (where note this letter <hi>ç</hi> or <hi>c,</hi> with a tittle under it, is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced like <hi>s,</hi>) change the <hi>a</hi> into <hi>ihi.</hi> As for example: <hi>inveça</hi> I deliver, <hi>Qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neçihi,</hi> I am delivered. <hi>Nucamça,</hi> I kill, <hi>Quincamcihi,</hi> I am killed: those that end in <hi>ach,</hi> adde <hi>hi</hi> in the passive, as <hi>Nuçach,</hi> I forgive, in the passive maketh <hi>Quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>çachhi,</hi> I am forgiven. The particles that vary, or conjugate the Verbes pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sives, are these following:</p>
            <p>Sing. <hi>Quin. Ti. In.</hi> Plural. <hi>Coh,</hi> or <hi>Co. Tita. Quitacque.</hi> As for example:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quinloconchi,</hi> I am loved, <hi>Tiloconhi,</hi> thou art loved. <hi>Inloconhi,</hi> hee is Plural. <hi>Coloconhi,</hi> wee are loved. <hi>Tiloconhita,</hi> yee are loved. <hi>Quiloconhitac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que,</hi> they are loved.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quinrochi,</hi> I am beaten or whipped; <hi>Tirochi,</hi> thou art beaten or whipped; <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rochi,</hi> he is beaten or whipped. Plural. <hi>Corochi,</hi> wee are beaten or whipped; <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rochita,</hi> ye are beaten or whipped; <hi>Quirochi tacque,</hi> they are beaten or whip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped.</p>
            <p>The Particles for the preterperfect tense are these following.</p>
            <p>Sing. <hi>Xin. Ixti. Ix.</hi> Plural. <hi>Xoh,</hi> or <hi>Xo. Ixti ta; xi tacque.</hi> As for example.</p>
            <p>Sing. <hi>Xinloconhi,</hi> I have bin loved. <hi>Ixtiloconhi,</hi> thou hast bin loved. <hi>Ixloconhi,</hi> hee hath been loved. Plural. <hi>Xoloconhi,</hi> wee have been loved. <hi>Ixtiloconhita,</hi> yee have been loved, <hi>Xiloconhi tacque,</hi> they have been loved. <hi>Xinrochi,</hi> I have been whipped or beaten. <hi>Ixtirochi,</hi> thou hast been whipped or beaten. <hi>Ixrochi</hi> hee hath been whipped or beaten. Plural. <hi>Xorochi,</hi> or <hi>xohrochi,</hi> we have been whip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped or beaten, <hi>Ixtarochita,</hi> ye have been whipped or beaten. <hi>Xirochi tacque,</hi> they have been whipped or beaten.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="217" facs="tcp:53246:114"/>The Imperative Mood is thus:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tiloconhi,</hi> Bee thou loved<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Chiloconho,</hi> let him bee loved Plural. <hi>Chicalo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conho,</hi> let us bee loved, <hi>Tiloconhota,</hi> bee yee loved, <hi>Chiquiloconho tacque,</hi> let them bee loved. Where you see the particle <hi>hi</hi> is changed into <hi>ho.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Optative Mood, and the Conjunctive are after the manner of the Verbs Actives, by put to <hi>ta</hi> in the Optative, and <hi>vei</hi> in the Conjunctive. As for example.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quinloconhi ta,</hi> I pray God I bee loved. <hi>Tiloconhi ta,</hi> I pray God thou bee loved; <hi>Inloconhita,</hi> I pray God hee be loved; <hi>Cohloconhita,</hi> I pray God we bee loved. <hi>Tiloconhitata,</hi> I pray God yee be loved. <hi>Quiloconhi ta tacque,</hi> I pray God they bee loved.</p>
            <p>So in the preterperfect tense <hi>ta</hi> onely is added: as for example.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Xinloconhi ta,</hi> would to God I have or had been loved. <hi>Ixtiloconhita,</hi> pray God thou hast or hadst bin loved, <hi>Ixloconhita,</hi> Pray God he have or had been loved. Plur. <hi>Xoloconhita,</hi> pray God we have or had been loved, <hi>Ixtiloconhi ta ta,</hi> I pray God ye have or had bin loved, <hi>Xiloconhi ta tacque,</hi> I pray God they have or had been loved. Where note that the particle <hi>Ta,</hi> if any other word or sentence be put with the Verb, may bee put before the Verb, as <hi>Nim ta Quinloconhi,</hi> I pray God I be greatly loved. Otherwise if the Verbe be alone, <hi>ta</hi> is placed after it.</p>
            <p>The Conjunctive Mood is thus<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Vei Quinloconhi,</hi> if I be loved, <hi>Vei tiloconhi,</hi> if thou bee loved, and so forth.</p>
            <p>This is all, which commonly is taught concerning this tongue. In which grounds hee that is perfect in, and hath a Dictionary of the severall words of it, may soone learn to speake it. As I shall understand by my best friends, that there is a desire of further printing a Dictionary, I shall satisfie their desires, and apply my self unto it. These few rules for the present I have thought fit to print, for curiosity sake, and that it may appear, how easie the <hi>Indian</hi> tongues are to be learned. I shall conclude this unparalleld work, with the Lords Prayer in that tongue, and with a brief explication of it.</p>

is put at the end for elegancy sake. <hi>Quimac</hi> is the third person plural. Where note that in a whole speech or sentence, sometimes the particle <hi>tacque,</hi> observed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove in the rule for declining is left out; and sometimes it is added. As here, <hi>quimac</hi> their sins; or else it might have been <hi>quimac tacque.</hi>

               <hi>Xim acquivi chi quih,</hi> that have sinned against our backs, of <hi>Mac,</hi> signifying sin, is this Verbe formed, <hi>quinmacquivi,</hi> to sin.

This Verbe <hi>quinmacquivi</hi> is a Deponent; of which sort there are many in that tongue, as <hi>quincutani,</hi> to preach, which have the same Particles as the Verbes Passives. <hi>Chiquih</hi> is a word compounded of the Preposition <hi>chi<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> and <hi>ih,</hi> which signifieth back, an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

And if another third person bee named, <hi>chirih,</hi> standeth for against, as <hi>chirih Pedro,</hi> against <hi>Peter,</hi> that is, against the back. If many be named in the third person Plural, then <hi>chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quih</hi> is used, as <hi>chiquih unche,</hi> or <hi>chiquih cunch elal,</hi> against all.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Macoacana,</hi> leave us not. This Verbe is here compounded of three: first, <hi>Ma,</hi> is abbreviated from the word <hi>mani,</hi> which signifieth no or not, as likewise <hi>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chucu. Co</hi> or <hi>coh,</hi> signifieth wee or us, and as in the rules before I have obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, is put here before the Verb; which causeth <hi>then</hi> to be cut off from the verb, which otherwise should have beene <hi>nacana,</hi> of <hi>nucana,</hi> I leave, <hi>nacana,</hi> thou leavest, <hi>inrucana,</hi> he leaveth, and so forth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Chipam catacchihi,</hi> in our being tempted. This is another great elegancy in that tongue to use a Verbe Passive for a Noune, and to add to it a Preposition; as here, <hi>chipam,</hi> which signifieth in; and putting to the Verbe the Particles wherewith the Nounes are varied and declined. <hi>Nutacchih,</hi> signifieth I tempt. The Passive is <hi>quintacchihi,</hi> I am tempted; from whence <hi>n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>
               <hi>Coaveçata china unche tsiri.</hi> Deliver us from all evill things. <hi>Inveça,</hi> as I have noted before, signifyeth to deliver. <hi>Co</hi> is the first person Plural put before the Verbe, as I observed in the rule above, and in that Conjunction or compound <hi>macoacana. China</hi> is a Preposition, signifying above or from. <hi>Unche,</hi> signifieth all, which is undeclinable. <hi>tsiri,</hi> is an Adjective properly undeclinable also or unvariable, in Gender, Case, and Number; as are all Adjectives in that tongue. It signifieth evill or bad; as <hi>tsiri vinac,</hi> an evill man, <hi>tsiri ixoc,</hi> a bad woman, <hi>tsiri chicop,</hi> a bad or evill beast; so likewise in the Plural number it is the same. Without a Substantive it is as the Newter Gender, as <hi>malum</hi> for <hi>malares,</hi> sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying an evill thing, or evill things.

               <hi>Mani quiro,</hi> not good: this is put for a further expression of evils to be delivered from whatsoever is not good. <hi>Mani,</hi> as I noted before, signifieth not. <hi>Quiro,</hi> is as <hi>tsiri,</hi> an Adjective, signifying good or a good thing, and is undeclinable, unva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riable in both numbers. <hi>Quiro vinac,</hi> a good man, <hi>quiro ixoc,</hi> a good woman, <hi>quiro chicop,</hi> a good beast; so likewise in the plural number, <hi>quiro vinac,</hi> good men. The Substantive that is derived from this Adjective, is, <hi>quirohal,</hi> goodness<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Chiohal,</hi> signifieth the same. <hi>quirolah,</hi> is very good, <hi>tsirilah,</hi> very bad, where <hi>lah</hi> is added at the end of an adjective, it puts the same aggravation as <hi>valde</hi> in <hi>Latin.</hi>
