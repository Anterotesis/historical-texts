            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <salute>Gentlemen,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Am not much lifted up, or caſt down at the news you ſend me, for that my Letter ſhould be liked by ſome, and as ill taken by others, is but the fate of all things offer'd to publick cenſure; tho without vanity, the reaſons are unequal. But before I enter upon that, you'l give me leave to obſerve the humor of the Party in the Proverbs you ſent me, that methinks looks ſo much like a <hi>Green Ribband,</hi> that it hardly becomes the fall of the leaf, they conceit they are under. You ſay, the uſual anſwer to the Letter is this; <hi>There is a Snake in the Graſs; All is well that ends well,</hi> That a more moderate ſort, allow it both <hi>witt and truth, but ill timed, conſidering the Melancholy circumſtances the Church of England is under.</hi> To all this, you have here my anſwer, which I beſeech you to communicate with that Cander; that you know has alwayes been the companion of my Life. And for the Proverbs, I muſt ſay firſt, that a wiſe Sentence, may be ſillily apply'd; and next, I am apt to think that theſe are ſo; for pray what is the <hi>Snake,</hi> and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:106228:3"/>
where doe's it lie. A <hi>Snake</hi> without a <hi>Sting</hi> hurts no body, let it lie where it will; and a <hi>Snake</hi> with a <hi>Sting</hi> is dangerous every where. Now to find out who is the <hi>Snake,</hi> let's conſider what's the Sting, The <hi>Penal Laws</hi> certainly; and you are not ignorant who's Tayle they belong to. But to be ſure they Sting all that won't come to Church, and that every where. For a man can't walk in his own Land, mow his own Graſs, enjoy his own Shop, Barn, Chamber, Cloſet, Cheſt or Cubbard; no not his Pot, Pan or Skillet, but the <hi>Snake</hi> will get into it, and when it has ſwept his Fields and Houſe clean with its Tayle, by the Teeth it draws him to its dark Holes and Dungeons for a further Prey. The Hiſtory of this <hi>Snake</hi> out-does all the Giants of the old World, and it had been happy it had periſh't with it: Wherefore <hi>Liberty of Conſcience</hi> is ſo far from being the <hi>Snake in the Graſs,</hi> that there is in it neither Snake, Teeth, Sting, or Graſs to hide them. On the contrary, it ſpies out the Snake, cuts the Graſs, ketches it, and pulls out the Sting, that it may do no more miſchief: 'Tis upon this Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple that one Party cannot hurt 'tother. And for the other Proverb, 'tis certain, <hi>All's well that ends well,</hi> but for that reaſon all will end ill that begins ſo, without Repentance. And ſuch beginnings I call <hi>Penal Laws</hi> for Religion, let who will make them, or
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:106228:3"/>
uſe them. And I beſeech God to touch the Hearts of the Church of <hi>England</hi> with a ſence of this; for his Juſtice we can't Corrupt. All Parties as well as private Perſons will meet with their own from him; 'tis a Decree as old as the World, ſtamp't in our Natures, and prov'd by the Records of all time, and God knows but too plainly in ours.</p>
            <p>But ſince theſe Gentlemen are upon their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verbs, with their leave I will oppoſe a couple to them, and I hope a little better ſuited. <hi>Let every Tub ſtand upon its own Bottom;</hi> and <hi>A Bird in the Hand is worth two in the Buſh.</hi> Theſe are the Texts, I'le now give you the Comment. By the firſt, I mean, that the Government ſhould ſtand upon its own Legs, and the Church upon hers. The Legs of the civil Government, is the civil Intereſt of the Government, which is that of all the People under it, ſo that the Government is obleiged to ſecure all, becauſe all are for their own Intereſt bound to ſecure it: For the Church in Queſtion, of which all the People are not Members, nor yet the greateſt part, is a thing of another Nature, and relates to another World, and Chriſt has provided her another Bottom, if ſhe really makes his Law the rule of her Actions and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority. <hi>Let every one walk as he is perſwaded,</hi> was divine Doctrine in St <hi>Paul</hi>'s time, <hi>and our Glo<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

was to be in our ſelves, and not in another; and we were to ſtand and fall to our own Maſters,</hi> and not Judge, much leſs Perſecute others, no, not <hi>Tares,</hi> for they were to grow with the <hi>Wheat,</hi> (tho never like to change their Nature) till the Harveſt, which our Saviour In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprets, <hi>the end of the World</hi>: And the Apoſtle tells us, <hi>Every One muſt appear before God, and give an Account for the Deeds done in the Body</hi>; ſo that you ſee the Proverb is true, that <hi>every Tub ought to ſtand upon its own bottom.</hi> For the other, 'tis as obvious &amp; reaſonable in this caſe; for why ſhould it be taken ill that the Poor Fanaticks accept the Liberty the Church of <hi>England</hi> refus'd, and has driven them to ſuch extreamities for. She would have them to ſtay till ſhe can give what ſhe would not when ſhe had power to do it. Nay, ſhe has it ſtill, &amp; yet will not for a reaſon that expoſes them more then before. But which way can ſhe enſure it to them? <hi>Firſt,</hi> Can they with Honour or Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence refuſe what they have ſought, or reject that by Declaration the Church of <hi>England</hi> will not allow by Law? <hi>Secondly,</hi> How are they aſſurd, while the Church of <hi>England</hi> is by Law ſecured, that by thoſe very Laws they ſhall not be ruin'd in the mean time? Is it not natural enough to expect at the hand of the King, that they will not, ſhall not have Liberty of Conſcience? and that at any
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:106228:4"/>
rate, they ſhall conform thorowly, that will not at an other time conform at all, When they do it now only to bob the Goverment? But what is Faction if this be not? If conform, why juſt now? If now, why not before? If not before, why then now? if things are the ſame, why are not they? and if they are, that is, if their opinion of the Diſcipline and Ceremonies of the Church be what it was, they can't be honeſt men and conform: They may ſet up for men of Art, and Managers, that have given by their own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences ſuch a proof of their skill; but I ſhould la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment extreamly any Diſſenter in <hi>England</hi> ſhould have ſo little wit or truth. And to be free, it would not look Candid in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> that gives her fear of Poperies having the Power to deſtroy others, for the reaſon of her keeping the Penal Laws on foot, if ſhe takes it ill, that the Diſſenters are for the ſame reaſon for their repeal; for ſhe can't but think that Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery actually has that Power over them, by the Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertunity of the Laws ſhe will manintain to ſecure herſelf. So that light and darkneſs are not more oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite then the ſafety of the <hi>Diſſenters,</hi> and the reaſon the Church of <hi>England</hi> gives for the keeping up the <hi>Penal Laws</hi> for her own. To remove this Difficulty, and to make the methods of their ſecurity meet, has, God knows, been my only drift, that ſo falſe Notions of
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:106228:5"/>
Preſervation might not deſtroy us, when the means of our common ſafety are ſo obvious to us.</p>
            <p>The general and deep Prejudices men entertain againſt <hi>Popery</hi> will hardly ſuffer them to diliberate for their own benefit. If a Ship be near a Rock, I think the danger ſhould not frighten away the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters wits, when he has moſt need of them for a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Safety. I beg the Gentlemen of the Church of <hi>England</hi> but to think, and I am Sure they will find me leſs Criminal in my other Letter to you: For is any thing truer then that the <hi>Papiſts</hi> court a legal Eaſe? need they this, if they deſign Force? or were it worth their Labouring? Again, cannot a Law be made to fix <hi>Liberty of Conſcience,</hi> that they ſhall as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſily violate, as theſe the Church calls her Bulwark? If the Laws in Question were defenſive only, God forbid that I ſhould attempt to leſſen her ſecurity, I declare in the preſence of God I would not; but when they are offenſive and deſtroying to other People, and thoſe of the moſt peaceable Principles, who have neither Intereſt nor Arts to defend them, ſhe muſt Pardon me if I oppoſe my ſelf to their Teeth and Sting. It is alſo as true that her Diſſenters are of no uſe to her unleſs theſe Shackles are taken off; That if ſhe does not fear <hi>Liberty</hi> more then <hi>Popery,</hi> ſhe muſt yeild the point deſired for their ſake, becauſe her own.
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:106228:5"/>
That for every Enemy ſhe releaſes by it, ſhe has an hundred Friends to ſecure her againſt Him. That ſhe muſt remember ſhe is but a part of the whole, and ſhould not flatter her ſelf with Numbers not of her Communion; eſpecially while they ſleep with naked Swords hanging by Hairs over their Heads, and ſo are made uncapable to ſerve her.</p>
            <p>Again, pray, can ſhe think that force becomes a Goſpel Church? that it is not uſing againſt Popery what ſhe accuſes it for, and by it condemns her ſelf? Is it not taking Sanctuary in human Strength inſtead of divine Truth, that is al-ſufficient to its own ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port? That the Laws that remain, ſecure the State, and if any be wanting, they may be added without keeping up the Ball of Vengeance by partial Proviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, directed by one Party, of the ſame People, againſt an other, under one and the ſame Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; for this is puzling, not ſerving Government: Nor can any be great, eaſie or ſucceſsful where the <hi>Heads</hi> and <hi>Hands,</hi> that ſhould make it ſo, are zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly diſabled from that Duty and Service. It ſeems a day wherein God is pleaſed to make uſe of the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities of Men to effect what Vertue and Wiſdom ſhould have taught us long ago to have done; Agree I mean upon our civil common Intereſt.</p>
            <p>And now we have a King, who has ſo gracious a
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:106228:6"/>
regard to <hi>Liberty,</hi> (and that chuſes to recommend himſelf by ſo honeſt, ſo tender and ſo equal a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, and whoſe own Party, tho they may want it moſt hereafter, do leaſt need it now, and are the moſt feeble in number to make the uſe of it dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to the reſt) let us by no means looſe the opper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of our own Happineſs. Nor can the Church of <hi>England</hi> refuſe me my Petition to her, but upon this ſingle account, <hi>the Inſincerity of the King</hi>; that muſt be her <hi>Snake in the Graſs, that Popery's at the Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom; Mark the end of this Liberty; All's well that ends well</hi>: But this plainly implies my Arguments to be good, and that if the King holds as he begins, we ſhall all be happy. Lets ſee then why he ſhould not do ſo, tho it looks very ill in the high Sons of the Church to blow upon that Honour they have ſo often and ſo highly recommended for our Security. <hi>Firſt,</hi> The King has given her his Word to maintain her at his coming to the Crown, and has now repeated it to her for the whole time of his Reign, in the moſt ſolemn manner that was poſſible out of Parliament, <hi>Secondly,</hi> If he be willing, to turn this Promiſe into a Law at the repeal of thoſe he would aboliſh when they meet, and that to be ſure he is ready to do, there can be no room to doubt his Sincerity. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> He is compell'd to be ſincere, for <hi>Popery</hi> without him is
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:106228:6"/>
but a Name in <hi>England,</hi> and Lives by him, and muſt otherwiſe expect to expire with him. So that if it were poſſible for the People of his Communion to prevail with him to force his Religion upon the Kingdom, tho I think it as impracticable, <hi>as to ſet Weſtminſter-Abby upon Bow-Steeple</hi>; he muſt leave them to make ſatisfaction for the attempt in the next Reign; Or conclude, he never intends his Lawful Heirs to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed him: And they muſt take him for the worſt of men to be guilty of an Injuſtice and Irreligion he has ſo often and ſolemnly, and earneſtly ſpoken againſt. But if that were no ſecurity to us, yet the ruin of thoſe that in all probability muſt follow that attempt, for whoſe ſakes we ſuppoſe him to endanger us, would obliege him to the ſoft &amp; obleiging methods he now takes. So that we have his Honour, Conſcience, Nature, and the Security of his own Party for Ours. Come, 'tis Diſingenious to call Liberty of Conſcience <hi>the Snake in the Graſs,</hi> that like the Balm of <hi>Gillead</hi> cures the Gaps and Sores that Time and private Intereſts have made. And ſince he offers to confirm it by Law, <hi>HE ON<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LY CHANGES THE SEC<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>RITY, HE DOES NOT DESTROY IT;</hi> and which is more ſhe is a gainer by it: For whereas ſhe is now the National Religion by Compulſion <hi>ſhe will then keep her Station by Conſent;</hi> both extreams yeilding a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferrence
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:106228:7"/>
to her, and ſo ſhe is neither hated nor envied by them.</p>
            <p>I would have her further reflect, that the keeping the <hi>Penal Laws</hi> on foot will not anſwer the end ſhe does it for, ſince ſhe believes they will be ſuſpended during the time ſhe fears moſt, and of the next Reign, ſhe has no apprehenſion, and in the mean time ſhe and the <hi>Proteſtant Diſſenters</hi> have the Hands. So that the only reaſon for maintaining them, is the <hi>Awe</hi> they ought to give the <hi>Papiſts</hi> in this Kings time, and yet if what ſhe ſuggeſts be true, <hi>that the Papiſts aim at all,</hi> pray, how far will thoſe Laws awe them, that for that reaſon ſhould rather aim at all. I ſay, what good will that do her, that muſt be the greateſt Argument of the Force ſhe fears they will uſe againſt her? and if they have no ſuch deſign, there is no reaſon to keep them in awe, but much to ſoften and engage them, that we may all meet upon our common civil Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, and as one People with one Heart Fear God, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter our own Perſwaſion; Honour the King, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to our Allegiance; and Love and Serve one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as becomes the Members of the great civil Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of this Kingdom.</p>
            <p>But ſome, you tell me, think it had been bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>The Laws where Repealed in a Pro<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

this; for that's the Queſtion. Let us ſuppoſe ours were a Proteſtant, and they were repealed according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. How could we aſſure our ſelves our next Heir would not turn; Ay, the Prince in Poſſeſſion? And unleſs the Principles of Excluſion prevail'd, 'tis clear the Delemma would be the ſame, becauſe the ſecurity upon that notion is uncertain. I confeſs it had been better for us, it had been done before his coming to the Crown, but ſince he forgives us that deficiency, and offers to ſupply it, in ways the moſt aſſuring, why it ſhould not be good to do it now I cannot imagine: It is to ſay, it is not fit to be done, when it is moſt fit to make us beſt with him. We will have him truſt us, but we will not truſt him, where his intereſt Secures us.</p>
            <p>Well, but you add, <hi>That it is generally agreed, the Penal Laws ſhould he repeal'd, but not the Teſts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I muſt tell you, I do not agree with you in that Fact; for I hear there are divers Schiſms in the Church about it: Some for their repeal, and keeping of the Teſts: Some for repealing neither: Some for their repeal to Papiſts only: Some for Diſſenters only; And a few for a general Repeal of both; ſo that the Church is yet unreſolved what to do: But I will attend the great Queſtion.</p>
            <p>For the Penal Laws, no matter if they go; <hi>but if
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:106228:8"/>
the Teſts be repealed too, the Government is loſt to the Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts; for they may pack a Parliament of their own Religion, that in all Probability will make it national; and ſo Liberty of Conſcience will not ſerve them, nor ſave us.</hi> You ſee I am fair in the Objection, Ile give you my Anſwer as freely.</p>
            <p>I cannot imagine the Councils that engage them to take a fair way, can lead them to be foul in it; for that's giving a pail of Milk, and kicking it down with their foot. If they had number to chuſe, or could be returned without it, they muſt naturally ſearch the moſt durable means of their ſafety: Now, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be making their Religion national, both becauſe they are not the two hundred and fiftieth man, and that the attempt would eternally ruin them with the Kingdom, whoſe kindneſs, in a future Raign, their diſcreeter Conduct in this muſt ſecure. Nor could any thing be ſo odious, faithleſs and immoral, then for them to attempt it; for if ever they ſhould teach the Nation that Arithmatick, that thirteen is more then three and twenty, they will make <hi>True Prophets</hi> of thoſe they have taken pains to prove <hi>Falſe Witneſſes.</hi> But beſides their Diſcretion and Intereſt, the Kings Faith is given us, for his whole Raign, in his Great and Gratious Declaration, that he will not exceed the bounds of Liberty of Conſcience. By This, every Party
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:106228:8"/>
is ſecured with his in their Religion and Property; and This tyes him againſt any concurrance with the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple repreſentatively, contrary to this made to them univerſally: We may aſſure our ſelves, he is not like to break it in either of thoſe reſpects, ſince we don't think that will ſo eaſily become the Religion of the Kingdom, or that whileſt the People are of another, they will chuſe a Repreſentative of the <hi>Roman Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Laſtly, the Law that ſhall repeal theſe Laws, may be ſo drawn, as to make it impracticable to return a Parliament that is not choſen; as well as I dare ſay, it is below the Glory of our King, to uſe ways ſo unlike the reſt of his Open and Generous Principles.</p>
            <p>My former Argument was <hi>ad homenem,</hi> for, what ever the Church of <hi>England</hi> men think, 'tis certain, the Anſwer they gave for a Popiſh Succeſſor, <hi>we muſt truſt God and do our Duty,</hi> is ſtill Cogent. For if Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence was ſtrong enough to ſecure us then againſt our fears of ſuch a Succeſſor, can an Act of Parliament, be a better Defence to us now. I fear ſuch are fallen from their Faith, and change their Devotion, for car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſecurities. Let us be all of a piece<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> not hot and then cold; one while for relying on Providence, and another time jealous to death, and beating our Brains for ſafety, as if there were no ſuch thing as God in the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:106228:9"/>
World. The Queſtion is not about the King's impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing his Religion upon us; for ſo I ſhould have almoſt ador'd the Gentlemen that left their imployments; but whether we will not impoſe our Religion upon the Friends of his Communion; and this ſhows no bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gottry in the King, that he gives all Parties Liberty to muſter &amp; exerciſe themſelves according to their own Principles, that he knows to be ſo very contrary to his: An odd way of advancing Popery, eſpecially by foul play. I wiſh any thing would ſatifie us. And yet after ſo gratious a Declaration, both to Church and Diſſenters, and that has ſo decent a regard to the concurrance of a <hi>Parliament</hi> too, Who can be diſpleaſed? Have we been Hunting, Hawking Gaming, and Marrying with <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> theſe ſix and twenty Years! and did they engage on the ſame ſide for the King's Father, help to ſupport the King abroad, and labour the Reſtoration of the Royal Family to their Inheritance; and are we now afraid of them for the Religion they had then, or that they ſhould have a few Offices with us, in the Reign of a Prince of their own way, that were the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions of our ſufferings and Pleaſures? methinks it looks ill natur'd at all times, and indiſcreet at this; ſince 'tis certain we may roundly and ſecurely tell them, You are upon your good behaviour: Be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate at your perril: You are but a morfel of men;
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:106228:9"/>
and therefore as little feared as loved: 'Tis in your own power to be well with the Kingdom: Know when you have enough; and let us ſee you aim at no more then ſecuring your civil Property and Intereſt in that of the Nation, from any violence, on the ſcore of Religion, and that meer matters of Faith and Worſhip of God ſhall diſable no man of his Birth-right. This Bottom is broad enough for all the intereſts of this <hi>Kingdom</hi> to meet upon; and till God from Heaven ſend us with miracles an higher Principle of Union; let us not neglect this lower, but ſure means of our Peace and Happineſs.</p>
            <p>To Conclude, let us have a care of the <hi>Snake</hi> eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where; in the <hi>Graſs,</hi> in the <hi>Square,</hi> in the <hi>Coffee-Houſe,</hi> in the <hi>Church,</hi> ay, and in the <hi>Meeting-Houſe</hi> too; for 'tis ill company at all times, and in all places. Let us remember that not only the <hi>four,</hi> but the <hi>ſeven</hi> laſt Raigns have prov'd <hi>Penal Laws</hi> an Enemy to the Peace and Wealth of the Kingdom, and the <hi>ſtricteſt Teſts</hi> no Security to the Government of it againſt the weight of its own miſcarriages. Let us forgive one another, and look forward. I am for having the Church of <hi>England</hi> keep the Chair, but let the reſt ſubſiſt. To fix Government upon any <hi>Mode</hi> of Religion, convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes it as often as that changes, at leaſt hazards it.
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:106228:10"/>
That which takes in all Intereſts is the beſt foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for any Government, becauſe it is leaſt expoſed to State Contingencies. Let us then bend our thoughts towards ſuch an expedient as may ſecure <hi>Property</hi> to all, the firſt reaſon of civil Government, and that which every Party for its own Intereſt muſt cloſe with. Three things ſtrictly ſpeaking make an Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh man <hi>Ownerſhip, Conſent in Parliament, and Right of Juries.</hi> We all know what Laws have been made, and by whom to deſtroy theſe ſeveral Capacities, that frame an Engliſh man; amongſt which, pray let not that againſt <hi>Conventicles</hi> go for the leaſt! Let us ſee then what it is that diveſts us of theſe Native Priviledges, and like true Engliſh men, &amp; Chriſtians, let us remove it; that in the Raign, of a King ſo ready to diſapoint the Enemies of his Glory, by repairing the Breaches of his People, and of the old true civil Government of his Kingdom, we may not be wanting to our ſelves and our Poſterity, in another <hi>Great Charter,</hi> to bury all our Prejudices, and Eſtabliſh a laſting Civil union among the Inhabitants of this Ancient and Famous Kingdom.</p>
