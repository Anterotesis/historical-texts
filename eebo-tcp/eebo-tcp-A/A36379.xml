            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Am now by the death of the Earle of Manchester, through His Majesties speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all favour invested with the keeping of the Privy Seale, an Office of which I have had long the reversion, and by the possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it I am intituled to one of the supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mest places of judicature in the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome; made Judge, <hi>ex officio,</hi> of the second Court of Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in England, namely, the Court of Requests instituted by that <hi>Solomon</hi> of our Nation, <hi>Henry</hi> the seventh for the ease and reliefe of the Subject, tyred with the tedious processe of suites in Chancery: And surely, in the Earle of Manchesters time, the Court of Requests had few lesse suites depending in it, through the industry and equity of the man, then the Chancery it selfe. So perfectly was he skilled in all the nici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the Lawes, having passed through all the signall offices of the gowne in this kingdome. And surely, my Lords, it will
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:54503:3"/>
be a hard matter for me, who am not so well versed in the Lawes, to governe that Province so exactly as my Predeces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor; yet sure I shall make it the supreamest end of my endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, to performe my charge, though not with so much Law as he did, yet with as much conscience. Conscience, which as it is the fountaine from which all good Lawes are deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, ought to be used in administration of those Lawes; and that I shall not faile in, but faithfully accomplish the trust im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed on me by His sacred Majesty, and performe right to the Subject, according as right it selfe shall direct me.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>My Lords,</hi> I could never like the over-severity of those Judges, who by a modest tyranny, authorized by custome, strive to lengthen their rule over wretched men, by an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite processe of formall orders, detaining the Causes of Cly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents so long in their Courts, till that which should rectiifie and settle the breaches and cavils in mens estates the Law it selfe, consumes them: Very many persons of good ability be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning suites for sleight matters, in the meere Law costs ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending the best part of their fortunes. And is it not a thing much to be lamented, that the Law, which ought to be the repressor and composer of injuries, should prove to the party injured a greater injury then the injury it selfe? That the cure of a disease should carry in it a more lingring and fatall malady then the disease it selfe? Surely Judges and too many such there are or have been, forget that Goddesse, under whose suffrage they should pronounce sentence, I meane justice; when they suffer the poore Clyents to be so grated, as it were to powder by the Lawyers. Themselves, though they dare not openly prostitute faire justice, virgin white<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, yet doe they adulterate her purity by <hi>proxie,</hi> having their Factors to vent that commodity, which indeed should not be bought for silver or gold, Justice; but now,

when people must pay for that which is their right, or else be oppressed with injury, so that that Devill money, hath usur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped the seat and heavenly countenance of that Angell Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice. The Egyptians in their Hieroglyphicks deciphered ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice under the figure of an Elephant; the nature of that beast for his strength being aptest to carry great burthens: in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timating thereby, that on the backe of justice all the weight of the Common-wealth should be imposed, it being the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly supporter of its welfare. But weake must that pillar be which hath so infirme a basis to rely on, as is injustice, nor can there be a more eminent wrong to the Subject, then to make poore men from the furthest parts of this kingdome, comming to London about Law-businesse, wait there, or come up thither Terme by Terme for divers yeares; no, nor a greater detriment to their estates. I was once in minde therefore (if it had pleased God, that we who are servants to his Majesty, had continued at London) to have made it a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the High Court of Parliament, for passing a definitive sentence with His Majesties consent against this tedious prorogation and delaying of suites; but the more are the times to be lamented, that this, nor any Law else of conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence for the good of the Subject can be enacted, by reason of these civill uncivill wars and differences betwixt His sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Majesty, and His High Court of Parliament. Were those reconciled by a faire and happy unity, I should with much joy and alacrity of spirit enter upon this honourable office, and mannage it so, as I should discharge a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science to God, the duty of a true subject to my Prince, and the honesty &amp; integrity of a Judge, to those who have Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses depending before me. But I should seeme too much my owne Trumpet, did not your selves, my Lords, in your candid dispositions beleeve what I have uttered; which when it shall please God and His Majesty, that I have occasion, am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, as my predecessor did, to execute my office, I shall by my actions give warrantable proofe to what I have now ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered.</p>

            <head>Another <hi>SPEECH</hi> spoken by the said Earle to His <hi>MAJESTY</hi> when he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted President of His Councell.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He favours your Majesty in your Royall bounty hath so frequently conferred upon me, so far transcend the meannesse of my desert, that certainly I begin to accuse my modesty for accepting them, and should absolutely condemne it, without allowing it the benefit of its Clergie, did not your Majesties sacred commands acquit it, which must needs prevaile above all respects of my selfe upon my obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and adapt my weaknesse and inabilities for my im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments in your Majesties service, which hath, and ever shall be, the only centre of my intentions: Your Royall good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, like the Sunnes vertuall beams, actuating my dull capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city for the discharging any place your gracious bounty shall cast upon me. And though your Majesty might have found out other Noble men my Peers, who would have complied this charge of President of your Majesties Councell with more dexterity; yet I dare boldly promise for my selfe, that none amongst them should have performed it with more care and fidelity. The Councell of Kings are in the hands of the Almighty; and those that are of their Councels, ought to regulate their thoughts and actions so for the service of their Masters, as they shall not be esteemed mere Polititians, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king in the gentlenesse and suavity of their natures for their owne ends, but aiming perpetually at the common good, which must needs conduce to the good of the Soveraigne.
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:54503:4"/>
Councellers that erre out of this path, are rather to be termed seducers, and as such should be punished, being indeed meere <hi>Achitophels,</hi> crafty and malicious. And I must needs here deplore the present condition of your sacred Majesty (in my sorrow for your Royall disasters I expresse my hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble gratitude for your bounties;) your high Court of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, from which you are departed hither, being of a settled opinion, as appeares by their Declarations, that all the machine of evills, that like so many furies fly through your Highnesse Dominons, have taken their originall from the perswasions of bad Councellors; if any such there be, or have beene about your sacred Majesty, I shall most humbly pray for their removall or conversion from such sinister practises, and thinke my selfe (my integrity shall gaine a remission for my boldnesse) ingaged in duty and conscience to informe your sacred Majesty, that till such Councellors be removed from your gracious eares, there will never be any hopes that the distractions of your Kingdomes can be setled, the wounds of which it hath so long bled be imbal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, much lesse perfectly cured: For how can your Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, the grand and supreme Councell of your Kingdome, comply with the desires of your Majesty, when they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture whatever they shall desire of your Majesty for your peoples welfare shall be thwarted &amp; nullified by the intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of some few private cabinet Councellors, which was the reason I conjecture of their humble addresses to your Grace for the settling the election of your Councellors in the power of the Common-wealth, namely, in the trieniall Parliament. The Councellors to Kings, if they should have the misfortune to prove ill ones, having the Subjects safety at their mercy, by the Royall authority which is then most splendent, when it is most concurrent with the peoples pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperities, and imployed for their defence, and patronage against the oppression of evill Councellors; who by their subtile and malignant practises, doe oft-times, as it were, transforme the hearts of their Soveraignes from their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive

and genuine candor and sweetnesse; by that meanes rendring their rules odious to their Subjects: <hi>Oderunt quia metuunt,</hi> they alwayes detest what they are afeard of, every man naturally hating that which they conceive will hurt them: but your Majesties owne wisdome, and the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent skill your Royall knowledge hath in discerning and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fining dispositions, must of necessity secure your raigne (which heaven long continue over us) from the disease of such pernicious Councellors; it being impossible that your gracious disposition (though it may be deluded <hi>sub appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentia bo<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
