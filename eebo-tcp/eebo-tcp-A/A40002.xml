         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>AMong all the Plagues and Puniſhments Almighty God is pleaſed to inflict upon Mankind for Sin, there are three which ſeem more grievous and intol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable than the reſt, <hi>viz.</hi> the Sword, Peſtilence, and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine; of which three, when King <hi>David</hi> had offended God, in numbring the People, and was put to his choice, in what kind he would be puniſhed for it, choſe the Peſtilence, as the leaſt of the three; (which truly it is, all Circumſtances being conſidered) and of the other two, there is none (I think) but had rather dye in the Field, by the Sword of his Enemy, than be pined and ſtarved to death, by the bitterneſs of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine. Now, as a good Prince will endeavour, what he can poſsible, to preſerve his Country from War, and the Sword, ſo far as stands beſt with the ſafety of Himſelf, and his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. And, as a good Phyſician, will (or at leaſt ſhould) take as much care to preſerve the Health, and prevent the Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his Patients, as to Cure them when they are ſick: So, it is the Duty of every good Houſholder, in times of Plenty, to provide for his Family, againſt times of Scarcity and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, the greateſt Judgement of the three. For the better, and more eaſie effecting whereof, I have, in this ſmall Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe, publiſhed ſuch a Secret, whereby every man, in the
<pb facs="tcp:109070:4"/>
greateſt times of Dearth and Scarcity, may have excellent, good and wholeſome Bread, and other kinds of Food, for their Families, at as cheap Rates, as now in times of Plenty; which if well made uſe of, I doubt not, but it will prove more effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uall against Scarcity, and a Famine, than the beſt Alexite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rium, or Antidote, againſt the Infection of the Plague. And ſince it hath pleaſed God, to deliver ſuch a Talent to my keeping, I was willing (not to hide it in the Earth, or wrap it up in a Napkin, but) to improve it, as well as I could; which I hope I have done, by publiſhing of it, that thou, Loving Reader, mayeſt know it, make uſe of it, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the benefit of it; deſiring nothing for my Pains and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour herein, but thy kind Acceptation; which if I ſhall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, I ſhall be the more encouraged hereafter, (according to my Power and Ability (further to ſerve thee, in whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Civility and Humanity commands.</p>

Theſe Roots, although they came at firſt from the <hi>Indies,</hi> yet thrive and proſper very well in <hi>Ireland,</hi> where there is whole Fields of them; from
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:109070:5"/>
whence they have been brought into <hi>Wales,</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the North Parts of <hi>England,</hi> where they likewiſe proſper and increaſe exceedingly.

<pb n="4" facs="tcp:109070:6"/>
into leſſer pieces, leaving alwayes upon every piece one Bud at leaſt, which you may perceive in the little cavities here and there upon the Roots; and thus a great deal of Ground may be planted with a few Roots; which about the beginning of <hi>May</hi> thruſt forth their Leaves; the Flowers being of a white Colour, bud forth in the end of <hi>June;</hi> the Fruit or Berry comes not to maturity in our Climate, but is for the moſt part alwayes green.

            <p>In the Digging, you muſt obſerve, that all the very ſmall Roots, and all the little pieces of Roots, muſt be left in the Ground, that it may be ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently ſtored the next year.

                  <note place="margin">To make Bread of <hi>Potatoes.</hi>
                  </note>THe firſt and greateſt Uſe of <hi>Potatoes</hi> is for the  making of Bread, which I doubt not but will be of much benefit to all ſorts of people, eſpecially to the Poor in times of ſcarcity: And indeed, this was the chief Cauſe both of the Invention and Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication hereof. For having ſeen how much poor people have ſuffered, and what great Complaints they have ſometimes made, by reaſon of the dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Corn, and the ſlender relief which they found at the hands of thoſe who were able enough to help them; I began to think with my ſelf, what means might be uſed, to prevent the like for the future: And knowing the Nature, and great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of this Root, I made trial thereof for the making of Bread; and by the bleſſing of God, it ſucceeded according to my deſire. I then planted of them, and afterwards for two years together I made further trial of them, and found that they might be put to divers other good uſes, which in love to my native Country, and for the good of the Poor, I have here ſet down, beginning with the way and manner of making Bread therewith, which is as followeth.</p>
               <p>If you will bake a Buſhel, you ſhall take half a Buſhel of theſe Roots, and putting them into two little Nets, which is a Peck into each Net, boyl them in a Kettle of water till they break between your fingers, but let them not break in the boyling;
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:109070:7"/>
when they have boyled a quarter of an hour, in which time they will be boyled enough, take out the Nets, with the Roots, and hang them up a while, that the water may drain from them; then put them out into a wier Sieve, made for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, being almoſt as thick as a courſe hair Sieve, and ſtrengthened with three or four ſtrong Wiers, or ſmall Iron Rods, over-thwart the bottom; and with an Iron Truel let them be all broken, and rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed through the bottom of the Sieve, into a Veſſel underneath; by which means the Skins of the Roots will remain behind, and the Meal will paſs through, being much like unto boyled Rice. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you put the Roots into the Nets, you muſt cut the great ones into halves or quarters, otherwiſe the ſmall ones will be boyled to pieces, before the great ones are boyled enough.</p>
               <p>The Roots being thus prepared, you may make Bread of them after this manner. You muſt take as much Wheat or Barley Flower as your half Buſhel of <hi>Potato</hi> Meal weighs, and mix them well together with your hands; then put to it as much warm water, mix'd with a little Barme, as you think will make it into very ſtiffe Dough, and as much Salt as is convenient; which being done, knead it well, until it be exactly mingled, which will quickly be, by reaſon of the dryneſs and meali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Roots; afterwards make Loaves of it, and ſee that it be well baked.</p>
               <p>This Bread, if the Corn was good, and if it be rightly made, and well baked, will be as hollow, and as white, as pleaſant in taſte, and as whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome and nutrimental, as if it was all of Wheat;
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:109070:7"/>
for all that have written of <hi>Potatoes,</hi> do agree, that howſoever they be eaten, they do mightily com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, ſtrengthen and nouriſh the Body.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The Roots them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves are not windy therefore not the Bread.</note>But if any ſhall Object; That <hi>this Bread is Windy.</hi> I Anſwer; That it cannot be, for the Roots be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing  firſt boyled, and then mingled with Flower, and afterwards baked, it is impoſſible they ſhould be windy: For by this double Coction they are ſo corrected, that they are made the more wholſome, and all their windineſs taken away: Neither be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus uſed, can you at all, or very little diſcern the taſte of the <hi>Potatoes,</hi> by which it is evident, that the Bread made of them is not windy. And not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly may Bread be made of theſe Roots, but alſo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers other wholeſome Meats, as here followeth.</p>

Take of the Meal of the Roots, as much as you pleaſe; of Wheat Flower, or for want thereof, fine Barley Flower, enough to make it into Dough, without water; put a little Salt to it, and knead it well; then make thin Cakes of it, and bake them in an Oven, or upon the Hearth.

               <p>After the ſame manner may Bread be made, cheaper than the other way before mentioned; for by how much the more of the Root is put into it, by ſo much will it be the cheaper: And uſually to make Bread without water, or any other moiſture, than what is in the Roots, except a little Barme, there is required three parts of the Meal of the Roots, to two parts of Flower. I have ſeen Bread made after

this way, very good, white and hollow, though there was no Barme at all put into it; but I ſhall leave this to every one, to uſe that way, which by his own experience he finds to be beſt.</p>

               <p>And thus I have ſhewed you the ſeveral uſes of <hi>Potatoes;</hi> I ſhall now proceed to ſhew, what great Benefit they may be: Firſt, to the Planters, by planting of them. Secondly, to the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, by the uſe of them.</p>

                  <note place="margin">The Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of <hi>Potatoes</hi> to the Planters.</note>The Benefit which theſe Roots will be to the  Planters, will be very great, as ſhall be proved by the Demonſtration following. Suppoſe a man ſhould plant one Acre of good Ground, which if it be Earable Land, may perhaps be worth eight, nine or ten Shillings a year; or if it be Paſture or Graſs Ground, it may be worth twenty Shillings, or more; we will count, how much more profit may be made of it, by planting it with theſe Roots, than can be made of it, if it lye for Graſs, or be ſowed with Corn, and ſo we ſhall perceive what the Planters Gain will be. And firſt, Every Acre of Ground contains eight-ſcore ſquare Poles or Perches; Now ſuppoſe that one Pole ſhould bear but one Buſhel of Roots, in the Acre there would be eight-ſcore Buſhels of Roots, and every Buſhel (I mean an heaped Buſhel, for ſo ſuch things are alwayes meaſured) will make as much Bread as a Buſhel of Corn: Here is eight-ſcore Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhels of Roots, againſt twenty, thirty or forty Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhels of Corn, which is as much as an Acre can yield: Now if theſe Roots may be ſold for twelve Pence a Buſhel, which they are very well worth, the eight-ſcore Buſhels come to eight Pounds.</p>
               <p>But further, if every Pole of Ground yields three or four Buſhels of Roots, as it will, if the Ground be good, and yet you may leave enow to ſtore the Ground the next year, then is the Gain much the more, for out of the Acre may be digged ſix hundred and forty Buſhels,<note place="margin">An Acre of Ground will yield 640. Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhels of Roots.</note> which (being ſold  for twelve Pence a Buſhel) comes to thirty two Pounds; thus you may ſee what Profit may be made of one Acre planted with theſe Roots. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:109070:10"/>
the Ground being once planted, there is no more charge nor trouble about them, unleſs it be to deſtroy them, which is very hardly done: Neither is there any need of Dunging, (provided the Ground be good at the firſt) for the Stalks being ſpread upon the Ground, when the Roots are dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, and there ſuffered to lye and rot, ſerve inſtead of Dung: whereas for Corn, the Ground muſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very year be dunged, ploughed and ſowed. But if any will beſtow Dung upon his Ground, then he may reſerve the Stalks for Fuel, which, if well dryed, and laid up, will be worth the Dung he layes upon his Plantation; but they muſt be left a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad till after <hi>Christmaſs,</hi> and often turned, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they will be through dry; but being dry, they will be excellent Fuel for brewing, heating of Ovens, or the like uſes.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The Price of them.</note>As for the Price of the Roots, I think none will  grudge to give twelve Pence the Buſhel for them, if they conſider what may be ſaved by them; for if, when Corn is at five Shillings a Buſhel, a man may have as much Bread as two Buſhels of Corn will make for ſix Shillings, he will have little cauſe to think it dear, becauſe it ſaves four Shillings; in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry two Buſhels, beſides a great deal of pains, ſix Shillings being ſooner earned than ten; and alſo, men that have Ground, will be the more encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to plant, when they ſee that there is good gain to be made of them.</p>
               <p>But ſome may ſay; <q>What Profit will be made of them in a plentiful year, for when Corn is cheap, no body will make Bread of them?</q>
               </p>
               <p>To which I Anſwer; That in a time of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:109070:11"/>
plenty, Bread may be made with one half of theſe Roots, and the other half of Wheat or Barley, cheaper than with all Wheat or Barley; beſides, the Bread which is made with Barley, and theſe Roots, is whiter, and far better than Barley Bread, even almoſt as good as that of Wheat; wherefore I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not think, but that they will be uſed, as well in a plentiful year, as in a dear year.</p>
               <p>Thus much of the Benefit theſe Roots will yield to the Planters thereof; we will now treat of the other Utilities and Benefits the uſe of them will bring to the whole Kingdom, ſetting them down every one in particular.</p>

                     </note>THe firſt Utility will be to His Majeſty, who,  of the Planters of theſe Roots, may have a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue of forty or fifty thouſand Pounds <hi>per Annum.</hi> willingly and freely, without any manner of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſion, for that thereby, the Planters gain and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of their Plantations, will be made the more certain. Now this Revenue may be raiſed without any Charge at all to His Majeſty, and without any manner of damage or diſcontent to any Subject whatſoever, after this manner following.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, If it ſhall pleaſe His Majeſty to command, that there be brought out of <hi>Ireland,</hi> ſo many of the ſaid Roots, as that (with thoſe which already are
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:109070:11"/>
to be had in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Wales)</hi> every man which ſhall be Licenſed by His Majeſty to plant of them, may have one Buſhel at leaſt to begin his Plantation with: And if (after the Roots are brought over) ſuch a courſe be taken, as that they may be convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to all the chief Towns throughout <hi>England,</hi> then the Planters may fetch them (four or five joyning together) without much charge; allowing not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding to thoſe that bring them ſufficient gain.</p>
                  <p>Now if every Planter have one Buſhel, he may with that plant about four Poles of Ground, cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting every Peck into four hundred pieces, and plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them as hath been ſhewed before; and by year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly digging them up, and planting more Ground, without diminiſhing of them, (ſtill leaving that which was firſt planted ſufficiently ſtored) with the increaſe of the ſecond year, he may have an Acre and half, or two Acres of Ground planted: So that at the end of two years and an half, he may begin to digg up the Roots to ſell; and at the end of three years, he ſhall have received one years profit, and then all his charge and trouble will be at an end, beſides the yearly digging of them up, which is but little, conſidering the profit he makes by them.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, If His Majeſty will be pleaſed to command, that there be in every Town and Pariſh one or two, according to the bigneſs of the ſeveral Towns and Pariſhes, that ſhall plant, and keep planted with the ſaid Roots, each man an Acre and half, or two Acres of Ground, that they may be ſufficiently ſtored with them: Or (which is a
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:109070:12"/>
more certain way) that there be for every hundred Families one Planter, with all prohibiting all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons whatſoever from planting of them, either to ſell, or for their own private uſe, but only thoſe which have Licenſe and Authority from His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty to plant and ſell them, which perhaps may be about the number of ten thouſand, there being in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Wales</hi> almoſt ten thouſand Pariſhes; and although ſome Pariſhes have not an hundred Families, yet others have two, three or four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Families, therefore it is probable there may be ten thouſand Planters in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Wales;</hi> and queſtionleſs, ſo many Roots may be had in <hi>Ireland.</hi> and <hi>Wales,</hi> and in the North of <hi>England,</hi> as that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Planter may have a Buſhel or more.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, If His Majeſty ſhall be pleaſed to command, the uſe of theſe Roots, by all people, in all parts of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Wales, viz.</hi> by putting one half, or a third part thereof into their Bread, for ſix Months together, every year, from the firſt day of <hi>October,</hi> to the laſt day of <hi>March,</hi> then will the Planters Gain be made certain: For, ſuppoſe that every Planter do ſerve an hundred Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies with Roots, and they tyed to buy of their own Planter, (as it is neceſſary they ſhould) thoſe hundred Families cannot ſpend leſs than an hundred Buſhels in a Month, which comes to five Pounds; and in ſix Months ſix hundred Buſhels, which comes to thirty Pounds; out of which, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Planter may afford to pay to His Majeſty five Pounds <hi>per Annum.</hi> for his Licenſe and Authority to plant and ſell the ſaid Roots; which, of ten thouſand Planters, amounts to fifty thouſand
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:109070:12"/>
Pounds <hi>per Annum.</hi> which may be paid to His Majeſty every year at the latter end of <hi>March,</hi> at what time the Planters will have made the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of their Plantations: The other twenty five Pounds they have for the Rent of their Ground, and for their Labour, which is only for one half year; the other half they may ſpend about their other Employments.</p>
                  <p>But this is not yet all that they will make of their Plantations; for it may be ſuppoſed, that, although the uſe of theſe Roots is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned, but only for ſix Months, yet they will be uſed, both before that time, and alſo after that time is expired; ſo that their gain and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit will be increaſed perhaps ten Pound a year more, beſides what they ſave by them in their own Houſes: And then, if every Planter ſhould ſerve but fifty Families, each Family ſpending but one Buſhel a Month, (although ſome will ſpend more) they would notwithſtanding make twenty Pound a year clear; (counting thoſe which they ſpend themſelves, to ſave them as much in Houſe-keeping, as all the Charge the Digging of them comes to) and therefore, may alſo afford to give five Pound a year for their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe.</p>
                  <p>And if ſome of the nicer ſort of People ſhall not fancy the Bread, wherein there is ſo many of the Roots, they may put only a fourth part of them into their own Bread, and one half, or a third part into their Servants Bread; and if they ſhall uſe them ſome of the other wayes
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:109070:13"/>
afore-mentioned, they may eaſily ſpend every Month one Buſhel and more, though they have but a ſmall Family.</p>

                  <p>Firſt, That there is no Nation ſo barbarous, no People ſo brutiſh, but there is ſomething a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them worthy of imitation.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, I ask, Why theſe Roots ſhould not be made uſe of, by which many thouſands of poor men, in the greateſt times of ſcarcity, may with eaſe maintain their Families, as well as that <hi>Narcotick Indian</hi> Hearb <hi>Tobacco;</hi> which cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupts
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:109070:13"/>
the Breath, dulls the Sences, makes many a good Wit ſottiſh and ſtupid, many a rich man beggerly and poor? I do not deny the Medicinal uſe of it; for it is endued with many excellent Faculties; but this I think, that of all the wayes of uſing it, the common way of taking it in a Pipe is the worſt, although ſome Phyſicians commend it to their Patients, and uſe it them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, (as they pretend) for the Exciccation of Rhumes; I rather judge it to be, that both themſelves, and their Patients, may in the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern or Ale-houſe, (like good Fellows) ſit and drink with the more liberty and freedom, againſt the dangerous Conſequents whereof, this is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted a ſpecial Antidote.</p>
                  <p>But to return to our purpoſe; I ſay, that in the uſe of theſe Roots, we imitate not the <hi>Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans;</hi> for the <hi>Indians</hi> themſelves, the greateſt part of whoſe Diet they have been for many Ages, never knew theſe ſeveral uſes of them; nor have they been uſed after this manner in any Nation, where of late years they have been planted.</p>

                     <note place="margin">Another Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note>And Laſtly, Seeing they may be ſo profitable to all ſorts of people, there is none (I think) but without compulſion will be willing to make uſe of them.</p>
                  <p>Some again will Object, and ſay; <q>If the planting of theſe Roots, and the uſe of them, is ſo beneficial, as you pretend; why ſhould not every man plant of them? Why ſhould the planting of them be prohibited, and only a
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:109070:14"/>
certain number allowed of, and thoſe made to pay a yearly rare for the doing of it?</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">The Anſwer.</note> To this I Reply. Firſt, That if ſome ſuch courſe be not taken, it will be many years, before they will be ſo planted, as that any, eſpecially the Poor, and thoſe that have no Ground of their own, will ever be the better for them: but by this means, in two years and an half, there will be ſuch ſtore of them in all parts of the Kingdom, as that every one may know where to have them for their Money.</p>
                  <p>Seondly, My intention in the Writing and Publiſhing of this Treatiſe, was partly, that thoſe who have little or no Eſtates, nor was ever brought up in any Calling, ſhould, by the planting of theſe Roots, have a way to get a Maintenance for their Families; which cannot be, if every one ſhould plant them.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, There is no Reaſon, why that which is ſo beneficial to the whole Kingdom, ſhould not be made beneficial to the Kings Majeſty alſo, ſeeing it muſt be by His Authority chiefly, that it comes to be of benefit to any. Thus having ſufficiently Anſwered theſe Objections, I ſhall proceed to</p>

For,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, His Majeſties Revenue of Cuſtom will be increaſed, by the often coming in of Ships for Corn, with Foreign Goods and Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize: Alſo a League and Amity will be continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with thoſe People, to whom it is tranſported; ſo that from them, His Majeſty (if need re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire) may have aid and help againſt Foreign Invaſions, or Domeſtique Diſturbances; which, if at any time hereafter they ſhall happen, ſo as not to be ſuppreſſed with mean Force, a Foreign Army may quickly be procured, and here in <hi>England</hi> be eaſily maintained, without raiſing the Prizes of any kind of Grain whatſoever.</p>

But if any ſhall be ſo proud, as to think it below their degree, to make uſe of ſo mean a help, let them forbear the uſe of them, unleſs by publique Authority it be commanded. Many I know there are, who, becauſe they are Gentlemen, will think, that it
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:109070:16"/>
belongs not to them to be ſaving and provident, but rather to be free and generous, (as the Name imports) and to ſpend what they have merily; but let ſuch conſider, that a prodigal Father makes a beggerly Son, and that the Eſtates which they ſo freely ſpend, was left by their Anceſtors, not to them only, but alſo to their Children after them; which for them to waſte in Extravagancy and Riot, and ſo to rob and deprive their own Children of their right, is not only as great a Sin, but alſo a Fact much more unnatural, than to rob a man upon the high way, for which they ought to ſuffer Death by the Laws of the Realm. I have known ſome, who have been ſo guilty of this waſteful and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant kind of Living, that it hath been the utter ruine and deſtruction of themſelves, and their Poſterity. But to come to a Concluſion; Let every Man, that deſires to live in Credit in the World, and that his Children ſhould do ſo after him, remember the Golden Sayings of the Philoſopher, <hi>Adibe curam, tene menſuram, &amp; eris dives,</hi> and not laviſh away his Eſtate like a Prodigal, and when he dyes leave his Children Beggers; but let him uſe all the wayes of Fruga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity that he can, among which, this Experiment, which I have here publiſhed, for the good of my Country, will be none of the leaſt.</p>
                  <p>Thus have I finiſhed what I intended in this Treatiſe, and have to my knowledge omitted nothing, either concerning the Planting, or Uſe of theſe Roots: I have now nothing elſe to
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:109070:17"/>
ſay of them, but what I have partly ſaid already, which is, that they are good and wholeſome, ſtrengthening and nutrimental, not windy in the leaſt, much of the nature and temperature of Wheat, <hi>viz.</hi> having no great inequality of heat, cold, moiſture or dryneſs; yet, if they exceed in any quality, it is in dryneſs, and in that they are the more wholeſome; for <hi>Hypocrates</hi> ſaith, <hi>Siccumest ſano proximum;</hi> and Experience teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that a drying Diet is better for the Body, than that which is too moiſt: For when a <hi>Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitum</hi> muſt periſh, it periſheth by the Element of Water, which overcomming, natural Heat is quenched and extinguiſhed in Animals; hence followeth the deſtruction and mortification of a part, or of the whole Body: But theſe Roots, by their moderate dryneſs, preſerve the true temperature of the Body; which (according to <hi>Hypocrates)</hi> is, <hi>Naturalis ejus ſiccitas,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, may ſafely be uſed, as a wholeſome and healthful Food.</p>
                  <p>Neither are they wholeſome only, but very profitable alſo, and that for two Reſpects.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, For that by the uſe of them, Bread may be made a great deal cheaper, than with all Wheat or Barley.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, For that they are not hurt (as Corn is) by the unſeaſonableneſs of the Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for whether the year be dry or wet, (if the water have free paſſage away, and ſtand not up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them) they are not hurt by it, nor is their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe much the leſs.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="27" facs="tcp:109070:17"/>
And now, leſt any ſhould erre in the making of this Bread, and ſo impute the fault to me, which is cauſed through their own unskilfullneſs, I will here again ſet down the way and manner of making it, as plain as poſſible I can, and ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude this Treatiſe.</p>
                  <p>Take therefere of the Roots, as many as you pleaſe, or as your preſent occaſion requires; and if they be for white Bread, or for Paſte, you may (if you pleaſe) pare them with a Knife; if for courſer Bread, you need not: Then cut the great ones into halves or quarters, that they may be boyled as ſoon as the ſmall ones; afterward put them into a Net, made in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different large and thick, (never putting above a Peck into a Net) and boyl them in a Kettle of Water, till they will break between your Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, but let them not break in the boyling, leſt they be too much ſoaked with water; when they are boyled enough, (which will be in a quarter of an hour, or leſs) take them out, and with an Iron Truel, rub them through a thick Wier Sieve; which being done, you may make Bread of them two wayes.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Take an equal weight of the Roots thus prepared, and of Wheat or Barley Flower, and mingle them well together; then put to it as much warm Water, mix'd with a little Barme, as will make it into very ſtiffe Dough, and with a little Salt, knead it well together.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Take ten Pounds of Wheat or Barley Flower, fifteen Pounds of the Roots,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:109070:18"/>
prepared as aforeſaid; or ſo much as will make the Flower into very ſtiffe Dough, without either Water or Barme; yet, if you perceive that it be not hollow enough, you may adde a little Barme. Of theſe two kinds of Dough may be made thin Loaves, which muſt be baked in an Oven well heated, for it requires ſomething more baking than other Bread.</p>
                  <p>And thus may Bread be made, as well in dear as in plentiful years, at eaſie and cheap Rates, not without great benefit both to Rich and Poor; there being none of ſo dainty a Palate, or ſo finely fed, but may eat this Bread with pleaſure and profit: And although ſome there may be, who will find fault with it; yet the time may come, when thoſe that moſt diſlike it, may be glad to make uſe of it. However, I doubt not, but that this my Experiment, will by poor People, and thoſe of ſmall Eſtates, be well approved of, and alſo in convenient time be made uſe of, to the Glory of God, and the good of themſelves, and their Families.</p>

            <head>AN APPENDIX, TOUCHING The Propagation of theſe <hi>Roots</hi> by the <hi>Seeds.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>AFter I had written this Treatiſe, and fitted it for the Preſs, I found, that theſe Roots might be increaſed by the Seeds or Berries, which till then I knew not; for that the year before I took the Seeds out of the Berries, and ſowed them, and they never ſprang up, and therefore I thought that the Seed came not to ſufficient matu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in our Climate: But to make further trial, this laſt year I ſet divers of the Berries whole, which, contrary to my expectation, came up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the beginning of <hi>June;</hi> and are now half a Foot high <hi>July</hi> the 8.</p>
            <p>If any will plant the Berries, for the more ſpeedy increaſing of their ſtore of Roots, they muſt ſet them in good, rich and hollow Ground, well digged and raked, and divided into long nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:109070:19"/>
Beds, about two Foot wide, with Alleys be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them, that they may be the better weeded; for the Berries being ſet in <hi>March,</hi> will not come up before <hi>June,</hi> and therefore the Ground will be full of Weeds, which will choak the young <hi>Pota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toes,</hi> if they be not diligently weeded.</p>
            <p>As for the time of gathering the Berries, it muſt be about <hi>October,</hi> when they are turned a little white; and when they are gathered, they muſt be laid thin upon a boarded Floor till <hi>March,</hi> and then ſet into the Ground as aforeſaid, and ſo will they ſpring up in <hi>June,</hi> &amp; that year yield Roots, to plant again the next, which may either be digged up, and planted thinner, or elſe left in the Ground, which the year following will be mightily filled with them. This I thought good to adde, by way of <hi>Appendix,</hi> for the better, and more ſpeedy increaſing of theſe Roots.</p>
