            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>M Lord, there can be no other Copie given, but the ſame that was delivered; for your Lordſhip does know in this caſe, any perſon accuſed, as your Lordſhip is, may challenge 35; and therefore there is a Return generally of 3 ſcore, or 4 ſcore, and theſe are returned in caſe of your Lordſhips Challenge. When you have challenged ſo many as you pleaſe, then the 12 men that ſtand after your challenge are to be of the Jury: and therefore this is not like a Pannel made up by the Sheriff, in ordinary Cauſes between Man and Man; there they make a formal Pannel, from which they cannot depart, when that is once returned; but here in Criminal Caſes, becauſe of the Challenge, they return either 60 or 80. And I preſume your Lordſhip was attended with the Names delivered.</p>

My Lord, I remember I read the Statute of 2 <hi>H.</hi> 5. where 'tis poſitive, that no Perſons ſhall be Judged in caſes of life and death but by thoſe that have 40 <hi>s.</hi> a year.</p>

                  </speaker>
                  <p>My Lord, perhaps if we had more conſideration of it we ſhould ſpeak more, but if your Lordſhip pleaſes to hear us what we can ſay; firſt, we take it, with ſubmiſſion, at common Law a Freehold was neceſſary to make a man a Juryman. But that which falls out in this caſe is the Statute of 2 <hi>H.</hi> 5. <hi>c.</hi> 3. which Statute, I ſuppoſe, is here in Court; That Statute ſaies this (if you pleaſe I will quote the ſubſtance of it,) that none ſhall be admitted to paſs upon any Inqueſt upon the Tryal of the Death of a man, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept he have Lands and Tenements of the yearly value of 40 <hi>s.</hi> Now we are here, I think, within the Words of the Statute, and I take it to be no Queſtion at all were we not in a City and County. I think this would be no Queſtion upon any Trial in any Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty at large. The Statute does not make any exception or diſtinguiſhment between Cities and Counties at large, but the Words are general, as I have opened them. My Lord, the Statute does alſo provide in caſes of Freehold, or 40 Marks. Now, my Lord, to prove this Statute extends to <hi>London,</hi> though a City and County, there are other Statutes that have been ſubſequent make it plain that it does ſo extend. But before I ſpeak to them, there is, 1 <hi>Inſt. ſo.</hi> 157. that takes notice of this Statute, and ſpeaks it generally that the Freehold ought to be in the ſame County, nor do I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber to have ſeen any Book that diſtinguiſhes between Counties at large and Cities and Counties. But Statutes that have been made concerning Cities and Counties are a plain declaration that this is meant of Juries both in Cities and Counties. I will mention the Statute 7 <hi>H.</hi> 7. <hi>c.</hi> 5. The ſubſtance of the Statute is this; It takes notice that there were Challenges in <hi>London</hi> for that they had not 40 <hi>s. per Ann.</hi> and that this Challenge was to be made in the Wards, which are the ſame with Hundreds in the Counties, ſo this Statute is made to take away the Challenge of 40 <hi>s.</hi> Freehold. This Statute of 7 <hi>H.</hi> 7. that takes away the Challenge in <hi>London</hi> for not having 40 <hi>s.</hi> is, with ſubmiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, a ſtrong Evidence and Authority that it was before that time a good Challenge, for otherwiſe to what end ſhould they make a Statute to take away the Challenge, unleſs it were before a good cauſe of Challenge. In the next place 4 <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>c.</hi> 3. that extends to Civil Cauſes in <hi>London,</hi> and ſays, That in <hi>London</hi> Jurors ſhall (but provides only for <hi>London</hi> in Civil Cauſes) be admitted in Civil Cauſes, that have Goods to the value of 100 Marks. My Lord, if that firſt Statute, or the Common Law, had not extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to require Freeholds in <hi>London,</hi> then there would have been no need of this Statute that was made to enable men to be Jurors that had Goods to the value of 100 Marks. So that we take it to be good Authority, that by the Common Law Freehold was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired in all Civil Cauſes. Then there is another Statute 23 <hi>H.</hi> 8.13. and that will be a ſtrong evidence to ſhew what the Law is: For the Statute ſays, in Cities and Boroughs, in Trials of Murder and Felony, if a Freeman of the City of <hi>London</hi> is to be tried, the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:35626:4"/>
Freemen ſhall be upon the Jury, though they have not Freehold, and then there is a <hi>Proviſo,</hi> that for Knights and Eſquires that are out of the Burrough, though they are ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rained in the Burrough, that extends not to them, though in caſes of Murder and Felo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. As for this Statute, we take this ſenſe of it, Firſt that it does not extend to Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; for when it only names Murders and Felonies, that makes no alteration as to Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, therefore that ſtands as before: But if there be any alteration, that extends only to Freemen and Burgeſſes that are to be tried, but not to Knights and Eſquires, ſo that if we were in a caſe of Felonie and Murder, I think we are not concerned in this Statute, for we are no Freeman nor Burgeſs, but we are an Eſquire, and therefore ought to be tried by Freeholders: ſo that for the Law we relie upon theſe Statutes, that we have looked upon as ſtrong evidence that there ought to be in the Trial of the Life of a man, eſpecially for Treaſon, Freeholders. Firſt, if it were in Civil Cauſes, if this qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be not in Jurie-men, then an Attaint would lie; the Penaltie in an Attaint is, that their Houſes ſhould be pulled down, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This is provided by the Law, to the intent the Jurie may be careful to go according to their Evidence. 'Tis true, no Attaint does lie in Criminal Cauſes, but if ſo be in Civil Cauſes there be required Freeholders, and an Attaint lies if there be not, 'tis not reaſonable to think but there ſhould be as great regard to the Life of a man, as to his Eſtate. Next, my Lord, I do not know any Law that ſets any kind of qualification but this of Freehold, ſo that be the perſons of what condition or nature ſoever, (ſuppoſing they be not outlawed) yet theſe perſons, if this Law be not in effect, may then ſerve, and be put upon the Life of a man. Theſe are the reaſons, my Lord, for which we apprehend they ought to be Freeholders.</p>

                  <p>My Lord, I would deſire one word of the ſame ſide: We inſiſt in this caſe upon theſe two things; Firſt, we conceive, by the Common Law, every Jurie man ought to have a Free hold, we have good Authority for it, <hi>Cokes firſt Inſtitutes,</hi> but if that were not ſo<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I think the Statute Mr. <hi>Pollexfen</hi> hath firſt mentioned, 2 <hi>H.</hi> 5. <hi>c.</hi> 3. to be expreſs in this point. My Lord the Statute in the Preamble does recite all the miſchiefs, it ſaies great miſchiefs, enſued by <hi>Juries</hi> that were made up of perſons that had not Eſtates ſufficient; in what? as well in the caſe of the Death of a man, as in the caſe of Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold between Party and Party: the Statute reciting this miſchief, does in expreſs words, provide two Remedies for the ſame in theſe caſes: firſt on the Life or Death of a man, the <hi>Jury</hi> or <hi>Inqueſt</hi> to be taken ſhall have 40 <hi>s. per ann.</hi> and ſo between party and party 40 Marks, ſo that this being the Trial of the Death of a man, it is interpreted by <hi>Stam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi> 162. <hi>a.</hi> that is in all caſes where a man is arraigned for his Life, that is within the expreſs words of the Statute. Beſides this Expoſition that hath been put upon the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute, my Lord, it does ſeem that the Judgment of ſeveral Parliaments hath been accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly in ſeveral times and ages. My Lord, to inſtance in one Statute that hath not been mentioned, and that is the 33 of <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>c.</hi> 23. that does give the King Power to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Commiſſions of <hi>Oyer</hi> and <hi>Terminer</hi> for Trials in any County of <hi>England:</hi> and that (ſaies the Statute) in ſuch caſes no Challenge to the Shire or Hundred ſhall be allowed; that is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> you ſhall not challenge the <hi>Jury</hi> in ſuch a caſe, becauſe they have not Free-hold, are not of the County where the Treaſon was committed; but that upon the Trial Challenge for lack of Free-hold of 40 <hi>s.</hi> a year ſhall be allowed, though it alters the manner of <hi>trying</hi> Treaſon by the Common Law; ſo that, my Lord, here is the Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of that very Parliament; that though it took away the uſual method of Trials, yet it ſayes the Priſoners Challenge for want of Free-hold. Now indeed that Statute is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed; but I mention it as to the <hi>Proviſo</hi> that it ſhews the Judgment of that Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at that time: My Lord, thoſe other Statutes that have been made to regulate Cities and Towns Corporate, why were they made? 33 <hi>H</hi> 8. That no Free-hold ſhould be allowed, that ſhews that 2 <hi>H.</hi> 5. did extend to theſe Caſes. But, my Lord, theſe Statutes that ſhew the Judgment of the Parliament, ſufficient to our purpoſe, do not extend to this Caſe; the Statute goes only to Murders and Felonies, but
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:35626:4"/>
not to Treaſons: And we are in the Caſe of a Penal Statute, and concerning the Life and Death of a Man, which ought to be taken ſtrictly, it ouſts the Priſoner of a Benefit; and by parity of Reaſon. If Treaſon be not mentioned, your Lordſhip can't by Equity extend it to it, when it only mentions inferiour Offences, and takes away the benefit in lower Caſes: Like the Caſe of the Biſhop of <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> where the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute ſet down Dean and Chapters, and other Eccleſiaſtical Perſons, it ſhall not extend to Biſhops, becauſe it begins with Perſons of an inferiour Nature: No more ſhall Murder and Felony extend to Treaſon. But further the Statute only concerns Freemen, for there is an expreſs Proviſo ,n the Caſe: for in caſe any Knight, or Eſquire come to be Tried in the Place, he has his Benefit as before. My Lord, we are in this Caſe, as in the Caſe not mentioned in the Statute, we are not a Freeman of <hi>London.</hi> My Lord, there is another thing 7 <hi>H.</hi> 7. <hi>c.</hi> 5. Why there was not only requiſite at the Common Law, that the Jurors had ſufficient Freehold, but it was required it ſhould be in the Hundred; and Freehold in the Wards in the Citie is the ſame with Freehold in the Hundreds in the Country: So that the want of Freehold in the Hundred, was a good cauſe of Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge. So that I think it will hardly be denied, but that a Jurie that paſſes upon the life of a Man, ought by the Law, by the Statute, and by the Judgment of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to have Freehold. Where is there then any Statute whatſoever that makes a difference in this Caſe, between <hi>London</hi> and other Counties; We are in the caſe of Treaſon, we have taken our Exceptions, and on behalf of the Priſoner at the Bar we pray the Challenge may be allowed.</p>

                  <speaker>Mr. Ward.</speaker>
                  <p>My Lord, I ſhall be ſhort, becauſe Mr. <hi>Pollexfen</hi> has obſerved theſe things, ſo particularly already, I obſerve the Statute of <hi>H.</hi> 5. is a general Statute, and extends throughout the Realm: Now when the thing is thus general, there is no room to except particulars. And in this caſe 'tis within the very words of the Law, if the words be ſo generally penned in the negative, then we conceive there is no conſtruction to be made upon them, unleſs ſome ſubſequent Parliament alter it. <hi>Coke</hi>'s <hi>Inſtitutes</hi> 157. where 'tis ſaid in Treaſon as well as any thing elſe, upon <hi>H.</hi> 5. there ſhall be Freeholds. If they have provided in Civil and other Criminal Cauſes, it were ſtrange that this ſhould be <hi>Caſus omiſſius,</hi> but there is no conſtruction againſt a negative Law. For the Parliament taking care of the City of <hi>London</hi> (as the ſubſequent Statutes ſay) that he that hath 100 Marks ſhall paſs in Civil Cauſes, and then it ſays in Murders and Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies, and that only confined to the Freemen of the place, does ſufficiently explain the Law, where 'tis not altered by any ſubſequent Act, therefore I deſire the Challenge may be admitted.</p>

                  <p>My Lord, theſe Gentlemens Foundation is not good, for they prove it not by any Books, that at Common Law it was requiſite for a Juryman to have Freehold. My Lord, I deny their Foundation, there is no ſuch Law, and at this day in all Criminal Caſes where the Statute does not direct it, as for Riots and other In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formations for Miſdemeanour, there is no Law reſtrains them, and they may be tried by any men they have no exception againſt. Then 2 <hi>H.</hi> 5 ſays, None ſhall be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to paſs upon the death of a Man, (I take it to extend to all Capital matters, though it is prettie odly expreſſed; for when a Man is accuſed of Felonies and other High Treaſons, 'tis of the death of a Man) unleſs he have Lands or Tenements, of the yearly value of 40 <hi>s.</hi> But I will take it as theſe Gentlemen do at this Time, it not being ſo at Common-Law, nor in other criminal caſes, but what are provided for by the Statute: as to other matters of Felonie and Murder, no doubt there theſe Challenges are to be taken upon the Statute, but not for Treaſon, becauſe the Statute of Queen <hi>Mary</hi> does expreſly repeat their Statute; and no Statute ſince takes away the force of that of Q. <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>; that all Trials for Treaſon ſhall be as at the Common-Law; and according to this the conſtant practice in all Cities (not only <hi>London</hi>) where Perſons have been Indicted for High Treaſon hath been. There was never any ſuch thing pretended: Moſt of
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:35626:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                     <hi>London</hi>; ſo that the Statute they ſpeak of, and the Interpretations of the ſeveral other theſe Gentlemen have Freeholds, but we would not have this point loſt to the Citie of Statutes too, are to no purpoſe; for we ſay by Common-Law all Cauſes might be tried by any Perſons, againſt whom there was not ſufficient cauſe of Challenge; and the Common-Law is by that Statute reſtored in this point.</p>

It was not neceſſary at Common-Law, for a Jury-man to have Freehold: but then they muſt ſhew you, my Lord, it is altered, and made ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary. The Statute of <hi>H.</hi> 5. does not ſeem to extend to Treaſon, but if it did, 'tis now out of doors, by that of Q <hi>Mary,</hi> whereby all Trials of Treaſon are reduced to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Law.

                  <p>My Lord, I confeſs they have cited ſeveral Acts of Parliament, and upon them laid their Foundation, and drew Inferences from them? But they will find, that in ſeveral Acts of Parliament which they have quoted, there is a particular regard had for the preſervation of the conſtant Uſage and Cuſtom for Trials within the City of <hi>London.</hi> That notwithſtanding ſeveral Acts of Parliament have in other places aſcertained the value of Jurors; yet they had ſtill an Eye that the City of <hi>London</hi> ſhould continue in its Uſages. I think it will be neceſſarie to put you in mind of the Caſe of the City of <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter.</hi> It would be very hard, ſay they, becauſe an Attaint does not lie in Criminal mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; if you intend by that to have People of Abilitie, 'tis well known, that the ableſt People in the Citie of <hi>London,</hi> have ſcarce any Free-hold in it; for that moſt of the Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritances of the Citie of <hi>London</hi> remain in the Nobility and in Corporations. Now in the Caſe of my Lord <hi>Ruſſel,</hi> he hath a peremptory Challenge to 35, and I think I may ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture to ſay, there can ſcarce be 35 more that can call themſelves Free-holders in <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi>; conſider the Conſequence then, Treaſon ſhould be committed in the Citie of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> and there would not be enow in the Citie of <hi>London</hi> to trie it. In the Caſe of the <hi>Quo-Warranto</hi> brought againſt the Citie of <hi>Worceſter,</hi> to know by what Warrant ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral took upon them the Offices of Aldermen; the Gentlemen at the Bar objected that it was reaſonable that no Freehold ſhould be determined, but by Free-holders. But the Judges of the <hi>Kings-Bench</hi> (the Court being full) for the neceſſity of the thing, leſt there might not be ſufficient Freeholders in the Citie, having ſent one of the Judges of that Court to your Lordſhips of the <hi>Common-Pleas,</hi> for that Reaſon did agree the Challenge was not good. I know theſe Gentlemen will pleaſe to remember the Caſe; ſo that I ſay, as in one Caſe we ought to be tender of the life of the Priſoner, ſo we ought ſurely to be tender of the life of the King, otherwiſe it may ſo happen, that the Kings life may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compaſſed, and Treaſon committed in the Citie, and there would be no way in the World to try it; therefore we pray for the King the Challenge may be over-ruled.</p>

                  <p>My Lord, it is the practice to make the <hi>Venire facias,</hi> without mentioning Freehold, for it does not Command, that they return ſo many men that have Freehold, but <hi>probos &amp; legales homines de viſeneto</hi>; therefore at the Common-Law, thoſe were good Inqueſts to trie any man that were not Excommunicated, nor under any Out-Law. 'Tis true, there are Statutes that ſay, all Jury-men ſhall have Freehold; but we ſay theſe Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes do not extend to the Citie of <hi>London,</hi> but that it is governed by its own Cuſtoms; and we ſay it is the Cuſtom that Citizens of Ability have been returned, that have no Freehold. But granting what we do not, but by way of ſuppoſal, my Lord, it does not extend to this Caſe, becauſe Trials are to be according to the uſe at Common-Law, by the Statute of Q. <hi>Mary,</hi> which does ſet them at large again; and that is the reaſon the Priſoner, in this Caſe, hath his Challenge for 35, and is in other Caſes reſtrained to 20; ſo that we ſay theſe men of Ability are good, and there is no Statute affects them.</p>

                  <p>Unleſs you ſpeak of Treaſon, you do not ſpeak <hi>ad idem.</hi> For I do take it that in Caſes of Treaſon, or in Caſes of Felony, at the Comon Law, they had no liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to except to Jurors, that they had not any Freehold, but that at the Common-Law any good and lawful men might paſs. Then take, as introductive of a new Law, the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of <hi>H.</hi> 5. I am of the mind that this Statute of <hi>H.</hi> 5. peradventure may extend to Treaſons and Felonies; but when the Statute of Q. <hi>Mary</hi> comes and ſays, all Trials ſhall be by ſuch Evidence, and in ſuch manner, as by Common Law they ought to have been, I do not ſee how it is poſſible to make an Objection afterwards of this nature. For, admitting this Act of Parliament of <hi>H.</hi> 5. had altered the Common Law, and given a Challenge, why then when the Statute of Q. <hi>Mary</hi> comes and ſets all Trials at large in the Caſe of Treaſons, then certainly the Challenge is gone again, and I doubt you will not find one Exception in this Caſe, ever ſince that Statute concerning the Juries Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold in Caſes of Treaſon, but it hath generally paſſed otherwiſe, and there hath not been any ever excepted; I doubt it will be a very hard thing to maintain ſuch a Challenge now. Here are my Lords and Brothers will be pleaſed to deliver their Opinions. It is a buſineſs of great conſequence, not only for this Noble Perſon at the Bar, but for all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Perſons.</p>

                  <p>I agree with your Lordſhip perfectly, but if the Counſel had laid a right Foundation that it had been ſo at Common Law, there had been much ſaid; But I take it at Common Law there was no Challenge for want of Freehold, and I am induced to think ſo, for otherwiſe what needed the Statute of <hi>H.</hi> 5. been made? But whether it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to Treaſon or no, I am not ſo clear. And if it did, it's wiped off again by that of Q <hi>Mary,</hi> which reduces all to the Common Law Trial.</p>

                  <p>I am of the ſame Opinion: I conceive at Common Law, lack of Freehold no good cauſe of Challenge. 'Tis true, that Challenge is given in ſome Caſes by Act of Parliament, yet I doubt whether it extend to a thing of ſo high nature as Treaſon, for other Statutes have not mentioned any thing of Treaſon. But ſuppoſe 2 <hi>H.</hi> 5. did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to it, yet it is very plain, the Statute of 1. &amp; 2. Q. <hi>Mary</hi> hath ſet all at large again. They are to be good and lawful men, and I do not find that any thing of the lawfulneſs muſt be the Freehold. And therefore, I conceive this is no juſt Exception in this Caſe.</p>

                  <p>My Lord, I am of the ſame Opinion: I am of Opinion that the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Law did not require Freehold to be a good cauſe of Challenge in the Caſe of Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and the rather, Becauſe at the Common Law a man that was Indicted of High Treaſon, had liberty to Challenge, peremptorily, to the number of 35 Perſons. My Lord, if the Common Law be altered by the Stat. of <hi>H.</hi> 5. yet I take it, that the Statute of 1 &amp; 2 <hi>Ph.</hi> &amp; <hi>M.</hi> does reſtore the Common Law in this particular point. For whereas there was a Stat. of <hi>H.</hi> 8. to reſtrain the Priſoner to the number of 20, for his Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge, now the Statute reſtoring it to Common Law, the Priſoner has his Challenge to 35, as he had before that Stat. of <hi>H.</hi> 8. So I take it, the King ſhall have his priviledge alſo to try a Priſoner for Treaſon, by Perſons that have not Freehold.</p>

                  <p>I am of Opinion 'tis not to be allowed. I do not think my ſelf driven to the neceſſity to determin now whether Freehold was a good Challenge at Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Law in point of Treaſon. I think the Statute of <hi>Ph.</hi> and <hi>M.</hi> hath reſtored the Trials to the Common Law. What was the Common Law? The Common Law is the Cuſtom of <hi>England,</hi> which is other in Cities than in Countries, and the Cuſtom of <hi>London</hi> is part of that Common Law, So, though it be a cauſe of Challenge in a County at large, yet it is not a cauſe of Challenge in Cities, where Freeholders are not to be found.
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:35626:6"/>
Now that which ſatisfies me is, That this Cuſtom is reſtored by the Statute of <hi>Ph.</hi> and <hi>M.</hi> Becauſe never ſuch a Challenge hath been. And it is known when 20 were tried for Treaſon together in this very place, and one of them a notable cunning Lawyer, and if ſuch a Challenge were to have been allowed, no doubt, he would have made uſe of it, but the Challenge was not taken, and if he had made ſuch a Challenge, and it had been allowed, perhaps he could not have been tried: That was <hi>Cook.</hi> I have heard ſeveral perſons tried for Treaſon my ſelf, and never heard it taken. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I am of Opinion, that before any Statute was made in this caſe, it was the Cuſtom in <hi>London</hi> to try without Freeholds, and ſince by the Statute of Q. <hi>Mary</hi> it is reſtored.</p>

                  <speaker>Mr. Baron Streete.</speaker>
                  <p>I think there was no ſuch Challenge at Common Law. The Jury were only to be <hi>probos &amp; legales homines,</hi> and no more, till the Statute made it ſo, but there is a particular Reſervation for Corporations. And certainly, if this ſhould be admitted to be a good Challenge, though it were between party and party, there would be in ſome Corporations a perfect failure of Juſtice. So that without doubt at Common Law there was no ſuch Challenge. As for the Statute of <hi>H.</hi> 5. 'tis gone by that of Q <hi>Mary.</hi> If this were admitted within <hi>London,</hi> nothing would be more miſchie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous to this Corporation. Methinks we have been very nice in this matter, when the Life of the King is at ſtake, and all the Cuſtoms and Priviledges of the City of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> ſeem to be levelled at in this point. I am of the Opinion with the reſt of the Judges, that this, Challenge ought to be over-ruled.</p>

                  <p>My Lord, the Court is of Opinion, upon hearing your Counſel, and the Kings, that it is no good Challenge to a Jurie in a caſe of Treaſon, that he has not Freehold within the City. But I muſt tell your Lordſhip withal, That your Lordſhip has nothing of hardſhip in this caſe, for notwithſtanding that, I muſt tell you, you will have as good a Jurie, and better than you ſhould have had in a Country of 4 <hi>l.</hi> or 40 <hi>s.</hi> a Year Freeholders. The Reaſon of the Law for Freeholds is, That no ſlight perſons ſhould be put upon a Jury, where the Life of a man or his Eſtate comes in Queſtion, but in the City the perſons that are impanell'd are men of Quality and Subſtance, men that have a great deal to loſe: and therefore Your Lordſhip hath the ſame in ſubſtance, as if a Challenge was allowed of Freehold. It will be no kind of prejudice to your Lordſhip in this caſe; Therefore, if you pleaſe, apply your ſelf as the Jury is called, and make your Exceptions, if you ſhall make any.</p>

                  <p>My Lord, and you Gentlemen of the Jurie, moſt of our Evidence againſt this honorable Perſon at the Bar is to this purpoſe, This Perſon, the Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> my Lord <hi>Grey,</hi> Sir <hi>Thomas Armſtrong,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Ferguſon,</hi> they were the Council of State, as I may call them, to give forth directions for the general Riſing that hath appeared was to have been within this Kingdom. The Riſing was of great concern and expence, and muſt be managed by perſons of intereſt, prudence and great ſecreſie. Theſe Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen had frequent meetings in <hi>October</hi> and <hi>November</hi> laſt, (for then, you may refreſh your memories again, was the general Riſing to be) and there they did conſult how to manage the Riſing; they conſulted how to ſeiſe the Kings Guards; and this Noble per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon being mixed with theſe others, eſpecially with <hi>Ferguſon,</hi> who with others of an infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior rank was alſo ingaged in a Cabal for managing worſer things (though this is bad enough); at ſeveral meetings they receive Meſſages from my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> touching the Riſing. They being looked upon as the perſons that were to conclude and ſettle the time and all circumſtances about it.</p>
                  <p>We ſhall make it appear to you in the courſe of our Evidence, that thoſe Underlings (for this was the great Conſult, and moved all the other Wheels) who managed the Aſſaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſination, did take notice that theſe Lords &amp; Gentlemen of Quality were to manage and ſteer the whole buſineſs of the Riſing. It ſeems theſe Gentlemen could not give the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> ſatisfaction to his mind, for he preſſed them to keep their day, which was the 17. of <hi>November</hi> laſt, But the honourable Perſon at the Bar, and the reſt, made him this Anſwer, That Mr. <hi>Trenchard</hi> had failed them, for that he had promiſed to have 1000 Foot and 2 or 300 Horſe at 4 hours warning, but now it was come to paſs, he could not perform it, that ſome Perſons in the Weſt would not join with them, and therefore at this time they could not proceed, and therefore they muſt defer the day. And as a Council, they ſent my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> word he muſt be contented, they had otherwiſe reſolved, and thereupon my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> went away, and Mr. <hi>Ferguſon</hi> with him.</p>
                  <p>To carrie on this practice they took others into their Council, Sir <hi>Tho. Armſtrong</hi> was leſt out, and there falling that Scandalous Report upon my Lord <hi>Grey</hi> he was to be left out, and then there was to be a new Council of Six, whereas the inferior Council to manage the Aſſaſſination was Seven. At this Council there was this honourable Perſon at the Bar, the Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> my Lord <hi>Howard,</hi> and another honourable Perſon, who I am ſorry to name upon this account, who hath this morning prevented the hand of Juſtice upon himſelf, my Lord of <hi>Eſsex,</hi> and Coll. <hi>Sidney,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Hambden</hi>: Theſe Six had their frequent Conſults at this honourable Perſons houſe; for they had exclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Sir <hi>Tho. Armſtrong,</hi> and my Lord <hi>Gray,</hi> for theſe Gentlemen would have the Face of Religion; and my Lord <hi>Gray</hi> was in their eſteem ſo ſcandalous, that they thought that would nor prevail with the people, if he was of the Council. There they debated how they ſhould make this Riſing, after ſeveral Conſultations they came to this Reſolution, That before they did fall upon this Riſing, they ſhould have an exact accompt both of the time and method of the <hi>Scotch</hi> Riſing; and thereupon a Meſſenger was ſent on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe by Coll. <hi>Sidney,</hi> viz. <hi>Aaron Smith,</hi> to invite <hi>Scotch</hi> Commiſſioners to treat with theſe Noble Lords. Purſuant to this, juſt before the Plot brake out, ſeveral from <hi>Scotland</hi> came to treat with them how to manage the work; 30000 <hi>l.</hi> was demanded by the <hi>Scots,</hi> in order that they ſhould be ready in <hi>Scotland</hi>; then they fell to 10000, and at laſt (for the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:35626:7"/>
                     <hi>Scots</hi> love Mony,) they fell to 5000, which they would take and run all hazards, but they not coming to their terms, that broke off that week the Plot was diſcovered.</p>
                  <p>Gentlemen, if we prove all theſe Inſtances, beſides we ſhall call ſome to ſhew you that all the inferior Party ſtill looked upon theſe to be the Heads; and tho' they kept it ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret, God hath ſuffered it to come to light with as plain an Evidence as ever was heard.</p>

                  <p>I went to them from my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury:</hi> And I did tell them, That my Lord did pray they would come to ſome Reſolution; and they told me, Mr. <hi>Tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard,</hi> who they depended upon for <hi>Taunton,</hi> had failed them, who, when he came up to Town firſt at the Term, had aſſured them, that in three or four Hours time he could have <hi>One Thouſand</hi> Foot, and <hi>Three Hundred</hi> Horſe: but now it came to be tried, he anſwered, it was not poſſible for him to undertake it; for the People would not ruſh into it of a ſudden, but have ſome time to prepare for their Familes.</p>

                  <p>I have very few Queſtions to ask him, for I know little of the matter, for it was the greateſt accident in the world I was there, and when I ſaw that Company was there, I would have been gone again.

                  <p>My Lord, I appear with ſome confuſion. Let no man wonder that it is troubleſome to me. My Lord, as to the Queſtion Mr. <hi>Attorney</hi> puts to me, this is the Accompt I have to give. 'Tis very well known to every one, how great a ferment was made in the City, upon occaſion of the long Diſpute about the Election of Sheriffs: And this ſoon produced a greater freedom and liberty of Speech one with another, than perhaps had been uſed formerly, though not without ſome previous preparations and diſpoſitions made to the ſame thing. Upon this occaſion, among others, I was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with Captain <hi>Walcot,</hi> a perſon that had been ſome Months in <hi>England,</hi> being returned out of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and who indeed I had not ſeen for 11 Years before. But he came to me as ſoon as he came out of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and when theſe unhappy diviſions came, he made very frequent applications to me; and tho' he was unknown himſelf, yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing brought by me he ſoon gained a confidence with my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> and from him derived it to others, when this unhappy rent and diviſion of mind was, he having before got himſelf acquainted with many Perſons of the City, had entred into ſuch Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels with them, as afterwards had the Effect, which in the enſuing Narrative I ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late to your Lordſhip. He came to me, and told me that they were now ſenſible all they had was going, that this Force put upon them—</p>

                  <p>There is an unhappy accident happened, that hath ſunk my voice, I was but juſt now acquainted with the Fate of my Lord of Eſſex—My Lord I ſay, he came to me, and did acquaint me that the People were now ſo ſenſible, that all their Intereſt was going by that violence offered to the City in their Elections, that they were reſolved to take ſome courſe to put a ſtop to it, if it were poſſible. He told me there were ſeveral Conſults and Meetings of perſons about it, and ſeveral perſons
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:35626:9"/>
had begun to put themſelves into a diſpoſition, and preparation to act; That ſome had furniſhed themſelves with very good Horſes, and kept them in the moſt ſecret and blind Stables they could; That divers had intended it, and, for his own part, he was reſolved to imbark himſelf in it. And having an Eſtate in <hi>Ireland,</hi> he thought to diſpatch his Son thither; (for he had a good real Eſtate, and a great Stock, how he diſpoſed of his Real Eſtate I know not); But he ordered his Son to turn his Stock into Mony to furniſh him for the occaſion: This I take to be about <hi>Auguſt.</hi> His Son was ſent away. Soon after this, the Son not being yet returned, and I hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſeveral Accompts from him, wherein I found the Fermentation grew higher and higher, and every day a nearer approach to Action. I told him I had a neceſſity to go into <hi>Eſsex</hi> to attend the concerns of my own eſtate, but told him, how he might by another name convey Letters to me, and gave him a little Cant, by which he might blind and diſguiſe the matter he wrote about, when I was in the Country. I receiv'd two or three Letters from him, that gave me an Account in that diſguiſed ſtile, but ſuch as I underſtood, that the Negotiation which he had with my Correſpondents was going on, and in good Condition; and it was earneſtly deſired, I would come to Town; this was the middle of <hi>September.</hi> I notwithſtanding was willing to ſee the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult of that great Affair, upon which all Mens Eyes were fixed, which was the Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of the Sherivalty about that time. So I ordered it to fall into Town, and went to my own Houſe on <hi>Saturday</hi> night, which was <hi>Michaelmas</hi> day. On <hi>Sunday</hi> he came to me, and Dined with me, and told me (after a general Account given me of the Affairs of the times) that my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> was ſecretted and withdrawn from his own Houſe in <hi>Alderſgate ſtreet</hi>; and that though he had a Family ſetled, and had abſconded himſelf from them, and divers others of his Friends and Confidents; yet he did deſire to ſpeak with me, and for that purpoſe ſent him to ſhew me the way to his Lodging: He brought me to a Houſe at the lower end of <hi>Wood ſtreet,</hi> one <hi>Watſon</hi>'s Houſe, and there my Lord was alone. He told me he could not but be ſenſible, how Innocent ſoever he was, both he and all honeſt men were unſafe, ſo long as the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of Juſtice was in ſuch hands as would accomodate all things to the humor of the Court. That in the ſenſe of this he thought it but reaſonable to provide for his own ſafety, by withdrawing himſelf from his own Houſe into that Retirement, That now he had ripened Affairs to that head, and had things in that preparation, that he did not doubt but he ſhould be able, by thoſe men that vvould be in a readineſs in <hi>London,</hi> to turn the Tide, and put a ſtop to the Torrent that vvas ready to overflovv. But he did complain to me, that his deſign, and the deſign of the Publick vvas very much obſtructed, by the unhandſom deportment of the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> and my Lord <hi>Ruſſel,</hi> vvho had vvithdravvn themſelves, not only from his Aſſiſtance, but from their ovvn Ingagements and appointments. For vvhen he had got ſuch a formed Force as he had in <hi>London,</hi> and expected to have it anſvvered by them in the Country, they did recede from it, and told him they were not in a condition or preparation in the Country, to be concurrent with him at that time. This he looked upon but as an artificial Excuſe, and as an inſtance of their Intentions, wholly to deſert him; but notwithſtanding there was ſuch Preparation made in <hi>London,</hi> that if they were willing to loſe the Honour of being concurrent with him, he was able to do it himſelf, and did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend ſpeedily to put it into Execution. I asked him, what Forces he had, he ſaid he had enough; ſays I, what are you aſſured of? Says he, there is above <hi>Ten Thouſand</hi> brisk Boys are ready to follow me, when ever I hold up my Finger: Says I, how have you methoded this, that they ſhall not be craſhed, for there will be a great Force to oppoſe you? Yes, he anſwered, but they would poſſeſs themſelves of the Gates; and theſe <hi>Ten Thouſand</hi> Men in twenty four Hours, would be multiplied into five times the Number, and be able to make a Sally out, and poſſeſs themſelves of <hi>White-Hall,</hi> by beating the Guards. I told him, this was a fair Story, and I had reaſon to think, a man of his figure would not undertake a thing that might prove ſo fatal, unleſs it were laid
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:35626:10"/>
on a Foundation that might give a prudent man ground to hope it would be ſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. He ſaid he was certain of it, but confeſſed it was a great diſappointment, that theſe Lords had failed him: I told him, I was not provided with an Anſwer at that time, that he well knew me, and knew the general frame, and bent of my Spirit. But I told him, I looked upon it as dangerous, and ought to be laid deep, and to be very well weighed and conſidered of; and did not think it a thing fit to be entered upon, without the Concurrence of thoſe Lords: And therefore deſired, before I diſcovered my own Inclination, to diſcourſe with thoſe Lords. He did conſent, with much ado; but ſays he, you will find they will wave it, and give doubtful and deferring Anſwers, but you will find this a Truth. I went to <hi>Moor Park</hi> the next day, where the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> was, and told him the great Complaint my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> had made, that he failed him: Says he, I think he is Mad, I was ſo far from giving him any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement, that I did tell him from the begining, and ſo did my Lord <hi>Ruſſel,</hi> there was nothing to be done by us in the Country at that time. I did not then own I had ſeen my Lord, but ſpake as if this were brought me by a third Perſon, becauſe he had not given me liberty to tell them where his Lodging was. Says I, My Lord, I ſhall be able to give a better account of this in a day or two; Shall I convey it to my Lord, that you are willing to give a Meeting? Yes, ſays he, with all my heart: This was <hi>October</hi> 2, 3, or 4; I came to Town on <hi>Saturday</hi> and was carried to him on <hi>Munday</hi>; and I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe this was <hi>October</hi> 2. On <hi>Wedneſday</hi> I think I went to him again (but 'tis not very ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial) and told him I had been with the Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> and given him a punctual Account of what I had from him; and the Duke did abſolutely diſown any ſuch thing; and told me, he never did give him any encouragement to proceed that way, becauſe the Countries were not in a diſpſiotion for Action, nor could be put in readineſs at that time; Says my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> 'Tis falſe, they are afraid to own it. And ſays he, I have reaſon to believe, there is ſome artificial Bargain between his Father and him, to Save one another: For when I have brought him to Action, I could never get him to put on, and therefore I ſuſpect him: And ſays he, ſeveral honeſt Men in the City have puzled me, in asking how the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> lived: Says he, they puzled me and I could not anſwer the Queſtion; for I know he muſt have his Living from the King; and, ſays he, We have different Proſpects; We are for a <hi>Common Wealth,</hi> and He hath no other Deſign but his own perſonal Intereſt, and that will not go down with my Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple now, <stage>ſo he called them</stage> they are all for a <hi>Common Wealth</hi>: And then ſays he, 'Tis to no purpoſe for me to ſee him; it will but widen the Breach, and I dare not truſt him to come hither. Says I, my Lord, That's a good one indeed, Dare not you truſt him, and yet do you ſend me to him on this Errand? Nay, ſays he, 'Tis becauſe we have had ſome miſunderſtanding of late; but I believe he is true enough to the Intereſt. Says I, 'Tis a great unhappineſs to take this time to Fall out; and I think 'tis ſo great a Deſign, that it ought to be undertaken with the greateſt Strength and Coalition in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. Says he, my Friends are now gone ſo far, that they can't pull their Foot back a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain without going further; for ſays he, it hath been communicated to ſo many, that 'tis impoſſible to keep it from taking Air, and it muſt go on. Says he, We are not ſo unprovided as you think for; there are ſo many Men, that you will find as brisk Men as any in <hi>England.</hi> Beſides, we are to have 1000. or 1500. Horſe, that are to be drawn by inſenſible Parties into Town, that when the Inſurrection is, ſhall be able to Scour the Streets, and hinder them from forming their Forces againſt us. My Lord, after great enlargement on this Head, and Heads of the like nature, <hi>I</hi> told him <hi>I</hi> would not leave him thus, and that nothing ſhould ſatisfy me, but an Interview between him and the Lords: No, <hi>I</hi> could not obtain it: But if <hi>I</hi> would go and tell them what a Forward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs he was in, and that, if they would do themſelves Right, by putting themſelves upon correſpondent Action in their reſpective Places, and where their Intereſt lay, well, otherwiſe he would go away without them, ſo <hi>I</hi> went again to the Duke of
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:35626:10"/>
                     <hi>Monmouth,</hi> I ſpake to him only, (I never ſpake to my Lord <hi>Ruſſel</hi> then, only we were together, but I had never come to any cloſe conjunction of Counſels in my life with him at that time.) Says I to the Duke, This man is mad, and his Madneſs will prove fatal to us all; he hath been in a Fright by being in the <hi>Tower,</hi> and carries thoſe Fears about him, that cloud his Underſtanding: I think his Judgment hath deſerted him, when he goes about with thoſe ſtrange ſanguine Hopes, that I can't ſee what ſhould ſupport him in the ground of them. Therefore, ſays I<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Pray will you give him a Meeting. <hi>God-ſoe,</hi> ſays the Duke, with all my heart, and I deſire nothing more. Now<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I told him, I had been with my L. <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> with other inlargements, that I need not trouble your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with; Well, ſays he, pray go to him, and try if it be poſſible to get a Meeting: So I went to him, and told him. Says I, This is a great unhappineſs, and it ſeems to be a great abſurdity, that you are ſo forward to act alone in ſuch a thing as this. Pray, ſays I, without any more to do, ſince you have this confidence to ſend for me, let me prevail with you to meet them, and give them an interview, or elſe you and I muſt break. I will no longer hold Correſpondence, unleſs it be ſo. Says he, I tell you they will betray me. In ſhort, he did with much importunity yield, That he would come out the next Night in a Diſguiſe. By this time it was <hi>Saturday,</hi> I take it to be the 6<hi>th</hi> of <hi>October</hi>; an <hi>Almanack</hi> will ſettle that: So the next Night being <hi>Sunday,</hi> and the Shops ſhut, he would come out in a concealment, be carried in a Coach, and brought to his own Houſe, which he thought then was ſafeſt. I came and gave the D. of <hi>Monmouth</hi> an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of it; the Duke, I ſuppoſe, conveyed the ſame Underſtanding to my L. <hi>Ruſſel</hi>; and I ſuppoſe both would have been there accordingly, to have given the Meeting; but next Morning I found Col. <hi>Romſey</hi> had left a Note at my Houſe, that the Meeting could not be that day. Then I went to the Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> and he had had the Account before, That my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> did apprehend himſelf to be in ſome Danger in that Houſe, and that that Apprehenſion had occaſioned him to remove; but we ſhould be ſure to hear from him in two or three days. We took it as a Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and thought he did from thence intend to abſcond himſelf from us, and it prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſo to me, for from that time I never ſaw him. But Captain <hi>Walcot</hi> came to me and told me, that he was vvithdravvn, but it vvas for fear his Lodging might be diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, but he did not doubt, but in a Week he vvould let me knovv vvhere his lodging was. But told me vvithin ſuch a time, vvhich I think vvas 8 or 10 days, there vvould be a Riſing: and I told the D. of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> and I believe he told my L. <hi>Ruſſel</hi>; And vve believed his Frenzy vvas novv grovvn to that heighth, that he would riſe immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately, and put his deſign in execution: ſo we endeavoured to prevent it. Upon which my Lord <hi>Ruſſel</hi> (I was told) and the Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> did force their vvay to my Lord <hi>Shaftsburies,</hi> and did perſuade him to put off the day of his Rendezvouz. I had not this from my L. <hi>Ruſſel,</hi> for I had not ſpoke a Word to him; But the Duke told me, my L. <hi>Ruſſel</hi> had been vvith him, (I had indeed an intimation that he had been vvith him); but the Duke told me, ſays he, I have not been vvith him, but my L. <hi>Ruſſel</hi> was, having been convey'd by Col. <hi>Romſey.</hi> After this day was put off, it ſeems it vvas put off vvith this condition, That thoſe Lords, and divers others, ſhould be in a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs to raiſe the Country about that day fortnight, or thereabouts; for there vvas not above a fortnights time given: And, ſays the Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> vve have put it off, but now we muſt be in Action, for there's no holding it off any longer. And, ſays he, I have been at <hi>Wapping</hi> all night, and I never ſavv a Company of Bolder and Brisker Fellows in my life; And, ſays he, I have been round the <hi>Tower,</hi> and ſeen the Avenues of it; and I do not think it will be hard, in a little time, to poſſeſs our ſelves of it; But ſays he, they are in the wrong way; yet we are ingaged to be ready for them in a Fortnight, and therefore, ſays he, novv vve muſt apply our ſelves to it, as vvell as vve can. And thereupon I believe they did ſend into the Country; and the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> told me, he ſpake to Mr. <hi>Trenchard,</hi> vvho was to take particular care of
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:35626:11"/>
                     <hi>Sommerſetſhire,</hi> vvith this circumſtance, ſays he, I thought Mr. <hi>Trenchard</hi> had been a brisker Fellovv; for when I told him of it, he looked ſo pale, I thought he would have ſvvooned, vvhen I brought him to the brink of Action; and ſaid, I pray go and do vvhat you can among your acquaintance: And truly I thought it would have come then to Action. But I vvent the next day to him, and he ſaid it was impoſſible; they could not get the Gentlemen of the Country to ſtir yet.</p>

                  <p>This is juſt in the order it was done. When this was put off, then they were in a great hurry; and Capt. <hi>Walcot</hi> had been ſeveral times with me, and diſcourſed of it. But upon this diſappointment they ſaid, it ſhould be the diſhonor of the Lords, that they were backward to perform their parts; but ſtill they were reſolved to go on. And this had carried it to the latter end of <hi>October.</hi> About the 17th. or 18th. Captian <hi>Walcot</hi> came to me, and told me, now they were reſolv'd poſitively to riſe, and did believe that a ſmart Party might perhaps meet with ſome Great Men. Thereupon I told the Duke of it; I met him in the ſtreet, and went out of my Coach into his, and told him, That there was ſome dark intimation, as if there might be ſome Attempt upon the Kings Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; with that he ſtrook his breaſt with a great Emotion of ſpirit, and ſaid, Godſoe, Kill the KING! I will never ſuffer that. Then we went to the <hi>Play-Houſe</hi> to find Sir <hi>Thomas Armſtrong,</hi> and ſend him up and down the City to put it off, as they did formerly; and it was done with that ſucceſs, that we were all quieted in our minds, that at that time nothing would be done. But upon the day the King came from <hi>New Market,</hi> we din'd together; the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> was one, and there we had a notion conveyed among us, that ſome bold Action ſhould be done that day; which comparing it with the Kings coming, we concluded it was deſign'd upon the King. And I remember my L. <hi>Gray,</hi> ſaies he, By God, If they do attempt any ſuch thing, it can't fail. We were in great anxiety of mind, till we heard the Kings Coach was come in, and Sir <hi>Thomas Armſtrong</hi> not being there, we apprehended that he was to be one of the Party (for he was not there). This ſailing, it was then next determined (which was the laſt Alarm and News I had of it) to be done upon the 17<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>November,</hi> the Anniverſary of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>; and I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member it by this Remark I made my ſelf, That I fear'd it had been diſcovered, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I ſaw a Proclamation a little before, forbidding publick Bonfires without leave of my Lord <hi>Mayor.</hi> It made ſome impreſſions upon me, that I thought they had got an intimation of our Intention, and had therefore forbid that Meeting. This there<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore of the 17<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>November</hi> being alſo diſappointed, and my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> being told things were not ripe in the Country, took Shipping and got away; and from that time, I heard no more of him, till I heard he was dead. Now, Sir, after this, we all began to lie under the ſame ſenſe and apprehenſions that my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> did, That we had gone ſo far, and communicated it to ſo many, that it was unſafe to make a Retreat; and this being conſidered, it was alſo conſidered, that ſo great an Affair as that was, conſiſting of ſuch infinite particulars, to be managed with ſo much ſine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and to have ſo many parts, it would be neceſſary, that there ſhould be ſome General Council, that ſhould take upon them the care of the Whole. Upon theſe Thoughts, we reſolved to erect a little <hi>Cabal</hi> among our ſelves, which did conſiſt of ſix perſons; and the perſons were, the Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> my Lord of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> my Lord <hi>Ruſſel,</hi> Mr. <hi>Hambden</hi> Jun. <hi>Algernon Sidney,</hi> and my Self.</p>

When we met there, it was preſently agreed, what their proper Province was, which was to have a care of the Whole: And therefore it was neceſſary ſome General things ſhould fall under our Care and Conduct, which could not poſſibly be Conducted by individual Perſons. The things that did Principally Challenge this Care, we thought were theſe; Whether the Inſurrection was moſt proper to be begun in <hi>London</hi> or in the Country, or both at one inſtant. This ſtood upon ſeveral different Reaſons: It was ſaid in the Country; and I remember the D. of <hi>Monmouth</hi> inſiſted upon it, that it was impoſſible to oppoſe a For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, well Methodiz'd, and Govern'd Force, with a Rabble haſtily got together; and therefore whatever Numbers could be gathered in the City, would be ſuppreſſed quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly before they could Form themſelves: Therefore it would be better to begin it at ſuch a diſtance from the Town, where they might have an Opportunity of Forming them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and would not be ſubject to the like panick Fear, as in the Town, where half an hour would convey the News to thoſe Forces, that in another half hour would be ready to ſuppreſs them.</p>

                  <p>In this manner that I tell you, Why it was neceſſary to be done at ſome reaſonable diſtance from the Town. And from thence it was likewiſe conſidered, that the being ſo remote from the Town, it would put the King upon this <hi>Dilemma,</hi> That either the King would ſend His Forces to ſubdue them, or not; if He did, He muſt leave the City Naked, who being <hi>Proximi Diſpoſitioni</hi> to Action, it would give them Occaſion to Riſe, and come upon the back of the Kings Forces; if he did not ſend, it would give them time to Form their Number, and be better Ordered.</p>

                  <p>The other was, What Countries and Towns were the fitteſt and moſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſed to Action: and the <hi>Third.</hi> What Arms were neceſſary to be got, and how to be diſpoſed; and a <hi>Fourth,</hi> (which ſhould have been indeed firſt in Conſideration) pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded by the D. of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> That it would be abſolutely neceſſary to have ſome Common Bank of 25 or 30000 <hi>l.</hi> to Anſwer the Occaſions of ſuch an Undertaking. Nothing was done, but theſe things were offered then to our Conſideration, and we were to bring in our United Advice concerning them. But the Laſt and greateſt was How we might ſo order it as to draw <hi>Scotland</hi> into a conſent with us, for we thought it neceſſary that all the Diverſion ſhould be given. This was the Laſt.</p>

                  <p>No, I think not. However it was but opinion, the thing that was ſaid, was Jocoſely, rather than any thing elſe, that my Lord of <hi>Eſſex</hi> had dealing in Mony, and therefore he was thought the moſt proper Perſon to take the care of thoſe things; but this was ſaid rather by way of Mirth, then otherwiſe.</p>

                  <p>No my Lord, I tell you that I was forced to go three Weeks upon the account of my Eſtate, and afterwards I was neceſſitated to go to the <hi>Bath,</hi> where I ſpent five Weeks, and the time of coming from the <hi>Bath</hi> to this time, is five Weeks more; ſo that all this time hath been a perfect <hi>Parentheſis</hi> to me, &amp; more then this, I know not.</p>

And that to that purpoſe choice was made of the Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> my Lord of <hi>Eſsex,</hi> your Lordſhip, my Lord <hi>Howard,</hi> Colonel <hi>Sidney,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Hambden.</hi>

He does ſwear your Lordſhip was at that Meeting, and he delivered his Errand to them, which was to know what account could be given concerning the Deſign of the Inſurrection at <hi>Taunton,</hi> and he ſays, your Lordſhip being there, this Return was made, That Mr. <hi>Trenchard</hi> had ſailed them in his Undertaking in the Buſineſs, and therefore my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> muſt be contented, and ſit down ſatisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as to that time.

And then my Lord <hi>Howard</hi> (after a great diſcourſe concerning the many deſigns of my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury</hi>) comes particularly to your Lordſhip and ſays, that Six of you, as a choſen Councel among your ſelves, (not that you were actually choſen) but as a choſen Counſel among your ſelves, did undertake to manage the great matter of the Inſurrection, and Raiſing of Men in order to ſurprize the Kings Guards, and for to Riſe, (which is a Rebellion in the Nation.) He ſays that you had ſeveral Conſults con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning it. I told you the ſeveral particulars of thoſe Conſults he mentioned; Now it is fit for your Lordſhip, and 'tis your time to give ſome anſwer to theſe things.</p>

                  <p>My Lord, I cannot but think my ſelf mighty unfortunate to ſtand here charged with ſo High and Hainous a Crime, and that intricated and intermixed with the Treaſons and horrid Practiſes and Speeches of other People, the Kings Council taking all advantages, and improving and heightning things againſt me. I am no Lawyer, a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry unready ſpeaker, and altogether a ſtranger to things of this Nature, and alone and without Councel. Truly my Lord, I am very ſenſible, I am not ſo provided to make my juſt defence as otherwiſe I ſhould do. But my Lord, you are equal, and the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of the Jury, I think, are Men of Conſciences, they are Strangers to me, and I hope they value Innocent Blood, and will conſider the Witneſſes that Swear againſt me, Swear to ſave their own Lives, for howſoever Legal Witneſſes they may be accounted, they can't be Credible. And for Col. <hi>Romſey,</hi> who it's notoriouſly known hath been ſo High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Obliged by the King and the Duke, for him to be capable of ſuch a deſign of Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the King! I think no body will wonder, if to ſave his own Life, he will endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to take away mine; neither does he Swear enough to do it. And then if he did, the Time by the 13th of this King is Elapſed, it muſt be, as I underſtand by the Law, Proſecuted within 6 Months, and by the 25 <hi>E.</hi> 3. a deſign of Levying War, is no Treaſon unleſs by ſome overt Act it appear. And my Lord, I deſire to know what Statute I am to be Tried upon, for Generals, I think, are not to be gone upon in theſe Caſes.</p>

                     <stage>To the <hi>Attorney General</hi>
                     </stage> Mr. <hi>Attorney,</hi> You hear what it is my Lord Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects to this Evidence, He ſays that as to thoſe Witneſſes that Teſtify any thing concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning him, above ſix Months before he was Proſecuted, he conceives the Act of Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament, upon which he takes himſelf to be Indicted, does not extend to it, for that ſays that within ſix Moneths there ought to have been a Proſecution, and my Lord tells you,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:35626:13"/>
that he is adviſed, that a deſign of Levying War, without actual Levying of War, was not Treaſon before that Statute.</p>

                  <p>To ſatisfy my Lord, He is not Indicted upon that Statute. We go upon the 25 <hi>E.</hi> 3. But then for the next Objection: ſurely my Lord is informed wrong. To Raiſe a Rebellion or a Conſpiracy within the Kingdom, is it not that which is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Levying of War in that Statute, but to Raiſe a Number of men to break Priſons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Which is not ſo directly tending againſt the Life of the King. To prepare Forces to Fight againſt the King, that is a deſign within that Statute to Kill the King; And to deſign to depoſe the King, to impriſon the King, to raiſe the Subjects againſt the King, theſe have been ſetled by ſeveral Reſolutions to be within that Statute, and Evidences of a Deſign of killing the King.</p>

                  <p>I muſt deſire to ſay ſomething of my Self and my Family firſt, My Lord and I have been very intimate, not only as Relations, but as dear Friends, My Lord, I have been of a Family knovvn to have great Reſpect and Duty for the King, and I think there is no Family in the Nation ſo numerous, that hath expreſſed greater Loyalty, upon vvhich account I improved my Intereſt in my Lord <hi>Howard</hi>; I endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured, upon the great Miſunderſtanding of the Nation, (if he be here he knows it,) to perſuade him to apply himſelf to the King, to ſerve him in that great difficulty of State, which is known to all the World. I ſometimes found my Lord very forward, and ſometimes I ſoftened him, upon which, partly upon his Permiſſion, and more upon my own Inclination of Duty, I made ſeveral applications to Miniſters of State, (and I can name them) That my Lord <hi>Howard</hi> had a great deſire of ſerving the King in the beſt way of Satisfaction, and particularly in the great Buſineſs of his Brother. I wonder'd there ſhould be ſo much ſharpneſs for a matter of Opinion, and I told my Lord ſo, and we had ſeveral Diſputes about it. My Lord, I do ſay this before I come to the thing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> After this I did partly by his permiſſion, and partly by my own inclination, to ſerve the King, becauſe I thought my Lord <hi>Howard</hi> a Man of Parts, and ſaw him a Man that had intereſt in the Nation, tell my Lord <hi>Feverſham,</hi> that I had prevailed with a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of mine, that may be he might think oppoſite, that perhaps might ſerve the King in this great Difficulty that is emergent, and particularly that of his Brother. My Lord <hi>Feverſham</hi> did receive it very kindly, and I writ a Letter to him, to let him know how I had ſoftned my Lord, and that it was my deſire he ſhould ſpeak with my Lord at <hi>Oxon.</hi> My Lord <hi>Feverſham</hi> gave me a very kind Account when he came again, but he told me—</p>

                  <p>Then, now Sir, I will come to the thing. Upon this ground, I had of my Lords kindneſs, I applied my ſelf to my Lord in this preſent Iſſue, on the breaking out of this Plot. My Lord I thought certainly as near as I could diſcern him, (for he took it upon his Honor, his Faith, and as much as if he had taken an Oath before a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate,) that he knew nothing of any Man concerned in this buſineſs, and particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of my Lord <hi>Ruſſell,</hi> whom he vindicated with all the honor in the World. My Lord, it is true, was afraid of his own Perſon, and as a Friend, and a Relation, I concealed him in my Houſe, and I did not think it was for ſuch a Conſpiracy, but I thought he was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to go to the <hi>Tower</hi> for nothing again. So that if my Lord <hi>Howard</hi> has the ſame Soul on <hi>Monday</hi> that he had a <hi>Sunday,</hi> this can't be true that he ſwears againſt my Lord <hi>Ruſſel.</hi> This I ſay upon my Reputation, and Honor, and ſomething I could ſay more, he added, he thought my Lord <hi>Ruſſell</hi> did not only unjuſtly ſuffer, but he took God and Men to Witneſs, He thought him the vvorthieſt Perſon in the World. I am very ſorry to hear any Man of my Name ſhould be Guilty of theſe things.</p>

Having been very much with my Lord of late, that is for a Month or ſix Weeks before this Plot came out, I have had occaſion to ſpeak with my Lord in private, about theſe Publick Matters. But I have always found that my Lord was againſt all kind of Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings, and thought it the greateſt Folly and Madneſs, till things ſhould come in a Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amentary way. I have had occaſion often to ſpeak with my Lord <hi>Ruſſel</hi> in private, and having my ſelf been againſt all kind of Riſings, or any thing that tended to the diſorder of the Publick; I have heard him profeſs Solemnly, he thought it would Ruine the beſt Cauſe in the World to take any of theſe irregular ways for the preſerving of it, and particularly my Lord hath expreſſed himſelf occaſionally of theſe two Perſons, my Lord <hi>Howard,</hi> and Col. <hi>Romſey.</hi> One of them, Col. <hi>Romſey,</hi> I ſaw once at my Lords Houſe, and he offered to ſpeak a little privatly. But my Lord told me he knew him but a little, I told him he was a Valiant Man, and acted his Part Valiantly in <hi>Portugal.</hi> He ſay'd he knew him little, and that he had nothing to do with him but in my Lord <hi>Shaftsburys</hi> buſineſs. He ſaid, for my Lord <hi>Howard,</hi> he was a Man of excellent Parts of Luxuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant Parts, but he had the luck not to be much truſted by any Party.

My Lord, I can hardly be provoked to make my own defence, leaſt this Noble Lord ſhould ſuffer, ſo willing I am to ſerve my Lord, who knows I can't want affection for him; my Lord, I do confeſs I did ſay it; for your Lordſhip well knows under what Circumſtances we were, I was at that time to out face the thing, both for my ſelf, and my Party, and I did not intend to come into this Place, and Act this Part. God knows how it is brought upon me, and with what unwilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs I do Suſtain it, but my Duty to God, the King, and my Country, requires it, but I muſt confeſs, I am very ſorry to carry it on thus far. My Lord, I do confeſs I did ſay ſo, and if I had been to Viſit my Lord <hi>Pemberton,</hi> I ſhould have ſay'd ſo, There is none of thoſe that know my Lord <hi>Ruſſel,</hi> but would ſpeak of my Lord <hi>Ruſſel,</hi> from thoſe Topicks of Honour, Modeſty, and Integrity, his whole Life deſerves it. And I muſt confeſs, I did frequently ſay, there was nothing of Truth in this, and I wiſh this may be for my Lords advantage. My Lord, will you ſpare me one thing more, becauſe that leans hard upon my Reputation, and if the Jury believe that I ought not to be believed, for I do think the Religion of an Oath, is not Tyed to a Place, but receives its Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation from the appeal we therein make to God, and I think, if I called God and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, to Witneſs to a Falſhood, I ought not to be believed now, But I will tell you, as to that, your Lordſhip knows, that every man that was Committed, was Committed for a deſign of Murdering the King, now I did lay hold on that part, for I was to carry my Knife cloſe between the Paring and the Apple, and I did ſay, that if I were an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to my Lord <hi>Ruſſel,</hi> and to the Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> and were called to be a Witneſs, I muſt have declared in the preſence of God and man, that I did not believe either of them had any deſign to Murder the King. I have ſaid this, becauſe I would not walk un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Character of a Perſon, that would be Perjured at the expence of ſo Noble a Perſons Life, and my own Soul.</p>

I ſhall declare to your Lordſhip that I am one that have always had a heart ſincerely Loyal and Affectionate to the King and the Government, the beſt Government in the World. I pray as ſincerely for the Kings hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py and long life as any man alive; and for me to go about to raiſe a Rebellion, which I looked upon as ſo wicked and unpracticable, is unlikely. Beſides, if I had been inclin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to it, by all the obſervation I made in the Country, there was no tendency to it. What ſome hot-headed people have done there, is another thing. A Rebellion can't be made now as it has been in former times; We have few great Men. I was always for the Government, I never deſired any thing to be redreſſed but in a Parliamentary and legal way. I have been always againſt Innovations, and all Irregularities whatſoever, and ſhall be as long as I live, whether it be ſooner or later. Gentlemen, I am now in your hands eternally, my Honor, my life, and all; and I hope the Heats and Animoſities that are amongſt you will not ſo byaſs you, as to make you in the leaſt inclined to find an Innocent Man guilty. I call to witneſs Heaven and Earth, I never had a deſign againſt the Kings Life in my life, nor never ſhall have. I think there is nothing proved againſt me at all, I am in your hands, God direct you.</p>

                  </speaker>
                  <p>My Lord, and you Gentlemen of the Jury, the Priſoner at the Bar ſtands Indicted for High Treaſon, in Conſpiring the Death of the King. The Overt Act that is laid to prove that Conſpiracy and imagination by, is the aſſembling in Council to raiſe Arms againſt the King, and raiſe a Rebellion here. We have proved that to you by Three Witneſſes. I ſhall endeavour, as clearly as I can, to ſtate the ſubſtance of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence to you, of every one of them, as they have delivered it.</p>
                  <p>The firſt Witneſs, Colonel <hi>Romſey</hi> comes, and he tells you of a Meſſage he was ſent of to Mr. <hi>Sheppards</hi> Houſe, to my Lord <hi>Ruſſel,</hi> with ſeveral other perſons who he was told would be there aſſembled together. And the Meſſage was, to know what readineſs they were in, what Reſolutions they were come to concerning the Riſing at <hi>Taunton.</hi> By this you do perceive that this Conſpiracy had made ſome progreſs, and was ripe to be put in action. My Lord <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> that had been a great Contriver in it, he had purſued it ſo far, as to be ready to riſe. This occaſioned the Meſſage from my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> to my Lord <hi>Ruſſel,</hi> and thoſe noble perſons that were met at Mr. <hi>Sheppards</hi> houſe, to know what the Reſolution was concerning the buſineſs of <hi>Taunton,</hi> which you have heard explained by an undertaking of Mr. <hi>Trenchards:</hi> That the anſwer was, they were diſappointed there, and they could not then be ready, and that my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> muſt be content. This Meſſage was delivered in preſence of my Lord <hi>Ruſſel</hi>; the Meſſenger had notice my Lord <hi>Ruſſel</hi> was there; the Anſwer was given as from them all, That at preſent they could not be ready, becauſe of that diſappointment. Col. <hi>Romſey</hi> went further, and he ſwears there was a Diſcourſe concerning the Surpriſe of the Guards; and the Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> my Lord <hi>Gray</hi> and Sir <hi>Thomas Armſtrong</hi> went to ſee in what poſture they were in, whether it were feaſible to ſurpriſe them, and they found them very remiſs; and that
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:35626:17"/>
account they brought back, as is proved to you by Mr. <hi>Sheppard,</hi> the other Witneſs, That it was a thing very feaſible. But to conclude with the ſubſtance of Col. <hi>Romſeys</hi> Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, he ſays, my Lord was privy to it, that he did diſcourſe among the reſt of it, though my Lord was not a man of ſo great Diſcourſe as the reſt, and did talk of a Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing. He told you there was a Riſing determined to be on the 19<hi>th</hi> of <hi>November</hi> laſt, which is the ſubſtance of Col. <hi>Romſeys</hi> Evidence.</p>
                  <p>Gentlemen, the next Witneſs is Mr. <hi>Sheppard,</hi> and his Evidence was this: he ſwears that about <hi>October</hi> laſt, Mr. <hi>Ferguſon</hi> came to him of a Meſſage from the Duke of <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth,</hi> to let him know, That he and ſome other perſons of Quality would be there that night, that accordingly they did meet, and my Lord <hi>Ruſſel</hi> was there likewiſe; that they did deſire to be private, and his Servants were ſent away; and that he was the man that did attend them. He ſwears there was a Diſcourſe concerning the way and method to ſeiſe the Guards; he goes ſo far, as to give an account of the Return of the Errand the Duke of <hi>Monmouh,</hi> my Lord <hi>Gray</hi> and Sir <hi>Thomas Armſtrong</hi> went upon, That it was feaſible, if they had Strength to do it. Then he went a little farther, and he told you there was a Paper read, that in his Evidence does not come up to my Lord <hi>Ruſſel,</hi> for he did not ſay my Lord <hi>Ruſſel</hi> was by, and I would willingly repeat nothing but what concerns the Priſoner. Therefore Col. <hi>Romſey</hi> and Mr. <hi>Sheppard</hi> agree in, That there was a Debate among them how to ſurpriſe the Guards, and whether that was feaſible, and Mr. <hi>Sheppard</hi> is poſitive as to the Return made upon the View.</p>
                  <p>The next Witneſs was my Lord <hi>Howard</hi>; he gives you an account of many things, and many things that he tells you are by hear-ſay. But I cannot but obſerve to you, that all this hear-ſay is confirmed by theſe two poſitive Witneſſes, and their Oaths agree with him in it. For my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> told him of the Diſappointment he had met with from theſe Noble perſons that would not join with him; and then he went from my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> to the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> to expoſtulate with him about it (for my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> was then ready to be in action) and that the Duke ſaid he always told him he would not engage at that time<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> This thing is confirmed to you by theſe two Witneſſes. Col. <hi>Romſey</hi> ſays, when he brought the Meſſage from my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> the anſwer was, They were not ready, my Lord muſt be contented.</p>
                  <p>Next he goes on with a diſcourſe concerning my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> (that does not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly come up to the Priſoner at the Bar, but it manifeſts there was a Deſign at that time) he had 10000 brisk Boys as he called them) ready to follow him upon the hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding up of his finger. But it was thought not ſo prudent to begin it, unleſs they could join all their Forces. So you hear in this they were diſappointed: And partly by another ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident too my Lord <hi>Howard</hi> had an apprehenſion it might be diſcovered, that was upon the Proclamation that came out forbidding Bonfires, to prevent the ordinary Tumults that uſed to be upon thoſe occaſions. Then my Lord <hi>Howard</hi> goes on and comes par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly to my Lord <hi>Ruſſel</hi>: for upon this diſappointment you find my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> thought fit to be gone. But after that, the Deſign was not laid aſide: for you hear they only told him all along they could not be ready at that time, but the Deſign went on ſtill to raiſe Arms, and then they took upon themſelves to conſult of the methods of it; and for the carrying it on with the greater ſecreſie, they choſe a ſelect Council of Six, which were the Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> my Lord of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> my Lord <hi>Howard,</hi> my Lord <hi>Ruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel,</hi> Mr. <hi>Hambden,</hi> and Col. <hi>Sidney.</hi> That accordingly they met at Mr <hi>Hambdens</hi> (there was their firſt meeting) and their Conſultation there was, how the Inſurrection ſhould be made, whether firſt in <hi>London,</hi> or whether in the Countrie, or whether both in <hi>London</hi> and in the Countrie at one time. They had ſome Debates among themſelves that it was fitteſt firſt to be in the Countrie; for if the King ſhould ſend his Guards down to ſuppreſs them, then the Citie that was then as well diſpoſed to riſe, would be without a Guard, and eaſily effect their deſigns here.</p>
                  <p>Their next meeting was at my Lord <hi>Ruſſels</hi> own houſe, and there their Debates were
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:35626:17"/>
ſtill about the ſame matter, how to get in <hi>Scotland</hi> to their aſſiſtance; and in order to that, they did intruſt Col. <hi>Sidney</hi> one of their Counſel to ſend a Meſſenger into <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> for ſome perſons to come hither, my L. <hi>Melvin,</hi> Sir <hi>H. Campbell,</hi> and Sir <hi>J Cockram.</hi> Accordingly Col. <hi>Sidneys</hi> ſends <hi>Aar. Smith,</hi> (but this is only what Col. <hi>Sidney</hi> told my Lord afterwards, That he had done it, but you ſee the fruit of it.) Accordingly they are come to Town, and Sir <hi>H. Campbell</hi> is taken by a Meſſenger upon his arrival; and he had been but four days in Town, and he had changed his Lodging three times.</p>
                  <p>Now, Gentlemen, this is the ſubſtance of the Evidence that hath been produced a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt my <hi>L. Ruſſel.</hi> My <hi>L. Ruſſel</hi> hath made ſeveral Objections, That he was acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally at this Meeting at Mr. <hi>Sheppards</hi> Houſe, and came about other buſineſs; but I muſt obſerve to you, that my Lord <hi>Ruſſel</hi> owned that he came along with the Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> and I think he ſaid he went away with him too. You obſerve what Mr. <hi>Sheppards</hi> Evidence was: Mr. <hi>Ferguſon</hi> came to tell him the Duke of <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth</hi> would come, and accordingly the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> did come, and brought his Companion with him, which was my Lord <hi>Ruſſel</hi>; and certainly they that met upon ſo ſecret an Affair, would never have brought one that had not been concerned. Gentlemen, there are other Objections my Lord hath made, and thoſe are in point of Law; but before I come to them, I would obſerve what he ſays to the ſecond Meeting. My Lord does not deny but that he did meet both at Mr. <hi>Hambdens</hi> Houſe and my Lords own: I think my Lord ſaid, they did meet only to diſcourſe of News; and my Lord <hi>Howard</hi> being a man of excellent Diſcourſe, they met for his Converſation. Gentlemen, you can't believe that this deſigned Meeting was for nothing, in this cloſe ſecret Meeting, that they had no Contrivance amongſt them. You have heard the Witneſs, he ſwears poſitively what the Converſation was; and you ſee the Fruit of it, Sir <hi>Hugh Campbells</hi> coming to Town, and abſconding when it is diſcovered. Now my Lord <hi>Ruſſel</hi> inſiſts upon it, That admitting theſe Facts be proved upon him, they amount to no more than to a Conſpiracy to levy War, and that that is not Treaſon within the Statute of 25 <hi>E.</hi> 3. and if it be only within the Statute of the 13<hi>th</hi> of this King, then 'tis out of time, that directs the Proſecution to be within ſix months. The Law is plainly otherwiſe. The Statute of the 13<hi>th</hi> of this King I will not now inſiſt upon, though I believe, if that be ſtrictly looked into, the Clauſe that ſays the Proſecution ſhall be within ſix months, does not refer to Treaſon, but only to the other Offences that are highly puniſhable by that Statute. For the Proviſo runs thus:</p>
                  <p>13. Car. 2. <hi>Provided always, that no perſon be proſecuted for any of the Offences in this Act mentioned, (other than ſuch as are made and declared to be High Treaſon) un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs it be by Order of the Kings Majeſty, his Heirs or Succeſſors, under his or their Sign Manual, or by Order of the Council-Table of His Majeſty, his Heirs or Succeſſors, directed unto the Attorney General for the time being, or ſome other of the Counſel learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to His Majeſty, His Heirs or Succeſſors for the time being: Nor ſhall any perſon or perſons by virtue of this preſent Act incur any the Penalties herein before mentioned, unleſs he or they be proſecuted within ſix months next after the Offence committed, and indicted thereupon within three months after ſuch Proſecution; any thing herein contained to the contrary notwithſtanding.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This word (Nor) is a continuation of the former Sentence, and the Exception of High Treaſon will go through all, and except that out of the Temporary Limitation of Treaſon: But this is High Treaſon within 25 <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. To conſpire to levy War, is an Overt Act to teſtifie the Deſign of the Death of the King. And the Error of my Lord <hi>Cook</hi> hath poſſily led my Lord into this miſtake. But this, Gentlemen, hath been determined; it was reſolved by all the Judges in the Caſe of my Lord <hi>Cobham,</hi> 1 <hi>Jac.</hi> A Conſpiracy to levy War againſt the Kings Perſon (as this was a Conſpiracy to ſeiſe the Guards) what does that tend to, but to ſeiſe the King? and that always
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:35626:18"/>
hath been taken to be High Treaſon. But there are ſome things called Levying of War in Law, that are not ſo directly againſt the King; as if a Number of Men go about to levy Men to overthrow all Incloſures, this by the generality of the Intent, and becauſe of the Conſequences, is accounted Levying War againſt the King. A Conſpiracy therefore to levy ſuch a War which by conſtruction only is againſt the King, perhaps that may not be ſuch an Overt Act as to teſtifie the Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the Death of the King; but other Conſpiracies to raiſe War againſt the King have alwaies bin ſo taken. 'Tis the Reſolution of the Judges in my <hi>L. Dyers Reports,</hi> the Caſe of Dr. <hi>Story</hi>; A Conſpiracie to invite a foreign Prince to make an Invaſion, though no Invaſion follow, is an Overt Act to prove conſpiring the Death of the King. And as it hath bin ſo taken, ſo it hath bin practiſed but of late daies. In the <hi>Kings Bench</hi> I take it, the Indictment againſt <hi>Plunket</hi> that was hanged, he was indicted for Conſpiring againſt the Life of the King, and his Charge went no farther than for raiſing of Arms, and invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the <hi>French</hi> King in; and he ſuffered. This is acknowledged by my <hi>L. Cook</hi>; for he himſelf ſaid in the Paragraph before that out of which this Advice to my <hi>L. Ruſſel</hi> is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted, That a Conſpiracy to invite a foreign Prince to invade the Kingdom, is a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracie againſt the life of the King. And in the next Paragraph, he ſaies an Overt Act of one Treaſon cannot be an Overt Act of another Treaſon; but conſtant Practice is againſt him in that: For what is more common, than to indict a man for Imagining the Death of the King, and to aſſign the Overt Act in a Conſpiracie to raiſe Arms againſt the King? and ſometimes they go on and ſay, Did levy War againſt the King. Now by my <hi>L. Cooks</hi> Rule, levying War, unleſs the Indictment be particular for that, is not an Overt Act for the compaſſing the Death of the King; but the contrary hath bin reſolved by all the Judges in the Caſe of Sir <hi>Hen. Vane,</hi> and it is the conſtant Practice to lay it ſo in Indictments. It would be a ſtrange conſtruction if this ſhould not be High Treaſon. 'Tis agreed by e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very body, to take the King Priſoner, to ſeiſe the King, that is a compaſſing the Death of the King: and to ſit in council to conſpire to effect that, that is an Overt Act of the Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination of the Death of the King: now no man can diſtinguiſh this Caſe fom that. And this Conſultation amounted to all this; for plainly hither it tended. The Conſultation was to ſeiſe upon the Kings Guards, that could have no other ſtop but to ſeiſe upon the Kings Perſon, and bring him into their Power. As to the Killing of the King, I am apt to think that was below the Honor of the Priſoner at the Bar; but this is equal Treaſon: If they deſigned only to bring the King into their Power, till he had conſented to ſuch things as ſhould be moved in Parliament, 'tis equally Treaſon, as if they had agreed directly to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaſinate him. Therefore I think there is nothing for you to conſider, but to ſee that the Fact be fully proved: and I ſee nothing that hath been ſaid by my <hi>L. Ruſſel</hi> that does in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>validate our Evidence. He hath produced ſeveral Witneſſes, Perſons of Honor: my <hi>L. Angleſy</hi> tells you of a Diſcourſe my <hi>L. Howard</hi> had with my <hi>L.</hi> of <hi>Bedford</hi>; That he told my <hi>L.</hi> of <hi>Bedford</hi> that he needed not to fear, for he had a wife and underſtanding Son, and could not think he ſhould be guilty of any ſuch thing as was laid to his Charge. This is brought to invalidate my <hi>L. Howards</hi> Teſtimony. Gentlemen, do but obſerve, My <hi>L. Howard</hi> was as deep in as any of them, and was not then diſcovered: Is it likely that my L. <hi>Howard,</hi> that lay hid, ſhould diſcover to my <hi>L.</hi> of <hi>Bedford</hi> that there was a Conſpiracy to raiſe Arms, and that he was in it? This would have been an aſperſion upon my Lord of <hi>Bedford,</hi> that any ſuch thing ſhould have been ſaid.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Edw. Howard</hi> is the next, and he proves, That my <hi>L. Howard</hi> uſed ſolemn Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtations that he knew nothing of this Conſpiracy. I did obſerve, that worthy Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in the beginning of his Diſcourſe (for it was pretty long) ſaid firſt, That he had been ſeveral times tempting my Lord <hi>Howard</hi> to come over, and be ſerviceable to the King, and if he knew any thing, that he would come and confeſs it. Why Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, Mr. <hi>Howard</hi> that had come to him upon theſe Errands formerly, and had thought he had gained him, I conceive you do not wonder if my Lord <hi>Howard</hi> did not reveal
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:35626:18"/>
himſelf to him, who preſently would have diſcovered it; for, for that arrand he came. But if my Lord had had a deſign to have come in and ſaved his Life, he would have made his Submiſſion voluntarily, and made his Diſcovery. But my Lord tells nothing till he is pinched in his Conſcience, and confounded with the Guilt (being then in Cuſtody) and then he tells the whole Truth, that which you have heard this day.</p>
                  <p>Gentlemen, this hath been all that hath been objected againſt the Witneſſes except what is ſaid by Dr. <hi>Burnet</hi>; and he ſaies that my L. <hi>Howard</hi> declared to him, that he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved there was no Plot, and laughed at it. Why Gentlemen, the Doctor would take it ill to be thought a perſon fit to be intruſted with the diſcovery of this; therefore what he ſaid to him ſignifies nothing, for 'tis no more than this, that he did not diſcover it to the Doctor.</p>
                  <p>But the laſt Objection (which I ſee there has been a great many Perſons of Honour and Quality called to) is, That 'tis not likely my Lord <hi>Ruſſel</hi> ſhould be guilty of any thing in this kind, being a man of that Honor, Vertue, and ſo little blamable in his whole Converſation. I do confeſs Gentlemen this is a thing that hath weight in it. But conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der on the other hand, my Lord <hi>Ruſſel</hi> is but a man, and hath his humane frailties about him. Men fall by ſeveral temptations; ſome out of revenge, ſome by malice fall into ſuch offences as theſe are: my Lord <hi>Ruſſel</hi> is not of that temper, and therefore may be theſe are not the ingredients here. But Gentlemen, there is another great and dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous temptation that attends people in his circumſtances, whether it be Pride or Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or the cruel ſnare of Popularity, being cried up as a Patron of Liberty. This hath been a dangerous temptation to many, and many perſons of Vertue have fallen into it, and 'tis the only way to tempt perſons of Vertue; and the Devil knew it, for he that tempted the Pattern of Vertue, ſhew'd him all the Kingdoms of the World, and ſaid, <hi>All theſe will I give thee, if thou wilt fall down and worſhip me.</hi> Though he be a perſon of Vertue, yet it does not follow, but his Vertue may have ſome weak part in him. And I am afraid, theſe temptations have prevailed upon my Lord. For I cannot give my ſelf any colour of objection to disbelieve all theſe Witneſſes who give in their teſtimony. I ſee no contradiction, no correſpondence, no contrivance at all between them. You have plain Oaths before you, and I hope you will conſider the weight of them, and the great conſequence that did attend this Caſe, the overthrow of the beſt Government in the World, and the beſt and moſt unſpotted Religion, which muſt needs have ſuffered; the greateſt Liberty and the greateſt Security for Property that ever was in any Nation, bounded every way by the rules of Law, and thoſe kept ſacred. I hope you will conſider the weight of this Evidence, and conſider the conſequences ſuch a Conſpiracy, if it had taken effect, might have had. And ſo I leave it to your conſideration upon the Evidence you have heard.</p>

                  <speaker>Sir <hi>Geo. Jeff.</hi>
                  </speaker>
                  <p>My Lord, and you Gentlemen of the Jurie, this Cauſe hath detained your Lordſhip a long time, by reaſon of ſo many Witneſſes being called, and the length of the defence made by the Priſoner at the Bar; and if it had not been for the length of the time, I would not have injured your patience by ſaying any thing, Mr. Sollicitor having taken ſo much pains in it. It is a duty incumbent upon me, under the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances I now ſtand, to ſee if any thing hath been omitted that hath not been obſerved to you; and I ſhall detain you with very few words.</p>
                  <p>Gentlemen, you muſt give me leave to tell you, 'tis a Caſe of great conſequence, of great conſequence to that Noble Perſon that now is at the Bar, as well as to the King: for it is not deſired by the King nor by his Counſel, to have you influenced in this matter by any thing but by the Truth, and what Evidence you have received. In the next place, you are not to be moved by any compaſſion or pity: the Oath you have taken is to go according to your Evidence; and you are not to be moved by any Inſinuations that are offered by us for the King, nor by any inſinuations by the Priſoner at the Bar; but the Truth according to the Teſtimony given muſt be your guide. How far the Law will
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:35626:19"/>
affect this Queſtion, that we are not to apply to you for; for that we are to apply our ſelves to the Court (they are the Judges in point of Law) who will take ſo much care in their directions to you, that you may be very well ſatisfied you will not eaſily be led into error. For the inſtances that have been put, I could put ſeveral others; But I will take notice only of one thing that that Noble Perſon at the Bar ſeems to Object. Gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemen, it is not neceſſary there ſhould be two Witneſſes to the ſelf ſame Fact, at the ſelf ſame time; but if there be two Witneſſes tending to the ſelf-ſame Fact, though it was at ſeveral times, and upon ſeveral occaſions, they will be in point of Law two Witneſſes which are neceſſary to convict a Man for High-Treaſon. Gentlemen, I make no doubt this thing is known to you all, not only by the Judgment of all the Judges in <hi>England,</hi> but the Judgment of the Lords in Parliament, when I doubt not the Priſoner at the Bar did attend in the Caſe of my Lord <hi>Stafford,</hi> wherein one Witneſs gave an account of a Conſpiracy in <hi>England, Turbervile</hi> of another in <hi>France</hi>; and by the Opinion of all my Lords the Judges, approved in Parliament, that was enough, and he was convicted.</p>
                  <p>The Queſtion is, whether we have ſufficiently proved this matter. Gentlemen, I muſt tell you, we take no Gaols, nor bring any proſligate Perſons, Perſons that wanted Faith or Credit before this time. I muſt tell you, that notwithſtanding the fair notice that hath been given to the Priſoner at the Bar (that you ſee he hath taken an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of it, he hath given an account of a private Converſation with my Lord <hi>Howard</hi> before that Noble Perſon that was Witneſs againſt him was taken) he has not given you in all his Proof hitherto, nay I ſay, he has not pretended any thing in the World: wherefore you Gentlemen that are upon your Oaths, ſhould take it upon your Conſciences, that two Men, againſt whom there is no Objection, ſhould come to damn their own Souls to take away the life of this Gentleman; when there is no Quarrel, no Temptation, wherefore theſe Gentlemen ſhould come in the face of a Court of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, in the face of ſuch an Auditory, without reſpect to that infinite Being to whom they appeal for confirmation of the Truth of their Teſtimony: and if they had the Faith of Men or Chriſtians, they muſt neceſſarily conclude, that if they did ſwear to take away a mans Life that was innocent, God would ſink them down preſently into Hell.</p>
                  <p>Gentlemen, in the next place I muſt acquaint you, that the firſt Witneſs Col. <hi>Romſey,</hi> it is apparent he was taken notice of by the Priſoner as a man fit to be truſted; he was engaged by my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury</hi>: But ſays he, would any man believe, that that man that had received ſo many Marks of the Kings Favour, both in advantage to his Eſtate, his Honour and Perſon, could be ever contriving ſuch an Helliſh Deſign as this? Gentlemen, if you will argue from ſuch uncertain Conjectures, then all Criminals will come off. Who ſhould think that my Lord of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> who had been advanced ſo much in his Eſtate and Honour, ſhould be guilty of ſuch deſperate things! which had he not been conſcious of, he would ſcarcely have brought himſelf to that untimely end, to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void the Methods of publick Juſtice. Col. <hi>Romſey</hi> tells you my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in this Conſpiracy. I am ſorry to find that there hath been ſo many of the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of this Land that have Lived ſo happily under the benign influence of a gracious Prince, ſhould make ſo ill returns. Gentlemen, I muſt appeal to you whether in your obſervation you found Col. <hi>Romſey</hi> to be over-haſty and an over-zealous Witneſs; he did not come as if he came in ſpight to the Priſoner at the Bar: you found how we were forced to pump out every thing,; but after he had been preſſed over and over a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, then he came to it: So that I obſerve to you, that he was an unwilling Witneſs.</p>
                  <p>Gentlemen, give me leave to obſerve to you, the Priſoner at the Bar, before ſuch time as Mr. <hi>Sheppard</hi> came up and gave evidence againſt him, ſays he, I come only by accident, only to taſt a parcel of wine. Mr <hi>Sheppard</hi> when he comes up, he tells you, there was no ſuch deſign. <hi>Ferguſon</hi> (that was the perſon he kept company with, the Reverend Dean and the reſt of the Clergy of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> they were not fit to be truſted with it, but this Independent Perſon <hi>Ferguſon</hi>) he gives notice of the coming of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:35626:19"/>
and in purſuance of this notice they all come, they come late in the Evening, not in the poſture and quality they uſe to go, for you find they had not ſo much as a Coach. Is it probable they came to taſt Wine? Wherefore did they go up into a room? Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore did they order Mr. <hi>Sheppard</hi> that none of the Boys ſhould come up, but that the Maſter muſt fetch the Sugar and Wine himſelf? wherefore you may perceive the Action they were upon, there were only to be ſuch perſons as had an affection for ſuch a cauſe. You find purſuant to what Col. <hi>Romſey</hi> ſays, that there was a direction to take a view of the Guards, that Sir <hi>Tho. Armſtrong</hi> comes back and makes this Report: ſays he, I have taken notice they are in ſuch an idle careleſs poſture, that it is not impoſſible to ſurprize them. This Mr. <hi>Sheppard</hi> he does not come, nor does he appear to you to come here out of any vindictive humor, to do the Priſoner at the Bar any hurt.</p>
                  <p>In the next place we have my Lord <hi>Howard,</hi> he comes and poſitively tells you after he had given an account (for you obſerve there were two parts to be acted in this horrid Tragedy, there was, firſt, the Scoundrel ſort of People were to be concerned to take away the Life of the King and the Duke, the Great Perſons were to head the Party in the Riſing) they put themſelves in proper poſtures, each of them conſenting to ſomething of the Surprize, in as much as you obſerve that Sir <hi>Thomas Armſtrong</hi> and ſome other Perſons might not be truſted. They come and reſolve themſelves out of a General Council, and they meet in a particular Council of Six, looking upon themſelves as the Heads of the Party: And I muſt tell you many of them (we live not in an age of ſuch obſcurity, but we know them) how fond have they been of the applauſe of the people! As that perſon encouraged himſelf, yeſterday they were <hi>Liberatores Patriae</hi> that could Murder the King and the Duke.</p>
                  <p>My Lord, I muſt take notice that this noble Lord is known to have an intimacy with him; you obſerve with how much tenderneſs he is pleaſed to deliver himſelf, how carefully he reports the Debates of the particular Conſults of the perſons to be intruſted in the management; he tells you that Noble Lord the Priſoner at the Bar was pitched upon, and <hi>Algernoon Sidney,</hi> a man Famous about the Town, for what? To call in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties from ſome of his Majeſties other Dominions, perſons we know ripe enough for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion, to aſſiſt. Purſuant to this, you find perſons ſent of a Meſſage for ſome to come over, whereof ſome are in hold: So that for all dark and obſcure ſort of matters, nothing can be better brought to light than this, of taking all matters together, with the concurring Circumſtances of Time and Place.</p>
                  <p>Gentlemen, I muſt confeſs this Noble Lord hath given an account by ſeveral Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable perſons of his Converſation; which is a very eaſie matter. Do you think if any man had a deſign to raiſe a Rebellion againſt the Crown, that he would talk of it to the Reverend Divines, and the Noble Lords that are known to be of Integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to the Crown? Do you think the Gentleman at the Bar would have ſo little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern for his own life, to make this Diſcourſe his ordinary Converſation? No it muſt be a particular Conſult of Six, that muſt be intruſted with this. I tell you, 'tis not the Divines of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> but an Independent Divine, that is to be concerned in this; they muſt be perſons of their own complexion and humour. For Men will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply themſelves to proper Inſtruments.</p>
                  <p>Gentlemen, I would not labour in this caſe; for far be it from any man to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to take away the Life of the Innocent. And whereas that Noble Lord ſays, he hath a vertuous good Lady, he hath many Children, he hath Vertue and Honour he puts into the Scale: Gentlemen, I muſt tell you on the other ſide, you have Conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, Religion; you have a Prince, and a mercifull one too; conſider the life of your Prince, the life of his Poſterity, the conſequences that would have attended if this Villany had taken effect. What would have become of your Lives and Religion? what would have become of that Religion we have been ſo fond of preſerving? Gentlemen, I muſt put theſe things home upon your Conſciences. I know you will remember the horrid
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:35626:20"/>
Murder of that moſt pious Prince, the Martyr King <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt. How far the Practices of thoſe perſons have influenced the ſeveral Puniſhments ſince, is too great a ſecret for me to examine. But now, I ſay, you have the Life of a merciful King, you have a Religion that every honeſt man ought to ſtand by, and I am ſure every loyal man will venture his Life and Fortune for. You have your Wives and Children. Let not the Greatneſs of any man corrupt you, but diſcharge your Conſciences both to God and the King, and to your Poſterity.</p>

                  <p>Gentlemen of the Jury, the Priſoner at the Bar ſtands indicted before you of High Treaſon, in compaſſing and deſigning the Death of the King, and in declaring of it by Overt Acts; endeavouring to raiſe Inſurrections and popular Commotions in the Kingdom here. To this he hath pleaded not Guilty. You have heard the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence that hath been againſt him, it hath been at large repeated by the Kings Counſel, which will take off a great deal of my trouble in repeating it to you again. I know you cannot but take notice of it, and remember it, it having been ſtated twice by two of the Kings Counſel to you; 'tis long, and you ſee what the parties here have proved. There is firſt of all Col. <hi>Romſey,</hi> he does atteſt a Meeting at Mr. <hi>Sheppards</hi> Houſe, and you hear to what purpoſe he ſays it was; the Meſſage that he brought, and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn he had; it was to enquire concerning a Riſing at <hi>Taunton</hi>; and that he had in Return to my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> was, that Mr. <hi>Trenchard</hi> had failed them, and my Lord muſt be contented, for it could not be at that time. You hear that he does ſay, that they did deſign a Riſing; he ſaith, there was a Riſing deſigned in <hi>November,</hi> I think, he ſaith the 17<hi>th,</hi> upon the day of Qu. <hi>Elizabeths</hi> Birth. You hear he does ſay, There was at that Meeting ſome Diſcourſe concerning inſpecting the Kings Guards, and ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing how they kept themſelves, and whether they might be ſurpriſed; and this he ſays was all in order to a Riſing. He ſays that at this my Lord <hi>Ruſſel</hi> was preſent. Mr. <hi>Sheppard</hi> does ſay that my Lord <hi>Ruſſel</hi> was there: That he came into this Meeting with the Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> and he did go away with the Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> as he believes. He ſays, there was ſome Diſcourſe of a Riſing, or Inſurrection, that was to be procured within the Kingdom; but he does not tell you the particulars of any thing, he himſelf does not. My Lord <hi>Howard</hi> afterwards does come and tell you of a great Diſcourſe he had with my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> in order to a Riſing in the City of <hi>London,</hi> and my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> did value himſelf mightily upon 10000 Men he hoped to raiſe; and a great deal of Diſcourſe he had with my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury.</hi> This he does by way of Inducement to what he ſays concerning my Lord <hi>Ruſſel.</hi> The Evidence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him is ſome Conſults that there were by Six of them, who took upon them, as he ſays, to be a Council for the Management of the Inſurrection that was to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured in this Kingdom. He inſtances in two that were for this purpoſe; the one of them at Mr. <hi>Hambdens</hi> Houſe, the other at my Lord <hi>Ruſſels</hi> Houſe. And he tells you, at theſe Meetings there was ſome Diſcourſe of providing Treaſure, and of provid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Arms, but they came to no Reſult in theſe things. He tells you, that there was a Deſign to ſend for ſome of the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland,</hi> that might join with them in this thing. And this is upon the matter the ſubſtance of the Evidence that hath been at large declared to you by the Kings Counſel, and what you have heard. Now, Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, I muſt tell you, ſome things it lies upon us to direct you in</p>
                  <p>My Lord excepts to theſe Witneſſes, becauſe they are concern'd by their own ſhewing in this Deſign: If there were any, I did direct (ſome of you might hear me) yeſterday, that that was no ſufficient exception againſt a mans being an Evidence in the caſe of Treaſon, that he himſelf was concerned in it; they are the moſt proper perſons to be Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, none being able to detect ſuch Councils<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but them. You have heard my Lord <hi>Ruſſels</hi> Witneſſes that he hath brought concerning them, and concerning his own inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity and courſe of life, how it has been ſober and civil, with a great reſpect to Religion, as theſe Gentlemen do all teſtifie, Now the Queſtion before you will be, whether up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:35626:20"/>
this whole matter you do believe my Lord <hi>Ruſſel</hi> had any deſign upon the Kings life, to deſtroy the King, or take away his life, for that is the material part here. 'Tis uſed and given you (by the Kings Counſel,) as an evidence of this, That he did conſpire to raiſe an Inſurrection; and to cauſe a Riſing of the people, to make as it were a Rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on within the Nation, and to ſurpriſe the Kings Guards, which ſay they can have no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther end but to ſeiſe and deſtroy the King; and 'tis a great evidence (if my Lord <hi>Ruſſel</hi> did deſign to ſeiſe the Kings Guards, and make an Inſurrection in the Kingdom) of a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign for to ſurpriſe the Kings Perſon. It muſt be leſt to you upon the whole matter: You have not evidence in this Caſe as there was in the other matter that was tried in the morning or yeſterday, againſt the Conſpirators to Kill the King at the <hi>Rye.</hi> There was a direct evidence of a Conſult to Kill the King, that is not given you in this Caſe; this is an act of contriving Rebellion and an Inſurrection within the Kingdom, and to ſeiſe his Guards, which is urged as an evidence, and ſurely is in it ſelf an evidence to ſeiſe and deſtroy the King.</p>
                  <p>Upon this whole matter this is left to you. If you believe the Priſoner at the Bar to have conſpired the Death of the King, and in order to that to have had theſe Conſults that theſe Witneſſes ſpeak of, then you muſt find him Guilty of this Treaſon that is laid to his Charge.</p>

                  <p>But Mr. Recorder, If all that the Witneſſes ſwore againſt me be true, I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to you and the Court, I appeal to you whether I am Guilty within the Statute of 25 <hi>E.</hi> 3. they having ſworn a Conſpiracy to levy War; but no intention of Killing the King: And therefore I think truly Judgment ought not to paſs upon me for Conſpiring the death of the King, of which there was no proof by any one Witneſs.</p>

                  <p>That is no Exception.</p>

                  </speaker>
                  <p>My Lord, that was an Exception proper (and as I think you did make it) before the Verdict; whether the Evidence does amount to prove the Charge, that
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:35626:21" rendition="simple:additions"/>
is proper to be obſerved to the Jury; for if the Evidence come ſhort of the Indictment, they can't find it to be a true Charge; But when the Jury has found it, their Verdict does paſs for truth. We are bound by the Verdict as well as your Lordſhip we are to go by what the Jury have found, not their Evidence.</p>

                  <speaker>Mr. Recorder.</speaker>
                  <p>The Jury muſt be governed by their Evidence.</p>

                  <p>I think it very hard I muſt be condemned upon a point that there was not one thing of it ſworn, therefore I think I may very legally demand Arreſt of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>

                  <p>I hope your Lordſhip will conſider 'tis not the Court can give a Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict, it muſt be the Jury. I believe their is no body in the Court does delight in giving ſuch Judgments, eſpecially againſt your Lordſhip. The Verdict is found, and the Kings Attorney General on behalf of the King does demand it.</p>

                  <p>My Lord <hi>Ruſſel,</hi> your Lordſhip hath been Indicted, and Tried, and found Guilty of High Treaſon, the greateſt of Crimes, your Quality is great, and your Crime is great. And I hope and expect that your behaviour and preparation in this Condition will be proportionable. My Lord, it is the Duty of the Witneſſes to give Evidence according to Truth, it is the Duty of the Jury to proceed according to Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. and 'tis the Duty of the Court to give Evidence according to the Verdict. It is the Kings pleaſure ſignified by his Attorny General, to demand Judgment againſt your Lordſhip according to this Verdict, and therefore my Lord I ſhall not delay it with any further circumlocution. The Judgment the Law hath provided, and is the Duty of the Court to give, is,</p>
               </sp>
               <stage>That you be carried back again, to the place from whence you came, and from thence be drawn upon an Hurdle to the place of Execution; where you shall be hanged by the neck, but cut down alive, your Entrals and Privy Members cut from your Body, and burnt in your ſight, your Head to be ſevered from your Body, and your Body divided into four Parts, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſed at the Kings pleaſure. And the Lord have Mercy upon your Soul.</stage>
