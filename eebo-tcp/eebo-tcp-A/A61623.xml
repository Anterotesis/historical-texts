            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

SERMON
Preached before the
KING and QUEEN
At WHITE-HALL,
<date>Novemb. 29. 1691.</date>
            </head>
            <epigraph>
               <bibl>1 Samuel II. 30.</bibl>
               <q>For them that honour me I will honour;
and they that despise me shall be
lightly esteemed.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THese Words were spoken by a <hi>Prophet</hi>
of the <hi>Lord</hi> to <hi>Eli,</hi> at that time, the
<hi>High Priest</hi> and <hi>Iudge</hi> over <hi>Israel,</hi> upon
Occasion of the Wickedness of his Sons, and the
<hi>Dishonour</hi> brought upon Religion thereby; which
was so great that it is said,<note place="margin">v. 17.</note> 
               <hi>they made the People
abhor the Offering of the Lord.</hi> But that we may
the better comprehend their Scope and Design,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:101604:3"/>
there are some remarkable particulars to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered;
with respect to the Circumstances that
attend them.</p>
            <p>(1.) That their Sins were of a high and scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous
Nature, being an open Affront both to
the Ceremonial and Moral Law. <hi>The Offering of
the Lord</hi> was that which himself had appointed in
the Law of <hi>Moses;</hi> wherein it was expresly requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
that the <hi>Fat of the Sacrifices</hi> of Peace-Offerings
must <hi>be burnt upon the Altar,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Levit. 7. 31.</note> and after that, the
Joints were to be divided, and the Priest was to
have his share,<note place="margin">v. 33, 34.</note> and the People that offer'd them
the rest. But these Sons of <hi>Eli</hi> thought themselves
too great to be tied up to such a strict obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
of the Niceties of the Law; and therefore
they sent their Servants to demand what they
pleased without any Regard to that Order which
the Law appointed.<note place="margin">v. 13, 14, 15, 16.</note> It is possible, they might
<hi>think</hi> (although such lewd and profane Persons
are not much given to <hi>thinking</hi>) that the matter
was not great, how, or in what manner, they took
the share which belong'd to them; but God, who
best knew what was pleasing to himself, saith, <hi>The
Sin of the young Men was very great before the Lord.</hi>
               <note place="margin">v. 17.</note>
For God will and ought to be served in his own
Way, and they, who thought to be Wiser than
his Laws, smarted for their Folly. Thus <hi>Nadab</hi>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:101604:3"/>
and <hi>Abihu</hi> (two brisk young Men) had a mind
to try the Experiment of offering <hi>strange Fire be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Lord</hi> (not taking it from the Altar as God
had appointed.)<note place="margin">Levit. 10. 1.</note> And what came of this Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptuous
violation of God's Law?<note place="margin">Levit. 1. 7.</note> They were
immediately consumed by <hi>a strange Fire</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves;<note place="margin">ch. 6. v. 12.</note>
for,<note place="margin">ch. 16. v. 12.</note> it is said,<note place="margin">ch. 10. v. 2.</note> 
               <hi>A Fire went out from the Lord
and devoured them, and they died before the Lord;
i.e.</hi> they were struck dead with Lightning upon
the Place, and their dead Bodies were carried
forth <hi>from before the Sanctuary out of the Camp;</hi>
               <note place="margin">v. 4.</note>
that all the People might observe the Truth of
what <hi>Moses</hi> said to <hi>Aaron</hi> on this Occasion: <hi>This
is that the Lord spake,</hi>
               <note place="margin">v. 3.</note> 
               <hi>saying, I will be sanctified
in them that come nigh me, and before all the People
I will be glorified.</hi> It is true, God did not punish
<hi>Hophni</hi> and <hi>Phinehas</hi> in the same manner, who
added great Lewdness and Immorality to their
other faults;<note place="margin">v. 22.</note> but He severely threatens the whole
House of <hi>Eli</hi> for their Sins; and as a sign of the
rest, he declares, that these profligate Wretches
should both be taken off the same day;<note place="margin">v. 34.</note> Which
was accordingly accomplished with dreadfull
Circumstances;<note place="margin">ch. 4. v. 11.</note> For, <hi>the Ark of God was taken</hi> at
the same time.</p>
            <p>(2.) That the House of <hi>Eli</hi> was advanced to
that Dignity which it then enjoy'd by an Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:101604:4"/>
Method of Providence: For, when <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dab</hi>
and <hi>Abihu</hi> the Sons of <hi>Aaron</hi> were destroy'd,
there remained <hi>Eleazar</hi> and <hi>Ithamar,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Levit. 10. 6.</note> (for the other
died Childless,)<note place="margin">1 Chron. 24. 2.</note> from them descended two Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
of <hi>Aaron</hi>'s Family.<note place="margin">Numb. 3. 4.</note> 
               <hi>Eleazar</hi> was of the Elder
House; but <hi>Eli,</hi> who descended from <hi>Ithamar,</hi>
was in possession of the High Priesthood by God's
Approbation. And when <hi>Abiathar</hi> in <hi>Solomon</hi>'s
time was put by the High Priesthood, it is said
<hi>that he descended from Ithamar</hi> and was of the
House of <hi>Eli;</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Chron. 14. 2, 5.</note> and he was <hi>therefore thrust out that
God might fulfill his Word,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Kings 24. 27.</note> 
               <hi>which he spake concerning
the House of Eli in Shiloh.</hi> By which we find, that
God had raised up the House of <hi>Eli</hi> after an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
manner; and no doubt, according
to the Wise Methods of Divine Providence for
an Extraordinary End; and we find no ill Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
fixed upon <hi>Eli</hi> himself, although <hi>he had
judged Israel forty years;</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Sam. 4. 18.</note> but there were those a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
him and very near him, who were loose,
profane and dissolute Persons, and although, those
who are most concerned, do commonly hear the
last of the Miscarriages of those related to them;
yet the Cry was so great that it came to his Ears
and he took notice of it, and reproved them
for it;<note place="margin">ch. 2. v. 22, 23, 24, 25.</note> 
               <hi>And he said to them, why do ye such things?
&amp;c.</hi> The good old Man seems to be heartily
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:101604:4"/>
concerned and troubled for his Sons Follies; but
this did not answer God's End; for the Reason
He gives of the heavy Judgments denounced a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
his Family,<note place="margin">ch. 3. v. 13.</note> was, <hi>because his Sons made
themselves vile and he restrained them not.</hi> God ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects
something more than meer Words or bare
Reproofs, where his <hi>Honour</hi> and that of <hi>Religion</hi>
are so much concerned. But when Profaneness,
and Looseness and Irreligion crept in among
them and grew too hard for the Government,
God threatens to do such <hi>a thing in Israel,</hi>
               <note place="margin">ch. 3. v. 11.</note> 
               <hi>at which
hath the ears of every one that heareth it shall tingle.</hi>
I need go no farther.</p>
            <p>(3.) That although God was justly provoked
by the Sins of the House of <hi>Eli;</hi> yet there was a
concurrence of the Peoples Sins in bringing down
such severe and astonishing Judgments. There
was no great loss in <hi>Hophni</hi> and <hi>Phinehas,</hi> unless
they had been better; but it was a terrible Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to have <hi>the Ark of God</hi> taken, and carried
Captive; and thereby their whole Religion ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
to scorn and contempt among their
Neighbours, who hated them for the sake of
their Religion. For when the Idolatrous Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
about them had corrupted themselves and
the Worship of God, He was pleased by the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry
of <hi>Moses</hi> to set up a Form of Worship a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:101604:5"/>
the <hi>People</hi> of <hi>Israel</hi> according to his own
Will. This gave great Dissatisfaction to all their
Neighbours, and encreased their Spite and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice
against them; which they were ready to
shew on all Occasions; but never more than
when <hi>the Ark of God</hi> was taken Captive and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
about in Triumph among them: For this
was the <hi>Symbol</hi> of <hi>Gods</hi> particular <hi>Presence</hi> among
the People of <hi>Israel.</hi> The <hi>Tabernacle</hi> with all its
rich and admirable Furniture, was as his <hi>Court;</hi>
but the <hi>Holy</hi> of <hi>Holies,</hi> as his <hi>Chamber</hi> of <hi>Presence;</hi>
and there <hi>the Ark</hi> was the Place where God gave
his Answers to his People on great and Solemn
Occasions. And what could be more grievous
and dishonourable to them, than to have this <hi>Ark
of God</hi> carried away by their Enemies? For, then
the Name of the whole Nation might have been
<hi>Ichabod,</hi>
               <note place="margin">ch. 4. v. 22.</note> 
               <hi>for the Glory was departed from Israel.</hi>
But was all this meerly for the Sins of <hi>Hophm</hi>
and <hi>Phinehas?</hi> No; the Punishment on that
account related to the <hi>House</hi> of <hi>Eli;</hi> but this
was a Judgment on the whole Nation: And
God himself gives a sad Account of it, but it
was such, as reached to the Nature and Extent
of the Judgment. <hi>Go ye now,</hi> saith <hi>God</hi> in the
Prophet <hi>Ieremiah,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Jerem. 7. 12.</note> 
               <hi>unto my Place which was in Shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loh,
where I set my Name at the first, and see what
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:101604:5"/>
I did to it for the wickedness of my People Israel.</hi>
So that here was a Complication of the Sins of
all sorts to bring down so heavy a Judgment
upon them.</p>
            <p>And thus I have endeavour'd to clear the way
towards the right apprehending the full Scope
and Design of these words, <hi>Them that honour me
I will honour; and they that despise me shall be light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
esteemed.</hi> Wherein are two things to be spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
to;</p>
            <list>
               <item>I. The <hi>Nature</hi> of that <hi>Honour</hi> which is due
to God.</item>
               <item>
                  <hi>II. The</hi> Rules <hi>and</hi> Measures <hi>whereby God
bestows</hi> Honour <hi>on Mankind.</hi> Them that honour
me I will honour; and they that despise me, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p>(1.) The <hi>Nature</hi> of that <hi>Honour</hi> which is due
to God.</p>
            <p>There are three sorts of Men to be consider'd
with Respect to the <hi>Honour</hi> due to God;</p>
            <list>
               <item>(1.) Such as <hi>despise</hi> him instead of honouring
him.</item>
               <item>(2.) Such as pretend to <hi>Honour</hi> him but do
not.</item>
               <item>(3.) Such as give him that real Honour which
is due to him.</item>
            </list>
            <p>(1.) There are such as <hi>despise</hi> him instead of
honouring him. Such as the Sons of <hi>Eli</hi> here
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:101604:6"/>
mention'd, who are said to be <hi>the Sons of Belial,
who knew not the Lord.</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Sam. 2. 12.</note> A strange Character of
such, who had not only the general Advantages
of the People of <hi>Israel</hi> to <hi>know God</hi> above all
Nations of the World; but a particular Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to serve and worship him! But those do
not <hi>know God</hi> who despise his Service. It is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
to <hi>despise</hi> Infinite Goodness and Power
and Wisdom; for those are things, which all
that understand them cannot but Reverence and
highly Esteem. For a poor Creature to despise
his Creatour; or one that lives upon the Bounty
of another to despise his Benefactour; seems to
be such an Inconsistency in Morality, as if hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Nature were uncapable of it. But notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
God himself, who knows the most se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
thoughts of Mens hearts, saith here, <hi>They that
despise me shall be lightly esteemed;</hi> Although God
cannot be despised for his glorious Perfections;
yet his Authority may be despised, when Men
presumptuously break his Laws; when they do
not regard what he hath commanded or forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den;
<hi>When they profess to know God, but in Works
they deny him;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Titus 1. 16.</note> when they own a God, and yet
live as if there were none; giving themselves o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
to a profane and irreligious Temper of Mind,
if not to all sorts of Wickedness in their Lives.
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:101604:6"/>
And if once such a Temper prevails, there is
nothing to be expected but an Inundation of the
other. For those who despise God and Religion
can have little Regard to the Differences of Good
and Evil; and when once the Awe of God and
Conscience is gone, there is nothing can be ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual
enough to restrain the Violence of Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Inclinations.</p>
            <p>There are two sorts of Profane Persons too
easie to be observed in the World. Some are
Profane in their Practises; who give way to
their Sensual Inclinations and pursue them, as
they see Occasion, without Reflection or Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration.
These do not presently shake off the
Principles of Religion and Vertue, although they
Act against them. They know they ought <hi>to Fear
God and to Abstain from Evil;</hi> but they do neither,
leading a loose, dissolute, and wicked Life, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
if they would but consider what they do,
they might soon be convinced of the Folly of their
Actions; because they Act against those <hi>Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples</hi>
which they have seen no Reason to question,
but they have not the Grace and Resolution to
Observe them. While they continue thus, there
is some hold to be taken of them; and although
their Sins be against Conscience, yet they are not
past Hope; because there is some Life left, but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
great Struglings and Decays.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:101604:7"/>
But there are others (I wish I could only say
there had been) who are <hi>Profane</hi> out of <hi>Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples;</hi>
who not only <hi>Neglect</hi> Religion, but <hi>Despise</hi>
it; and <hi>Affront</hi> and <hi>Ridicule</hi> it, as far as they dare
with Regard to their own Safety. The other
are Mischievous to the World by <hi>Example,</hi> but
these by <hi>Design;</hi> Those are Enemies to themselves
and to such as follow them; but these ought to
be look'd on, as the Subverters of all that is
Good, and the Promoters of all Evil and Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief,
and therefore as the truest <hi>Enemies to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,</hi>
and <hi>the Pest and Bane</hi> of Humane Society;
The Dishonour and Reproach of their Age and
Country; And not meerly Enemies to Mankind,
but to God himself, the best and wisest Being in
the World; whom, as far as in them lies, they
endeavour to Dethrone from his Soveraignty
over it. And where such <hi>Monsters</hi> of <hi>Impiety</hi>
grow numerous and bold, they bode the most
fatal Consequences to such a People, where they
appear without a Publick Detestation of them.</p>
            <p>(2.) There are such who pretend to <hi>Honour</hi>
God, but do not. <hi>Honour</hi> is an Act of the Mind,
(if it be spoken of real and inward <hi>Honour,</hi> and
not of the external Signs of it) and it is in Him
that gives, and not in him that receives it. But
yet those who intend to give <hi>Honour</hi> to another,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:101604:7"/>
may do it in such an improper and unsuitable
manner, that He for whom it is intended, may
look on it as an Affront and Dishonour to him.
Therefore he that would give true <hi>Honour</hi> to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
must have a just Apprehension of his
Worth and Excellency, and give it in such a
manner as is most becoming and agreeable to
him.</p>
            <p>Now, there are two ways whereby Men may
be guilty of Dishonouring God under a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of Honouring him.</p>
            <list>
               <item>(1.) By entertaining false Notions of God in
their Minds, and worshipping their own Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations
instead of Him.</item>
               <item>(2.) By doing Honour to him not according
to his Nature and Will, but according to their
own Intentions and Imaginations.</item>
            </list>
            <p>(1.) By false Notions of God in their Minds,
and by worshipping their own Imaginations in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead
of him; <hi>i.e.</hi> when Persons form in their
Minds false Imaginations or Conceptions of Him;
and so give their Worship not to the true God,
but to an Idol of their own Fancy. But there
is a great deal of difference between such Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions
of God in our Minds, which fall short
of the Perfections of the Divine Nature, (as all
ours must do for want of Faculties to compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:101604:8"/>
him) and such which attribute something
to him which is unworthy of him. Not, that if
any happen to be mistaken in their Conceptions
of God, we must presently charge them with
Idolatry; for the Scripture makes that to lie in
an open and publick Dishonouring of God by gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
that Worship which is alone due to him to
any thing besides himself; It is the setting up
of another Interest among Mankind in opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to his Power and Soveraignty; It is such an
Exposing the proper Object of Divine Worship
as to render it mean and contemptible: For
nothing can be a greater Disparagement to the
Divine Nature, than to be supposed to be like
the Work of Mens hands; or to have any of
his own Creatures to have that Worship given
to them which belongs to himself; And so it
takes away the due Apprehension, which ought
to be always maintained of the Infinite Distance
between God and the Workmanship of his Hands.
But these Consequences do not reach to inward
false Conceptions of God; yet they ought by
all possible Means to be avoided by those who
would give unto God in their Minds the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
which is due unto him. And to avoid all
wrong Apprehensions concerning him, we must
settle in our Minds such a fixed Notion of him,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:101604:8"/>
as results from those Evidences which prove his
Being.<note place="margin">Rom. 1. 20.</note> For, <hi>the invisible things of God,</hi> saith the
Apostle, <hi>are understood by the things that are made;
i.e.</hi> the visible frame of the World doth afford
such plain Evidence of the Wisdom, Power and
Goodness of the maker of them, that from thence
we may form a distinct and clear Notion of
God in our Minds, as a Being infinitely Wise,
Powerfull and Good. This is the most natural,
easie and orderly Conception we can have of
God in our minds; because it arises from the
same Arguments which prove his Being. And
when our minds are fixed and settled herein, the
next thing is to exclude all mean and unworthy
thoughts of him, as inconsistent with his Divine
Perfections. Therefore, whatever savours of
Impotency or Cruelty; whatever tends to abate
our Reverence, to lessen our Esteem, to damp
our Affections, or to cool our Devotion to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
him, cannot be agreeable to those just
Conceptions we ought to have always in our
Minds concerning him. For the <hi>Honour</hi> of God
doth not lie in having such terrible Apprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of his Majesty and Power and Justice as
may drive us into Horrour and Despair; but in
entertaining such an Opinion of his Wisdom,
Goodness and Loving-kindness as may incline
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:101604:9"/>
us to Love him and to Trust in his Mercy.
And then God is truely honoured by us, when
we preserve a deep Sense and Awe of him upon
our minds; When we Adore him for his Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
Perfections; When we Esteem him as the
most proper Object of our Love, as well as of
our Fear; When we put our Trust and Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
in him, and depend upon him as to the
Conveniencies of this Life and the Happiness of
another; when <hi>the desire of our Soul is towards
him,</hi> and our Meditation of him is frequent and
serious and delightfull to us; when we <hi>set him
always before us,</hi> and direct the Course of our
Lives and Actions to the Pleasing him; When
we dare not wilfully do any thing to offend him;
but make it our chief study and business to do
what tends to his Honour, and to promote it in
the World.</p>
            <p>It is therefore of very great Consequence, as
to the whole Course of Religion to keep up in
our Minds, such a true and setled Notion of
God, as may influence our Devotion, reform
our Disorders, inflame our Affections, and keep
us from being led aside by the violent and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuous
Heats of Imagination. For this is the
true Source of most of the Extravagancies of
Mankind about Religion; They have no true
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:101604:9"/>
Notion of God in their Minds, but they dread
his Power, and know not how to please him;
and so run from one thing to another, through
the several Methods of Superstitions, or Enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasm,
as agrees best with their Fancies; which
is so unstable and uncertain a Principle, that no
steady Course of Religion can be steer'd by it.
A Man who acts by Imagination, is like a Ship
at Sea without Anchor or Compass, which
Rouls up and down just as the Wind and the
Waves carry her. But Reason and Understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
is a steady and uniform Principle, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
well fixed from a due and thorough Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
of the Nature and Will of God, keeps
the Mind even and constant, and goes on its
Course as well as it can, and makes its way,
notwithstanding the Force of the Current and
Tide of Natural Inclination be against it; and
that the Clouds and Vapors of Imagination of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
hinder the Freedom of its Motion. Nothing
is so uncomfortable, nothing so ungovernable
as a restless Imagination; and when it is oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
with a Religious Melancholy, then every
thing seems dark and confused; we neither
know God nor our selves as we ought to doe,
and we must judge amiss when we judge by
such a false Light: and therefore our wisest
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:101604:10"/>
Course in such a Case is to be Humble and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient;
to suspend any Peremptory Judgment as
to our selves till we have clearer Light, and
those Mists and Vapors are dispersed, which
darken and perplex our Thoughts.</p>
            <p>(2.) Men <hi>dishonour</hi> God, when they pretend
to <hi>honour</hi> him, not according to his Will, but
their own Intentions and Imaginations. There
are some things practised and defended in the
Christian World, which one would hardly
think possible to have ever prevailed, had it not
been that they thought to doe Honour to God
by them. I shall not insist upon the pretences
in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> of <hi>Honouring God</hi> against
his Will, by giving Divine and Religious Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
to Images, Saints and Angels, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> because
though there be a great deal of Folly and Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition
and real Dishonour to God in them, yet
there is no such Mischief to the rest of Mankind,
unless they take up an Imagination that God
will be honoured by rooting out and destroying
all such as cannot comply with them in their
Superstitious Follies. But as the true Spirit of
Religion wears off, that of Persecution often
comes in the place of it, like Wasps and Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets
out of a dead Carkass. Thus in the <hi>Iewish</hi>
Church in our Saviour's time, there was the same
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:101604:10"/>
outward shew and Pomp of Religion, which had
been in their best times; and our Saviour him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
frequented both the Synagogue Worship and
the Solemn Festivals at the Temple;<note place="margin">Luke 4. 16.</note> nay he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd
that the Scribes and Pharisees <hi>sate in Moses's
Chair,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Matt. 23. 2.</note> and that his Disciples should observe what
they taught agreeable to the Law; but yet, he
elsewhere charges them that by their Traditiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Doctrines they had enervated the Force of the
Law;<note place="margin">Matt. 15. 8.</note> and therefore <hi>they did honour him with their
Lips, but their Heart was far from him; i.e.</hi> they
had no true Love of God or their Neighbour,
but they thought to make amends for all that, by
a wonderfull zeal for their own Traditions and
the lesser things of the Law; which they shewed
not only by an unwearied diligence to gain Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selytes,
but by destroying all such as opposed
their Designs; and that not in an ordinary way
of Passion and Revenge, but they would needs
have all this to be done for the Honour and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of God.<note place="margin">John 16. 2.</note> 
               <hi>Whosoever killeth you will think that
he doth God service.</hi> A strange kind of <hi>Service</hi>
indeed, to take away the Lives of his best and
most usefull <hi>Servants!</hi> But although no Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
in the Wold be so directly contrary to all
Acts of Cruelty and Inhumanity as the Christian
is, yet upon the Degeneracy of that, the same
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:101604:11"/>
kind of Spirit hath risen up and prevailed over
too great a part of the Christian World. But
especially the very same Jewish Spirit of Zeal
and Hypocrisy and Cruelty hath enter'd in these
last Ages into a Society of Men (whom I need
not name) who have undermined the genuine
Principles of Morality, inflamed the Spirits of
Princes to all the Effects of a Cruel War and a
Merciless Persecution; and used their utmost
Endeavours to root out all such as dare not sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
their Consciences to the Will of a Prince
under their Direction: and which adds to all
this, they have the Impudence to assume that
Motto to themselves, <hi>Ad majorem Dei Gloriam;</hi>
as though they aimed at nothing but doing greater
Honor to God. Such as these go beyond
<hi>Hophni</hi> and <hi>Phinehas;</hi> for their Wickedness, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
great, was confined to a narrow Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass,
but these disperse themselves into all States
and Kingdoms, and carry on the same uniform
Design, <hi>viz.</hi> to doe all the Mischief they can
under the pretence of Advancing the <hi>Honour</hi> of
God.</p>
            <p>(3.) But certainly there is a Way left to give
to <hi>God</hi> that <hi>Honour</hi> which is due to <hi>Him;</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise,
it were to little purpose to say, <hi>Them
that honour me I will honour.</hi> But I shall not
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:101604:11"/>
take in here all the ways how we may <hi>Honour
God,</hi> but consider that which is most proper to
the Design of these Words. For which we are
to observe that the External Worship and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of God was in general, well enough kept
up and observed in the <hi>Tabernacle</hi> at <hi>Shiloh.</hi>
There the High-Priest attended, the Daily Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices
were offer'd, and the People resorted thither
at the Solemn Feasts from all parts of the Land:
But the great Examples of Wickedness in the Sons
of <hi>Eli</hi> had spread themselves so far, that the
People were generally corrupted, and the best
Part of their Religion, which lies in a <hi>Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
of <hi>Manners,</hi> was almost gone. There were
some Pious and Devout Persons, such as <hi>Eli</hi>
himself (a Good Man but a Bad Magistrate, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Remiss and Careless in the Execution of his
Office) and no doubt, many among the People,
as well as <hi>Elkanah</hi> and <hi>Hannah,</hi> were devout and
serious in the Service of God and other Duties of
Religion; but yet God himself takes notice of
<hi>the Wickedness of his People Israel,</hi> at the time
when the <hi>Ark</hi> was removed from <hi>Shiloh.</hi> And
therefore we have Reason to take particular No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of that Passage to <hi>Eli</hi> concerning the Reason
of the Punishment of his House, <hi>Because his Sons
made themselves vile and he restrained them not.</hi>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:101604:12"/>
For, their Sins were of a very Contagious Nature,
and by <hi>not restraining them,</hi> the People were run
into a great degree of Looseness and Profaneness.
So that it was not for <hi>Eli</hi>'s Personal Miscarriages,
that God thought himself so <hi>dishonoured</hi> by him,
but for want of taking due Care for the Suppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
Profaneness and Corruption of Manners in
others. And this shews the true way how God
may and ought to be <hi>Honoured</hi> by those who
are bound to take Care of others; <hi>viz.</hi> by giving
all due Encouragement to true Religion and
Vertue, and by making use of the most effectual
Means for suppressing Irreligion and Profaneness.</p>
            <p>And this indeed is a Great and Noble Design
fit for the greatest Minds and Persons of the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Station to be Employed about. I cannot
deny, that it is a Difficult Work; for it is easier
to subdue the Bodies than the Passions of Men;
and how many will rather venture their Lives
than mortify their Lusts? And let them pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
what they will, we find that they will soo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
part with any thing than with their Sins. Do
we not daily see that they will let go Honour,
Reputation, Interest, Health, and the hopes of
Heaven, rather than those Vices they have been
accustomed to the Practice of? How can we
then imagine, that the meer Fears of the Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:101604:12"/>
of Humane Laws should presently restrain
those, whom no Fear of Hell or Damnation
could hitherto Reform? But yet a stop may
and ought to be put to the insolent Growth of
Profaneness; for if it be suffered to be too hard
for our Laws, it will in time be too hard for all
sort of Government. Yet how shall a stop be
put to it under such Difficulties? For it cannot
be denied, that we have Excellent Laws against
Vice and Debauchery, and that Magistrates have
had sufficient countenance from Authority for the
due Execution of them. But yet the Complaints
are great of a mighty overflowing of all sorts of
Wickedness still among us; I hope they are not
all true; but yet I am afraid, there is too much
ground for them. What is the Reason of such
a complaint of Profaneness and Irreligion among
us at a time we pretend so much to Reformation?
It is no wonder that the bad Examples of those
who ought to Reform others bring Vice into
Fashion; but when that cannot be alledged,
what is the Reason that good Examples do so
little towards the <hi>Reforming</hi> others? It is easie
to resolve all into the Corruption of Humane
Nature; but that is a General Answer which
serves for all Times and Places, and most suppose
them alike: And if it be a good and sufficient
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:101604:13"/>
Answer, it is to little purpose to talk of <hi>Laws,
Religion</hi> and <hi>Reformation:</hi> For unless they may
have some Power to alter and amend the Course
of mens Actions, they signify very little to the
real Benefit of Mankind, no more than <hi>Sea-marks</hi>
do towards hindring the course of the Tide;
But meer Examples, although of excellent use
to all Ingenuous Minds, yet to others they are
but like <hi>Statues</hi> of <hi>Mercury</hi> in the Road, which
point to the right way, but men will go which
way they please notwithstanding.</p>
            <p>Therefore to <hi>Laws</hi> and <hi>Examples</hi> the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates
<hi>Power</hi> must be added, which was appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
for this purpose,<note place="margin">Rom. 13. 3.</note> to be <hi>a Terrour to those that
do evil,</hi> as well as an Encouragement to those that
do well. And then the Apostle supposeth <hi>the
Sword is born in vain,</hi>
               <note place="margin">ver. 4.</note> when the Magistrate is
not <hi>the Minister of God</hi> in this respect; <hi>a Revenger
to execute Wrath upon him that doeth evil.</hi> It was
the Great and Just Honour of Princes of old,
that by their means, Mankind was reduced from
a rude and disorderly kind of life, to the Practice
of Civility and Good Manners; and it is as
great a Foundation of Honour still, when Men
are so much Apostatized from them, to bring
them back again to the due Order and Decency
of Living. The Case is much harder of those
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:101604:13"/>
who are Degenerate under Laws, than of those
who were so without them; For they have
learnt to despise their Remedy, and by Arts and
Subtilties to avoid the Force of that, which was
intended for their Good.</p>
            <p>But, however, none ought to be discouraged
from so Excellent a Design; which Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends
it self to all Wise and Good Men, and
will never want the Assistance and Prayers of
all that are so; and God himself will in an espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
Manner give <hi>Honour</hi> to Those who thus
<hi>Honour</hi> him in his own Way; by using the most
<hi>Effectual</hi> Means for the Reforming the Manners
of Men.</p>
            <p>But what are those ways which may be called
<hi>Effectual?</hi> It's true, that depends upon the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
and Blessing of God; but it is no hard
Matter for us to judge what are the most likely
Means to be <hi>Effectual.</hi> Such as,</p>
            <p>(1.) An Universal Discountenancing of all
sorts of Vice and Profaneness, be the Persons
of what Rank or Quality soever. For, if those
of the <hi>House</hi> of <hi>Eli</hi> be suffer'd to transgress, the
People will follow their Examples; although
the Good old Man did not like their Doings,
but he did not take Care enough to <hi>Restrain</hi>
them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:101604:14"/>
(2.) An Even, Steady, Vigorous and Impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
Execution of the Laws against Looseness
and Debauchery; so that it may not look like
a sudden Heat or Design of Popularity, but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
from a due and well-temper'd Zeal for
God and Religion.</p>
            <p>(3.) A Wise Choice of fit Instruments to
pursue so Good an End; I mean such as <hi>Iethro</hi>
recommended to <hi>Moses, Men of Courage and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Exod. 18. 21.</note>
               <hi>Fearing God and hating Covetousness.</hi> And
such I hope are to be found in the several Parts
of the Nation.</p>
            <p>(4.) Lastly, A diligent Inspection into the
Behaviour of those who are the proper and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
Instruments for carrying on so good a
Design. For, if there be no Inspection after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
it will be look'd on as a meer matter of
Form, or an Order given out to satisfie the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities
of some and the Clamours of others.
It were to be wished, that all who are Imploy'd
in such a Work had an Equal Mixture of <hi>Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi>
and <hi>Zeal;</hi> but it is not possible to hinder
some from having unequal shares of these; And
it is great Pity so Good a Cause should Miscarry
through the Indiscretion of any who are Zealous
for it. On the other side, It is possible that
some who pretend to an Equal Zeal for it in
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:101604:14"/>
general, may Use such Artifices and Fair Preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
as may effectually baffle and undermine it,
while they seem to be concerned to promote it.
So that, what through the Intemperate Heats of
some, the Coldness and Indifferency of others,
and the certain Averseness all bad Men have to
any real Design of <hi>Reformation,</hi> there is a Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
for such an Affair to be often look'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
and an Account taken of the Management
of it, if any great Advantage be expected by
it.</p>
            <p>And surely no greater Advantage can be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
as to this World, than from such a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
managed, as it ought to be. For, what
can we propose to our Selves, that can tend
more to promote the <hi>Honour</hi> of <hi>Almighty God,</hi>
which we ought above all other things to be
concerned for. For, <hi>the Righteous God loveth
Righteousness;</hi> and <hi>he abhorrs all kind of Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness:</hi>
What then can be more Pleasing to him,
than to have all sorts of Impiety and Profane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
discountenanced, punished, and if it be pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible,
rooted out? What can tend more to the
<hi>Honour</hi> of his <hi>Vicegerents,</hi> than to shew so much
of a Resemblance to Him, as to Love what
God loves, and to hate what he hates; and to
imploy their Power for the same End which God
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:101604:15"/>
himself doth his, <hi>viz.</hi> to Advance his Glory and
to do Good to Mankind? What can tend more
to the <hi>Honour</hi> of our <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>Nation,</hi> than to
let the World see by such Good Works as these,
what the <hi>Reformation</hi> is, which we aim at; Not
meerly of some disputable Points, as to Doctrine
and Practise, (which we have earnestly conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
for, and with great Reason,) but a true and
serious <hi>Reformation</hi> of the Hearts and Lives of
Men; without which all our other Pretences will
fall infinitely short of what God expects from us,
and the very Name of <hi>Reformation</hi> will be a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
to us.</p>
            <p>II. I now proceed to the second Particular,
<hi>viz.</hi> the Rules and Measures which God observes
in distributing Honour among Men, <hi>Them that
honour me, I will honour; but they that despise me
shall be lightly esteemed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Which may be understood two ways;</p>
            <list>
               <item>I. As to the Societies of Men which have one
Common Interest.</item>
               <item>II. As to the Interests and Honour of Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Persons.</item>
            </list>
            <p>I. As to such Societies of Men, which have
one Common Interest. And so it implies, that
the Welfare and Reputation, and flourishing
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:101604:15"/>
Condition of such, depends upon their Zeal
and Concernment for God and Religion. But
here, we meet with very great Difficulties; for
<hi>Reason</hi> and <hi>Experience</hi> seem to contradict each
other about it. On the one side, it seems most
agreeable to the Justice of Divine Providence to
Reward and Punish those in this World who will
not be Capable of being rewarded or punished
in another; for there will be no Communities
in another World. But on the other side, we
cannot deny matter of common Experience;
for, how long have the <hi>Turkish and Papal Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chies</hi>
(to name no other) flourished, when the
<hi>seven Churches</hi> of <hi>Asia,</hi> and the <hi>Churches</hi> of <hi>Africa</hi>
have been long since destroyed? How strangely
hath <hi>Mahometism</hi> spread in the <hi>Eastern</hi> Parts of
the World? And what a Check hath there been,
upon the <hi>Reformation</hi> in these <hi>Western</hi> Parts?
With what a mighty Torrent did it prevail at
first? Then it stood at a stand, and hath of
late years gone so much backward, and suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd
so very much in many Parts of it: And
yet we think, and that very justly, that the <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of God</hi> is concerned in all this. What shall
we say to the Insolent Oppressors of Mankind
who make no Conscience of ruining Cities and
Countries, and offering Violence to the Bodies
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:101604:16"/>
and Consciences of Men to Advance and Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
their own Grandeur; and yet have been
suffer'd to prevail so far as to be made an Ar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gument
against Providence by Atheistical Men?
It is to be hoped that God in his own time will
vindicate his <hi>Honour</hi> and clear this point to the
Satisfaction of all reasonable Men; but yet, we
cannot penetrate into the Wisdom and Secrets
of Providence. God will (no doubt) take Care
of his own <hi>Honour;</hi> but he is not bound to give
such men an Account of the Ways and Methods
and Seasons of his doing it. He often raises up
a Nation fit for his purpose, and makes them as
a Scourge to Neighbour Nations; and when
they have done his Work, he suffers them to be
humbled, if not destroyed, by the same Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods
they have used to others. Sometimes he
raises up one Kingdom and Nation against ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
when their Sins make them ripe for Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance;
and so he takes the Potsheards of the
Earth and breaks them upon one another; and
thus, by their mutual Punishment, they both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
the Executioners of his Wrath; and we
cannot determine by the Event which was in the
greater Guilt. So that God takes Care of his
own <hi>Honour,</hi> by Methods we are not able to
comprehend. For who can weigh the Nations
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:101604:16"/>
in a Balance, and determine how far the Sins of
one doth exceed the other? And if we cannot
know the Number and Aggravation of a Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
Sins, we can never fix the Measures and
Degrees of their Punishments.</p>
            <p>But, however, some things are certain;</p>
            <p>(1.) That the Sins of a Nation do naturally
tend to the Weakness and Dishonour of it.
Thus a factious, seditious, turbulent Temper not
only is the Reproach of a People; but the ready
way to destroy it. And yet it hath so happen'd,
that when the Factions have been almost equally
poised, as at <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Carthage,</hi> they have raised
such an Emulation between them, which by
their endeavours to out-vie each other, hath for
some time preserved their Countrey. Who can
deny that Luxury and Debauchery and all sorts
of Intemperance, not only sink the Reputation
of a People, but effeminates and softens them,
and makes them Careless and Idle, Regardless
of any thing but what makes for their own Ease
and Voluptuousness? And in all human proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility,
such a Nation must sink, when a People
of more Wisdom and Courage and Resolution,
makes it their business to overcome them. So
that these sorts of Sins are <hi>Natural Causes</hi> of
weakning the Power and Interest of a Nation.
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:101604:17"/>
But there are other Sins, as Profaneness and
Contempt of God and Religion, Hypocrisy,
Idolatry, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and of such, which work as <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Causes,</hi> God himself is the only Judge,
when the Measure of their Iniquity is filled
up.</p>
            <p>(2.) Sometimes God steps out of his ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Method and Course of Providence either
in a way of Judgment or Mercy. And then
he more particularly shews, that <hi>those that Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
him, he will honour; and those who despise
him shall be lightly esteemed.</hi> These things are
not every days Experience, but when they do
happen they deserve to be taken notice of, in
a more than ordinary Manner.<note place="margin">Eudem. l. 7. c. 14.</note> 
               <hi>Aristotle,</hi> who
was no great Friend to Providence, as to Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Affairs, professes, that he did not know
what to make of <hi>the extraordinary Success some
Persons had in their Affairs, without any extraordinary
visible Causes.</hi> It is possible, he might have the
Success of his <hi>Macedonian Friends</hi> in his thoughts;
who swallow'd up the <hi>Common-wealths</hi> of <hi>Greece,</hi>
as so many Morsels, and then destroy'd the
mighty <hi>Persian Monarchy.</hi> But in these Cases,
he allows a <hi>Divine Impulse,</hi> carrying them on
beyond the ordinary Measures of human Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence;
and over-ruling so many things in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:101604:17"/>
to Success, as nothing but a Divine Hand
could manage. And when great Advantages
come to a Nation in such a manner, a more
than ordinary Degree of Thankfulness is justly
expected, that God may be <hi>honoured</hi> in a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
manner for the Deliverance he works by
such Means, and the Mercies he bestows or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues
thereby.</p>
            <p>(2.) As to particular Persons; how far this
holds, will appear by these things:</p>
            <p>(1.) That Esteem and Honour naturally fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
the Opinion of anothers Desert or Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency.
For it is not an Arbitrary thing, but
is founded on the Supposition of something that
deserves it. It is like the Assent given to Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematical
Evidence, which is not because they
will do it, but because they cannot help it.</p>
            <p>(2.) The Sincere Practise of Piety and Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
doth command Esteem and Reverence.
Hypocrisy indeed lessens it to the utmost de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree;
because it argues a mean and false Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
of Mind; but there is nothing in true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
but what tends to raise Esteem; For it
implies all the things which are allow'd by all
Persons to gain <hi>Honour</hi> among Men. For one
that is truely Religious is a true Lover of God
and of Mankind; He is gratefull to his Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factour,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:101604:18"/>
and always owns in the most solemn
manner his Dependence upon him, both by
Prayers and Praises; He is ready to doe Good
to all men, as far as is consistent with his Duty
to God; He is just, righteous, and mercifull,
sober and temperate in the whole Course of his
Life; He acts not by Chance or for by Ends;
but by a fixed Principle of being and doing
Good; He keeps himself within the Bounds
which God hath set him; and with Chearfulness
and Resolution sets himself to doe and suffer his
Will; and hath so much Courage, as to dare
to doe his Duty, and is afraid of nothing so
much as Offending God. And now let any one
judge, whether there be any thing Mean or
Contemptible in all this; whether every one
that hears this Character doth not wish it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed
to himself. And that is a certain token
that it brings Honour and Esteem with it.</p>
            <p>Let me then, for a Conclusion of all, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend
the Practise of <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Vertue</hi> to
all such as are the most concerned for <hi>Honour</hi>
and <hi>Esteem.</hi> The World is always vain enough
to flatter Greatness, either out of Weakness or
Design; but true Greatness of Mind despises
Flattery; and where that is wanting in any,
this very Flatterer despises them. But this is
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:101604:18"/>
a Way to be above the reach of Contempt;
<hi>To doe Iustly,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Micah 6. 8.</note> 
               <hi>and to love Mercy, and to walk hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
with God;</hi> and these are the things which
God himself assures us are the main Parts of our
Duty. If we be Careless of God's Honour and
Service now, the time will shortly come, when
we shall heartily wish we had been otherwise.
For, how great soever your <hi>Honour</hi> be now,
you and that together must in a little time be
<hi>laid in the Dust.</hi> And then the main Difference
will be according to the <hi>Honour</hi> we have done
to God; For, although the Text doth hold
good, as to this World, as I have already
shew'd; yet the most glorious Accomplishment
of it will be in the Life to come: For, then it
will be made Evident to all Mankind, that
<hi>Those that honour him, God will honour; and they
that despise him shall be lightly esteemed.</hi>
