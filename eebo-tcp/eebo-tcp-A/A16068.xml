         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

health. In all theſe thinges are certaine ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crete
vertues, whiche be manifeſte ſignes of
goddes loue and fauoure towardes man: for
he created them to thintent that men ſhould
vſe them, glorifie him, and geue him thankes
for them. And becauſe the vſe and knowledge
of them, and their vertues, is ſo expedient for
al creatures, God of his mere goodnes, hath
not onely geuen vnto the diligent ſearchers
therof, the gifte of perfitte vſage, and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandinge
of their operation in this time of
Chriſtianitie: but alſo vnto infideles before
Chriſt, beynge ignoraunt from whence that
gyfte came: who, notwithſtanding their ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noraunce,
did ſo reuerence the wonderful ver<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tues
of thinges created in the worlde, that
they thought that eche of thoſe thinges had
had in it ſelfe a certaine diuine power, or els
that there was of euery thinge a ſeueral god
or creatour. Now, if they gaue ſuche honoure
vnto thinges created, not knowinge the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atoure,
what woulde they haue doen, if they
had knowen and confeſſed God to haue bene
the onely maker of the worlde, of man, and of
all thinges therin, of nothinge? Trulye they
woulde not haue done as ſome curious Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
amonge vs nowe a dayes do, whiche
(as your honour well vnderſtandeth) moſte
impudentlye deſpiſe all maner of medecines,
and ignorauntly diſpute againſt the vertues
and operation of herbes, and trees, ſayinge:
<pb facs="tcp:4590:2"/>
that if the ſicke man be appointed of God to
dye, all the medecines in the worlde can not
ſaue his life. Whervnto it may eaſely be aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered,
that euery man that is vexed with a
diſeaſe, is not appointed of God to die of the
ſame: but the infirmitie is ſent him as a pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment
for his offences, and yet hath God
created thinges to geue him eaſe and remedy
for his diſeaſe, which no Chriſte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> man ought
to contempne or deſpiſe: for he that deſpiſeth
the worke, ſeemeth to contempne the worke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.
And agayne, becauſe that the appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and determination of God, concerning
the life and death of man, is ſo ſecrete, and ſo
farre beyonde the capacitie of mans reaſon,
and vnderſtandinge, and that we know not
when God hath prefixed the terme of our life,
we vſe in our infirmities and weaknes, thoſe
remedies that God hath created to be recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
at their handes, to whome he hath geuen
the knowledge howe to miniſter theim vnto
vs. All theſe thinges are abundantly ynough
knowen vnto your honour, with a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
more reaſons then I am able to alledge,
and therfore I do but bring owles to Athens
in declaringe this vnto you. But thus much
I may well ſaye, that mooſt madde are they,
and voyde of all reaſon &amp; Chriſtianitie, that
wyle ſet ſo light by the workes of God: yea,
they are vnprofitable members of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
welth, not worthy to bear the name of
<pb facs="tcp:4590:3"/>
Chriſtians: for by their fonde and falſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſions
to the ignoraunte and ſimple ones
in their diſeaſes, againſt the receiuing of any
medicines, many times it chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceth, that thei
folowynge their fooliſhe aduiſe in neglectyng
Phiſick, thei be caſt away and periſhe, whiche
otherwiſe might haue bene ſaued. Me thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
this ſhould be ſufficient to perſwade the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
to embrace good and holeſome remedies: thei
ſee daylie that herbes, oinctmentes, plaiſters
made of thinges growing on the earth, and
ſuche like, by their vertues, do cure and heale
externall and outwarde woundes, ſores, cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,
ſwellinges, and other infirmities of the
body, and yet they will not beleue that ſuche
vertues can heale the internall and inwarde
diſeaſes. Vtterly ignoraunte be thei, that ſo
imagine with them ſelues, for thei that deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſe
Phiſick, deſpiſe a heauenly ſcience. But
what be thei that thus contempne it? For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoth
ignoraunt &amp; vnlearned men, that barke
at, and backbite theim that take paines for
the commoditie of all men. But it is comonly
ſeene and proued. <hi>Scientia non habet ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micum
praeter ignorantem.</hi> Whiche ſaiynge
(I feare me) is verified more in ſome of vs
Engliſhe men, than in anye other nation, I
woulde God it were not. And yet I thincke
there is no man ſo beſtiall, ſo rude, or ſo blunt
of wit, but that he is (by a certaine inſtinct of
natural inclinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) deſirous to know things
<pb facs="tcp:4590:3"/>
not before knowen, to heare newes not before
heard, and to vnderſtand bokes in his mater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
tonge, written firſt in a forein langage,
to thende not to ſeme altogether ignoraunte
in matters both of the liberall ſciences, and
alſo of hiſtories, ſet forth for his rudiment and
inſtruction, as in <hi>Coſmographie, in Aſtrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie,

and ſpecially in Phiſick, whereof we had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
ſo muche neede as in theſe our daies, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering
the ſtraunge and vnknowen diſeaſes
that ſwarme amonge vs, and mo in number
then can be found remedy for. Therefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering
with my ſelf (right honorable) that
I could not better declare my bounden duetie
vnto you, nor do my countrey a greater plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
than to put ſome thinge abroade vnder
youre honoures name, whereby it mighte re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
ſome commodite: I haue taken in hand
to tranſlate this noble and excellent woorke
called, <hi>The Secretes of the Reueuerende Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,
Alexis of Piemount,</hi> firſte written in the
Italian toungue, and after tourned into
Frenche, and of late into Dutche, and nowe
laſte of al into Engliſh, becauſe that as well
Engliſhe men, as Italians, Frenche menne,
or Dutchmen, may ſucke knowlege and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
hereof: beyng a work come out of the han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ds
of ſo famous a man as <hi>Alexis</hi> is, and dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
fyrſte to ſuche a noble prince as the duke of
Sauoye is, to whome trifles or fables are
<pb facs="tcp:4590:4"/>
not to be preſented, nor beinge a man vnder
whoſe name and protection lies or vayne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentions
oughte to be ſette forth. Therefore
wayinge the age, the learninge and fame of
the auctor, &amp; the nobilitie of the ſaied Prince,
men may eaſely iudge that ſuche intollera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
paynes haue not bene taken in the colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of theſe ſecretes, to blowe an vntrueth
into mennes eares, but rather that this boke
hath ben publiſhed and communicated to the
worlde by the ſaied <hi>Alexis,</hi> for the care and
good zeale that he had to the health of mens
bodies, and that men of all countreys might
haue the knowledge of that with eaſe, ſitting
at home in their ſtudies, whiche he got with
greate trauayle and laboure, wandering al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſte
al the world ouer, as in his epiſtle here
to the reader he declareth.</p>
            <p>And nowe (right honourable) like as Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtopher
Plantine of Antwarpe, the printer of
this worke in Frenche, choſe the Prince of
Piemount, to protecte and adourne the frui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes

this my tranſlation vnto you, and to putte it
forth vnder your honours name and protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
deſiring, and humbly requiring the ſame,
to accept my poore good wyll, hauinge good
hope that you ſhall finde ſuche thinges in the

diſcourſe of the whole booke, that you will

them: but alſo commoditie, if it pleaſe you to

wonderfull giftes of God in men, whiche ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordyng
to their talent, impart to the worlde
the encreaſe and fruicte of ſoche giftes, as he
diſtributeth vnto them. Of the whiche giftes
I thinke I ſhould not moche erre, if I ſaied

hauinge by a natural inclination, taken a ſinguler plea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſure
in Philoſophy, and in the ſecretes of nature, haue
wandered and trauailed abroad in the worlde the ſpace
of .xxvii. yeares, to the intent to acquainte my ſelf with
all ſortes of learned and diſcrete men. By the which di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence

               </gap>led almoſt all other partes of the world, without
reſting or ſeiourning at any time in one place aboue .v.
moneths. Now this my ſtudy and deſire of knowledge,
as well of the vniuerſall ſciences, as of particuler ſecre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,
and althoughe it was geuen vnto me by nature, as
to the moſt part of men (for euery man by an inſtincte of
nature deſyreth to knowe thinges) yet haue I alwayes
<pb facs="tcp:4590:6"/>
been noſeled vp by a certain ambition and vainglorie,
to knowe that, whiche an other ſhould bee ignoraunte
of: whiche thyng hath grafted in me, a continuall nig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardneſſe
or ſparing, to diſtribute or communicate any
of my ſecretes, yea vnto my moſte ſinguler frendes that
I had: ſaiyng, that if the ſecretes were knowen of eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
man, thei ſhould no more bee called ſecretes, but pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blike
and common.</p>
            <p>Now, it chaunced theſe fewe daies paſt, being in Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan:
in the fowerſkore and twoo yere, and ſeuen mone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thes
of myne age, that a poore artificer was maruelou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſly
tourmented with the ſtone, and had been twoo daies
without making his vrine. The Cyrurgen that dreſſed
hym, knowyng well that I had many ſecretes, and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulerly
for the ſtone, came to me, and requeſted me that
I would teache hym the receipte, or at the leaſt to giue
hym the medecine, compoſed and ready made, for the
health of the patiente. But I perceiuyng that he would
vſe other mennes thinges, for his owne profite and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
refuſed to giue it hym, but willed hym to bryng
me vnto the ſicke man, and that I my ſelf would mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
the medecine vnto him <hi>gratis.</hi> The Phiſition, either
fearyng blame if it ſhould bee knowen, that he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
to the aide of an other man, hauyng peraduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
boſted that he had the ſecrete hymſelf, or els in the
meane tyme, ſtill to make his profite in diſſembling the
matter, and differryng it yet twoo daies more, with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe
excuſes and colours, vntill he brought me to the
patiente, whom at my commyng I founde ſo nigh his
ende, that after he had a little lifted vp his iyes, caſtyng
them pitiouſly towarde me, he paſſed from this into a
better life: not hauyng any neede, neither of my ſecrete
nor any other receipt to recouer his health. With this
cace I was moued to ſoche a compaſſion and ſorowe,
that not onely I wiſſhed my ſelf euill, but alſo I deſired
to die: ſeyng my ambition and vain glorie, to haue been
the cauſe that this poore man was not ſuccoured with
the remedy, and gifte that God the father, and Lorde of
<pb facs="tcp:4590:6"/>
vs all had giuen me. Wherefore, ſo greate was the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morſe
of conſcience in me, that, deſiryng to ſequeſtrate
my ſelf fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the worlde, and not findyng my ſelf of ſoche
a diſpoſition of mynde, that I could liue in a Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie
emong religious menne, better edified then I, I
was at the laſte fully reſolued with my ſelf, to chooſe a
place ſeparate from any Toune, where I haue a little
lande, ſome bookes, and a ſtudie, for to auoide idlenes.
Here I liue a life, whiche I call a Monkes life, with one
ſeruaunte, whiche goeth to the toune, not to begge, but
to buie my prouiſion, and other thynges neceſſarie: for
to ſuſtaine his poore life and myne, as long as it ſhall
pleaſe God.</p>
            <p>But yet not hauyng the power to put out of my fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſie,
but that I was a verie homicide and murtherer,
for refuſing to giue the Phiſition the receipt and reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die,
for the healyng of this poore manne, I haue deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
to publiſhe and communicate to the worlde, all
that I haue, beyng aſſured that fewe other menne haue
ſo many as I. And mindyng to ſet forth none, but ſoche
as bee moſte true and proued, I haue theſe daies paſte
(taken partly out of my Bookes, and partly out of my
memorie, all thoſe that came to hand) made a collection
of ſoche as I am certaine bee veritable, true, and er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimented,
not caryng if ſome of theim be written, or
printed in any other Bookes then this. For of this my
collection the reader, as touchyng thoſe, maie at the
leaſt take this vtilitee and profite, that whereas before
he mought haue doubted, whether ſoche remedies ſette
foorthe by an other manne, were true or not, he ſhall
bee now aſſured, vnder the affirmaunce of my faithe:
For truely, I would not ſette my ſelfe (beeyng in the
age, and diſpoſition, bothe of bodie and mynde, that
I am nowe in) to write fables or lies, that ſhould
continue alwaies. But of one poyncte I wille ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertiſe
the reader, and that is, that he dooe the thyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
with good diligence, and that in medecines concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nynge
<pb facs="tcp:4590:7"/>
mannes body, he vſe the ayde and helpe of phiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions:
Although in dede many of theim, moued with a
certaine ruſtick, and euyll grounded enuie, with a paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Ialouſy, are wont to blame and contempne thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
that come not of them ſelues. Wherefore, as wel in
this, as in euerye other pointe, if he that will vſe theſe,
ſhould perchaunce finde, that the thing would not take
effecte according to his contentation, lette him beware
that he abuſe not him ſelf in the confection of them, and
to beginne againe with more diligence. Aſſuringe him
ſelfe, that (as I haue ſayd) there is nothing in this boke
but is true and experimented. And geuing alwayes
glory and praiſe vnto god onely for all, haue a
good hope, that, by meane of his diuine
grace, I will conſequentlye make you
a preſent of the reſt of all that I
haue gotten in ſo manye
trauayles, voyages,

to paſſe theim through the ſaied Balneum Marie, at ſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry

You ſhall ſet and trimme the violles with ſtrawe

there muſt be water, and ſet the ſaied caudron vpon a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naiſe

                  <p>Now the maner how to vſe it, is this: In the Spryng
time, ye maie take it alone, or with a little broth of Veale,
Pigeons or Chickens, or els in Maluoiſie, or ſome other
good white wine. In Sommer, ye muſt take it with wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of Bugloſe, or the decoctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Borrage, Bugloſe, Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſe,
Succorie, Endiue, or els ſome of the ſaid herbes: and
at all tymes it is good to take of it a ſponefull, putte into
halfe a glaſſe ful of the milke of a woman, new brought a
bed of a man child, or of a nurrice that giueth a man child
ſucke, or els in Gotes milke. And the quantitie &amp; oft vſing
of it muſt be obſerued, accordyng to the perſones, &amp; tyme:
for, vnto a weke and aged man and thoſe that haue been
lately ſicke, or weake of nature, ye muſte giue it oftener,
and a greater qua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>titie, then vnto a yong and luſtie man.
Alſo a man maie take of it oftener, and more in Winter,
then in Sommer. Now ye muſt vnderſtande, that all the
flowers, herbes, and other thinges reherſed, are not fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d

can not be made at one tyme, but beginnyng the firſte or
ſeconde weeke of Maie, it ſhall be at the leaſt, the ende of
September or October, before ye can make an ende: and
therefore you muſt gather from tyme to tyme, eche thing

accordyng to the tyme that you maie get them in. And yet
if you can not furniſhe your ſelf, with al ſoche thinges as
I haue declared, take thoſe that you can gette, prouided,
that the reſte whiche you can not get, bee not of to greate
importaunce: but it ſhould be more expedient and ſure, to

<pb n="18" facs="tcp:4590:24"/>
ſeene the experience of it in a Frier of S. Onofrey,
that is to ſaie: of them that weare anhabit of Roan co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour:
but (as he ſaied) he dwelt not in the monaſterie,
becauſe of the ſaid infirmitie of his lefte arme, whiche
was as drie as the braunche of a withered tree. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer,
he ſaied vnto me, that he did not remember nor
coulde tell whether that chaunced vnto him, either by
ſickneſſe, or by ſome wounde or hurte. The ſaide arme
was become ſmaller then the other almoſte by halfe, ſo
that the ſaide arme had almoſte no ſtrength at all, and
coulde not helpe it ſelfe in no wiſe. I cauſed him then
to bee annointed with the ſaide oyle (whiche I had ſet
in the Sonne the Somer of the yeare 1547.) by the
ſpace of .ij. <hi>miſerere,</hi> &amp; made him tarie in the Sonne vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till
the ſaied oyle was cleane dryed vp, and had perced
thorowe the ſaied arme: and within .lv. daies, men did
perceyue and ſee perfitelye that the veynes gaue nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment
vnto the membre. Nine daies after, the arme
was as full of fleſhe as the other: and with the helpe of
god, was as whole and ſound, as though it had neuer
been hurte. This ſaide oyntment or oyle is a precious
thing, and good for al colde infirmities, &amp; for the gout:
and ſpeciallye for all contractions or ſhrinkinges toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of ſynowes or membres, and woundes, albeit, the
man were wounded in the middes of the bodie, in put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
into it this oyle, ſhal a miraculous thing beſeene:
and it is alſo good for the ſinowes. As I came from Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem
in the yere 1518. in a ſhippe, of the whiche the
maiſter was called Peter de <hi>Chioggia,</hi> we were ſet vpon
by fiue foyſtes of Pirates, on this ſide <hi>Corphu,</hi> and one
of the Mariners ſo attainted with the ſtroke of a gonne
that he had his arme bruſed and broken, and with the
ſame blowe another hurt in the breſt. The Phiſition
would haue cut of the arme. But among other things
that I caried about with me, I found a bore of the ſaid
oyntment, wherwith I anoynted his arme, and in the
ſpace of ſixe or ſeuen days, he was healed miraculouſly.
I haue made many experiences, aſwel vpon myſelf, as
<pb facs="tcp:4590:25"/>
vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> others: and hauing giuen of it vnto diuers men to
ayde them ſelues withall, they haue tolde me that they
haue fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d in it a meruelous vertue &amp; operation. If you
make this oyle in the time when the herbe of S. Ihons
wort is found, ye ſhal putte in the herbe, the bloſſome,
and the ſeede: but if it be in the time when it can not be
fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, after ye haue made the firſt decoctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the dog, as
we haue ſaid, ye ſhal boyle the oyle &amp; the greaſe once a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
putting to it the oyle of S. Ihons wort, whereof
we haue ſpoken afore, or as ye may get it: that is to ſai,
halfe aſmuch as al the oyle and greaſe is. And if ye can
not find <hi>biſmalua</hi> or wild mallowes, ye may put in ſtede
of it, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> oyntment called <hi>Dialtea,</hi> which is found co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
at the Apoticaries. And when ye wil boyle the dog in
the kettle, it ſhalbe good to put to it, thre torteſes that
liue on the lande and not on the water, and ſo ſhall the
ſaid oyntment be very excellent for the goute. A certein
man of mine acquaintaunce, of the age of thirtie yeres,
vexed with the gout, whome I made take of this oyle,
and anoynt himſelf a litle in the place of the griefe, and
about it, putting to it two partes of oyle roſat, one part
of oyle violet, &amp; two partes of the ſaid oyle of the dogge,
told me that he had found a merueylous eaſe and helpe
by it. And the ſaid griefe returning againe foure times
at ſondrie times, yet anoyntinge himſelfe therewith
thre times (as is aforeſayde) the paine came vnto hym
no moore in the ſpace of three yeares that wee were in

it diligentlye as a precious thinge: for it hath many no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
and excellent vertues, of the whiche the beſt bee
theſe that folowe. The firſt is, that if you laye a lytle of
it vpon a freſhe wounde, there neede no other medicine
to cure it. The ſeconde is, it is good for al old woundes,
againſt the Canker, the wormes, and againſt <hi>Nolime

the ſoore places with it euerie ſeconde or thirde daye
once, and by thys meanes, in the ſpace of fyftene
or twentie daies, he or thei ſhalbe healed. The thirde
is, that if anye manne haue a Carbuncle, or Saynct
Antonies diſeaſe, called commonlye in Italye and in
Fraunce, S. Antonies fier, or other peſtilenciall ſycke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
and waſhe the place with the ſaied water, will it
kil it within an houre. The fourth is, it is good againſt
the paine of the eyes, ſo that the eye bee not out, or loſt:
if you putte a litle droppe of it into the eye in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninge,
and as muche at nighte, it will heale the paine
in fiftene daies. And althoughe it bee ſomewhat pric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kyng,
yet the griefe of it paſſeth ſoone away, ſo that it
can not in any wiſe hurte the eyes. The fifte is, that
if any man haue the ſtone in the raines of his backe,
and in the bladder, &amp; drinke three droppes or a dragme
of it with a litle white wine, he ſhalbe delyuered therof
in few daies. The ſixte is, that it healeth the Emerau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des
or Pyles, if they bee waſhed with it euerye daye
once. The ſeuenth is, that it healeth all maner of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:4590:35"/>
or pain of the Matrice &amp; the colick, when a ſponeful
is dronke of it with the broth of a henne, or of cabbeges.
The eyght is, that when a man batheth the ſhronken
and endured ſynowes of the bodie, they ſtretche, and
heale in fewe daies. The nynth is, that it healeth run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng
and watrie eyes, when a droppe is put into them
in the morning. The tenth is, that it is verie good to
heale all maner of ſkabbe, ſkurfe, and other like thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
waſhing them with it often times. The eleuenth
is, that if a man put a droppe of it into his eare at night
or in the morninge, it taketh awaie all the griefe and
wormes that engender in the eare. The twelfth is,
that it healeth all venemous bitinge, when ye waſhe
the venemous place with it, and is farre better for ſuch
an accident then the triacle is. The thirtenth is, that
it killeth all wormes in mannes bodie, if a man rubbe
his noſeſtrelles, or drinke a verie litle of it. And final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie,
it is alſo verie good for venemous hurtes or woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,

                  <p>FYrſt here is to be noted a goodly and notable ſecrete
of great vertue, for to ſcoure and make white teeth,
whiche is the pommeiſe ſtone alone, ſo that it be of that
fyne and whyte ſtone, whiche ſhoemakers doo vſe to
whiten whyte leather Shoes, and well beaten in poul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der:
For in rubbinge youre teeth with the ſame poul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
if ſcoureth and maketh them cleane, and taketh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
all the roughneſſe of theim, as men ſee by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
that the pommeiſe ſtone is vſed to polyſſhe bones,
marble, and other like thinges. I haue ſene of my fren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,
men of great iudgement and knowledge, whiche
gaue nothinge vnto greate men and Lordes, but the
<pb facs="tcp:4590:83"/>
ſayd poulder, whan it is well beaten in poulder, a man
can not tell what it is: alſo you may geue it a little ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour,
layinge it amonge bagges of Muſke and Amber,
of whome it taketh an odour, and I haue ſeene men of
eſtimation, that helde it for a thinge of greate impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taunce,
when they ſawe the vertue and operation of it.
Nowe, if you will make a white poulder, more noble
and more profitable for the teeth, and gommes, take
ſmall pearles ſtamped a lytle, or elles whole, and putte
them in a dyſhe, or in a wyde glaſſe: than take the iuyce
of lemons or orenges, ſtrayned thorough a linen cloth,
at the leaſte ſixe or ſeuen times, and poure it vppon the
ſaied Pearles, vntill it couer them ouer three or foure
fingers high, and you ſhal ſee that in ſhorte ſpace it wil
beginne to boyle, and than couer it with ſome paper, or
linnen cloth, leauinge it ſo three or foure dayes, and at
the ende you ſhall finde the ſayed pearles diſſolued and
molten in the iayde iuyce, and tourned into a paſte as
white as ſnowe, marye there will be a little yellowe
ſkinne vppon it, engendred of the ſayed ſuyce. This
doen, take cleere well water, or the water of <hi>Lentiſcus</hi>
diſtilled, and poure it vpon the ſayed paſte, three or four
fingers heighte aboue. Than take a little forke, or the
ſteale of a ſyluer ſpone, or ſome thinne ſticke, and ſtyre
the paſte well aboute in the ſayed water, lettinge it ſo
ſtande, and finallye caſte oute the water, and if you ſee
yet anye of the yellowe, remayne vpon the ſaied paſte,
waſhe it againe, as before, and couer it with a paper,
lettinge it ſo drye of it ſelfe, in the ſunne. After this you
ſhall take three partes of the ſaied paſte, or whyte poul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
foure partes of white Pommeiſe ſtone, as is afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayed,
two partes of white Bengewine, one parte of
Roche Alome well burned, one parte of white Corall,
halfe a parte of white yuorye, halfe a parte of Alebla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
verie white. Breake and bruſe all theſe well vpon
a table of marble, or in a ſyluer cuppe, puttinge to it
ſome ſiluer foile, and thus ſhall you haue a very whyte

<pb n="83" facs="tcp:4590:83"/>
as white as ſnowe. And if you will, you waye put it to
keepe in a conſerue, with the ſyrope of Ceder, or honny
Roſet, or otherwiſe as you will. Alſo, if you will make
the ſaied poulder verye redde, dreſſe it onelye with the
<hi>Lacca</hi> of graine, and a lyttle redde corall. Nowe, becauſe
that in ſtampinge, it will waxe ſomewhat white, put to

manye thinges required in Phiſicke, it is better to put

the preceptes of Geber, of Saynte Thomas,

whom there be that ſublime it a hundreth times, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſome two hundreth tymes, and yet at thende bring
it to none effect: and that cometh, becauſe that alwayes
they put in, in ſubliminge the ſaied lecs, that is to ſaye,
the ſalte, alome, or vitriole, as we haue ſaied. And ſeing
that the nature of the fyre is to fix and make firme thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
that ſone flit awaye, the oftener the ſaied ſublime
cometh to the fyre, the more doth it faſten at euery time,
but that part that is faſtened, is alwaies mingled with
the ſaied lees, and ſo is loſt: Therfore they which made
the ſaied ſublimation, not conſideringe the reaſons and
cauſes why ſuche a thinge happeneth, founde that by
little and little theyr ſublime was diminiſhed, and (per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aduenture)
thought it hadde flowen awaye, or els con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed

in the ſaied lees, from the whiche it can in no wyſe

be ſeparated. Nowe mindinge philoſophicallye to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede
in the faſteninge or fixinge the ſaied ſublyme, you
muſt fyrſte ſublime it three or foure times, with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
ſalte, burned Alome, lime, or Talchum, as is ſaied
to the intent that in this wiſe it may be mondified, and
clenſed from all earthy and vncleane ſubſtaunce, that
it conteyneth, and frome the ſuperfluous moiſture,
whereof it is full. It is mondified and made cleane of
the earthy ſubſtaunce, becauſe the earth ſublimeth not,
but remayneth in the bottome of the viole or pot, clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinge
with the grounes, whiche is the Salte, Alome,
or Vttriole that is put in it, the whiche thinges we call
here lees or dregges, becauſe they remaine in the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome,
as the lees of wine, or of Oyle doeth. Alſo it is
pourged of the aquoſitie, or ſuperfluous moiſture, two
maner of wayes. The fyrſte is, becauſe that with the
ſame, or diſtilled water, wherwith it was watered, as
we haue ſaied before, the moiſture or watrineſſe of the
ſaied Quick ſiluer diſtilleth out in a vapour. The other
is, becauſe of the ofte ſubliminge it, the nature of the
fyre is annexed vnto it, whiche diminiſheth it, the whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
two thinges are the principall cauſe whye it faſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth.
And ſo are they the onelye partes that make the
perfyt fixion or faſteninge, accordinge as they are ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
ioyned with the thinges that you wyl faſten or
fixe. And here we meane no other thinge, by the thynge
fixed or faſtened, but that the fyre hath made ſuche a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction,
that it daniſheth not awaye, or is lightly caried
awaye with the wynde, and that all the ſubſtaunce re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayneth
in the bottome, and conſumeth no more.</p>
                  <p>Therefore, after you haue ſublimed it three or foure
tymes, and that it is well pourged of the carthye ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaunce,
and of the ſuperfluous moiſture, as is afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayed,
you ſhall ſet it to ſublime a parte by it ſelfe, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oute

                  <p>Whan you haue ſublimed it three or foure times, or

and whan it is ſublimed, mingle that whiche is

ſublime it again, and ſo, ſo often that it ryſe vp no more
but remayne in the bottome for al the vehemence of the

a good quantitie of it, and is not hable to putte to it as
muche fyne ſiluer, as the fourth part of it, he may make
it in this maner folowinge. After he hath ſublimed it
three or foure times, with the grownes or lees, as is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaied,
let him kepe it by it ſelfe, and take a little of it
that is to ſaye, as muche as for to ioyne or put with the
fourth part of fyne ſyluer, that he ſhould put to it, as in

vntyll all remayne fixed in the bottome, and he ſhall

and then let him mingle all together, and ſublime it as

made meete for the purpoſe, that maye reache to the
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:4590:106"/>
bottome of the ſaied veſſell, and be more then a hande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full

the ſayed ſticke ſo being put into the viol, it maye cloſe
the mouth of it, and that whan the ſticke riſeth vp, the

the mouth of the ſaied violle. You muſte haue alſo

the necke of it within the mouthe of the vyolle,
and that the ſticke maye go thorough the myddle of the
funnell, that by that meanes, it maye ſtoppe the ſtrayte
of the funnell, with the mouthe of the violle.</p>
                  <p>All theſe thinges thus ſet in order, you muſte keepe the
ſaied poulder nyghe vnto the fyre, to the intente that
it maye be hoate: for if you ſhoulde putte it in colde,
vppon the hoate that is in the Violle, you ſhould make
colde, and lette the ſublimation of the <hi>Cinabrium.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Nowe, whan the fyrſte poulder hath bene on the fyre,
the ſpace of fyue houres, and that it is thoroughlye, or
partelye ſublimed, lyfte vppe the ſticke a little, that is
in the potte, and ſo open the mouth of it, in lyftinge vp
the rounde piece of claye that ſtopped it, and putte in
three or foure ſponefulles of the ſaied poulder that you
kepte warme, then lette downe the ſticke, with the
rounde buttonne of claye, that it maye cloſe the vyolle,
as before.</p>
                  <p>And you muſte vnderſtande, that the ſayed ſticke is
not put into the violle for anye other cauſe, but to kepe
that the ſayed poulder whiche is in the bottomme, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginninge
to ſublyme, ſhoulde not cleaue rounde about
the mouth of the violle, for than it woulde ſtoppe it ſo,
that you coulde putte none other poulder into it, nor
make the loaues ſoo greate, as is ſayed: and herein
conſyſteth the whole Secrete to make the loues great.
For if you woulde putte in all the ſubſtaunce at once,
that is to ſaye, a hundrethe, or twoo hundreth pounde
of ſubſtaunce, you ſhoulde make the maſſe, or lumpe
<pb facs="tcp:4590:107"/>
ſo great, that it woulde neuer be broughte to perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and muſte make ſo greate a fyre to it, that rather it
woulde melte both the veſſell, and alſo marre the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neis,
than the matter or ſubſtaunce woulde ſublyme.</p>
                  <p>But in puttinge it in thus by little and little, the ſticke
beinge in the middle, all the ſubſtaunce ſublimeth, ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth,
and waxeth redde, and by little and little, ſticketh
to the higheſt parte of the veſſell, then, in puttinge to it
agayne newe poulder, it deſcendeth to the bottom, and
there findinge all thinges hote, with that that it is hote
it ſelf, and in a ſmal quantitie it ſublimeth, baketh, and
waxeth redde incontinent, incorporatinge it ſelfe with
the fyrſte. So in puttinge in, by little and little newe
hote poulder, and keping alwayes the fyre in one ſtate,
you ſhal make as great a quantitie of it as you wil, and
ſhal haue very great loaues of fayre <hi>Cinabrium,</hi> the whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
wyll haue onely a hole in the middle, whiche is the
ſpace where the ſticke went thorow. Finally, you may
put to it newe poulder in takinge awaye the ſticke all
together, and cloſing the mouth, and than make a fire:
for this laſt poulder wyll lykewiſe ſublyme, and wyll
make a bottome to the lofe of <hi>Cinabrium,</hi> Moreouer, note
and vnderſtande, that the great fyre, that is to ſay, long
continued and kept, hurteth not, and now and then you
muſt moue, and lifte vp and downe the ſayde ſticke, to
the intent that the <hi>Cinabrium</hi> cleaue not to it, and ſtoppe
ſo the mouth of the veſſell, that you can putte no more
freſhe poulder to it, as is ſayed. This is the ſure, and
perfecte waye and meane howe to make <hi>Cinabrium</hi> in as
greate loaues as you will, whiche hytherto hath not
bene knowen in Italye. You maye do the like in pottes
of potters claye white, ſoo that they be well luted and
clayed ouer, that they maye endure the fyre, and not
breake.</p>

ſomewhat blacke, whiche peraduenture a man may ſay
is like theyr grene. The white is in little longe pieces,
with certayne ſynewes or veines all a longe, ſo like vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>to
Roche Alome, that many are deceiued, or deceiue o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with it: For whan a man ſetteth the ſaied Borar
vpon the fyre, it boyleth, and ſwelleth vp in all poyntes
like Alome, and ſo remayneth white, and full of hoales
lyke a ſponge, and eaſy to be broken with your handes,
euen as Roche Alome burned. But ſubtyle and craftye
marchauntes knowe Borax from Alome thre maner of

is eygre and ſharpe of taſte, and reſtraintife, but Borax
hath no maner of taſte, but a dead and vnſauery guſte,
as a meane betwene the ſauour of Oyle, and whaye of

for to moderate the eygerneſſe of the Alome, with the

ſomewhat lyke vnto Borarx but fyrſte they differ

longe in fourme, and the ſtones where Alome is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monge,
are neuer broughte into anye fourme, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
little ſquare ſtones. Furthermore, thei differre in the
ſeconde ſorte, and that is this: That Alome beynge
burned, maketh a greater lumpe, then when it is raw:
but the true Borax is broughte and reduced into a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye
ſmall quantitie, and this is an euidente ſigne to
knowe it. The thyrde, whiche is of mooſt importaunce
and the ſureſte, is, that the matter wherein the Alome
is, will not ſouder in no manner of wiſe, and wyll not
melte neither, ſo well as the Borax will. I ſaye, it will
not melte ſo well, becauſe that where any Salt Peter,
Tartre, and <hi>Sal alcali</hi> is, there the matter will melte, at
the leaſte in ſome parte: for all the ſaied thinges helpe
to the foundinge of metalles. The Salte Peter, whan
there is a good quantitie of it, is knowen incontinente
vppon the fyre, for it maketh the boylinge wateryſhe,
and caſteth aboute, as it were lyttle ſparkes of fyre.</p>
                  <p>The other thinges made with the foreſayed mixions,
dyuers tymes, in whaye, milke, or in water, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geled
into lyttle pebbles, make certayne ſtones, but
they be alwayes ſalte, to brighte, and to violente to
melte: for whan a manne wyll ſouder anye worke of
Golde, or thinne Syluer with it, it cauſeth the worke
to melte together, and where as there is Sugre, it
leaueth the Golde and Syluer ſpotted. Men make o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
mixtures, whiche are verye good for to ſouder, or
to melte, whiche neuertheleſſe are differente frome the
Borax in fourme and ſauoure, of the whiche we wyll
make mention hereafter.</p>
                  <p>Nowe, for to retourne to the true Borax of oure
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:4590:108"/>
tyme, men bringe vs certayne barrels full, of a kind of
greaſe, ful of certayne litle pebbles, which is called the
dowe or paſte of Borare. Vnto this daye menne haue
broughte it oute of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> where it was alſoo of
olde tyme made: and therefore is it that the aunciente
Arabian Anthones, whiche haue wrytten of thynges
concernynge mettalles, called the Borax <hi>Nitrum Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andrinum.</hi>
And within theſe fewe yeares, they haue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonne
to brynge it frome the Weſte partes, yet I can
not tell whether it be made there, or elles paraduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
it be broughte latelye oute of the Indes. There
was within theſe fewe yeares ſoo greate lacke of it in
Italye, that it was ſolde at the leaſte, for a crowne an
vnce, of that, that was made into ſtones. And nowe,
within this twoo yeare, there is come ſuche hahoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunce
oute of the Weſte partes, that the pounde is
worth but a crowne and a halfe, and leſſe.</p>
                  <p>The waye howe to make it (whiche is vſed in the
ſaied Weſt partes) is thus. In Mines, where Golde
and Syluer, or Copper is gotten, is found a kynde of
water, whiche (as I my ſelfe haue ſeene and proued by
experience) is of it ſelfe verye neete and excellente for to
ſouder or to founde with. And alſo I knowe a place in
Germanye, where there is a greate veyne of ſuche wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
whiche notwithſtandinge, the payſauntes knowe
not of. Nowe, they take this water, with the earth that
is vnderneath it, or on the ſydes, and boyle it a certaine
tyme, and than ſtrayne it, and ſo leauinge it, it conge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
into lyttle pebbles, euen like vnto Salte Peter.</p>
                  <p>And therefore yf a man ſhoulde keepe theim longe ſoo,
thei would not continue, but would reſolue by litle and
litle: Alſo for to make them better, and to preſerue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
and noriſhe them in their owne nature and kynde, they
take the groundes or dregges that is left of the ſaid wa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter,
&amp; earth, putting to it barrows greaſe, or the greaſe
of ſome other beaſt: than they goo to the mine, where
they make a greate hole in the grounde, in the bottome
wherof they lay a ranck of the ſaid greaſe, &amp; vpon that a
<pb facs="tcp:4590:109"/>
rancke of the ſayde little pebble ſtones, and than again
another of greaſe, and ſo conſequently as much as they
wyll, but ſo that the laſte rancke be of greaſe, or of the
ſaied dowe or paſte, and ſo they leaue it open and vnco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered,
the ſpace of certayne moneths: yet many of them
do all this within theyr houſes, in the earth, or in great
veſſelles. Than, whan they wyll ſell it, or ſende it out
of the countrey, they take the ſayed paſte or dowe, with
the ſtones and all, with a fyre panne or ſome like thing,
and fyll barelles and tonnes of it.<note place="margin">Alexis ſpea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>keth of Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and not the tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland.</note> This is the ſame that
commeth vnto vs, whiche we call dowe or paſte of Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rax.
It is ſent alſo from the countreye where Borax is
made, or little ſtones of the ſayed paſte, ſo renewed and
fined as I will ſhewe you. About thyrty yeare ago they
ſent muche more of this Borax, fyned and renewed,
than they did of the paſte, becauſe that in Italye they
coulde not dreſſe nor make it, nor bringe it into little
ſtones, wherefore it was not put in vre, but of certayne
wemen in diſtillations, for to paint them ſelues with.
Since there hath ben one in Veniſe that began to dreſſe
it, and after him a woman whom he had taught. Theſe
two gat a greate ſomme of money, and the ſayd ſecrete
was longe betwene them two onely, althoughe it was
deſyred of euery man longe before. Finally, it is nowe
come ſo farre forwarde, that many men in Venyſe can
dreſſe it, but one maketh it farre better, then another,
and peraduenture very fewe haue the perfection of dreſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſynge
it, with ſuche adnauniage that he looſe nothinge
of the ſubſtaunce, and to make as muche of it as is poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
perfectly, as I will ſhewe you hereafter folowing.
Now, you muſte take fyrſt of the ſayd paſte, that is not
mouldy, vinewed, or putrified, for than it is a ſign that
it ſhoulde be olde, and of many yeares, and thereby the
little ſtones ſhoulde be diminiſhed, loſte, or decayed. Yet
neuertheleſſe this is of no great importaunce: for it is
better to aſſay with your finger within the paſt, to ſe yf
it be full of the ſayed pebbles, for the worlde beynge all
together geuen to gayne, and full of deception and
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:4590:109"/>
fraude, they that make it, put ſometime very fewe peb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
in the ſaied greaſe, for to haue more ſubſtaunce:
and beſyde this, they that bye it to ſell agayne, take out
alſo a good quantitie of the ſaied pebbles: wherefore it
is neceſſary to be circumſpecte, to the intente that dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
maye ſurmounte, or at the leaſte diſcouer the gile
and deceate. Fynallye, if you will fine and renewe the
ſayed Borax from ſuche paſte or dowe, do thus. Take
water luke warme, that is to ſaye, for twoo pounde of
paſte, halfe a payle full, whiche you ſhall put into ſome
earthen veſſell, puttinge the paſte into it, than with
youre hande fraye and ſtyrre it in ſonder, as you wolde
temper leauen for to kneade, after this, ſtrayne out the
ſaied water well thoroughe a ſtraynoure, and take the
little ſtones that remaine in the ſaied veſſell, that is to
ſay, thoſe that be of the bigneſſe of a Walnut, or beane,
and put them in a veſſell, ſprinklinge them with Oyle
Olyue, as thoughe it were a ſalade, but the Oyle muſt
be white: and if you haue none good, take common oyle
and ſet it in the ſunne, purginge it well, and annointe
the ſaied ſtones with it, minglinge them well together
with your hande. Afterward put them in a litle bagge,
and mixe them well together againe, as men do confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
this doen, putte theim in little boxes, and keepe
theim, and thus ſhall you haue the beſt Borax that can
be poſſible. If you will renew and multiplie it, do thus.
Take the ſame water that was ſtrayned out, and put it
in a kettle vpon a ſmall fyre, keepinge the fyre alwayes
in one eſtate, than ſcymme it with an yron ladle, and
put alſo with the ſcumme, the ordure and filth that ſhal
be in the bottome: but take good heede, that in ſeething
it flie not awaye. Continue thus dooinge vntyll it be
well ſodden, whiche is knowen thus: put a little vpon
your nayle and if it renne not, it is ynough ſodden, or
els you may proue it vpon a paper, as men do Syrops,
and if it byde ſtill, it is ſodden, or wette a ſtringe in the
ſayed water, and holde it betwixte youre fingers, than
plucke it oute by the ende, and if you feele it roughe, it
<pb facs="tcp:4590:110"/>
is ſodden. Then take the kettle from the fyre, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
it with ſome couer fytte for it, that there fall no or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
or fylth in it: this doen, burie the kettle in wheate
branne, and cloſe it well rounde aboute, coueringe it
with clothes or other thinges, ſo that it be wel ſtopped.
You maye bury it, or hyde it in a hote dungehyll, and
leaue it there the ſpace of eight or ten dayes, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde
vncouer it, and you ſhall finde cruſte vpon it, the
whiche you ſhall take and put in on one ſyde, and you
ſhall finde in the ſayed kettle, as it were little pieces of
yce, whiche you ſhall take oute, and put in another veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell,
waſſhinge them with cole and freſhe water, than
drye them vpon a table in the ſhadowe, and lette thoſe
ſtones whiche at the firſte time remayned in the ſtray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noure,
be mingled with the ſaied pieces of yce. Than
take Alome de fece, that is white, foure pounde, in thre
payles full of water, three vnces of Salte Peter, than
boyle this with a ſmall fyre, and ſcymme it, as you dyd
the other, in prouinge it vpon your nayle, or vpon pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
if it bee ſodden, as before. This doen, take it from
the fyre, and let it reſt, and whan it is cleare, take a litle
payle full and a halfe of it, and ſet it on the fyre in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
cleane kettle. And whan you ſee that it will boyle,
put in the ſayed cruſte, and that it be of tenne pounde,
and make it ſeeth as the other did, eſſayinge vpon your
nayle or paper, as you did before. Than put it in a little
virkin, and lay two ſtickes a croſſe, with foure cordes,
wherevnto you ſhall tie a little leade, to the intent they
may ſtretche well, and without touchinge the bottome,
by foure fingers, and that to the ende the Borax maye
ſticke and cleaue to it, and than burie it as before. This
muſt not be put int the bagge, but anoint the ſame that
you finde ſtickinge vpon the cordes with a feather, and
the other that remayneth ſtil in the veſſel, you ſhal ſprin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>kle
as it were a ſalade. The clere that you ſhal take out
of it, muſt be of the biggeneſſe of a haſell nut or beane:
and the other will be leſſe, you ſhall put into the water
that remaineth, whiche water you ſhall ſet on the fire,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:4590:110"/>
makinge it ſeeth, and doinge as before, and ſo continue
vntill all the water be conuerted and tourned into Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rax,

whan you diſſolue in luke warme water, as

that the pottes whiche be made of it, and wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in

in. Take then of the beſte, and ſpecially if it muſt
ſerue for a thinge that hath neede to be longe vppon a
great fyre, otherwiſe, take ſuche as you can get. There
is founde of it, that is of a graye colour, as the common
ſorte is, and alſo there is white, that men vſe in ſome
place of <hi>Vicence,</hi> whiche is like loaues of <hi>Gipſum,</hi> or plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,

as in <hi>Apulia,</hi> where there is greate quantitie, and that
they call Boale, and is the very ſame that ſome Apoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caries
do ſell for Boale Armenick, and the Venitians

with lime, bricke, and Vermillion, coueringe it af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwarde
with Oyle of line. This redde earth is the
fatteſt, and the clammieſt of all the reſt, and therefore it
cleaueth ſooneſt by the fyre, if it be not tempered with
ſome other ſubſtaunce. And becauſe that all the ſayed
earthes be to fatte, the one more than the other, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
men put to them ſome leane ſubſtaunce. Nowe, if
you take of that of aſhe colour, whiche is moſt commen,
and the leſt fatty, you may compoſe and make it in this
maner. Take of the ſaied earth foure partes, of cloth-makers
floxe or ſhearing, one part, aſhes that haue ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
in a buck, or other, half a part, drie horſe donge, or
the donge of an Aſſe, one part. If you will make it par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiter,
put to it a fewe ſtamped brickes, and ſparkes of
yron: let all theſe thinges be well ſtamped, and ſifted,
that is to ſaye: the earth, the aſhes, the horſe donge, the
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:4590:114"/>
brickes, and the ſparkes of yron: than mingle all toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and make it into earth, and make a bedde thereof,
vpon the whiche you ſhall caſte by little and little, the
floxe, as equally as you can. This doen, powre to it wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
ſtyringe it well fyrſte with a ſticke, and than with
a pallet broade at the ende. And whan all is well incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porated
together, as you woulde haue it, laye it vppon
ſome great borde, and beat it wel, and that a good ſpace
with ſome great ſtaffe, or other inſtrument ofyron, min<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>glinge
and ſtearinge it well, for the lenger you beate it,
the better it is. By this meane you ſhall haue a verye
good claye for to lute or clay, and ioyne violles, flagons
of glaſſe to ſtill with, and bottels of gourdes for ſtilling
and other great thinges, as furneſſes and ſuche like, as
we will declare afterwarde. But he that will make it
with more eaſe, let him put the earth only, the flox, and
the horſe donge, with a fewe aſhes. Some put no horſe
donge to it, and ſome no floxe, according to the purpoſe
that they make it for. For to ſtop and cloſe vp the mou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thes
of ſtillinge glaſſes, or violles, to thintent they take
no vent on the fyre, the ſayed clay wil be very good: ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheleſſe
men put to it two partes of quicke lime, and
the whites of Egges, and then it wyl be ſurer to let no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinge
vent out but the glaſſe it ſelf. All kinde of clay or
earth would be kept moiſt, and redy dreſſed for him that
will occupy it continually, but it muſte not be kepte to
watery nor yet lefte to drye, for than it woulde ſerue
for nothinge, ſeinge that after it is once hardened, a
man can not dreſſe it anye more to do any good withal.
And whan you put water to it, it is mollified by little
and little aboue, and is as it were a ſauce, but within
remayneth harde, and if you put to much water to it,
you marre it vtterlye. Therefore, whan you ſee that it
beginneth to waxe drye, feede it a newe little and little

they be dreſſed and faſhioned with the whele: then put
them, ſo wrapped in the ſame paſte, into an ouen with

And whan you haue taken of the paſte, you ſhall finde
your ſtones harde, as if they were naturall. If you ſe it

bake them againe in the ouen, and than ſhall you haue

                     <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Einge that we are entered into the matter
of calcininge, we will ſhewe you the calci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of fine ſyluer, and than of <hi>Talcum,</hi> as
we haue promiſed before. There be diuers
wayes of calcininge ſyluer, wherof we wil
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:4590:121"/>
put here three of the beſt. Take fine ſyluer beaten very
fine and thinne, then cut it in pieces as bigge as a Spa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>niſhe
ryall, or more or leſſe, for it maketh no great mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:
then take a croſet, or an erthen potte, and lay in the
bottome of it a rancke of common ſalte, not white, nor
prepared or trimmed to eate, but euen as it cometh out
of the ſalines or ſalt panne, and it muſt be ſtamped very
ſmall. Vpon this ſalt you ſhall laye likewiſe a rancke of
the ſayd pieces of ſyluer, and then another of ſalte, and
another of ſiluer, and ſo conſequently as longe as your
ſyluer laſteth, in ſuch ſorte, that the laſt rancke may be
of ſalte, and that good and thicke: then couer all this
with a paper, lutinge and clayinge well the croſet, or
little earthen potte, and leauinge a little hole in the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueringe
the biggeneſſe of a gooſe quill. And whan it is
drie, couer it ouer, and rounde aboute, with coales and
embers, and leaue it in ſuche a fyre, at the leaſt three or
foure houres: then hauing taken it out, and all beyng
coole, open the croſet, and take out the pieces of Syluer
one after another, makinge theim cleane that the ſalte
ſtick not vpon them. And if you perceiue that they be ſo
brittle that you may break them with your finger, like
a cruſt of bread, it is done &amp; made: if not, put them again
into the croſet or pot, ſetting them in the fyre as before.
And to make it perfitly, you ought to do this thre tymes
or more. This doen, make your ſiluer into poulder, and
waſh it in a diſhfull of hote water, &amp; let it ſincke to the
bottom. After, ſtraine out the water ſo handſomly, that
you loſe no part of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſaid poulder: or to auoid al dau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gers
paſſe it thorow a felt: this doen, put other hote water to
it, &amp; ſtraine it out as before, ſo often tyll you may know
by the taſt of the water, that al the ſalt is purged away.
Than ſhal your ſyluer be well calcined, &amp; diminiſhed of
the weight, dried, and become fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his nature into a maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſif
part, and ſomwhat like vnto gold. Thus wil it ſerue
you for diuers thinges, if you can dreſſe it wel. The like
is done with <hi>Talcum,</hi> in ſteade of common ſalt: but than
you nede not waſſhe it in hote water. Some calcyne it
<pb facs="tcp:4590:122"/>
with ſalte, or Talcum twelue or .xv. times, and more,
to the intent to haue it more maſſiue and ſounder, and
more commodious to take colour. It maye be alſo doen
in this manner, that is to ſaye, to melte the ſyluer in a
Goldſmithes meltinge pot, and for euerye vnce of the
ſame, to put in a pound or more of Brimſtone ſtamped,
and that little and little. True it is, that ſo it wyll con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume
more than by the ſalte, or Talcum, but it ſhall be
farre better if the Brimſtone be fyrſt purged in ſtronge
lye (that is to ſaye, made with ſtronge aſhes, and quicke
lime, or ſuch lyke thinges.) Nowe let vs come to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

will be hote if the water be good. Let it ſo boyle, vntyll
it boyle nor eate no more, holdinge ſtyl the violl in your

But if the water be not ſtronge, you muſt ſet it a lyttle

it would make it deſcende to the bottome in little round
pieces, like pearles, or like ſande. Nowe, after that the
