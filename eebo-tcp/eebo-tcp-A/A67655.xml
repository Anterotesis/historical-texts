            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The first sort is called a <hi>Gilter.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THis <hi>Gilter</hi> is one that hath all sorts of Picklocks and false Keys to open any Locks both of Dores, Chests, Trunks and the like. There are several sorts that do creep to these sort of Thieves, as the <hi>Budge,</hi> the <hi>Lister,</hi> and the private Thieves, as when they see any locking up of moneys and they cannot get at it, then they go to one of these <hi>Gilters,</hi> and tell him that they know where he can get a prize if he will be real to them, whereupon he will swear that he will be as honest as <hi>Easter Newmans</hi> wife, and so these <hi>Gilters</hi> are seldome out of imployment, but the best Informers are the private Thieves which shall be discovered in order.</p>
            <p>The way to prevent these Gilters, is to be careful that you let not any see your Chest, Trunk, or Boxes where your Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure is, opened, nor see you put any thing into them, for oper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity makes thieves, and in so doing you will prevent the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Thief, who gives notice to the Gilter where he may get the prize: the Gilter very seldome goes but where he hath some notice. Secondly be sure you keep your outward door well bolted, and then he is prevented entring into your house, for he goes only with Picklocks.</p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>The manner of those that go upon the <hi>Mill,</hi> which are called House-Breakers.</head>
               <p>The second sort of theives are those that go upon the <hi>Mill,</hi> which are house-breakers, they are the most dangerous of all sorts, they have an instrument made about half a yard long, and almost as long over, which they call a <hi>Betty,</hi> which being chopt under a door, with a little help, it will make it fly off
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:35348:4"/>
the hinges. There seldome goes less then three or four in at gang of these, and very seldome but where they are informed by the private Thieves: when they enter, they carry in one hand a dark <hi>Glim,</hi> and in the other a <hi>Poller,</hi> which is a dark <hi>Lanthorn</hi> and a <hi>Pistol,</hi> so they truck up the dancers, which is run up stairs and bind all in the house, and some they gagg, which they call <hi>faget</hi> and <hi>storm,</hi> so having made all sure, they rifle the house for yellow-boyes and pieces of white, which is Gold and Silver, and if they find none, they take the best bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leroyes or Lurryes they can find and pike off with them.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>To prevent those that go upon the Mill.</head>
               <p>You must be sure to keep your door well bolted, but let your bolts be to bolte at the topp of your door, for if it be bolted at the top, it will break the force of the <hi>Betty,</hi> so that they cannot open the dore with all the strength they can. Secondly put a plate over your hinges and it will do much good for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting of them, some may think that this is needless, but let them try it, and they will find it the best way to prevent those that go upon the Mill.</p>

            <div type="part">
               <head>The manner of those that are called Glasiers.</head>
               <p>The third sort of Thieves which are called Glasiers, are the right quarrel-pickers, they are a sort of cowardly thieves, they take out a pane of glass, and so go in at the window, and take what stands next them, and give it to one that stayes without to give him a watchword if there be any discovery, but if there be none, he will not stay long, for he is very fearful of the least noise that is, so having got out, he makes all the hast a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way to his fencing cins, where he will brag of his bold attempt and how he had like to been taken, which some of his concerns will seem glad that he escaped, which pleases well the humour of this glasier.</p>

               <p>Is to have shutters to your windows, for he will not venter to break them for fear of making a noise, so that if ye have shutters there is no work for these sort of Glasiers.</p>

            <div type="part">
               <head>The fourth and fift sort is a Budge and Snudge.</head>
               <p>A Budge and Snudge commonly go together, a Budge is one that goes loytering up and down the street, till he can find somebodies door open, then he runs in boldly, and if he be seen by any body, he craves pardon for being so bold, and sayes that he is mistaken in the house, and asks for somebody that lives next door, or somebody that did live there before, but if there be no body in the house, then they are so bold to take what stands next them and gives it to his Snudge, who snudges away with it to his fencing cins who buyes it for a small matter, so they sit down and never stir till they have spent it, according to the old Proverb, <hi>easily come, easily go,</hi> so they please themselves with a Song that sutes very well with their idle life,<note place="margin">

I remember a true Story of one of these sorts of <hi>Tongue Padds</hi> that was lame, who went always when he had done any Feat to their Randevouze, and he would be so just that he would not bate a Penny of his share, which when they were taken they discovered this <hi>Tongue-Padd,</hi> and going to the place of Execution, one of them turn'd back, and seeing him follow, he burst out to laughter, which the Minister correcting, said how can you laugh when you are a going to dye, (who said) I cannot forbear laughing to see the old <hi>Tongue-Pad</hi> come hop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping after us for his Snack, I warrant he will not bate a Penny of his due.</p>
