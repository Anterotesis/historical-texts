            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>'TIS hard, me thinks, that a Man cannot Publish a Book, but he must presently give the World a <hi>Reason</hi> for't; when yet there's not <hi>One</hi> Book of <hi>Twenty</hi> that will <hi>bear</hi> a <hi>Reason;</hi> not <hi>One Man</hi> of a <hi>Hundred,</hi> perhaps, that is able to <hi>Give</hi> One; nor <hi>One Reason</hi> of a <hi>Thousand</hi>

            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:42735:6"/>This Treatise of <hi>Offices,</hi> I find to be one of the Commonest <hi>School-Books</hi> that we have; and as it is the <hi>Best</hi> of <hi>Books;</hi> so it is apply'd to the <hi>Best</hi> of <hi>Purposes;</hi> that is to say, to the Training up of <hi>Youth,</hi> in the <hi>Study</hi> and <hi>Exercise</hi> of <hi>Virtue.</hi> The <hi>Foundations</hi> of an <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable,</hi> and a <hi>Blessed Life,</hi> are laid in the very <hi>Cradle;</hi> and we suck in the Tincture of <hi>Generous,</hi> or <hi>Perverse Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> even with <hi>our Mothers Milk:</hi> Insomuch that we may date the greater part of our greatest Miscarriages, from the <hi>Errors,</hi> and <hi>Infelicities</hi> of our <hi>First Institution,</hi> and <hi>Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>

But tho', upon the whole matter, I do Highly approve of the <hi>Usage</hi> of <hi>This Book</hi> in <hi>Schools,</hi> I must confess yet, with Submission, that I am not at all satisfy'd in the <hi>ordinary Way</hi> of using it. For the cutting of it out into <hi>Particles,</hi> here and there a <hi>Chop,</hi> makes it a <hi>Les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi> to the Boys, rather of <hi>Syn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tax,</hi> then <hi>Morality;</hi> beside the <hi>prejudice</hi> that it suffers under the Trivial name of a <hi>School-Book;</hi> and the <hi>disgust</hi> which naturally continues with us, even when we are <hi>Men,</hi> for that which we were <hi>whipt</hi> for, when we were <hi>Boyes.</hi>

the saying of <hi>Crassus,</hi>

And Those also that Rob one man, to give to another, are guilty of the same Injustice, with them, that take Mony out of their Neighbors Pockets, to put into their Own.

provided that it may be done without Injury. And yet we are to distinguish also betwixt <hi>Benefits Receiv'd</hi>; and the <hi>Greater</hi> the <hi>Benefit,</hi> the <hi>Greater</hi> is the <hi>Obligation.</hi> Now the <hi>Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation</hi> is to be valu'd according to the <hi>Mind,</hi> the <hi>Intention,</hi> and <hi>Good Will</hi> of the <hi>Giver</hi>: For many People do many things <hi>rashly,</hi>

                  <l>To put a Wandring Traveller in's Way,</l>

            <p>FROM this One Case we may learn, that whatsoever we may part with to Another,<note place="margin">Benefits in Common.</note> without any Damage to our selves, it is our Duty to Give, or to Lend Freely, tho' to a Stranger. Of This sort, we reckon many things to be in <hi>Common</hi>; as <hi>Water from a Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; Fire from Fire; Good Counsel to a Man

And there is yet a nearer Tye; and That is, the Society of Kindred, which is Contracted into a narrow place, apart from the Vast Society of Mankind. It is by Nature, Common to all living Creatures, the appetite of producing the Kind: And the First Society is in Wedlock,<note place="margin">Marriage, Children, Families.</note> the next, in Children; it comes then to a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, and a Community of all things. And this is the Original of a City, and as it were the Seminary of a Commonwealth. The Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of Brothers comes next; and after
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:42735:24"/>
That, of Brothers, and Sisters Children; who, when they are too many for One House, are transplanted into Others, as into Colonies. And then follow Matches, and Alliances, with increase of Kindred;<note place="margin">Kindred.</note> and their Off-spring is the Beginning of a Commonwealth. There is no doubt but Relation of Blood, and the Kindness that arises from it, must necessarily endear Men to One another. For it is a great matter to have the same Pedigree; to exercise the same Religion, and to deposite their Ashes in Common Sepulchres: But of all Associa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,<note place="margin">Friendship.</note> there is none so Firm, none so Noble, as when Virtuous Men are link'd together by a Correspondency of Manners; and a Freedom of Conversation. For such is the Charm of That Honesty which we have often spoken of, that the very Encounter of it moves us, tho' in a Stranger, and makes us Friends to the Possessor of it, where-ever we find it. Now tho' all Virtue whatsoever, is, of it self, Ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and Attractive; insomuch that we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but have an Esteem for those that we find possess'd of it; yet <hi>Iustice,</hi> and <hi>Liberality</hi> gain upon us in a higher degree.

               <note place="margin">Our Duty to our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.</note> and every honest man is ready to lay down his life for the advantage of that sacred Interest.

               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:42735:25"/>In the propounding of <hi>Four general Heads,</hi> from whence all Virtues, and Duties flow; That which is done with a Noble, and Exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Mind; a Mind advanced to the Contempt of Fortune, and Worldly things;<note place="margin">Magnani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity.</note> that Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, I say, ought to be reputed the most Glorious: and therefore that Reproach of <hi>Ennius</hi>'s is always at hand upon Occasion:
<q>
                  <l>
                     <hi>Young Men,</hi> in <hi>shew,</hi> but <hi>Wenches,</hi> in your <hi>Hearts;</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>While <hi>Cloelia</hi> plays the <hi>Brave,</hi> and acts your Parts.</l>
                  <l>
                     <hi>You're for Exploits that cost no Sweat, nor Bloud,</hi> &amp;c.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>And on the other side, with what Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port and Rapture do we extol the humour of Brave and Generous Actions? From hence, comes that Field of the Rhetoricians, upon <hi>Marathon, Salamis, Plateae, Thermopilae, Leuctrae, Stratocles</hi>; and from hence it is, that our <hi>Cocles,</hi> the <hi>Decij,</hi> the two <hi>Scipio</hi>'s, <hi>Marcellus,</hi> and a World of others, especially the <hi>Romans</hi> Themselves, are grown so famous, for the Greatness of their Minds. And their ambition of Military honour, may appear in This, that almost all the Statues they have left us, are dress'd up in Armour.</p>
            <p>AND yet That Elevation of Courage, which is seen in Hazzards, and Adventures, unless accompany'd with Justice, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending rather for the Publique, then for it self; That Courage (I say) is so far from
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:42735:26"/>
being a Virtue, that it is a Fault, and a brutal Ferity, inconsistent with the Tenderness of humane Nature. Wherefore the <hi>Stoiques</hi> have well defin'd it,<note place="margin">Courage defined.</note> in calling <hi>Courage, a Virtue contending for Equity.</hi> Nor did any man ever gain the Reputation of <hi>True Valour,</hi> by <hi>Treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi> or <hi>Malice.</hi> Nothing can be <hi>Honest,</hi> but what is Just; and therefore it was notably said of <hi>Plato. As That Knowledge</hi> (says he) <hi>which is divided from</hi> Justice, <hi>is rather</hi> Craft, <hi>then</hi> Wisdom; <hi>so That</hi> Courage, <hi>which is</hi> Bold, <hi>and</hi> Adventerous, <hi>is rather</hi> Temerity, <hi>and</hi> Foolhardiness, <hi>then</hi> Valour; <hi>if it be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed on by</hi> Passion, <hi>or</hi> Interest, <hi>rather then for a</hi> Common Good. Wherefore all Men of Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, and great Undertakings, should be like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise Men of Goodness, Simplicity, Candor, and Friends of <hi>Truth:</hi> which are all Inseparable from Justice. But the Mischief is, that this Tumour, and Elation of Mind, breaks out many times into a <hi>Pertinacy,</hi> and an Ambitious desire of <hi>Rule.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pertinacy and Ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> For as <hi>Plato</hi> has it, the <hi>Lace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demonians</hi> were Naturally inflam'd with an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent desire of Overcoming. So that whoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever has the greatest Soul. is the most addict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to aspiring Thoughts: And to set himself above All; or in Truth rather to stand Alone. It is a very hard matter, for a Man to observe the Tenor of <hi>True Equity</hi> (which peculiarly belongs to Justice) in the Inordinate Appetite of <hi>Superiority</hi> and <hi>Dominion,</hi> From whence it comes to pass, that such men will not be go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd, either by <hi>Reason,</hi> or any <hi>Publique,</hi> and <hi>Lawfull Constitution.</hi> This humour starts Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions in a Commonwealth, that work by
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:42735:26"/>
Bribery, and Corruption, to advance their Power, and their Fortunes; whose business it is, rather to make themselves Greater, by <hi>Violence,</hi> then to keep themselves in a Stati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Equality</hi> by <hi>Iustice.</hi> But the harderany thing is, the fairer it is; nor is there any Time, or Season, that can dispence a man from Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice. Wherefore Those are Truly <hi>Brave,</hi> and <hi>Magnanimous,</hi> that <hi>keep off</hi> an <hi>Injury,</hi> not Those that <hi>offer</hi> it. He that is truly <hi>Wise,</hi> and <hi>Stout,</hi> places That Virtue which is most consonant to Nature, in <hi>Action,</hi> and not in <hi>Glory</hi>; and in <hi>making</hi> himself more Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable then other men, rather then <hi>appearing</hi> so. No man can be said to be truly <hi>Heroique,</hi> that depends, for his Reputation, upon the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the Multitude. But every man, the higher his Stomach is, and the greater his Thirst of Honor, the more easily is he trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported to do Unjust things. He stands upon a Slippery place: For where is the man, who af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all his hazzards, and Travels, does not desire, and expect <hi>Glory,</hi> as a reward of his Adventures?</p>
            <p>YOU shall know a man of <hi>Generosity,</hi>
               <note place="margin">True Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimity.</note> and <hi>Courage,</hi> chiefly by these <hi>two Marques.</hi> First, he despises <hi>outward things,</hi> upon an Opinion that a man should not admire, wish for, or desire any thing but what is Becoming and Honest; nor subject himself to any Person, Passion, or Fortune. The <hi>Other</hi> is a dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Mind (as is said before) that spurs a man to attempt things <hi>Great</hi> and <hi>Profitable</hi>; but <hi>difficult, laborious,</hi> and <hi>dangerous,</hi> as well in the matter of Life it self, as in other Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:42735:27"/>
that belong to't. All the <hi>Splendor,</hi> and <hi>Reputation</hi> (and let me say, the <hi>Profit</hi> also) of These two Things rests in the <hi>Latter</hi>: but the <hi>Cause,</hi> and the <hi>Motive</hi> is in the <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer:</hi> For There is the Rise, and Spring of great Resolves, that carry men even above the Consideration of any thing that is below. The thing it self is seen in <hi>Two particulars: First</hi> in Judging That only to be <hi>Good</hi> which is <hi>Honest</hi>; and, <hi>Secondly,</hi> in a <hi>Freedom</hi> of the Mind from all <hi>Perturbations.</hi> For it must be confest to be the part of a Brave and Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Mind, to look upon Those, as Little Things, which many Account to be Great, and Glorious; and to Contemn them, upon the Foundation of a Firm, and setled Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. It is likewise the part of a Constant, and Invincible Mind, so to bear all sorts of Calamity, and Affliction, as neither to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from the Order of Nature, nor to descend below the Dignities of a Wise man. How Incongruous is it for a man that stands the shock of <hi>Danger,</hi> to be broken with <hi>Lust</hi>? or to endure the Fatigue of <hi>Labour</hi>; and then to be overcome with <hi>Pleasure</hi>? This must therefore be avoided; and so must the greedy desire of <hi>Mony.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Contempt of Mony.</note> There is not a greater Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of a Narrow, and Wretched Mind, then to dote upon <hi>Pelf:</hi> Nothing more hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane, and honourable, then to despise it, if we have it not; and to employ it generously, and do good with it, if we have it. And so for the Affectation of <hi>Glory</hi>:<note place="margin">Affectation of Glory.</note> We must be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of it (as is said already) for it bars a man of his <hi>Liberty</hi>; which a Brave Man will
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:42735:27"/>
rather die, then part with. We should not be sollicitous neither for <hi>Power</hi>; which, in some Cases, we should not receive, and in others, we should lay down We must deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver our selves from all disorders of mind; either by <hi>Fear</hi> or <hi>Appetite:</hi> and likewise from all <hi>Sowerness,</hi> and <hi>Transport,</hi> either of <hi>delight,</hi> or of <hi>Wrath</hi>; that we may be Calm, and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure: In which State, we shall Find both Steadiness, and Credit. There are at this day, and there have been many, that to gain this Repose, have wholly withdrawn them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves from Publique Business: Among These,<note place="margin">A Retired Life.</note> the noblest, and most eminent of Philosophers; and men truly, of great Severity, and Weight; who could neither endure the People, nor Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment: and so retired into Deserts, and Retreats, to live privately with Themselves. And these men, in this Recess, had the same Design with Princes (whose Privilege is to live as they list) that they might want no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but enjoy their Freedom, without Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troll. Wherefore, since both Those that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Power, and the other Idle people that I speak of, aim at the same thing; and have This in common betwixt them; the One thinks they may Gain their End, if they had but ample Fortunes: and the Other, Theirs, if they can but be content with their Own, and with a Little: They may be Both, (for ought I know) in some measure, in the Right. But it must yet be allow'd, that a Private, and Retir'd Life, is both Easier and Safer: And less Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portune, and Troublesome to Others. But the life of Those that apply themselves to
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:42735:28"/>
Publique business, is more profitable to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind; and more conducing to the Acquisiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Honour, and Reputation in the World. Wherefore there is something to be said for those Excellent Wits that dedicate them Selves to Letters; without medling in Publique Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs: And also for such Others, as either for want of Health, or perhaps some more powerful Impediment, have quitted their publique Stations; being well satisfi'd, that others should enjoy the Power and the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit of the Employment. But for those that have none of this Pretence, to talk of despising Government, and Offices, which most people have in great estimation; I do not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, not approve of them, but take them to be much to blame. Not that I disallow of their Judgment, in the little Consideration they seem to have for Glory; but because they are manifestly afraid of the Labours, Troubles, Repulses, and Displeasures that they are to encounter. For there are many that behave themselves <hi>Vnequally</hi> in <hi>Contrary Cases:</hi> Severe Contemners of <hi>Pleasure,</hi> but they sink under <hi>Pain</hi>; Regardless of <hi>Fame,</hi> but dejected with <hi>Scandal.</hi> Nor are they Steady, even in these very Cases: But for those that are by nature, fitted and qualifi'd for Civil Business; I should advise These people to apply themselves to it without delay; and to take some Commission in the Government. For This is Necessary, both as to Publique Administration; a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>d to shew the Greatness of the Mind. And publique Officers, as much perhaps, as Philosophers themselves, (if not more) should be affected
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:42735:28"/>
with a general disdain of External things, (as I have often said) and stated in an Immoveable Tranquility, and security of Mind; which will deliver them from all Anxiety for things to come; and establish them in a life of Constancy, and Honour. Now this Point is by so much easier, for a Philosopher to gain, by how much his Life is less expos'd to the Stroke of Fortune: For there are not many things that he stands in need of: beside, that in case of any disaster, his Fall is not so dangerous. It is but reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able therefore to Conclude, that Men in Great, and Publique Places, are exposed to greater Perturbations of Thought, then those that live in Privacy and Repose. So that a greater Stock of Courage is there Necessary, and a Mind at Liberty from Trouble, and Care. But for him that puts himself into <hi>Business;</hi> let him first consider the <hi>Honesty</hi> of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment; and Then, his Own <hi>Abilities,</hi> to go thorough with it. Wherein let him nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther rashly despair, out of heartlesness, and sloth; nor be over Confident neither, in the Opinion of himself. But in all matters of Business, a man should diligently prepare him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self before he goes about it.</p>
            <p>BUT since most Men take <hi>Military Charges</hi> to be of a greater Consideration then <hi>Civil,</hi>
               <note place="margin">A Compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Virtues with Civil.</note> This Opinion should be a little qualifi'd; For 'tis a very Common thing for men to apply themselves to that course of Life, out of an Itch of <hi>Glory</hi>; and this happens most frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in Men of <hi>large Souls,</hi> and <hi>Abilities</hi>: Espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially

The Other is, to attend the service of the whole, in such sort, that while they are serving one part, they do not abandon another. It is in the Administration of a <hi>Government,</hi> as in the Case of a <hi>Ward:</hi> The <hi>Commission</hi> has a regard to the benefit of those that are deliver'd up in <hi>Charge</hi>; and not those to whom such a Charge, or Care is <hi>Committed.</hi> But they that Provide for One part of the People, and Neglect Another, bring into a City the most pernicious thing in the World; That is to say, <hi>Discord,</hi> and <hi>Sedition:</hi>

It is in the height of our Prosperity, that we should chiefly consult our Friends; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low them more Authority over us then at other times: but we must have a Care of

Entertaining Flatteries, and of being impos'd upon by Fair words, wherein we are too easie to be Mistaken. For such is the Conceipt we commonly have of our selves, that we think no Commendation more then we deserve. From This weakness there arise Innumerable Errors.

            <p>WE are now to speak of the remaining part of Duty; wherein <hi>Bashfulness,</hi> and a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Gracefulness</hi> of Life; <hi>Temperance, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desty,</hi> the Composure of all <hi>Perturbations</hi> of the Mind, and <hi>Moderation,</hi> are to be consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd. Here it is that we find that same <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corum,</hi> or as the <hi>Greeks,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; which is of so Excellent a Nature, that it is Inseparable from Virtue. For whatsoever is <hi>Decent,</hi> is likewise <hi>Honest</hi>; and whatsoever is <hi>Honest,</hi> is <hi>becoming.</hi> But still there is a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt this same <hi>Honesty,</hi> and <hi>Decorum</hi>;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Honesty</hi> and <hi>Decorum.</hi>
               </note> which may be better understood, then explained: For That which <hi>becomes</hi> us, does only <hi>Then</hi> appear, when <hi>Honesty is gone before.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>NOW this <hi>Decorum</hi> does not only appear in the Virtue now in question, but also in the Three former.<note place="margin">A Decorum in Prudence.</note> For the Right and Prudent use of Reason, and Speech; the doing of every thing Considerately; the finding out of Truth, and the Defending of it, looks well in Any man; as on the Other side to be decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, to Mistake, to Slip, to be Impos'd upon, is as misbecoming, as if a man were in a fit of Dotage, or out of his Wits. And so what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever is <hi>Iust,</hi> is also <hi>Gracefull</hi>; and whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is <hi>Vnjust,</hi> or <hi>Dishonest,</hi> is likewise <hi>mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beseeming</hi>?
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:42735:34"/>
And the same Rule holds in <hi>Forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude:</hi> For whatsoever is done <hi>Generously,</hi> and like a Man of <hi>Courage,</hi> cannot but be <hi>Grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full</hi> too, and well-becoming a man; and the <hi>Contrary</hi> as <hi>Reproachfull,</hi> and <hi>Misbecoming.</hi> Wherefore the <hi>Decorum</hi> I here speak of, appears likewise in all other Virtues;<note place="margin">And in all Virtues.</note> and does in such manner appertain to them, that it lies open; and there needs no Mystery to the finding of it out. There is in all Virtue, somewhat that is <hi>Gracefull,</hi> and only <hi>separable</hi> from Virtue, by <hi>Imagination:</hi> As the Gracefulness, and Beauty of the <hi>Body,</hi> cannot well be separated from <hi>Health:</hi> And so it is with the <hi>Gracefulness</hi> here in <hi>question.</hi> It is a <hi>Decorum</hi> that is in a manner so confused with Virtue, that it is In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporated with it; but in the Mind and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, it may be distinguish'd. And there are of it, <hi>Two Sorts.</hi> The <hi>One</hi> is a Certain <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Decorum,</hi>
               <note place="margin">A Decorum General and Special.</note> that shines in all Virtues; and there is <hi>Another</hi> that is subject to This, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent upon it, which respects <hi>every Virtue</hi> in <hi>particular.</hi> The <hi>Former</hi> is Commonly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to be <hi>a Decorum congruous to the Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of Man, in that which differences Man, from Other Living Creatures.</hi> But the <hi>Special Decorum,</hi> as dependent upon the General, they define to be <hi>a quality so Congruous to Nature, that Moderation and Temperance appear in it, with the very Image of a Generous Soul.</hi> This we may judge to be the <hi>Decorum,</hi> which the Poets ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve; whereof we have spoken more in An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other place. But we are then said to observe the <hi>Strict Decorum</hi> of the <hi>Poets,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Deco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum of the Poets.</note> when every <hi>Word,</hi> and <hi>Action</hi> is fitted to the <hi>Dignity,</hi> and
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:42735:35"/>
               <hi>Condition</hi> of the <hi>Person.</hi> As what could be more Improper, and Unseemly then to bring in These just Judges, <hi>AEacus,</hi> and <hi>Minos</hi> with these words in their Mouths, <hi>Let them hate, so they Fear:</hi> Or, <hi>the Father is the Grave of his Own Children.</hi> And yet when <hi>Atreus</hi> says it, what Acclamations are there, because the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression Suites with the Person! But Nature her self, as to us, has given every man his Part, with greatExcellency, and advantage over other Living Creatures. So that the Poets will see to the accommodating of all parts to the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of Persons, even the Observing of a <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corum,</hi> toward the worst of men, as well as the best. But since Nature has assign'd us our parts of Constancy, Moderation, Temperance, Modesty; and the same Nature teaches us not to be wholly careless, how we demean our selves toward one Another; it is clear to us, how far that <hi>Decorum</hi> extends, that belongs to every Virtue, and every kind of Honesty. For as the Beauty of the Body, with an apt disposition of the Parts, proves the Eye; and delights us in the very Correspondence, Syme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try and apt disposition of the Parts; so this <hi>Decorum,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Deco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, Steadi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Moderation.</note> that Illustrates Life, gains upon all those we converse with, by the Order, Stea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diness, and Moderation of all our Words, and Deeds. Wherefore there should a Certain reverence be used toward all men, both high, and low; for 'tis the humour of an Arrogant and dissolute Man, not to care what the World says of him. But there's a great dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference betwixt <hi>Iustice,</hi> and <hi>Modesty,</hi> upon all Accounts. It belongs to <hi>Iustice</hi> not to <hi>wrong</hi>
               <pb n="53" facs="tcp:42735:35"/>
men; and to <hi>Modesty,</hi> not to <hi>offend</hi> them: Wherein the Power, and Virtue of a <hi>Deco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,</hi> does most eminently appear. This is enough said, I suppose, to make it understood, what is intended by that which we call a <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE Duty that proceeds from it, is chiefly to preserve our selves in a Conformity to Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;<note place="margin">A Decorum in a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to Nature.</note> A Guide That will never mislead us; but conduct those that follow her, to all acute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and perspicacity of Understanding; to the best means of Uniting men in Society; to That which is Strong, and Manly.

            <p>THE <hi>Force,</hi> and <hi>Nature,</hi> of the <hi>Mind,</hi> is <hi>Two-fold: One part</hi> is plac'd in the <hi>Appetite</hi>;<note place="margin">From the Appetite ari<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

As <hi>Affricanus</hi> did yet Augment and Illustrate the Honour of his <hi>Military Knowledge</hi> by his <hi>Particular Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence.</hi> And so did <hi>Timotheus,</hi> the Son of <hi>Conon,</hi> who being a <hi>Captain</hi> not inferior to his <hi>Father,</hi> made himself yet greater by the Addition of <hi>Letters</hi> and <hi>Vnderstanding.</hi> But it happens sometimes that the Son declines the Imitation of the Father, and betakes himself rather to some Course, or design of his own; which is a thing often found in men of large minds, that are descended from obscure Parents. All these Circumstances must be taken into Consideration, in the question of <hi>This Decorum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE First point in Deliberation is This, what it is that we design either to <hi>Be,</hi> or to <hi>do</hi>; and what Course of Life to take to.<note place="margin">Some Course of Life must be pitched upon.</note> In this Deliberation, there is great hazard, and difficulty. For it is in our Youth, that we are to resolve, and pitch upon the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition we propound; at which time, we are least able to judge of it. So that we are commonly engag'd in some certain purpose of Life, before we are able to distinguish betwixt a Better and a worse. For although (according to the Report of <hi>Prodicus,</hi> out of <hi>Xenophon</hi>) so soon as ever <hi>Hercules</hi> came out
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:42735:40"/>
of his <hi>Minority</hi> (the time for every man to choose what Course of Life he will Steer) he retir'd into a <hi>Solitude,</hi> and upon the Sight of <hi>Two ways,</hi> the <hi>One,</hi> of <hi>Virtue,</hi> and the <hi>Other</hi> of <hi>Pleasure,</hi> he sat a long time considering with himself, which of the Two ways he should take: Yet this might do well enough for <hi>Hercules,</hi> that was the Son of <hi>Iupiter,</hi> but not for us, I fear, that commonly follow those men still that we like best; and take up an affection for Their ways, and Studies. And yet for those that are trained up un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Institution of their Parents; they do commonly and insensibly contract an Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection for the Methodes and Customs of their Education. Others are carried away by the Stream of Popular practice; esteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing That still to be the Best; that pleases the <hi>most.</hi> And yet some there are, that lead the Course of Life they ought to do; induced thereunto, either by Providence; a certain Felicity, or Goodness of Nature; a Virtuous Inclination, or some particular advantage of their Institution: But it is a very rare thing to find a Concurrence of Eminent Wit, and Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; or to find Either of them, with so much Time for deliberation, as is needful for the Election of a profitable Course of Life. In this deliberation, a regard must be had to That which is most proper, and Natural to every particular: For (as is already said) since in whatever we do, we must enquire into every mans particular <hi>Genius,</hi> before we can say what becomes him; so we must be more Careful yet, in the Establishment of our Own
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:42735:41"/>
Lives, to see that we maintain an Equality in the Main; and that we never differ from our selves, or falter in our Duty.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Nature and Fortune to be consulted what course of Life.</note>BUT since <hi>Nature</hi> has the <hi>greatest</hi> power in <hi>This Case</hi>; and <hi>Fortune,</hi> the <hi>next</hi>; we must consult them <hi>Both</hi>; what Course of Life to fix upon; But <hi>Nature,</hi> in the <hi>first place:</hi> For She is much Firmer, and more Constant; and it is not for <hi>Fortune,</hi> that is <hi>Frail</hi> and <hi>Mortal,</hi> to contend with <hi>Immortal Nature:</hi> Whosoever therefore shall Conform, in the Ordering of his Life, to the Inclinations of an uncorrupted Nature, must keep constantly to that Tenour, which is the <hi>Decorum</hi> of Life; unless he find himself mistaken in his Choice. And in That Case (for it is a Case to be put) there must be a Change admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of Purposes and Manners. And That change will be more easily and commodiously wrought, under the favour of Times and Occasions: But where the Season is not fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable, it must be Introduc'd by Little and Little; as Wise men say of Inconvenient, and Ill Grounded Friendships; 'tis better to unstitch then to tear them all to pieces on a sodain. But when we have once alter'd our Course, we must be infinitely Careful to make it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, that we have done it upon good, and weighty Reasons. Now whereas I have, (in what is aforesaid) propounded the Imitation of our Predecessors; let me not be thought to advise an Imitation of them in their Vices: beside that there are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things wherein Nature is not to be Imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated.

            <p>BUT this Gracefulness shews it self in all our Words, and Deeds,<note place="margin">The Deco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum of the Body.</note> nay in the very Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and Postures, of the body; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists principally in Beauty, Order, and a kind of Air, or Agreement suitable to every thing we do.

            <p>NATURE has undoubtedly taken great Care in the forming of Mans Body,<note place="margin">The Seeds of Modesty are in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</note> exposing only Those parts to sight, that are Beautiful, Comly, and Agreeable to the Eye: and keeping Those parts conceal'd, and Cover'd, which would give Offence if they were laid open to View; and serve us only for Unclean, and Common Necessities. There is no question, but the Modesty of the Mind conforms it self, in this particular, to the exquisite fabrique of the
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:42735:43"/>
Body; For whatsoever Nature has conceal'd, all men in their right Wits, do naturally keep out of sight, and as private as possible, in Compliance with their very Necessities. Now for Those parts of the body which are of most necessary use to man; we neither call the part, nor the use of it, by the proper Name; and that which may be honestly done, (if se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly) we cannot so much as honestly name. Insomuch, that those things cannot be done openly without Impudence: nor so much as mention'd, without obscenity. Wherefore there's no hearkning to the <hi>Ciniques,</hi>

But we are to follow Nature, and to fly whatsoever may offend either the Eye, or the Ear of a Modest man.

In all This, there are <hi>Two things</hi> we should <hi>beware</hi> of. The <hi>One,</hi> not to do any thing that is <hi>Loose, Nice,</hi> and <hi>Effeminate</hi>; The <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> to <hi>void</hi> things that look <hi>Harsh, Rough,</hi>
               <pb n="69" facs="tcp:42735:43"/>
and <hi>Vncivil.</hi> For why should That which <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes</hi> an <hi>Orator,</hi> or a <hi>Comedian, misbeseem us?</hi> The Discipline of the <hi>Theatre</hi> has a long time had such a regard to <hi>Modesty</hi>;<note place="margin">The Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty of the <hi>Romans.</hi>

            <p>OF <hi>Beauty,</hi> or <hi>Agreeableness,</hi> there are <hi>Two Kinds</hi>; the <hi>One</hi> is matter of <hi>Gracefulness</hi>; the <hi>Other,</hi> of <hi>Dignity</hi>;<note place="margin">Of Dignity and Grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness.</note> and we may call them <hi>Male,</hi> and <hi>Female:</hi> It is not for a man to be Trickt out with <hi>Fooleries</hi>; or to have any thing that is <hi>Phantastical,</hi> or <hi>Effeminate</hi>; no, not so much as in his very <hi>Motion,</hi> or <hi>Gesture.</hi> How are we disgusted many times,<note place="margin">Affectation is Odious.</note> at the Conceipted actions of <hi>Stage-Players?</hi> And the more Odious, and affected Motions of Wrastlers? And yet we Commend that which is Natural, and Simple, both in the One, and in the Other. The dignity of the Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance is Maintein'd by a good Colour: and That Colour by the Exercise of the Body; and to all This we should keep our selves <hi>Neat</hi> and <hi>Cleanly</hi>; not to the degree of <hi>Nice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> and <hi>Affectation,</hi> but only so, as not to incur the censure of <hi>Rudeness, Sluttery,</hi> and <hi>Neglect.</hi> And the same Rule we should ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve in our <hi>Garments:</hi> In which particular,

               <note place="margin">Of Familiar Discourse.</note> the Followers of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi> are most worthy of Imitation.

Nor would I have any man take possession of a Common Right, in such sort as to Talk all himself, to the Exclusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Others; but in Discourse, as in Other things, every man to take his Turn. The First thing to be heeded, is the subject Matter of the Discourse.<note place="margin">Cautious.</note> If serious, it must be seriously handled; if Matter of Mirth, a Freedom of Raillery, and Lightness, does well enough with it. But above all things, we must be be Careful in the government of our Speech, not to discover any Vice, or Defect in our Manners; wherein a man is most liable to betray himself, when he talks spitefully of the Absent; and either in Jest, or in Earnest, maliciously exposes them to Contumely, and Reproach. The Ordinary matter of <hi>Familiar Discourse,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Subject of it.</note> is either about <hi>Domestique Affairs,</hi> the <hi>Republique,</hi> or matter of <hi>Studies,</hi> and <hi>Learning.</hi> If at any time we pass These Bounds, we must as soon as may be take up again.

And then, as we begin a discourse upon Reason, we must not continue it beyond Measure. But as it is laid down upon very good Grounds, and as a general Rule, that we should keep our felves Clear from Perturbations, or vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent

We should be very Careful also in our Conversation, to possess the Company with an Opinion of the Reverence,<note place="margin">Respectful.</note> and Good will that we have for them. There are many Occasions wherein we cannot avoid Chiding; and we may be allow'd sometime, a more then ordinary Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of Voice;<note place="margin">Let Reproof be without Anger.</note> and a sharper severity of Words; but yet This is not to be done nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as if we were Angry; but we are to proceed to this kind of Reproof, as we do to <hi>Laming,</hi> and <hi>Scarifying, rarely,</hi> and <hi>unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly</hi>; nor ever at all, but upon <hi>Necessity,</hi> and for want of some other way of Remedy; but not in Anger still upon any Terms; for it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver does any thing either well or wisely; And yet it may do well enough to use a Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, and a mild way of Rebuke; but still accompany'd with Gravity, that the repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension may be apply'd without Reproach: It must be also signifi'd that the Only Thing intended by the Reproof, was the Amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of him that suffers it. Nay, it will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come us in our differences, even with our greatest Enemies; in despite of all Indigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties yet, to preserve a Gravity; to keep our selves free from Passion; for whatsoever we do in distemper, can neither be well done in it self, nor approved by those that are Witnesses to the doing it.

I have been told of <hi>Cn.

The Former brought the Consulship first into his Family; and the Latter, (tho' the Son of an Eminent, and famous Person, and the House enlarged) brought into it, not only a Repulse, but Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery and Shame. It does well to have the Dignity of the Master yet further adorned by House;<note place="margin">Fit the House to to the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster.</note> but not that Dignity to be fetch'd alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether from it. The House should be grac'd by the Master, and not the Master by the House; and it is in a House, as it is in Other Cases: a man must have a respect, not only to himself, but also to Others. In the House of a Person of Eminent Condition, where many Guests, are to be received, and men of all sorts to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted;
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:42735:46"/>
there must great Care be taken that it be Large Enough: But a large house, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out People, disparages the Master of it; and especially if it has been more frequented un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a Former Possessor; for 'tis an Odious Thing to have Passengers reflect upon it, and say (as in these Times there's too much Occasion) <hi>Here's the</hi> Old House, <hi>but where's the</hi> Old Master? I would have him that sets upon Building, take special Care not to lash out into Magnificence, and Expence,<note place="margin">Keep the Expence within Compass.</note> as a thing of Ill Consequence, even in the Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; for there are too many Imitators in This Kind, of the doings of Princes. How many have we that Emulate the Splendor of <hi>Lucullus</hi>'s <hi>Villa's,</hi> (his Country-houses;) but where is the man that Emulates his Virtue? There must be a <hi>Meane</hi> observ'd in These things; and that Moderation must be trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd, in all Cases, to the Use, Ornament, and Convenience of Life. But enough of This.</p>
            <p>IN all Undertakings there are three things to be observ'd.<note place="margin">Three Rules for all Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakings.</note> 
               <hi>First,</hi> That we govern our Appetites by <hi>Reason,</hi> which is a sure way to keep us to our Duties. <hi>Secondly,</hi> That we take a right Estimate of our Enterprizes, and allow Time, and Peins, neither more nor less then the matter requires. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That we keep a Measure, even in those things that are matter of Dignity, and Reputation. We cannot do better, then to observe the <hi>Decorum</hi> already spoken of, without moving
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:42735:47"/>
one step beyond it. But the First point is the most Excellent of the Three.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">The <hi>Deco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum</hi> of Place and Time.</note>WE come now to the <hi>Order of Things,</hi> and the <hi>Opportunity of Seasons.</hi> Under this Science is comprehended that which the <hi>Greeks</hi> call <gap reason="foreign">

Now for things which are very gross, as for a man to fall a Singing in a Court of Justice; or to do any thing that is notoriously preposterous, or impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per: These are absurdities so well under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood by all people, that there needs no Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, or Caution, in the Case.

Neither let a man so much deceive himself, as to imagine that the Example of <hi>Socrates,</hi> for the Purpose, or <hi>Aristippus,</hi> in the saying, or doing of any ill thing against Rules of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, must presently authorize him to the same Licence: For This Liberty, in those Great and Divine men,<note place="margin">Great Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues are a Privilege to some Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stakes.</note> we are to look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as a privilege purchas'd by their Virtues. Now for the <hi>Cyniques</hi> (those Enemies of <hi>Shame,</hi> and Consequently of <hi>Honesty,</hi> and <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue</hi>) there's no enduring of them. To Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates, and Persons in Authority, we are to pay all Honour, and Reverence, and so
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:42735:49"/>
likewise to all those worthy Patriots that have spent their Lives in Great, and Honest Actions; and in the service of their Country. We owe a respect also to Grey hairs, and even to Those that are but designed to any Administration in the Government. We must distinguish betwixt a Citizen and a Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and even in a Stranger, betwixt a Private Person, and a Publique. But to summ up all in Word; it is our Duty to Cherish, Maintein, and Preserve Unity,<note place="margin">A General Duty.</note> Peace, and Good Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in Humane Society.</p>
            <p>WE come now to the matter of <hi>Trade,</hi> and <hi>Profit,</hi> which we find to be divided into <hi>Liberal,</hi> (or in Vulgar <hi>English, Creditable</hi>) and <hi>Sordid.</hi> There are some <hi>Painful Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments</hi> that carry along with them a <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Odium</hi>;<note place="margin">Of Trade. Which is either sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did.</note> as that of a <hi>Tax gatherer,</hi> or an <hi>Vsu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer.</hi> These, in the first place, I do not like; and I do also look upon all <hi>Mercenary Dealings,</hi> where we pay for the <hi>Work,</hi> and not for the <hi>Art,</hi> to be <hi>Meane,</hi> and <hi>Ignoble.</hi> The very Price of the <hi>Commodity</hi> is a kind of <hi>Covenanting</hi> for <hi>Slavery.</hi> It is also a <hi>Course Business,</hi> That of a <hi>Retayler,</hi> that only buys in a Lump, to sell again in Parcels: For they get their very Bread commonly by Lying; which is a most Unmanly submission. And so for all <hi>Mecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niques,</hi> they are men of Low, and Vulgar business, and we are not to expect any thing that is Clear, and Generous, from the Shop. I am likewise with <hi>Terence,</hi> no friend to those Trades that Minister to Luxury; as <hi>Fisher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi>
               <note place="margin">And Volup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuary.</note>

nor to the <hi>Voluptuous Arts,</hi> as <hi>Perfumers, Dancing-masters,</hi> and the whole Mistery of <hi>Gaiming.</hi> But for those Professions that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire a greater measure of <hi>Prudence,</hi> and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister <hi>Advantage</hi> in proportion; as <hi>Physique, Architecture,</hi> the furnishing of <hi>Good Instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi>; These are commendable Employments, where they suit with the Condition of him that uses them. And then for <hi>Merchandizing,</hi> the driving of a <hi>petty Trade,</hi> That way, is little better than <hi>Peddling.</hi> But when it comes to be <hi>Large,</hi> and <hi>General,</hi> and to be menag'd back and forward, with <hi>Candor,</hi> and <hi>Credit</hi>:<note place="margin">Or of Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour and Credit.</note> it is no contemptible Application. Nay, on the Contrary, This way of Commerce is highly to be esteem'd; when he that has made his Fortune by it, sits down (not satiated, but) contented; and retires as well from his <hi>Port,</hi> to the <hi>Country,</hi> as he has done many a time from the <hi>Sea</hi> to the <hi>Port,</hi> and there quietly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joys himself, and his Possessions. Of all <hi>Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficial Industry,</hi> Certainly there is not any thing more Agreeable, or more Worthy of a Man of <hi>Honour,</hi> and <hi>Reason,</hi> then the <hi>Culture</hi> and <hi>Emprovement</hi> of the <hi>Earth</hi>; which being a Subject handled at large in our <hi>Cato Major,</hi> we shall refer you thither for your satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p>Here is enough said already upon the <hi>seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral parts</hi> of <hi>Virtue,</hi> and our Duties arising from thence. It remains now to consider in a Case of <hi>two Duties</hi> before us, <hi>which to chuse</hi>:<note place="margin">Of Two Duties, which to Chuse.</note> (a thing that often happens) and of <hi>Two honest Propositions,</hi> which is the <hi>Honester,</hi> is the
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:42735:50"/>
Question: (a Point omitted by <hi>Panaetius.</hi>) For since there is <hi>no Virtue,</hi> but what issues from One of these <hi>four Fountains,</hi> and has a respect either <hi>to Knowledge, Society, Courage,</hi> or <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration</hi>; it must necessarily be, that upon a <hi>Complication</hi> of these <hi>Virtues,</hi> there must like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise ensue a <hi>Competition</hi> of <hi>Duties.</hi> Now it is my <hi>Opinion,</hi> that Mankind is Naturally more concerned in Offices that relate to the <hi>Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi> then in matters that only affect the <hi>Vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing</hi>; which may be thus made out. Take a wise man, that has the World at Will, both for Fortune, and Leisure; let him consider with himself, and comtemplate all things what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever, that are worth the Knowing. He would be yet sick of his Life, for all this, if he were to spend his time wholly in solitude, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Companion.</p>
            <p>The Principal Virtue is (as I have said) That, which the <hi>Greeks</hi> call <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and <hi>Wee, Wisdom.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Wisdom is the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Virtue.</note> But their <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> (or <hi>Prudence</hi>) is quite Another thing; being <hi>the skill of Iudging what we are to do, and what not</hi>: Or of distinguishing betwixt Good and Evil. Whereas <hi>Wisdom</hi> (which we call the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal) <hi>is the Knowledge of things Divine and Humane</hi>: wherein is Comprehended a certain Correspondence betwixt the Gods, and Men, and a Society among Themselves. Now if <hi>This</hi> be the most Eminent <hi>Virtue,</hi> as Certainly it is: So must that likewise be the most Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent <hi>Duty,</hi> which refers to <hi>Community.</hi> For the <hi>Speculation</hi> and <hi>Perception</hi> of things, is but <hi>lame</hi> and <hi>imperfect,</hi> if it be not follow'd with <hi>Action</hi>; which <hi>Action</hi> is best seen, in providing
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:42735:50"/>
for the <hi>Common Benefits</hi> of <hi>Mankind:</hi> And must therefore be reduced to the Subject of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Society; in preference to the naked Understanding of things. And this does eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Good man find to be True, upon his Own Practice, and Observation. For where's the man, that is so transported with a Thirst of Knowledge; or a desire of piercing into the Nature of things, that if he should be call'd upon the sodain, to the Relief of his Country, his Father, or his Friend, that were in danger: Where is the Man (I say) that in the heat and rapture of his most Divine Contemplations, would not quit All, to attend this Duty, even supposing him to be in his Thoughts already numbring the Stars, and taking measure of the Universe? This gives us to understand, that the Osfices of <hi>Iustice,</hi> conducing to the Common Utility of Mankind (then which nothing ought to be dearer to us) are of so much greater importance, then These of <hi>Study,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Justice more va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable than Science.</note> and <hi>Science</hi>; and never was any man so ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up in his Life, and Application, with the search of Knowledge, as not yet to have an Eye to his Duty to the Publique;<note place="margin">Our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try in the first place.</note> and to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult the well-being of Sociable Nature: As we see in the Instance of <hi>Lycias</hi> the <hi>Pythago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rean,</hi> to the <hi>Theban Epaminondas</hi>; and in That of <hi>Pluto,</hi> to <hi>Dion</hi> of <hi>Syracuse:</hi> and divers others that train'd up their Disciples to the Love, Knowledge, and Exercise of Civil Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. And for the service, (if any at all) which I my self have render'd to the <hi>Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique,</hi> I must ascribe it to my Masters, and to my Books, that instructed, and fitted Me for
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:42735:51"/>
my Function. For great men do not only teach the Lovers of Learning during their <hi>Lives</hi>; but in their very <hi>Graves</hi> too: Transmitting their Precepts down to after times, for the Use of Posterity. Now to shew how much Their Leisures contributed to our Business; These Eminent men have not slipt so much as any one point apperteining to the Laws, Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and Discipline of the Commonwealth; but have still, with all their Faculties, apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Fruits of their Labours and Studies, to the well-being of the Publique. So that a Copious Eloquence, joined with Prudence, is much more profitable, then the most refin'd subtilty of <hi>Thought,</hi> without <hi>speaking.</hi> For <hi>Meditation</hi> does only <hi>Circulate</hi> within it self; Whereas <hi>Eloquence</hi> works upon <hi>Others,</hi> and Insinuates it self into the Affections of all that Hear it. We must not imagine that <hi>Bees</hi> ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther into Swarms, upon a design to make their <hi>Cells,</hi> but it is in their Nature to <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregate,</hi> and then they work their <hi>Combs.</hi> And so it is with <hi>Men,</hi> who are much more So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciable by Nature; when they are gotten to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, they Consult their Common business. Now for That Virtue (of <hi>Iustice</hi>) which provides for the Defence, and Conservation of Men in Society; if it be not accompanied with the <hi>Vnderstanding</hi> of Things, it is but <hi>so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary,</hi> and <hi>Fruitless.</hi> And what is <hi>Courage,</hi> without the softness of Humane <hi>Courtesie,</hi> and <hi>Candour,</hi> but a <hi>Savage,</hi> and <hi>Outrageous Brutality</hi>? From hence we may infer the Excellency of a <hi>Practical Iustice,</hi> in the Ordering of <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind</hi>; above the force, and effect of a <hi>Specu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:42735:51"/>
Notion.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Leagues are more for Society then Defence.</note> There are fome people that Phansie all Leagues and Associations amongst men, to arise from the need that one man has for another, toward the supplying of our Natural, and Common Necessities: because (say They) if Providence had deliver'd us from This Care of Looking after Food, and Cloathing, by appointing some Extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry way for the furnishing of it; no man, of either Brains, or Virtue, would ever trouble his head about Business; but wholly deliver himself up to the attaining of Wisdom. But This is a mistake: For even in That Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, a man would fly Solitude, and wish for a Companion in his very Studies: he would be willing to Teach, and to Learn; to Hear, and to Speak. So that beyond question, the Duties that defend, and support men in So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, are more to be esteem'd then those, that barely relate to Learning, and Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</p>
            <p>IT may be another Question whether <hi>This Community</hi> which is so Consonant to Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,<note place="margin">Justice and Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd.</note> be in all Cases to be preferr'd to <hi>Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty,</hi> and <hi>Moderation.</hi> Now I think Not. For there are some things, partly so foul, and in part so flagitious, that a wise man (even if it were to save his Country) would not be guilty of them. <hi>Posidonius</hi> has made a large Collection of such Cases: But so filthy, so obscene, that a man cannot honestly repeat them. Now why should any man do that for the saving of his Country, which his Country it self would rather perish, that any
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:42735:52"/>
member of it should do? But however, this is the best on't; that it can never be for the Interest of the <hi>publique,</hi> to have a wise man do any such thing. Let it be therefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, that of All Duties we are to prefer those that tend toward the Mainteining of Society. For a <hi>Considerate Action presumes an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent Cognition, and Wisdom.</hi> So that it is more to <hi>Do Considerately,</hi> then to <hi>Think Wisely.</hi> But let This suffice; for the matter is made so plain, that there will be no difficulty to resolve upon <hi>Two Duties</hi> in <hi>question,</hi> which to <hi>Chuse.</hi> But then in the Community it self, there are several Degrees of Duties, in sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordination one to another.<note place="margin">D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>on <hi>Marcus</hi>) that we proceed upon some certain sorts of Duty, that have a regard to the splendor and Ornament of Life: As to Riches, Power; and a Competent provision of things Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious for the Use of Man. The matter in question was, (as I told you) <hi>First,</hi> what is <hi>Profitable,</hi> and what <hi>not.

<pb n="88" facs="tcp:42735:53"/>
before I enter upon the Discourse it self, I must give you a word or two of my Purpose, and Intention.</p>
            <p>THERE are a great many I know that have been excited, by My Books, to the Love of Letters:<note place="margin">The Intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction.</note> And to the love, not only of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, but of Writing also: And yet Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy has gotten so Ill a Name in the World, (verily with some good men too) that I am afraid sometimes, of hazzarding my Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit with them; for bestowing so much Time, and Labour, upon This Study. But truely, for my Own part, so long as the Management of Publique Affairs past thorough those hands, to which the Commonwealth had deliver'd up it self: All my Thoughts, and Cares were directed That way. But when One man came to Grasp all, and that there was no longer Any place for Authority, or Counsel, (those Publique-spirited men being gone too, that had been my Partners in the Charge of the Government) It was not for me, either on the One hand, to abandon my self to an Anxious, and irksome Melancholy; or, on the other, to plunge my self into Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, below the Dignity of my Profession. Oh! that the Republique might have conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nu'd still in the Former state, without falling into those hands; that sought, not so much the Change of Affairs, as the Total Ruine of them. For if the Commonwealth were Now standing, I should be doing at this instant just as I did before. First, my Bus'ness would lie more at the Bar, then in my Study; and
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:42735:53"/>
Secondly, I should now be setting down my Pleadings, as formerly, instead of these Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals: But since the Dissolution of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, that took up all my Cares, my Thoughts, my Studies; There's no more Law, or Senate-Imployment. Matters being brought to This Pass, (and 'tis not for any man that has a Soul, to sit still, and do nothing) What could I better do, then to betake my self to my Philosophy; My First <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>tudy, and the most Innocent, the Honestest Diversion of my Troubles? It was the Institution of my Youth; and I spent a great deal of Time upon't: Till I came afterward to push my Fortune in the World, for Offices, and Prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; and Then I dedicated my self wholly to the Government: But still reserving Those hours for Philosophy, which I had to spare from the Publique, and my Friends; and Those very hours were spent in Reading too: for I had no Leisure to Write. The Calamity of those Times was Extreme: and yet we have drawn This Benefit from it, that we are now at Liberty to commit those things to Letters, which our Countrymen were very little ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with, tho' in themselves infinitely worth the Knowing. For (<hi>in the name of all the Gods!) What is more desirable then</hi> Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom? <hi>more Excellent; more useful to a man? or what more worthy of him</hi>?<note place="margin">The Praise of <hi>Philosophy.</hi>
               </note> We call the Lovers of it, <hi>Philosophers,</hi> from the very <hi>Etymon</hi> of the word: For <hi>Philosophy,</hi> by Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation, is only <hi>the Love of Wisdom.</hi> The Antients defin'd it to be <hi>the Science of things Divine and Humane; and of their Causes.</hi> What

will any man speak well of, I wonder, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches this Study? If he seeks either the Delight of his Mind, or the Allaying of his Cares, this is the Study that does it Incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably above all others: For it furnishes him, every day, with something or other, toward Atteining, and Enjoying a Virtuous, and a Happy Life. If Virtue, or an Unshaken Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy, be his Bus'ness, it is either to be Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passed This way, or not at all.

               </gap>n toward the acquiring of it: And shall any man be so mad Then, as to think that there needs none toward the most Important Acquisition of our Lives? But if there be any Discipline of Virtue, where shall we look for it; if we depart from This way of finding it out? This Question, as it falls properly under another <hi>Topique,</hi> So we have handled it in another place; and more accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately too; That is to say, in our Exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to Philosophy. My present purpose is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to set forth, that having nothing any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to do, in the Government, I made Choice of This Subject for my Private Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. But I must expect to be Here encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd, and that by some of the Learned too, with a Charge of Contradicting my self. For how does it consist,<note place="margin">An Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</note> say they, the entring up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Disputes,</hi> and delivering <hi>Precepts</hi> of <hi>Duty,</hi> as things <hi>Certain</hi>; and yet at the same time, to maintein that we have <hi>no certain Knowledge of any thing</hi>? I should be glad to be a little better understood; For I am none of those Roving, Wandring heads, that Live, and Live
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:42735:54"/>
on; without proposing to themselves any Scope, or Design. How Miserable were That mans mind, or rather his Life, that should be debarr'd the Use of his Reason, not only in the matter of Argument, but in the main End of his Being? Now for those Points which Others Divide, into <hi>Certain,</hi> and <hi>Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain</hi>; it pleases me better, that they should be <hi>distinguished</hi> by calling them <hi>Probable,</hi> or <hi>Improbable.</hi> And what should hinder me now from Embracing the One, and disallowing the Other? provided that I keep my self from being either Arrogantly positive; or Rash, and Inconsiderate; Two qualities that hold no fellowship with Wisdom. But our people, on the Other side, will Dispute every thing: For (say they) without Comparing <hi>Both parts,</hi> how shall any man know which is the <hi>Right</hi>? But This matter (I suppose) is sufficiently clear'd, in our <hi>Academical Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi> Now for You, (my Son) tho' you have been train'd up in the most Ancient, and Noble sort of Philosophy, and under the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution of <hi>Cratippus</hi>; (an Author not inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our to the most Venerable Founders of it) I would not have you a Stranger yet to your Fathers Writings, which you will not find much differing from your Own.

of the Quarries for our necessary use: or Iron, Brass, Gold, Silver, out of the Bowels of the Earth, without Labour, and the Hands of men? whence came our Houses, at First, to defend us from the Injuries of Heat and Cold? or How should we afterward have Repaired, or Rebuilt them, when they come to be laid in Ruines, either by Tempest, Earthquakes, or even by Age it self: If the Obligations and Necessities of Humane Societies, had not mov'd us to call for Help, one of another? Our <hi>Aquaducts</hi> our <hi>Canals</hi> for the turning of Rivers, and flowing of our Grounds, our Sea Banks, our forced Ports, and Harbours, are they not all of them the Effect of Manual Operation and Industry? From these Instances, and a thousand more, it appears undenyably that the very advantages which we receive even from Inanimate things would be totally lost to us; but for That Labour and Endeavor that gives us Profit of them: and to which we are like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise indebted for the Benefits that we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive even from Beasts themselves. It was undoubtedly the Invention of man too; the Application of them to the Use of Mankind; Nor can we at this day either Feed, Reclaim, or Preserve what we have occasion for, or make our Best of their Service<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> without the Assistance of one another. Is it not by the help of Men, that we destroy those Creatures that are hurtful to us; and take others, that we may be the better for?

This is it that furnishes, and Sweetens Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Life; and in our manner of Feeding, and Covering, raises us above the Condition of Beasts. How should <hi>Cities</hi> have been either <hi>built,</hi> or <hi>peopled</hi> without <hi>Correspondence,</hi> and <hi>Commerce</hi>?

A great deal of this might have been spar'd; For it is Clear to every man, That which <hi>Panaetius</hi> has so much enlarg'd upon; Which is, that never any Prince or General, either in War, or in Peace, atchiev'd any Great, and Profitable Exploit, without the Concurrence of Humane Aid.

               </gap>, and subjecting them to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of Reason. The <hi>Third,</hi> is, the Skill of menaging our <hi>Conversation</hi> with so much <hi>Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesie,</hi> and <hi>Discretion,</hi> as to gain the kindness and assistance of our Acquaintance, toward the furnishing of us with all things that our

Nature requires, in Competency, and Plenty; Defending, and Protecting us from Violence, revenging our selves upon those that affront us, by inflicting such punishments only as may stand with Humanity, and Justice. As to the Means, and Faculty both of Making Friends, and Keeping them, (which we shall speak of in due Time, and Place) only a Word, in Passage.</p>
            <p>We are all of us sensible of the Power of <hi>Fortune,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Power of Fortune.</note> in the matter of <hi>Prosperity,</hi> and <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity:</hi> When she gives us a fair Gale, our Course is smooth, and gentle; till we arrive at our desired Port. But when the Wind blows strong against us, we are fain to beat it out, under a thousand hazards. Now there are some Casualties,<note place="margin">Unhappy Casualties.</note> less frequent, then Others; which are commonly ranged under the Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of <hi>Fortune. First,</hi> from things <hi>Inanimate,</hi> as <hi>Storms, Tempests, Shipwracks, Ruines; Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flagrations</hi>; from <hi>Beasts,</hi> as <hi>Stroaks, Bitings, Trampling under foot,</hi> &amp;c. These are <hi>Accidents,</hi> as I said, that fall not out <hi>often.</hi> But the Routing of <hi>Armies</hi>; (as of no less than Three lately:) the Loss of <hi>Brave Commanders,</hi> (one Incomparable Person but the Other Day) the <hi>Envy</hi> of the <hi>Multitude,</hi> and a World of Gallant, and Deserving Men, by <hi>Prescriptions, Imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> and <hi>forced Escapes,</hi> sacrific'd to <hi>Popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Malice:</hi> And on the <hi>Other Side, Honours, Empire, Victory</hi>; tho' these things are All Look'd upon as <hi>Fortuitous</hi>; yet neither the <hi>One,</hi> nor the <hi>Other</hi> come to pass, without the Interposition of Labour, and Industry. Now since thus it is; let us consider by what fair

Means we may make such Interests, and Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships in the World, as may turn to our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage.

Only something must be said in the First place, of Those Things that have a Nearer Affinity with Virtue. There are se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Reasons for which One Man puts himself under the <hi>Power,</hi> and <hi>Government</hi> of <hi>Another</hi>; Either <hi>Affection, Obligations, Excellency of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowments, Hope of Profit; Fear</hi> of being <hi>forc'd</hi>

            <p>THERE is nothing that <hi>secures Power,</hi> and <hi>Greatness,</hi> like <hi>Love</hi>;<note place="margin">Love is the best Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Power.</note> Nothing that <hi>endangers</hi> it, like <hi>Fear.</hi> Wherefore <hi>Ennius</hi> says very well, <hi>He that is Fear'd, is Hated; and they that hate a Man, wish him Dead.</hi> But when it comes once to a <hi>General Hatred,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Hatred is the certain effect of Fear.</note> there is no force that is able to encounter it: As We have found by late, and dear Experience, even if the thing had been unknown to us before. And it is not only in the Violent Death of That <hi>Tyrant, Caesar,</hi> (whom this Oppressed City was forc'd to bear, for want of Power to make Resistance:) But we may read it also in the Common Fate of Other Oppressours; scarce any of them coming to a Natural End. <hi>Fear</hi> is a <hi>False,</hi> and <hi>short-liv'd Security</hi>; but <hi>Love,</hi> on the Contrary, and <hi>Benevolence,</hi> are Firm, even to the <hi>Death.</hi> In the Case of a <hi>Conquer'd People,</hi> I must confess, if nothing else will keep them in Order; I should advise the same Rigour, and Authority to be exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis'd over them, that a <hi>Master</hi> uses over his <hi>Servants.</hi> But for any Man to persue the same Course in a <hi>Free City,</hi> of making himself <hi>Fear'd,</hi> were a direct Madness.

Let us therefore imbrace That which most Conduces, not only to our <hi>Security,</hi> but also to <hi>Wealth,</hi> and <hi>Power.</hi> The Ready way to the attaining of our Desires, either in Publique Affairs; or in Private, is, to Cast out Fear, and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve, and maintain Charity. For whosoever would be Fear'd, must necessarily be afraid himself of all that are afraid of him. What shall we think of the Condition of the <hi>First Dionysius,</hi>

And to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to my Subject, all these Calamities are fallen upon us, for making it our bus'ness ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be Fear'd, than Belov'd.

            <p>TO speak in Order now, to the three Points before mentioned; Nothing works so much upon the Affections of the People, as <hi>Libera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi> or <hi>Bounty.</hi>

There is such a Charm in That <hi>Gracefulness</hi> and <hi>Decorum,</hi> which we have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready Treated of, that the very Nature, and
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:42735:62"/>
bare Appearance of it does move us strangely. Beside that as it receives its Lustre from the aforesaid Virtues; wherever we find those Virtues, we cannot but naturally have a good Inclination for the person that possesses them. These are the most powerful attractives of Love. Not but that there may be other motives also, tho' of less moment.</p>
            <p>AS to the Matter of <hi>Trust</hi> and <hi>Credit</hi>; if we can but get the Reputation of being <hi>Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent</hi> and <hi>Iust,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Power of Justice &amp; Prudence.</note> our Bus'ness is done: For we have naturally a Confidence in those that we think Wiser then our selves; In men of <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,</hi> and <hi>Foresight,</hi> upon whom we may depend for our seasonable direction, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice; as those that in Case of any difficulty, are able to help us out. This is the True, and Profitable <hi>Wisdom</hi>: As to the <hi>Trust</hi> now which we repose in <hi>Iust, Good,</hi> and <hi>Faithful</hi> Men; we must not entertain so much as the least suspicion in it, of Fraud, or Injury; These being the men into whose hands we do reasonably commit our Lives, our Children, and our Fortunes. But it is <hi>Iustice</hi> yet, that creates the greater Confidence of the Two: For <hi>Iustice</hi> may beget <hi>Confidence,</hi> without <hi>Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi>; but <hi>Wisdom</hi> can do nothing without <hi>Iustice.</hi> For take away the Opinion of a mans <hi>Integrity,</hi> and the more <hi>Crafty,</hi> and <hi>Subtle</hi> he is, by so much is he the more <hi>Hateful,</hi> and <hi>Suspected. Iustice,</hi> and <hi>Prudence</hi> in <hi>Conjunction,</hi> will give a man what <hi>Credit</hi> he pleases; but taking them <hi>Apart, Iustice,</hi> even without <hi>Wisdom,</hi> may do very much;
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:42735:63"/>
but <hi>Wisdom,</hi> without <hi>Iustice,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Wisdom without Justice, is Craft.</note> is nothing Worth. Let not any man wonder now at my divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding One Virtue from Another, as if it were possible for a man to be <hi>Iust,</hi> and yet not <hi>Prudent</hi>; when the Philosophers are all agreed upon't (and my self too for one) that he that has one Virtue, has All. For it is One thing, the Nicety of hitting a Truth in a Philosophical Decision; and another thing to make a Discourse in Words accommodated to Vulgar acceptation: And That's my In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent in this place, when I say that one is <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant,</hi> another <hi>Good,</hi> a third <hi>Wise.</hi> For these are popular Opinions, and must be clothed in Common and Popular Terms; which was also <hi>Panaetius</hi>'s way of expressing himself. But to resume my Purpose.</p>
            <p>THE Third point recommended toward the acquiring of Glory, is This: So to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have our selves that people may hold us in Admiration, and accompt us Worthy of all honour. The Common people are General<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly admirers of all things that are Great,<note place="margin">A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But where they Phansie any Virtues Peculiar, and Extraordinary, they extol men to the Skies, and behold them with a kind of Veneration, despising, and villifying such, on the Other side, as they find wanting either in Virtue, Strength, or Courage. But they cannot yet be said to <hi>Despise</hi> all that they have an <hi>Ill Opinion</hi> of. For there is a Lewd, Backbiting,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:42735:63"/>
Couzening, Quarrelsom Generation of men, which tho' they do exceedingly <hi>Dislike,</hi> they do not yet <hi>Contemn</hi>: For those Only are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly to be taken for <hi>Contemptible,</hi> that lead a <hi>Lazy, Droning, Heedless Life</hi>; without any Benefit, either to Themselves, or Others. The Admirable Spirits are such as have the Repute of a Preeminence in Virtue;<note place="margin">Great Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces great Admirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> and keep themselves not only from doing Mean and Dishonourable things, but clear even of those Vices, which others cannot easily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist.

               </gap> Charms of Pleasures our Minds are Dissolv'd, and withdrawn from Virtue; And we are as much discomposed and shaken, on the the other hand, with the Burnings, and Tortures of Pein. It is a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious power that the Consideration of Life and Death, Riches and Poverty, has over the Weakness of Flesh and Bloud.

               </gap> Virtue constitutes the very Character of a <hi>Good man</hi>; and makes him wonderful in the Eyes of the People; and not without reason neither: For no man can be <hi>Iust,</hi> that either Fears <hi>Death, Pein, Banishment,</hi> or <hi>Poverty</hi>; Or that Values be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Equity,</hi> the Comforts that stand oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed

               <note place="margin">Contempt of mony.</note> And wheresoever they find such a man, they think they can never do enough for him.

            <p>NOW in my Opinion, there is not any Design or Condition of Life wherein one man does not stand in need of Another; And es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially, as to the matter of <hi>Familiar Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,</hi> and <hi>Conversation</hi>: which a body shall hardly find to his satisfaction, but under the appearance of an <hi>honest man.</hi> Nay, the very <hi>Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion</hi> of <hi>Iustice</hi> will stand a man in great stead,<note place="margin">The very Opinion of <hi>Iustice</hi> gives a man Reputation.</note> even in the strictest solitude, and retirement imaginable; and more perhaps in That State, then in any other, as living, in some sort, out of Protection; and more exposed to Affronts; which, under the Notion of an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious person, people will be forward enough to put upon him: And then for men of <hi>Bus'ness</hi> and <hi>Commerce,</hi> as Buying, Selling, Hiring, Letting<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> there can be no dealing without <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice.</hi>

But how easily soever we may make our selves known to Others for what we are, (tho' in truth the main point rests in being such Men, as we would be thought to be) it will not be amiss yet to lay down some Certain Precepts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this Matter.

            <p>THE First Lesson that I would give to a <hi>Young Man</hi> for the Advance of his Credit with the People;<note place="margin">Let a Young Man study the Use of his Arms.</note> should be to addict himself to the Study, and Practice, of <hi>Arms</hi>; at least where there were any <hi>Glory</hi> to be gotten by <hi>Military Virtues.</hi> Our Predecessors, that were almost Continually in War; made themselves Famous by This Profession: But it has been Your Lot (my Son) to come into the World amid the Broyls of a Divided State, where the One side was Extreamly Wicked, and the Other as Unfortunate.

But it does not follow yet, because we must not upon any terms persecute the Innocent, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we may not in some Case defend the Wicked, and the Guilty: For it is a thing many times agreeable to the Will of the People; to Custom, and to Humanity, so to do.

               <pb n="117" facs="tcp:42735:68"/>HAVING already set forth the Methods by which a Young man may advance his <hi>Reputation</hi> in the World; we shall now discourse the matter of <hi>Liberality,</hi> and <hi>Bounty,</hi> which is <hi>Twofold</hi>; For we oblige those that stand in need of our Help, either by our <hi>Labour,</hi> or by our <hi>Mony.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Liberality is Twofold, Labour and Money.</note> The <hi>Latter</hi> is the <hi>Easier</hi> way; es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially where the <hi>Benefactor</hi> is Master of an <hi>Estate</hi>; but the <hi>Other</hi> is the more <hi>Honorable,</hi> and <hi>Splendid,</hi> and better becoming a Clear and Generous Mind. For tho' the Will may be Frank enough in Both, yet the one Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation is rather a Debt to his <hi>Fortune,</hi> but the other to his <hi>Virtue.</hi> And then by These Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuniary Bounties, the very Fountein is drawn dry, and one Bounty is destroy'd by Another; and in the very Act, we lose the Means of Obliging.

                  </gap>,</hi> and <hi>Virtue,</hi> the more Good he has done already, the more Friends will he find to assist him toward the doing of more: And then by the Custom and Practice of doing good Offices a man does not only learn the <hi>Way</hi> of <hi>Obliging,</hi> but gets the very <hi>Habit</hi> of it. It is a Notable Reprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, that of <hi>Philip,</hi>
               <note place="margin">A Generous Reproof.</note> in a Letter to his Son <hi>Alexander,</hi> for endeavouring to ingratiate himself with the <hi>Macedonians</hi> by the Force of <hi>Mony, What is it, (with a mischief</hi>) says he, <hi>that should make you expect Faith from those People whom you your self have Corrupted? Is it that instead of their Prince, you would be lookt upon only as their Servant, or Purse-bearer?</hi> An Office so much below the Dignity of
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:42735:69"/>
a Monarch! Such a Bounty could not have been better exprest, then by calling it a Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption: For the very Receiver is the worse for't, and the more he gets, the more he looks for. This Epistle was written only to his Son; but it may serve as a Precept to Mankind.</p>
            <p>NOW as there is no question, but that the Bounty which consists in <hi>Labour,</hi> and <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry</hi> is the <hi>Fairer</hi> of the two,<note place="margin">The Bounty of Labour is the fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est of the Two.</note> and the more <hi>Extensive,</hi> because more men are the better for't; we meet with several Occasions yet, and many proper Objects for the Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise also of the <hi>Other sort</hi> of <hi>Bounty,</hi> which in some Cases must be put in Practice, but with Choyce, and within Compass:<note place="margin">Give within Compass.</note> For there are many people that squander away their whole Estates upon Inconsiderate Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuities. Nor can any thing be more sense<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less, then for a man to take peins to put himself out of condition to do the thing that he loves to do. And these Unadvised Libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralities are commonly follow'd with Extor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion too; for when men are brought to Want, by Over-giving, they fall to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairing of their <hi>Profusions</hi> upon <hi>Some,</hi> by <hi>Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence</hi> upon <hi>Others</hi>: And the Friends they get by <hi>Giving,</hi> on the <hi>One</hi> side, will not ballance the Enemies they raise, by <hi>taking away</hi> on the <hi>Other.</hi> Wherefore, as I would not lay my Fortune in Common, so neither would I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse a Part of it to my Friend, but still in Proportion to the whole. We have a Common saying which is grown by use into a Proverb, <hi>Bounty has no Bottom,</hi> and it is worth remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring. For what Mean can be There expected,
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:42735:69"/>
where by the Custom of <hi>Giving,</hi> and of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving,</hi> both the <hi>Giver</hi> and the <hi>Receiver</hi> come to desire the <hi>same thing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>OF <hi>large Givers</hi> there are <hi>Two sorts</hi>; the <hi>Liberal,</hi> and the <hi>Prodigal:</hi> The <hi>Prodigal,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Prodigality.</note> they lash out upon Treats, Popular Doales, Prizes, Publique Sports, and Spectacles, and other Entertainments, which are no sooner past, then forgotten. The <hi>Liberal,</hi>
               <note place="margin">True Libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality.</note> they employ their Expences upon Redeeming of Slaves, setting a Friend out of Debt, or helping him out in the bestowing of a Daughter, in the Getting of a Fortune, or in the Encreasing of it. I cannot but wonder what put it into <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrastus</hi>'s head. in his Book of <hi>Riches,</hi> that among so many Excellent things, he should be guilty of one so very gross an Absurdity. His Discourse runs much upon the Honour, and Magnificence of Popular Shews, and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents; and he makes this to be the great Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of an Ample Fortune, that it Furnishes a man with means to be at That Exepnce. Now in my Opinion, the Fruit of Liberality is much more Certain, and Considerable, in the Few Instances I have before mentioned. It is a Grave, and a Pertinent Reproof, that of <hi>Aristotle</hi>'s, upon This Subject: <hi>We make nothing</hi> (says he) <hi>of our Profusions upon the Humouring of the Common People, but to hear of</hi> Ten Crowns <hi>given in a</hi> Siege <hi>for a</hi> Bottle of Water, <hi>what a wonderment is made</hi> of it, as a thing Incredible: till upon second Thoughts, we find the Price excus'd by the Necessity? But in the Other Extravagant Spoil, and Excessive Prodigality, where there is neither
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:42735:70"/>
Honour, nor Necessity Consulted in it, and the very Pleasure passes with the Spectacle; we can find nothing there to wonder at. And who are they but the weakest of the People that stand affected with this Vanity? And no sooner are they satiated, then the Delight it self is forgotten. And who are they that are so much taken with these Fooleries, but Women, Children,<note place="margin">Fine Shews are only for Women and Children.</note> and Slaves; that is to say, people either of ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile Condition, or of servile Minds, scarce any man of Sense, Judgement, or Consideration, approving of them? I know very well that it is an Ancient Custom in This City, for the <hi>AEdile</hi> to exhibit Shews to the People, upon Entering his Office; and that very good men expect it from him. <hi>P. Crassus</hi> the <hi>Rich</hi> (as well in his <hi>Fortune,</hi> as in his <hi>Name</hi>) made a very <hi>Magnificent Entry</hi>; and so did <hi>L. Crassus,</hi> after Him; tho' join'd with <hi>Q. Marius</hi> too, a man of singular Moderation. And then <hi>C. Claudius,</hi> the Son of <hi>Appius,</hi> with a great many more; as <hi>Lucullus, Hortensius, Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanus</hi>; which were all outdone by <hi>P. Len<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulus,</hi> in My Consulship, and <hi>Scaurus</hi> Emula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him. But the most Pompous, and Expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive Solemnity of all, was that of our Friend <hi>Pompey,</hi> in his <hi>Second Consulship</hi>; This is enough to shew you my opinion in all these Cases. But yet however, we must have a Care on the Other hand, not to incur a suspition of <hi>Avarice. Mamercus,</hi> (a very Rich man) was repulsed when he stood for <hi>Consul,</hi>
               <note place="margin">In what Cases Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion may be allowed.</note> because he had refused the Charge of <hi>AEdile.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, if the People call for it, on the One side,
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:42735:70"/>
and wise men be not against it, (tho' they do not desire it) on the Other; the thing ought to be done: But according to our Abilities, as it has been my Own Case: Or otherwise, where we may reap some Advantage by it, that will more then Countervail the Charge. As it turn'd much to the reputation of <hi>Ore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes,</hi> not long since, the publique Dinners that he exposd in the Streets, to the Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, under Colour of Dedicating his Tenths to <hi>Hercules.</hi> Neither did any man blame <hi>M. Seius,</hi> for supplying the people in a great Scarcity with Corn, at about a Groat a Bushel: when by so doing, he delivered himself from the great and inveterate hatred of the Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude; and (being <hi>AEdile</hi> too) by a Libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality, that was neither Dishonorable nor Burthensome. But it was a most Glorious, and Memorable Action my Friend <hi>Milo's</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging of the <hi>Sword-players</hi> for the <hi>Publique safety,</hi> which in my own particular I was not a little concern'd in: And by Means where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, all the Attempts and Outrages of <hi>Claudius</hi> were Crusht, and disappointed. So that Bounties should be grounded either upon Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity or Profit; and even in These Cases too the best Rule is Mediocrity. <hi>L. Philip</hi> the Son of <hi>Quintus,</hi> (a person of great Worth,<note place="margin">But still within Bounds.</note> and Understanding) was want to make it his Vaunt, that it never cost him one penny of Mony to the People, the obteining of all the Favours that were ever conferr'd upon him. <hi>Cotta</hi> said the same thing, and without Vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, so might we our selves too, in some de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree; for the expence of my <hi>AEdileship</hi> was
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:42735:71"/>
so small, that it could not signifie any thing toward the gaining of those Offices which were afterward conferr'd upon me as by a Common Consent; And That in my own year too: which is more then any of those before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named, can boast of. I take that mony to be best laid out which is employed upon Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Walls, and Ramparts, Docks, Havens, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaducts, and other Works, for the good of the Publique. Those Bounties give more of present satisfaction, I must confess, that are laid down upon the Nail, as I may say; but the Other will find better acceptation with Posterity: As for Theatres, Walks, Galleries, Temples, I shall speak the more Favourably of Them, for <hi>Pompey</hi>'s sake: But Learned men, I perceive, do not approve of them; and <hi>Panaetius,</hi> for one, whom in this Discourse I have rather Followed, then Interpreted: and then there is <hi>Phalereus Demetrius,</hi> who was very sharp upon the famous <hi>Pericles,</hi> for his Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant Profusion upon the Porch of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Pallas.</hi> But I have handled this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject at large in my Discourse of a <hi>Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth.</hi> Now for a Conclusion; This kind of <hi>Liberality,</hi> upon the whole matter, is stark naught; and yet by the Circumstances of Times, and the like, it may be render'd Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary; But in all Cases there must be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd a <hi>Mediocrity,</hi> and a <hi>Proportion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AS to the Other sort of <hi>Bounty</hi> that arises from <hi>Liberality,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Of Privater Liberality.</note> we must accommodate our selves to the Occasion, and in Differing Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses use Differing Methods. One man lies un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Pinch of a Pressing Calamity: An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other

And yet I would not be so hard nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as not to help him also, that is Well al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, in order to his Further Advantage; But this is a Point that requires singular Care and Judgment in the Choice. It was well said of <hi>Ennius, A Benefit misplaced turns to a Crime.</hi> But in That which is bestow'd upon a Good, and a Grateful man, there's, First, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scientious Comfort of the Virtue it self; and then the Satisfaction that it brings us in Other respects; For the most acceptable thing in the World is a discreet Liberality; and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of it must needs be great, when the Goodness of every man in Power is the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Sanctuary of Mankind.</p>
            <p>WE must have a regard also to the Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, as well as to the Person;<note place="margin">A Regard to the Benfit as well as to the Person.</note> and that it may be of such a Quality as to Descend in the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of it to the Children and Posterity of the Person Obliged, that there may be no place left for Ingratitude. For all Mortals have a Detestation for it, and every man looks upon himself as Injur'd in the discou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragment of Bounty: And the Guilty in this Case, are reputed the Common Enemies of the Needy. Beside the Benefit that this Piety of Disposition brings to the Publique, in the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riching of the Poor, and the Redeeming of Captives, which, as <hi>Crassus</hi> delivers at large in One of his Orations, was many times the
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:42735:72"/>
Work of the Senate it self. And is not this now a Nobler way of Obliging then the Casting of our mony away upon <hi>Pageantryes,</hi> and <hi>Popular Spectacles?</hi> This is an Expence for a man of Sense, and Honour; whereas the Other is only a Fawning application by Chargeable Fopperies to tickle the Phansies of the Common People.</p>
            <p>AS we are to Oblige with Frankness;<note place="margin">Our Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations should be Frank.</note> so we are not to Exact any thing again with Rigour, but in all our Dealings, as buying, selling, letting, hiring, &amp;c. to behave our selves toward our Neighbor and Acquaintance, with Candor, and Respect; tho' to the preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice sometime of our Own Right: Avoiding Law-Suits as much as may be, and a little more perhaps then needs; For it is not only Generous, but Profitable too, for a man in some Cases to remit somewhat of the strait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of his Just due: But in so doing he must have an Eye yet to his Family, or Estate, which it were Impious not to defend; but in such a manner too, that there appear nothing of Harshness, or Greediness in the Dispute. For a man cannot employ his Mony better, then to do others good with it; with a regard still to the Mainteining of his Own.</p>

But then for those that would make an Honest

Interest abroad in the World, it is a very great Advantage, the Favour, and Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation which they get among Foreign Nations through the Friendship of those they meet with upon This Occasion. <hi>Theophrastus</hi> writing of the Hospitality of <hi>Cimon</hi> of <hi>Athens,</hi> tells us that he gave strict Order to his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants in the Country that his House should be still Open, to whatever <hi>Lacian</hi> (or <hi>Towns<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> of his) past that way.</p>

Wherefore, among the Excellent Qualities of our Fore-fathers, the Knowledge, and Interpretation, as well as the Constitution of the <hi>Civil Law,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the Civil Law.</note> was ever had in great Esteem: And reserved (until This Confusion of Affairs) as a Matter Sacred, in the Possession of Men of Highest Authority and Wisdom.

Now since we cannot be all of us either <hi>Orators,</hi> or <hi>Lawyers,</hi> (having indeed but few great men in either Faculty) we may do a world of good services yet, by Recommending, or Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liciting on the Behalf of Petitioners, or Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents; and by Employing our Interests either with the Bench, or with the Counsel, for their Behoof. Whosoever takes This Course, shall be sure to Oblige a great many men,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:42735:73"/>
and consequently by a great many to be well spoken of. But then we must have a Care (which every man will look to in his Own Discretion) that while we would Oblige One man, we do not Offend Another. For it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens many times that either through Heed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesness,<note place="margin">Disoblige no man.</note> we disoblige some body that does not Deserve it, or out of Rashness-provoke some Other body that may make us rue it. In which Case, we ought to excuse our selves, as well as we can; for the least offence given to any man, even where we never intended it; by shewing him the Inevitable Necessity that forc'd us upon it, and the desire we have, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any favourable Occasion, to make him some favourable Amends.</p>
            <p>IN the Conferring of <hi>Good Offices</hi> we have usually a regard either to Peoples <hi>Manners,</hi> or to their <hi>Fortunes</hi>; and therefore we have the Common saying ready at our Tongues end,<note place="margin">In Benefits consider the <hi>Man,</hi> not the <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune.</hi>

For we are naturally inclined to lay out our services where we may reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably hope for the speediest, and the most Certain Return.

It is our Duty, as much as in us lies, to consult the Common Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Both: Or however, to take Care of Particulars: but in such manner that the whole may be the Better for it; Or at least not the Worse. <hi>Caius Gracchus</hi>'s <hi>Excessive Largesse</hi> of <hi>Corn</hi> to the People, was <hi>Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous</hi>; for it exhausted the <hi>Treasury</hi>; but the <hi>Moderate Donative</hi> of <hi>M.

For though men Associate by an Impulse of Nature, it was Desire and Hope yet of keeping what they had gotten, that made them Build Cities, for their Protection. It has been a Great Inconvenience that our Fore-fathers have been often put upon, the charging of the People with Extraordinary Taxes:<note place="margin">No Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Taxes.</note> which happened either through the Lowness of the Treasury, or the Expence and Burthen of a Continual War. This is a Course by all means Possible to be Avoided, by lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in of Provisions Beforehand; but if ever any Commonwealth should fall under This Neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity (for I had rather foretel it of any Other, then Ours; as I speak This only by way of General Discourse) it will be highly necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry that the People be punctually enformed of the Exigent; and that there is no way for them to subsist, but by complying with such a Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity.

            <p>THERE is not certainly a more Detestable Vice (especially in Princes,<note place="margin">Avarice a Detestable Vice.</note> and Publique Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates) than Covetousness: And it is not only a Mean thing, but an Impious, to make a Prey of the Commonwealth.

yet when out of an Affectation of Popularity they come to propound such a <hi>Levelling Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision of Lands</hi> as is above-mentioned; and either to Force the Right Owners out of their Possessions, or to the remitting of Just Debts; these People shake the very Foundations of Government; In the First place Dissolving the Bonds of Concord and Agreement, which can never consist with This way of taking Moneys from Some, and Discharging Others. And what's become of Common Equity then, when no Man is left the Master of his Own? For it is a Privilege Essential to a Community, that it be Free, and every Man secur'd in the Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of what belongs to him. Neither does This way of Confounding all things create that Interest and Reputation among the People, which the Projectors may Imagine: for it makes the Loser still your Enemy; and the very Receiver will hardly thank you for't nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: Or at best, so coldly, as if it were a thing he had no great mind to: Especially dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembling the Inward satisfaction of being for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given a Debt; for fear of being thought un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to Pay it. Whereas the Injur'd Party will never Forget it, but carry the purpose of a Revenge in his Heart. Or what if there should be more to whom we Unjustly Give, than there are from whom we do as Unjustly Take away? This does not mend the matter One jot: for we are not to judge in This case by Number,<note place="margin">The Danger of Invading Proprieties.</note> but Weight.

The Matter was so handled, that, upon a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable Estimate of the Lands, some were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded to content themselves with the Value in Money, and to yield the Land; and Others chose rather to take Money for their Land, than to Contest for the Recovery of it.

He lays down <hi>Three Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> that men are want to deliberate and advise upon, in the Case of <hi>Duty.

He has written Three Books upon the Two former Heads; and promised a Discourse upon the Third; but he has not been so good as his word: which I do the more wonder at, because I find in his Scholar <hi>Posidonius,</hi> that he lived Thirty years after the Publishing of These Books. And I am in some Admiration too, that <hi>Posidonius,</hi> in his Commentaries, should pass the matter over so slightly; espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially making This Remarque upon it, that of the whole Body of Philosophy, This is the most necessary Part. There are some that will not have This to be an <hi>Oversight</hi> in <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naetius</hi>; but a Point left out upon Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; as a thing wholly Impertinent.

From hence there may arise another Question, whether the Third Branch of <hi>Panaetius</hi>'s Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision should not have been absolutely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, without any mention of it all. But
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:42735:83"/>
it is Certain however, that he did at first undertake it, and then let it fall. He that makes a Tripartite Division, and goes thorough with Two Parts of it, is undoubtedly answerable for the Third: And he passes his word over and above toward the latter end of his Third Book, that he will go on with it. And we have the Authority of <hi>Posidonius</hi> himself to Witness as much; writing in a certain Epistle what <hi>Publius Rutilius Rufus</hi> (an Auditor of <hi>Panaetius)</hi> was wont to say. As there was never any Peinter (says he) that durst ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture upon Finishing the Picture of <hi>Venus,</hi> which <hi>Apelles</hi> had begun (such was the Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy of the Face, that there was no hope of matching it with a suitable Body) so in the Case of <hi>Panaetius,</hi> the Excellency of those things which he did perfect, was so Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scendent, that no man after him durst ever attempt the supplying of what he either Omitted, or left Imperfect. So that of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naetius</hi>'s Intention there can be no longer any Doubt. But yet whether he did Well or Ill in adding the Third member of his Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, may perhaps bear a Dispute: For taking it either according to the <hi>Stoiques,</hi> that no thing can be <hi>Good</hi> but that which is <hi>Honest</hi>; or with the <hi>Peripatetiques,</hi> that <hi>Honesty</hi> is the <hi>Sovereign Good,</hi> to such a degree, that all other Goods are as nothing in the Ballance Against it; they do both of them however agree in This, that <hi>Profit</hi> can never be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted into a Competition with <hi>Honesty.</hi>

            <p>The Duties here Treated of, are with the <hi>Stoiques</hi> a kind of <hi>Second-rate Honesty</hi>; and not <hi>peculiar</hi> to <hi>wise men,</hi> but <hi>Common</hi> to <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Nature:</hi> And therefore they affect all people that have in them the least spark of Good Nature, or Virtue.

the Law of Nature. The Former is certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly True; and so is the Other, by Consequence. It is a Ridiculous Shift, to say, that I would not take away any thing from my Father, or from my Brother, to put in my Own Pocket; but to take from Other people, is quite ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Case: as if every Individual were not concerned in the Protection of the Whole: An Opinion utterly Inconsistent with the Rules of Government.</p>
            <p>THERE are some again will have the <hi>Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens</hi> Provided for, but not <hi>Strangers</hi>: And These Men tear up the very Foundations of Human Society.

This must not be done yet; no not upon any Terms: Life is not so dear to me as my Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and my Resolution not to wrong any Man for my Own Benefit. Suppose an Honest Man almost frozen to death might save his Life by taking away the Cloak of <hi>Phalaris</hi>; (a Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and a Bloody Tyrant) should he not do it? This is a Case easily determin'd: For the taking of any thing away from another, for a Man's Own sake, is Inhuman, and against the Law of Nature, let the Man be never so worth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less. But in the Case of a Person whose Life may be of Eminent Use and Service to the Commonwealth, to take any thing from such a Worthless Person to preserve so necessary an Instrument to the Publique; and to take it purely upon That Consideration, it is not blame-worthy: But Otherwise, I must rather bear my Own Misfortunes, than Relieve my self by what I force from another Man: so that it is not more against Nature to be Sick, or Necessitous, than to Seize upon, or Covet the Goods of Another: But the Abandoning of the Common Good is an Offence to Nature; for it is Unjust; and therefore the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that Regulates and Provides for the Common Welfare of Mankind, does in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner direct the Translation of Necessaries from a slothful and unprofitable Wretch, to the behoof of a Wise, a Good, and a Valiant Man, and whose Loss might be of great damage to the Government: Provided that it be done meerly out of such a respect, without any Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, or Self love, or making use of a Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Pretext for a Colour to a Particular In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justice.

justice. In so doing, I keep my self still up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on my Duty, consulting the Benefit of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, and (that which I often Inculcate) of Human Society.</p>
            <p>AS to the Case of <hi>Phalaris,</hi> the Decision is Obvious: For a Tyrant is rather an Enemy, then a Member of Human Society; and there can be no Crime in the Dispoiling of an Usur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, whom it is Lawful to Kill; and it were well if the whole Race of this impious and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stilent sort of Men were Exterminated from having to do with Mankind. For as we cut off Mortifi'd Limbs, when the Blood and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits have in a manner forsaken them, and that they grow dangerous to the Rest: so should that fierce and outrageous Brutality be sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, if I may so say, from the Common Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity of the Publique Body. Of This Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity are all those Questions of Duty, whereof the Resolution depends upon the Circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Times: which I presume, <hi>Panaetius</hi> would have persu'd, if somewhat of accident or bus'<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness had not taken him off from his Purpose. We have said enough in our former Books up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on This Matter; to shew what we are always to shun, as evil and shameful in it self, and what we are Not obliged always to avoid, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is not <hi>always,</hi> either <hi>Mis-becoming,</hi> or <hi>Dishonest.</hi>

            <p>BUT being now about to Crown the Work we have begun,<note place="margin">Certain Principles to be given for granted.</note> I must deal with You, (my <hi>Cicero</hi>) as the Mathematicians Do with their Disciples. They lay down certain <hi>Postulata,</hi>
               <pb n="157" facs="tcp:42735:89"/>
to be taken before-hand for granted, without the Trouble of discoursing the Points; to the end that they may make themselves more easily understood. So must I require of You (my <hi>Cicero</hi>) to yield me This Point, (if you can afford it) that <hi>Nothing is desirable for it self, but what is Honest.</hi> Now if <hi>Cratippus</hi> will not allow of the Proposition whole as it lies; This yet, I presume, will not be deny'd, That <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue</hi> is <hi>Chiefly,</hi> if not <hi>Only</hi> to be <hi>desired,</hi> and <hi>for its own sake.</hi> It is all one to me, which of the Two you take, for they are Both of them more Probable than any thing else: And First, let me vindicate <hi>Panaetius,</hi> in This, that he never supposed a <hi>Competition</hi> of <hi>Vtility,</hi> and <hi>Virtue</hi>; (nor could he have justifi'd it if he had) but he is to be understood of things that <hi>seem</hi> Profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table; for over and over in all his Discourses he still makes <hi>Vtility,</hi> and <hi>Virtue</hi> to be <hi>Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tibles,</hi> and represents it to be the most Pestilent Errour that ever enter'd into Human Life, the Opinion that Divided them. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he introduced a Repugnancy, betwixt <hi>Appearances,</hi> and <hi>Truths</hi>; not as <hi>separating</hi> the <hi>Profitable</hi> from the <hi>Honest</hi>; but for our Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and Instruction, that we might judge betwixt them. We shall therefore dispatch this remaining Part without any help from others; and upon our own Account, (as we say:) For since <hi>Panaetius</hi> left This Subject, I have seen nothing yet that has given me any sort of satisfaction.</p>
            <p>WE are all of us apt to be moved upon any thing that presents it self unto us, under the
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:42735:90"/>
appearance of Profit. But if upon looking narrowly into it, we find any thing that is dishonest, or shameful, annexed thereunto; we are not to leave it then, as a thing <hi>Profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table,</hi> but as considering that <hi>Vtility,</hi> and <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honesty</hi> cannot stand together.<note place="margin">Nothing can be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficial, that is dishonest.</note> For if there be nothing so <hi>Contrary</hi> to <hi>Nature</hi> as the <hi>One</hi> or so <hi>Agreeable</hi> to it, as the <hi>Other</hi>; (for Nature affects what is Right, Convenient, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant, and despises the Contrary) it is impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible that they should Both meet in the same Subject. Again; If we are born for <hi>Virtue</hi>; either (according to <hi>Zeno) Virtue is to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired for it self alone,</hi> or (according to <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotle) it weighs down all other things:</hi> then does it follow, of Necessity that <hi>Virtue</hi> must be either the <hi>Only,</hi> or the <hi>Supreme Good.</hi> So that whether way soever it be taken, that which is <hi>Good,</hi> is certainly <hi>Profitable</hi>; and that which is <hi>Prositable,</hi> is certainly <hi>Good.</hi> Those Men therefore are very short-sighted, that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently lay hold of that which <hi>appears Profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi> and consider it <hi>apart</hi> from that which <hi>is Honest.</hi> From Hence come Murthers, Poyson<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, Forgeries, Thefts, Publique Cheats, Oppressions, Squeezing of the People, or our Confederates: From Hence come the Intole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Insolencies of Men of over-grown For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes; and finally, Ambition, and the Thirst of Dominion; then which nothing can be more Ruinous, or Pernicious in a Free City. They take false Measures of the <hi>Value</hi> of things, without so much as dreaming of the <hi>Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>; not the <hi>Punishment</hi> of the <hi>Laws,</hi> (for That they can with Ease break thorough) but

That of the <hi>Conscience,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The great Punishment is that of Conscience.</note> which is the bitterest of all.

Upon the Opening of these Doors, he discover'd the Dead Body of a Man, of a Prodigious Size, with a Golden Ring upon his Finger. <hi>Gyges</hi> boldly pluckt it off by force, and put it upon his Own, and being the King's Shepherd, he went his way, and joyn'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self with Other Shepherds. Finding, that upon turning the Stone of the Ring, <hi>Inwards,</hi> he became Invisible to <hi>Others,</hi> and yet saw eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

All this Lewdness he Committed by the help of this <hi>Ring,</hi> and so made himself King of <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia.</hi> Now if a Wise Man were the Master of such a Ring, he would reckon himself no more Priviledg'd to do an Ill thing with it, then without it; for an Honest Man considers the <hi>Goodness</hi> of the <hi>Action,</hi> not the <hi>Privacy</hi> of it. It is objected by some (that shew themselves to be better <hi>Men,</hi> then <hi>Philosophers</hi>) that this Story out of <hi>Plato</hi> is only a Tale; as if any Man would report it for a thing either True, or Possible: but see however the Force, and Scope of This Ring, and of This Example. How many things are done out of Avarice, Ambition, Pride, Lust, that no body knows of, or so much as suspects? Suppose that This Impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty could be kept so secret, that neither God nor Man should come to know it: Would you commit it? <hi>'Tis a thing impossible,</hi> (they say, whether it be so or not.) But what, would they do (say I) if they could do the thing, which they say they cannot? They return you the same senseless Answer over again: they say 'tis <hi>Impossible</hi>; and there they stick: not at all comprehending the Drift, and Import of the Question. For in asking what a Man would do if he could <hi>Conceal</hi> it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I do not ask whether he can <hi>Conceal</hi> it, or <hi>no:</hi>

            <p>THERE fall out divers Cases, that under an Appearance of Profit,<note place="margin">The appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of Profit of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes distracts us.</note> many times disorder our Thoughts, and trouble us in our Resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: not as upon a Deliberation whether a man should strain a Point of <hi>Honesty</hi> in regard of the <hi>Greatness</hi> of the <hi>Benefit</hi> in prospect; (for That were <hi>Mean,</hi> and <hi>Dishonest</hi>) but whether That which seems so <hi>very Profitable</hi> may be done without <hi>Dishonour.</hi> It might look like an unjust thing in <hi>Brutus,</hi> the Depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of <hi>Collatine,</hi> his <hi>Fellow-Consul,</hi> who in the Expulsion of the Kings, was both his <hi>Partner</hi> in the <hi>Advice,</hi> and his <hi>Asfistant</hi> in the Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: But when the whole Body of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipals of the City had agreed together to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirpate the whole <hi>Family,</hi> and the <hi>Relations</hi> of that Proud Prince, as well as the Name of the <hi>Tarquins</hi>; (which was a Resolution of Publique Advantage.) This was so Honest, and Just an Action, that <hi>Collatine</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self was Obliged to approve of the Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: so that this Utility was valu'd for the Honesty sake, without which, in truth, it had not been Profitable. But This did not hold in the Case of that Prince that Founded our City: For he was so wrought upon by the shew of Profit, that he kill'd his Brother upon the
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:42735:92"/>
appearing Advantage of rather Governing Alone then with Company. He cast off all Piety and Humanity, for the obteining of That which seemed unto Him to be Profitable, tho' it proved the clear Contrary. The <hi>preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Honesty</hi> in the Action, was to punish the Affront of his Brothers leaping in scorn over the Wall; but it was neither Competent, nor Likely. Wherefore, under favour of either <hi>Quirinus</hi> or <hi>Romulus</hi>; (no matter whether) it was undoubtedly a Crime.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">How far we may look to our selves.</note>AND yet we are not to neglect our own Advantages neither; or part with any thing to Others, when we want it our selves. But every man should attend his own Profit, as far as may be without Injury to Another. <hi>Chrysippus</hi> had many Witty sayings, whereof this was one. <hi>In the running of a Course,</hi> (says he) <hi>a man may be allow'd to strive, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend his Vtmost: but to trip up his Antagonists Heels, or to lay hands upon him, this is a thing not to be done upon any terms. So for any man to get That which may serve for the use of Life, is very Fair, and allowable; but to take it away from Another, is not Lawfull.</hi>

            <p>IN Friendship, 'tis true, there are many Niceties as well in the not doing of any good Office which may Honestly be done,<note place="margin">Many Nice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in Friendships.</note> as in the doing of any thing for a Friend Contrary to Justice. But one short Rule will serve upon This whole Matter, and it is no hard one nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Those things that seem Profitable; as Honours, Riches, Pleasures, and Other Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances of the like Kind; these things are
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:42735:92"/>
never to be preferr'd before Friendship: But no Good man will do any thing for a Friend, that is either against the Commonwealth, his Oath, or his Word: No not if he were him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to be a Judge in his Friends Case; for he lays down the Person of a <hi>Friend,</hi> where he takes up That of a <hi>Iudge.</hi> I would have him wish that his Friend may have <hi>Iustice</hi> on <hi>his side</hi>; and I would have him allow him all the Favour in point of <hi>Time,</hi> that the Law will permit; but when he comes to pass his <hi>Sentence,</hi> let him remember, and consider, that he calls God to witness; or (as I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose) his Own Conscience, the Divinest thing Heaven it self ever bestow'd upon a Mortal. It was therefore a Worthy Practice of our An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestors; They never ask'd any thing of a Judge (and I wish we did so at This day) but upon Condition that it might consist with Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice. This Request has relation to those things which (as I said e'en now) a Judge may Fairly allow to a Friend; for if a man must of Necessity do all things that a Friend would have him do, this is no longer a Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, but a Confederacy. Let me be understood only of Common Friendships: For among men that are Wise, and Perfect, there can be no such thing. The Story goes of <hi>Damon,</hi> and <hi>Pythias,</hi>

               </note> (<hi>Pythagoreans</hi>) so great was the Kindness they had for one another, that when <hi>Dionysius</hi> had sentenced one of them to death, the Party Condemned only desired a few days respite to put his Affairs in order; and the Other became Surety (Body for Body) for his Appearance. The Prisoner return'd at

his day, and the Tyrant fell into such admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration at their <hi>Generosity,</hi> and <hi>Iustice,</hi> that he requested them to receive Him as a Third man, into that Friendship. Wherefore in all Friendships, where the Profitable and the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest meet in Comparison we should never con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider the Profit, but square our actions ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Honesty. But wheresoever any thing shall be required in <hi>Friendship,</hi> which does not stand with <hi>Honesty,</hi> in that Case <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi> and <hi>Faith,</hi> must take place of <hi>Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship.</hi> This is the Rule by which we are to make Choice of the Duty here in Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p>WE are Liable also to many Publique Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stakes under the Appearance of Profit;<note place="margin">Publique Mistakes under the appearance of Profit.</note> as our Countrymen were to blame in the Irreco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verable Destruction of <hi>Corinth.</hi> And the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenians</hi> did yet worse, in cutting off the Thumbs of the people of <hi>AEgina,</hi> only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they were good Seamen, and they reckon'd that this might turn to their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, and Security, because of the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borhood of <hi>AEgina</hi> to one of their Principal Ports.

But it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly most Inhuman, absolutely to deny the Common Benefit of Protection, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercourse in a City, to Strangers. Those are Great and Remarkable Cases wherein the <hi>Shew</hi> or <hi>Colour</hi> of <hi>Publique Vtility</hi> is despised, in comparison with <hi>Honesty.</hi> We have in the Story of our Commonwealth, a World of Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Examples.

There was not the least sign of Fear among us, nor any Mention of Peace; such is the Power of Honesty, that nothing of Profit can appear against it! The <hi>Athenians,</hi> when they were no longer able to resist the force of the <hi>Persians,</hi> came to a Resolve of putting all their Wives, and Children into <hi>Traezen</hi>; to abandon the City, and maintain the Liberty of <hi>Greece</hi> with a <hi>Navy.</hi> There was one <hi>Cyrcilus</hi> that advis'd them rather to stay in the City, and receive <hi>Xerxes</hi> into it; but they Ston'd him to death for his Counsel.

How much did these people go beyond us; that suffer our <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates</hi> to go <hi>Free,</hi> while our <hi>Confederates</hi> are <hi>Tributaries</hi>? Let it be taken therefore for granted, that nothing can ever be <hi>Profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table</hi> that is <hi>Dishonorable</hi>; no, not in the very Possession of That which we account so to be. Nay it is a great Infelicity of Judgment, to Imagine that any thing can be <hi>Profitable,</hi> that is <hi>Dishonest.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUT there fall out many Occasions (as I have said before) wherein the <hi>Profitable,</hi> and the <hi>Honest</hi> may fal in <hi>Competition:</hi> In which Case we should consider how far they stand in direct Opposition, and wherein they may be fairly reconcil'd: As for Instance, upon these Questions. An Honest man sets sail from <hi>Alexandria</hi> to <hi>Rhodes</hi> with a Lading of Corn; the <hi>Rhodians</hi> in great distress for want of it;<note place="margin">Some nice Cases of Conscience.</note> and the Commodity bearing an Excessive Price. This Person knows that there are
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:42735:94"/>
other <hi>Alexandrian</hi> Ships under way, and bound for the same Port, and with the same <hi>Cargo:</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or no shall he tell the <hi>Rhodians</hi> now, that there are other Merchants coming with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, or say nothing of it, and make the best Market of his Corn that he can? We put this Case, supposing him to be a <hi>good</hi> and a <hi>Wise man,</hi> and the matter to be under Deliberation. If he thinks it an <hi>Ill</hi> thing to <hi>Conceal</hi> this from the <hi>Rhodians</hi> he will not do it; but he makes some doubt whether it be <hi>Ill,</hi> or <hi>No.</hi> In Difficulties of This Nature, <hi>Diogenes,</hi> the <hi>Babi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonian,</hi> (a Grave and Famous <hi>Stoique</hi>) is of One Opinion; and his Disciple <hi>Antipater</hi> (a very acute man) is of another. <hi>Antipater</hi> will have all the Circumstances laid Open; so that the Purchaser may not be kept Ignorant of any thing, which the Other knows. <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genes</hi> says that <hi>the Vender is bo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>nd to Discover all the Faults,</hi> so far as he is obliged to it by the <hi>Civil Law</hi>; and to manage his Bargain with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Fraud. So that being to sell the Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity, he may without Deceipt make the best on't. <hi>Here</hi> (says he) <hi>I have brought my Corn; I have run the Risque on't; and I let no higher a rate upon the Commodity then Others do; nay perhaps I offer it Cheaper: If you can have it any where else, wher's the Injury</hi>? Now <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tipater,</hi> on the other side, Reasons it Thus. How is That? (says he) It is our Duty to Consult the Good of Mankind, and to serve Human Society; and we came into the World under That Obligation. We have Principles of Nature, which we are bound to Follow and Obey; and we are to account nothing
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:42735:95"/>
               <hi>Profitable to our selves,</hi> that is not so to the <hi>Publique:</hi> And likewise, to account of the <hi>Publique Profit,</hi> as our <hi>Own.</hi> Shall we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal That then from a <hi>Society</hi> of men, which so much concerns their <hi>Commodity,</hi> and <hi>Supply? Diogenes</hi> will reply (perhaps) that it is one thing to <hi>Conceal</hi> a matter, and another thing not to <hi>Tell</hi> it: Do I tell you (at this Instant) what is the Nature of the Gods, or the end of Good men; which are things much more Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable to be known, then the Price of Wheat? And yet you will not say that I Conceal This from you. But it is not absolutely necessary for me neither to tell you every thing which may be Profitable for you to hear. But the Other will tell you <hi>Yes, it is necessary</hi>; if you remember that men are naturally link'd to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in <hi>Society.</hi> Well (says the Other) I do not forget it: But will you have it to be such a Society then, as that no man shall have any thing particular in it of his Own? If it comes to That once, there's no longer any <hi>Buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> and <hi>Selling,</hi> but only <hi>Giving.</hi> You see in this whole Dipute, that it is not said, tho' This or That be <hi>Dishonest,</hi> I will yet Do it, because it is <hi>Expedient:</hi> But it must be so <hi>Expedient,</hi> that there be nothing <hi>Dishonorable</hi> in it. Now (on the Other hand) out of that very Consideration that it is <hi>Disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable,</hi> it is therefore <hi>not to be done.</hi> Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose an Honest man has a mind to put off his House for some fault or inconvenience in it, only known to himself: As a <hi>Contagious Air</hi>; (for the Purpose) tho' it may (perhaps) pass for <hi>Healthful</hi>; all the Rooms annoy'd with
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:42735:95"/>
Vermin, Ill-built, or Ruinous, which is only known (as I say) to the Master of the House. The Question is, if he Conceals these faults to get a better Rate for his House then he could otherwise have done, whether he does <hi>well,</hi> or <hi>ill,</hi> in That <hi>Concealment? An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tipater</hi> will have it to be very <hi>Ill done,</hi> and near the Case of <hi>not setting a man Right that's out of his way.</hi> A Crime which was punish'd at <hi>Athens</hi> by a Formal Solemnity of Publique Execrations. Is not This the Suffering of the Purchaser to ruine himself, and to fall into the worst of Snares, by a Mistake? Nay it is worse yet, then the <hi>not shewing of the way,</hi> for one man to lead another knowingly, and wilfully, into an Errour. <hi>Diogenes</hi> asks, on the Other side, who forc'd you to buy it? Nay he did not (says he) so much as Advise you to't. That which did not please the One, he exposed to Sale, and the Other bought that which he had a mind to. If he shall not be taken for a Cheat, that sets up a Bill of a very good Farm to be Let or Sold, and well built, and in repair, tho' it be neither the One, nor the Other, much less shall he be accounted one, that does not so much as Commend his House; for where the Purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser uses his own Judgment, what Fraud can there be in the Seller? But if we are not obliged, in all Cases, to make good every word we say, how should we be oblig'd to make good That which we do not say? Nor can any thing be more Ridiculous then for a Merchant to publish the Faults of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity he exposes to Sale. What would be
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:42735:96"/>
more senseless then to make Proclamation by a Common Cryer, <hi>Here's an Infected House to be Sold</hi>? Now so it falls out, that in some doubtful Cases, the <hi>Honesty</hi> of the Action may be defended, on the One hand, and the <hi>Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit</hi> of it so qualifi'd on the Other; that it may not only be <hi>Honourable,</hi> to do that which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears <hi>Profitable,</hi> but even <hi>Dishonorable,</hi> to <hi>Omit</hi> it. This is a Point that comes often into question betwixt things <hi>Profitable</hi> and <hi>Honest.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THESE Difficulties must be set right: for it is not our <hi>Business</hi> to start a question, but to give a Resolution.<note place="margin">Resolutions upon the former Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.</note> It is my Opinion, that neither in the Case of the <hi>Rhodian Corn-Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant,</hi> nor in That of the <hi>House</hi> offer'd to <hi>Sale,</hi> the <hi>Concealment</hi> there supposed was <hi>Iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiable.</hi> For it is not properly the <hi>Concealing</hi> of a thing, to say nothing of it; but the keeping of another man, for our own advantage, in Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance of that which he is very much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd to know. What kind of a Conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment This is, and the Quality of the man that uses it, who does not discern? This is not the Practice undoubtedly of an Open, a Frank, a Sincere, a Just, or a Good man: but rather of a Shifting, a Close, a Deceitful, a Malicious, a Sly Shuffler, and of a very Jugler. How can any man expect to Get by the Bargain, that wears these foul Names, and lies under all these Reproaches.</p>
            <p>BUT if the saying <hi>Nothing</hi> in this Case be so Blameable; what shall we think of Them then that speak <hi>False</hi>?<note place="margin">A Pleasant Cheat.</note> 
               <hi>Caius Cannius</hi> (a Knight of <hi>Rome,</hi> and one that wanted neither Wit
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:42735:96"/>
nor Learning) going sometimes to <hi>Syracuse,</hi> not upon Bus'ness (as he was want to say) but for his diversion; he gave out that he had a great mind to buy some Gardens there, where he might enjoy his Friends when he had a mind to't, without interruption. When this came to be talk'd of, there was one <hi>Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thius,</hi> in <hi>Syracuse,</hi> that drove the Trade of a <hi>Banker. I have Gardens here</hi> (says he) <hi>tho' not to be Sold, but however if</hi> Cannius <hi>pleases, he may use them as his Own:</hi> And so he invites <hi>Cannius</hi> to those Gardens, the next day<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. Upon <hi>Cannius</hi>'s promise to come, <hi>Pythi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> (whose bus'ness gave him a great Interest there, among all sorts of People) sent for the Fishermen; and directed them to meet next day, and Fish just before his Gardens; and so gave them their Lesson what to do and how to behave themselves. <hi>Cannius</hi> came at his time, where he found a Magnificent Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment that <hi>Pythius</hi> had provided for him. There were a great many Boats before the Gardens, and every man brought the Fish he had taken, and laid them at <hi>Pythius</hi>'s Feet. What's the meaning of all this (says <hi>Canni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi>) so many Fishes, and Boats? <hi>Pythius</hi> told him, there was no great wonder in't; For there is not any Fish (says he) in <hi>Syra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse</hi> which is not to be had in this place. They take in their Water here, and the Town cannot be without This Convenience. This set <hi>Cannius</hi> agog upon the Purchase, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing would serve but <hi>Pythius</hi> must sell him the place; He seem'd, at First, very unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to part with it; but without more words
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:42735:97"/>
they came at last to an Agreement: <hi>Cannius</hi> was a Rich man, and presently struck up a Bargain (for the Gardens, and every thing that belong'd to them) with <hi>Pythius,</hi> at his own Price: Security was given for the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and the bus'ness finish'd. <hi>Cannius</hi> invited some of his Familiar Friends thither the next day: and he himself coming betimes, and find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no Boats there, enquir'd of the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borhood whether the Fishermen kept Holy-day that day, because he saw none of them There. Their Answer was, that They knew nothing of any Holy-day, nor of any Fisher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men that us'd to be There: Insomuch that they wonder'd what brought them thither the day before. This put <hi>Cannius</hi> into a Rage: But what Remedy? For my Friend and Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legue <hi>Aquilius</hi> had not as yet made any Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision against <hi>Dolus Malus,</hi> or <hi>Couzenage.</hi> Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on my Demand to <hi>Aquilius</hi> what was intended by that same <hi>Dolus Malus,</hi> he told me, that it was <hi>the pretending of one thing, and doing another.</hi> Which truly was a Full and Clear Definition of it, and worthy of a Wise man. Wherefore <hi>Pythius,</hi> and all like him, that <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend one thing,</hi> and <hi>do another</hi>; are to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted <hi>Perfidious, Wicked,</hi> and <hi>Deceitful</hi>; So that nothing can be <hi>Profitable</hi> to us, that is polluted by so many <hi>Crimes.</hi> But if <hi>Aquilius</hi>'s Definition be True, there must be no Feigning or Dissembling allow'd of in Human Society: And a Good man will neither do the One nor the other, either to Buy or Sell, to more Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage. And That Deceipt was punishable also by the Laws: As in the Case of <hi>Guardianship</hi> by the
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:42735:97"/>
               <hi>Twelve Tables.</hi> And so was the <hi>Circumvention</hi> of <hi>Min ours</hi> punishable by the <hi>Latorian Laws.</hi> And sometimes by <hi>Arbitration,</hi> even <hi>without a Law</hi>; where the Question was matter of Faith, and Trust. But of all other Judgments the Words that are used in the <hi>Formulary</hi> of an <hi>Arbitrement</hi> upon a <hi>Marriage-Agreement</hi> are most remarkable: As <note n="*" place="margin">Words of Form.</note> 
               <hi>MELIVS, AEQVI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VS,</hi> the <hi>Better,</hi> the <hi>Iuster</hi>: and in matters of <hi>Contract,</hi> or <hi>Confidence, INTER BONOS BE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NE AGIER; Fair Dealing among Good Men.</hi> Can there be any Mixture of <hi>Fraud</hi> now in <hi>BETTER,</hi> and <hi>IVSTER</hi>? Or what place is there for <hi>Collusion,</hi> or <hi>Iniquity,</hi> in <hi>Fair Deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing among Honest Men</hi>?</p>
            <p>NOW the <hi>Dolus Malus,</hi> or Deceipt appears either in <hi>Simulation,</hi> which is a Pretence of something that is <hi>not</hi>; or <hi>Dissimulation,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Simulation and Dissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation.</note> that is to say a <hi>Disguise,</hi> or <hi>Concealment</hi> of some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what that <hi>Is.</hi> Wherefore there must be no <hi>Lye</hi> admitted in any Business, or Contract; Nor should there be any Underhand substituting of a Buyer, or a Seller, to enhance, or to bring down the Price; but Both Parties should say <hi>at a Word</hi> what they will <hi>Give,</hi> or <hi>Take. Q. Scaevola,</hi> the Son of <hi>Publius,</hi> being upon a Purchase, bade the Proprietor tell him in One Word what he would have for the Estate: He did so: And <hi>Scaevola</hi> told him he had under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valu'd it,<note place="margin">A Generous Scruple of <hi>Scaevola's.</hi>
               </note> and so gave him <hi>Two Thousand Crowns</hi> more than his Bargain. There is not any Man but will confess that This was the part of a <hi>Good Man,</hi> tho' in the Opinion perhaps of some People, not of a <hi>Wise Man</hi>: As if the Other
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:42735:98"/>
had set it lower than he could afford it. This is a mischief therefore, that <hi>Some</hi> Men are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted <hi>Good,</hi> and <hi>Other</hi> Men <hi>Wise,</hi> as if they could be <hi>separated. Ennius</hi> says that a Man's <hi>Wisdom</hi> serves him to little purpose, if it be not <hi>Profitable</hi> to <hi>himself.</hi> This may be true E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, if it were but agreed with <hi>Ennius</hi> what it is to be <hi>Profitable.</hi> I find <hi>Hecalon</hi> the <hi>Rho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian (Panaetius</hi>'s Scholar) telling <hi>Q. Tubero</hi> in his Books of <hi>Offices,</hi> that <hi>It is the part of a Wise Man to do nothing against Publique Customs, Laws, and Institutions; and withal, to take good heed to his Fortune, and Family</hi>: For we should not propound to be Rich, only to our Selves, but to our Children, Relations, Friends, and chiefly, for the Service of the <hi>Republique</hi>: For the Estates and Provisions of Particulars, are the Wealth of the City. The proceeding of <hi>Scaevola</hi> above-mentioned would never suit with <hi>Hecaton</hi>: For he only says that he would not do any thing for his own Profit that were Unlawful: and truly he deserves little Thanks, or Commendation for his peins. But allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing both <hi>Lying,</hi> and <hi>Dissembling</hi> to be this same <hi>Dolus Malus,</hi> or <hi>Deceipt,</hi> there are very few things clear of That Fraud. Or if he be only the Good Man, that obliges as many as he can, and hurts no Body; such a Good Man will not be easily found. It can never be <hi>Profitable</hi> to do an <hi>Ill Thing</hi>; because it is always <hi>unal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowable,</hi> and <hi>shameful.</hi> And it must ever be <hi>beneficial</hi> to be a <hi>Good Man,</hi> because it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways <hi>Honest.</hi>

The Civilians have also set a Punishment upon <hi>Concealments</hi> too; by enacting, that if the Seller of an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state knew any Fault or Errour in it, without expressly acquainting the Purchaser with it, he should be obliged to make it good. As in the case of the <hi>Augurs Tower</hi>; where they were to take their Observations from the Flight of Birds. <hi>Titus Claudius Centimalus,</hi> having some Houses upon the Hill <hi>Caelius,</hi> the <hi>Augurs</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded him to pull them down, because they hinder'd their prospect. <hi>Claudius</hi> expos'd Those Houses to Sale, and so put them off; and <hi>Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius Calpurnius Lanarius</hi> was the Purchaser. The <hi>Augurs</hi> found the same fault still with the Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, when they were in His Possession: so that he pull'd them down.

The Sentence was
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:42735:99"/>
This, That since upon the Sale of That Estate, he had not told the Other of the Inconvenience which he knew it was expos'd to; he should indempnifie the Buyer of it; Concluding, that the Proprietor was bound in Conscience to tell the Purchaser what damage might ensue upon it. Now if This was a Just Judgement, it was not Warrantable either in the <hi>Corn-Merchant,</hi> or in him that sold the <hi>Infected Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,</hi> to conceal as is above supposed. But it is not possible for any Law to reach all the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Cases of these <hi>Concealments</hi>: And yet however, so far as they go, they are diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly observ'd. <hi>Marcus Marius Gratidianus</hi> sold to <hi>Cai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But <hi>Marius</hi> made no mention of it in the Conveying of his Right. The Cause was brought into the Court; <hi>Crassus</hi> was for <hi>Orata,</hi> and <hi>Anthony</hi> for <hi>Gratidianus.

Now to what End is all This, but to shew, that our Forefathers were not pleas'd with Wiles, and Shifts?</p>

For <hi>Prudence</hi> is pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in the <hi>Choice</hi> of <hi>Good,</hi> or <hi>Evil</hi>; but <hi>Craft</hi> prefers <hi>Evil</hi> before <hi>Good</hi>; at least if things that are <hi>Dishonourable</hi> be <hi>Evil.</hi> And 'tis not only in <hi>Lands,</hi> and <hi>Houses,</hi> that the Civil Law, in Conformity to That of Nature, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids Fraud, and Circumvention; but even in the very dealing for <hi>Slaves,</hi> the Seller should act as frankly as in Other Cases. For he that is presum'd to know whether the <hi>Slave</hi> be <hi>Healthful, Honest,</hi> a <hi>Fugitive,</hi> or the like;
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:42735:100"/>
the <hi>AEdiles Law</hi> makes <hi>That Master</hi> answerable for the <hi>Servant.</hi> But This does not hold in the Case of an <hi>Heir</hi> that found such a <hi>Slave,</hi> or <hi>Servant</hi> in the <hi>Family.</hi> From hence it may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, since <hi>Nature</hi> is the Fountein of <hi>Iustice,</hi> that it is also according to Nature, that no man should make Advantage to himself of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mans Ignorance. Nor is there any greater Pest, in Human Society, then a perverse <hi>Craft,</hi> under the Masque of <hi>Simplicity:</hi>
               <note place="margin">No Pest like Craft under the Masque of Simplicity.</note> And from thence proceed those Innumerable Cases, where the <hi>Profitable</hi> comes in Concurrence with the <hi>Honest.</hi> For, where's the man that would stick at any <hi>Injustice,</hi> if he might but hope for <hi>Impu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ity</hi>; or come off, under a pretence of <hi>Ignorance</hi>? Let us examine the Matter if you please; and in Those Instances where the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people, perhaps, are scarce sensible that they do amiss: For we do not speak in This place, of <hi>Murthers, Poysonings, Forgeries, Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beries,</hi> or <hi>Embesilments</hi> of the <hi>Publique Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,</hi> which should rather be supprest by <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,</hi> and <hi>Fetters,</hi> then by <hi>Words,</hi> and <hi>Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phical Precepts</hi>: But let us here rather consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der what we find commonly to be done, even among those that have the Reputation of <hi>Honest</hi> men. There were some people that brought out of <hi>Greece</hi> to <hi>Rome</hi> a forg'd <hi>Will</hi> of <hi>Q. Minutius Basilius,</hi>
               <note place="margin">A Case of Conscience about a Forgery.</note> (who was a very wealthy man) and to make the bus'ness pass the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, they put into the Testament, <hi>M. Crassus,</hi> and <hi>Q. Hortensius,</hi> two of the most conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable men of the City; as <hi>Ioint-Heirs,</hi> toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with <hi>Themselves.</hi> They did, Both of them, suspect it to be a <hi>Counterfeit</hi>; and yet
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:42735:101"/>
having no hand in it themselves, they were well enough content, to make advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of Other peoples Wickedness. And what then? Is it sufficient that they Themselves had no hand in it? I am of Another Opinion; altho', for the <hi>One</hi> of them, I <hi>lov'd</hi> him while he was alive, and and I do not <hi>hate</hi> the <hi>Other</hi> now he is Dead. But when <hi>Basilius</hi> had made his Sisters Son (<hi>Marcus Satirius</hi>) his <hi>Heir,</hi> and would have had him take his <hi>Vnkles</hi> Name upon him; (I speak of That <hi>Satirius</hi> that to the Shame of the Age had the Patronage of the <hi>Picenians,</hi> and <hi>Sabines</hi>) it was a most unreasonable thing that the Chief men of the City should carry away the <hi>Testators Estate,</hi> and leave nothing to the Right Heir but his <hi>Name.</hi> Now if he stands guilty of an <hi>Injustice,</hi> that neither <hi>keeps off</hi> an Injury from his Friend by way of <hi>Prevention</hi>; nor <hi>Repulses</hi> it when he may, (as we have said in our First Book) what shall we think of him that does not only not Repel an <hi>Injury,</hi> but even Helps it on and promotes it? Nay, for my Own part, let the <hi>Inheritance</hi> be never so <hi>Lawful</hi>; yet if it be gain'd by <hi>Craft, Flattery, Servile Offices,</hi> or <hi>False Pretences</hi>; even That <hi>Lawful Succession</hi> I cannot approve. But in such Cases men are many times extremely misled, in taking One thing to be <hi>Honest,</hi> and Another <hi>Profitable</hi>; for the same Rules holds in Both; And He that is not sensible of This, lies open to all sorts almost of <hi>Fraud,</hi> and <hi>Iniquity.</hi> For whosoever says thus to himself, <hi>This</hi> is <hi>Honest,</hi> 'tis true, but the <hi>Other</hi> is <hi>Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient</hi>; he takes upon him to <hi>divide</hi> those things
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:42735:101"/>
by a <hi>Mistake</hi> that are <hi>coupled</hi> by <hi>Nature</hi>; which opinion is the fountein of all Deceipts, Crimes, and Evil Deeds. Wherefore if a Good man,<note place="margin">No Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of what Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture has Coupled.</note> for the very holding up of a Finger, could get himself made Heir to a Considerable Estate, which he has no Title to; he should not do it, tho' upon a Certainty that no man could ever so much as suspect him for it. But if <hi>M. Crassus</hi> could get an Estate upon the same Terms, upon my Credit he would leap out of his skin at it. But a <hi>Iust,</hi> and such a one as we can allow for a <hi>Good</hi> man, will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver agree to the taking of any thing away from <hi>Another,</hi> and transferring it to <hi>himself</hi>; And whoever wonders at This, does as good as confess himself Ignorant of what a good man is.</p>
            <p>BUT he that will thoroughly examine the Secrets of his Own Soul, will be able to tell himself that only He is a <hi>Good</hi> man,<note place="margin">Who is a Good man.</note> who does as much good to <hi>Others</hi> as he can, and harms <hi>no body</hi> without some Injurious provocation. How's That? He that supplants the Right Heir, to get himself into his place, has not that man as much to answer for as if he had remov'd him by Poyson? But what (will some say) <hi>may not a man Do that which is Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable and Expedient for him?</hi> Yes, yes, If he will take This along with him, that it is not possible for any thing to be <hi>So,</hi> that is <hi>Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just.</hi> He that has not learn'd This Lesson, can never be a <hi>Good</hi> man. I remember, when I was a Boy, I heard my Father speak of <hi>Fim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bria</hi> the <hi>Consul</hi>: who was appointed Judge in the Case of <hi>Marcus Luctatius Pythias,</hi> (a Knight of <hi>Rome,</hi> and a very <hi>Honest man</hi>) who un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook,
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:42735:102"/>
upon the Forfeiture of a Sum of Mony, to prove himself a <hi>Good</hi> man: but <hi>Fimbria</hi> did absolutely refuse to pass Judgment in That matter; least he should either dero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate from the Reputation of a person so much Esteemed, if he gave it Against him, or appear, on the Other side, to Pronounce any man to be Good, considering the Infinite Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances of Qualities, and Offices to make him so, So that neither <hi>Fimbria's Good man,</hi> nor <hi>Socrates</hi>'s, will allow any thing to be <hi>Profitable</hi> that is not <hi>Honest</hi>: And such a man will not only fear to <hi>Do,</hi> but not dare so much as to <hi>Think</hi> any thing which he would not frankly own in Publique. Is it not a Shame now, for <hi>Philosophers</hi> to <hi>Doubt,</hi> where the <hi>Common people</hi> themselves are <hi>Resolv'd</hi>? For the Old Thred<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bare <hi>Proverb</hi> is <hi>Their</hi>'s; when they would ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press a man of an exact Sincerity and Justice, <hi>You may play at</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">A Little Play with the Fingers.</note> Love <hi>with him in the Dark,</hi> they say; and what is the meaning of This, but to teach us, that nothing can be <hi>Expedient</hi> that is not <hi>Honest,</hi> tho' he might gain it, and the World never the Wiser for't? In the Moral of this <hi>Proverb,</hi> we are taught, that neither <hi>Gyge</hi>'s way is to be endur'd, nor so much as a Finger to be mov'd, (as in the case for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly supposed) tho' a man might make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self Master of the whole World by so doing. For whatsoever is <hi>Shameful,</hi> and <hi>Dishonorable,</hi> let it be never so <hi>Secret,</hi> nothing can make it <hi>Honest</hi>; and that which is <hi>not Honest,</hi> it is as impossible to render it <hi>Profitable,</hi> in a <hi>Repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancy</hi> and <hi>Opposition</hi> to <hi>Nature.</hi>

by <hi>Himself alone</hi> of that which was the <hi>Common Act</hi> of the <hi>Court</hi>: which you will find (if you observe the Story) to have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him great Reputation; the people setting up his <hi>Statues</hi> every where up and down, with <hi>Incense,</hi> and <hi>Tapers:</hi> In one word, no man ever render'd himself more <hi>Popular.</hi>

It did not appear to be so very foul, for the <hi>One Marius</hi> to preposses himself of the Favour of the People, by preventing his <hi>Collegues</hi> and the <hi>Tribunes</hi>: And then it was, in appearance, a matter of great Advantage to the <hi>Other Marius</hi> to advance himself to the <hi>Consulship</hi> by the Means he had propounded.

Set your Wits at work, and try, and consider with your self what is the <hi>Image,</hi> the <hi>Character,</hi> and the <hi>Notion</hi> of a <hi>Good Man</hi>?

Can That thing which

How much greater then is the Number of the Unfaithful to That Prince, who having opprest <hi>Rome</hi> it self by a <hi>Roman Army,</hi> and a City, not only <hi>Free</hi> in its own Constitution, but giving Laws to others; brought That City, at last, into subjection to Himself? How ulcerated a Conscience do you think This man must needs have? What wounds in his Soul? Or how is it possible that This mans Life should be Profitable to Himself, when such was the Condition of it, that Poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity will ever have a Veneration, and Esteem for those that took it away?</p>
            <p>NOW if those things that carry the Fairest Appearance of <hi>Profit,</hi> fail yet of being what they seem to be, because they are full of Shame and Dishonour; This, methinks, should Convince any man, that nothing can be <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable,</hi> that is not likewise <hi>Honest.</hi> Now as This has, in Many Cases, been determin'd; so most remarkably, by the Senate of <hi>Rome,</hi> and by <hi>Caius Fabricius,</hi> in his second <hi>Consulate:</hi> For when King <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> made War upon <hi>Rome,</hi> and the Quarrel was <hi>Empire</hi> too, and That with a <hi>Powerful,</hi> and a <hi>Generous Prince</hi>; there came a <hi>Fugitive</hi> from <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> into the Tents of <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bricius</hi>; and promised him, upon Condition of a Considerable Reward, that he would convey himself back, as privately as he came; and Poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son the King. <hi>Fabricius</hi> order'd this man to be carried back to <hi>Pyrrhus</hi>;<note place="margin">

to That hazardous War, in the removal of the most Considerable Enemy of the Empire. But where the point in Controversie was <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,</hi> it would have been a Scandalous and an Impious practice to have encountred a Noble Enemy with <hi>Baseness,</hi> and <hi>Treachery,</hi> instead of <hi>Resolution,</hi> and <hi>Virtue.</hi> Now which was the more Profitable, either to <hi>Fabricius</hi> (who was as Eminent in <hi>Rome,</hi> as <hi>Aristides</hi> was in <hi>Athens</hi>) or to our <hi>Senate</hi> (that never separated Profit from Honour) to subdue an Enemy by <hi>Arms,</hi> or by <hi>Poyson</hi>? If <hi>Empire</hi> be desirable for <hi>Glories</hi> sake, let there be no <hi>Treachery</hi> or <hi>Injustice</hi> in the Attempt: For therein can be no <hi>Glory.</hi> And we must have a care too how we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass <hi>Wealth it self</hi>;<note place="margin">Wealth it self may be Unprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</note> for it can never be <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous</hi> to us with <hi>Infamy.</hi> And therefore it was no Profitable Advice, that of <hi>L.

Case, we must Consult the Means of <hi>Life,</hi> and <hi>Health.</hi> Well! <hi>Suppose a Wise man should be made</hi> Heir to a great Estate, <hi>upon This Obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from the</hi> Testator, <hi>that before he touches one penny of the Profits of it, he should dance pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquely before a Court of Iustice, or in the Market place? He promises accordingly so to do; and without passing That Promise, he could never have been entitled to that Estate:</hi> Should he do it or no? I could wish he had not promis'd it; and my Opinion is, that it would better have become his Gravity not to have done it; but in regard that he has past his Word, if he accounts it a <hi>Shameful,</hi> and <hi>Dishonourable</hi> thing to discharge That Condition, he may break his word with a better Grace by making <hi>no Benefit</hi> of the <hi>Estate,</hi> then <hi>Otherwise</hi>; unless peradventure the Benefits of it might be converted to so Great, and Publique an Advantage, that it would be no longer <hi>Dishonorable</hi> so to do, as being <hi>Profitable</hi> to his <hi>Country.</hi>

How much better had it been if This Promise had never been made, then so horrible a Crime admitted? Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore sometime we should not pass a Promise: Nay a <hi>Depositum</hi> it self is not in all Cases to be restor'd.

Or can any thing be <hi>Profitable</hi> to any <hi>Member</hi> of the <hi>Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique,</hi> that is not so to the <hi>Whole</hi>? It is a Subversion of the <hi>Fundamentals</hi> of <hi>Nature,</hi> to divide <hi>Profit</hi> and <hi>Honesty,</hi> for we do all of us desire that which is <hi>Profitable:</hi> It is an Attra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive that draws us to it, whether we will or no.

So that there was nothing of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi> in the perverting so great a <hi>Profit.</hi> Was it least he should do a <hi>mean</hi> thing?

And <hi>then,</hi> That of <hi>Accius: Hast thou broken thy Faith? To any man that does not believe me, I neither Have given, nor Do give it.</hi> Now tho' this was spoken by a Wicked King, it was yet well enough said: And moreover; as we say that some things appear <hi>Prositable,</hi> which are <hi>not</hi> so; so do they say on the Other side, that some things <hi>appear Honest</hi> too, which are <hi>not</hi> so: As in this case of <hi>Regulus</hi>'s returning to the <hi>Torment,</hi> to save his <hi>Oath:</hi> For it is ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred <hi>Dishonourable,</hi> because it was done under a <hi>Force,</hi> and by an <hi>Enemy,</hi> and so ought not to be made good.

before. This is it which is commonly urg'd aginst <hi>Regulus.</hi> But let us <hi>examin what it amounts to. Iupiter</hi> was not to be fear'd, least he should <hi>hurt</hi> us in his <hi>Anger</hi>; because he does not use to be either <hi>Angry</hi> or <hi>Mischievous.</hi> This Reason lies as strong against all other Oaths, as against This of <hi>Regulus.</hi> But the question is not in an <hi>Oath,</hi> the <hi>fear</hi> of being <hi>punish'd</hi> for <hi>breaking it</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but the <hi>Conscience</hi> and the <hi>Obligation of</hi> keeping it. Now an <hi>Oath</hi> is a <hi>Religious Affirmation</hi> and whatsoever we promise p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="201" facs="tcp:42735:111"/>
the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> without the Authority of the <hi>Senate,</hi> perswaded the representing of it to the People, himself, that he might be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd up to the Enemy; which proposition, being so recommended, by <hi>L. Furius,</hi> and <hi>Sextus Attilius,</hi> was accepted and he accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly deliver'd up. This was more Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable yet, then that of <hi>Q. Pompeius,</hi> who, in the same case, upon his supplication that such a <hi>Decree</hi> might not be past against him, prevail'd, <hi>and was discharg'd.</hi> Here, that which seem'd <hi>Profitable,</hi> was more Consider'd then the <hi>Honest</hi>; but in the <hi>Other Examples; the false Appearance</hi> of <hi>Profit,</hi> was overcome by a Dignity of <hi>Honor,</hi> and <hi>Virtue.</hi> But in the Case of <hi>Regulus,</hi> the Promise was made under a Force, and he was not oblig'd to Perform it. As if any Force could work upon the Mind of a Valiant man: Why did he go to the Senate then, expresly to move against him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and disswade the Release of the Priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners? This is to reprehend the most Generous point in the whole Case, He would not rest upon his own Opinion; but undertook the Cause, that the Senate might pass judgment upon it; wherein if he had not interposed, the Prisoners had been certainly restor'd to the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> and then, <hi>Regulus</hi> might have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinu'd safe in his Own Country. But as he did not account that course <hi>Profitable</hi> to his <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,</hi> so he took the <hi>Honester</hi> Part, in chusing ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to suffer, and undergo what he did. Now as to their saying that when a thing is <hi>very Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable,</hi> the advantage justifies it, tho' it were not <hi>Honest</hi> otherwise: Let me tell you, that
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:42735:112"/>
it must <hi>Be</hi> so, and not be <hi>Made</hi> so: For there is nothing <hi>Profitable,</hi> which is not <hi>Honest,</hi> and it is not <hi>Honest,</hi> because it is <hi>Profitable,</hi> but it is <hi>Profitable,</hi> because it is <hi>Honest.</hi> So that out of many Wonderful Examples, a man shall hardly find a greater, or a more laudable In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance then This. For in the whole Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of <hi>Regulus,</hi> the most Worthy and Generous part of it was his Opinion for the deteining of the Prisoners. For as to his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, tho' we wonder at it now adays, he could not yet at That time do otherwise: So that it was the Glory of the <hi>Age,</hi> rather then of the <hi>Man:</hi> For our Forefathers lookt upon the Tye of an Oath as the most Sacred Obligation in Nature.<note place="margin">The Tye of an Oath.</note> And this we find in the <hi>Twelve Tables</hi>; the Laws which we call <hi>Sacrate,</hi> shew as much: And so do our <hi>Leagues,</hi> by which we are ty'd to keep Faith, even with an Enemy; and so do the <hi>Orders,</hi> and <hi>Penalties</hi> of our <hi>Censors</hi>; who were not so strict in any thing, as in the bus'ness of an <hi>Oath. Lucius Manlius</hi> (the Son of <hi>Aulus</hi>) in his <hi>Dictatorship</hi> was summon'd by <hi>M. Pompo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi> the <hi>Tribune</hi> of the <hi>Common people,</hi> for Exercising the Power of a <hi>Dictator,</hi> some days beyond his time; And was further accus'd for Banishing his Son <hi>Titus</hi> (who was afterward called <hi>Torquatus</hi>) out of the Town, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding him to live in the Country. The Young man, hearing that his Father was in trouble about it, is said to have gone pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently to <hi>Rome</hi>; and the next morning by day-light, to <hi>Pomponius</hi>'s house. To whom it was suggested that <hi>Torquatus</hi> being very Ill

He was no sooner in the Chamb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Such a Venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion had they in those times for the Tye of an Oath! This <hi>Titus Manlius</hi> is the man, who having kill'd a <hi>Frenchman</hi> in a <hi>Duel</hi> upon a Challenge, at the River <hi>Anien,</hi> and taking from him a <hi>Chain,</hi> which the <hi>Latins</hi> call <hi>Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis,</hi> took the <hi>Sirname</hi> of <hi>Torquatus.</hi> In his <hi>Third Consulship</hi> the <hi>Latins</hi> were routed and dispersed at <hi>Veseris,</hi> near the Mountain <hi>Vesu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius.</hi> He was a man of the highest rank of Brave men, and not more eminently Indulgent to his Father, then he was afterward severe to his Son.</p>
            <p>But as <hi>Regulus</hi> was to be commended for keeping of his Oath.<note place="margin">The Seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the <hi>Romans</hi> in case of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidy.</note> So were those <hi>Ten men</hi> after the Battle of <hi>Cannae</hi> as much to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spised. <hi>Hannibal</hi> sent them to the Senate, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on an <hi>Oath</hi> to render themselves again in the Camp of the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> if they could not obtain such an exchange of Prisoners as was propounded. But this Story is variously re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported: <hi>Polybius</hi> (an Author of singular Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit) says that <hi>Nine</hi> of the <hi>Ten Noblemen</hi> that
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:42735:113"/>
were sent, delivered themselves up, without prevailing for the <hi>Exchanges,</hi> but that <hi>One</hi> of the Ten never went back again; Having Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to the Camp, so soon as he was out of it, upon pretence that he had left something be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind him; by which <hi>Return,</hi> he would un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand himself to be discharg'd of his Oath: But without reason; For the <hi>Fraud encreases</hi> the <hi>Iniquity,</hi> without <hi>dissolving</hi> the <hi>Perjury.</hi> Wherefore it was a foolish piece of Cunning, and a most perverse Imitation of Prudence. Hereupon the Senate decreed that this shift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Jugler should be sent bound to <hi>Hannibal.</hi> But the most glorious thing of all was This, <hi>Hannibal</hi> had 8000 Prisoners; not taken in the Battle, or that had run any hazzard of their Lives, but they were only such as were left in the Camp, by the <hi>Two Consuls Paulus</hi> and <hi>Varro.</hi> They might have been redeem'd for a small Sum of Money; but the Senate would not agree to't: for a Lesson to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Soldiers</hi> that they must either <hi>Conquer,</hi> or <hi>Die.</hi> This resolution being made known to <hi>Hannibal,</hi> went more to the heart of him then any thing else (as the same Author has it) to see that the Senate and People of <hi>Rome</hi> in their greatest Adversity, should still uphold so generous a Resolution. So that things <hi>seemingly Profitable</hi> are still overcome by things that are <hi>really honest.</hi> Now <hi>Acilius</hi> that wrote the Story in <hi>Greek</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> reports it, that there were more of them went back to <hi>Hannibal</hi>'s <hi>Camp,</hi> under the same Colour, to deliver them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves from their Oath; and that they were branded for it with all sorts of Ignominy by

the <hi>Censors.</hi> We shall now put an end to This matter; for it is clear, that whatsoever is done with a Timorous, Abject, Mean, and Broken Mind, cannot be Profitable, because it is Flagitious, Dis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The Fourth part yet remains, consisting in <hi>Decency, Moderation, Modesty, Continence,</hi> and <hi>Temperance.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Of Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</note> Now can any thing be <hi>Profitable,</hi> in opposition to this Catalogue of such Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues?

For tho' <hi>Epicurus,</hi>

                  <hi>Epicurus</hi> places Good and Ill in Pleasure and Pein.</note> in many places speaks Generously enough (as he does in This) of <hi>Pein and Affliction</hi>; We are not yet so much to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der what he says, as what may be Reasonable for him to say, upon the Foundation of Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minating all <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Ill,</hi> in <hi>Pleasure</hi> and <hi>Pein:</hi> As to hear him now speak of <hi>Continence</hi> and <hi>Temperance</hi>; he says many very good things in several places; but yet he's gravell'd; (as we say) for how can any man commend <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance</hi>; and yet place our <hi>Chiefest Good,</hi> in <hi>Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure</hi>?

And yet in these Three kinds, they shuffle as well as they can, and their Evasions are not without some Colour. They make <hi>Prudence</hi> to be the skill of supply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or procuring <hi>Pleasures,</hi> and keeping away <hi>Peins:</hi> And then they make a shift too, to acquit themselves in the point of <hi>Fortitude:</hi> which they say enables us to contemn <hi>Death,</hi> and to endure <hi>Pein.</hi> And in speaking of <hi>Temperance</hi>; tho' they are not clear, yet they extricate themselves after a fashion; for they say that the <hi>Greatness</hi> of <hi>Pleasure</hi> arises only from an <hi>Absence</hi> or <hi>Detraction</hi> of <hi>Pein.</hi> And as for <hi>Iustice,</hi> it is with Them, either <hi>Tottering,</hi> or rather <hi>Groveling</hi> upon the <hi>Ground</hi>; and so
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:42735:114"/>
are all those Virtues that are exercis'd in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, and in the Society of Mankind. For there can neither be any Goodness, Liberality, or Gentleness (any more then Friendship) if these things be not desirable for <hi>Themselves</hi>; or else desirable only in relation to <hi>Pleasure,</hi> and <hi>Profit.</hi> But let us bring the matter into a Narrow Compass: For, as we have laid it down that nothing can be <hi>Profitable,</hi> in Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition to <hi>Honesty,</hi> so we do here affirm that all Pleasure is directly Contrary to it. Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which point, I reckon <hi>Calliphon,</hi> and <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomachus</hi> to be the more to blame, in think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to put an end to this Controversie, by cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pling <hi>Pleasure,</hi> with <hi>Honesty,</hi> as if it were a <hi>Man,</hi> with a <hi>Beast.</hi> Whereas Virtue does not admit of That Conjunction, but despises and rejects it. And then for the end of <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Evil men,</hi> which must be <hi>Simple</hi>; it cannot be <hi>Temper'd,</hi> and <hi>Compounded</hi> of <hi>disagreeing things.</hi> But of This elsewhere more at large: And it is a weighty bus'ness. But To my purpose now in hand. Concerning any matter to be deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd in the Case of a <hi>Concurrent Opposition</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt <hi>Profit,</hi> and <hi>Honesty,</hi> we have said enough already. But if <hi>Pleasure</hi> shall be said to carry some shew of <hi>Profit</hi> also, there can be no Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction of it with Honesty. For allowing the most we can to <hi>Pleasure,</hi> it does but serve us for <hi>Sawce,</hi> without any Profit in it at all.</p>
