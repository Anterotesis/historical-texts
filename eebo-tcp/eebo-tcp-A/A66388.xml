            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>This Church could not ceaſe to be ſuch, but ſhe muſt fall either by Apoſtaſie, Hereſie, or Schiſm.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Apoſtaſie is not only a renouncing of the Faith of Chriſt, but the very Name and Title to Chriſtianity: No man will ſay, that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> had ever ſuch a fall, or fell thus.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Hereſie is an adheſion to ſome private and ſingular Opinion, or Errour in Faith, contrary to the general ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved Doctrine of the Church.</p>
            <p>If the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> did ever adhere to any ſingular, or new Opinion diſagreeable to the common received Doctrine of the Chriſtian World, I pray ſatisfie me as to theſe Particulars, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. By what General Council was ſhe ever condemned?</p>
            <p n="2">2. Which of the Fathers ever writ againſt her? Or,</p>
            <p n="3">3. By what Authority was ſhe otherwiſe reproved? For, It ſeems to me a thing very incongruous, that ſo great a Church ſhould be condemned by every one that hath a mind to condemn her.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Schiſm is a departure or diviſion from the Unity of the Church, whereby the Band and Communion held with ſome former Church, is broken and diſſolved.</p>
            <p>If ever the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> divided her ſelf by Schiſm from any other Body of faithful Chriſtians, or brake Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, or went forth from the Society of any elder Church: I pray ſatisfie me as to theſe particulars.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Whoſe company did ſhe leave?</p>
            <p n="2">2. From what Body did ſhe go forth?</p>
            <p n="3">3. Where was the true Church which ſhe forſook?</p>
            <p>For it appears a little ſtrange to me, that a Church ſhould be accounted Schiſmatical, when there cannot be aſſigned any other Church different from her, (which from Age to Age, ſince Chriſt his time, hath continued viſible) from whence ſhe departed.</p>

            <head>To my honoured Friend Mr. <hi>S. B.</hi>
            </head>
            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I had no ſooner peruſed the Paper which I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from you, but I perceived that it was penn'd for the ſake of ſuch, as either are not well acquainted with the matters in Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie betwixt us and the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> or with the Way and Method of arguing. To ſuch as theſe they are wont to pretend high: To thoſe that are ignorant of the former, they talk of Antiquity and Univerſallity; and to ſuch as are unskilful in the latter, of Demonſtrations, and ſelf-evident Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, of Axioms and Definitions. But all this is a meer flouriſh of Words; for if theſe things come ſtrictly to be examined, inſtead of Antiquity we ſhall too frequently find Forgery and Impoſture; inſtead of the <hi>Catholick</hi> Church, the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> inſtead of Demonſtrations and Definitions, Sophiſtry and Fallacious Arguments. And after this ſtrain is this Paper wrote, in which things are ſo artificially mingled, that they look very ſpeciouſly to thoſe that do not underſtand them; and are ſo well fitted to work upon the eaſie, the ignorant, and inconſiderate, that after it had been printed, as I perceive, long ſince in <hi>Fiat Lux,</hi> it is again ſingled out
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:64750:3"/>
to be put into the hands of ſuch as they have a deſign upon. But I ſhall endeavour to unravel it, and hope, by that time that I have done, that what is therein ſaid will appear to be wholly inſufficient to juſtifie their Church, and acquit it of thoſe Crimes it is charged with: And this I ſhall do by ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That the whole is falſe.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That the particulars are very fallacious.</p>
            <p>The former I ſhall make good by theſe following Conſiderations.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That a Church may fall from what it once was.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is not now what it was in Apoſtolical and Primitive times; when it might moſt of all pretend to be (as he calls it) <hi>a moſt pure, excellent, and flouriſhing Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. That the alteration from what it was then, to what it is now, is to the worſe; and that it is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by intolerably corrupted.</p>
            <p>If theſe Propoſitions be proved, then the way taken by our Author will ſignifie nothing; ſince it will not be worth the while to enquire how it is, whether it be fallen by Apoſtaſie, Hereſie, or Schiſm, when it is demonſtrable that ſo it is, that it is fallen.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That a Church may fall from what it once was; that is, from its Primitive Purity and Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity in Faith and Manners, is evident to any that will read the Scriptures, and mind what is therein ſaid of the Churches of the <hi>Jews, Sardis</hi> and <hi>Lao<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicea;</hi> or that are acquainted with Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory. And this they of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> are bound to grant; they muſt acknowledge, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:64750:3"/>
to their own Principles, that we once were a Church when in their Communion; and they call us Apoſtatical, Heretical, and what not, ſince we have forſaken it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is not now what it was in Apoſtolical and Primitive times, but is chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Principles and Practice.</p>
            <p>In Principles, as,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That the Pope is Chriſt's Vicar; that is, that he is the Univerſal King over Chriſt's Flock, and hath a Juriſdiction over all Churches whatſoever, is a new Principle. This the Scripture (which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> of old uſed to appeal to) is ſo far from giving any Countenance to, that our Saviour ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly cautions the Apoſtles againſt any ſuch Uſurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Luk. 22. 25. <hi>When there was a ſtrife among them, which of them ſhould be accounted the greateſt; he ſaid unto them, The Kings of the</hi> Gentiles <hi>exerciſe Lordſhip over them, &amp;c. but it ſhall not be ſo: but he that is the greateſt [or will be great,</hi> Mark 10. 43.] <hi>among you, let him be as the younger,</hi> &amp;c. and in the 30. <hi>v.</hi> ſaith, <hi>ye ſhall ſit upon twelve Thrones,</hi> &amp;c. not preferring one before the other. And leſt what he had occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionally ſpoke to <hi>Peter,</hi> Mat. 16. 19. <hi>Whatſoever thou ſhalt bind on Earth ſhalt be bound in Heaven,</hi> &amp;c. ſhould be miſconſtrued, he doth give the ſame power to the reſt of the Apoſtles, both before his death, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. 18. and alſo after his Reſurrection, <hi>Joh.</hi> 20. 23. And if we would underſtand the ſenſe of Antiquity as to this matter, I know no ſurer nor ſhorter way, than to ſee what is ſaid by the Councils; for then the Fathers may be ſuppos'd to ſpeak moſt impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially and with greateſt authority; and of this I
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:64750:4"/>
ſhall give you a brief account. The firſt general Council was that of <hi>Nise,</hi> called by <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Great, and held <hi>An.</hi> 325. which in the ſixth Canon doth thus decree, <hi>That the Biſhop of</hi> Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria, <hi>and accordingly of</hi> Antioch, <hi>and of other Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, ſhould have power over their own Provinces accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ancient Cuſtom, and the Cuſtom in that caſe of the Church of</hi> Rome; <hi>and that none ſhould invade the Priviledges of each other.</hi> The ſame is ſaid and confirmed in the ſecond Canon of the ſecond gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Council held at <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> by the command of <hi>Theodoſius</hi> the Emperour, <hi>An.</hi> 380. And further ratified by the third general Council at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> in the year 431. <hi>Can.</hi> 8. If we go forward, we ſhall find that it was further decreed in the above-ſaid Council of <hi>Conſtantinople, Can.</hi> 3. <hi>That the Biſhop of</hi> Conſtantinople <hi>ſhould have the order of Primacy next to the Biſhop of</hi> Rome, <hi>becauſe it is New</hi> Rome.</p>
            <p>And what is thereby to be underſtood, is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently declared in the 28<hi>th</hi> Canon of the Fourth General Council aſſembled at <hi>Chalcedon, An.</hi> 451. in which it is decreed, <hi>That the Church of</hi> Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople <hi>ſhould have equal Priviledges with that of</hi> Rome, <hi>there being the ſame Reaſon for that as the other, as it was the Imperial Seat:</hi> and according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is there a particular inſtance given in caſe of Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peals, <hi>Can.</hi> 9. From this Juriſdiction which eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Church had over its own Members, proceeded other Canons; as, <hi>That thoſe who were excluded the Communion of one Church, ſhould not be received by another.</hi> So <hi>Can.</hi> 5. of the aforeſaid Council of <hi>Nice, That no Appeals ſhould be made to foreign or tranſmarine Churches.</hi> So the Council held at <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>levis</hi>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:64750:4"/>
in <hi>Africa</hi> (where S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> was preſent) <hi>An.</hi> 416. which Canon <note n="†" place="margin">L. <hi>2.</hi> de Rom Pon. cap. <hi>24.</hi>
               </note>
               <hi>Bellarmine</hi> confeſſeth was made with a particular reſpect to <hi>Rome.</hi> To the ſame purpoſe the Sixth Council held at <hi>Carthage, an.</hi> 420. (in which alſo S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> was) paſſed a Decree <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Can.</hi> 31.</note>. From all which you may obſerve, 1. That the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> had anciently a limited Juriſdiction, it was over his own Province only. 2. That the Juriſdiction which he had over his own Province, was ſuch as all other Supreme Biſhops had over theirs. 3. That none had a power to tranſgreſs the ancient and ſetled bounds of Juriſdiction, or to invade thoſe of anothers. 4. That the Honour given to the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> (whatever priority it was that he had) was not by any Divine Authority, but as <hi>Rome</hi> was the Imperial Seat. 5. That the Honour and Privilege which it had by that means, was what another was capable of; for the ſame was given to <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople.</hi> 6. That none of theſe Decrees in thoſe General Councils were ever oppoſed by the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> 'till the Council of <hi>Chalcedon.</hi> 7. That at that time the pretences of the Popes Legates were univerſally oppoſed and rejected. And I may add, 8. That what was at any time in thoſe days claimed by the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> was claimed not upon any Divine Authority, but only upon the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Council of <hi>Nice</hi> (as it appears from the tranſactions in the afore-cited Council of <hi>Carthage)</hi> 9. What was then claimed under that pretext, was upon a pretended, if not a forged, Canon of the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> which was detected ſo to be by that Council of <hi>Carthage,</hi> and their Uſurpation rejected,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:64750:5"/>
as is evident from the Acts of that Council, and the Epiſtle written by the Fathers there aſſembled, and Pope <hi>Celeſtine</hi> upon it.</p>
            <p>From all which it appears (and more I could ſhew) that there was no ſuch thing originally, as this Univerſal Paſtorſhip, which the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> doth now challenge, and that <hi>Rome</hi> is therein changed from what it was.</p>
            <p>And now let our Author ask (if he pleaſe) <hi>by what Councils was the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>ever condemned?</hi> And you may anſwer, by the four firſt general Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils. Let him ask again, <hi>which of the Fathers ever wrote againſt her?</hi> And you may anſwer, no leſs than 1068, for ſo many were then concerned in all theſe Four Councils. And if this ſuffice not, we may turn him to the Councils of <hi>Milcvis</hi> and <hi>Carthage</hi> before mentioned, and to others alſo of good Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, beſides particular Fathers. I have been the longer upon this, not only becauſe it could not be well compriſed in leſs, but alſo becauſe if this Claim of theirs fall, their Cauſe muſt fall with it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Another new Principle of theirs is, That the Pope hath at leaſt, <hi>in ordine ad Spiritualia,</hi> a Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er over all Kingdoms within the Church, and of depoſing Kings in caſe of Hereſie, or obſtinacy, &amp;c. and of abſolving Subjects from their Allegiance to them when thus depoſed. That this is the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of their Church is plain, from <hi>Can.</hi> 3. of the Fourth Council of <hi>Lateran,</hi> and from the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of <hi>Trent,</hi> in <hi>Seſſ.</hi> 25. <hi>de reform. c.</hi> 19. where it is ſomewhat covertly expreſſed, for a Reaſon which the ſtate of Affairs at that time made neceſſary. That this is the Doctrine of their Church, is
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:64750:5"/>
proved beyond all contradiction, by the preſent Lord Biſhop of <hi>Lincolne,</hi> in his late Learned Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe <hi>Of Popery,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>But that this Doctrine of theirs is <hi>new,</hi> is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly confeſſed among themſelves, and maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſo to be by ſeveral of their own Communion, and which any one may ſo far receive ſatisfaction in, from what is written by <hi>Roger Widdrington (alias Preſton)</hi> in his <hi>Apologia pro Jure principum,</hi> and his <hi>humilima ſupplicatio ad Paulum Quintum.</hi>

               <hi>3. Tranſubſtantiation was not originally an Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of their Creed as it is now. So it is ſaid by</hi> Jo. Yribarn, <note n="*" place="margin">Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in 4. Sent. ſecti. l. 4. Diſt. 11. Q. 3. di p. 42. Sect. 1.</note>

            <p n="4">4. The Doctrine of Infallibility, reſpecting their
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:64750:6"/>
Church as the Seat of it, was not anciently known, neither claimed by themſelves, nor granted by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; amongſt all the directions given in Scripture for finding out the truth, there is not one word to this purpoſe; and amongſt all the Diſputes in the Primitive Church, we find no ſuch courſe taken for the final determination of them, as the having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to the Apoſtolical Chair of <hi>Rome.</hi> Hereſies were not then ſo ſcarce, nor the confutation of them ſo eaſie, as that this relief ſhould be forgotten. And it ſeems they themſelves did then as little underſtand their own Priviledges, as they did the Principles of Faith; for this was never ſo much as thought of, in all thoſe Councils which were called on purpoſe for the ſuppreſſion of Hereſies, and where the Legats of the Pope were preſent: Nay to this very day, they are at a loſs where to go for it, whether to the Pope, or a Council, or both, or Tradition, or the Collective Body of Chriſtians; that is, they know not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to give up the Cauſe or to maintain it. I muſt confeſs, if I ſhould hear a perſon ſolemnly declare, that he hath Treaſure enough in his poſſeſſion to enrich the whole World, and ſhould gravely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite all perſons to addreſs themſelves to him, but in the mean time perceive (though he hath been of the ſame mind for ſeveral years,) that he can neither tell where it is, nor is he and his Family for all this the richer, or in a better condition than other Folk, I ſhould vehemently ſuſpect him either to be a noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Impoſter or perfect Lunatick. And when we hear the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> confidently aſſerting its own Infallibility, but find withal that ſhe knows not where to fix it, and that its ruptures and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:64750:6"/>
are in the mean time as great as in other Churches, and what are never ended by the way it pretends to, but by plain Turciſm and downright force, I cannot for my heart but think there is more of Intereſt than Reaſon in the caſe, and what they themſelves do rather live by than believe.</p>
            <p>But in my mind there is no better Evidence that this is <hi>new,</hi> than that its falſe; and no better evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence that it is falſe, than that it hath miſtaken. Of which, beſides what hath been or ſhall be far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſaid of alterations in that Church, I ſhall give you two plain Inſtances, The Council of <hi>Trent</hi> 
               <note n="†" place="margin">Seſſ. 4. decr. 1.</note>ſaith, that <hi>Traditions are to be received with equal reverence as the Scriptures;</hi> and <hi>Maldonet</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">Com. in <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. p. 317.</note>tells us, that <hi>The giving the Euchariſt to Children was a Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition in the Church for</hi> 600 <hi>years after Chriſt;</hi> which is now condemned (as he ſhews) by the Council of <hi>Trent.</hi> Again, S. <hi>Hierom</hi> 
               <note n="†" place="margin">In Iſa. c. 6. and c. 8.</note>ſaith, that <hi>the Latine Church then did not receive the Epiſtle to the</hi> Hebrews <hi>amongst the Canonical Scriptures:</hi> But that is now taken into the number by them, and required ſo to be under an Anathema, <hi>Seſſ.</hi> 4. <hi>Decr.</hi> 1. <hi>Counc. Trid.</hi> Now Infallibility and Falli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility are contradictory, and if that Church hath erred (as erred ſhe hath) then ſhe cannot be In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible, and ſo conſequently the Infallibility of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> was not the Principle of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I could ſhew as much of Novelty in the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines of Indulgences, Purgatory, the Maſs's be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Propitiatory Sacrifice, and of no Salvation out of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church, &amp;c. but what I have ſaid I think is ſufficient.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:64750:7"/>
2. The Alterations are as great in point of Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice; the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> differs therein as much from what ſhe originally was: As,</p>
            <p n="1">1. The keeping the Scriptures and Publick Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice in an Unknown Tongue, is new. The firſt is evident from the Tranſlations of the Scripture into ſeveral Languages, and eſpecially into the Latine (at that time a vulgar Tongue) of which no ſufficient Reaſon can be given, were it not for the uſe of thoſe that underſtood not the Originals. The latter is not only clear from 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. but what <hi>Bellarmine</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">De Verbo dei lib. 2. cap. 16.</note>doth acknowledge; who ſaith, <hi>that the cuſtom of the Peoples ſaying,</hi> Amen [that is to what they underſtood] <hi>as they did in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles time, continued long in the Weſtern, as well as Eaſtern Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Worſhipping of Images, which was firſt eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed in the ſecond Council at <hi>Nice,</hi> but is ſo different from and contrary to the practice of the Primitive Church, that <hi>Caſſander</hi> 
               <note n="†" place="margin">Conſult. Artic. <hi>21.</hi> ſect. <hi>4.</hi>
               </note>(an Author of theirs) ſaith, <hi>that the Chriſtians had not then ſo much as Images in their Churches;</hi> and doth further declare from <hi>Origen,</hi> that the Ancients <hi>ab omni veneratione</hi> (the very word uſed by the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of <hi>Trent, Seſſ.</hi> 25. <hi>decret. de Invocat.) ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginum abhorr<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>erunt,</hi> that all veneration of them was abhorred. To this I refer the worſhipping of Saints, which was ſo little thought of, that many of the Fathers did not think that the Souls of any ſhould enjoy the beatiſick Viſion, and be in a ſtate of happineſs till the Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, as <hi>Stapleton</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">Deſenſ. Eccl. cont. <hi>Whitaker,</hi> l. <hi>1.</hi> c. <hi>2.</hi> Tom. <hi>1.</hi> p. <hi>868.</hi>
               </note>doth ſhew. And it ſeems not to have been an Article of Faith in the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:64750:7"/>
time of <hi>Lombard</hi> or <hi>Scotus,</hi> the former of which ſaith <note n="†" place="margin">Sent. l. <hi>4.</hi> diſt. <hi>45.</hi>
               </note>
               <hi>it's not incredible the Saints do hear what we ſay;</hi> and the latter <note n="*" place="margin">In <hi>4.</hi> diſt. Q. <hi>45.</hi>
               </note>that <hi>it's probable God doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal our prayers that are offered unto them.</hi> It was then the Doctrine of probability only, but now are required to believe it under an Anathema by the Council of <hi>Trent.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>As much is to be ſaid concerning the innovation of Worſhip to the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> of which we read nothing in Scripture or Antiquity, unleſs in what was practiſed by the Hereticks, called <hi>Colyridiani</hi> in <hi>Epiphanius</hi> 
               <note n="†" place="margin">

Let</hi> Mary <hi>be in honour, but let the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghoſt be worſhipped; let no man worſhip</hi> Mary.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Communion in one Kind expreſly contrary to the Scripture, and the practice of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church. The former is acknowledged by the Council of <hi>Conſtance</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Seſſ.</hi> 13.</note>when they decreed notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding for it. The latter is acknowledged by <hi>Caſſander</hi> 
               <note n="†" place="margin">
                  <hi>Artic.</hi> 22.</note>, who ſaith, <hi>that the Roman Church it ſelf retained the practice of receiving in both Kinds, for above one thouſand years after Chriſt, as is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent from innumerable teſtimonies of ancient Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To theſe I might add the practice of ſaying pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate and ſolitary Maſſes, of the Adoration of the Hoſt, and carrying it about in Proceſſion, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:64750:8"/>
(as uſed in their Church) &amp;c. but I ſhall forbear.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Theſe alterations are to the worſe, and groſs Corruptions. For if the Pope is not Chriſt's Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>car originally, and by his Deputation, then he is a great Uſurper. If he hath not a Power over Kings, to depoſe them, and abſolve their Subjects from Allegiance to them, he is a notorious diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the World. If their Church be not Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible, and can no more penetrate into or reſolve and determine points of Faith than another, they are great Impoſtors. If Tranſubſtantiation be a Doctrine of their own and not of Chriſt's, they are great Deceivers. If the Scriptures are free to all, then their Church is guilty of the damnation of all amongſt themſelves, that periſh through the want of knowing and underſtanding them; and of all the ignorance in the Chriſtian World which proceeds from that Cauſe. If worſhipping Images, Saints and Angels, the Hoſt, and Relicks, be not Chriſtian Doctrine, and that theſe are no lawful Objects of ſuch Worſhip, then they are Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters. If Chriſtians are obliged to partake of the Wine as well as the Bread in the Lords Supper, then they are tyrannical that deny and forbid it. In fine, they that do ſuch things are Enemies to the Kingdom of Chriſt and the Chriſtian World.</p>
            <p>If all this be true, that a Church may fall from what it once was, and be alter'd to the worſe, and that theirs is ſo, then we need not ſpend time in diſputing what <hi>Apoſtaſie, Hereſie,</hi> and <hi>Schiſm</hi> is, upon which he may talk prettily and ſubtilly; or
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:64750:8"/>
by which of them that Church is fallen, as long as fallen ſhe is. But yet, to clear the matter of all wrangling Diſputes, I ſhall conſider theſe things alſo; and ſhew,</p>
            <p n="2">2. That the Particulars are very fallacious; which will appear from the conſideration of the ſeveral terms.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Most pure, excellent, flouriſhing Mother Church;</hi> of all which little or nothing is ſaid in the places of Scripture quoted by him in the Margin. If we conſult the Epiſtle to the <hi>Romans,</hi> there referred to, we ſhall find, That it was ſo far from being at that time a <hi>flouriſhing Church,</hi> that it is there not once ſo much as called a Church. The Apoſtle directs two Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles to the Church in <hi>Corinth,</hi> and two to the Church of the <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> and one to the Churches of <hi>Galatia;</hi> but to the <hi>Romans</hi> he writes thus, <hi>Ch.</hi> 1. <hi>v.</hi> 7. <hi>To all that be in</hi> Rome, <hi>beloved of God, called to be Saints;</hi> as if they were yet Converts at large, without any other ſetled Conſtitution, than what was in the Houſe of <hi>Aquila,</hi> which he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore calls a Church, <hi>Ch.</hi> 16. <hi>v.</hi> 5. And therefore <hi>Salmeron,</hi> aware of it, thinks St. <hi>Paul</hi> would not call them a Church purpoſely, <hi>becauſe of the Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that were there at that time betwixt the</hi> Jews <hi>and</hi> Gentiles. <hi>Tom.</hi> 13. in <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. <hi>diſp.</hi> 7. <hi>p.</hi> 299. <hi>col.</hi> 2.</p>
            <p>But if we ſhould grant it a Church; yet how doth that, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 8. prove that it was <hi>flouriſhing,</hi> when it's only ſaid there, <hi>Your Faith is ſpoken of throughout the whole World;</hi> and in <hi>Ch.</hi> 16. <hi>v.</hi> 19. (for I ſuppoſe that is the other place he would refer
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:64750:9"/>
to) <hi>Your obedience is come abroad unto all Men;</hi> by which doubtleſs no more is to be underſtood, but that the Converſion of many to Chriſtianity in that City was ſpread throughout the <hi>Roman</hi> World; and did tend much to the propagation of it, as that City was then the Imperial Seat. This is the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication given of this place by ſome of their own Writers, <hi>viz. Rigaltius,</hi> in his Notes upon St. <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian, Epiſt. p.</hi> 78. and <hi>Tolet</hi> who in <hi>c.</hi> 1. <hi>ad Rom. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not.</hi> 16. calls it a true <hi>Expoſition,</hi> and ſaith it's to be underſtood as 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1. 8.</p>
            <p>As for the term <hi>Mother,</hi> I hope he means not that the Goſpel firſt came from thence; for in that ſenſe ſhe was a Daughter, and not a Mother. And if any Church could pretend to any Authority from that conſideration, it muſt be <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> which in this ſenſe was the <hi>Mother of us all.</hi> But if he means thereby, that ſhe was an Original and Apoſtolical Church, planted by the Apoſtles, or in Apoſtoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal times (for ſo <hi>Tertullian</hi> uſeth theſe Words alike <hi>lib. de proſcript. cap.</hi> 21. when he calls them <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trices &amp; Originales Eccleſiae,</hi> and again <hi>Eccleſiae Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolicae)</hi> then ſuch alſo was <hi>Epheſus</hi> in <hi>Aſia,</hi> and <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth</hi> in <hi>Achaia,</hi> &amp;c. as <hi>Tertullian</hi> there ſhews, <hi>c.</hi> 32. and 36. of which Churches it will be hard for him to find any thing remaining, and which, while they did remain, he muſt acknowledg to have fallen and been groſly corrupted. And therefore <hi>Rome</hi>'s being a <hi>Mother</hi> Church, in this ſenſe, is no ſecurity againſt <hi>Apoſtaſie, Hereſie</hi> and <hi>Schiſm.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Apoſtaſie,</hi> he ſaith, <hi>is a renouncing not only the Faith of Chriſt, but the very Name and Title to</hi>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:64750:9"/>
               <hi>Chriſtianity.</hi> This indeed is Apoſtaſie with a Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; but as it is no more than a Branch or particular kind of it, ſo it can be no compleat or true definition of it. It being juſt as if he ſhould ſay, that Theft is the violent and forcible taking away of another Man's Goods; which indeed is the higheſt degree of it, and what we uſually call Robbery; but there are other ſorts of Theft beſides; and though it be never ſo ſurreptitiouſly and clande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinely done, it is as well Theft, and a breach of the Eighth Commandment as the other. So it is in the preſent caſe; the higheſt degree of Apoſtaſie is a renouncing the very name of Chriſtian, the turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a <hi>Renegado,</hi> a <hi>Turk,</hi> or <hi>Jew:</hi> But that is Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaſie alſo, when there is a departure from the Faith of Chriſt, or from any great Article or Articles of it. And ſo far a perſon may be truly an Apoſtate, and yet <hi>retain the Name and Title to Chriſtianity.</hi> I muſt confeſs, I always took thoſe to be Apoſtates, whom the Apoſtle ſpeaks of, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 1. that <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from the Faith of Chriſt,</hi> who yet ſeem to have continued in the profeſſion of it. And I am apt to believe Antichriſt will be thought an Apoſtate; and yet it's the Opinion of many among themſelves, that he ſhall retain the name of Chriſtian. But if this will not do, I muſt refer him to the <hi>Bulla Coenae</hi> of <hi>Paul</hi> the Fifth, where its ſaid in the firſt Article of it, <hi>Excommunicamus, &amp;c. We Excommunicate and anathematize, &amp;c. all</hi> Huſſites, Wickleviſts, Luthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rans, Zuinglians, Calviniſts, Hugonots, Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts, Trinitarians, &amp; <hi>à Chriſtianâ ſide Apoſtatas, ac omnes &amp; ſingulos alios Haereticos, &amp;c. and all Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates</hi>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:64750:10"/>
               <hi>from the Chriſtian Faith, and all other Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,</hi> &amp;c. which is doubtleſs ſpoken of ſuch as have not, nor are ſuppoſed to have renounced the Name and Title to Chriſtianity. So that either the Pope in one of his moſt ſolemn Bulls is miſtaken, or this Gentleman: And if we take to the former, as I hope he either in modeſty, or for a more important rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon which he is privy to, will allow, then the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> may be fallen by Apoſtaſie, though ſhe doth retain the Name and Title, and will needs be the only Church of Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Hereſie,</hi> he ſaith, <hi>is an adheſion to ſome private or ſingular Opinion or Errour in Faith, contrary to the general approved Doctrine of the Church.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we admit this Definition, there are a great many things to be conſidered; as firſt, that the relation which he makes Hereſie to have to the Doctrine of the Church, is not current amongſt themſelves. For many of them do ſay, that He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie is <hi>nihil aliud quàm Error in rebus fidei cum pertinacia, Hereſie is nothing elſe than an Error in the matters of Faith with obſtinacy,</hi> as <hi>Sayrus</hi> acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in his <hi>Clavis Sacerdotum l.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 9. <hi>n.</hi> 34. and <hi>Durand</hi> is of the ſame mind (notwithſtanding what <hi>Sayrus</hi> ſaith of him to the contrary) as appears <hi>l.</hi> 4. <hi>diſt.</hi> 13. <hi>Q.</hi> 5. where he makes the reſpect which Hereſie hath to the Church, to be <hi>becauſe the Church is conſtituted, per unitatem fidei, by the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Faith:</hi> So that according to theſe, the reſpect which Hereſie hath to the Church, is only from the reſpect which the Church hath to the Faith: And to find out what Hereſie is, we muſt
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:64750:10"/>
enquire not what the Church is, but what is the Faith. And if ſo, a Church, even that of <hi>Rome,</hi> may fall by Hereſie, though ſhe may hold the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral approved Doctrine of the Church. But I doubt if we ſhould admit the whole, and yet take it in any ſenſe but one, <hi>viz.</hi> for the general approv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Doctrine of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in the laſt Ages of it, that we ſhall find her guilty in this point alſo. Shall the Church be taken for the Primitive Church three or four hundred years after our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, then they are guilty of Hereſie who will have the Pope to be Chriſts Vicar, and to have Juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on over all Churches; that do maintain worſhipping of Images, Angels and Saints to be lawful and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, &amp;c. contrary to the general approved Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of thoſe Ages. Should we take the Church, for the Church Catholick in any Age (as <hi>Caſſander</hi> doth; <hi>Conſult. Artic.</hi> 22.) that is, the Congregation of Chriſts faithful people all over the World, then ſtill <hi>Rome</hi> would fall into the ſame Condemnation, ſince that ſhe is but a little part in compariſon of the whole. Should we take <hi>Church</hi> again for the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh</hi> Church in the firſt Ages of Chriſtianity, it would then alſo condemn it ſelf, as I have before ſhewed. And I ſee no way for them, even ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to this definition, (which is perfectly one of their own making) to avoid this imputation, but by ſtifly maintaining, that they thereby underſtand the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> for ſome Ages laſt paſt; if that will do; and then we know where to find them, and what to underſtand when they talk of the Church.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb facs="tcp:64750:11"/>
4. <hi>Schiſm,</hi> he ſaith, <hi>is a departure from the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of the Church whereby the Band and Communion held with ſome former Church is broken.</hi> This is as lame and fallacious a definition as any of the reſt. For by foyſting in that word <hi>Former,</hi> which he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter runs upon, he reſtrains it to one particular Branch of Schiſm; and its juſt as if he ſhould ſay, <hi>A Church is an Aſſembly of Chriſtians that join in Communion with each other in the City of</hi> Rome; which none will allow to be a ſufficient definition of a Church: For that term added, <hi>In the City of</hi> Rome, doth no more than prove that the Aſſembly of Chriſtians there met is a Church; but is no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition of a Church; for then no Church could be out of the City of <hi>Rome,</hi> and every Church, if it be a Church, muſt be in that City and no where elſe, if that be a true definition of it. So it is here, the word <hi>Former</hi> added to the definition of Schiſm here given, doth prove no more than that a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture from the Unity of a Former Church is a ſpecies and ſort of Shciſm, but is no adaequate de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition of it. For if it is, then no Church can be guilty of Schiſm, that doth, how unwarrantably ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, refuſe to hold Communion with, or doth break off from the Communion of a Church that was not a Church before it. And conſequently, though the Church of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> had denied to hold Communion with any Church whatſoever (though it were even with the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf) ſhe could not be guilty of Schiſm, becauſe ſhe was the firſt Church, and none was prior to her. And we alſo ſhould be quit of that blame (if we
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:64750:11"/>
had nothing elſe to ſay for our ſelves) for as much as a Church was founded here in <hi>Brittain</hi> two years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that of <hi>Antioch;</hi> and St. <hi>Peter</hi> was ſeven years at <hi>Antioch</hi> before he preſided at <hi>Rome,</hi> as <hi>Baronius</hi> ſaith, <hi>An.</hi> 35. <hi>Num.</hi> 5. and <hi>An.</hi> 39. <hi>Numb.</hi> 23. from whom and from which time they pretend alone to derive their Supremacy.</p>
            <p>And now this will hold, although the Church thus ſeparated from had given no reaſon or colour at all for it. For according to the definition of our Author, it muſt be a <hi>Former Church</hi> which the departure muſt be from to make it Schiſm. We may indeed ſay that Schiſm is when the Band or Communion held with any Church, is (without juſt reaſon) broken and diſſolved; becauſe all Chriſtian Churches ought to maintain Communion with each other, where it may be had: But if ſo, then the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is the moſt Schiſmatical in the World, that denies Communion with all Churches that are not in all <hi>Tridentine</hi> points one with her.</p>
            <p>If you now, Sir, reflect upon his Scheme and frame of Arguments, you will ſee that they hold in nothing which he produceth them for.</p>
            <p>For what will it ſignifie if it be granted that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> was once a moſt pure, flouriſhing Church, if ſhe be now abominably corrupted? What if ſhe was a Mother Church planted by the Apoſtles, and watered with their Doctrine, and their Blood, when ſhe now preacheth another Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine than ſhe was taught by them, and hath groſly corrupted that Faith which they did there
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:64750:12"/>
eſtabliſh. What if ſhe was a Mother Church to ſome other Churches, yet, that as it gives her no Authority over thoſe whom ſhe was not in any ſenſe a Mother to, ſo even not over ſuch as ſhe might pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend that Relation to, when ſhe is now not to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached to, or held Communion with, without apparent hazard of Salvation; and is fallen from thoſe Principles and that Faith which ſhe at their firſt converſion inſtructed them in? When ſhe is fallen by Apoſtaſie, Hereſie, and Schiſm.</p>
            <p>By Apoſtaſie, as ſhe hath forſaken the Primitive Church, and is not now what ſhe originally was, either in Faith or Manners.</p>
            <p>By Hereſie, as ſhe hath received new Articles of Faith, that were not ſuch before, and ſo obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately perſiſted therein, that ſhe hath turned the Anathema upon all Diſſenters in thoſe points from her. Such Articles ſhe hath embraced and doth now hold, as have been <hi>condemned by Councils, wrote againſt by the Fathers, and reproved by Authority.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Some of theſe ſhe was particularly charged with, and reproved for; and in others ſhe is as much concerned, as if particularly charged, becauſe ſhe hath embraced thoſe things which were by them condemned. For if the things and principles were condemned, whoever holds them is as much ſo condemned by that Authority, as if particularly named. As they will acknowledge, that if a Church now in Communion with them ſhould fall off from them, ſhe is thereby as much under the <hi>Anathema</hi> of the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> as if ſhe had at the meeting of that Council been ſo far faulty, and thereby been particularly condemned.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:64750:12"/>
By Schiſm ſhe is fallen, as ſhe denies Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with all other Churches in the World, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they were ſo before ſhe was a Church, or were Churches converted and eſtabliſhed at the ſame time with her, or that have embraced the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Faith ſince ſhe did. The company of ſuch ſhe hath left: From theſe Bodies ſhe is gone forth: And theſe were the true Churches which ſhe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſook. So that ſhe will be found as often guilty of Apoſtaſie as there are particulars of Faith, Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, Worſhip, and Manners, which ſhe is fallen from the Primitive Church in. As often of Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, as ſhe hath new Principles of Faith, and which the Church was not then acquainted with. As often of Schiſm, as there are Churches in the World, that ſhe will not hold Communion with, only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they will not embrace thoſe Principles, or join with her in thoſe practices which ſhe holds con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to them, and with them to the Primitive Church.</p>
            <p>And thus, Sir, I have made good, I hope, what I firſt undertook, and if thereby any ſervice can be done to you or our Religion, it will be a great ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to,</p>
