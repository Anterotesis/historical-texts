         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>¶ To the Right worshipfull Esquier maister Iohn Yong, Grace and health.</head>
            <p>I Haue penned for your master<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ships pleasure one of the sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries which maister Streamer tolde the last Christmas, and which you so faine wold haue heard reported by master Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res him selfe. And although I be vnable to penne or speake it so pleasantly as he could, yet haue I so nerely vsed both the order and wordes of him that spake them, which is not the least vertue of a reporter that I doubt not but that he and maister VVillot shal in the reading thinke they heare master Strea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer speake, and he him selfe in the like acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on shall doubt whether he speaketh or rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth. I haue deuided his oration into three partes, and put the argument before them, and an instruction after them with such notes as might be gathered therof: so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it booke like, and intituled. <hi>Be ware the Cat.</hi> But because I doubt whether master Streamer wilbe contented that other men plowe with his oxen, I meane penne such thinges as he speaketh, which perhaps hee
<pb facs="tcp:17809:4"/>
would rather do him selfe to haue (as he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serueth) the glory of both therfore I besech you to learne his mind herein. And if he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree it passe in such sorte, yet that he peruse it before the Printing, and amend it if in any poynt I haue mistaken him. I pray you likewise to aske master Ferres his iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment herein, and shewe him that the cure of the great plague of master Sreamers translation out of the Arabicke, which hee sent me from Margets, shalbe Imprinted assone as I may conueniently. And it I shall perceaue by your tryall, that master Strea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer allowe my endeuours in this kinde, I will hereafter as Plato did by Socrates penne such things out of the rest of our Christmas communications, as shalbe to his great glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, and no lesse pleasure to all them that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire such kinds of knowledge. In the meane while I besech you accept my good will, and learne to beware the Cat. So shal you not only performe that I seke but also please the Almightie who alwayes pres you:</p>

            <head>The Argument.</head>
            <p>IT chaunced that at Christmas last I was at the Court with master Ferres then master of the Kyngs maiesties pastimes about the setting forth of certaine enterludes, which for the kynges recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion we had deuised and were in learning. In which time among many other exercises among our selues we vsed nightly at our lodging to talke of sundry thinges for the furtheraunce of such offices wherin ech man as than serued. For which purpose it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed master Ferres to make me his bedfellowe, and vpon a pallet cast vpon the rushes in his owne cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber to lodge master willot and. M. Streamer, the one his Astronimor the other his diuine. And among many other thinges to long to reherse, it hapned on a night which I thinke was the. xxviij. of Decem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber after that M. Ferres was come from the court and in bead, there fell a controuersie betwene M. Streamer who with M. willot had already slept his first slepe, and I that was newly come to bead the effect wherof was whether birdes and beastes had reason, the occasion wherof was this. I had heard that the kings players were learning a play of Esops Crow, wherin the most parte of the actors were birdes, the deuice wherof I discommended, saying it was not commicall to make eyther spechles things to speake, or brutish things to common rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonably. And although in a tale it were suffreable to Imagine and tel of somthing by them spoken or rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonably done, which kind Esop laudably vsed, yet it was vncomly sayd I and without example of any author to bring them in liuly peirsonages to speake, do, reason, and alaege au<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">

wakened with our talke harkened to vs, but would take parte on neither side. And whan M. Strea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer had for profe of his assercion declared many thinges of Oliphants that walked vppon cordes, Hedgehogges that knewe alwayes what weather would come, Fores and Dogges that after thoy had bene all night abrode killing Geese and Sheepe would come home in the morning &amp; put their neckes into their collers, Parates that bewayled their ke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers death, Swallowes that with Selandine open their young ones eyes, and an hundred things more which I denied to come of reason, and to be but na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall kindly actions, alleging for my profe authority of most graue and learned Philosophers, well quod master Streamer I know what I know, and I speake not onely what by hearsay of some Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers I knowe, but what I my selfe haue proued. why (quod I then) haue you profe of beastes and fowles reason? yea (quod he) I haue heard them &amp; vnderstand them both speake and reason aswel as I here &amp; vnderstand you: at this M. Ferres laughed. But I remembring what I had read in Albertes workes, thought there might be somwhat more than I knew, wherfore I asked him what beastes or fowles he had heard, and where and whan: At this he pawsed a while, &amp; at last sayd: If I thought you could be content to heare me, and without any interruption till I haue done to marke what I say, I would tel you such a story of one piece of my own<gap reason="illegible: over-inked" extent="1 letter">
