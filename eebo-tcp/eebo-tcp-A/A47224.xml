            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <hi>An Exhortation to young</hi> Philotheus.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>F you have any regard, good <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theus,</hi> to your own eternal happiness, it ought to be your chiefest care to serve and glorifie God. 'Tis for this end God both made and redeemed you, and two excellent rules He hath given you in Holy Scripture, by the conscientious observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of which, you will be able, through His grace, to dedicate your tender years to His glory.</p>
               <p>The one teaches you what you are to do, <hi>Remember</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Eccles. 12. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>now thy Creator in the days of thy youtb.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The other teaches you what you are to avoid, <hi>Fly</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2 Tim. 2. 22.</note> 
                  <hi>youthful lusts;</hi> that is, all those sins which are usually in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident to young persons.</p>
               <p>You cannot imagine the unspeakable advantages
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:50668:3"/>
a pious youth gains by the practice of these two Rules; and how many ghostly dangers that Soul escapes, which is seasoned betimes with the fear of God, before he is sullied with ill Company, before he hath contracted vitious habits, which will cost him infinite pains to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learn, before his affections are too far engaged in the World, to be easily recalled, and before the Devil hath got too strong a hold in him, to be suddenly dispos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed.</p>
               <p>O <hi>Philotheus,</hi> do but ask any one old Penitent, what fruit, what satisfaction he hath purchast to himself, by all those pleasures of sin, which slattered him in his youth, and of which he is now ashamed. Will he not sadly tell you, he has found them all, to be but vanity, and vexation of Spirit? How will he befool himself, for the many good opportunities he hath lost, and wish a thousand times, that he were to live over his mispent days again? And how bitterly will he with <hi>David,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wail the sins of his youth? <note place="margin">Psal. 25. 7</note>
               </p>
               <p>Learn then, good <hi>Phil.</hi> by the dear-bought expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of others, to accustom your self, to bear Christs yoke from your youth, and his yoke will sit easie on your neck; for your duty will grow natural to you, by beginning betimes.</p>
               <p>Do but consider, how welcome a young Convert is to God; it was to young <hi>Samuel</hi> that God revealed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and that at such a time too, when the Word of <note place="margin">1 San. 3. 1.</note> God was pretious, and very rare, to shew how much God honoured a young Prophet; and you know that St. <hi>John,</hi> the youngest of all the Disciples, is the only person of all the twelve; who was permitted to lean on our Saviours bosome, at the last Supper, as dearest to Him in affection, and who is emphatically called, the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciple whom Jesus loved: and this is suitable to that <note place="margin">John 13. 23.</note> gracious promise, which God hath made to encourage all young persons to serve him; <hi>I love them that love me,</hi>

for if you do seek, you are sure to find Him; you are sure, when you have found Him, He will love you, and you shall reap, all the happy effects of Gods infinite Love, and of an early Piety.</p>
               <p>An early Piety! then which, nothing will make you a greater comfort to all your friends, or a greater blessing, to the very Colledge where you are bred; nothing will make you more universally esteemed, and beloved by all men, or more successful in your Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies; and besides, that peace of Conscience, and the pleasure of well-doing, you will at present feel; think if you can, how unconceivable a joy it will be to you, when in your elder years, you can reflect on your well spent time, and the innocence of your Youth; how great a Consolation it will be to you, on your death-bed, how easie it will render your ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts, at the great Day of Judgment, and how much a whole life spent in Gods service, will increase your glory in Heaven.</p>
               <p>God of his great mercy, <hi>Philotheus,</hi> make these and the like considerations, effectual to create, holy Reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions in you, and give you grace, to make good use of these following Directions, which are designed to teach you, to fear the Lord from your youth, and are <note place="margin">1 King. 18 12.</note> suited to your particular Age, and Condition, in hope they may the more affect you.

               <p>But first, if you have time, I advise you to read be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore second Peal, some short Psalm, or piece of a Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter, out of the Gospels, or Historical Books, because they are the most easie to be understood; Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring the example of young <hi>Timothy,</hi> who was bred up <note place="margin">2 Tim. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </note> to know, the Scripture from a Child.</p>
               <p>But if you want time on ordinary days, to read the Scripture, be sure to read somewhat of it on Sundays, and Holy-days; and consider, that you have it dayly read to you in the Hall before Dinner and Supper, and at night when you are just going to Bed, that you may close the day with holy thoughts; and if you hearken diligently to it when it is read, you do in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect read it your self.</p>
               <p>Now to make your reading, the more profitable to you, begin with one, or more, of these Ejaculations.</p>

               <p>Lord open my eyes, that I may see the wonderful things of Thy Law!</p>
               <p>O heavenly Father! I humbly beg Thy Holy Spirit, so to help me at this time to read, and understand, and remember, and practise Thy Word, that it may make me wise to salvation!</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="12" facs="tcp:50668:8"/>
When you are thus prepared, good <hi>Phil.</hi> then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to read, and consider, that it is Gods most holy Word you read; and that all the while you are read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, God is speaking to you, and therefore read with attention, and humility, and endeavour as much as you can, to suit your affections to the Subject you read.</p>
               <p>For instance, If you read any of Gods commands, they should excite in you a zeal to keep them.</p>
               <p>If you read any of Gods threatnings against sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, or his judgments on them, they should excite in you a fear to provoke him.</p>
               <p>When you read any of his gracious promises, they should encourage and quicken your obedience.</p>
               <p>When you read any of Gods mercies, they should excite you to thanksgiving.</p>
               <p>When you read any great mystery, recorded in holy Writ, you are to prostrate your Reason to Divine Revelation.</p>
               <p>And to this purpose in the midst of your Reading, say,</p>
               <l>Lord give me grace to obey this command; <hi>Or,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Lord deliver me from this sin, or this judgment; <hi>Or,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Lord I relie on this good promise; <hi>Or,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Glory be to Thee, O Lord, for this mercy; <hi>Or,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Lord I believe and adore this mystery.</l>
               <p>Say any of these, according as best agrees with the subject you read; and when you have read as much as conveniently you can, conclude with one of these Ejaculations.</p>

               <head>Directions for the Day time.</head>
               <p>O <hi>Philotheus,</hi> you cannot enough thank God for the order of the place you live in, where there is so much care taken to make you a good Christian as well as a good Scholar, where you go so frequently to Prayers every day, in the Chappel, and in the School; and sing Hymns and Psalms to God so frequently in your Chamber, and in the Chappel, and in the Hall, so that you are in a manner brought up, in a perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuity of prayer.</p>
               <p>Be sure <hi>Phil.</hi> that you are accountable to God for all these opportunities He gives you of serving Him; and think how many blessings for your self, and for the Colledge you might obtain, if you prayed and praised God, rather out of a devout affection, then meerly to comply with the custom of the place.</p>
               <p>Prayer, good <hi>Phil.</hi> is the very life of a Christian, and therefore we are so frequently commanded to pray without ceasing: Not that we can be always on our knees, but that we should accustom our selves to fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent thoughts of God, that where-ever we are He sees us; and when we think on God, we should have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways an ejaculation ready to offer up to Him, and by this means we may pray, not only seven times a day with <hi>David,</hi> but all the day long. <note place="margin">

               </p>
               <p>In your reading holy Scripture, especially in the Psalms, you may easily gather those short sentences which most affect you, for they are most proper for this use; and when you have learned them without Book, say one of them now and then, as they occur to your mind, or as occasion requires, or as your devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion prompts you.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="14" facs="tcp:50668:9"/>
But be not troubled, if being otherwise lawfully im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed, or if being indisposed, you pass a whole day without saying any, for to omit them is no sin; nor be you scrupulous in what posture you say them, for they being short breathings of the soul to God, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire not that solemnity, as Set Prayer does.</p>

                  <head>Rules to be observed in Examination.</head>
                  <p>Having prayed for Gods assistance, doubt not <hi>Phil.</hi> but he will vouchsafe it you, and to guide you in your examination the better, observe these following di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections.</p>
                  <p>When you examine your self, either by the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Catalogue, or by that in the Whole Duty of Man, or by any other. Pause a while on every par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular; and if you find your self not guilty, then say, Glory be to Thee, O Lord, for preserving me from this sin! and so go on.</p>
                  <p>When your Conscience answers guilty, then it will be your best way, having said, Lord have mercy upon me, and forgive me this sin, to write down that sin in a Paper, that you may have it ready to confess to God, when your Examination is done.</p>
                  <p>You are to consider <hi>Phil.</hi> that there are several de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of young Penitents, and some are more, some less sinful. For instance:</p>
                  <p>Some t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>re are, who either through want of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scien<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ous Parents, or through often sti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ling good mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s, or through Inconstancy, or Heedlessness, or Unadvisableness, or Vitious Company, or Ill Nature, or Youthful Lusts, and the like, have been from their Infancy very negligent of Learning, or at least of pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctising, their Duty.</p>
                  <p>Again, Some there are amongst these, whose sins are more heinous then ordinary, in regard they are accompanied with several aggravations: For any sin is Much aggravated, if it be committed Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, or Deliberately, or Frequently: More then
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:50668:13"/>
that, if it be committed Obstinately, or presumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously, or on slight, or no temptations, or against Checks of Conscience, or against Reproofs, or Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monitions, or Chastisements, or Vows to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; but most of all, If it be committed so long, and so often, till it becomes habitual, till the sinner does take delight in it, or boast of it, or make a Mock at it, or tempt others also to commit it. All these and the like Circumstances, do very much heighten the guilt of any sin.</p>
                  <p>You may easily from hence guess, what progress you have made in wickedness, and if you find your self in the number of any of these, by all means, good <hi>Phil.</hi> Resolve to repent immediately, and to confess your sins with all their aggravations; for be sure of this, that every other step you run farther from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, every other hour you continue longer in a sinful course, makes your sins the more hard to be mastered, and your repentance the more difficult.</p>
                  <p>On the other side, some there are, though I fear but few, who having been brought up in the Nurture and admonition of the Lord, have been by the goodness of God, secured from violent temptations, and enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous <note place="margin">Chron. 4. 3.</note> sins; who have like <hi>Josiah,</hi> while they were yet young, sought the Lord, and have in a great measure kept their baptismal vow, and preserved a sense of their duty.</p>
                  <p>Such as these, have fewer sins to confess, and those sins less aggravated, and therefore have greater obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations, to Magnifie Gods Mercy, then others; but if you are in this number, have a care of growing careless in your examination, or of presuming on your own Innocence: for if we say, or think, we have <note place="margin">Joh. 1.</note> no sin, we miserably deceive our selves. O <hi>Phil.</hi> the best of men, God knows, have very much evil in them to detest, and bewail, and have infinite need of a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, and therefore let him that standeth, take heed <note place="margin">Cor. 10 <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

supplies of Gods grace, for perhaps the Devil defers his tempting you, till you are grown up, and become your own Master, and have not that tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of offending, or that awe of Parents, or Superiors, which you now have.</p>
                  <p>Be not over scrupulous, <hi>Phil.</hi> either to make your self guilty of more sins, then really you are, or to reckon up all your infirmities or dayly failings, or sins of Omission, which would render your Examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion endless, and impossible; but examine your self chiefly, about your wilful sins, or sins of Commission; and know there be many sins, even of Commission, that you may doubt whether you have committed or no, many that you have quite forgot; but be not disheartned at it, for Holy <hi>David</hi> hath taught you, <note place="margin">Psal. 19. 12.</note> that a general Confession for such sins is enough, when he prays to God, to cleanse him from his secret faults.</p>
                  <p>That you may gain a true sense of your sins, by your examination, Labour to imprint in your mind, awsul apprehensions of the day of Judgment, and of God the great Judge, in whose presence you now are, and to raise such apprehensions, Dwell a while, on such Meditations as these.</p>

               <p>HAve a great care, good <hi>Phil.</hi> that you make not any of the Rules here given you, a pretence to neglect the Orders, and duties of the place you live in, or of the School, for that were Idleness rather than devotion.</p>
               <p>When you fix on a day to examine your Soul, or to confess your sins in, Believe me <hi>Phil.</hi> nothing will more enforce your Prayers and Repentance, than if they are accompanied with Fasting and Alms, as you may see in the example of <hi>Cornelius,</hi> whose Prayers, <note place="margin">Acts 10.</note> and Fasting, and Alms all joyned together were so acceptable to God, as made Him send first an Angel from Heaven, and after the Angel, an Apostle, and after the Apostle, the Holy Ghost, to confirm, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten Him.</p>
               <p>But take notice <hi>Phil.</hi> that all the Fasting I advise you to, is only on some Fasting-day, on some one <hi>Friday,</hi> or <hi>Saturday,</hi> when your Commons are less than on other days, to Content your self with your
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:50668:32"/>
bare allowance, and withal, to lay aside some small matter according to your stock, for the Poor.</p>
               <p>But beware, you do not your duty, only to be seen, and approved of by Others, for this were Hypocrisie, and take lieed your performances, do not puff you up, with a vain conceit of your Holiness, and that you are better than your fellows, for this were abominable Pride, and alas! when you have done the best you can, you fall infinitely short of your duty, and 'tis Gods mere Mercy, not any the least worth in you, makes your service any way acceptable, to Him.</p>
               <p>When you have once throughly examined your self, Good <hi>Phil.</hi> and made a particular Confession of the sins of your whole life, and begged Pardon, there is not the same Absolute Necessity, of such la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borious Examination, at your next communicating, especially if you examine your self carefully every Night, and dayly repent of the evil of the day past, and are not Conscious to your self, of any Great, or Notorious Sins, since your last Confession, for if you are not, the Examination and Confession only of what past since your last Communicating, together with a General Confession of your former sins, and a solemn renewing, of your former acts of Repentance, may serve the turn.</p>
               <p>But if your Conscience Accuses you of any Culpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble neglect in your last Examination, or of any great relapses, or of any wilfull violations, of your last Vows and Resolutions, in those, and the like Cascs, 'tis the surest way, to begin all your Repentance again.</p>
               <p>Remember <hi>Phil.</hi> that though 'tis God that works in you to will and to do of his good pleasure, yet God also commands you, to work out your own salvation your self, and therefore you are to labour for those blessings, and to practise those graces you pray for, so that you are to read your duty in your prayers.</p>
               <p>If you find any particular Sin you are guilty of, or any particular grace which you want, or
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:50668:33"/>
any particular blessing which you are to give thanks for, which is not here mentioned, 'tis easie for you to add it, to your prayers, as occasion requires; in like manner if you meet with any passage, in any prayer, which does not either so directly, or so fully ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press, the sense of your Soul, as you could wish, leave it out.</p>
               <p>If Opportunity, Leisure, and Devotion altogether, do at any time, when you go home, or at times of liberty incline you, to make some present addition to your dayly prayers, or like <hi>Daniel</hi> and Holy <hi>David,</hi>

               <p>Know, good <hi>Phil.</hi> that this is the case of thousands, as well as of your self, the very best of Christians, sigh under the pervcrsness, and impotence of their cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt nature, and even the Just man, falls seven times a day, through sins of Ignorance, or Infirmity, or sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den surreption, or inadvertency, or the like; though it is true, he riseth again by an Habitual repentance, and therefore be not discouraged, but dayly beg par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, for your daily failings.</p>
               <p>To ease you in such indispositions, or when you are also streightned in time, or diverted by any Unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able avocations, I advise you to shorten your pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and for the longer Morning and Evening prayer, say the shorter; and as for the other parts of Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, throughout this whole Manual, they are cut into so many breaks and divisions, on purpose, that you may lengthen or shorten your prayers, as may best comply with your Occasions, and Infirmities; Onely let me warn you seriously, that under colour of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulging your infirmities, you dò not indulge your sloth.</p>
               <p>Be not then afflicted, good <hi>Phil.</hi> if you cannot come up exactly, to the Rules here given you. Believe me, it was never imagined you would; it was onely hoped that you would endeavour it; and know that it is a great errour of many devout souls, to think all they do signifies nothing, because they fall short of the Rules laid down, in their Books of Devotion; lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle considering, that 'tis Sincerity God requires of us <note place="margin">2 Cor. 8. 12.</note> and not perfection; for if there be a willing mind in us, it is accepted, according to that which a man hath, and not according to that a man hath not; so that your Infirmities ought to humble, but not to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage you.</p>
               <p>For instance, Suppose you should not be able, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:50668:34"/>
all your endeavours, and prayers, to shed any, or but few tears for your sins, Be not too much cast down at it, for to be troubled for want of tears, is one sign of godly sorrow; and 'tis certain, though tears are very desirable, yet they are not always signs of true Repentance, for Hypocrites may shed them, and there may be true godly sorrow without them; and perhaps God will at last give them to you, when his wisdom sees your Heart, in a fit temper for them.</p>
               <p>Whensoever then you are troubled, with an affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting sense of your infirmities, and for your many fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, I advise you to say this Prayer following, and to rest satisfied that He that died for you, will both hear, and accept, and succour you.</p>
