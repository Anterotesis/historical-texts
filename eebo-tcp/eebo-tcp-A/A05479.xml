            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A CHRISTIAN EXHORTATION to Innocent <hi>Anger.</hi>
            </head>
            <head type="sub">The first Sermon.</head>
            <epigraph>
               <bibl>EPHES. Chap. 4. Vers. 26.</bibl>
               <q>Be angry, but sinne not: Let not the Sunne goe downe vpon your wrath.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hereas all our Passions haue their roote in the minde, and cannot be moued thence: nay, whereas they haue their right vses, so that without them there must needes ensue a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall vacuity of <hi>Sense,</hi> and dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse in the heart: the Apostle first allowing that which is naturall in our affections, permitteth anger: secondly, he forbiddeth that which is contrary to Nature, <hi>Sinne not:</hi> thirdly, if wee haue sinned, hee willeth vs to shake it off quickely: <hi>Let not the Sunne goe downe vpon your wrath.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:1702:5"/>
To vs it seemeth strange, that the Apostle should say, <hi>Be angry, and sinne not.</hi> For wee know not what to say of Anger, but either that it is an hot appetite of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge, or a seething of the bloud about the heart, or a short madnesse, or some such like affection. But if we marke the scope of the Apostle well: He doth not in saying, <hi>Be angry,</hi> permit, but command some an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</p>
            <p>Why the Apostle doth not forbid Anger, we haue this reason; because the passions of our mindes are <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, of themselues indifferent, neither good nor euill. Our Anger then, as it respecteth her end, is good or euill: For there is a time when it is a fault to be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry: and there is a time when it is a fault not to be angry. There is lawfull vse of Anger, as of Loue, of Hatred, and of Sorrow: For there is a godly Loue, a godly Hatred, a godly Sorrow, a godly Anger; aswel, although not as often, as the contrary.</p>
            <p>Neither doe I speake of this passion, as it is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, a first motion, without assent, as in the very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy of her cause. For I doubt not but that all the affections of man, are as man is, conceiued in sinne: yet so, that by originall sinne, the reasonable parts, &amp; those faculties which moue to Anger, are hurt. But that part in which Concupiscence moueth, is infected with taint of sinne. Here I speake of a deliberate An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, confirmed by reason and act of our will, with which we may as well please God, as with our Almes or Prayers, or any other worke of godlinesse.</p>
            <p>Now although the same sinne which hath blemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed our vnderstanding, &amp; defaced our purest minde, hath made much more deformed and vgly those af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections which sit beneath the Will, and being but her sollicitors, haue their place in that part which is more subiect to Concupiscence: yet hath not sinne pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uayled
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:1702:5"/>
to destroy the nature and substance of them. Now if in their Nature they be not abolished, much lesse in their right Vse. The Philosopher said well of Anger, that it is the whet-stone to Fortitude. <hi>Basill,</hi> calleth it a sinew or tendon of the soule, giuing it cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and constancy: and that which is remisse and tender, hardening, as with yron and steele, to pierce and goe through her businesse. To be angry saith S. <hi>Hierome</hi> is the part of a man: and were not Anger, by <note place="margin">Hom <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

            <p>The Stoicks hould a vacuity of affections, and condemne them all as vnlawsull: why? because they draw vs to disorder and outrage: but this is not the nature of our affections, but the affection of our cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt nature. Christ himselfe was not without affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: he was angry when he cast the <note n="a" place="margin">Mat. 21. <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

            <p>It cannot then be denied but that Anger is vpon iust causes to be permitted. Now let vs see in regard whereof it may be commanded.</p>
            <p>There is a time when Gods honour is defaced, and then be angry, through iust zeale, as <hi>Phinehas</hi>

               <hi>Brethren, if any man be ouer taken with a fault, you which are spiritual</hi>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:1702:6"/>
               <hi>instruct such an one, with the spirit of gentlenesse, conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring thy selfe, least thou also be tainted.</hi> First the ve, ry in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinuation were enough to perswadevs, seeing we are al brethren. Secondly, there is no difference betweene them and vs, but in time: they may preuent vs in sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, we shall follow them. Thirdly, because flesh and blood is insolent, the Apostle maketh a distinct choyse of the persons exhorted: you that are spirituall, you which haue your hearts softned with the vnction of the holy Ghost. Fourthly, the medicine is set downe, we must instruct him: shew him the nature and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of his fault, and how to amend it. Fiftly, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredience to the medicine is prescribed, with the spirit of meeknesse. Sixtly, we are bound to it by equality of nature, considering thy selfe. Seauenthly, it is worth the noting, that whereas before hee sayd in the plurall number brethren, you: now by a kinde of selecisme he maketh it euery mans case: considering thy selfe, least thou also be tainted. But to goe forward, there is a third kinde of lawfull anger: when wee must be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry with our selues for sinnes and trespasses by vs committed: but yet in this kinde of anger let vs not sinne, that is, fall into dispaire: for there is mercy with God albeit we haue sinned. So the first anger, in which we are moued against our brother, commeth from a Godly zeale, the second, when we rebuke our brother for his amendment, commeth from our loue to God: and the third, when we are angry and displeased with our selues, for our sinnes, is our repentance before God. We which haue suffred our affections to stoope downe to sinne, and haue suffered our selues to be caried and misled by them; knowing now that there is necessary vse of them to good, shall we not turne them away from actions of vniustice, and restore them to the honour of God, and the good of our selues, and
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:1702:6"/>
of our neighbour? We which haue beene so often an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry and sinned, is it not now time to learne to be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry and not sinne? How happy shall we be, if wee can fence and saue our selues with that sword, with which we haue wounded so many of our brethren? How hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py shall we then be when we haue wonne those pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbations from the Diuell, which hang downe so low, and easie for sinne, and by which sinne taking hold, doth clime vp higher into our will and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing! I conclude then with Saint <hi>Basile, Ser: de Ira, If you will be angry with out sinning, and shew forth the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full vse of this affection; know that one is allured to sinne, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other enclineth and allureth him: conuert your anger against the latter of these two; a murtherer of his brethren, a father of lies: maligne not him that is ensnared &amp; entrapped: Be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry where is a fault which may beare anger, which cannot be a priuate displeasure, but a fáult openly tending to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanation of Gods feareful name, pollution of his Sacraments, and seruice: Publique, scandalous, incorrigible and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sufferable faults, whereby his Christ is dishonoured, his good spirit of grace despighted, and the whole congregation and family, that is in heauen and earth, wounded and blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. Be angry with those which are angry with God vpon e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery light occasion, for euery crosse, wherewith they are tryed, ready to goe backe and to walke no longer with him: or if their mouthes be not filled with laughter and pleasure, to their hearts desire, and their besties with Garlicke and flesh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pots, as in the daies of darkenesse, breake forth into termes of highest vndutifulnesse, saying:</hi> 
               <note n="i" place="margin">Mat. 3. 14.</note> What profit is there in seruing God? <hi>Be angry with those that are angry with the Prophets for prophesying right things vnto them: Be angry with the Prophets if they seeke their ease, if they preach Lies, if they preach not the Word: Be angry with the Citty if it repent not at the preaching of the Prophets, but when they haue pronounced the iudgments of God take them but for</hi>

               <hi>casteth firebrands and arrowes and mortall things, and saith,</hi> am I not in iest? <hi>Be angry with dogges, which returne to their vomit, though they beene purged seauen times, and in a word to knit vp all; Be angry with your sinnes, the diuell, lies, vanities, your selues.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now come we to the prohibition which is the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond part: but sinne not. Heere Saint <hi>Paul</hi> warneth vs of a pit, into which our anger may fall; namely sinne: A pit more daungerous then that into which <note n="*" place="margin">Gen. 37. 22.</note> 
               <hi>Ioseph</hi> was throwne, by his brethren: for many fall into this pit, which neuer come foorth againe, and this the more carefully we ought to shunne, how much the more our nature vergeth downewards, and our passions haue their selfe aptnesse and pronesse to that which is euill. There is in vs almost an insensible difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene anger and sinne; and Saint <hi>Paul</hi> cannot name the one, but hee must aduise to cause vs shunne the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: so secretly, so subtily, that which is euill is mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to that which is naturall: the motions of our minds were ordained to this end, that they should obey rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, but they refuse to obey God.</p>
            <p>But the sinne of anger, is so far extended, and lyeth so many waies, that it may seeme a matter of great hardnesse to expresse how diuersly we fall into it: It shall suffice for our present purpose to make some briefe obseruations hereof, and so to come to our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion.</p>
            <p>First, Anger, bringeth in sinne, by rashnesse: for what easier way is there to fall, then by omitting counsaile? and what greater enimie to counsaile, then wrath? by which, when we haue but a little distasted, like mouthes of men diseased, we relish not of sweet and wholesome counsailes, but by heate and distemperature of mind, fall into sodaine and violent passions, which bring
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:1702:7"/>
with them shame and confusion: and for this cause <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi> when he was angry at his seruant, refused to beate him: saying, <hi>He would first whip his anger.</hi> This was <note n="l" place="margin">Gen. 39.</note> 
               <hi>Potiphers</hi> fault, for when his wrath was kindled by a false suggestion, he punished <hi>Ioseph</hi> with impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonment, albeit his anger tooke occasion from a lie, to wrong the innocent. I, this was <hi>Dauids</hi> fault, when he gaue too hasty credit to false <note n="m" place="margin">2 Sam. 16. 4.</note> 
               <hi>Ziba</hi> his accusation, and he which was otherwise like an <note n="n" place="margin">2 Sam. 14. 20.</note> Angell of God, was made now beneath the condition of a reasonable man. This, effecteth anger in the wisest men, euen pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling out their eyes of reason and vnderstanding, and making them blind-fold, casteth them headlong into actions of injustice.</p>
            <p>But this is the least euill of Anger, in which wee seeme to haue done most modestly, when wee haue done but rashly: For this is worse, that after it hath ouerthrowne counsell in vs, it causeth vs to aske counsell of her, which is as much, as leauing to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult with men, we should goe to Schoole with beasts: and as <note n="o" place="margin">1 Sam. 28.</note> 
               <hi>Saul,</hi> hauing forsaken God, consult with the Diuell: like <hi>Iuno</hi> in <hi>Virgil.</hi>

            </l>
            <l>If I cannot moue Heauen, I will rake Hell.</l>
            <p>For when our disordred affection hath this priority in vs, the first thing on which it taketh hold, is Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge. Of which I will not say, that we offend, when eyther wee attempt it against him which hath not deserued it, or prosecute it further than merit, or not holding a lawfull course: For to say truth, wee offend when we meddle with it at all: <note n="p" place="margin">Rom. 12. 24.</note> 
               <hi>For vengeance is mine, saith the Lord.</hi> What doe we then by seeking ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance, but take the Sword out of Gods hand, into our owne? What doe we by eagerly pursuing others;
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:1702:8"/>
but compell God to call our owne sinnes to minde; and wee which euen where bankes are lowe, would bring earth and mull to bay the floud, doe make the bankes and breaches of our poore brethren greater than they were; and instead of binding vp that which was bruised, rubbe one anothers sores, and adde af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction to the afflicted. It is not (to say truth) the fault of our poore brethren wee hate in this iniust fury, but our brother: else why are wee more offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded at his Moate, than at our beame? It is not his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation we seeke, but his subuersion: otherwise had wee not shewen heate and reuenge, but meeknesse and pitty, considering thy selfe. Such a construction a godly Father made of his brothers fault: <hi>Ille hodie, ego or as: He hath fallen this day, I may fall tomorrow.</hi> For if we be rightly displeased at faults, we shall finde small leasure and time to spare, from chastising our owne: yea all our wrath and indignation is too little to beate downe our owne sinnes. And the life of euery one of vs, hath matter enough of hatred and reuenge, to waste and consume, I will not say the passions of our owne minde in repining and grieuing; but if wee might be vvrathfull and hatefull to our selues, with all the Angers, and mindes of all other men.</p>
            <p>And what doe I speake of vnlawful fury, which ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uanceth it selfe against the weakenesse and trespasse of other men, when it spareth not their vertues? They are our enemies, because they are good, because they excell vs in righteousnesse. Wee hate them for ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, for truths sake: there is no hony more svveet than to prey vpon the righteous man: we search for priuy slanders, &amp; digge the filth out of lewd tongues to cast it vpon them: and thinke wee haue made rich gaine of our spite, when wee haue made our selues most vile and wicked, to make them seeme so. And
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:1702:8"/>
that we may the better discouer, what mischiefe, what insatiable repine is in Anger, there is nothing more apparent, that our wrath is neuer more hote, more outragious, more deadly and extreame, then when it opposeth it selfe to truth and righteousnesse: In other causes it may be mittigated, our differences with e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill and wicked men draw to their reconciliation and truce. <note n="a" place="margin">Luke 23. 5.</note> 
               <hi>Herod</hi> and <hi>Pilate</hi> can be made friends, but CHRIST and <hi>Pilate</hi> neuer. When wee are incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed against the good, wee will haue no end but their end. We neuer leaue pursuing till wee cry, <hi>Tolle, tolle, crucifige,</hi> 
               <note n="b" place="margin">Luke 2<gap reason="illegible" extent="1+ letters">

               <hi>Away with him, Crucifie him.</hi> If any aske what euill hath hee done? We know our hatred is, because he did no euill. Who euer more suffered of the blinde rage and bitter fury of men, than Iesus Christ the Son of God, that milde Lambe without spot of sinne? And after him what direr tempest of persecution hath the raging world stirred against any, then his holy Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles and Martirs, which came neerest to him in holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse <gap reason="illegible" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>of life. Yet they which thus rage at the iust, are deceiued; for what doe they effect heereby, but to make good men more innocent, and themselues more wicked?</p>
            <p>To this it seemeth a small matter, that Anger bree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth grieuance and disturbance in our common life and manners. <hi>Anger resteth in the</hi>

               <hi>bosome of a foole:</hi> It resteth in our bosomes, and hath the ouer-sight of our actions, and the rule and disposition of our life: and it hath rested so long, that now the loue of <hi>Christ</hi> speaketh coldly out of our hearts: hee that speaketh to vs from heauen; <note n="d" place="margin">Math. 5. 44.</note> 
               <hi>Loue your enemies, pray for them that persecute you,</hi> seemeth not onely to speake coldly, but vainely and ridiculously: Wee hate our friends, and persecute them which pray for vs. The least winde and blast of displeasure, ouerthroweth all our god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse.
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:1702:9"/>
When we should communicate with IESVS CHRIST, wee stay at home to communicate with Anger and bitternesse: it is more sweet to vs to striue with our neighbour, than to taste of remission of our sinnes, and to be washed in the bloud of Iesus Christ. If wee offend any, or are offended, wee thinke wee haue sufficient reason to deny our saluation, and to throw downe ourselues from heauen: to excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate our selues wilfully from the body &amp; bloud of Christ. Hence it commeth that it is growne familiar with our life and manners, vpon the least word of disgrace, to seeke the life of our brother. We take our weapons in hand, and like <hi>Caines,</hi> we leade one another into the field; and we lift vp our hand against the face of God in our brother, to destroy it; little consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that we doe not so onely, but we fight against our owne soule; we fight against heauen, against God.</p>
            <p>Thus you see that Anger is not onely in vs turned to sinne, but how strongly it bindes all sinnes together. It beginneth with troubling our bloud and bodily sense, but it endeth with extinction of grace, and slay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the soule. At the first entry and step we tremble, as if our heart were shaken to the very foundation and bottome of life: but it ceaseth not till it hath ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected a meere stupiditie and deadnesse in all our rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable parts. If we haue not yet learned sufficiently to detest this sinne; let vs draw to our selues the pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture of a man inraged. Looke you vpon his feete: they are not now the feete of a man, but <note n="a" place="margin">Rom. 3. 15.</note> the feete of a Tyger, swift to shed bloud.

What should we now say, if that deformity might be seene which lurkes within? Hence come slaunders, deare brethren: hence blasphemies, cursing, swearing, lying, fightings, warres, bloudshed; euen from wrath, the seminary of all mischiefe: what Beare hauing broken the Grates, is more sauage or outragious, then Anger hauing once gotten out of the warde and custody of Reason? We grieue not for the euill we haue done: but for that we could not doe: we will sooner repent what wee pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised out of the aduice of Loue, than what wee haue menaced in our fury. O wretches! if we doe not yet conceiue what wrong we doe to others, yet let vs pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty our selues. Our anger hurteth vs before it can hurt our brother. What then gainest thou, if thy ovvne minde being darkened, reason cast behinde, thy vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding led captiue, in wracke of thy soule, and in confusion of thy selfe, thy fury hath preuayled to hurt thy brother?

Thou fightest against him with that svvord; the very poynt whereof thou turnest to thine ovvne heart. Thou woundest his fame: thou slayest thine ovvne soule. <hi>Socrates</hi> was wont to say when he saw a drunken man; <hi>Num ego talis? Am I such a one?</hi> Let vs consider, whether we be such as I haue said: let vs see whether we haue of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended God more by not repenting the euill, then by committing it: whether wee haue cursed them whom we should haue blessed: vvhether vvee haue smitten them vvhom vve should haue defended: if wee haue turned our compassions into cruelties, and our loues into hatreds. Let vs consider if wee haue rashly or despitefully slaundered our brethren, and giuen the reines to sinne, and made our members the vveapons of wrath and reuenge: and say; Are we such? Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse the sinne of Anger should be so much the more detested of vs, hovv much the more it fighteth against Loue and Charity, the very Badges and Recognisan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of our calling.

            <p>First we shall avoyde the familiarity of sinne, then which nothing is more daungerous; and shunne those occasions by which sinne insinuating it selfe into vs, preuaileth at last to seeme sweet and pleasing, so that it should neuer possibly appeare to vs, but in her blacke shape and abhorred nature: for the custome and fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship with sinne, lendeth that ougly monster op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, to dissemble and shrowd it selfe vnder the couering of nature. Be the familiarity of sinne as farre from the children of God as light from darknesse: let rancor and malice and fury rest in the natures of fierce and sauage beasts, whose outward formes and aspects doe threaten violence and cruelty. If we iustly auoyde the company of sinners, how much more the sinne it selfe? How far should we be from harbouring dissenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and strife in vs, which if we follow the rule of the Apostle, <hi>must not be</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">Eph. 5. 3.</note> 
               <hi>named in vs.</hi> The wise men of Troy sitting in counsaile in the gate, when <hi>Helena,</hi> for whom they sustained so long warres, passed by; said: It may be suffered that the Troyans should beare long troubles, for such a peerelesse Lady, which for Beauty and Linements of her Face is to be compared to the Goddesses of immortall state: But though she be thus comparelesse, let her goe: Let her not stay to our wrack and the woe of our children. His words are <gap reason="foreign">

Did they for feare of euill, depart from an excellent beauty, and a face of pleasure; and shall we not let goe wrath and reuenge, in which is nothing which may allurevs but Gall and Bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and Hellish foulenesse and Deformity?</p>
            <p>The second benefit we haue hence, is that we get ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage ouer sinne, while sinne is young, and in her Infancy; so we giue the enemie, by timely resisting those wounds he would haue giuen vs. The foolish Husbandman protracted the Tilling of his ground, expecting <note n="b" place="margin">

               <hi>Dum defluat amnis;</hi> whiles the Riuer should runne away. More foolishly doe we defer the remedy of sinne, till the Floud of Anger runne all ouer vs. In all other fights, <hi>Prima coitio est acerrima:</hi> the first in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter is sharpest: but in our Buckling with the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell, the first encounter is the easiest: therefore the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle <note n="c" place="margin">Horat.</note> saith, <hi>resist the Diuell, and he will flie from</hi> 
               <note place="margin">d Iam. 4. 7.</note> 
               <hi>you:</hi> for the old Serpent hauing his head bruised and crushed, cannot now so easily thrust in his mortall Sting, vnlesse we dally with him, and lay our selues open. Yet speake I not this to maitaine security, as if in the first encounter we ought not to gather all our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and maine power to beat downe Satan, for too strong is sinne when it is at her weakest, and there is no security of an enemie in the day time: This may onely serue to shew our folly, which defer the time of strength, to resist our enimie when we are weaker: and lend our hand to him which would leade vs from the way of light into darkenesse, to kill vs there.</p>
            <p>The third benefit is, we shall keepe sin from being extreamly sinfull, which they doe not which harbour the desire of Reuenge so long in the Vessels of their hearts, till at last it sowre and turne all to Bitternesse. For there is no difference betweene Anger and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, but as in Wine and Vineger. Anger is a short Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:1702:12"/>
and Malice a long Anger. Hence we are plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged from the low waters of sinne, into the Deepe, and from one deepe into another: To resist our cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring; to hate the Phisitian; to iustifie our Wrath: As if we <note n="c" place="margin">I<gap reason="illegible" extent="1+ letters">

desires to life, are extinguished: We should not suffer Reason and Vnderstanding, the burning lights of our soule, to be thus darkned and fouly eclipsed: we should not suffer IESVS CHRIST the Sonne of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse to set vpon our wrath, till we had rising by him to Heauens Glory and to peace, and life, and glory, for euer.</p>

The place of offering <hi>Izhak;</hi> whether generall, as the land of

The length and durance of the triall, three daies, verse, 4. But these circumstances will better be moued with their maine parts together, which are three: First, the Triall it selfe, God proued <hi>Abraham.</hi> Secondly, his Faith, in answering the tentation: and thirdly, his Obedience, in avoyding it, from the fourth verse, to the twelfth.</p>
            <p>Now, whereas all tentations may be reduced to two kindes; for either we are tempted in things we loue, or in things we feare: For as we must loue nothing, aboue God, so we must feare nothing beyond him: our Sauiour CHRIST, arming vs against all temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, maketh a briefe recitall of both kindes; <note n="a" place="margin">Mat, 10. 3<gap reason="illegible" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> 
               <hi>He that loueth Father or Mother; Sonne or Daughter, more then me, is not worthy of me:</hi> Here is mention made of things we loue. And in the next verse, <hi>he that taketh not vp his Crosse and followeth after me, is not worthy of me.</hi> Here is mention made of things we feare. Now temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations exemplified to vs, in these two kinds, do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine vnder them all sorts else whatsoeuer; For as the loue of the Father to the Sonne, and the Sonne to the Father, is of all earthly loues the greatest: And if to God we are bound to resigne the greatest loue, much more all lesser loues: so the death of the Crosse is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all other kinds of death, Cruell, Fearefull, and Bitter. And if we stand bound in a couenant with God, to vndertake that death for him, which is so ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominious and terrible to Nature; how can we be excused, if euils of lesse weight and consequence doe driue vs from him? Doubtlesse such trials are necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for vs, that as the loue of God, bearing soueraignty in our hearts, should make all the loues and delights of our life sweet: so the feare of God in vs, exceeding
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:1702:14"/>
all other feares, should make all the euills of this World to seeme lesse bitter.</p>
            <p>Now as touching our purpose; We see <hi>Abraham,</hi> which had beene sufficiently tryed before, in bearing his Crosse, now put to the highest triall of all: Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he can sustaine to sacrifice his Sonne. He had pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed a long Pilgrimage before these things, through many banishments, and difficulties, to fourescore yeares of Age: he held his troubled life in Care in E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uils, in Danger, in Bitternes, in Feare; He <note n="a" place="margin">Gen. 12. 10. Gen. 20. 1.</note> was twise dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to depart the land, to which he was called by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise; and for necessity of Famine, to flie to Aegypt: his deere Wife was <note n="b" place="margin">Gen. 12. 15. Gen. 20. 2.</note> twise plucked out of his bosome. He warred with foure <note n="c" place="margin">Gen. 14.</note> Kings, not without great danger of his life: his Wife continued <note n="d" place="margin">Gen. 16. 1.</note> barraine, on whose issue the Hope of his life attended. When he had a Sonne by <hi>Hagar;</hi> he is driuen to abandon him. Now <hi>Isack</hi> 
               <note n="e" place="margin">Gen. 21. 12.</note> is Borne, he hath the Promise sealed in his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some, he hath quiet and rest in his old age. But see, God thundreth from Heauen, and rowseth <hi>Abraham</hi> out of the onely ioy and content of his life: <hi>Abraham, take now thy only Sonne</hi> Izack <hi>whom thou louest.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let <hi>Abraham</hi> teach vs what our life is. He which bore the greatest loue to God, what did hee but su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staine the greatest Triall? Hee which held, as a great Captaine in the hoste of God, the buckler of Faith before vs all; how notably doth hee shew the danger of so many sharpe encounters, by so many dints of temptation, and the impression of so many fiery darts of the Diuell? Now, as through Faith he ouercame in all, so by him wee are taught, that our life is nothing else but a certaine order and ranke of temptations; where, when one endeth, another beginneth: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Wise man saith, <note n="f" place="margin">Ecclesiast. 2. 1</note> 
               <hi>My sonne, when thou wilt come into the seruice of God, stand fast in righteousnesse and</hi>

               <hi>feare, and prepare thy soule to temptations.</hi> But let vs not feare those euills which neuer linne mouing and tumbling vs, vntill they haue set vs vpon the Rocke, which is higher than they: Let vs not feare that fire which can burne nothing but our drosse: Let vs not feare those wounds which can let forth nothing but our corruptions: but let vs brandish the sword of the Spirit against all spirits; against the spirit of the flesh, which seeketh sweet things; against the spirit of the world which coueteth vaine things; and against the lying <note n="g" place="margin">Iohn 8. 44.</note> spirit, which was a murtherer from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning. <hi>The iust shall liue by faith.</hi>

            <p>But come we to the temptation it selfe; where find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it said, that God proued <hi>Abraham;</hi> we learne that God hath his manner of tempting and prouing vs; but such as is for our good, and the exercise of our faith, whose end is no other than to bring forth the light of good workes, and a more sweet sauour of our life. Neither is that of Saint <hi>Iames</hi> repugnant, which saith <note n="k" place="margin">Iames 1. 13.</note> 
               <hi>No man is tempted of God, but of his owne concupiscence:</hi> For his purpose is onely to refute their damned blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:1702:15"/>
which to acquite themselues, would make God the Author of their sinne: therefore Saint <hi>Iames</hi> telleth vs, that we must ascribe the causes of sinne to our owne concupiscence: For the roote of them is from our owne heart. For albeit Satan instill his poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and kindle with his bellowes, a fire of euill de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires in vs: yet it is our owne flesh that is first mouer, and our owne will which we obey. For as corru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on could not by the heate of the ayre ambient enter into our bodies, if our bodies did not consist of such a nature, as hath in her selfe the causes of corruption; No more could sinne which is a generall rot and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of the soule, enter into vs through the allure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or prouocation of outward things, if our soules had not first, of themselues, receiued that inward hurt, by which their desire is made subiect to sinne: as the womans desire was made subiect to the <note n="b" place="margin">Genes. 3. 16.</note> husband; and as the Philosophers say, the Matter to the Forme. Now the forme of this temptation <hi>Moses</hi> setteth down in the highest sort; whereas God doth seeme to shake the faith of his word in the heart of his holy seruant, by a contrary engine of the same word. To this, God citeth <hi>Abraham</hi> by name twice, to obedience: that hee might haue no doubt, who is the Author of the temptation. Had he not beene certainely perswaded, that it was the voyce, the word of God, with which hee stood charged to offer his sonne <hi>Izak,</hi> hee might most easily auoyde any other temptation, or what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer Art or subtilty the Diuell might haue vsed to batter his faith. Now hauing no other standing but in the Word, no other sword to fight against distrust, he seemeth to be entrapped in his standing; and with the same Sword himselfe is wounded, with which hee should haue hurt the enemy. For (beloued brethren) if this Sword being but taken from vs, we must needs
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:1702:15"/>
fall, what shall wee doe when God seemeth to strike at vs with the edge thereof? Now this was <hi>Abrahams</hi> case.</p>
            <p>Let vs then heare the Word speake; <hi>Take thy sonne Izhak whom thou louest, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We see with what griefe and resisting, we endure the searching or cutting of our naturall affections, though sinfull: how then must it grieue him to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergoe the rasing out of tender pitty, of fatherly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion, which not onely were planted by Nature in his heart, but were fed and cherished by Gods owne word? <note n="c" place="margin">Exod. 4. 25.</note> If <hi>Zipporah</hi> could say to <hi>Moses, thou art a bloudy husband,</hi> for causing her to circumcise her son; might not <hi>Abraham,</hi> vrged by commandement to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice his sonne, say, <hi>This is a bloudy word?</hi> If the child had beene commaunded to haue attempted some hard thing against the father, the like difficulty of execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion had not ensued. For albeit the commandement biddeth the sonne to <note n="d" place="margin">Exod. 20.</note> 
               <hi>Honour his father,</hi> whereas no word of command vrgeth the father to honour the sonne: This is done to no other end, but to require the loue of children to their parents, because in them it is most wanting. There neede no commandement to enioyne Loue to descend, which it cannot but doe; but to ascend, which it doth not so easily. And as this is true in our earthly parents, so is it in God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of vs all. Gods loue, Gods righteousnesse doth daily descend from heauen to vs: Doth our loue, our righteousnesse so ascend to him? Hence is it that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit the Scripture yeeld no commandement for the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to loue the sonne, yet the Scripture taketh the fathers part, in preferring the loue of the parents be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the childrens loue, whereas God himselfe exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plifieth his loue to vs, in the loue of a father, <note n="e" place="margin">Psal. 1. 1<gap reason="illegible" extent="1+ letters">

               <hi>compassion on them that feare him.</hi> How then shall <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> answere this word? May he not object: My God and my Lord, is not the loue and pitty I beare to the childe of my flesh, by thine owne finger written in mine heart? hast not thou thy selfe shed this ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernesse in my bowels? Doe not Birds and Beasts, and all sauage and cruell creatures, cherish and nourish their young; and must I, which am a father, slay my sonne? Thus you see how forcibly this heauy word inuadeth <hi>Abrahams</hi> soule, and vrgeth him beyond all possibilitie of humane power, to destroy Pitty, which is naturall; and which is hardest, to murther Loue, which for her safety was fled into the in-most Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary of his heart. Now this may seeme not a little to moue him, that God seemes to <gap reason="illegible" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>ocke him: For hee calleth him <hi>Abraham,</hi> which is, <hi>a</hi>

            <p>Had not the word sounded hard in the eares of flesh and bloud, which should haue required of a man the sacrifice of a man, or a strangers, or a seruants life? for when in sacrifice they shed the bloud of Beasts, they did it not without pitty and compassion, which they signified when they laid their hands vpon the <note n="b" place="margin">Exod. 29. 15.</note> head of the Beast, shewing that the poore Beast was inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, and that for them it was slaine.

               <hi>What profit is there in seruing God?</hi> Doe not the wicked flourish? Doe not their sonnes and daughters liue and prosper? Hast thou laid any such burthen vpon them which blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme thy Name? But see, <hi>Abraham</hi> for Gods loue, spareth not his onely sonne: but the Triall resteth not thus, but rankleth and festreth further. <hi>Abraham</hi> must sacrifice his onely sonne, which he loueth. Thus Gods word swalloweth vp all our deerenesse: Hee will haue vs surrender, not onely the things which we loue, but our loue it selfe, to the end we may end all deerenesse in him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Abraham</hi> had many causes to loue this childe: first, because he was the sonne of his <note n="l" place="margin">Genes. 21. 2.</note> wife, not of the Bond-woman: Secondly, for that hee was borne in his age, and in the age of his wife, when her wombe had no more nature or power to quicken than the Graue; so beyond hope, so by miracle, he receiued him. How then should hee not loue him naturally, whom he receiued miraculously? Thirdly, wee see, the older we grow to the end of our life, our affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are doubled to our children: and of what cause I know not; but it is most euident, that when we are
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:1702:17"/>
aged, our loues are inclined to such as wee affect, as if they went forth of vs into them; so they carry vs with extreamenesse of fondnesse and doting. Like those, which hauing slidden downe from an higher place, the further they slide, are carried with such vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence &amp; force, that they cannot recouer then selues a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine: As these were sufficient causes of loue; first, that hee was the Sonne of his Wife: secondly, of his old age: thirdly, borne by Myracle: so fourthly, hee is further grieued with his losse, because hee was so long <note n="m" place="margin">Genes. 15. 3.</note> expected and desired. So that hee which had beene almost tyred with expectation of that, in regard whereof all earthly things might seeme vile vnto him: being now seazed of his joy, must cast it off, with greater griefe and bitternesse than euer with comfort he receiued it: so that now all the promises and fauors of God, are turned to gall and wormewood; and better had it beene for him neuer to haue receiued a sonne, than with such heauinesse to forsake him. To these we may adde a fift circumstance, contayning in it a further cause of Loue; namely, the behauiour and disposition, and meeknesse, and obedience of <hi>Izhak:</hi> his innocence, and many delights of duty, and quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which Nature is most content and easie to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace; yet all these <hi>Abraham</hi> putteth away for God: Neither doth a sixt difficulty hinder him, namely, that his loue was to his sonne so much the more, as <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> himselfe was just and righteous; and being so, could see no reason to be the Executioner of his inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Childe, but that hee gaue ouer himselfe to the Commandement, and suffered GOD to dispute for him.</p>
            <p>But beyond all these, hee hath a further triall and combate with the promise it selfe. For hee must de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend vpon the promise, and yet act that which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:1702:17"/>
to it; hee must plant all hope of future comfort vpon <hi>Izhak,</hi> and yet must kill him: For all the graces offered by God to <hi>Abraham,</hi> were included in this Warrant; <hi>In</hi> 
               <note n="n" place="margin">Gen. 21. 12.</note> 
               <hi>Izhak shall thy seede he called:</hi> so that <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> must now offer, not onely his owne hope, but the hope of all the world. You wil demand then; How could his faith cause him to offer his sonne, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarying that same promise, vpon which it was built? Saint <hi>Paul</hi> answereth, saying; that his faith yet relied on the promise, because hee knew, that <hi>God was able to</hi> 
               <note n="o" place="margin">Heb. 11. 19.</note> 
               <hi>raise him from the dead.</hi> Hauing then to doe with God which is omnipotent, hee thus reconcileth the Commandement with the Promise, leauing the issue to the diuine Prouidence, of which himselfe was igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant: this honour doth the truth of God require of vs, to bring all our senses and wits to nothing, to be of it selfe sufficient without meanes, to be aboue all difficulties and lets whatsoeuer. As therefore, when he before expected <hi>Izhak</hi> from the dead womb of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra;</hi> in hope he went beyond hope: so now appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending the same quickening power of God, which was able to inspire the ashes of his dead sonne, he pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth out of the Laborynth and Maze of the temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And albeit God tendering our infirmities, doe not so seuerely racke and examine our faiths: yet it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed him to shew an example thereof in the father of all the faithfull, to bring vs, at the least, to the common triall thereof. For Faith, which is more precious than gold, cannot (without triall) take deepe roote downe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, nor flourish vpward.</p>
            <p>But this triall, touching the Promise, leaues not <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> yet: For, hauing giuen off his own affection to <hi>Izhak,</hi> and departed with fatherly pitty: he must seem to reiect the loue of God, which he beheld in <hi>Izhak,</hi> which was to him as a glasse of life, and the pledge of
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:1702:18"/>
all Gods graces and fauours, and further the very name of <hi>Izhak</hi> must moue him; which is by interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, <hi>Laughter,</hi> and telleth him he hath no ioy left: He then which was giuen only for matter of joy and comfort, being taken away, must needes leaue him to sorrow and griefe of heart.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Eliak</hi> being tyred out with afflictions in the heaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes &amp; anguish of his spirit, cryed out to God; <note n="a" place="margin">1 Reg. 19. 4.</note> 
               <hi>It is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough Lord, take away my soule: what am I better than my Fathers?</hi> Might not <hi>Abraham,</hi> so farre sifted, the triall now boyling in the fornace of his heart, cry; <hi>it is enough Lord, take away the tentation?</hi> But now hauing answered all doubts to God and his conscience, hee must answere the world and the speeches of men. For what will others say? An injust father, a Butcher of his childe: I, his owne wife and houshold seruants will condemne him, and cast his obedience to GOD vpon him, as an action of most vile reproach and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame cruelty. Thus when hee had vanquished the Diuell and Distrust within, hee must answere, feares, and shames, and fight without; and this was (no doubt) no small temptation.</p>
            <p>Yet must <hi>Abraham</hi> farther carry the racke in his heart three dayes iourney; in which, what is he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, but continually sacrificed? He must behold his sonne all this while, whose sight bindeth all his woes together: hee must drinke in Bitternesse with his eyes, which cannot be suffered to depart from their griefe. To which the words of <note n="b" place="margin">Verse 7.</note> 
               <hi>Izhak, My father, heere is wood and fire, but where is the Lambe for sacrifice?</hi> make his wounds bleede afresh; so that now <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> is like <hi>Ionas</hi> in the belly of the Whale; in the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome <note n="c" place="margin">Ionas 2. 3.</note> of the Sea: hauing all Gods mighty waues and surges ouer his head.</p>
            <p>Yet that his triall may want no part of extreame a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gony
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:1702:18"/>
and anguish, the Action it selfe were able to draw out of his eyes, flouds of teares, and to make the sinews of his armes shrinke in the execution, and to make an heart of stone to bleede: For albeit in the former trialls, hee departed not from his obedience, yet it might haue beene, that when hee looked vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the pale face of his onely sonne <hi>Izhak, which he lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved:</hi> and all these circumstances of sorrow and ruth, anew and freshly were presented him, and his one heart must endure all these temptations, now joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned together, like a Wedge, to sunder his soule and spirit: I say, it might haue beene that his resolutions would haue staggered, his pitties and compassions which hee cast out returning againe.

               <hi>bloud and sprinckle it vpon the Altar:</hi> hee must cut him in pieces, and pull out his entralls and wash them, and wash his legges, and put them vpon the other pieces, and his head, and burne them all to cinders: and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this, he must not blinne, hee must shew no face of sorrow.

               <hi>offered his sonne Izhak? Iames</hi> Chap. 2. Verse 21.</p>
            <p>To come then to our second part: Wee see in our father <hi>Abraham</hi> a notable example of obedience. He shutteth his eyes to all things else, and onely openeth them to Gods word. He maketh a way to serue God through all lets, through all fleshly impossibilities: and being in this way, hee trampleth vnder him his owne nature, and beateth a path for Gods word out of his owne heart. Finally, hee regardeth not what men say, nor what his owne thoughts can say; but hauing receiued his mandate, posteth on his journey, suffering Gods wisedome to reason for him, and Gods omnipotent power and prouidence to worke for him. For <hi>Abraham</hi> was now such a man, as might haue hoped for rest in his flesh: hee might haue said: Lord, I haue serued thee these hundred yeares in sufficient trialls of my loue and obedience: now I am old, giue me now immunity, let me be no longer prest. Againe, he had accesse to God and familiarity: he knew God was pittifull, and mercifull, and easie to be intreated; and yet he neuer spake one word for himselfe, nor his sonne <hi>Izhak:</hi> He complayned not of his griefe: he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fired not to haue the burden lessened: but as if he had the feete of an Hinde, runneth three dayes journey, by the way of the commandement; till a new Post from Heauen ouertaketh and stayeth him, and Gods owne mouth comforted him. Thus he which beleeued and obeyed, hath found, to his and our endlesse comfort, that all the trialls, through which it pleaseth God to leade vs, are no other than steps and staires to raise vs higher into his grace and fauour. For the issue of the temptation was to winne a farther obedience from <hi>Abraham,</hi> that God might lift him vp higher, and make his Couenant with him irreuocable, by swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by himselfe. As if God should say: Thou art not
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:1702:19"/>
yet, <hi>Abraham,</hi> so great as I will make thee. I haue purpose to aduaunce thee higher. Thou mightest be contented with this opinion, and forme of obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: but I will ring it further, and make thy name more glorious. Thus <hi>Abraham,</hi> by thinking to glorifie God, hath magnified himselfe, and turned his obedience to God, to his owne honour: What hadst thou lost <hi>Abraham,</hi> if thou hadst not lost <hi>Iz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hak?</hi> how vnmercifull hadst thou beene, if thou hadst beene mercifull? The World had lost an Example; we had lost our lesson; the Faithfull had lost a father, and God a sonne. Wee see now how well it is said of <hi>Samuell; Toobey is better than</hi>

               <hi>Sacrifice.</hi> For <hi>Abrahams</hi> sacrifice God refused, and accepted his obedience: and to his obedience sealeth the Couenant. True, for a wicked man may offer sacrifice, none can obey but the good: He that sacrificeth, offereth the bloud of Bulls and Goates: hee that obeyeth, maketh a sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice <note n="b" place="margin">Psal. 51. 17.</note> of his owne heart: we see Obedience is no dts<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putant, no framer of Excuses. For if the Captaine command the Souldier a piece of seruice: Must hee tell him why? Is it not enough for the Centurion to say to his Seruant, <note n="c" place="margin">Math. 8. 9.</note> 
               <hi>Doe this, and hee doth it?</hi> Must the Subiect obey his Prince in nothing, but when he is of his counsell? But if with men it were so, yet with God it may not so be: of whom it is sufficient for vs to but know that wee are commanded to obey what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer his will and pleasure is. For this reasoning with the Commandement, cast our father <hi>Adam</hi> out of <note n="d" place="margin">Genes. 3.</note> Paradise: it threw <note n="e" place="margin">1 Sam. 15.</note> 
               <hi>Saul</hi> downe from the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome: and, had <hi>Abraham</hi> done the like: had he not, when he saw the Commandement, euen contrary to Nature and Reason, suffered the Commander to be wise and dispute for him, hee had ouerthrowne his Faith. It was judiciously said by a wise man of latter
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:1702:20"/>
dayes, that if hee were enioyned by his superiours to put forth into the Sea in a ship, which had neyther maste nor tackling, nor any furniture or prouision, he would doe it. And being asked, what wisedome were that Sir? answered, The wisedome must be in him that hath power to command, not in him which is bound to obey. How farre are we from such obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, which hauing expresse commandement in Gods word, doe ouerthrow all with our worldly wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and the reason of our flesh? How likely is it that we will offer to God <hi>Izhak</hi> our joy: which will not sacrifice the Ramme, that is, mortifie our sinfull lusts, and the desires of our flesh? We forfeit our o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bediences to God in cheape almes, and costlesse prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and sweet loues, and wholesome dueties. Wee serue him neyther in deede nor word, nor substance, nor shew of holinesse; but hauing broken all the bands of our obedience to God, doe not onely not offer to God, but daily take from him, fayning and counterfeiting new wayes of ease, and liberty to serue God, in such as sound pleasing to the eares of our flesh: if God enjoyne any thing which crosseth our appoyntments with the world, wee slide backe and shake off the Word, like the Capernaits, saying; <note n="a" place="margin">Iohn 6. 60.</note> 
               <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus est hic sermo: this is an hard saying, who can bide it?</hi> How farre then is our life differing from the liues of all Gods Saints, which serued him in wants, in affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, in fasting, in being tempted, in continuall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise and triall of their Faith? Their scope was obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, ours skill; their indeauour was onely refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of their life; our vertue nothing but hearing; they in the practise of their Religion wearied chiefly their knees and their hands; wee our eares and our tongues. We are growne (as in many things else) to a kinde of intemperancy, which onely Sermons ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>excepted,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:1702:20"/>
hath put all other duties of religion out of course: Well, we must know, that our duty to God, consisteth not onely in hearing these. This is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of vs all, to be followers of the faith of our Father <hi>Abraham;</hi> if not in actuall renouncing all that we haue, yet in a will, ready, and prepared thereto, as often as it shall please GOD to put vs to the triall. Let vs then see how a mind deuoted and consecrated to the seruice of God, may put, I will not say all lesser temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, but euen this tryall which was laid on <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> himselfe to flight?</p>
            <p>First, who doth aske this? the great God of Heauen, the Diuine Maiesty: Is not this an vnspeakable mercy and vouchsafing shewed to me, that he will aske of me any thing?</p>
            <p>Againe, who requireth this of me? He indeed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which first gaue me that, which now he asketh from me. See how louingly God dealeth with me: he willeth me to giue it; and I doe nothing but repay it: for I haue <note n="a" place="margin">1 Cor. 4. 18.</note> nothing but what I first receaued from God, no not my onely Sonne.</p>
            <p>But of whom doth he aske him? Of me his most vnworthy seruant: Whatsoeuer I haue, is vnworthy, and too little for him: not my Sonne onely, but my heart.</p>
            <p>Nay, but why he doth demand him? not to take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way my Sonne which I onely loue, but to giue me ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny moe. He will recompense my little sorrow of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saking him, with a doubled and trebbled ioy of recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing him againe. Thus I loose a little comfort in <hi>Izhak,</hi> to finde a greater in God.</p>
            <p>And doth not God daily offer to me? He offereth me <note n="b" place="margin">Gen. 13. 15.</note> Land, Gold, <note n="c" place="margin">Gen 20. 16.</note> Siluer, Sheepe, Camels, <note n="d" place="margin">Gen 20. 14.</note> Oxen; he offereth me Grace, he offreth me Life, <note n="e" place="margin">Gen 28. 14.</note> he offereth me <note n="f" place="margin">Gen. 15. 1.</note> Himselfe: shall I giue him nothing backe againe?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:1702:21"/>
But <hi>Abraham</hi> is now old and striken in yeares. So much fitter to sacrifice a Sonne; which hath made so continuall a sacrifice of himselfe.</p>
            <p>But he must substitute his Sonne to die in the place of a Beast. We are neuer more glorious, and hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, then when we make ourselues vile before God. This was <hi>Dauids</hi> case, when <hi>Michol</hi> despised him in her heart, for vilenesse, like a Foole. <note n="f" place="margin">2 Sam. 6. 21. 22.</note> 
               <hi>It was before the Lord: and I will be yet more vile then thus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But God may make choyse of many more sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces? The beasts <note n="g" place="margin">Psa 50. 10.</note> of the field are his, and the cattle of a thousand Mountaines. And is not my Sonne his? and might not he take him away without asking?</p>
            <p>But this is contrary to Nature and Fatherly affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Abraham</hi> had learned that Gospell: <note n="h" place="margin">Mat. 10. 37.</note> 
               <hi>Whose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer loueth, Sonne or Daughter, more then Me, is not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of Me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But my Sonne is innocent.</p>
            <p>So much the fitter to be sacrificed to God, and to beare the type of his Sonne CHRIST.</p>
            <p>What then is the report of men, or the racke of three daies iourny, or the making to my selfe a ruthful spectacle, or the sprinkling of his bloud, but a farther meanes to engraue and record my obedience to God?</p>
            <p>Thus we see, the tentation is avoyded by obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and recompensed with comfort vnspeakable: Whereas all these griefes which did rent and wound <hi>Abrahams</hi> heart, were sent to open and enlarge his breast, and make more roome for ioy in his heart. And this maketh for our consolation, that now at last the Law of God, may enter into our hearts, and mealt and dissolue our bowels into tendernesse and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion: seeing the same God which spared our Sonne, I meane <hi>Izhak,</hi> when he was to be offered to him:

If this suffice not, God the Father offereth to vs yet his Sonne IESVS CHRIST, to euery heart that is grieued; to euery soule that is vexed. He is offred to vile sinners, to vnworthy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceauers: he is offered so truly, so fully, so franckely, as no heart can conceaue, no thought can compre hend.

            <p>Some considering this worlds euils with a worldly regard, nakednesse, pouerty, troubles, crosses, dangers; haue iudged it a prison, or place of vexation: others looking into the apparant good; as honour, riches, pleasures, with which the world doth not onely allure, but rauish her louers: haue deemed it a Paradise, or place of delight. But they which view it ouer with a spirituall eye, and attend the danger of their soules, the hazard of their country, the multitude of their spirituall enemies; say, <hi>Militia est potius, quid enim con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curret? horae momento aut cita mors venit, aut victoria laeta.</hi>

               <hi>It is a kinde of warring: for we encounter on euery side in the moment of an houre, either quick death commeth, or ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full victory.</hi> For Saint <hi>Paul</hi> which fought from his <note n="a" place="margin">Act. 7. 58.</note> Youth vp, euen to <hi>Paul</hi> 
               <note n="b" place="margin">Philem. 9.</note> the Aged; counted it <note n="c" place="margin">2 Cor. 4. 11.</note> but a momentary fight. This <hi>horae momentum, is mans whole life:</hi> which be it all spent in hazard of fight, hath the comparison, but of an eyes twinkling to the purchase of the victory, and life eternall. And in this moment of an houre we are all lost or saued. That our life is a warfare we are taught by the Sacrament of our cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in Baptisme: where we take an oath to fight; against the Flesh, the World, and the Diuell. There we remember our first presse-peny of grace; and haue professed our selues souldiours of Christ, to fight vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his Banner. Our Sauiour Christ chargeth the
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:1702:23"/>
watch in his Gospell: <hi>Watch and Pray, that you fall not into temptation.</hi> And giueth this charge not onely to the leaders, and captaines of his band; but to euery common souldier, <note n="e" place="margin">Mat. 26 41.</note> 
               <hi>that which I say to you, I say to all, Watch.</hi> We haue our munition out of Holy Scriptures, which are like <hi>Solomons Tower,</hi> 
               <note n="f" place="margin">Mar. 13. 37.</note> 
               <hi>where hang a thousand sheildes, and all the weapons of strong men.</hi> The Apostle <note n="g" place="margin">Cant. 4. 4.</note> sounds the alarum, <hi>Arme, arme, take the whole armour of God, from the heads helmet, to the feete:</hi> We must lie open at no place, for our enimie is a Serpent: if he can but bite the heele, he will transfuse his venime to the heart, and to the head. And in one side we see the faithfull in perpetuall agony, striuing, wrestling, figh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting: now receauing in the buckler of their faith, the dints of affliction and temptation; now char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging the enimy as in open fight. For which cause the Apostle doth not onely encourage others <note n="h" place="margin">Eph. 6. 13.</note> to fight a good fight, but desireth to be seene in the fore-front, <note n="i" place="margin">1 Tim. 1. 18.</note> 
               <hi>hauing the same fight which you haue seene in me.</hi> And therefore summeth vp all his labours, for CHRIST and his Gospel in these few words: <hi>I</hi> 
               <note n="k" place="margin">Phi. 1. vlt.</note> 
               <hi>haue fought a good fight.</hi> On the other side we see so many multitudes, led captiues vnder diuers lustes, of whom the Deuill hath his will and hath taken them as an easie pray, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <note n="l" place="margin">2 Tim. 2. 26.</note> 
               <hi>at his pleasure.</hi> 
               <note n="m" place="margin">Phil. 3. 16.</note> 
               <hi>Now enimies of the crosse of Christ.</hi> He that warreth vpon an other, doth he not entend to make him tributary, and make his people his seruants? So doth Satan warre against CHRIST.: and being not able to vanquish him, doth yet preuaile to draw from him such as were his sworne seruants; causing them to fight vnder him for wages of damnation. Lastly that we may be out of doubt, that our life is a warfare; our Sauiour saith: <note n="n" place="margin">Mat. 11. 12.</note> 
               <hi>the kingdom of Heauen suffreth violence, &amp; the violent pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sesse it.</hi> So that nothing is more cleere then this point:
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:1702:23"/>
we must haue warre for our country, we must win it by force and violence. Whether it be because the earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly man doth seeke it, because from beneath he aspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth to it, because he wrestleth not onely against <note n="o" place="margin">1 Cor. 15. 32.</note> outward enemies, whether Carnall or <note n="p" place="margin">Eph. 6. 12.</note> Spirituall wickednesse, but against his owne <note n="q" place="margin">Mat. 10. 37. 38. 39.</note> will, and desire, and loue, and against himselfe, to attaine this king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome; whether it be that the short compasse of our life draweth vs with that swiftnesse that we must reach with violence at that, which with such violence is taken from vs; or that the aboundance of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly treasure, so enflameth with desire the hearts of Gods chosen, that they contemne all dangers, and runne through all lets and euils, to win it: or lastly, for that the <note n="r" place="margin">Ex. 17.</note> Amalekites of this world, while we are here fainting and weary in the way, smite vs: for that here be Caananits which must be expulsed, before we can attaine the land of Promise, and <hi>Sehons</hi> and <hi>Oggs,</hi> Giants of monstrous stature, to appale and affright vs. But say the kingdome of Heauen suffreth violence: and what can we get here but by violence? Seeke we then with the same violence the things in heauen, with which wicked men doe seeke the things of this world. Heere we can get nothing without labour, watching, trouble, venture, fight; doe but the same, and see Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen is offered: how much difference in the endes: and see, the meanes of both are one.</p>
            <p>But let vs see how our life is a warfare. <note n="s" place="margin">Cor. 10 4.</note> 
               <hi>Arma militiae nostrae non sunt carnalia: the weapons of our warfare are not carnal,</hi> our enimies would esteem these as straw or <note n="t" place="margin">Iob. 41. 18.</note> stub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. They would mock such a battaile. They beare this armour whom we esteem poore and naked men. These fights they fight, whom we esteem base and cowardly; our enimy the Deuil is a subtile &amp; cruel enimy, he striks within, he wounds the hart, whom Christs champions
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:1702:24"/>
doe vanquish with their bloud-shed, and their flesh battered. When God shut man, for sinne, out of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radise, he set the <note n="a" place="margin">Genes. 3. 24.</note> Cherubims, and the blade of a Sword shaken, to keepe the way of the tree of Life.</p>
            <p>But now Christ is entred into <note n="b" place="margin">Luke 23. 43.</note> Paradise, and hath left the Sword sticking in their flesh, which will enter into life: so that good Christians must be as <hi>E. paminondas, Nonsolliciti de vita sed de scuto: Is my buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler safe?</hi> 
               <note n="c" place="margin">Ephes. 6. 16.</note> 
               <hi>is our Faith sure?</hi> For our enemy, neither the goodnesse of our cause, neither the succour and help we haue from heauen, can affright: Our Innocency shall not shield vs from him, he will strike at the elect, hee will assault those whose names are written in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen. He careth not for our armour of light, but will dart the fiery darts of temptation, euen at the buckler of our Faith. He stroke at the head: hee attempted to shake the Rocke <note n="d" place="margin">Math. 4. 6.</note> Iesus Christ: will he feare the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers? whether then we fight with Sathan in person, or with any of his cursed band. Let vs see how farre diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent this fight is from all other fights.</p>
            <p>If I fight against a man, I whet my sword; but <note place="margin">2.</note> when I am to deale with my spirituall enemy, I must blunt my sword; the reason is: Against man I vse my owne weapons, but heere the Diuell vseth my wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons, that is, the members of my flesh: I must by all means make this flesh vnprofitable for my enemy. So Saint <hi>Paul</hi> did dull his sword, <hi>Castigo corpus meum, I</hi>

And it mattereth not whether he seeke our subucrsion by himselfe, or by his sworne seruants: For as when a Prince suborneth his subiect to worke treason vpon his enemy, the benefit redoundeth to the Prince, not to the subject: so when men draw vs from God, the booty is the Diuells. O where doth not this subtile Serpent lurke? what station haue the Souldiers of Christ without danger? where can we put our selues without perill of falling. Wee haue a night and clandesline enemy, which neuer ceaseth to subuert, ruinate, and destroy. If we had to doe with a bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enemy, wee might sleepe or intermit the watch:

Wee haue seene this our arch-enemy ruling o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer all the Nations of the world, fortifying himselfe like a great Monarch, with bands of Atheists, and Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous, hauing built himselfe Altars and Temples in the heathen, as strong holdes, bearing visible sway, and carrying the Kingdomes of the earth in open tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph. We haue seene how hee hath warred with the Saints in the Primitiue Church, and how deare the cause of Iesus Christ stoode the Apostles and Martires in, which prodigall of their liues and bloud, charged the enemy in open fight, and cast him out: rescuing kingdomes and subduing the Nations of the world to Christ and his Gospell: howbeit hee hath made a reentry, hauing gotten the signiory in Africke, and holds them as a prey. More, he raungeth ouer the great Asia, and hath laid it waste: I, hee is entred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Europe; and like the surging and ouerflowing o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cean, frets at the shoare, seeking to breake the bounds, hauing gotten ground of the Church: but what doe I speake of outlings which haue yeelded ouer: see how he hath drawne the Starres from heauen?

And if euill were then to be feared; how is it now, when the enemy commeth out of the sides and bowells of the Church? when he is gotten into the Pulpits, and hath diuided our small number, and pretending no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the pure Word hath sowen that sedition, that parts are taken, that it is growne to mutiny to sides, that almost through the whole kingdome eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry towne is at open faction; Preacher against Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher; hearer against hearer? One side goes from the Sermon discouraged, and marked out for reprobate: the other hath grace and comfort, as solely elected: Then spies are sent abroad for more hearers: this man is graced and magnified as the onely Preacher; if an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other come, they will not heare him. And hath not this fiery disposition attended to ruinate the very

foundation of the Church, as in Brownists and Barro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wists. But you will say these are zealous and godly men; they minde but to mend the couering, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter somewhat of the old building. Be not deceiued, for it is to be feared they will downe with all: for the new sides doe heare them as the onely Preachers, and they haue cast imputation on their fellowes, of Errour and Popery. But be not deceiued, deare Christians, these are not they which brought you out of darkenes into light: which stoode and fought for your Faith and the Gospell, when the Truth was at a lowe ebbe, and the Church had neede of stowt Souldiers in the cause of Christ.</p>

               <hi>What wee should not be.]</hi> Wee must not be intangled with worldly businesse. I take not any of these words metaphorically spoken: but in the first and proper sense: for bodily fights are but shadowes to this of the spirit, which is the onely true fight: and say we must borrow words, for our better vnderstanding, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse spirituall things in their kinde: earthly things doe lend heauenly things words, but heauenly things doe lend earthly things signification. So they which fight but for earthly things, doe not, till they haue gotten the victory, meddle with the things of this world; much lesse should we which goe in warfare for heauen. For this implication or stopping at things
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:1702:31"/>
in the way, is a let to the victory: which if it came but single and by it selfe, were farre more to be desired of a good souldier, than any thing which can be had without it. But the victory brings in these spoyles with it, and whatsoeuer else mans heart can desire: e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially this victory, after which shall be no more warre, <note n="a" place="margin">1 Cor. 15. 26. &amp; 55. 56.</note> no enemy left; and the purchase shall bring with it all spoyles, riches, honour, security, peace, triumph, glory and blisse eternall. If we could consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the benefit and fruit of this victory, all the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes of the earth could not serue to make one fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to tie vs heere: and those greene cords of the loue of riches, and worldly pleasure, and honour, which so binde our desires, we should breake, as <hi>Samson</hi> did his Bands, like to Towe when it hath felt the fire: So absurdly then doe they which neglect this end, to which they are called, and lie ensnared with impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of emoluments which lie in the way: as if a man, being shewed where a rich treasure lay, should neglect to digge it forth, contenting himselfe with the Rushes and Bennets, which grow vpon the ground.</p>
            <p>I will content my selfe onely to resemble these men to such as catch at the spoyles before the enemy is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthrowne, or the battell wonne: whose first let is, because that <hi>ardor pugnandi,</hi> that alacrity of the minde, and heate to fight, which should be in a Souldier, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to cease. This we see in many worldlings, which beganne with a zeale and feruor of the spirit; but that heate and burning of the spirit is now abated and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarded. They grow colder and colder to heauenly things, till at last they shrinke and fall away. If they be not starke cold, yet they are not hot: and of such we may heare the Apostle complayne, <note n="b" place="margin">2 Tim. 4. 10.</note>

Secondly, being made rich, they grow timerous: For the nature of these earthly things is, to beget diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and feares, and jealousie; because our worldly riches haue many suiters, and many competitours, which seeke by flattery and sleight to vndermine our estates, and pilfer away our happinesse: so many ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, not onely of rust and mothes, but of <hi rend="sup">a</hi>

            <p>There is no doubt but as often as God appeared to our Fathers, making himselfe manifest by some signe: so often hee stouped downe from the height of his Majesty, and (as wee may thinke) went forth from himselfe, to come nearer to them. For that which is most vnworthy of that Diuine majestie, to borrow a Body or a Face of his Creatures for a time, is yet the greatest vouchsafing: wherewith hee can vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safe vs, and the possiblest meanes he hath, to make vs, whiles we are here in the flesh, attentiue, and to won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der at his greatnes. The same God doth stoupe downe and bow himselfe to vs when he speaketh and calleth by his word out of the lippes and mouthes of his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets and Ministers: and there is no difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene that trembled Majesty; which spake to <hi>Moses</hi> miraculously, and to vs ordinarily. But this is the end of extraordinary calling, that they haue extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:1702:35"/>
effects: &amp; to whom God doth appeare by strange and fearefull signes and wonders, in them he sheweth more wondred workes of his power.</p>
            <p>Had not God called <hi>Moses,</hi> who could haue per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded a silly poore man, a shepheard, in the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernesse, such an one as <note n="a" place="margin">Chap. 2. 15.</note> before fled from the face of one man, to oppose himselfe to a mighty kingdome, to a whole Nation? Had not God inspired, how could one naked man, with a little wand in his hand, whip <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and his kingdome, and smite the whole land, and hauing first beaten him with haile and <note n="b" place="margin">Exodus 9. 24.</note> stormes, after he had almost eaten him vp with Lice, <hi>Exodus</hi> 8 17. and Caterpillers, <hi>Exodus</hi> 10. 13, after hee had shaken him with thunders, and scorched and blasted him with lightnings, <hi>Exodus</hi> 9. 23. powre him out and his whole hoste, like dregges into the Sea?</p>
            <p>Now for the calling of <hi>Moses,</hi> wee must consider this followed another calling of his: namely, his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward calling, with which he was called before: it was <note place="margin">
                  <hi>c</hi> Exodus 2. 11. Hebr. 11. 27.</note> then an outward calling, yet not that outward which is opposed to the inward: for so, <hi>many are called:</hi> But a certaine deputation of a purpose which God would <note place="margin">
                  <hi>d</hi> Mat. 20. 16.</note> publish and make manifest by him, whom by warrant of this calling, as by Commission, he would authorize to sit in his owne place, and to visite <hi>Pharaohs</hi> house: in regard whereof he saith; <note n="e" place="margin">Exodus 7. 1.</note> 
               <hi>I will make thee Pharaohs God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So now <hi>Moses</hi> considering the highnesse of him that calleth him, shall little regard how vilely men e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steeme of him, being assigned by him, before whom, not onely all earthly Kings and their kingdomes, but the heauens themselues are lovve.</p>
            <p>And againe; <hi>Moses</hi> considering the power of him that calleth him, shall now despise his owne weaknes, and a thousand slow tongues.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="63" facs="tcp:1702:35"/>
And further, looking into the end for which he is called, to deliuer his brethren from their bondage; and affliction; shall comfort himselfe, not onely against the hardnesse of his labour, and the obstinacie of blind <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> but against the bitter murmurings of his own brethren, and the hardnesse of their hearts.</p>
            <p>And lastly, <hi>Moses</hi> calling to heart that wonderfull vouchsafing of the Diuine majesty; first, in looking vpon a people which were afflicted with so cruell bondage; but especially in looking on him, which was afflicted by the afflicted in a lower degree of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery than bondage: to make him their Leader, to make him <hi>Pharaohs</hi> God, to furnish him with all helpes, to grace him with the familiarity of his owne presence: how gladly shall hee consecrate all his power and strength to this seruice, to Gods businesse, with care, with resolution, with all his heart?</p>
            <p>But we must obserue, that albe, it be heere written, <hi>God called him;</hi> yet in the second Verse, we finde the <hi>Angell of the Lord appeared to him.</hi> If we desire to know who this Angell should be, which in the sixt Chapter, <hi>verse</hi> 3. calleth himselfe by the name of <hi>Ieho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uah,</hi> and taketh to him the glory of the eternall God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, wee may safely with the Fathers, take him for the eternall Sonne of God, in regard of his person of a Mediator:. Which person albeit he did after take vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, when in the fulnesse of time hee tooke our flesh, yet he bore the figure and image thereof from the beginning. And to this purpose, Saint <hi>Paul</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth him the <hi rend="sup">a</hi> Leader of the people in the desart. For albeit he were not yet come, yet might his Predesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to that office, be of that force, that hee might make himselfe knowne to the Fathers vnder no other <note place="margin">

               <hi>appoynted I will returne vnto thee, according to the time of life:)</hi> It is no extraordinary thing: for the Prophets themselues, which beare Gods message, doe sometimes take vpon them Gods person, and speake as God speaketh: as <note n="d" place="margin">2 Reg 6. 16.</note> 
               <hi>Elisha,</hi> second of <hi>Kings, Ch</hi> 6. <hi>vers.</hi> 16. which vseth the same words: and <hi>Eliah,</hi> the first of <hi>Kings, Ch.</hi> 21. 20.</p>
            <p>Onely this may suffice to be gathered from this place, that whatsoeuer God speaketh by his Angels, is of as much certayntie as if Gods owne mouth had spoken it, I if he leaue Angels, and chuse Shepheards and Fishermen to doe his message, the authority is no lesse then if it had beene thundred from Heauen, or vttered by an hoast of Angels, or written in the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens, or spoken from Heauen by the mouth of the Sonne of God, from the right hand of God: for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Angels of Gods Church heere on earth be by no meanes to be compared with those blessed mindes, for excellency of substance or immortality, or purenesse from sinne: yet are they not inferiour to them in respect of their message, if they be not aboue them in regard of their office: which is greater then to sit vpon the Spheares of Heauen, and to bring the Sunne to his daily course: to vphold the earth, to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose seasons and times, to inflict famines and pesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence: for to them only is committed the dispensation
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:1702:36"/>

               <hi>when heauen and earth are passed away:</hi> and for this cause, although an Angell appeared to <note n="e" place="margin">Act. 13. 6.</note> 
               <hi>Cornelius,</hi> he went no farther then to messenger him to Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> which should tell him what he should doe: I, when CHRIST <note n="f" place="margin">Act. 9. 4.</note> himself appeared to <hi>Saul,</hi> and spake to him from Heauen, yet he gaue to <hi>Ananias</hi> this honour, that he should be the instrument of his conuersion, and of his receiuing the holy Ghost. Let no man then now looke to be <note n="g" place="margin">Vers. 17.</note> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led out of a bush burning with fire, or by a voyce from heauen, sithence God doth as vndoubtedly call vs daily out of the mouthes of his Ministers and Preachers, and speake by them as familiarly as he did by <hi>Moses:</hi> and if they be Ministers to you of Grace, and Life, and the riches and glory of the Kingdome of heauen; let it not grieue you with good conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to be Ministers to them of the perishing things of this world: neyther despise you them, because they are men, and sinners as you are: for God which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted them, did it not for want of Angels; but in calling them, he preferreth your nature. Hee knowes their vnworthines better then you, yet he honoureth them: Doe you dishonour them whom God honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth? What then? doe you blaspheme the good of your brethren, for which you are to giue God thanks? I, and some there are which load them with disgrace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full termes, and rayling words, such as the <note n="h" place="margin">Iud. 9.</note> Angell sustayned not to giue to the Diuell himselfe. The spirit
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:1702:37"/>
himselfe calleth that blinde and carelesse Minister the <note n="b" place="margin">Apoc 3. 14.</note> Angell of his <hi>Church:</hi> Doe we esteeme them whom the mouth of God calleth Angels, as the basest of all men? Are you wiser then the holy Ghost? or can you constitute a better forme of gouernment in Gods Church then God himselfe hath ordayned? Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse none can set little by the Ministers of <note n="c" place="margin">Ioh. 15. 18.</note> Christ, but they which haue hated him first. Wee cannot reach at his Heauens, we cannot touch his Sunne nor Starres, nor disorder the least of his workes heere on earth, and yet we oppose our selues to that, to which God hath giuen a farre more excellent being, namely, <hi>the word of truth,</hi> the image of his glory, the sword of of his Iustice, the Scepter of his Kingdome.</p>
            <p>Our second circumstance followeth. The Place ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, out of which <hi>Moses</hi> is called; the <hi>Desart,</hi> &amp;c. The <note place="margin">2</note> 
               <note n="d" place="margin">Psal. 139. 8.</note> Prophet shewing that no man can flie from the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of God: neyther by ascending into Heauen, or lying in Hell, or dwelling in the Sea, &amp;c. As hee pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth, that if we doe wickedly, we lye open alwayes to the vengeance &amp; wrath of God; so he enforceth, that if we doe well, nothing can take our reward from vs. What maruell if then God search the Wildernesse for his seruant <hi>Moses:</hi> doth he not vse to search for his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants, the <note n="e" place="margin">Dan. 6. 22.</note> dennes of Lyons, <note n="f" place="margin">Dan. 3 24.</note> and fiery Ouens, <note n="g" place="margin">Ion. 2. 17.</note> and the bottome of the Sea, and the bottome <note n="h" place="margin">Ioh. 11. 38.</note> of the graue? For as he reioyceth to bring hidden wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse to open punishment; so he more delighteth to bring secret godlinesse to open light and glory. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though then <hi>Moses</hi> thou be cast forth into the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernesse, into the place of Dragons, to haue thy abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding with <note n="i" place="margin">Isay. 13. 2<gap reason="illegible" extent="1+ letters">

               <hi>Zym,</hi> and Dragons, and Ostriches, and <hi>Ohim, &amp;c.</hi> yet heere God looketh vpon thee. The same God which saw thee <note n="k" place="margin">Cap. 2. 13.</note> when thou fleddest from thy Brother: I, the same God which saw thee when thy

            <p>We see, as the littlenesse or vnaptnesse of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, cannot hinder God in executing by them works of wonder, no more can the vnlikelinesse or vnapt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the place. He can make as many Springs to flow out of the rocky Desart, as from <hi>Apenninus,</hi> the father of Riuers: hee can store the waste and roaring Wildernesse with as much prouision as fruitfull <hi>Aegypt:</hi> he can leuye as great an Armie from <hi>Sina</hi> bushes, as from the middest of <hi>Pharaohs</hi> Kingdome.</p>
            <p>But what is the reason that God appeareth to <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,</hi> rather in the Wildernesse then in <hi>Aegypt.</hi> Haue the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> onely driuen out <hi>Moses</hi> from them?

He cannot abide in <hi>Pharaohs</hi> Court, there is so much hardnesse in <hi>Phara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ohs</hi> hart: he cannot abide in their land for their cruelty, nor in their Temples for their Idolatry: It was a poore entertaynement, that the Lord of life, when he came to dwell with vs, and to inhabite our flesh; that hee must be driuen to seeke the Asses cratch, and that our vnthankefulnesse did thrust the God of life into a Stable: but it was harder that quietly the Babe IE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SVS could not enioy that, but <hi>Mary</hi> must be driuen to flie by the way of the Wildernesse) into <note n="m" place="margin">Mat. 2. 14.</note> 
               <hi>Aegypt,</hi> to hide her Sonne, for feare of <hi>Herod</hi> and the Iewes. Why doe we thus banish God from vs, and chase him forth into remote, and farre Countries, from whence he will not returne but to smite vs, and iudge vs, as he did the <hi>Aegiptians</hi> heere? Why doth hee rather dwell in the thornie bush then in <hi>Pharaohs</hi> heart? He is not in <hi>Samaria,</hi> but he is in the Desart with <note n="n" place="margin">2 Reg. 19.</note>

            <p>Now touching the Vision. No doubt but <hi>Moses</hi> was wonderfully astonished with the miracle: he go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth aside, to wonder, to gaze at this strange sight. But these, if thou compare, <hi>Moses,</hi> with those miracles which God wil worke by thee; with those great won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders in Aegypt, with his continuall appearing to thee in a Cloude by day, and in a Pillar of fire by night: This burning flame, I say, if thou compare with these, and with Mount <note n="e" place="margin">Exod. 19. 18.</note> Sinai, burning all with fire, it shall seeme to be but a little sparke.</p>
            <p>And yet that great deliuerance of Gods people, which was wrought by <hi>Moses,</hi> at which all the earth trembled, which filled all hearts with astonishment, which was done with so mighty an hand, &amp; outstret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched arme; compare we it to our deliuerance in Iesu Christ; and it will seeme but as shadow to a body: and lesse indeede than a little sparkle to a great flame.

            <p>Come we how to the manner of his calling, which is the fourth in order. Heere wee earne first, that this <note place="margin">4.</note> was no dumbe shew, to terrifie the holy man: For it hath Doctrine annexed to establish his minde. And
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:1702:39"/>
indeede the miracle is great, but the calling of <hi>Moses</hi> is greater. And God calleth <hi>Moses</hi> by name, familiar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, which telleth him, that now hee hath a kinde of fellowship and acquaintance with God: that he must now walke with God, and forget his father and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance in the flesh, and his flocke of sheepe, and the world, and follow his calling. For God by speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to him in this sort, doth enter and insinuate him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe into his minde; and moue him to regard his dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly walking, as a continuall judging. For how must they walke, with whom Gods eie doth alwayes walke, as an indiuiduall <note n="a" place="margin">Ierem. 16. 17.</note> companion? Now God by name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vs when hee calleth, shewes, that hee knowes vs when he speaketh not. He calls vs in time, he knowes vs before time: when he calleth, he is not neerer to vs than he was before, but he teacheth vs to draw nearer, to him. But this is the least we can imagine of God, to thinke hee walketh with vs as an indiuiduall compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion: for hee walketh in our soule, and betweene the diuisions of our spirit, and treadeth a secret path in our heart and vnderstanding, which no man know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth but himselfe. There is neuer a fold or wrinkle in our minde, but he knoweth it altogether.</p>
            <p>Neither is this so onely; God is nearer to vs than we are to our selues. He seeth ten thousand things in our minde and thought, which we see not: therefore Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> saith, <note n="b" place="margin">Iohn 3. 20.</note> 
               <hi>God is greater than our heart.</hi> To our thought, men, and Angells are blinde; to God our thought is blinde. How many sinnes can hee object which haue fled the secretnes of our thought? What is more ignorant to him than our best vnderstanding? How many things which he will doe by vs, doth hee better know before they are done, than we after? Well may the Prophet say, <hi>Such</hi> 
               <note n="c" place="margin">Psal. 3. 19. 6.</note> 
               <hi>knowledge is too wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for me:</hi> Neither may we wonder at any thing more
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:1702:39"/>
than that the trembled presence of God is no more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded of vs. We shame not to doe that in the presence of God, which we blush to doe in the sight of the worst Boy we keepe. The first step that wee should tread in our calling, should be the forsaking of the world: I, of our selues. The world will not onely entangle vs, if we stand still, but if wee runne through it. Our cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling is a daily striuing, and a continuall fight: and the Countrey we seeke, must be <note n="a" place="margin">Math. 11.</note> wonne by violence.</p>

<pb n="72" facs="tcp:1702:40"/>
to vs: we haue turned our backes to him. He hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen vs a long time to sinne. The childe which was <note place="margin">

If wee, not knowing how highly wee are descended, haue thought it good to intangle our selues with the things of this world, too base and meane for our calling. If perishing and vaine things haue held vs contented to leade our liues in this thrall and basenesse; yet now, knowing wee are more than the sons of Kings, I, <note n="b" place="margin">Rom. 8. 14. 17</note> sonnes of the most High God, and heires of his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, let vs not deferreto flie the shadow of this world, and to lift vp our selues to that glory which is prepared for vs; knowing that our heauenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, not onely looketh for our comming, but daily sendeth and calleth for vs.</p>
            <p>Now a word of the Prohibition. <hi>Moses</hi> had ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured <note place="margin">6.</note> too farre, forgetting himselfe; drawne as men are, rashly to gaze and prie into strange sights. But this is not the way to come before God, by aspiring, and curiousnesse, but with reuerence and trembling. When wee cast our selues downe lowest, when wee stand farthest off in humilitie, then are we neerest to God. If we consider our vanitie and presumption, we are many times too neere to God: but in feare and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence wee are neuer neere enough. But it is worth the noting; how <hi>Moses</hi> is called, and forbidden to come neere.</p>
            <p>When the Angell was sent to <hi>Mary,</hi> whose aspect and presence troubled her, she was forbidden to feare: <note n="c" place="margin">Luke 1. 30.</note> 
               <hi>Feare not Maery.</hi> But, this Angell appearing to <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,</hi> because he is not troubled at the sight, hee is in a
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:1702:40"/>
manner commanded to feare, and stand farther off. The blessed Virgin was forbidden to feare, because she had found fauour with God: and <hi>Moses</hi> is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to feare, because he knowes not what fauour hee had found. For he gazed onely, as one that sawe a strange sight by chance, not looking into Gods vouchsafing; not considering what mercy God shews him. But being instructed by God, you neede not bid him feare, as we see in his standing off. And such is the weakenes and vilenes of vs mortall men, that we cannot sustayne the sight and presence of the least of Gods Angells without shaking and trembling, though they appeare in a forme, tempered and suited to our weakenesse: Therefore, when <hi>Mary</hi> the mother of Christ saw the Angell, <note n="a" place="margin">Luke 1. 29.</note>

               <hi>Feare not.</hi> And an Angell is neuer almost sent, but with a <hi>Feare not</hi> in his mouth, but the effect is good: for when the trembled presence of God hath possessed vs of an wholesome reuerence and feare of the Diuine maiesty, hee doth by words of comfort take it away, shewing that he is great for our good, and for the confusion of our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. So our feare and reuerence is invited, our cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riositie and presumption is rejected. But this I say, if Gods presence be so fearefull when in greatest mercie and compassion hee appeareth, how trembled is his wrath? And if wee may be faulty in approaching neare to God: of what terrible wrath shall our Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stasies and falling from God be guilty? And this is the same <hi>Moses</hi> which after desired to see <note n="e" place="margin">Exod. 33. 18.</note> 
               <hi>Gods face;</hi> and not able to see it, doth most notably teach vs, that the strength of our Saluation is not farre from the cleft of the Rocke, in which Gods mercifull hand hath hid vs, and couered vs, till he shall take vs out of the

VVas there any weaknesse in his arme, any crookednesse in his path? VVas hee like the sonnes of men; whose breath is in their nostrills?

               <hi>from thy feets:</hi> By these words God doth stirre him vp and prouoke him to further Deuotion and Reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence. This ceremony of standing bare-foote before GOD, is like our kneeling and vncouering in the Church. And of all ceremonies this is the end, that Gods trembled Majesty, may haue a more effectuall working in vs. <hi>Moses</hi> had shewed a reasonable readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse to his calling before, <hi>Here am I:</hi> he hath yet need to be more stirred vp.

Hierarch. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 5. <hi>part.</hi> 1.</p>
            <p>And thus we are come to our last part: <hi>For the place where thou standest is holy ground.</hi> If we make this the reason of that first <hi>come not neare,</hi> we haue a suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient warrant to manifest our dutie to God in all places: for God filleth <note n="c" place="margin">Psal. 139. 7.</note> all places with his presence: <hi>Whither shall I goe from thy presence? Coelum &amp; terram ego impleo:</hi> I fill <note n="d" place="margin">Ier. 23. 24.</note> Heauen and Earth saith the Lord. In respect of our weaknesse, he seemeth to be lesse present to some place: but as he is in himselfe, he is a like present in all. We haue a more awfull regard of God, where he sheweth more signes of his excellence; but he worketh infinitely aboue our vnderstanding, euen there, where he sheweth no signe at all. But let vs rather construe this of the holinesse of the ground, for a reason of that which went next before, why he must put off his shoes from his feete. We haue this doctrine hence. First, the holinesse of the place doth witnesse Gods presence: secondly, it moueth vs to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward reuerence and feare: thirdly it telleth vs what we
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:1702:42"/>
ought to be: Shall the place be holy, when wee are prophane, Where we must not tread amisse, must we thinke amisse? where <hi>Moses</hi> must not weare shoes on his feete; shall he carry wickednesse in his heart? Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard we what men see, and despise we the eyes of God? for <note n="e" place="margin">Psal. 51. 5.</note> 
               <hi>God requireth truth of the inward parts;</hi> yet so, that he refuseth not the worship of the outward parts, which if he would euer haue refused, he would haue done so heere; for God saw <hi>Moses</hi> heart, and none were present but God and <hi>Moses,</hi> heere was no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation assembled; none that might learne by out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ceremony or behauiour, and yet God, which <note n="f" place="margin">Iohn 4. 24.</note> is a Spirit, and worshipped in spirit saith: <hi>Moses, put off thy shoes from thy feete, for the place where thou standest is holy ground.</hi> If <hi>Moses</hi> stood before God in holy ground: where God appeared to him in a bush burning with fire; how holy must our standings be before him, which haue him not within kenning onely, or at a gaze, or where wee are forbidden to come, but in the <note n="g" place="margin">Mat. 18. 20.</note> middest of vs? If Mount Sinai were sanctified for a temporall residence, what shall wee thinke of these Mountaines, our Temples, dedicated to his glory and worship; to which hee hath promised <note n="h" place="margin">Mat, 28. <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>
               </note> a presence for euer? If God did discend to the low Bramble-bush, and sanctifie it: doe you thinke he will abandon his Temples, where we daily come together in his name? If God, haue any place holy vnder Heauen, this is that place. This place we exempt from all other vses, and consecrate to God: Heere, we meete to acknowledge his diuine presence, so often as we come together in his name, and we testifie the same by our most solemne and royall assemblies. For if wee consider our selues, as grafted in Christ, and members of one bodie: heere we come as sheepe into ourspirituall fold, all linked and combined in the same prayers, with one heart
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:1702:43"/>
and voyce praysing and lauding the name of God. And if we consider our communion with the Saints, and Angels of God, and the Church triumphant which is in Heauen: heere we ioyne and meete to glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie the same God in earth, which the Angels doe in Heauen: which diuine and celestiall company, how can we better represent, then in this spirituall randi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouze, singing: <hi>Holy, holy, holy, Lord God of Sabbath: Heauen and earth are full of the maiesty of thy glory? &amp;c.</hi> Thirdly, if the zeale of our profession moue: heere we professe and testifie the name of God, the right worship, and the truth of our calling, against Turkes, Iewes, Infidels, Sects, Aduersaries, Men, Diuels, and all the enemies of Gods truth, sounding and ringing out our zeale for the prayse and glory of God, that all the world may heere it. And lastly, if the loue of our Lord Iesus Christ compell vs: heere wee assembled, are so oft assured of <note n="a" place="margin">Mat. 18. 20.</note> his presence as we come toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in his name: and when all other places are sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to abuse; our high wayes and fields to riflings and robberies; our Markets and Streets to quarrellings, to deceiuings; our common meetings to wrongfull and fraudulent dealings; our Courts to strife and janglings; whereas disorders are seene daily in our houses, and our secret Chambers can tell of our vncleannesse: the reuerence of this place confoundeth lewd sinners, and keepeth it at least from all open prophanation and abuse. But where is our zeale if it be not in our Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, nay, if it be against them? Had God holinesse which he might bestow vpon this place, and is he so bare of it that now he hath none left. Did hee spend all vpon mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> and hath he neuer a blessing left for our <hi>Herebs?</hi> Yes, some of that was bestowed vpon <hi>Salomons</hi> Temple: wherefore CHRIST was euen eaten vp with the zeale of that house: Which <note place="margin">b Iohn 2. 17.</note>
               <pb n="79" facs="tcp:1702:43"/>
howsoeuer it were shortly to be prophaned and made desolate, yet was it <note n="c" place="margin">Ius 19. 76.</note> holy to Christ as long as it stood. But our deuotions are gone out of Gods house, to our owne houses, we decke and beautifie them, because we loue our selues as we would Gods house if we lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued God. God hath long agoe complayned of this. <hi>Is it time to build to your selues seeled houses,</hi> 
               <note n="d" place="margin">Hag. 1. 4.</note> 
               <hi>and let my house lie wasle?</hi> Which being so, no maruell that the same vilenesse and contempt which we haue suffered to fall vpon our Churches and Church orders, is now fallen vpon our selues: I speake not this to grace cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, or outward behauiours of Religion, otherwise then shadowes to that body: shadowes they are to the body of Religion, but such as well become the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. Onely this I protest, if holinesse be gone out of the toes and feete of our Church, yet let vs keepe it in the heart still. And if wee haue forgotten the place in which we stand, let vs not forget the person before whom we stand, which is God the Lord, the high owner of Heauen &amp; Earth; which is neere to vs how euer we are farre from him; which doth enspire with his spirit, not onely the head, and honourable parts, but the toes and the feete; to whom the heart is due, and the spirit, and all our strength: But of how many of vs doth he not receiue the calues of our lips? This most high &amp; great God sanctifie vs all in our se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueral standings before him; and grant vs all holy toes, holy feete, holy knees, holy hands, holy lippes, holy hearts to the glory, and prayse of his name, in Christ our Lord: Now to God the Father Almightie, with God the Sonne, and God the holy Ghost, three persons and one God, be rendred all honour, prayse, power, dominion, and glory, now and for euer. So be it.</p>

               <hi>Origen</hi> about the end of his eight booke against <hi>Celsus,</hi> by mistaking this saying of CHRIST, affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth that it is not lawfull for Christians to warre, to beare office, to exercise iudgement. <hi>Iulian</hi> the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stata, because CHRIST forbiddeth to resist euill, most falsely slandereth the Christians, as enemies to Lawes, and Officers, and commonwealthes: taking the sword from the Magistrate, and arming euery priuate man to wrong and iniustice. <hi>Valusianus,</hi> otherwise an
<pb facs="tcp:1702:45"/>
excellent man, proposeth this doubt, out of this place; to Saint <hi>Augustine, epistola quinta:</hi> asking how this doctrine can stand with lawes and iustice, which for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bideth to resist euill? There Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> answereth, that in its selfe nature, it is not euill to resist, but hee which resisteth not, doth better, as hauing more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. The <hi>Manichees</hi> did heerevpon reiect all the old Testament, because it commaunded reuenge, which the new forbiddeth: to whom Saint <hi>Aug. lib. contra Faust.</hi> 22. <hi>cap.</hi> 76. saith, that there is a dispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of things, and a distribution of times; and in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of these, according to diuersities of times, Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts or Councels may be eyther abrogated or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted. Whence the Schoolemen haue their ground, which affirme, that Christ spake not this as a generall commandement for all to obey; but a speciall coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell for some which are more perfect. <hi>Hugo Cardinalis</hi> was of opinion, that the commandement was tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, and for the <hi>Apostles</hi> onely, which were to builde the Church in their bloud: now if it were of force, it would hurt the Church. And lastly the Anabaptists out of their lewd construction of this place doe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne all politique lawes, and ciuill gouernment; for which causes we must be more diligent in search of the right interpretation.</p>

               <hi>Aristotle</hi> setteth downe the justice of <hi>Rhadamanthus</hi> in this Verse:

               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Now if wee vnderstand not these words out of the causes which they were spoken, as Saint <hi>Hilary</hi> noteth, it may seeme that Christ spake against this Law: first, saying, <hi>You heard it said to them of old time:</hi> And then, <hi>I say to you.</hi> But Christ said before, <hi>Verse</hi> 17. <hi>Thinke not I am come to destroy the Law.</hi> Neither doth the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spell take away Authority from Rulers and Gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, or meddle with politique or iudiciall Lawes, as hee protesteth, saying, <note n="x" place="margin">Iohn 18. 36.</note> 
               <hi>My Kingdome is not of this world.</hi> And for an vndoubted Argument, Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> which heard this Sermon, and receiuing the Holy Ghost, had the sence of all <note n="y" place="margin">Luke 24. 45.</note> Scriptures opned, expresly sheweth, that publique reuenge by the Magistrate, is not by Gods word prohibited, when he saith, <note n="z" place="margin">Ephes. 2. 14.</note> 
               <hi>That Gouernours are sent of God, for the punishment of such as doe euill.</hi> And Saint <hi>Paul</hi> (which receiued the vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of Scriptures by immediate gift of the Holy Ghost) <hi>There</hi>

               <hi>is no power but of God: whosoeuer resisteth the power, resisteth the ordinance of God, Verse</hi> 4. <note n="b" place="margin">Rom. 13. 2. 3.</note> 
               <hi>For he beareth not the Sword for nought: for he is the minister of God.</hi> So wee haue it most plaine, that publique ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance is not heere prohibited, nor the temporall powers restrained.</p>
            <p>Why then saith Christ, <hi>resist not euill?</hi> He frameth this interpretation, not against the words of the Law, but against the false Glosse of the Pharisies, to purge it, as it were, of that wicked Leauen. For this they taught, because Gods word did not onely permit, but command the Magistrate, to render euill for euill;
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:1702:46"/>
therefore euery priuate man was allowed to doe the like, and reuenge euery injury done to him, so he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded not this Rule. But see what the Pharisies brought on the people, by corrupt teaching: For their resisting the Magistrate, gaue occasion to the vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ruine of their state. See <hi>Iosephus de bello Iudaico lib.</hi> 2. <hi>Cap. primo.</hi> For an Eagle, taken from the Porch of the Temple, what slaughter <hi>Archelaus</hi> souldiers made of three thousand Iewes, in a tumult.

            <p>Well then, Christ giuing the Magistrate authoritie; to priuate persons saith, <hi>Resist not euill:</hi> And heere we <note place="margin">

            </p>
            <p>Secondly, that it may appeare, that Christ intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not the abolition of the Law of old, or maketh <note place="margin">2.</note> any new, but onely giueth the old her naturall and proper sence, <hi>Moses</hi> himselfe, when hee set downe to the Magistrate a law of Reuenge, to priuate men saith; <hi>Thou</hi>

               <hi>Say not, I will doe to him as hee hath done to mee: I will reward him according as hee hath deserued.</hi> And in the third of the <hi>Threues,</hi> the very forme of suffering is set downe; <note n="f" place="margin">La<gap reason="illegible" extent="1+ letters">

               <pb n="86" facs="tcp:1702:47"/>
Thirdly, for further clearing the sence, wee must note to whom our Lord speaketh: For hee doth not instruct the Magistrates or rulers in their duty, which were not present to his Sermon: For hee speaketh to his Disciples, and the people which had no authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and singling them out, <hi rend="sup">a</hi> 
               <hi>Vobis dico; I say to you.</hi> So the Disciples and the multitude, which beare no office, <note place="margin">

                  </gap> 6. 27.</note> are forbidden to reuenge priuate injury offered.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Christs Disciples, and the multitude, did dreame of an externall and politicall kingdome of the <note place="margin">4</note> Messiah, which should be armed with externall and kingly power and authority, and vanquish their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies: but CHRIST here foretelleth that they must looke for no such thing, no such bodily Sauiour, but rather prepare themselues to suffer smitings on the cheekes, and spoyle of goods, and bitter injuries and reproach. Neyther should-they receiue assistance of the Magistrates themselues, <note n="b" place="margin">Psal. 47. vlt.</note> which <hi>are called the Shieldes of the earth,</hi> but rather haue layd vpon their backes, by them also, most grieuous and heauy bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens.</p>
            <p>Fiftly and lastly, CHRIST setteth downe heere the forme of his kingdome, which is spirituall and <note place="margin">5.</note> heauenly; For to the eies of the world his kingdome appeareth not. <hi>If</hi>

<pb n="87" facs="tcp:1702:47"/>
I cannot forbeare to speake, whether the Pharises peruerted with falser glossing the law of <hi>Moses,</hi> or our aduersaries the words of Christ. Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> from whom the Pope challengeth his high Supremacie, could not finde exemption from the Magistrate, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed him out of these words of Christ, but was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented to be vnder authoritatiue correction of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then rulers, so were all the Apostles; but <hi>Peters</hi> suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors haue shaken off all authority of Christian Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates. I pray you, of what Scripture sauoreth this Stile, <hi>To be iudged of none?</hi> Well, let vs graunt the Pope this liberty, to be free of all soueraignty tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall; and sithence it must needs so be, let all the sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen Priests haue immunity from all Secular power. And not onely challenge this prerogatiue, when the Magistrate may seeme to offer them injustice and wrong; but in cases in which themselues stand guilty of most notorious crimes. But whence hath he lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to be aboue all authoritie? Nay, who gaue the Beast with the great Horne power to push Kings out of their Thrones, to depose the Magistrate, to stop the ordinary course of Iustice, to maintaine the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects in disobedience, to assoyle them of their oathes of allegeance? and how was it found an act meritori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to murder kings? a point of highest godlines to lay wicked hands vpon the annoynted ministers of God? If there be any light in the word of God, if any truth <note n="e" place="margin">Iohn 1. 4.</note> in the truth: hence may we know that man of sinne which is an aduersary, and exalteth himselfe <note n="f" place="margin">2 Thes. <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

               <hi>aboue all that is God,</hi> For if the Magistrates be Gods on earth, as Christ himselfe saith, and shall be shewed: the Pope extolling himselfe aboue all Authority of earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Princes, aduanceth himselfe aboue all that is God on earth. And if Christ be the King of Heauen, which flatly denyeth his kingdome to be of this world: The

Pope by joyning to the spirituall the temporall sword: exalteth himselfe <hi>aboue all that is God in Heauen,</hi> Well, I I leaue you to consider further. This I dare say, hee will take no blowes on the cheeke.</p>
            <p>For our present matter in hand, wee stand by these assured, that the Magistrates authority is warranted by God; and to this end, to punish the doers of euill: and therefore it is lawfull by authority of Gods word, for any that is wronged, to seeke that ordinance for redresse: onely we are forbidden to auenge our selues. Therefore the <note n="k" place="margin">Luke 18.</note> Widow did not offend, which sought the injust Iudge. Now priuate reuengings draw friends on both sides, and parties and confederacies; and so the resisting of the euill is a cause to spread it further: But when the Magistrate punisheth, no man taketh part, no man resisteth, no man is offended: onely the euill is taken away; and the Delinquent, by exemplary justice done, made a terrour to all offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours.</p>
            <p>But you will say, <note n="l" place="margin">Rom. 12. 18.</note> 
               <hi>Vengeance is mine (saith the Lord.)</hi> True. But God himselfe saith, <hi>That they which</hi> 
               <note n="m" place="margin">Psal. 82. 6.</note> 
               <hi>beare rule are Gods:</hi> And Christ himselfe <note n="n" place="margin">Iohn 10. 35.</note> so interprets that Scripture. Therefore when they strike, God striketh: when they <note n="o" place="margin">Rom 13 2. &amp; 4.</note> kill, God killeth: they haue his Sword: they haue his Ordinance: they haue his Seate: they haue a speciall <note n="p" place="margin">Psal. 82. 6.</note> name; they haue a speciall <note n="q" place="margin">1 Sa. 15. 1. 3</note> annoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from him. Therefore they are free from offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (when they <note n="r" place="margin">Deut. 1. 16.</note> kill offendours or euill doers) of that Law, which saith, <hi>Thou shalt not kill.</hi> And that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement of not resisting euill, bindeth not them: nay rather, they highly sinne against God if they resist it not.</p>
            <p>We haue it then most euident what Christ intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, when he saith, <hi>Resist not euill.</hi> For when wee haue receiued wrongs, and are destitute of helpe from
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:1702:48"/>
the Magistrate, then ought wee not to auenge our selues, and by priuate resistance requite euill with euill; but to compose our selues to meekenesse and patience, in forbearing; to forgiue our enemies; and not onely to temper from all outward force, but to quench all inward and inordinate heate, burning to reuenge. We must keepe the peace of Christ, either by publique resisting, or priuate forbearing. And ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther suffer the losse of our liues, than to haue the sweet fruit of quiet patience destroyed in vs. If spit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, smitings, woundings, killings, might shake our hope, or take away the comforts of Gods spirit, who could be Christs Disciples? We may keepe GODS peace in warre; no tumult, no fire or sword of our e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies can take it from vs. For him wee serue, for sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing our soules, and for an euerlasting deliuerance: And shall we forsake him for an houres paine, and a blow on our cheekes? Hee that striketh our shadow, toucheth not our body: And hee that killeth the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, toucheth not the soule. Must the followers of Christ goe to Heauen by a common way? Shall those constant Patients, which are in the diet of Saluation, feare taking some bitternesse in their potion, or let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a little bloud? They write that <hi>Archimedes</hi> had his mind so fixed on a few Mathematicall lines which he drew in the dust, that hee attended not while the Citty was fired about his eares. But how many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands of professours of Christ can wee name, whose Faith hath beene so fixed in God, that they haue des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pised the cruell siege and battery which the enemies of CHRIST haue laid to their flesh and bloud? But because this Doctrine soundeth vnreasonable to eares of flesh and bloud: and in cases where wee haue no lawfull meanes of assistance, to beare and ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come with meekenesse and patience, all bitter inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:1702:49"/>
It is a hard kinde of striuing, and a stranger vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory: let vs prepare our selues to this.</p>
            <p>First, let vs consider, that when we suffer injury, it <note place="margin">1</note> is not by chance, or by the vnbrideled lust of our Aduersaries, but of the goodwill of God, permitting it so to be; eyther to punish our sinnes, or to encrease our Faith, or to exercise our patience, whereas wee are assured that our haires of <note n="a" place="margin">Luc. 12. 7. Luc. 21. 18.</note> our heads are numbred, and we shall not loose one of them.</p>
            <p>Secondly, let vs interpret these sent, from GODS <note place="margin">2</note> loue: For <hi>such suffered</hi> 
               <note n="b" place="margin">Mat. 5. 12.</note> 
               <hi>all the Saints,</hi> all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, and CHRIST the Sonne of GOD, and all his Apostles. <hi>He</hi> 
               <note n="c" place="margin">Psal 74. 5. 6.</note> 
               <hi>that hewed timber out of the wood, was knowne to bring it to an excellent piece of worke.</hi> So was <hi>Ioseph</hi> hewed in the Stockes, and in the Prison; God brought him to an excellent piece of worke, to make him Lord of Aegypt: so was Iesus Christ hew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and squared on the Crosse, with Hammers and Nayles, and Speares: of this excellent worke: see where hee sitteth at Gods right hand, <note n="d" place="margin">Ephes. 74. 5. 6</note> Thrones, Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, Dominations, Angells, subjected to him.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, let not our eyes be onely vpon the atro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of the injury offered. But consider we how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <note place="margin">3</note> wayes wee our selues haue offended GOD and our Neighbours: for which wee may justly suffer. So the Emperour <hi>Mauritius,</hi> when <hi>Phocas</hi> slew most cruelly, before his face, his Wife, and his fiue Children, speaking not one word to the enemy, no not in such a bitter wrong; but considering his owne sinnes, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued still crying, till the Sword sundered his head from his body: <hi>Iustus es Domine, &amp; iusta iudicia tua: Thou art righteous (O Lord) and iust are thy iudgements.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, let vs consider that wee our selues daily <note place="margin">4</note> aske forgiuenesse for talent sinnes, as I may call them. For the least <note n="e" place="margin">Mat. 18. 32.</note> 
               <hi>sinne</hi> wee haue committed against the
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:1702:49"/>
Diuine Maiestie, infinitely excelleth the greatest tres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe our brother can doe vs. Why then should not we forgiue our brother peny-farthing offences? <note n="a" place="margin">Col. 3. 12. 1<gap reason="illegible" extent="1+ letters">

               <hi>Put on meekenesse, gentlenesse, patience, suffering one another, forgiuing one another, euen as Christ hath forgiuen you.</hi> 
               <note place="margin">5</note>
            </p>
            <p>Fiftly, see how Saint <hi>Paul</hi> dehorteth from reuenge: <hi>Mine is</hi> 
               <note n="b" place="margin">Rom. 12. 5.</note> 
               <hi>vengeance, I will recompence; saith the Lord;</hi> which being so, wee doe not hurt our enemies by taking the Sword out of GODS hand, which will not suffer the wicked to be vnpunished; but we draw downe vengeance, and deriue the course of his Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice which he aymed at our enemies, vpon our owne heads.</p>
            <p>Sixtly, let vs consider, that it is not Reuenge, but Long-suffering, Meekenesse, Gentlenesse, which can <note place="margin">6</note> doe vs good: <note n="c" place="margin">Mat. 5. 5.</note> 
               <hi>The meeke shall inherit the earth.</hi> So <hi>Dauid,</hi> when <hi>Shimei</hi> rayled on him. <hi>Smite, suffer him, perhaps</hi>

               <hi>God will looke vpon mee, and render me good, for the euill hee hath done mee this day.</hi> It is a notable Sentence of Saint <hi>Pauls,</hi> 
               <note n="e" place="margin">1 Tim. 4. 8.</note> 
               <hi>Godlinesse is profitable to all things, which hath the promise of this life, and of the life to come.</hi> For the vngodly and disobedient to this Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spell, which follow their owne lusts, and breake out by impatience into actions of Reuenge; these are they that ruinate their Families, which tease on the hatreds and wickednesses of other men to their owne destructions: these waste themselues, and their friends, and their goods, by eager strife and dissenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: these fall from honour and high estate, when the meeke and patient, besides their hope of future blessednesse with God in Heauen, doe heere on earth liue in all peace and quietnesse: Their names conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue, their houses stand, their posterity encreaseth, they keepe their leafe and greenenesse, like the trees planted by the waters side: when they see of their
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:1702:50"/>
enemies; the Roote and Stocke consumed.</p>
            <p>But my seauenth and last reason, which ought to moue vs against our owne impatience, to meekenes <note place="margin">7</note> and sufferance, I take from Christs words; <hi>to him I say:</hi> What better, what greater reason, can we haue? Doe not Princes command their subjects hard and terrible things, which yet they obey? as the Prince of the <hi>Moschouites,</hi> and the great Duke of <hi>Litarauia,</hi> will command their Nobles to ride downe from a steepe Rocke, and precipitate themselues into the Sea? Doe not Leaders and Generalls of Armies, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the Souldiers to fight, where is no possibilitie of being saued? <note n="z" place="margin">2 Sam. 11. 15.</note> as <hi>Ioab</hi> did <hi>Vriah.</hi> Doe not Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters set their Seruants to hard taskes, and enjoyne them vile and base seruices, which they durst not gainesay? Doe not Fathers put their Children to the Schoole, where they are vnder hard Tutours, and beare stripes, and are restrayned of their will and libertie? Behold heere the LORD of Lords, the KING of Kings, whose rule is ouer all, whose Kingdome hath no end; he which is able to restore vs a thousand fold, hee which will crowne our wrongs, and glorifie our sufferings: hee commandeth that we suffer the euils of men with patience, which of vs shall presume to lift vp his owne sinfull lust aboue the diuine commaundement? Heere our Captayne and <note n="a" place="margin">Heb. 6. 20.</note> forerunner Christ sendeth vs into an hard fight, but most honourable: to be the first that shall beat downe sinne and rebellion in our owne hearts: to captiuate our owne will: to vanquish our owne reason: Are we not his Souldiers, is not our life a spirituall warfare? fight we not all vnder his banner? When we entred the Sacrament of our calling, when we tooke oath a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the world, and the Diuell, was the flesh left out? Heere our Lord <note n="b" place="margin">Iohn. 13. 13.</note> and Master (for so we call him, and
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:1702:50"/>
so he is) enioyneth vs a vile worke, as may seeme, but indeede it is but as <hi>Hercules,</hi> to beat downe monsters; as burning Wrath, pale Enuy, cankred Malice, and by throwing out sinne, to cleanse that Augias stable of our hearts. Be the action what it may, it as our ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to doe what our Master commandeth. <note n="c" place="margin">Gen. 22. 1.</note>

               <hi>grieuous for the time:</hi> yet it bringeth with it most excellent fruit. And thus we haue the sense of the Scripture cleared from doubt, and the reasons set downe, which may mooue vs to patience, and obedience to what we are commanded: I haue shewed also that the authority of the Magistrate, contrary to that which was obiected out of diuers Authors, is not onely heere no wayes impeached, but rather confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and maintayned.</p>
            <p>Now because many which seeme not to meddle with priuate reuenge, doe cloake their malice vnder the lawfull vse of lawes and Magistrates; let vs see in a few words in what cases the helpe of the ordinance is iustly, and according to the rule of Gods word, law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully implored.</p>
            <p>This is the first, when we vse the arme of publique authority, that he which hath done euill, may be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished, for his amendment.</p>
            <p>Next, that the offendour being thus chastened, may cease from doing the like iniury to others.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="94" facs="tcp:1702:51"/>
Then, that we our selues may, through benefit of the: <note place="margin">3</note> publique redresse, liue quietly.</p>
            <p>Againe, to the terrour of others, whose vnbrid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lednesse <note place="margin">4</note> may by Iustice, thus exemplined, be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strayned.</p>
            <p>Fiftly, for very naturall loue to Equity and Iustice, which requireth by Gods owne ordinance, that euill <note place="margin">5</note> doers may be punished, that it may appeare there is a God that iudgeth the earth.</p>
            <p>And lastly, for the common quieting of the weale-publique, and the Church of God, that refractaries <note place="margin">6</note> and malefactors may be cut off, like contagious parts, which corrupt the rest of the bodie; when they rancle and fester, and grow incurable.</p>

Who can gainesay vs? we haue the law on our side, we doe it by the aduise of our learned counsell: And doe we not perceiue that we are in the snare of the Diuell? where is thy counsell, now O Christ? who careth for thy words? we which are thus affected, how farre are we from turning the other cheeke?</p>
            <p>And let this suffice for leading our vnderstanding in the right sense of this Scripture, and for that which is spoken by Christ of wrong in generall; <hi>Resist not euill.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hauing deliuered the generall rule, our Sauiour sets downe three distinct kindes of iniury.</p>
            <p>The first of iniuries which may be done to vs in our body or person <hi>If a man shall smite thee on thy cheeke.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The second in our goods or fortunes. <hi>If a man shall take away thy Cloake.</hi>

            <p>We know beloued in those which prepare them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues to patience and forbearing, when they shal come to feeling, and the iniury shall pinch their shoulders, and binde them and spoyle them, or make a dint in their flesh: It will bite shrewdly, and few can endure it: but I haue deliuered those rules and reasons, which should carry vs in these occurrents, and the substance of that which is included in these particular instances of wrong, hath beene shewed in the generall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position.</p>

which shall most injustly handle and persecute them. For by the Magistrates, all that professed Iesus Christ were smitten, spoyled of their goods; banished most cruelly, tormented and killed, by Kings; by Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernours, by Deputies, Lieutenants, Iudges; by Edicts, Proclamations, Lawes, Decrees, Counfailes; all vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iust and cruell things were done to the Martyres of Christ. We see how needfull it was for the Church that Christ should say, <hi>vobis dico,</hi> to you I speake; for they that cannot keepe this saying, cannot be Christs Disciples. If now then brethren we haue Christian Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates which shield vs from wrong, yet let vs learne this lesson, if God should put vs vnder Antichristian authority which may doe vs wrong, and still consider, that albeit we are now in Sanctuary, in a peaceable state, in a quiet and protected Church: yet we haue taken vpon vs that profession which must not stinch or shrinke, when highest iniustice, and extreamest vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation shall be inflicted.

And although the law doe not speake of his Priesthood; of his anointing with the holy Ghost, of his Passion, of his Baptisme, of his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocencie, &amp;c. yet it doth shadow him in signes and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens:

Because they were both ioynt-promisers of Christ: the law in dumbe shewes; the Prophets by speaking. 3. Because they ended in one, being as shall be shewed, both fulfilled in Christ; and heere I will take them both for one, namely, for those fiue Bookes of <hi>Moses,</hi> which the Iewes call <hi>Torach,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the question which is of the Ceremonies of the law, and their practise, is there more of purpose and principally set downe; and the law hauing in it impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citly the Prophets, which were her interpreters, may stand for both. But howsoeuer the law be to be taken; by it selfe without the Prophets: and if by it selfe, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther iudiciall, or ceremoniall, or morrall: of Christ it is true, <hi>I came not to destroy the law.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Christ himselfe saith, <hi>I came not to take away the law.</hi> If the Law could speake, it would say, I was not giuen to take away Christ. But <hi>Lex soluit Christum,</hi> the law tooke away Christ, when he was crucified, and died, and was buried: for to these, he was <note n="p" place="margin">Luc. 24. 26.</note> a debter by the law: And Christ tooke away the law, when by his death it was expired and ceased. I, but Christ by thus dying, hath attayned to his fulnesse of power and glory, and spread his saluation ouer all the world: And the law by thus ceasing hath her fulnesse, to haue her perfection and consummation of all that was sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified and written. If then the law were Christs end, why should not Christ be the end of the Law? If he obayed the law, and was vnder it, why should not the
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:1702:56"/>
law obey Christ, and be vnder him? Thus then are these words to be vnderstood; <hi>I came not to destroy the law,</hi> that is, to make it voyd, or of none effect. But take this <hi>soluere</hi> in any sense, whether of omitting any thing, which was contayned in the Law, or commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting any thing which was contrary to the law: for as it is all one <note n="q" place="margin">Iac. 2. <gap reason="illegible" extent="1+ letters">

And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Christ in the words next following, will haue all the Law fulfilled to the least iot, or tittle, and point. <hi>Till heauen and earth passe away, one iot or tittle of the Law shall not scape, till all be fulfilled.</hi> And now, little should we beleeue of Christ, if we should not beleeue this. Many which came before Christ, did breake the Law: I, all from our Father <hi>Adam</hi> were transgressours of the Law, yet none were euer sent, or came into the world to this end. If then the end of Christs com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming had beene to loose the Law, needes must Christ in his comming haue had a worser end then any that were before him. <hi>Nolite putare:</hi> God forbid we should so thinke.</p>

               <hi>charta,</hi> the great commandement. The Law of Ceremonies was a Law of iots and titles, compared. The iudiciall Law, was middle betweene both: by which the Kings did go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:1702:57"/>
the State: yet so that the Kings did punish those which offended against the Law morall, as well in breaches of the first Table, as of the second: as you may see the first Booke of Kings, <hi>cap.</hi> 15, <hi>vers.</hi> 13. <hi>Where</hi> Asa <hi>put downe his mother</hi> Maachah <hi>from her estate, because she had made an Idoll in a Groue, and burnt her Idols.</hi> Now if the Ceremonies were violated, it did belong to <note n="x" place="margin">Deut. 17. 8.</note> the Priests to iudge that: and therefore they stood most stifly &amp; prefractly for the vpholding of this Law, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they were Masters of the ceremonies themselues.

When the multitude laid to the blessed <hi>Protomartyr</hi> S. <hi>Stephens</hi> charge: <hi>We haue heard</hi> (Stephen) <hi>say, that this Iesus of Nazareth shall destroy this place, and change the ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Now albeit, as I haue shewed, they accused Christ of breaking the other two: yet their onely feare was, that he would alter their customes and ceremonies. To this Christ answereth, <hi>nolite putare;</hi> thinke not so.</p>
            <p>Christ did not transgresse the morall law: for hee destroyed and abolished sinne. <note n="d" place="margin">1 Ioh. 3. 8.</note> 
               <hi>Hee did loose the worke of the diuell.</hi> Sinne was the diuels <note n="e" place="margin">Gen. 3.</note> worke, the law be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing broken, gaue sin strength: as <note n="f" place="margin">1 Cor. 15.</note> S. <hi>Paul, the strength of sinne is the law.</hi> Then was the diuels worke strong and sure: <hi>but Christ by fulfilling the law, hath loosed the worke of the diuell.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Neither did Christ take away the iudiciall law: for it tooke him away, and <note n="g" place="margin">Ioh. 19. 1.</note> hee confessed hee was vnder it. So he answered to the full, both morall and iudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall law: the law morall by his righteousnesse; the law

iudiciall with his bloud. Nay, the law of Ceremonies which was of least moment, and shortest time, he did not disobey; for he was circumcised, and presented in the Temple; and did not onely become vnder the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies himselfe; but commanded others to do <note n="h" place="margin">Math. <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

And lastly, for the fulfilling of the Prophets, it doth appeare, not onely by his birth; by his life, by his doctrine, miracles, death and passion; but by this very slaunder, they here put vpon him, in accounting him an enemie to the law and Prophets. This a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet fore-told: That he should be <note n="k" place="margin">Isa. 5<gap reason="illegible" extent="1+ letters">

As then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Christs comming, the law and the Prophets, did intentiuely looke towards him; so Christ being come, doth fixe his eyes on them, making them the end of his comming. And so Christ comes; and being come, the end of the law and Prophets is come; without whose comming the law had beene ridiculous, and the Prophets friuolous, for they had had no end. God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid that we should thinke that God which made no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in vaine, should make vaine his owne ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; that the Prophets which spake by his owne spirit,

should haue proued lyars: which yet had so beene if Christ Iesus comming in our flesh, had not fulfilled the contents of both Law and Prophets.</p>
            <p>But the question is, how Christ fulfilled the law, when by his death and the oblation of himself, he caused all the ceremonies and sacrifices to cease. For S. <hi>Paul</hi> sa<gap reason="illegible" extent="1+ letters">

For the law when it stood vnfulfilled, was in her whole strength and vertue: but now by Christ his death, the law is made voyd and of none effect. Then the lawes demaund hath beene fully satisfied. Now euery obligation doth witnesse against it selfe, that when the condition is performed, it is voyd, though it it be not actually cancelled: it mattereth not then though Christ did not actually naile the law of ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances to the Crosse: this was enough to disanull the lawes whole vertue and power, when to all the lawes demaund, hee made in himselfe full tender vpon the Crosse, before so many witnesses, God, and Angels, and Men.

This Scripture then refuteth the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of Sciences, to which men are by nature most propense and prone, and for all Arts, Sciences, Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, Wisedome, commendeth to vs one, which is the Art of a Christian, to know the true and liuing God.

If we know God but little, we can loue him but a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle; the more we know him, the more we loue him: if we know him not at all, we cannot at all loue him. It is rooted in the nature of all things to desire that which is good; and whosoe<gap reason="illegible" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>er desireth the good, doth not rest his desire in any subordinate good: for the desire will striue and presse forward for the soueraigne good, that good to which all other goodnesse is sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate; neither can it haue rest, till it haue attayned to this supreame end of all things, Now albeit many desire the good apparant; for the supreame good: yet the desire in the false, entendeth the true good: as we see in the heathen people, which worshipping false Gods, did entend in them the worship of the true and onely God. It is another principle in nature, for euery thing which hath life to desire and doe all that it can to keepe it selfe from dying: for if our life should pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish, what could the good of life profit vs? for no good, no not the soueraigne good, could any wayes aduantage him, that held by no tenure of life to enioy it. Here then wee haue the supreame good made ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest to our vnderstanding; which good is the true
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:1702:64"/>
God: and to a good eternall, wee haue a life propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, which is eternall, that wee may neuer dye to our good, nor our good to vs.</p>
            <p>You shall not then expect that I speake of this Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture by way of diuision: sithence the subiect of my Text is the true and perfect Vnion: for other Sciences wee learne; first, by learning the parts, and then the whole. This Science wee haue first by being taught the whole, (the mysterie of the Trinity) and then in it all the parts of a Christian life. It is all one know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge for all to know: one life for all to seeke: one God for all to beleeue in: and there is but one way to come to this life, which is by knowing the true and onely God.</p>
            <p>I haue heard of a dangerous harbour in our Seas, at whose mouth, at <hi>Goodwins</hi> sands, out of which the Pilot cannot make forth, but hee must sinke in those sands, vnlesse he so steere his Ship that he bring two steeples which stand off, so euen in his sight that they may seeme to be but one. Doubtlesse wee cannot make way in our faith, without sinking into endlesse errour, vnlesse wee beleeue God the Father, and God the Sonne, to be the same in substance, and the onely true God. But is not the holy Ghost with the Father and the Sonne, one substance, and the same true and liuing God? yes: but he is our Pilot to guide vs in this way: Therefore the Scripture saith, <note n="c" place="margin">Rom. 8. 4.</note>

               <hi>Euery man that hath heard and learned of my Father, commeth to me.</hi> And <note n="k" place="margin">Vers. 65.</note> 
               <hi>no man can come to mee, except it be giuen him of my Father.</hi> For this is that <hi>clarification</hi> of which our Sauiour spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth in the first verse: <hi>Father, clarifie thy Sonne, so doth the Sonne glorifie the Father,</hi> verse 4. and the holy Ghost, which proceedeth from the Father and the Sonne, clarifie both the Father and the Sonne; that all three persons may be glorified of vs all, and that nothing may be more cleare &amp; illustrious to our faith, then this summe and ground of all truth: <hi>The Trinitie in Vnitie, and Vnitie in Trinitie, is to be worshipped.</hi> So hence we may ascertaine our consciences, that as the Father, the Son, and the holy Ghost are one God: so our faith, which beleeueth, <hi>is one faith:</hi> our <note n="l" place="margin">Eph. 4. 5.</note> knowledge which appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hendeth this mysterie, is one knowledge: that is, with the same obtute of faith, I beleeue in God the Father, with the same and no other, I beleeue in GOD the Sonne, and God the holy Ghost: And with the same light of knowledge, I know one, I know all three: Neither doth this Vnion rest here, to make our <hi>faith</hi> one, and our knowledge one, but to make the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers one; for which our Lord prayed, <hi>That</hi> 
               <note n="m" place="margin">Ioh. 17. 21. 22.</note> 
               <hi>all which shall beleeue in Christ</hi> (through the Gospell preached by his Apostles) <hi>may be one, as the Father is in Christ, and Christ in the Father, that they also may be one in vs.</hi> 
               <note n="n" place="margin">Vers. 23.</note> 
               <hi>I in them, and thou in mee, that they may be made perfect in one.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This then we must take for certaine, that in reading this Scripture, we must of necessitie vnderstand God the holy Ghost, with God the Father, and God the
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:1702:65"/>
Sonne, as S. <hi>Augustine</hi> teacheth: <hi>Ordo verborum est vt cum patre et filio consequenter spiritum sanctum intelliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus, quia &amp;c?</hi> The order of the words is, saith hee, that by consequence wee must vnderstand the holy Ghost with the Father and the Sonne: for the spirit is the substantiall, and consubstantiall charity of both the Father and the Sonne: because the Father and the Sonne are not two Gods: neither are the Father, the Sonne, and the holy Ghost three Gods, but the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie it selfe is one God. Neither is the Father the same (person) that the Sonne, nor the Sonne the same that the Father is, nor the holy Ghost the same that the Father and the Sonne: whereas the Father, the Sonne, and the Spirit are three, and this very Trinitie is one God.</p>
            <p>Wee haue then by the grace of Christ, in these words, <hi>A Catechisme, or Enchiridion</hi> for a Christian man: contayning in it all the mysteries of saluation, all the articles of our faith. For at that very instant, that wee beleeue God to be the Father, maker of the world, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, the onely true and liuing God: wee beleeue the incarnation of Iesus Christ, we beleeue in the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghost, the resurrection from the dead, the remissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of sinnes, we beleeue the holy Catholique Church, the communion of Saints, and whatsoeuer is written in the law and the Prophets; all the contents of the Gospell. This one knowledge hath all knowledge in it: for as life in that instant that it is life, giueth spirit, motion, seeing, tasting, feeling, and desire to preserue life: so as soone as we haue this knowledge, wee haue with it all heauenly wisedome, and vnderstanding, we need not be perswaded to beleeue the Scriptures, wee haue the light, the feeling, the tast of heauenly things: and as the light of this Sunne, which directeth my go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in one place, shineth to mee in all places, in the
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:1702:65"/>
house, in the field, in the Sea, in the Desart, and in all deepe places: so the light of the knowledge of God and Iesus Christ, lightneth to mee all things that were in darknesse, leadeth me out of all doubts and errours, and illuminateth all things that are in heauen and earth.</p>
            <p>But that you mistake me not, I doe not deny when we haue receiued this faith, but that we haue our far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther growing in Christ, and encrease in godlinesse, by hearing and reading the word, by meditation, by pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, by receiuing our daily bread and drinke of life, in the Sacraments, by walking, by motion, by exercise and labouring in our most holy faith. The thing I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, is to shew, that all these spring from this foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, and moue from the power of this life. For our bodily life cannot consist or continue without daily foode: therefore it is naturall to life to hunger for it daily, and by foode wee receiue strength, and in our strength we trauaile, and labour, and doe the things which belong to this life. This then is my purpose, to shew that all heauenly gifts and powers of the spirit, are of the nature of faith. So the Apostle, <note n="o" place="margin">Rom. 5. 2.</note> 
               <hi>By faith we haue an entrance into this grace wherein we stand.</hi> But first wee liue by faith: <hi>The iust shall liue by</hi>

               <hi>the word of faith, which wee preach.</hi> And this word must be mixed with <hi>faith,</hi> and be as meat digested in the sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack of our soules.

               <note n="f" place="margin">1 Ioh. 5. 4.</note> 
               <hi>which ouercommeth the world, euen your faith.</hi> See how S. <hi>Paul</hi> ascribeth to faith, all the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, labours, workes, striuings, assurance, hope, and the victories of the Saints, in the whole Chapter, which is the eleuenth to the Hebrewes.</p>
            <p>But here the Scripture speaketh of knowledge, not <note place="margin">Quest.</note> of faith.</p>
            <p>No: it cannot vnderstand this knowledge with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <note place="margin">Answ.</note> the light of faith: For our knowledge of God is the issue and birth of our faith. In all earthly things knowledge maketh faith, for all the wise men of this world beleeued no farther then they were led by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son: but of heauenly things faith maketh the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; for these are aboue reason, and captiue our vnderstanding: Therefore Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> 
               <note n="g" place="margin">Heb. 11. 3.</note> 
               <hi>By faith wee vnderstand, &amp;c.</hi> And Saint <hi>Peter, I beleeue and know that thou art Christ, the Sonne</hi>

               <hi>of the liuing GOD.</hi> Therefore our faith hath her perfection in this life, and knowledge doth surrender to faith heere: In the world to come, faith shall surrender to know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and faith shall bee no more. Wee beleeue not heere in part, wee <note n="i" place="margin">1 Cor. 13. 9.</note> know but in part now; but wee beleeue <note n="k" place="margin">1 Cor 13. 7.</note> all things.

            <p>My first I take from that principle of Nature, in which there is in all men, a desire, and appetite ingenite and inly rooted of the soueraigne good: <hi>Omnia appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunt borum:</hi> for when to this desire ingrafted, the good desired shall be manifestly obiected out of the vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, conuicted by euidence of the light of Gods word: how quickly will the desire assent and rest sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied? For now she is filled, and at the end of her ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite, and cannot possibly desire farther. If then the straying and erroneous desire of Heathen people, in ignorance after the true God; being misled in the blindnesse of their vnderstanding, did like men, which being almost drowned in vnperfectnesse and amazement of their sense, will catch at stickes and stones, and weeds in the bottome of the water, and hold them fast to death; thinking by these to get out<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> so they hoping to seeke euasion from eternall death, in that deezinesse, and confusion of apprehension, did

How much more shall we be perswaded and euicted by euidence of faith, and enlightned in our vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standings from God himselfe, hold by him: So hold all that beleeue. The Apostle hauing caught hold heere, will not loose his hold for any creature in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen or <note n="f" place="margin">Rom. 8. 35.</note> earth, or life, or death: saying; <hi>What shall se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate vs from the loue of Christ?</hi> and hauing summed vp all other good or euill, that may be imagined, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in the last verse, that none of these <hi>shall be able to separate vs from the loue of God in which is, Iesus Christ.</hi> By this good, see how fast holy <hi>Iob</hi> holdeth, <hi>Though he</hi>

            <p>A third argument I draw from the manner of teaching of the holy Ghost, which is our Teacher (as shall be shewed in the last place) of this knowledge of the Father and the Sonne, and maketh euery Scholar perfect in this mistery in the twinckling of an eye.

            </p>
            <p>But you will obiect, the Apostles had the gift of that knowledge by miracle, and those gifts were extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary, and now they cease: euery man that will haue knowledge now, must eyther learne of others, or seeke it in his booke.</p>
            <p>I deny not, but that those gifts which are <hi>gratis data,</hi> giuen freely, and not <hi>gratum facientia,</hi> as is the distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Schoole-men, not iustifying, or making a man acceptable to God, (of which sort were the gifts of tongues, and vnderstanding all Scriptures:) I say I doe not deny, but they are ceased, and were giuen onely to the Apostles and Ministers, and some others, by imposition of the Apostles hands, in the primitiue Church: for these are not giuen them which receiue them for their owne saluation, but for the saluation of others: and we haue the vse and collation, and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of the same gifts, being by their preaching brought to the knowledge of God: but this I say; the gift of faith which is giuen vs, by which we are inwardly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate and know God, though it be ordinary, and shall be euer in Gods Church to the end of the world; yet is it of higher power, and greater miracle: for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation of euery Soule that is grafted in Christ, speaketh as much to the prayse of Gods power and glory, as the creation of heauen and earth made of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,

and this is wrought in vs, by which wee are made the sonnes of God in the same instant, as was that knowledge extraordinary, and by God: immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately, and by Gods free gift, and in all that are saued alike, absolutely necessary for all that are saued.</p>

            <p>But I will yet labour to set you surer vpon this foundation. When <hi>Peter</hi>

I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech you then consider with me the malice and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty of the diuell. For when he saw the ground-worke, and foundation laid, on which all which shall be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, must be built for euer, and that very same foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation planted to tri<gap reason="illegible" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="138" facs="tcp:1702:73"/>
argument and wit of man, it is held for the ground of all truth: What, that <hi>Peter</hi> was a rocke? that we deny not; but that he was the rocke, this rocke, vpon which Christ his Church is built. And so wee haue, for <hi>tu es Christus, tu es Petrus.</hi> But the Pope of Rome is <hi>Peters</hi> successour: <hi>Ergo,</hi> Christs Church is built vpon the Pope. But the Church shall preuaile: <hi>Ergo,</hi> the Pope cannot erre. But the Popes seat is Rome, therefore <hi>Romana</hi> is <hi>Catholica.</hi> But none shall be saued, but they which are of the Church, therefore, <hi>this is eternall life, to be of the Church of Rome.</hi> Doe you not see how wee are disputed out of our saluation; how wee haue lost our faith, as it were at a tricke of fast and loose? How cunningly the Diuell hath iugled away our founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? Doe you not see this blessed Scripture, our For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tresse, our Rocke, our Castle, our high Tower: which was lifted vp, and planted against hell, and hell gates, turned to fortifie for hell, and hell gates? Doe you not see how lightly we are parted from this one article, the ground and summe of all truth, which the blessed and glorious Apostles held deerer then their lifes blood? And as if we had receiued no good at all by the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God and Christ; we make onely earnest of faith, and stand with vtmost contention and eager<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, whether Images be to be worshipped, whether the dead be to be prayed for, whether the Pope can dispense with Oathes? &amp;c. Doe you not see how we are robbed of our euidence, and turned out of our right Patrimonie of the Scriptures, and so vtterly dispossest, that our way is turned into a maze, or wood; and our truth into a lye, and our life into death? If then you haue not learned sufficiently the surenesse of this ground, the deerenesse of this knowledge, from the light of the Scriptures, the words of Christ, from the faith of the Prophets, Apostles, Martyrs, Saints; yet
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:1702:73"/>
wee may sufficiently be perswaded from the cruelty, malice, and opposition, and raging of the Diuell: which from the beginning hath neuer ceased from seeking the vndermining, batterie, and ouerthrow of this truth.</p>
            <p>I will now draw to my conclusion, and come to ourselues: which hauing quitted this article from the slaunders of our enemies, haue not yet turned it for our owne best vse. This is the faith which we haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued; this is our ground; this we professe; in this we were baptized: and yet hungry after knowledge, as if wee had not beene sufficiently taught, wee long for newes out of Scriptures; we must haue the word more curiously carued: some will haue this Preacher, some that: and this is fuller, and this is sweeter, and this is deeper, and wee will haue I know not what. Let mee be bold to say; you heare Sermons, as you heare Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicke, for some delightfull straine, or quirke of mens wit: you itch in your eares, and must haue them tickled daily with new pleasure: your fashion is, to iudge of the learning, and sufficiencie of the Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher, which should be here humbled, and learne to examine, and iudge, and condemne your selues.</p>
            <p>What then? Either doe those things which you haue beleeued, or else confesse against your selues, that you haue not beleeued at all. For Christ is the end of our faith, which is the beginning of a godly life. We that haue heard Christ preached, are beyond hearing, and are come to doing. This then remayneth: Loue one another; frequent diuine Prayers; visite the sicke; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue the poore; receive the Sacraments; auoid con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions; lay aside idle questions; haue peace and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord one with another; giue glory to God. It is not hard to know what to doe, but to doe what we know. Wee may learne that in one Sermon, which all our
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:1702:74"/>
life is not enough to put in practise. They which ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered <note n="c" place="margin">E<gap reason="illegible" extent="1+ letters">

VVhy doest thouseeke far Why search for hidden thinges? this one Homer full, I beleeue in God, and him whom he hath sent, Iesus Christ; is able to sustaine thy soule to eternall life. In this thou hast the substance &amp; sweetnesse of all, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer lyeth eyther hidden, or scattred in the volume of the Scriptures. The whole Scrptures are Manna, but that which feedeth my soule to life eternall is this faith in Christ: As then he that had filled his Homer full, had beene ridiculously absurd to thinke he should want, because he saw so much lye scattered in the mountaynes, and in the plaine fields: so should we be dangerously deceiued, if we should not thinke that the knowledge of God the Father, and his Sonne, were sufficient for vs to eternall life: because there are so many things contayned in the holy writ, which our vnderstandings haue not gathered.
