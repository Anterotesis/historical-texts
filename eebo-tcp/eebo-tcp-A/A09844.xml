            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Ponthus gaue hy<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> grete strokes where he myght hyt hym. So he meruaylled moche how he myght endure ayenst hym so longe. Soo they brake theyr sheldes / &amp; theyr helmes / &amp; they were so wery at the fyrst assaute that they must nedes reste theym / &amp; to take theyr bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thes / &amp; they lened vpon theyr swerdes for werynesse. And than Androwe spake fyrst &amp; sayd.

caste hym downe and fell bothe to the erth / but Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thus fell vpon hym soo y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Androwe myght not ryse / &amp; Ponthus sayd vnto hy<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.

Syr knyght yelde you to the fayre gentylwoman I praye you and that there be no more debate bytwene you and me / for we haue preued vs ynough togyder. And than Androwe knewe well the grete courtosye of the knyght whiche that he faught with / &amp; sayd vnto hym / to her shall I yelde me gladly syth that it pleaseth you. It suffyseth me sayd Ponthus / &amp; than he rose vp ryght wery / and moche trauayled of the grete strokes and of the grete batayll that had so longe endured / soo he came to his hors with moche payne &amp; lepte vp and wente in to the forest where he sawe the thyckest soo faste that euery man loste the syght of hym. And Geffrey de lesygnen &amp; many other came to Androwe &amp; asked how he dyde &amp; he sayd well after the disease that he hadde / but that he had fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de his mayster. A sayd Geffrey fayre fren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de we shall go you &amp; I togyder to the ryght fayre lady &amp; we shall yelde vs to her mercy.

So wente they on the thyrde daye after to yelde theym to fayre Sydoyne.

            <p>SO the olde gentylwoman / &amp; the dwarfe came out of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> pauylyon &amp; had a bowe turkoys and her foure arowes as ye haue herde before / &amp; the here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myte with the vyser ledde her by the brydell / and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de her sygne to whiche she sholde shote as at for that moneth. And the olde gentylwoman smote fyrst in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> shelde of Thybault de bloys / the whiche was named for a good knyght. And the other arowe in the shelde of damp Martyne. The thyrde arowe in the shelde of Henry de mou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t maurency / and the fourth arowe was in the shelde of Roberte de resyllyon. These were the foure knyghtes moost named of whome that the shel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des of theyr armes were hanged vp / &amp; whan she had shote her foure arowes she withdrewe her to the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uylyon. And anone after the blacke knyght came out armed with all his armes / his shelde aboute his necke the spere in his hande. And on the other syde came in Thybault the erle of mortayne ryght rychely arayed with grete foyson of trumpettes and taboures. And as soone as eche of theym sawe other / they lette theyr horses renne and gaue grete strokes. But Ponthus reuersed so the erle that he hadde almoost beten hym downe vnto the grounde. So they sette hande vpon theyr swerdes / and eche of them ranne vpon an other ryght rudely / but Ponthus smote so myghty strokes and so harde that he kerued a two all that euer he hyt the Erle defended hym to his power. Soo endured the batayll ryghte longe / but Ponthus whiche was grete and stronge toke hym by the helme and drewe

And than abode in his coyfet of yren on whiche he gaue hym a grete stroke sayenge vnto hym that he sholde yelde hym / but he smote hym not with the cuttynge. And the erle endured moche but nedes he muste yelde hym whyther he wolde or not. Soo he badde hym yelde hym to the fayrest lady of Brytayne So he departed &amp; wente in to the forest as he dyde be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore. And the erle wente &amp; yelde hym vnto fayre Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doyne as the other knyghtes dyde whiche dyde hym grete worshyp / and so dyde her fader the kynge. The nexte tuesdaye faught Tybault de bloys / &amp; soo all the other tyll the yeres ende after folowynge. But it were to longe taryenge to tell the Iustes and the bataylles that euery man dyde in that moneth &amp; in all the other monethes &amp; in all the other monethes folowynge / for there were many fayre Iustes &amp; grete bataylles / and many noble dedes of armes / the whiche sholde be to longe for to tell who that wolde rehers theym all. But the ende was that they were all ouercome in armes / and sente in to the pryson of fayre Sydoyne. So they were two &amp; fyfty knyghtes prysoners of the best that men myght fynde in ony londes for to conquere wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shyp. Euery man herde &amp; sawe that the good knygh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes wente to assaye themselfe / &amp; that he chose alwaye the best that men myght fynde to do dedes of armes Euery man desyred for to be of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> nombre for to assaye them ayenst hym.

In good fayth sayd quene Sydoyne we haue vytayll ynoughe for a moneth or more / &amp; in the meane tyme god shall helpe vs and sende vs rescowes.

Soo he set good watche &amp; wardes aboute the toure that there sholde no vytayll come to them / &amp; than he bethought hym of a grete malyce / for he came to the kynge &amp; prayed hym that he wolde go to his doughter for he woteth well y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he sholde tourne her of her foly that she hath taken in honde / and tolde hym that he wolde not famysshe her but fall to a trety The kynge was good &amp; trewe &amp; thought none harme but wente to his doughter &amp; tolde her how she was in waye to be deed &amp; shewed her many ensamples.

Soo I shall rather dye but yf I knowe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> very trouth. In good fayth sayd the kynge it may well be as ye saye / for I knowe no man of knowlege that hath ben there and harde it is where as none escapeth.

Soo helpe me god sayd the kynge I may not spede / for she is yet all sorowfull and angry for her lorde / wherfore I may haue no good answere. No sayd Guenelet by

the holy fayth ye shall abyde with her and bere her fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawshyp for to ete pesen &amp; plommes / for ye shall bothe two dye for honger or I shall haue her.

Foure dayes or fyue they had mete ynoughe but at the syxte day theyr vytaylles fayled them / for them had neyther brede nor flesshe.

Fayre doughter I wote neuer how we may be auysed nor what counseyll I may gyue you so mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che sorowe I haue / but for to se you dye I may not suf<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fre it.

Whan she sawe that she muste nedes do it for to saue her fader more than for her owne deth that she recked not of / she sayd that syth it is so she shall do her wyll.

The kynge rose vp &amp; spake to Guenelet and she wed hym that by strength he sholde neuer gete y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> loue of her / &amp; that he wolde leue his enterpryse &amp; he sholde gyue hym townes &amp; castelles or what thynge y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he wol<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>de haue.
