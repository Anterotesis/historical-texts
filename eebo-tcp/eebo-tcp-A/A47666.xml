            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>And as there is nothing of our <hi>English Growth</hi> to be compared to it, so I do not think our Soil or Climate are capable of producing a Commodity of the like Goodness; nor can <hi>France</hi> it self, or those more

Southern Nations, which pretend to carry away the Glory of Wit and Judgment from these Northern Kingdoms, Boast of any Production of this Kind that Approacheth, much less Equaleth it.

                  <p>I Know not but this Enterprise I have undertaken, of passing from <hi>Poetry</hi> to <hi>History,</hi> may be accused of Presumption or Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:42879:8"/>
to the <hi>Muses.</hi> They may say I have done enough to follow <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi> and <hi>Virgil,</hi> without endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring after <hi>Thucydides</hi> and <hi>Livy</hi>: And that <hi>Heroick Poetry</hi> being the greatest Effort of <hi>Wit,</hi> and the just Measure of Humane Life, I might have spared my self the <hi>Fatigue</hi> of a second Carreer, and reposed where the two greatest Men of the World have sate down. They may yet add, That having been hitherto well treated by the <hi>Muses,</hi> I ought to have been Faithful to the end<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and not occasion'd them the Grief of seeing themselves abandon'd by me, after so many Graces receiv'd from them.</p>
                  <p>I confess the <hi>Race</hi> of <hi>Poets</hi> and that of <hi>Historians</hi> are different; an<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> that not one having ever yet at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to change, I ought to fear hazarding my self first in the Journey. Nevertheless having with Care discovered the Passage, I have neither found it so Long, nor so Painful, as many imagine not knowing the Country, but by ill
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:42879:8"/>
                     <hi>Maps,</hi> and false Representations made of it. There are no Forts to take, no Rocks nor Precipices to go over; the descent is almost Insensible by which you may pass from one to the other.</p>
                  <p>'Tis true no body has hitherto udertaken it; and to speak <hi>Poeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally</hi> when we are treating of <hi>Prose, Homer, Virgil</hi> and <hi>Tasso,</hi> satisfied with the first Rank they hold on this side of <hi>Parnassus,</hi> either had not leasure, or would not give themselves the trouble of crossing over to that of the <hi>Historians.</hi> And what I say of those, may be said of <hi>Thucydides, Tacitus</hi> and <hi>Livy,</hi> &amp;c. who have abstained through Weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, or other Considerations.</p>
                  <p>I find enough of leasure to ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture upon it, and I owe this lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure partly to my <hi>Condition,</hi> that places me in an equal distance from doing nothing, or nothing to the purpose; and partly to my <hi>Consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution,</hi> that Nourishes it self by Labour, and is Enlightned by Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as the Fire and Stars. And
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:42879:9"/>
what I say of Leasure arising from Labour is not strange, seeing those that work continually lengthen and multiply their Days; and by the same reason, according to <hi>Seneca,</hi> the Idle shorten and diminish their Number. And it happens to me in this, as to those that make of a well manag'd <hi>Mediocrity,</hi> an unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caying <hi>Fund</hi>; in the place that the bad employ of <hi>Abundance,</hi> is a cause of Perpetual <hi>Want</hi> to the Rich Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digals.</p>
                  <p>As to my Infidelity to the Muses<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 'tis not so great as those may ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine that are Ignorant. <hi>History</hi> is <hi>one</hi> of them, the most <hi>Noble,</hi> and I believe the <hi>oldest</hi> of all the <hi>Troop.</hi> Not only because <hi>Fable</hi> succeeded <hi>Truth,</hi> and <hi>Musick Speech</hi>; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the World was acquainted with <hi>Histories</hi> before <hi>Poems;</hi> and <hi>Homer</hi>'s <hi>Iliads,</hi> as every Body knows, are only a <hi>Copy</hi> in <hi>Verse,</hi> made of what <hi>Datis</hi> and <hi>Dictis</hi> have written in <hi>Prose</hi> of the <hi>Wars</hi> of <hi>Troy.</hi> I may add, That Antiquity having given the Names of the <hi>Nine Muses</hi>
                     <pb n="5" facs="tcp:42879:9"/>
to the Books of <hi>Herodotus, History</hi> was willing by that to make the World understand, that <hi>History</hi> was of the same <hi>Family</hi>; or that the <hi>Muses</hi> labour not less with the <hi>Historians</hi> than the <hi>Poets.</hi> And <hi>Dion. Halicar.</hi> says, That of all the <hi>Muses,</hi> there is not one that resembles that of <hi>Homer</hi>'s, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches nearer than that of <hi>Hero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotus.</hi> A great deal more may be said for my change. <hi>History,</hi> if we believe <hi>Cicero,</hi> is but a <hi>Poem</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Slavery of <hi>Dress,</hi> without Ceremony and Constraint. The <hi>Poetick Muse</hi> has therefore no reason to complain of my Inconstancy, or to esteem me Disloyal, if I serve her in her days of Liberty, after having serv'd her in her days of Confinement.</p>
                  <p>It may likewise be said with Confidence, upon the resemblance remarked by the <hi>Criticks</hi> between <hi>History</hi> and <hi>Poetry,</hi> that a Man must be a <hi>Poet</hi> to be an <hi>Historian.</hi> I do not say <hi>Historian</hi> after the manner of the Makers of <hi>Legends</hi>

After those this Fertile Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther produced great Bodies indeed, but rude and unformed.

                  <p>IF we may credit St. <hi>Jerom, France</hi> has always been renown'd for its Eloquence: And notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Shame, it must be said, That amongst so much <hi>Eloquence,</hi> and so many <hi>Learned Men,</hi> it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not to this time boast of one <hi>regular Historian</hi>: I don't say in <hi>Latin,</hi> but in the <hi>French Language.</hi> And I make this distinction, because the <hi>French</hi> that have written in <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin,</hi> have in some manner estranged themselves from their own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. This without Prejudice to the Memory of Monsieur <hi>de Thou,</hi> whose Reputation is rather founded upon the <hi>Bulk,</hi> than <hi>Merit</hi> of his Work. And since we are like to have suddenly a <hi>Latin History</hi> of
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:42879:13"/>
Monsieur <hi>de la Barda,</hi> our <hi>Salust</hi> or <hi>Tacitus,</hi> it will be lawful for him to adapt himself to which he pleases, perhaps both may be desirous of him, and no doubt but he will do Honour to the one or the other. But I return to my Proposition, That to this time we have not had one <hi>Historian</hi> in <hi>our Language,</hi> that could be esteem'd perfect. We have been very <hi>Prolifick</hi> in <hi>Journals, Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zettes</hi> and <hi>Memoirs</hi>: We are stored with enough to make an Illustrious Library, where you will see no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Dukes, Peers, Mares<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chals of <hi>France,</hi> and Generals of Armies, bound in Spanish Skins, and rang'd upon Shelves of Cedar.</p>
                  <p>But if the <hi>Commentaries</hi> of <hi>Caesar,</hi> which are so <hi>Polite,</hi> so <hi>Advised,</hi> so <hi>Modest,</hi> cannot obtain for him the name of an <hi>Historian,</hi> can we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that <hi>Beleagnangis, Montluc,</hi> the Duke <hi>de Nevers,</hi> the Sieurs <hi>Castel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neau, de Tavannes,</hi> or <hi>Suille,</hi> have any Right to pretend to it, under the Title of their <hi>Memoirs.</hi> I would willingly place by themselves those
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:42879:14"/>
attributed to the Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi> and Monsieur the Duke of <hi>Roche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foucault,</hi> because few Essentials are wanting to the Form of a Regular History. But notwithstanding they have writ with so much Judgment, and so good Language, with those Defects they cannot take it ill we do not violate a Rule that we have not yet intrench'd upon to serve the <hi>first Caesar,</hi> who was at least as gallant a Man as them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</p>
                  <p>There remains but <hi>Philip Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines,</hi> and it may be said I ought not to treat him with greater Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gor than <hi>Justus Lipsius</hi> has done, who has given him so honourable a place amongst the <hi>Historians</hi> very near <hi>Polybius.</hi> 'Tis very true that <hi>Commines</hi> has great Dispositions to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards an <hi>Historian</hi> of the first Rank: He is Sincere, Judicious, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structive: His Reflections, Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences, Instructions, and Digressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, come from a finish'd Wisdom, and perfect Politick; but having had no other <hi>Master</hi> than his own

                     <hi>Genius</hi>; no other Rule, no other Models than his own Judgment; he could mount no higher at most, than an Essay or rough Draught of History. But yet this Essay receives Admission into the Cabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets of wife Princes, above all that Art and Nature has there amassed of Rich and Curious.</p>
                  <p>Upon this Retrenchment of <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storians,</hi> what will become of our <hi>Historiographers</hi>; And what will be the Rank and Employ given them by <hi>Boccalin</hi> in his Kingdom of <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nassus?

                  <p>THis Rarity then of a True <hi>History</hi> and Perfect <hi>Historian,</hi> proceeds either from length of Time, that so great a Work re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires, or from the excellent Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities in the Workman to succeed in his Design.

As for the Ancients, <hi>Paul Emilius</hi> spent Thirty Years in composing what he has left us; and <hi>Paulus Jovius</hi> Thirty seven in his; and yet nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther one nor the other of any great bulk. And 'twill not be wondred at by those that know <hi>Virgil</hi> was Twelve Years in finishing what may be read in so many Hours. But in such things 'tis not the <hi>Mass,</hi> but the <hi>Judgment</hi> and <hi>Wit</hi> that cost the Pains.

                  <p>As to the Qualities necessary for an Historian; <hi>Lucian</hi> would have him have a Prudence begun by

But <hi>Lucian</hi> requires too much; for besides that ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily, the Action requires one thing, and the Composition another: That Experience that makes the <hi>Wise,</hi> makes them not always <hi>Eloquent</hi>; and that 'tis Extraordinary to find a <hi>good Soldier</hi> a Man of his <hi>Pen,</hi> who receives without Caution what his Prince or General says of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.

Matters than those of the Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blick. And we never read that <hi>Livy</hi> was ever Counsellor to <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustus</hi> with <hi>Maecenas,</hi> or Captain with <hi>Agrippa.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If the Necessity of writing <hi>Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Action,</hi> obliged an <hi>Historian</hi> to be a <hi>Man</hi> of the <hi>Sword,</hi> the same Obligation would lie upon the <hi>Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakers</hi> of an <hi>Heroick Poem,</hi> who are so full of Combats in their Heads, and which they transfer upon Paper.

                  <p>BEing a <hi>Soldier</hi> then is as little necessary for an <hi>Historian</hi> as for a <hi>Poet</hi>; but to be either, 'tis necessary to be a Man of <hi>Wit.

With this <hi>Lucullus,</hi> after he had laid aside the long Robe, became a great Captain.

                     <pb n="21" facs="tcp:42879:17"/>An Historian must then have <hi>Wit,</hi> but not a <hi>Wit</hi> of no larger Extension than a Song or Elegy. I say an unbounded Spirit, that raises it self above Crowns and Crown'd Heads; that comprehends States and Empires; that is Popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar in a Republick, Monarchick in a Monarchy; that has receiv'd of Nature, at least in Disposition and unpolish'd, all the Forms of Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks. With one Ray of this Spirit, without having steer'd the Helm, he is able to represent the Good and Evil Forms of Government; the Faults and Vertues of Ministers, without having had part with them; and without being call'd to the Councils of Princes, without being found amongst their Troops, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though of a Profession estranged from Courts and Armies, he is able to instruct Princes and Generals for the time to come, by the Examples of times past.</p>
                  <p>All this is said with Submission to Cardinal <hi>Bentivoglio,</hi> and with respect to his Purple and Merit.

Some think it not strange the <hi>Cardinal Historian</hi> meeting the <hi>Jesuit</hi> in the same <hi>Carreer,</hi> Emula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion should draw from his Pen some strokes, not altogether so Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous for his Competitor. But I am not of their Opinion, as think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it enough to look for Jealousie amongst Artisans and Shop-keepers, without a Supposition of finding it in the Cabinets of Learned Men. However it was, to say nothing of <hi>Plato</hi> and <hi>Aristotle</hi> who had nothing to do with Government, and yet have writ so well of a <hi>Commonwealth</hi>; according to this new <hi>Maxim</hi> of the <hi>Cardinal's,</hi> the Institution of a Prince composed by St. <hi>Thomas,</hi> so estrang'd from a <hi>Court</hi> both by his Profession and manner of Life, must be then a kind of Madness: And <hi>Justus

Lipsius</hi> that lived in the World with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out having to do with it, yet in his Learned Works has abridg'd all that appertains to the Knowledge of it, has left us only a lasting Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surdity. Let us know then that a good Wit and good Judgment, aided by Reading and Meditation, without a Bishoprick or Office in the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> of a simple Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious, may make an excellent Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tician: And why not after having made of Cardinal <hi>Bentivoglio</hi> a <hi>Warring Historian,</hi> notwithstanding his long Robe and Priesthood. The distance is not greater between a <hi>Religious</hi> and a <hi>Politick,</hi> than a Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal and a Captain.

<pb n="25" facs="tcp:42879:19"/>
very Foundations; and discover all the Mysteries of Affairs.</p>
                  <p>This is a great deal, and yet there is more; the <hi>Spirit</hi> required for an <hi>Historian</hi> (to leave nothing unsaid) must not be of those <hi>Wits</hi> that one may compare to the Rich Covetous, that keep all upon their Register and in their Coffers; or of those hoarse Musicians, that as one of the Ancients says, Sing only to themselves and their Muse: He must not only be Rich within, with his Notions and Thoughts; his Riches must appear, and Eloquence give Eclate and Magnificence to his words.</p>
                  <p>If <hi>History</hi> was shut up in a Mans Breast, and consisted, according to the Opinion of <hi>Vossius,</hi> but in the simple Memory of things, there would be neither occasion for Words or Writing: And a <hi>Barbarian</hi> that had the use of no Language, might proceed <hi>Historian,</hi> by the sole Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Affairs passed in his time. <hi>History,</hi> as I have said, is of the
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:42879:20"/>
                     <hi>Family</hi> of the Muses, where there is nothing <hi>Hoarse</hi> or <hi>Mute:</hi> Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony and Eloquence reign amongst them, as in the Waters of Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains and Leaves of Trees. 'Tis then necessary that an Historian should be <hi>Eloquent</hi> either <hi>Naturally</hi> or by <hi>Study,</hi> and hereafter I will shew what ought to be the <hi>Character</hi> of his <hi>Eloquence.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>These interior <hi>Faculties</hi> proper to an <hi>Historian,</hi> must be supported from without, to the end, in the School-mens <hi>Dialect,</hi> they may pas<gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> from Power to Act: And because his <hi>Office</hi> is <hi>Reporter</hi> and <hi>Witness,</hi> it were to be wish'd it might be from his own <hi>View</hi>; but since Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture cannot permit a Man to live twice, or more than in one Age, it must at least be prop'd by the <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony</hi> of those that have <hi>seen</hi> the things they recount; or have <hi>learn'd</hi> them from those People that have lived in that time; where these Aids are wanting, he must have recourse to <hi>Relations</hi> and <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moirs,</hi>
                     <pb n="27" facs="tcp:42879:20"/>
which hold the place of <hi>Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses,</hi> but those well chose, Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, Authorised, and free from Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality.</p>
                  <p>But if <hi>History</hi> be a Work of so great Weight, and so Difficult? If so many <hi>Qualities</hi> are necessary in an <hi>Historian,</hi> to come off with Success; What shall I return to those that may demand if I find these Qualifications in my self? To which <hi>first</hi> I answer, Till this time I have had no occasion to enquire; and if I have found any of them, I ought to put them in use. And <hi>Secondly,</hi> In the Picture I have drawn, I have not represented my self such as I am, but such as I ought to be. That this is the <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trait</hi> of an <hi>Historian</hi> that has never yet been, nor will not arrive but with the perfect Prince, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Captain, the World has waited for so many Ages.

                  </p>
                  <p>In this consists the principal <hi>End</hi> of <hi>History,</hi> and ought to be the first <hi>Design</hi> of an Historian. He
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:42879:22"/>
must leave to the Inventors of <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances,</hi> those Paper-Combatants, to Amuse the Idle Youth with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentations of feigned Wars and imagined Loves. Kings, Princes, Emperors, Ministers of State, and Generals, are to be his <hi>Spectators</hi>; and the <hi>Scenes</hi> must be adapted to the Presence. And since <hi>History</hi> is a <hi>Philosophy</hi> purified from the <hi>Pedantry</hi> of the <hi>Schools,</hi> free from the Embarrasments of Divisions and Arguments, and reduced into Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Example; his Office is to <hi>represent</hi> his <hi>Matter</hi> founded upon <hi>Truth</hi>; to <hi>conduct</hi> their <hi>Will</hi> by their <hi>Memory</hi>; to <hi>reform</hi> and render per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect the <hi>Modern</hi> by the <hi>Ancient,</hi> the present by the past. And the Happiness of a People consisting in the good Instructions given those that govern, that ought to be the chief end of his Labour.</p>
                  <p>And for that reason it is, that <hi>History</hi> is called the <hi>Philosophy</hi> of <hi>Princes,</hi> their Governour and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellor in their mature Age, their
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:42879:22"/>
Adviser in their Cabinets and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. For that reason the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror <hi>Basil,</hi> in his Book of Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions to his Son <hi>Leon,</hi> recommends History as a way of <hi>Travelling</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>Fatigue</hi>; as an advanced Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, as an easie way to enrich himself by the Labours of others; to instruct and form himself by the Examples as well of the Bad as the Good; to recall back past Ages, and to extend his Life to the <hi>beginning</hi> by his <hi>Memory.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But let us not esteem <hi>History</hi> only as a <hi>Counsellor</hi> to Kings and Princes; she is also their <hi>Judge</hi> not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding the Sovereignty of which they so much boast them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. And as she has <hi>Theatres</hi> and <hi>Thrones,</hi> where she <hi>Crowns</hi> the <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous</hi>; she has likewise <hi>Scaffolds</hi> and <hi>Wheels,</hi> where the <hi>Vicious suffer</hi> the <hi>Punishment</hi> due to their <hi>Crimes</hi> in the Eyes of all People to all Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity.

Memories exposed, their Ghosts torn in pieces, produce at least this Good after so many Ills, they make others fear the like Torment, whose evil Genius has thrown upon the like Conduct.</p>
                  <p>And here let us not forget the Remark made by <hi>Tacitus,</hi> that <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story</hi> is of great use, if it were but for shewing the <hi>Rod</hi> to <hi>Tyrants,</hi> and advertising them of the Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment she prepares.

                  <p>Let us not then perswade our selves, the Advantages that accrue from <hi>History,</hi> are Fruits of a bitter or insipid Nature: The most deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Tables of Antiquity, whether those of <hi>Cleopatra</hi> or <hi>Apicius,</hi> where whole Provinces and Patrimonies were eaten in <hi>Ragousts</hi>; or those of <hi>Nero,</hi> prepared by the most Ingenious and most finished De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauches, in a Court the most loose and Luxurious the World ever knew, had nothing so Delicious as the <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles</hi> of <hi>History.</hi> We see not there the <hi>Gladiators</hi> Combating and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filing the Meats with their Blood, for the Divertisement of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany; but the Combats of Vertue and Fortune: Victories obtain'd by Patience and Prudence, over

Sufferings and Dangers.

                  <p>AFter so many things of the <hi>Merit</hi> of <hi>History,</hi> and <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities</hi> of an <hi>Historian</hi>; something must be said of the <hi>Disposition</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired in the Readers. And some would have them of a Maturity above the Flower of their Age, founded upon what <hi>Aristotle</hi> says, Not to admit Youth to the Study of Civil Sciences: But either they
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:42879:29"/>
take him in a wrong Sence, or place his words where they don't belong.</p>
                  <p>'Tis true that <hi>Civil Science</hi> and <hi>History</hi> tend both equally to <hi>Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,</hi> which is the common In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of one and the other: But the ways to arrive at this end are very different; The <hi>one</hi> goes through Definitions, Divisions, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted Discourses, universal Axioms, and Syllogisms in form, which are every way abstracted from Sight, and far from the Paths open to Sense and Imagination. The <hi>other,</hi> without rising to Universals and Ideas, without leaving <hi>Singulars</hi> and <hi>Sensibles,</hi> proceed plainly by <hi>Examples</hi> that lead straight and without by-ways to Use and Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice. I confess, <hi>Youth</hi> accustom'd to things address'd to their Sense and Imagination, enter but with Difficulty into the ways of Science; and if some enter through strength of <hi>Wit,</hi> they find themselves imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately as it were lost in the Country.
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:42879:30"/>
The Lines, the Circles, the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angles, that sustains and guides them in <hi>Geometry</hi> fail them there, they know not where to go, what way to take: But I know nothing can hinder their following the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of <hi>History,</hi> where all is Sensible and Solid; where, without ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing themselves in the <hi>Labyrinth</hi> of <hi>Speculation,</hi> and <hi>Chaos</hi> of <hi>Idea's,</hi> they may learn by what has been done, what to avoid; in which consists the principal Function of Prudence.</p>
                  <p>This in answer to those who do Violence to old <hi>Aristotle,</hi> and force him to their side against his Will. What he has said of <hi>Dogmatical Methods</hi> that are long oblique and embarrassed, cannot be affirmed of <hi>Examples</hi> that are short, straight and clear. And although we grant History may not be so good a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stress of Prudence to <hi>Young People</hi> in general; and that they are not capable of making so good Profit in addressing her as to Philosophy;
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:42879:30"/>
                     <hi>Polybius</hi> and <hi>Livy</hi> would teach them more and lead them further in one day, than the <hi>Expositors</hi> of <hi>Plato</hi> and <hi>Aristotle,</hi> and all the <hi>Disciples</hi> of <hi>Zeno</hi> and <hi>Cleanthes</hi> are able to do in a Month. And three or four such Examples as <hi>Joseph</hi> in Prison, Victorious <hi>Scipio,</hi> and disfigured <hi>Spurina,</hi> would perswade them more of the Merit and Value of <hi>Continence,</hi> than what has ever been said of it in the <hi>Academy</hi> or <hi>Lyceum.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We may see then <hi>Youth</hi> prevents not the Advantages may be made by <hi>History,</hi> if the Maturity of the Judgment supplies the Defect of Years. But the most part of those that apply themselves to this kind of reading, either want the Judgment she requires, or make not use of it as they ought; and that in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fault of knowing what is the <hi>end</hi> of <hi>History,</hi> why she is made pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blick, and of what use in a Civil Life; from whence arrives that in lieu of regarding her as a <hi>School</hi> of
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:42879:31"/>
                     <hi>Vertue,</hi> and <hi>Academy</hi> of <hi>Wisdom,</hi> where there are disinterested <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters</hi> that teach without Wages, without Sallary, who give Lessons night and day to all that under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand to read: The <hi>one</hi> regards her as a <hi>Theatre,</hi> where she repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents sometimes Comical sometimes Tragical Actions: Others as a <hi>Cirque,</hi> where is seen the Coursing of Horses and Clashing of <hi>Gladiators:</hi> Others as a <hi>Fair,</hi> where all sorts of <hi>Antick Statues</hi> and <hi>Pictures</hi> are exposed. And upon the false Judgment all these People make of her, <hi>one</hi> searches Sleep in a quarter of an hours Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course with <hi>Xenophon</hi>; another pleases himself with seeing the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> bleed in the Battel of <hi>Canae,</hi> or that of <hi>Trasymene</hi>; a third, curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous of Rarities esteem'd by Pedants, finds wherewithall to fill his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory with Observations upon the <hi>Serpent-Father</hi> of <hi>Alexander,</hi> the <hi>Wolf-nourisher</hi> of <hi>Romulus,</hi> the <hi>Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Fire</hi> of the Kings of <hi>Persia,</hi> and that of the <hi>Vestal Virgins</hi>; upon the

                     <hi>Head-Dressings</hi> of the <hi>Grecian Dames,</hi> and the <hi>Feet</hi> of the <hi>Romans</hi>; upon the Doves that fed <hi>Semiramis,</hi> and the Viper that stung <hi>Cleopatra</hi>; and a hundred such things that are of no use. And amongst so many that have Libraries full of Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians, there is scarce one endeavours to improve his Honour, or render himself more Vertuous.</p>
                  <p>Let them know then, that <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story</hi> demands another <hi>Disposition</hi> than such People bring with them. And since she is (as the Wise say) the <hi>Directeress</hi> of <hi>Manners,</hi> and <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stress</hi> of <hi>Life,</hi> they must be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded not to lose time with her, to bring another Spirit, other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards, and give another sort of Attention than to a <hi>Comedian.</hi> The first and principle Intention of those that present themselves, must be to be govern'd and conducted by the Examples she proposeth. All the great Men have made this use of her, they regarded her, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to <hi>Plutarch,</hi> as a Looking-glass
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:42879:32"/>
before which they adjusted and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellish'd their Lives by the Vertues of others. And <hi>Cicero</hi> confesses he studied in History the Portraitures of Wise Men who had been before him, to imprint in himself their Resemblance as much as 'twas possible.</p>

                  <p>FRom this general <hi>Intention</hi> of <hi>History,</hi> we must descend to particular Applications. And since <hi>History</hi> is as a Palace or Temple enrich'd with all sorts of Pictures, the Sight must not be cast here and there at random and without design; every one must make choise of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels that he finds proper for his Quality, Age, Temperament, For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune and Affairs.</p>
                  <p>

From others that he sees Confounded, Ashm'd, accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with Infamy, a Vail upon their Faces, followed with Despair, a Poniard in one Hand, a Cord in the other; he may learn to fly Impiety, Covetousness, Luxury, Ravage, Cruelty, and such like Pests that make Tyrannick Reigns, and Tyrants Miserable.</p>
                  <p>A <hi>Statesman</hi> likewise, who sees on one side the Portraiture of <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seph</hi> and <hi>Moses,</hi> opposed to <hi>Achito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phel</hi> and <hi>Haman,</hi> on the other the Pictures of <hi>Agrippa</hi> and <hi>Maecenas,</hi> opposite to <hi>Sejanus</hi> and <hi>Tigillinus,</hi> may draw <hi>Lights</hi> from the one, and <hi>Shadows</hi> from the other, wherewith to imbelish his <hi>Ministry</hi> with a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>interested Fidelity, Religion and

A <hi>General,</hi> a <hi>Soldier,</hi> may there find Models of Military Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, Courage, Moderation and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity; by which they may learn to War as <hi>Men</hi> and not as <hi>Tigers.</hi> The <hi>Ladies</hi> also that will read <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story</hi> with other Lights than the <hi>Fables</hi> of <hi>Ariosto,</hi> and <hi>Tales</hi> of <hi>Ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das,</hi> may furnish themselves with all those Vertues give Grace and Glory to their Sex.</p>
                  <p>A <hi>Greek Sophist</hi> caused a <hi>Note</hi> to be placed over his Door, by which he informed the Publick he had Remedies for all the Troubles of the Mind: The Writing would have been better placed over the Door of <hi>History.</hi> She has indeed Medicaments for all the Griefs and Maladies of the Soul; and when any one approaches with a real Desire of being cured, and not with the vain Curiosity of seeing only, he cannot miss, among such a multitude of Examples, of all sorts, finding a Cenitive or Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rective, be his Ill of what kind so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,

                     <hi>History</hi> performs yet more, she furnishes with Preservatives against all Evils to come, let them arrive on what side they will. And since, as the Wise Man says, nothing is new under the Sun, a Learned and Judicious Reader may learn to foretell the future by the past; and regulate what he has to do, by what has been done; and so become <hi>Diviner</hi> without <hi>Magick,</hi> and <hi>Prophet</hi> without <hi>Inspiration.</hi> There is nothing can arrive, that he will not see afar off; and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst which he will not have time to prepare and arm himself with what is necessary, Prudence or Courage. Also the Wise, Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimous, and all other Vertuous, may improve themselves by the reading of History; but then 'tis necessary this reading, as I have said, be Attentive and Serious, made with Judgment and Design;

                  <p>ALL that I have hitherto said, was necessary for the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of <hi>History,</hi> and to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the Merit to those who daily see her without making Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. 'Tis time, that to give you a more distinct Knowledge of her, I should make a more regular and methodical Picture containing her Matter, Parts and Form. And
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:42879:35"/>
here I will not trouble my self with the Wrangling of <hi>Pedants,</hi> who not knowing how to employ their Excess of Words and Leasure, Dispute among themselves from what Root comes the Word <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story</hi>; one drawing it from a <hi>Greek Word</hi> that signifies to <hi>Recount</hi>; and others from another that signifies to stop the Flood; because <hi>History,</hi> as they say, stops the Flood of things, and gives them Consistance and Durance. I will also dispence with my self (under Favour of the Reader) from entring into the long detail they make of the different sorts of <hi>History,</hi> and content my self to reduce them all into three principal Species, <hi>Divine, Natural</hi> and <hi>Humane. Divine</hi> is that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately inspired by God, as are all those Histories contained in the Bible. <hi>Natural,</hi> such as contain the Works of Nature, as <hi>Aristotle</hi> of <hi>Animals, Theophrastus, Pliny,</hi> and many others. <hi>Humane</hi> treats of Mens Actions; and that by a second
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:42879:35"/>
Dissection, divides it self into five other kinds, <hi>True, Fabulous, Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal, Particular</hi> and <hi>Singular.</hi> The <hi>True</hi> Treats of things received by the common Belief of Men: The <hi>Fabulous,</hi> of such things as are feigned and imagined for the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertisement of the Reader, as what we find in <hi>Poems</hi> and <hi>Romances</hi>: The <hi>Vniversal</hi> has an Extension without Bounds, embraces all Times and Nations; as that of <hi>Diodorus</hi> of <hi>Sicily, Trogus, Justin,</hi> Cardinal <hi>Baronius,</hi> and our Father <hi>Sallian:</hi> The <hi>Particular</hi> is much more confin'd, and contents it self with the Extent of one Nation, as <hi>Livy</hi> and <hi>Tacitus</hi>; or one Reign, as that of <hi>Quintus Curtius:</hi> The <hi>Singular</hi> yet more restrain'd, treats of certain choise Persons that have merited to live more than once, to be seen more than in one Age: And we may place in this Rank the <hi>Cesars</hi> of <hi>Suetonius,</hi> the Famous Lives of <hi>Plutarch,</hi> the Philosophers of <hi>Laertius,</hi> and the Sophists of <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lostratus</hi>:
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:42879:36"/>
And amongst these, not to stay too long in the Times so far off our Age, we may give place to the Collections made by the Sieur <hi>de Brantosme</hi> of Princes and Captains, Princesses and Ladies, that have lived since the Reign of <hi>Francis</hi> the first to his Time.</p>

                     <hi>Vossius,</hi> to whom the Age is obliged for the most accomplish'd Collections of all that appertains to History, has made a <hi>Definition,</hi> that, to speak the Truth, is only a Fantastical Picture of his own Imagination. He cuts off the Tongue and Fingers, takes away the Voice and Pen, and retrenches the Auditors and Readers. In a word, He would neither have her speak or write; that is to say, he has shut her up in the Breast of an Historian, and will only have her a simple Knowledge of parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular things, that ought to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited to the Memory of Men for Instruction to live well. If this <hi>Definition</hi> was Just, she would be no more the great Work, the labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Enterprise, the Burden that makes the greatest Wits give way; and with a moderate Memory it would be as easie to be an <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storian</hi> as to Play at <hi>Picket</hi> or <hi>Tictack.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <pb n="52" facs="tcp:42879:37"/>Besides, a Man without the least Tincture of <hi>Grammar,</hi> or any knowledge of <hi>History,</hi> by the sole Report that may be made him of what she contains, might become all the Historians in a Moment. And if Composition be but as Cloaths to the Body, as <hi>Vossius</hi> says, he may be <hi>Thucydides</hi> and <hi>Tacitus</hi> in Body and Mind, and want nothing of either, but the <hi>Greek Mantle</hi> or <hi>Roman Robe.</hi>

                  <p>LET us then make a <hi>Definition</hi> or <hi>Picture</hi> of <hi>History,</hi> that may be more Natural than that <hi>Vossius</hi> has left us of her: And 'twill not only be more Natural, but Entire and Compleat, if we say, That <hi>History is a continued Narration of
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:42879:38"/>
things True, Great and Publick, writ with Spirit, Eloquence and Judgment; for Instruction to Particulars and Princes, and Good of Civil Society.</hi> The Definition is not of those Slub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber'd pieces, drawn by the <hi>Logicians</hi> at two strokes; 'tis drawn out at length, but has nothing Vain or Superfluous. The Kind, the Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, the Form, and the End of History are there expressed.</p>
                  <p>First, The word <hi>History</hi> is a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerical Term, that is common to all Relations, whether Spoke or Writ, in Prose or in Verse, True or False.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, 'Tis a <hi>continued Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> that has all its Parts fastned together, as those of the Body, or regular Edifice. And by that Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story is distinguish'd from <hi>Annals, Journals</hi> and <hi>Gazettes,</hi> whose Parts not being joyn'd, without Corres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondence, without Union, are only rude Heaps of Materials.</p>
                  <p>In the third place, 'Tis a <hi>Narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Truth,</hi> by which it differs
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:42879:38"/>
from <hi>Heroick Poems</hi> and <hi>Romances,</hi> that are regular Compositions, and demand Unity and Correspondence in all their parts; but through this Defect, all those Edifices, where the Architecture appears so Just, and the Furniture so Rich, are only Imaginary Structures, and Beautiful Castles in the Air.</p>
                  <p>But History requires not only they should be True, but Great and Politick; and by that, in the fourth place, raises it self above <hi>Memoirs</hi> and <hi>Journals,</hi> that enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain with Private and Domestick, and sometimes with Trifles, which Posterity might very well be Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of without Prejudice.</p>
                  <p>In the fifth place, <hi>History</hi> (I speak of the perfect) must be writ with <hi>Spirit, Eloquence</hi> and <hi>Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> All true Histories, from whatever Parts they have come, whether from <hi>Greece</hi> or <hi>Italy,</hi> have this Character, and that distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishes from Legends and Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicles that come out of Religious
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:42879:39"/>
Houses; as likewise from <hi>Memoirs</hi> and <hi>Commentaries</hi> that are happily born in more polish'd places, but want the Warmth of Wit, the Lights of Eloquence, with which the Structure of History must be enlightned; the Ancient Masters have left us this by Tradition: <hi>Cicero</hi> says, A good <hi>Historian</hi> must be a good <hi>Orator: Polybius</hi> affirms, A Narration that barely recounts things done, and teaches not why, how, and for what end, is only fit for Boys that would be amused, and not an History when Men are to be instructed. <hi>Lucian</hi> has said the same after them. And History being a Practical Philosophy, that teaches by Patterns and Examples; and this Method of Teaching being more fine than that of Arguments in form, it therefore demands a greater fineness of Wit, and if their Judgments fail, then whence shall they have the Faculty of discerning Action and Things? Or if they be Dumb or Mute, How shall they
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:42879:39"/>
use the words to perswade Princes, Statesmen and Generals; and of what shall they make Elogies and Crowns for Illustrious Persons, if they are unprovided of <hi>Wit</hi> the <hi>Composer,</hi> and <hi>Eloquence</hi> the <hi>Matter</hi> of them.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Instruction of Particulars and Princes, and the Benefit of Civil So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety</hi> who make Profit by it, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly belongs to History, makes her exterior Form, gives her a better Rank, and renders her far more considerable, than the Fabul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Relations, that do but as Chess and Cards, represent the Adventures of imagined Kings and Queens.</p>

                  <p>HE that does not know <hi>History</hi> by this draught, will never know her by any other: But let us Paint her as we please, the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters are not agreed what <hi>Rank</hi> she ought to hold in the <hi>Family</hi> of the <hi>Muses</hi>: Some place her under <hi>Grammar,</hi> much to her Degrada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to draw her from Courts and Armies, and league her with the Youth and Rubbish of the College. Besides, what Relation is there between the Structure of Speech, and the Publick Happiness, which is the end of the Art of Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story. Others do, for a little more Honour, place her next to <hi>Rheto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick</hi>; but yet between the end of an <hi>Orator,</hi> and that of an <hi>Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian,</hi>
                     <pb n="59" facs="tcp:42879:40"/>
there is such a Difference, that will never permit them to come <gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ogether in any one Point. What Agreement is there betwixt <hi>Truth,</hi> which is the Soul of <hi>History,</hi> and <gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> 
                     <hi>feign'd Likeness,</hi> which is the Form of an <hi>Oration</hi>; and the great Effort of an Orator, who never thinks to come off with better Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess, than when he has cloathed his Fable in the Habit of Truth.</p>
                  <p>There are that have not distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished <hi>Poetry</hi> from <hi>History,</hi> but by the <hi>Cadence</hi> and <hi>Harmony</hi> of <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sification</hi>; as if there has not been <hi>Poems</hi> in <hi>Prose,</hi> and <hi>History</hi> in <hi>Verse. Cicero</hi> himself, who calls <hi>History</hi> a <hi>Free Poem,</hi> and writ the <hi>Actions</hi> of his <hi>Consulship</hi> in <hi>Verse,</hi> did he think that Versification was a Chain to Poetry; or do we find by his being so chain'd, his Sallies have been less Frequent, or his Elevations less Bold.</p>
                  <p>Others have term'd her a <hi>Poem on Foot,</hi> and delighted themselves with the Expression: Those have
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:42879:41"/>
never seen her but in the <hi>Annals</hi> of <hi>Popes,</hi> where she may be properly said to go on foot; but had they looked into <hi>Livy</hi> and <hi>Tacitus,</hi> they would have seen her march like a great Lady, with an Equipage to give her Respect; though not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether so great and Pompous, as that of <hi>Poetry</hi> that goes always with four Horses and those wing'd.</p>
                  <p>Whatever may be the <hi>Equipage</hi> of one or the other, to express my self more plainly, <hi>History</hi> has cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly much of the Air and Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of <hi>Poetry</hi>; but with this Air and Features they are yet different in Matter, Form, Disposition and Locution. A <hi>Poet</hi> contents him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self with the Actions of a Year, which serves him for a Foundation; he builds upon this, makes his own Materials, and gives what Shape what Figure his Fancy pleases; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viates from Truth as much as possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and from particulars; and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies himself to make Models, form Likenesses and Ideas; and as for the
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:42879:41"/>
placing these Materials so work'd, has no regard to the order of time which is Natural, but endeavours after taking the Imagination and Sight, and giving them Pleasure by Surprise.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Historian</hi> labours upon other Matter, and after a different Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: The Actions of several Years, several Reigns, and many Ages, are his Materials, which he places carefully as they are brought to him by others or his own Industry; or if he alters the Truth by adding or diminishing, a Process is taken out against him with as much Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour, as against Falsifiers and Clip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers of Mony. He avoids all Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifice in placing his Matters, Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully observes Succession of time, and disposes every thing according to Nature. And by all these diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences, without touching the Stile that I shall speak of in its due place, may be seen that <hi>Poetry</hi> and <hi>History</hi> are very different, notwithstanding the resemblance <hi>Casteluetro</hi> the <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi>

                  <p>AFter what has been said, who can doubt but that <hi>History</hi> has a peculiar <hi>Art</hi> that directs and governs her, as well as <hi>Grammar Poetry</hi> and <hi>Logick.

                  <p>Nature that constantly keeps her course, and gives the same Forms to all her Works, has no occasion for Art to assist her; the Chymist is not wanting to make her Gold, the Painter to draw her Flowers, nor the Statuary to carve her Men: But those Works that not being necessarily determined to any one Form, are sometimes Perfect and sometimes Defective, according to the Device and Stroaks they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive from the Fancy or Hand of the Workman, must needs want the Assistance of some Art, from whence they may take direction. And as by ill Pictures compared with those of <hi>Myniord</hi> our <hi>French Raphael</hi> (not to search for that in <hi>Italy</hi> we have in <hi>Paris</hi>) we may see there is an Art in Designing
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:42879:43"/>
and Drawing: So by the ill writ Histories of these times, compared with those of Antiquity, we may be convinced Historians require some Art, that may conduct and govern them in a Work so Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant and Difficult, the Wit of Man cannot attempt a greater.</p>
                  <p>The three Principal Functions of this Art, are choise of Mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials that must raise this Edifice of History; Disposition and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellishing of them with such Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours and Figures they are capable of receiving from the Stile, of which hereafter.</p>
                  <p>As to the rest, we must know this Art is not of that number, where a Man may be Apprentice and Master in one day, since all the great Masters of Antiquity have taken care to reduce it into Method and Rules. <hi>Cicero</hi> has done it se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral times, but by occasion only and in passing. <hi>Dion Halicar.</hi> in his Observations on the History of <hi>Thucydides,</hi> where the Censure upon

And to pass by <hi>Pontin, Bodin, Vossius, de Mascordi,</hi> and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral other Moderns, our Worthy and Learned Monsieur <hi>de la Motte le Vayer,</hi> that seem'd to have a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brary in his Head, and gave us ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in his Works, would not let this be the sole Matter without a touch of his Wit.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Actions</hi> or things done, are the <hi>Matter</hi> of <hi>Narration</hi>; and <hi>Judgment</hi> and the Principal Duty of the <hi>Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian,</hi> is to chuse them <hi>True, Great,</hi> and as much as he can <hi>Publick.</hi> To begin with <hi>Truth,</hi> Whatever our Modern Accademist the learned Monsieur <hi>le Vayer</hi> may say other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise; there are no Reasons, no confronting of Witnesses, that ought to be received against her; he will pardon me if in this I pay less de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to him than to <hi>Cicero,</hi> who teacheth me that <hi>Truth</hi> is the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of <hi>History.

                  <p>I am confident our Friend did not intend to shut the <hi>Temple</hi> of <hi>Truth</hi> against <hi>History</hi>; he would only have understood as a new subject for his Sceptical Notions, that all she says has not the same force as the Divine Oracles; and that all Historians have not Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed to her. I may say as much my self, and yet more, namely, there are some that never entred this Temple, but have turn'd their Backs to it as well as to that of Modesty, and yet have made a Revenue by their fabulous and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sipid Relations.

Of these three, the first gives no place to Explications, Dispensations and Privileges; for
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:42879:46"/>
there is no Falsity so Innocent, nor of so little Consequence, the Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian can admit of, he is not only for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid false <hi>Pistoles</hi> and <hi>Crowns,</hi> but <hi>Pence</hi> and <hi>Farthings.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>By the Second, he must not be found at the foot of the Letter without some Explication, for then History would be troubled in every Line with useless Trifles, and sullied with Scandalous Debauches. An Historian must have regard to the End, which is to Instruct and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, and take his Measures from thence, of what ought to be said of with-held. Posterity might very well have been without the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, how often <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth drank at every Meal, and how far his Extravagance run, when the Thoughts of Health and Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence were laid aside.

Emperor was not always Chast.</p>
                  <p>By the Third, <hi>Amplifications</hi> that are Vertues, and give the Merit to an <hi>Orator,</hi> are defended by the <hi>Historian.</hi> This is not so easily ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served, as those may believe, that know not the Movements of a Pen, conducted by an Imagination Fertile in Noble Expressions, and Ambitious of gaining Reputation.

                  <p>'Tis the part of an Honest Man, as <hi>Aristotle</hi> says, not to search

for more <hi>Certainty than the thing will permit.</hi> Let us keep within the bounds of a Just Commerce; and as we give not a <hi>Divine Faith</hi> to <hi>History,</hi> let us not demand a <hi>Divine Certainty</hi>; let us not be more Severe than St. <hi>Augustin,</hi> who absolves the <hi>Historian</hi> that lies not of himself and with design; that is unfaithful only in Relations brought him by others: Neither let us have that idle Credulity of some People, who fear they have injur'd their Neighbours in not crediting some History, it may be that of <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Paris</hi> or <hi>Melusine.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is a <hi>middle way</hi> to be held between the <hi>Easiness</hi> of those that believe all, and the <hi>Obstinacy</hi> of those that believe nothing. The one savours of <hi>Folly,</hi> the other of <hi>Impudence.</hi> For though it has been said all Men are Liers, it does not infer in all Purposes, and at all times. All <hi>Historians</hi> have had a weak Sight, and fail'd in some things (I except only those con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:42879:51"/>
by the Holy Spirit) but for two or three Mistakes let us not be so Rigorous to condemn all Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story. The <hi>Nine Muses</hi> of <hi>Hero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotus</hi> have lived with Reputation hitherto, and no body thought them deserving the Fire or Extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; because sometimes they have turned from the <hi>Truth</hi> towards the <hi>Fable.</hi> And though in what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates to the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Christians, Tacitus</hi> has been convicted of many Falshoods, yet he has not been drove from Libraries where he governs in chief.</p>
                  <p>On the other side, we must not be such Flatterers, and so com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaisant to Antiquity, and to those that have fail'd with design and through Malice, as to take their part against Justice and Truth. The <hi>Athenians</hi> erected a Statue to <hi>Berosus</hi> with a Golden Tongue: The <hi>Romans</hi> another to <hi>Josephus</hi> the <hi>Jewish Historian.</hi> But we will not for that Idolize <hi>Berosus</hi> and his Errors; much less <hi>Josephus</hi> for the <hi>Heathen

Judaism</hi> he has framed in his Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story, in which he has been more Impious than the <hi>Philistians</hi> that placed the <hi>Ark</hi> by <hi>Dagon.</hi> If they joyn'd them, 'twas without Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion; but this Man has made of <hi>Judaism</hi> and <hi>Paganism</hi> mix'd toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, something more Monstrous than the Fabulous Relations of <hi>Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taurs</hi> and <hi>Lapithae.</hi>

                  <p>I am not the first nor alone that have complain'd; I speak but after <hi>Baronius, Melchior-canus, Salmeron, Maldonat,</hi> and many others, great Church-men and Scholars, upon whose Depositions there is neither <hi>Jew</hi> nor <hi>Infidel</hi> but would condemn this Writer. And to make it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, that what I say of his <hi>Gentile Judaism</hi> is no Chimera of my ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, 'tis but to remember that Text in <hi>Exodus,</hi> where God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding the <hi>Jews</hi> to respect those that govern, forbids their speaking <hi>Ill of Gods:</hi> And according to the ordinary Phrase of Scripture, by the Name of <hi>Gods,</hi> is meant the

                     <hi>Magisrates</hi> and <hi>Princes</hi> of the <hi>People. Josephus</hi> changes this Article of the Law in favour of <hi>Dagon</hi> and <hi>Moloch,</hi> as well as <hi>Jupiter</hi> and <hi>Juno.</hi> And where <hi>Moses</hi> says, <hi>Thou shalt not detract from the Gods, nor Blaspheme the Prince of thy Nation:</hi> He makes him say, <hi>Let no body Curse the Gods that are owned for such in other Cities.</hi> And more to provide for the Safety of <hi>Idols,</hi> and to put their <hi>Altars</hi> and <hi>Offerings</hi> out of Danger, after having taken care of their Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he imputes falsly to the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gislator this Law, so contrary to his other Laws, Let none Pillage the Temples of Strangers, nor Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late the Offerings made to any God whatsoever. The Sacrificers of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maria,</hi> the Priests of <hi>Baal,</hi> Could they have Preach'd more advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageously for their Idols, than this Priest of the Tribe of <hi>Levi</hi>?

beat down the False Gods, to break their Statues, and set Fire to their Woods and Temples. Yet this Man makes such a singular Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of the Truth, as if the Pens of <hi>Moses, Daniel</hi> or <hi>Isaiah,</hi> had not been more Sincere and Faithful than his.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. V. That the <hi>Historian,</hi> curious of <hi>Truth,</hi> must not trust to <hi>Fame.</hi> The <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of</hi> Fame. Partial Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions less to be relied on. That he ought to be without <hi>Passion;</hi> as well as <hi>Country<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> and <hi>Party.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>NOtwithstanding there are Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies for these Inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences; and since the first degree of doing well, where Perfection is drein'd from all Defects, is not to be attain'd by Humane Frailty: Let us endeavour after the Second,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:42879:53"/>
where small Faults are passed over; and according to <hi>Horace, Those esteemed Perfect, who have the least Imperfection.</hi> To compass this end, there are three things to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served in the choise of Matters the Historian would work upon: The first is, Not to take them from <hi>Fame</hi> but very seldom, and with great Discretion. The Second, To draw them yet more rarely from the Writings of Interested Persons or Enemies. The Third, To make his <hi>Principal Fund, Relations, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moirs, Letters</hi> and <hi>Instructions</hi> of those who have been either Movers, or Spectators of Affairs, that have had them in their Hands, or before their Eyes.</p>
                  <p>First, He must not trust to <hi>Fame,</hi> she is a Worker of Impostures and Calumnies in every Language, every day: She is accused of Falsity every day; stands convicted without ever Blushing or correcting her Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners: She has a hundred Mouths ascribed her, and not one of them
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:42879:54"/>
can repeat the same thing twice, or any thing like it. In one word, She raises invisible Armies, and with one Breath defeats others that remain entire; after the Rout she Kills and restores to Life; takes away and gives Victories to whom she pleases; and in despite of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, Crowns the Vanquished, and overthrows the Victorious. What Truth can we expect from such a Courier, who has nothing ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily but False News in her Mouth? Mailes fill'd with false Relations, and false Letters. And will not that <hi>Historian</hi> oblige Posterity, that leaves an Extract of all these Vain and Idle Things? And what I say of <hi>Fame,</hi> may be likewise said of <hi>Gazetteers,</hi> those Secretaries with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Credit, who sell themselves to write a thousand Falsities, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stribute them every Week, with the loss of their Reputation.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Since the labour of an <hi>Historian</hi> is different from that of a <hi>Poet,</hi> who makes his own Mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:42879:54"/>
as well as the Figure he gives them: He must do as the <hi>Architect,</hi> inform himself of the <hi>Quarries</hi> from whence he must fetch the Stone and Marble for the Structure of his Edifice. He must remass all the Memoirs, Relations, Acts pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blick and private, that regard the Time, the Persons and Actions, of which he would compose his Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story: But he must have a care those Pieces be authentick, well esteemed, and purged from Falsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications and Disguisements, that carry the Passion of Parties; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise he will impose upon the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blick Faith, and the Deceit will pass from his own Age to Posterity. Above all things he must abstain from certain <hi>Sources,</hi> from whence there is nothing to draw but Filth and Venom.</p>
                  <p>Following this Rule, and being to write of <hi>Charles</hi> the Ninth, he will not search for Truth in the <hi>Memoirs</hi> of <hi>Colligny:</hi> And to make a History of his Successor, he will
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:42879:55"/>
as little consult the Relations of his <hi>Mynions,</hi> though there remains but that of the <hi>Guises.</hi> If he is to write of the <hi>Popes,</hi> and <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> he will not do it from the <hi>Memoirs</hi> come out of <hi>Geneva:</hi> And if he is to speak of <hi>Jesuits,</hi> he will forbear giving Credit to the <hi>Holland Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zettes,</hi> and Faith of Hereticks, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther known or disguised, Ancient or Modern.</p>
                  <p>If the President <hi>de Thou</hi> (other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise a great Man) had thought of these Rules, and had distrusted as he ought the <hi>Dutch Libels</hi> infected with the Poison of Heresie, he had left us a History more correct and less subject to offend the Curious in the matter of Belief. And if others that have followed him, had addressed themselves to <hi>Streams</hi> more Pure than those that flow from the Lake of <hi>Geneva,</hi> the Filth they have suck'd up to bespatter the <hi>Roman Prelates</hi> and <hi>Catholick Princes,</hi> had not recoil'd upon their own Works, Conscience and Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:42879:55"/>
but they thought that a heap of Impostures and Calumnies drawn from the Scandalous Chronicle of <hi>Henry</hi> the Third, and the <hi>Libels</hi> of the <hi>League</hi> and <hi>Hugonots,</hi> would raise their Name; and after that <hi>Salust, Livy</hi> and <hi>Tacitus,</hi> darkned with their <hi>Eclat,</hi> be less esteemed, and give place to them.</p>
                  <p>But because <hi>Ignorance</hi> is not the greatest <hi>Source</hi> of <hi>Falsity</hi> in <hi>History,</hi> and that the most part enter through <hi>Malice</hi> and <hi>Flattery,</hi> and the Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions that cause them: The Care the Historian must have to furnish himself with good <hi>Instructions</hi> and <hi>Memoirs,</hi> will serve him but in little stead, if he does not Disin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest and Purge himself from all sorts of Passion: Where <hi>Interest</hi> is <hi>Master, Truth</hi> is seldom harkned to, and less where <hi>Malice</hi> is <hi>Mistress</hi>; and the Pen of a Writer must be very steady, this Passion does not turn awry.</p>
                  <p>From thence comes the Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieties are found in <hi>Spanish</hi> and <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:42879:56"/>
Histories,</hi> when they speak of <hi>France</hi> or <hi>French-men</hi>: and in those of the <hi>French,</hi> when they speak of <hi>Spaniards</hi> and <hi>English.</hi> Though of all the Writers, of what Nation soever, there are none that write with more Sincerity and Truth, defile their Pens with less Gaul, and do greater Right to the Merit and Valour of their Enemies than ours. 'Tis a Sight capable to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert the most Melancholly and <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grin,</hi> to see in the History of <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doual</hi> the <hi>French</hi> fly before the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards,</hi> like the <hi>Game</hi> before the <hi>Falcon.</hi> When of all People, they can best witness the <hi>French</hi> are not accustomed to use their Spurs with their Swords in their Hands. And 'tis not less pleasant to see in <hi>Guic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciardin Charles</hi> the Eighth enter <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence</hi> in the Habit of <hi>Pacolet</hi>; when this little Man he turns into Ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cule with the Wooden Sword and Spurs he sends him, forc'd his way through the Bowels of all the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick of <hi>Italy.</hi> Let the Historian
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:42879:56"/>
then possess himself he is of all Countries or none; that he is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Father and Mother; without Genealogy or Race, as the ancient King of <hi>Salem:</hi> That he is of no Party but that of Truth, whatever Livery he wears, or whatever Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage he speaks; and that he owes her all his Worship and Devotion, in whatsoever Climate he is found: And that being Debtor (to use the words of St. <hi>Paul</hi>) to the <hi>Fools</hi> and <hi>Wise, Barbarians</hi> and <hi>Greeks,</hi> his Honour, as well as Conscience, is obliged to do Justice, and render every one their due.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. VI. That nothing ought to enter <hi>History,</hi> but what is Great and Illustrious. That trifling things ought to have no Place there.</head>
                  <p>I Have been a little long upon this Article of <hi>Truth,</hi> because she is the Soul and Form of Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story: And the Historian, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Merit he may otherwise have, without <hi>her,</hi> cannot acquit himself of his Duty, nor sustain the Name he bears. Truth suffices not, the things that enter the Composition of History, they must have a solid Grandeur, and <hi>Eclat</hi> arising from their Nature. 'Tis what <hi>Ammi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anus</hi> would say, when he tells us History moves but in high places, marches but upon the Pinnacles and Points of great Affairs.</p>
                  <p>The reason is, <hi>History</hi> being an <hi>Exemplary Philosophy,</hi> invented for the Instruction of the Great, she
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:42879:57"/>
ought to take from them the Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of her Examples, and not give them but their Proportion, esteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them as they are, <hi>Giants</hi> amongst Men; and <hi>Giants</hi> charg'd with the Burden of the World, as the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture expresses it, will not like to have <hi>Puppets</hi> proposed for their Imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>
                  <p>On the other side, The good Form of Government, the Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Civil Society, the Peace and Repose of Kingdoms, being the principal End of <hi>History,</hi> is it to be thought she can arrive at this end, by the relation of Drunken <hi>Bouts,</hi> and the Extravagance of <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>navals.</hi> Another Intention is to eternise the Glory of Illustrious Persons, and preserve them from the Ruin of Age, and Obliquity of Time. And who but knows, Glory is a Light that reflects not, but such Qualities as render Kings and Princes greater than their For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, with all the Grandeur of their Train, Equipage and Riches:
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:42879:58"/>
For if that is all they are, we may say they are only <hi>Dwarfs</hi> upon <hi>guilded Pillars.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A Fourth End of <hi>History,</hi> Is to quicken Noble Minds, and press them forward with an Emulation of the great things she recounts. And a Fifth, To instruct the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent and to come, by the past, and by that to profit the Publick. Can she attain these Ends so high and great, by the Relation of <hi>Bagatells?</hi> Was it the <hi>Lance</hi> of <hi>Achilles,</hi> or his <hi>Lyre,</hi> that stung the Heart of <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi> with Jealousie? Was it the <hi>Bacchanals</hi> and <hi>Debauches</hi> of <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander,</hi> that disquieted the Mind of <hi>Cesar,</hi> and troubled his Repose? And will not Posterity be much obliged by that Historian, that leaves her a Lift of all those Danced in the Mask at the Marriage of such a Prince or Princess? That leaves an Account of the Expence there made in Meats and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitures? The <hi>Italians,</hi> though ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>customed to Contemn all that is
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:42879:58"/>
not of <hi>Italy,</hi> deside their <hi>Corio</hi> where the Army of <hi>John Galeass</hi> Lord of <hi>Milan</hi> most engages his Pen, he abruptly breaks off, and takes oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion, from the Marriage of <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentine</hi> with a Son of <hi>France,</hi> to enter into the Closet of the new married Lady, search her Cabinet, and make a long Inventory of all the Trifles he there finds, to the number of her Chess-men, Knives and Clocks. Did he not believe these rare things carried into <hi>France,</hi> would there be Demonstrations of the Riches and Magnificence of <hi>Italy?</hi> You may see others make a reckoning of all the Habits and Linnen in the Wardrobe of a Prince, and the Furniture of his Chambers; that will teach you the Names of his Dogs and Horses; tell you how many <hi>Trumpets</hi> he has in his <hi>Troops,</hi> how many <hi>Chariots,</hi> and Oven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forks in his Equipage, and of what Stuff are the <hi>Coverings</hi> of his <hi>Mules.</hi> I should like as well one that was to make me the Description of a

Palace, should leave out the Courts, the Portico's, Galleries, Halls and Chambers, and entertain me with the Number, Form and Painting of Weathercocks.</p>

                  <p>Let the <hi>Historian</hi> know then the <hi>Closet</hi> is his proper place; that he ought to be there longer and oftner than in the <hi>Army:</hi> That the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining of <hi>Councils,</hi> unfolding <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigues,</hi> and discovering <hi>Cabals,</hi> are more his Business, than <hi>Desolations, Burnings</hi> and <hi>Massacres:</hi> That he did not take Pen in Hand to learn a private Centinel to manage his Sword, but to teach <hi>Princes</hi> the Art of Reigning, and Statesmen the Art of Serving: To unfold Reasons of State, and the Secrets of Government: And this he does

by disintangling the <hi>Motives</hi> and <hi>Pretexts</hi> of <hi>Affairs</hi>; by following their <hi>Movements</hi> and <hi>Evasions</hi> to the Fountain-head. And as the greatest <hi>Advantages</hi> of <hi>History</hi> are attain'd by this Means, 'tis to that he owes his greatest Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and all the force of his Wit.</p>
                  <p>In this Article that regards the <hi>Grandeur</hi> of things, there is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Defect that ought not to be forgotten: Some, whether through a vain Affectation of things Great and Marvellous, that must not be so much sought after in <hi>History,</hi> nor are not of that value as in a <hi>Poem,</hi> or by a disordered desire to nourish the Curiosity of Readers, and fasten their Attention, fill their <hi>Histories</hi> with <hi>Miracles</hi> and <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digies</hi> they bring in from all Parts. And rather than want, assist at the <hi>Assemblies</hi> of <hi>Demons</hi> and <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicians,</hi> to gather what may fill the Vacancies of certain People, with whom the False and Monstrous
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:42879:60"/>
have better Reception than Truth and Right.</p>
                  <p>Others more bold in <hi>Heroick Prose,</hi> divide <hi>Elephants</hi> in two at one blow with a Sword, strike down <hi>Dragons</hi> of twenty Fathoms long with a little Wand. And for that it is in Scripture, that <hi>Sampson</hi> defeated an Army with the Jaw-bone of an Ass; <hi>Procopius,</hi> not to be behind-hand, tells you of a <hi>Thra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian Soldier,</hi> that with one single Arrow put to flight an Army of <hi>Goths. Paul Venetian,</hi> a greater <hi>Architect</hi> than the <hi>Vndertakers</hi> of <hi>Towers</hi> and <hi>Pyramids,</hi> if I am not mistaken, has built a Town of fifty Leagues in compass, and in it placed 10000 Bridges of so mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strous a heighth, the greatest Vessels under Sail might pass commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously under the Arches. A Town so Great and Magnifick, better Merits to be placed in that fine World, <hi>Lucian,</hi> more Happy than <hi>Columbus,</hi> first discover'd in the Globe of the Moon.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="100" facs="tcp:42879:61"/>You may see others follow a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod very different from this, that have so much Care their Works should not savour the Air of a <hi>Cloister,</hi> or touch upon the Legend for all the World, they will not mention any Miracle whatsoever. The Heathen Authors have been more Religious and more Faithful, and have had more Zeal for their False Gods, far from suppressing the Events by which their Power and Might is made known, they repeat them till they are rendred disagreeable. In <hi>Livy</hi> and <hi>Tacitus</hi> you will find nothing at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning and end of every Year, but <hi>Prodigies</hi> and <hi>Expiations</hi> of them. And shall a Christian Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, to preserve the Reputation of a great Wit, or avoid the Railery of a few <hi>Libertines,</hi> leave out the Relations that are as Witnesses of his Faith, and Proofs of the Power and Providence of that God he adores? As if it were more the Mark of Sense, and for the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:42879:61"/>
of Mankind, to recite the Cruelties of one Prince, and the Debauches of another, than the Wonderful Works by which God is pleased from time to time to awaken our Faith.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Josephus</hi> the Jew has given the first Example of this sort of Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity, to make his Court to the <hi>Roman Princes</hi> in whose Reigns he writ, as <hi>Leon Castrius</hi> has remark'd. He has suppressed, disguised or weakned the Wonders done in the time of his Fore-fathers, as if he feared the God of <hi>Sion</hi> should ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear more Puissant and Great in the Eyes of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> than the <hi>Gods</hi> of the <hi>Capitol.</hi> That <hi>Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous Meteor</hi> that was during so many Years Conductor of the <hi>Jews,</hi> sometimes a <hi>Cloud,</hi> sometimes a <hi>Pillar</hi> of <hi>Fire,</hi> appears not in his History; where his evil Faith has dissipated it, for fear it should give Offence to the sight of the <hi>Gentiles.</hi> 'Tis true, he has not suppressed the passage of the Red Sea; but in the
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:42879:62"/>
manner he speaks of it, he leaves a Doubt, whether the strange Road by which the People passed, was made by some natural cause, or by vertue of some Power Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior to Nature. And after com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring this Miraculous Event, with what arrived to the Great <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi> when marching into <hi>Persia,</hi> he passed the Sea of <hi>Pamphilia,</hi> he leaves every one to believe what they please of one and the other; shewing enough by this Prophane Ambiguity, they were of equal weight, or none at all in his belief. His Prevarication is yet more bold, and his evil Faith more open, in what regards the passage of <hi>Jourdan.</hi> The Holy Scripture tells us in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press terms, That as soon as the Priests that carried the Ark had set their feet in the Water, one part of the River returned towards the Spring, the other towards the Sea, and the People passed over dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shod. <hi>Josephus</hi> finds the Miracle so strong, and yet of so little Credit,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:42879:62"/>
that to reduce it to an Appearance that better pleases his Palate than the Truth, he tells you that three days after God made the Promise, the <hi>Waters</hi> of <hi>Jourdan</hi> being abated, the People passed over the Shallow. And because from the words of the Scripture one cannot figure any thing more <hi>Marvellous,</hi> he adds the Troop of Women and Children were ranged in the midst of the People to prevent their being car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried away by the Rapidity of the Current. What has he done with the Burning Mountain that made the Waters return to their Source? Where has he placed the twelve Stones set upon the Shore in Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of so great a Miracle? He Suppresses all that, to conserve the Reputation of a <hi>Judicious Historian</hi>; and had rather be esteemed <hi>Preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricator</hi> amongst the <hi>Jews,</hi> than <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulous</hi> with the <hi>Romans.</hi> In all this it may be said, he has made as many <hi>Apostasies</hi> as <hi>Falsities</hi> against the Holy Scripture. He ceases not never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:42879:63"/>
to continue in Esteem, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of those that value him, some are ignorant of his Unfaithfulness; and others trouble not themselves, loving rather a Falsity well disguised, than a plain Truth.</p>

                  <p>THere remains to examine, whether an <hi>Historian</hi> can in Conscience, and without Scandal, bloody and defile his Paper with infinite Cruelties and Filth, to which he will be obliged, in case he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves the second Rule, <hi>To hold no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing from the Truth.</hi> If I may be
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:42879:64"/>
credited, all these things ought to be Sacrificed to the <hi>Innocence</hi> of <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story,</hi> and the publick Vertue.</p>
                  <p>First, <hi>History</hi> that ought to be the <hi>Governess</hi> of <hi>Life,</hi> and <hi>Guide</hi> of our <hi>Actions,</hi> becomes a <hi>Scandalous Governess,</hi> a <hi>Dissolute Guide,</hi> by the ill Examples she exposes; that have so much more weight the higher they descend. Is there a more In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous School of Vice, a more Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lainous place of Scandal, and more Dangerous, than the <hi>History</hi> of the <hi>Twelve Cesars</hi> writ by <hi>Suetonius?</hi> And without mounting so high, have we not lately seen with what Boldness the publick Vertue has been violated by a Scandalous De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting History, that was intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced into all the Closets and Stre<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ts, and sullied with its Filth, even the Spouse of <hi>Jesus Christ?</hi> How many Maids and Women, by the reading of this <hi>Petronius Travesty,</hi> have ceased to be what they were before, and said after the Example of the young <hi>Debauchee</hi> in the <hi>Comedy</hi>
                     <pb n="108" facs="tcp:42879:65"/>
mentioned by St. <hi>Austin, Why should not I do as such a Dutchess, What such a Princess has done? Owe I more to my Conscience, more to my Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, than they owe to theirs?</hi> And by what right shall Vertue, so free in a Palace, be constrain'd in a Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate House?</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The Pen gives no right to meddle with the Reputation of others. If Detraction of one Person from another, be a Sin against the Laws of Charity and Justice, what will be that of an Historian, that is a publick Person, made in the sight and hearing of all People and all Ages?</p>
                  <p>On the other side, <hi>Truth</hi> being to <hi>History</hi> as <hi>Form</hi> to <hi>Matter,</hi> if the half be taken away, if Liberty be not given him to unfold all that he finds true under his Hands, she will be but half form'd, the Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian half mute, half lame, and not able to acquit but one half of his Duty.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="109" facs="tcp:42879:65"/>Besides, <hi>History,</hi> as has been said, is a <hi>Philosophy</hi> free from the Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty and Perplexity of Arguments, but rich in Examples, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes with more Right, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swades with more Force. And this Force of Perswasion is not only from good Examples; the ill ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed and well imploy'd, have the same Effect; nay, work sometimes more quick, whether because an evil Action is more lively and pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trating than a good; or that Man being more sensible of Shame than Honour, wants greater speed to Glory, than to help him fly In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famy. Who has not heard the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom amongst the <hi>Spartans,</hi> to make the Extravagant Actions of their Drunken Servants, Lessons of Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance to their Children. And how many Princes have been kept within the bounds of Duty, by the Eternal Chastisement they have seen the Evil suffer upon the <hi>Theatre</hi> of <hi>History.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="110" facs="tcp:42879:66"/>There is a third Reason, that proves it the Duty of an Historian, to be as free in declaring the Vices as Vertues of great Persons: He is Judge, and Judgment reaches the Bad as well as the Good; His Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction is a publick Witness, and 'tis the part of a Witness to conceal nothing. And in fine, 'Tis the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blick Interest, that great Men and Princes, to whom the <hi>Laws</hi> are but <hi>Cobwebs,</hi> should have some Bridle to stop them. And to a People that take <hi>Religion</hi> for a <hi>Fantasm,</hi> and <hi>Hell</hi> for a <hi>Bugbear</hi> to frighten Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, we cannot propose any thing stronger, than the <hi>Eternal Infamy</hi> is prepared for them in <hi>History.</hi>

                  <head>CHAP. X. That the <hi>Right</hi> of <hi>History</hi> permits the <hi>Historian</hi> all sorts of <hi>Truth.</hi> The <hi>Rules</hi> to be observed in the use of this <hi>Right;</hi> with <hi>Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> and <hi>Honour,</hi> and without Scandal <hi>and</hi> Prejudice <hi>to the</hi> Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blick Vertue.</head>
                  <p>IT is my Opinion upon these Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, An <hi>Historian,</hi> as <hi>Publick Witness</hi> and <hi>Judge,</hi> has the right of Evidencing the <hi>Bad</hi> as the <hi>Good,</hi> and to judge of one and the other. But he must be careful not to make his Sovereign Right a Sovereign Injustice; to make of it a Right of Calumny and Detraction. And to the end he may use it with In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence and Desert, he must above all things, particularly apply him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to distinguish the False from the True; the Certain from the Uncertain; and the Private from the Publick. This Distinction pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>supposed,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:42879:67"/>
First he must reject all sorts of Falsities, and guard him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self from imposing any thing, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he himself speaks, or another for him. An ordinary Artifice in Calumniating Writers, who to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stribute more boldly their Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stures, lend them to others they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce in the Scene. He that does after this manner, deserves to have the <hi>Mask</hi> taken off, and be paid in the same false Coin he pays others.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, He must not deliver any thing that is Doubtful or Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain, but impose this Retention upon himself by the Christian Law, forbidding such a Distribution upon severe Damage, whether it be upon the Reputation of those he rashly Censures, or the Conscience of those to whom he gives reason of Scandal, and to judge indiscreetly. Let him Praise as much as he pleases the Doubtful and Uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain; what mistake he may make on this side, being to the Injury of
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:42879:67"/>
no body, none will reproach him, no Process be entred against him, and the Wise will be of his Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion: If finding himself in these Circumstances, he chooses the more favourable for his Neighbour, and hazards a doubtful Truth for an assured Charity; but when he falls upon Censure, he must remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber Uncertainty dispences not with the Respect he owes his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours Reputation; and that he cannot sully it, though agreeable to Fame, without violating the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon right, and doing a publick In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justice.</p>
                  <p>By the same reason, Let him know he is prohibited from look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing too curiously into other Peoples Concerns, to enter the Closets, lift up the Vails, and draw the Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains that cover the Secrets of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, and search wherewithall to entertain the Curiosity of some al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways covetous of Novelties, and ready for Detraction. His Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive reaches not Secret things, that
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:42879:68"/>
are in regard to him as if they were not; and Detraction calls for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration, and Subjects to Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as well as Calumny. And if the Church her self, to whom the Son of God committed the Keys, assumes not the Authority of open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what is shut, and judging of hidden things, much less ought it to be allowed History. To attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to her self any thing like it, the Consequence would be dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous: No place safe where this Evil would not penetrate, followed with ill <hi>Presaging Birds,</hi> no Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion free from their <hi>Venomous Bills.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the Fourth place, Since the Perfection of a Civil Life is the end where his Labours tends, he must expose nothing to the publick View that has not regard to it, must there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore abstain from all sorts of Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous Relations, as are those that serve but to make People lose the Respect they owe their Prelates and Princes, the Hierarchy, Church and publick Government; and gives
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:42879:68"/>
way to Heresies, Revolts and Schisms, both in Church and State.</p>
                  <p>In the Fifth place, Where the Connexion of his Matters, and the Composure of his Works, obliges him to represent the Vices of any that will make a Figure in History; he must remember in such Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentations, to spare as much as he can the publick Vertue; and not give any Colour, let fall any Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression, or leave any Image, that will offend her sight: It must suffice him to explain himself in such ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Terms that cannot cause a Blush or evil Thought, and to touch them but in passing, and make hast away as from an infected place, where his own and others Modesty are in danger. <hi>Salust, Titus Livius</hi> and <hi>Tacitus,</hi> have in this a Reten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of great Instruction and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample for Christian Writers: And 'tis marvellous to see with what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect those that adored <hi>Vicious Gods,</hi> have written of the <hi>Vices of Men</hi>; they seem to blush for Human Kind,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:42879:69"/>
and their words as a Vail cover their Shame as much as possible.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Suetonius</hi> is censured by all the World for the Impurity of his Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story, which is made an Accademy of Debauchery; but if <hi>Suetonius</hi> a Heathen is blamed for his Boldness, what must they say of a Christian that has made a French Copy of all these Latin Obscenities; introduced into the Streets, and Closets of great Ladies, those Monsters of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purity? And how will this Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slator cleanse himself before God, from all the Filth with which he has sullied his Imagination and Hands, and perhaps the Modesty and Conscience of those that an evil Curiosity has carried to those In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous Sights.</p>

And have we not <hi>Historians</hi> that have performed this Duty: Those that oppose the <hi>Commentaries</hi> of <hi>Cesar,</hi> ought to observe this is the Duty but of a <hi>True History,</hi> that <hi>Commentaries, Journals, Memoirs</hi> and <hi>Registers,</hi> are dispenced with. This Law so generally observed, ceases not to be difficult to keep; and I know no part of History ought to be managed more <hi>adroitly</hi> and with more <hi>fineness.</hi> That the Historian may not then act Tumul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuously, and without Method, to the end his Judgments may not be judged, or at least favourably,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:42879:71"/>
let him have a care to secure them free from Rashness, Malice, Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity and Disagreement. He will avoid <hi>Rashness,</hi> if he submit to the <hi>Government</hi> of <hi>Prudence,</hi> that will never permit him to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce, but upon an entire Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, whether of the Grounds and Events of Affairs, or the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives by which they have moved, and the Rounds they have been made take. He that ventures to judge by the Outside and Shew, Subjects himself to great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt; and if there wants but a false Light or Colour to give ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Face, and make another Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, what would be the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudence and Rashness of a Writer, that gives definitive Judgments upon one of these Lights or Colours that first strike his sight.</p>
                  <p>If there be <hi>Rashness</hi> in judging Humane things by the outside; what Indiscretion will that Writer be guilty of, who having not the least Tincture of Theology, seen
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:42879:71"/>
but the outside of Schools where she teaches, thinks himself able to penetrate Secrets the Cheru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bims cover with their Wings; dare make Decisions where the Doctors are in Difference, and pronounce boldly for the one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the other; and turn the Keys of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> and the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of his <hi>Successors</hi>; and submit to the Capacity of his weak Head the highest of all Crowns. At the sight of such an idle Rashness, will they not cry out against the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane,</hi> that dares put his Hand to the <hi>Ark</hi>; against the <hi>Owl</hi> that has the boldness to enter that Light, where the <hi>Eagles</hi> themselves are dazled.</p>
                  <p>And when any one finds him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self enlightned enough to judge the Affairs of the World, he must not do it in the Nature of a <hi>Decree</hi> or manner decisive; it will be well to do it in doubtful Terms, and after the Sceptical way, that having no defence for the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:42879:72"/>
of things, judge but by their Appearances. As long as he holds within these bounds, no body can reproach him of ill; and his Judgments will not be subject to disanulling; but in the Affairs of his Knowledge, and of which he has seen the Springs and Move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; he may leave Expressions of Doubt and Conscience, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose his Judgments affirmatively, provided he does not mingle the Venom of Malice.</p>

                  <p>MALICE is a Fault the Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian must avoid with Care, and yet whether <hi>Corrupted Nature</hi> renders our <hi>Judgments</hi> evil by the same means she does our <hi>Wills,</hi> or by the <hi>Artifices</hi> of <hi>Self-love</hi> we are as easily perswaded to the Prejudice of another as our own Advantage; or whether yet the Vanity of <hi>Mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Interpretations,</hi> that seem to come from a greater degree of Light than others, are more pleasing to Humane Wit; 'tis hard for an Historian to defend himself from the Flattery of this <hi>Malicious Address,</hi> to find the Imperfections of every thing, and incline it to evil. <hi>Salust</hi>
                     <pb n="124" facs="tcp:42879:73"/>
and <hi>Tacitus</hi> are particularly accused of this Fault; and <hi>Tacitus</hi> has yet the Misfortune above <hi>Salust,</hi> that Wits the most Fertile in Sinister In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretations and Malicious Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaries, acknowledge him for their Master.</p>
                  <p>An <hi>Historian</hi> must not only avoid <hi>Malice,</hi> the mark of a Spirit as full of Venom as the Serpent said to Poison all he look'd on, but in Affairs where Uncertainty and Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scurity leave some place for Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence; he must rest his Conjectures upon Colours the most safe, and Appearances the most Vertuous, and form a Judgment as favourable as the thing will suffer. And by that, besides that it will get him the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of an Honest Man, which is not less necessary for an Historian than an Orator, 'twill secure his Person and Work from publick Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred and private Envy.</p>
                  <p>But whatever way he judges, he must take care that his Judgments be given in few words; and remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:42879:73"/>
that a <hi>Preaching Historian</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but be tedious to his Reader that hasts to a new Subject. <hi>Salust, Livy</hi> and <hi>Tacitus,</hi> are marvellous in this way: <hi>Philip Commines,</hi> that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver saw them, had no care to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate them: His Judgments never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless are all good Sence, though drawn out too long; and the Examples he adds, though Just enough, are not after the Models of Antiquity. But that was no part of his Furniture, and as often as he entertains me, methinks I hear an Honest Gentleman, who after the Cloth is taken away, falls a reciting the Passages he remembers in his Travels.</p>

                  <p>TO these three Advices I add a fourth that is not less ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary, nor of less Consequence to the Conscience and Reputation of an <hi>Historian,</hi> that he has regard to his <hi>Birth, Religion</hi> and <hi>Life.</hi> Though the <hi>Tribunal</hi> of <hi>History</hi> be <hi>Sovereign,</hi> and the greatest Persons are there Sovereignly judged, he must not forget notwithstanding the <hi>Respect</hi> due to the <hi>Memory</hi> of those <hi>Princes</hi> have governed his Native Country. And if the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of their <hi>Successors,</hi> and the Truth of History, will have him pronounce upon their Conduct, he must not spare Censure where they have deserved it: But he must ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stain, without Necessity or Profit, making a Scandalous Spectacle in
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:42879:74"/>
the Eyes of the People of their Secret Debauches. Above all, not to condemn them from the Voice of the Vulgar, always Enemy and Calumniator of their Masters; or from the Voice of Fame, always Detractor and Lyar; or from his own ill Disposition: It may be with an Illness not unlike the <hi>Yellow Jaundice,</hi> where they think every thing <hi>Yellow</hi> they see. What I say is occasioned by <hi>Henry</hi> the Third, who more Unhappy, and more decried from the <hi>Vices</hi> of his Age than his own, has been unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily blackned by the <hi>Historians</hi> of the <hi>League</hi> and <hi>Hugonots</hi>; and more unworthily yet, by those that have collected the Impostures of one and the other, and thrown them upon his Memory.</p>
                  <p>But if something be due to his <hi>Birth,</hi> much more to his <hi>Religion:</hi> This Duty being the first and most Obliging, when he is to write of the Church, and Ecclesiastical Princes, the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> and
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:42879:75"/>
Popes, Clergy and Religious, he must not make his <hi>Historick Liberty</hi> a ground for <hi>Licentiousness.</hi> I confess there is always Weakness where there is Humanity; that all those that approach the Sanctuary, are not Saints; nor all those that are near the Altar, Cherubims: But does it belong to an <hi>Historian</hi> to judge his Judges, to condemn those have a Jurisdiction to which the Angels themselves are Subject. 'Tis much the same, as if the Serjeants should cite the Judges of the Court to the Bar, and pretend to make their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess. And what Conscience has an <hi>Historian,</hi> that writes of <hi>Popes</hi> and <hi>Cardinals,</hi> as if he writ from the <hi>Memoirs</hi> of <hi>Beza,</hi> as if hired by the Booksellers of <hi>Amsterdam</hi> and <hi>Geneva.</hi>
                  </p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>ELogy</hi> and <hi>Censure</hi> are the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Parts of <hi>Judgment,</hi> and the <hi>Historian</hi> that forgets them in some Occasions, is accountable to the Publick: They are usually placed either after the Relation of some signal Action of great Fame, or at the Death of Persons that have most appeared, and made the greatest Figure in the Theatre of History. And this hinders not, but they may also find a place, where the <hi>Historian</hi> prepares him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self for Relations of great Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count. <hi>Salust, Livy</hi> and <hi>Tacitus</hi> often use them after this manner, The first begins his two Histories by the Characters of <hi>Catalin</hi> and <hi>Jugurth,</hi> that were the Principal
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:42879:76"/>
Actors in these two Pieces. The Second by <hi>Hannibal,</hi> before he placed him at the Head of the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> and let him loose as a Torrent descending from the <hi>Alps</hi> upon <hi>Italy.</hi> The Third being, To introduce <hi>Vespasian</hi> and <hi>Mutius,</hi> that were to be the Authors of a new Revolution in the Empire, gave the Character of one and the other in such a manner, the most Faithful and most exact Pencil could not have arrived to. But these Pictures ought not to be in great, two or three Colours and as many touches are enough; and less must they be made at Fancy, and drawn Beautiful when Ugly, or on the contrary. And as Truth permits not the <hi>Historian</hi> should do more for any Person, than Vertue and Nature have done; neither does she allow him to rob any one of the Advantages they have received from them; an <hi>Historian</hi> is usually the Drawer of this fort of Picture, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:42879:77"/>
contents himself with <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signing</hi> only, and commits the Finishing to other Persons, to whom he lends his Colours, and makes speak in his place. And this Prudence is principally used when he has nothing to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent but Faults and Censure to put into his Representations. I ought not to forget telling you in this place, that our <hi>Strada</hi> in his <hi>History</hi> of the <hi>Wars</hi> of <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi> has drawn Figures of greater <hi>Proportion</hi> than the ancient Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels: In these Figures (the Abridg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Life) he recites many things Curious and Singular, that gives a perfect Knowledge of the Man, leaves no particular in the Dark, of his Birth, Education, Conduct or Fortune. The <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traitures</hi> he has made of <hi>John d' Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stria, Margret</hi> of <hi>Parma,</hi> Cardinal <hi>Granvill,</hi> Duke of <hi>Alva,</hi> Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> and some others, are after this manner: And the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation they find amongst the

                  <p>I Cannot think to finish my pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose without treating of <hi>Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences,</hi> or if only in passing with a stroke of my Pen. In <hi>History</hi> and in <hi>Poetry,</hi> throughout which they are found, they make so great an <hi>Eclat,</hi> and pierce too lively, not to make themselves re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded. I know they offend some <hi>chagrin</hi> People, and are censured
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:42879:78"/>
by the Severe. But is there any thing so good, against which some ill Nature will not bring an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection? There are that Fancy the <hi>Poppy</hi> and hate the <hi>Rose:</hi> Nay, the <hi>Graces</hi> themselves have their Enemies; and some-body, finding nothing to blame in the Person of <hi>Venus,</hi> reprehended her Dress. We will not then reject Sentences, upon the Condemnation the <hi>Chagrin</hi> and Severe pass upon them: Their ill Nature ought not to prevail above the Reason, Example and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Fathers of History; who often make use of them: Nor must we abandon our selves to the Excess and Liberty of some that abuse them.</p>
                  <p>But because many take for <hi>Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences</hi> certain little playing with words, either ambiguous, opposite or sharp, which seem to compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend much and have nothing in them; 'tis here necessary to disabuse those People, and teach those that may be Ignorant, A <hi>Sentence</hi> after
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:42879:79"/>
                     <hi>Aristotle, is a general Proposition that declares what there is of Good to be followed, or Ill to be avoided.</hi> Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to this Definition received by all the Masters, as on the one hand, all that they say of a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, though never so well pointed, with never so much Wit, cannot be called a <hi>Sentence</hi>; so on the other, They must not place in the Rank of Sentences, General Maxims, and Universal Axioms of Sciences, out of the reach of Morality.</p>
                  <p>There are then (to take the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter after this Definition) but two Kinds of true <hi>Sentences,</hi> The one <hi>Simple,</hi> and made of one Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; the other <hi>Composed,</hi> and made of two; the first of which is sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by the second; and both to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, according to <hi>Aristotle,</hi> make an <hi>Enthymeme</hi> or half Syllogism. For Example, If I say 'tis hard to detain Fortune and get the Mastery of her: This Universal and Moral Proposition, but alone and without a Second, makes but a Simple Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence;
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:42879:79"/>
but if I add a Second that supports it, and say Fortune, naked and slippery as she is, remains a Prize to none, but easily escapes the Hands of all that would retain her: A Sentence composed after this sort will be double; and such Sentences <hi>Aristotle</hi> call <hi>Enthymemes,</hi> because the second Proposition be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing placed before the first, and joyn'd by the Particle <hi>then</hi> which they call Illative, is made a Regular Argument and rightly formed.</p>
                  <p>'Tis fit notwithstanding we should know, that Sentences, which are evident, and have a Clearness in themselves, have no need of a second Proposition to explain them; that would be to light the day, and read before the Sun with a Candle. But those that are not very clear nor certain, that lean to the <hi>Equivocal</hi> and <hi>Paradox,</hi> carry some apparent Contradiction, and enter the Understanding with Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, must not be left without the help of a Second, that may
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:42879:80"/>
make their entrance more easie, by giving them a Clearness and Support. That old Sentence, <hi>A Covetous Man wants as much the things he possesses, as those he possesses not,</hi> is very true; but because, in the Terms that compose it, there is an Opposition that obscures the Truth, there must be a second Proposition that may unfold and make it understood; <hi>The Covetous enjoying as little what they have, as what they have not</hi>; 'tis true to say they want one as much as the other.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. II. Of the <hi>Use</hi> of <hi>Sentences;</hi> And the <hi>Rules</hi> to be observed.</head>
                  <p>THIS Knowledge presupposed, we may proceed to the use of <hi>Sentences</hi>; in which there are four Principal Rules to be observ'd, <hi>Sobriety, Discretion, Justice</hi> and <hi>Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity.</hi> They must be used <hi>Soberly</hi> and seldom, not with the Intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance of those are Angry if any thing falls from their Mouths or Pen but what is Picquant and Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentious. A <hi>Poem, Discourse</hi> or <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story,</hi> with such a Stile, could not be better compared than to a Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, where all the <hi>Trees</hi> were <hi>Hollies,</hi> and <hi>Herbs Thistles.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A <hi>Sentence</hi> has been called the Seasoning of a Stile, it must be used then but by Grains, not made a Feast of. And since the Composure and easie fullness, by which she enters
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:42879:81"/>
so agreeably the Ears and Sense, is broken by this fall of Sentences, without Connexion one upon the other. 'Tis like the stile a <hi>Roman Prince</hi> reproached <hi>Seneca</hi> with, <hi>An Amass of Materials without Cement.</hi> To which may be added, Nature suffers not Precious things to grow in heaps, nor Excellence to be found in a Multitude. And the greatest number of these perpetual Retailers of them, expose for the most part Doublets for Diamonds, and <hi>Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian Pearls</hi> for those of the <hi>East.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sobriety</hi> fuffices not; but to the right use of <hi>Sentences,</hi> there must be in the second place a great <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion</hi> to chose the Persons to whom they are lent, and Places where they are to be employed. In the Choise of the Persons, the Historian must have regard to the Age, Sex, Quality and Rank they have held: And as he must not lend them to Young People, nor the Vulgar, so not to Women unless to a <hi>Livia, Zenobia, Mamilla, Pulcheria, Eudoxia,</hi>
                     <pb n="141" facs="tcp:42879:81"/>
and others such-like, who have wherewithall to sustain the Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur of their words, their Actions, and that of their Dignity. Those that are not of this Rank, ought to hold their Peace, and the <hi>Historian</hi> must not permit them to speak much, if it be not on occasions where some singular Event or Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence forces a sensible Resentment. The <hi>Criticks</hi> are displeased with those <hi>Euripides</hi> sends a Nurse; and those spoke by a Servant in <hi>Plautus,</hi> are paid with Injuries. Let the <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storian</hi> reserve them then for Men, whose Authority, Experience and Quality, have the weight they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand. A <hi>Sentence</hi> is a <hi>Dogme</hi> of <hi>Morality</hi> or <hi>Policy,</hi> a <hi>Precept shortned into three words</hi>; and we expect not such things from a Page or Follower, from the Pen of a Young Gallant, or old Debauchee. Grave Persons, whether with the weight of Years, Office or Dignity, have only right to Dogmatise, give Lessons and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts. And do not we see in the
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:42879:82"/>
Book of <hi>Job,</hi> that one of his Friends, a great Speaker of <hi>Axioms,</hi> is repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended by God, that being Ignorant, and ill instructed, he affected to wrap up a heap of undigested Sentences in a flux of words without Art or Order.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Discretion</hi> of an <hi>Historian</hi> ought to extend to the Choise of <hi>Persons</hi> and <hi>Places</hi> where they are to be put. They are Ornaments I confess, but cease to adorn where they are in Confusion. Gold, Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Stones and Pearls have their places upon the Body and Cloaths; Freizes, Cornishes and Sculptures in Palaces and Temples; and out of those places they would be Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strous and offend the Sight. And I dare say, <hi>Quintilian</hi> that said Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences were to Eloquence as Eyes to the Body, did not intend a Body all Eyes from Head to Foot. Their Ordinary places are Harangues, where they may be display'd with greater Liberty and Judgment; where they serve to confirm what
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:42879:82"/>
they pronouce or decide. <hi>Elogies</hi> upon Eminent Persons, <hi>Reflections</hi> made, and <hi>Instructions</hi> given after the Relation of some great Action or extraordinary Event.</p>
                  <p>But it must be remembred, they ought not to be introduced by force and as fixed in those places; they must be found as it were by chance, without Force, Affectation or look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for, in such a manner, that in the Composure of the stile, they may appear rather as <hi>Shadows</hi> arising from the <hi>Dye,</hi> than <hi>Laces</hi> sew'd upon the <hi>Stuff:</hi> And in this consists the Justice which in the third Rule the <hi>Historian</hi> must observe in the <hi>Vse</hi> of <hi>Sentences.</hi>
                  </p>

                  <head>CHAP. III. Another <hi>Important Rule</hi> to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served in the <hi>Use</hi> of <hi>Sentences,</hi> to the Exclusion of Points contrary to <hi>the</hi> Gravity <hi>of</hi> History. Seneca wrongfully censured for that by <hi>Quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilian.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>THE last <hi>Rule</hi> is <hi>Gravity,</hi> which permits not the <hi>Historian</hi> to retail himself, or lend to whomso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he makes speak, any Sentence that has not Weight and Substance, is not Solid and Serious. By this <hi>Rule</hi> he must abstain from playing with <hi>Antitheses, Equivocals, Allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,</hi> and certain <hi>Periods,</hi> that are, as <hi>Petronius</hi> calls them, but as shin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of broken Glass, they prick and shine, and withall, that there is nothing weaker nor less solid. <hi>Quintilian</hi> compares them sometimes to the Sparks that twincle in the Smoak; and sometimes to little
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:42879:83"/>
Flowers, that being of no consistence, fall so soon as touch'd: And 'tis that, it may be, a worthy Man means, when he calls them the <hi>Emmonies</hi> of words.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Controversies</hi> of old <hi>Seneca, Declamations</hi> falsly attributed to <hi>Quintilian,</hi> the <hi>Panegyricks</hi> of the latter Empire are stiffened through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out with these Points; and if the Expressions of <hi>Tertullian</hi> are said to be Iron and Stone, one may well say these are Nettles and Briars. <hi>Bertaud</hi> the most <hi>Pointilleux</hi> of all the Poets, was called the <hi>Thistle:</hi> He affected not to make a <hi>Stanza</hi> that was not sharp as an <hi>Epigram. Longinus, Hermogenes, Quintilian,</hi> and other Masters of Rhetorick have always protested against this Corruption; and particularly <hi>Quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilian</hi> is every where out of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour with <hi>Seneca,</hi> and accuses him as an Empirick in Eloquence. But if we should take his Opinion, Process would be taken out against him, as a Corrupter of Youth,
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:42879:84"/>
and he banished the Schools and Libraries with as much Ignominy, as the Poets are banished the Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blick of <hi>Plato.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But I cannot avoid saying (what Respect I may otherwise have for <hi>Quintilian</hi>) he makes himself in this too much a School-master; whether his <hi>Criticisms</hi> proceed from Jealousie, or a Peevish Temper, he declaims against <hi>Seneca</hi>'s to ill Purpose, and without reason, and follows the Humour of Pedant Philosophers, always opposing those of the Court. But whatever was the cause with <hi>Seneca,</hi> Serious and Grave through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out; 'tis certain there is nothing more contrary to the Dignity of <hi>History,</hi> and Importance of Matters she handles, than this Madness of playing with little words. The <hi>Historian</hi> is an Interpreter of Truth, Teacher of Civil Life, Director and Counsellor of Princes, an Instructor and Guide to Posterity; and if he should amuse himself with such Trifles, that are only to be bore
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:42879:84"/>
with in Children, Declamators and Scholars of Sophists, it would be as seemly to see a Feather in the Cap of a Senator: And since 'tis Princes, Statesmen, Generals and Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors he makes speak, what he lends must be Richer and more Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantial.</p>

                  <p>THere is yet a Distinction to be made between the <hi>Point</hi> and the <hi>Force,</hi> whether in Thoughts or Expressions. There are certain Bold Thoughts effectually explain'd, certain Expressions flowing from bright Conceptions, yet with a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain'd Light, as in a Point, by
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:42879:85"/>
which are represented in little things of the greatest Grandeur without Diminution. These Thoughts, these Expressions, these Images, belong to Wits of the first Rank. And far from rejecting them with ill Points, we ought to respect them as the Lights of Stars, whether they come from their Nature, or the Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences that inhabit them. As we respect those <hi>Precious Stones,</hi> in which <hi>Pliny</hi> tells you the Majesty and Riches of Nature are abridg'd; <hi>Seneca</hi> (notwithstanding <hi>Quintilian</hi>) the old <hi>Pliny,</hi> and <hi>Tacitus,</hi> are rich throughout with this sort of Riches; and a few Lines taken out of <hi>Tacitus</hi> may serve for Example of this <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>massed Force,</hi> this contracted Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur, of which we speak. In the Life of his Father <hi>Agnicola,</hi> which in my Judgment is the greatest Effort of his Wit, he introduces a <hi>British Captain</hi> speaking against the <hi>Romans</hi> in these words. <hi>These Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of all the World, now the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hausted Lands can no more furnish
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:42879:85"/>
their Rapine, think to Rifle the Seas: Where they meet with Opulent Enemies, they are Cruel through Covetousness: Where with Poor, through Ambition. The East and West, vast as they are, cannot satisfie; they alone with like greediness throw themselves upon the Poverty and Riches of Nations. All they aim at is but to Ravage and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy, to Ravish the Empire under false Pretensions: Yet they Vaunt to have established Peace in Provinces they themselves have rendred Desolate, If the Modesty of our Wives and Sisters saved them from Violence, when they were our Enemies: It cannot now they are become our Guests from their Lasci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious Friendship. Slaves, that Nature and Fortune destined to Servitude, having once sold themselves, are nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished by their Masters. 'Tis</hi> Brittain <hi>only buys her Slavery, Supports and Nourishes her Oppressors.</hi> These are Lightnings that dazle the Sight, Thunders that Astonish; and if Nature had given the use of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to Lyons, they would thus
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:42879:86"/>
have expressed their Anger and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation.</p>
                  <p>Here I should speak of <hi>Instructions</hi> and <hi>Precepts,</hi> that are not less the Office of an <hi>Historian</hi> than <hi>Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences</hi>; but having the same End and Form, and being under the same Definition, what I have said of <hi>Sentences,</hi> may comprehend them also. The use of them must be as Sober, Moderate and Restrain'd, and the Historian that would not leave his Instructions subject to the Censure of the Grave and Wise, must have the same Discretion and Regard in the Management of them.</p>
                  <p>I shall only say in the Matter of <hi>Precepts,</hi> the best and least Pedan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick way is the Oblique. When the Historian, not willing to make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self a Tutor in the Eyes of the World, lends them to another: By this Innocent Artifice, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modated to Mens Fancy, that value more things at a distance, than near at hand, the Reader, that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps

                  <p>This in favour of <hi>Descriptions,</hi> that certain <hi>Criticks</hi> would take from History: But those are People that are pleased with nothing that is Pleasant; and were they let alone
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:42879:88"/>
with their <hi>Chagrin,</hi> they would pull the Stars from Heaven, and Eyes from our Heads. But <hi>Descriptions,</hi> how Beautiful soever we make them, must have their Rules, as all other beautiful things that cease to be so, when they cease to be go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned. Let <hi>Wariness</hi> then be the first Rule in the use of Descriptions, and the <hi>Historian,</hi> though never so ready in this way of <hi>Drawing,</hi> must not pride himself to multiply them in <hi>History,</hi> and shew his Wit to the Prejudice of his Judgment. That which pleases in one season and place, pleases not always nor every where; and Rarity gives value to many things. We seldom admire the <hi>Sun,</hi> because she shews her self every day; when the <hi>Comets,</hi> that have nothing taking, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce what is Ill and Ungrateful, because they appear not every Year, draw the Eyes and Admiration of all the World.</p>

                     <hi>Historian</hi> as the <hi>Reader,</hi> it would be very Ungenteel for the one, and unuseful for the other, to search Repose at every step. Besides a multitude of <hi>Descriptions</hi> would be a Confusion and Obstacle to the course of History; and the <hi>Reader</hi> being desirous of coming to an end, would suffer with Impatience these delays, notwithstanding the Care taken to embellish them. Let the <hi>Historian</hi> remember then, <hi>Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions</hi> being the principal end of his Labour, to which <hi>Descriptions</hi> serve but little, and only by way of Ornament, he ought not to use them but when Prudence and Occasion require.</p>

                  <p>The less Severe Criticks of <hi>Italy</hi> would not pardon one of their <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storians,</hi> who in a long and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blesome Description of a Feast made at <hi>Rome</hi> for the King of <hi>Navar</hi>'s Daughter, in her passage to Marry the Duke of <hi>Ferrara,</hi> leaving the Duty of an <hi>Historian,</hi> and taking upon him that of <hi>Maistre d'Hostel,</hi> obliges his Reader against his Will, to see the Account he gives of all the Services and Expence made at that Feast.</p>

                  <p>By the same reason in describing of Battles, after ranging the Troops of one side and the other, he must not amuse himself to represent the Horses, Arms, Devices and Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners; to tell all the Thrusts made

                  <p>This Fourth Rule demands Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gor and Force of Spirit, to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served as it has been by the Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians, who have had wherewithall to support the length of their Work, and extent of their Fame.

                  </p>
                  <p>But the Force and Vigor this Rule requires, must be accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with Judgment and Discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as all others, for fear the <hi>Vessel of History</hi> (to speak again in <hi>Lucian</hi>'s Phrase) <hi>pressed by the

                  <p>FOR the sixth and last Rule, An Historian must not enter into any Country where he is Ignorant of the Language, without an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreter to assist him. I mean he must not undertake to describe any thing he does not know, or has not been informed of. Otherwise he will but form <hi>Chimera's,</hi> where he thinks to draw <hi>Representations:</hi> Speak of War in a Court-Stile; and of <hi>Navigation</hi> in Terms of Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandry: Will take the Country for the Soil; and when he has an Assault or Battle to describe, will do it in the words of a Proctor, who
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:42879:94"/>
gives an account of his Proceedings in the Pursuit of a Process.</p>
                  <p>In despight of the great and little <hi>Atlas,</hi> against Nature her self he will make a New World, and Maps as new; as those <hi>lately</hi> made for the Globe of the Moon: Place the <hi>Lap.</hi> and <hi>Fin-landers</hi> under the Line, and <hi>Ethiopians</hi> under the Pole; bring the <hi>Pyramids</hi> from <hi>Egypt</hi> into <hi>Italy,</hi> and carry the <hi>Italian</hi> Aque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducts into <hi>Egypt:</hi> Not content to take away one side from the <hi>Apenins,</hi> he will transport it all into <hi>Asia</hi> or <hi>Africk.</hi>

                  <p>Such-like Miracles have been done by <hi>Historians</hi> that were not <hi>Saints,</hi> if we believe <hi>Lucian,</hi> who says, That in his time there were that carried whole Towns out of one Country into another, with as much ease as a Gard'ner Transplants his Flowers; and further make as <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious Transformations</hi> as those in <hi>Ovid</hi>'s <hi>Metamorphosis,</hi> turn Towns into Captains, and Captains into Towns; for which the Mareschal

I know all the World is not of his Opinion, but what is <hi>Raymund Lully,</hi> and others that
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:42879:95"/>
imbrace the contrary, but <hi>Pigmies</hi> opposed to this <hi>Achilles</hi> of the long Robe. <hi>Diodorus</hi> of <hi>Sicily</hi> produced against <hi>Harangues,</hi> condemns but those that intangle and dismember a Narration, put things out of their Method by their unreason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able length, or number yet more tedious.

                  <p>'Tis opposed to this, That the Law which permits nothing false in History, is violated by these <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangues,</hi> that are all false, and framed by the <hi>Historian</hi>: That Probability alledged to maintain them, is an Usurpation upon the <hi>Poets,</hi> and she shamefully abused.

                  <head>CHAP. II. That <hi>Harangues</hi> are necessary in <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story,</hi> not contrary to Truth nor Probability. <hi>Historians</hi> and <hi>Poets</hi> justified thereupon.</head>
                  <p>ALL these Reasons conclude nothing against <hi>Harangues.</hi> The <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Truth</hi> ought not to be understood, but of things that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving some consistence either by Tradition or Writing, might come entire and without Alteration to the Knowledge of the Historian; he is obliged to take them as they come to him by these ways, and the Law of Truth confines him, that without changing any thing either in Matter or Figure, he should make use of them such as they are. 'Tis not so with Words that have <hi>Wings,</hi> as a <hi>Greek Poet</hi> says, and after the <hi>Arabian Conceit</hi> are the <hi>Birds</hi> of <hi>Carriage,</hi> no Nets
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:42879:97"/>
can take them, no Bands hold them; and it would not be enough the Historian was a <hi>Magician,</hi> he must yet be a <hi>Prophet,</hi> if he was to recite every Syllable (as the Messengers of <hi>Homer</hi>) of all that was said by Persons introduced in his History; notwithstanding there are Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions where 'tis necessary they should speak; for a <hi>Trader</hi> that is <hi>Dumb,</hi> a <hi>Counsellor Silent,</hi> an <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassador</hi> without <hi>Words,</hi> would there make but strange <hi>Figures.</hi> The <hi>Historian</hi> must then make them <hi>Speak,</hi> and lend them <hi>Words,</hi> and that is found better than if they should all express themselves in different Languages, and renew the <hi>Confusion</hi> of <hi>Babel</hi> in every <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In making <hi>Harangues</hi> the <hi>Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian Vsurps</hi> not upon the <hi>Poets</hi>; there are that belong to each of them, but with this difference, the one is founded upon Truth to the Exclusion of Falshood; the other upon Falshood<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to the Exclusion o<gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="1 letter">

                     <pb n="171" facs="tcp:42879:97"/>
Truth; because Falshood coloured and disguised, gives all the Honour to Poetry.</p>
                  <p>Two Famous Examples in Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story and Poetry, that deserve Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation, will clear better this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine: The first in the Fourth Book of <hi>Virgil</hi>'s <hi>Aeneids,</hi> where <hi>Dido,</hi> moved by Love, Despite, Despair and Fury, whether she stirs or speaks, does all so probably, so well composed, so natural, one cannot see her without Loving, Hating, being in Anger, and Mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with her. Notwithstanding this resemblance of Truth is ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon as great a Falshood as ever was. And it was not enough for <hi>Virgil</hi> to raise the Winds and Seas, employ all the Gods that preside over <hi>Tempests,</hi> to bring his <hi>Aeneas</hi> to <hi>Carthage</hi> in the time of <hi>Dido,</hi> he was further obliged to force <hi>Chronology,</hi> and do Violence to two Ages.</p>
                  <p>The other in the First Book of <hi>Livy,</hi> where the Fair and Chast
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:42879:98"/>
                     <hi>Lucretia,</hi> Mad with the Outrage offered to her Honour, expresses her self in so becoming a manner, and in Terms so Natural, no body but would believe the words her own. And that happens, because the Truth of the thing drawing with it the Probability of Words founded upon it, gives them part of those colours that then must pass for true. Are Ambassadors accused of Falshood, that express themselves more elegantly than their Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions: And the Letters of a Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary of State, do they cease to be true, and the Prince's, because they are more enlarged, and in better Terms, than in the Original?</p>
                  <p>'Tis then a Calumny, to say the Truth of History is violated by the Resemblance in <hi>Harangues.</hi> And the Injury goes yet further, for this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenchment must be likewise made in <hi>Judgments, Reflections</hi> and <hi>Conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures,</hi> that are Parts so Essential to History, she ceases to be when they are taken from her.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="173" facs="tcp:42879:98"/>
                     <hi>Livy, Tacitus</hi> and <hi>Quintus Curtius,</hi> are not only accused for having laid aside Truth, but Probability, in lending more Wit, Politeness and Eloquence, to those they make speak, than the Genius of their Country and Manners of their Age will bear. It must be answered, That Sense and good Wit are the Growth of every Country, and all Ages: That <hi>Scythia</hi> has had her <hi>Philosophers</hi> as well as <hi>Greece:</hi> And at this time the <hi>Canadins,</hi> notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing the Barrenness of their Soil, are born <hi>Eloquent</hi> and <hi>Haranguers,</hi> and have a Natural Rhetorick, as figured and Sententious, as that we are taught in Schools and Books.</p>
                  <p>Besides, The <hi>Poets,</hi> so great Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servers of Resemblance and Proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, never thought it adviseable to change the <hi>Stile</hi> as they change the <hi>Persons.</hi> There is but <hi>Plautus</hi> that pleases himself with playing the <hi>Trivelin,</hi> as one may say, in affecting such an odd unusual Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod. But if we believe <hi>Horace,
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:42879:99"/>

                  </head>
                  <p>THE <hi>Historian</hi> that will be Curious in the Fitness and <hi>Regularity</hi> of his <hi>Harangues,</hi> must above all have regard to the Age, Quality, Credit, and Desert, of those he makes speak. It must be otherwise here than in a <hi>Comedy,</hi> where the <hi>Vallet</hi> has his turn as well as the Master. And 'tis not much, <hi>Princes, Statesmen, Captains</hi> or <hi>Ambassadors,</hi> have right to be heard, because the most <hi>Subtile Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts</hi> of <hi>Policy</hi> are ordinarily in <hi>Harangues</hi>: And an Officer of the Wardrobe, a Life Guard-Man, or a Clerk of the Palace, that would appear Men of Importance, would
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:42879:100"/>
make in History as base an Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruity, as could be made in Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, He must not employ his Rhetorick throughout, but only upon Occasions, and <hi>Matters</hi> that have wherewithall to sustain it. Times of Battel were heretofore proper for <hi>Harangues,</hi> but now that Fashion is almost out of Date; and the Forwardness of the Soldiers Courage, leaves little room for the Captains Eloquence.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Consultations,</hi> where are treated of Peace and War, Alliance or League, Abdication or Election of a Prince, Examples of Justice or Clemency, and the like Affairs of great Account, are proper places for <hi>Harangues</hi>; but to use them upon the Death of a Foot-Captain, Preparation of a Hunting-bout, or the Attack of a Barn, is to abuse <hi>Rhetorick,</hi> and spend a great many fine words to no purpose. Such <hi>Harangues</hi> would be like those made in the Senate before the Emperor,
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:42879:101"/>
about the Seasoning of a <hi>Turbut</hi> of extraordinary size, if <hi>Juvenal</hi> may be credited.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thucydides</hi> and <hi>Salust,</hi> though so great Men, and both Chiefs of their Order, are reproached with having fail'd in this Rule: The one in a long Mournful Harangue made by <hi>Pericles</hi> at the Funeral of Fifteen Gentlemen that died in the Service of the Republick; was not this to expose the second <hi>Jupiter</hi> of the <hi>Athenians</hi> (so <hi>Pericles</hi> was called) to abuse his Lightnings and Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, employing them in so mean a Matter. But the <hi>Historian</hi> lend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his words to the <hi>Orator,</hi> would make it appear he was not less one than the other, and that his Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence was able to make as much noise in Writing, as the other had done with his Voice. However the Funeral of Fifteen Soldiers might have been made with less Expence, and the Mournful Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion better employ'd at the Obse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quies of those <hi>Athenians</hi> lost in <hi>Sicily</hi>
                     <pb n="179" facs="tcp:42879:101"/>
in greater Numbers and with greater Glory. But <hi>Pericles</hi> was then Dead, and there was never another <hi>Orator,</hi> to whom the <hi>Historian</hi> could lend his Eloquence.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Latins</hi> have not been more <hi>Regular</hi> in this than the <hi>Greeks: Salust</hi> Harangues throughout, and almost every where without occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion. In the Conspiracy of <hi>Cataline,</hi> the long <hi>Harangues</hi> Obscure and Contract too much the Narration; and in his <hi>Jugurthin</hi> War, the great Discourse made by <hi>Memius</hi> Tribune of the People, without any other Reason than the Reputation of the Man for one of the best Speakers of his Time, makes it plain enough he takes all Occasions, right or wrong, to make Satisfaction by his Historick Eloquence, for the ill Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess of his <hi>Oratorian.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Let the <hi>Historian</hi> then take for a Third Rule, in Composition of <hi>Harangues,</hi> to avoid Multitude and Length; by which the Narration is broken, the Reader retarded and
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:42879:102"/>
put out of his way, as by Hedges and Ditches in the Road of a Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veller that hasts to his Journeys end. There is no Labour more Ungrateful, nor more Unhappy, no words worse employ'd, and they are declined by all as infected places. And if heretofore a Gallant Man chose rather a Prison, than give his Approbation to an ill Poem; those may be found, that think the <hi>Gallies</hi> more Supportable than the reading such <hi>Harangues.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Boccalin</hi> is very pleasant in his Occurrences of <hi>Parnassus,</hi> and makes appear the Pain suffered in this kind of Lecture: He tells you, That an Old Man being found reading a <hi>Madrigal</hi> under a Laurel-Tree with his Spectacles on, 'twas judg'd by the Senate a Scandalous thing, and he condemn'd by universal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to the reading an <hi>Harangue</hi> in <hi>Guiccardin.</hi> Since they have been made shorter even in <hi>France,</hi> where they were altogether as troublesom.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="181" facs="tcp:42879:102"/>In the Fourth place, He must not forget <hi>Aristotle</hi>'s Rule, that <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangues</hi> made to be read, require more Art and Study in their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posure, than those to be spoke. And likewise this Study ought not to be that of a <hi>Sophist,</hi> to beat about the Bush and smooth a Period; this Art not to be placed in Affectations of Points, Antitheses, and such-like Figures, that are but to say the <hi>Coequetaries</hi> of <hi>Rhetorick:</hi> All there ought to be Grave, and accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dated to the Condition of Persons, and Qualities of Affairs. And if Agreeableness, so much recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended by the Masters of this Art, demands Application throughout, in this place more particularly. For a King to speak like a Sophist, a Captain like a Declamator, an Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassador to deliver his Credentials in Points, would make strange Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures: They might as well go to Council, Battel and Audience, in the <hi>Habits</hi> of <hi>Comedians.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="182" facs="tcp:42879:103"/>
                     <hi>Pathetick Characters</hi> and <hi>Passionate Movements</hi> have also their place in <hi>Historical Haranguers,</hi> but they must come naturally, and without Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence. The Subject and Occasion bring them in, nor are they to enter with the Noise and Tumult they make in Oratorical Actions, where they are as Thunders and Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings in a Cloud big with Tempests. <hi>Historick Eloquence,</hi> that speaks but from the Pen, has no Voice nor Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour, must be more Calm and Reserv'd. And 'tis not in the Closet, and upon Paper, is expected Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-bolts and 'Storms, like those this second <hi>Jupiter</hi> of the <hi>Athenians</hi> made in the Assembly of the People. I will not further enlarge upon the other Riches, that belong to the Composition of <hi>Harangues,</hi> 'twould be a return to the <hi>College,</hi> and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croachment upon the Profession of <hi>Cicero</hi> and <hi>Quintilian,</hi> that have given long Lessons for them.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>DIgressions</hi> have the last place in the Parts of <hi>History,</hi> but I cannot see for what Right, or Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, this last place is given them. Where they are absent, there is no Want; and where found, many times Troublesome. <hi>Livy</hi> has a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided them with Honour; <hi>Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius</hi> and <hi>Salust</hi> abridg'd them to their Reputation. Those who would have <hi>Digression</hi> to <hi>History,</hi> as an <hi>Episode</hi> to <hi>Poetry,</hi> know neither one nor the other. A Poem without an <hi>Episode,</hi> is but the Carcass of a Poem; <hi>Whereas there is nothing want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to an History without Digressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> To what would they reduce the <hi>Aeneids,</hi> if the <hi>Sack</hi> of <hi>Troy,</hi> the <hi>Loves</hi> of <hi>Dido</hi> and <hi>Aeneas,</hi> the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription</hi> of <hi>Hell,</hi> and other <hi>Episodes,</hi> which are as the Porticoes, Galleries,
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:42879:104"/>
and Anti-chambers, to a Palace, were taken from her? And what would the History of <hi>Tacitus</hi> lose, if that long and fabulous Digression of the Worship and Temple of the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dess of <hi>Cyprus</hi>; and that other longer of the Original and Religion of the Jews, fill'd with Falsity and Malice, were retrench'd? Notwithstanding the Esteem I have for him, and the Pleasure I take in his Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as often as he comes to them, I profess my self tired, and all I can obtain of my Patience, is to attend till he has done.</p>
                  <p>But since it so pleases the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, let us suffer Digressions in History, and say, for Instruction to those that desire them, they are either <hi>Geographical, Historical, Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical</hi> or <hi>Moral.</hi> In <hi>Geographical,</hi> The Author gives the Description of some Country he finds in his way: Such, in the <hi>Jugurthin</hi> War, is that of <hi>Africk.</hi> In <hi>Historical,</hi> is recited some particular Adventure; as that of the two Friends that <hi>Salust</hi> speaks
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:42879:104"/>
of in the same place; or in the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal of some State, People or Town; the two Digressions of <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citus,</hi> that I have mentioned, are of this kind. In <hi>Political,</hi> is given In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction to Princes, Statesmen and Officers; there are Examples in <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lybius</hi> of every sort: And this may be said without saying too much, That in the Republick of <hi>Plato,</hi> and Politicks of <hi>Aristotle,</hi> there are Maxims and Axioms have less of Policy than in this History. In the <hi>Moral,</hi> the Historian gives Lessons upon Vertue and Vice, a Good and Evil Life, and the Consequences of one and the other. <hi>Salust</hi> gives an Example in the long Digression he makes in his <hi>Cataline,</hi> of the Birth, Progress and Fall of the Republick: And though he is full of Spirit, Rules and Sentences, he takes up too much space in so little a Work: And it may be said in that place, the Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian does like a tired Traveller, that having but one days Journy to go, stays two at the first Inn he meets
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:42879:105"/>
with. All these Rules, all these Sentences, received under the name of <hi>Fabius</hi> and <hi>Cato,</hi> lose their Force and Edge under that of <hi>Salust.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Let the <hi>Historian</hi> then remember, not to make unnecessary Digressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which serve not to dress, clear, or sustain his Matter; and that those he does make, are very rare and short. Otherwise, being but Resting-places, as <hi>Livy</hi> calls them, or Inns as others, he will be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach'd with making more Rests than Way, and as many Inns as Rests.</p>

                  <p>IT is not enough the Architect has Marble and Stones, and the Art to work them, he must yet know the Placing, Building and Connexion they require. Without that, he will put that below that should be above, that behind that should be before; and in lieu of a Palace, make a Monster of Stone,
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:42879:106"/>
as the <hi>Italian Architects</hi> say. This Knowledge of Order and Placing, is not less necessary for the Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian, if that be wanting, his richest Materials, ill joyn'd or ill placed, will be but as Heaps of Stone with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Mortar, Connexions, Symmetry and Form. But as there remains but two Pieces to dispute and place, the <hi>Preface</hi> and <hi>Narration,</hi> the Disposition, so necessary, cannot be difficult.</p>
                  <p>He will begin then by a Preface, which is to him as a Prelude to those that play upon the <hi>Theorbo</hi> or <hi>Violin</hi>; by that he prepares the Mind and Affection of the Reader, and disposes him to a continued and favourable Attention. Let him not follow the Example of <hi>Cesar,</hi> that has no Preface at the Front of his <hi>Commentaries. History</hi> is a more finished Structure, has Body, Parts, Proportion and Measure, according to Art; and to a Building of this Nature, there must be other Skill and Order than in <hi>Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries</hi>
                     <pb n="189" facs="tcp:42879:106"/>
and <hi>Memoirs,</hi> that are but as a Mass of Materials waiting for the Hand of the Workman. The <hi>Lovre,</hi> though so Magnificent and Great, offends the Light, and baulks the Imagination, by its yet want of a Portal: And a History, though composed by <hi>Livy</hi> or <hi>Tacitus,</hi> would not less offend those that see it without a Preface: <hi>Lucian</hi> says, such Works are Bodies without a Head.</p>
                  <p>But whether we take her for a Portal or Head, she is not left to the Fancy of the Workman: She has her Rules, that must not be violated, without doing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the <hi>Rudiments</hi> of <hi>History.</hi> She must be rightly adapted, of Just Measure, Modest and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to the rest of the Body. One cannot, says <hi>Horace,</hi> without Laughing, see the <hi>Head of a Man upon the Neck of a Horse,</hi> and it would be as Extravagant to see a Horses Head upon a Man's Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. Such-like Representations,
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:42879:107"/>
are only fit for Signs to those odd Animals exposed in a Fair. And there is nothing more resembles those Monsters, than a History that begins with a common Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face, not immediately relating to the Subject, but would serve as well a <hi>Spanish</hi> as a <hi>French Narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi> as proper to the Wars of <hi>Solyman,</hi> as those of <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth. <hi>Salust,</hi> that <hi>Roman Antiquity</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses for one of her most perfect Models, is fallen willfully, and seeing his Fault, into this Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruity. He begins his <hi>History</hi> of the <hi>Conspiracy</hi> of <hi>Catalin</hi> and the <hi>Jugurthin</hi> War, by two <hi>Moral De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations,</hi> which belong as little to their Subjects, as a Doctors Cap to a Soldier. 'Tis possible they were the Remains of his Oratorical Profession, and he thought it better to place them there, whatever ill Figure they might make, than to lose them.</p>
                  <p>Whatever <hi>Salust</hi> might mean, besides that these two Prefaces
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:42879:107"/>
have as little to do in the places they are put, as any other; they are not of right Measure. And it may be said, That being so long as they are, they make there the same Figure, to use <hi>Lucian</hi>'s Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison, as the Head of a <hi>Colossus</hi> upon the Body of a Dwarf. The Historian must have a care of this second Fault; his Preface must be short and close, especially before Histories of little Bulk: And if he does not prefer the vain Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Eloquence, to the Prejudice of his Judgment, he must not do as that Architect who made the Entrance of a Chappel large enough for a Cathedral Church.</p>
                  <p>Above all, let him avoid <hi>Osten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation</hi> and <hi>Pride,</hi> that more becomes a Captain in a Comedy, than the Wisdom of an Historian, from whom is expected more Modesty and Gravity than any other Writer. By that he will gain the Good Will of his Reader, make him more Favourable and Antidate against
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:42879:108"/>
the Venom Envy carries in her Eyes and Tongue. And his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desty will obtain that Indulgence from the Criticks, would never have been allowed to his Quality or Merit. On the contrary, The softest Natures are exasperated, the Charitable not less than the Envi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, the Doves as well as the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents, have their Gaul, and turn their Beeks and Claws against those that force them. And the Work, whatever Merit it may otherwise have, will suffer the Chastisement due to the Presumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Workman. 'Tis yet worse, when the Desert does not support this Presumption; when in lieu of Marble and Jaspar that was expected, is placed course un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polish'd Stuff; and a Country Cottage in the room of a Palace: Such things are not to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured, and no body but would Laugh at the Extravagance, to speak after <hi>Lucian,</hi> of Armour made with Osier and Bark of
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:42879:108"/>
Trees, under a Guilded Head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piece.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Historian</hi> must begin then with Modesty, and double it when he speaks himself; do it in such a manner, the Ink and Paper, if it were possible, should blush with him. And this hinders not his speaking Magnificently of his Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, if deserv'd, because 'tis not his own making. He may praise it with the same Modesty a Sculptor does his Marble: This will be a Spur to the Curiosity and Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Reader, and a Preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vative against the Trouble and Wearisomness, as ordinary in long Lectures as long Voyages.</p>

                  <p>THE <hi>Historian</hi> ought not to pass from one <hi>Preface</hi> to another, as some have done, that were to build <hi>Portal</hi> upon <hi>Portal, Threshold</hi> upon <hi>Threshold,</hi> and two <hi>Heads</hi> upon one <hi>Body.</hi> He must enter his Relation, and follow it with an equal Composure, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Interruption, and according to the <hi>Order</hi> of <hi>Events</hi> and <hi>Time.</hi> This <hi>Order</hi> is one thing in <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story,</hi> another in <hi>Journals</hi> and <hi>Annals:</hi> In <hi>Journals</hi> the Method is to follow the Accidents of a Day: In <hi>Annals</hi> of a Year. <hi>History</hi> is not so much confin'd, though she is obliged to observe Time, and go hand in hand with it: She is not so tyed, that she cannot some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:42879:109"/>
free her self, and follow the Course and Events of Affairs.</p>
                  <p>This Method of sometimes fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, and sometimes leaving Time, presupposes the Distinction of two <hi>Orders</hi> founded upon the Doctrine of <hi>Aristotle</hi> and <hi>Horace.</hi> Of these two <hi>Orders,</hi> says the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, the one is Natural, the other Artificial. By the first, things are conducted equally, and with the same course, from the beginning to the end: By the second, they go and stop by Intervals, as the Writer pleases, that one while shews, another hides; sometimes leads strait, then through by-ways, to raise the Curiosity of the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and keep up Desire and At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention. This second Order, is that ought to be kept in Fabulous Structures, as are <hi>Poems</hi> and <hi>Romances. Homer</hi> has given the first Example in <hi>Greek, Virgil</hi> the second in <hi>Latin, Tasso</hi> the third in <hi>Italian.</hi> And if it be permitted to name my self after these great Artists, I have

                  <p>An <hi>Historian</hi> that is the Servant of Truth, and labours to establish her, has nothing to do with this Art of Disguising and Imposture; the natural Order is what she de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands: And because it may be taken from the Chain of things to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and their relation to time, the <hi>Historian</hi> is free to chuse which he thinks most open, least engaged, least subject to embarrass, and most proper to make entrance for his Matter in the Memory of the Reader.</p>
                  <p>There is yet some difference to be made between <hi>Vniversal Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story</hi> of many <hi>States</hi> and <hi>Nations,</hi> without Relation, without Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance one upon the other; and particular but of one State, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or Reign. In the <hi>Vniversal,</hi> the Order of Time must accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany the Order of Places, and the <hi>Historian</hi> avoid following <hi>Ariosto,</hi> and other Architects of Irregular
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:42879:110"/>
Fables; that without Vessels, or Wings, and what is worse, Example; without Need or Subject, boldly cross the Seas, and pass in a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from one Pole to the other. And whilst you are most attentive to something Strange that is done in <hi>France</hi> or <hi>Spain,</hi> you are car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried from thence of a sudden into <hi>Asia</hi> or <hi>Africk.</hi> He must give himself leasure, as much as the time will permit, to finish what he has begun in one Country, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he goes into another. <hi>Hero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotus, Diodorus</hi> of <hi>Sicily, Justin,</hi> and others who have undertaken <hi>Vniversal Histories,</hi> have held this Method; and their Example, is a Rule for all those that would after them enter this vast Tract.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Particular History</hi> gives no such Fatigues, nor obliges to make such long Journies: She is shut up in one Country, from whence she is not permitted to stir, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out some Necessity draws her;
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:42879:111"/>
there she adjusts, as near as possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, the Course of things to that of time; but without tying her self to the Calender, without keeping Register of the Days or Years: When Events are so mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured, and go so just, that the Years keep equal pace with them, she follows regularly this Exactness, that serves much to the Placing, Understanding and Measure of things; but when it happens they pass from one Year to the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding, the Composure of the Narration broken, and put off till another time, troubles the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and makes Confusion in the Eyes of the Reader; then she conducts to the place where the Narration began, and lets time go on till she finds an Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to overtake and rejoyn him. <hi>Livy, Quintus Curtius</hi> and <hi>Tacitus</hi> have done after this manner; and in this they will be followed by all Lovers of good Order and
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:42879:111"/>
Oeconomy; and who would avoid the like Confusion <hi>Thucydides</hi> fell into, willing to adjust too scrupul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously the Periods of his <hi>History</hi> to those of the <hi>Sun.</hi>

                  <p>THere remains but the <hi>Stile</hi> to be treated of, which is to <hi>History</hi> as Cloaths are to the Body: And to the end a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod may be held in this last Part, I will remass all that can be said of it in five or six Conclusions, grounded upon Authority, Reason and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>History</hi> admits nothing mean in her <hi>Stile,</hi> nothing Negligent or Vulgar: She must have Politeness,
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:42879:112"/>
Adjustment and Dress: So says <hi>Aristotle,</hi> That Compositions to be read, ought to be wrought with more Curiosity and Study, than those to be spoke. 'Tis likewise <hi>Cicero</hi>'s Opinion, who tells us the <hi>Sophist</hi> is allied to the <hi>Historian,</hi> and that the Stile of one and the other is almost the same. <hi>Hermo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genes</hi> also ranks in the same kind the Stile of <hi>History</hi> and that of a <hi>Panegyrick.</hi> And none that has heard speak of <hi>Sophists,</hi> and <hi>Makers</hi> of <hi>Panegyricks,</hi> can be Ignorant of the Magnificence of those People, and the Care they take for Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Dress.</p>
                  <p>But if <hi>Aristotle, Cicero, Hermo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genes,</hi> and the rest, had not recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended Dress, and what is proper for <hi>History,</hi> her Dignity, Employ, and the Quality of Persons she serves, would demand it. She is one of the noblest Productions of Humane Wit; and Nobility is every where remark'd by it. 'Tis what distinguishes Palaces from
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:42879:113"/>
Private Houses; and Gentlemen from the Vulgar: She is designed to instruct the Great; and the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of a Prince ought to be otherwise cloathed than a Petty School-master: All her Discourses are with Kings, Statesmen and Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals: And 'tis not seemly to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in slovenly old Cloaths amongst such Company.</p>
                  <p>I add, A Negligent Use of them without <hi>Artifice,</hi> has little alluring: They must be adjusted, and well put on, to cause Observation. In Houses, Gardens and Garments, a bare Covering does not suffice: And how Profitable soever <hi>History</hi> may be, her Life will be but short, if she has not some Agreement to preserve her from the Outrage of Time. Above sixteen hundred Years <hi>Salust, Livy, Tacitus, Quintus Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius,</hi> and more of the same Age, have lived with Honour, and been magnificently lodg'd, and richly cloathed; whilst others that knew not the Art to please, have been

eaten by Worms and Rats in the corners they were thrown into.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. II. What ought to be the <hi>Ornament</hi> of the <hi>Stile</hi> of <hi>History;</hi> and in what it consists.</head>
                  <p>THE <hi>Stile</hi> of <hi>History</hi> must be adorned; but every sort of <hi>Ornament</hi> is not proper for her. The Dress must be applied to Ages, Conditions and Employs. A Plume of Feathers in the Hat of a Captain, has another <hi>mien,</hi> than in the Cap of a President: And what would become a Girl, would be very ill placed upon her Mother. Though Youth be the Spring of Life, and by consequence the time of Dress, a Young Person must not be seen every day by all in the same Habit: 'Tis the same in the
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:42879:114"/>
Matter we are speaking of, History demands <hi>Ornament,</hi> but not that of a <hi>Ball</hi> or <hi>Theatre.</hi> It must be Ornament of Ceremony, and Holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days, Serious, Grave and Modest; and she would be as ill deck'd up in the Locutions and Figures of <hi>Apuleius,</hi> as if a Grave Lady should go to Church in the Habit of a Comedian.</p>
                  <p>This Ornament then (to say something particular) must not be that of a Country-Wedding, where the new-married Wife is covered all over with Tinsel; 'tis made principally of three things, <hi>Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance of Words, Just Disposition,</hi> and certain <hi>Light from Sentences</hi> and <hi>Figures,</hi> that shine and give <hi>Eclat</hi> to the Composure of the <hi>Stile. Words</hi> are Elegant, that are not of too old or too new a Fabrick; that are receiv'd by Men of Worth, and breath not the common Air. <hi>Disposition</hi> contributes to their Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancy, when they have Number and Measure, that make a Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:42879:114"/>
the Ignorant are not capable of. As to <hi>Sentences,</hi> having al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready discoursed of them, it will be enough to say here, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire Management, where there appears more <hi>Oeconomy</hi> than <hi>Want.</hi> But to shew them to the Reader by certain Marks placed in the Margent, as if afraid they should not be taken notice of, besides the Affectation and Pedantry, is to give Value to ill Wine by the Sign.</p>

                  <p>THE <hi>Sublime Character,</hi> that is to say, the most elivated way of Writing, is of all the most proper for the <hi>Historick Stile</hi>: 'Tis the Opinion of all the Masters, and amongst others <hi>Hermogenes,</hi> as Severe as Judicious a Critick,
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:42879:115"/>
would have an Historian approach as near as possible to that of <hi>Plato</hi>'s, that <hi>Greece</hi> acknowledged for the most Lofty of any; the <hi>M<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ses</hi> also presided in his Academy, and were there adored. And if Verse and Fable were taken from <hi>Homer,</hi> he would not be found more a Poet than this Philosopher. <hi>Thucydides</hi> the Patron of Greek History, form'd himself after this Model: All the Latins of Reputation have followed him; and this Proposition is not less founded upon Reason, than Authority and Example.</p>
                  <p>Every one knows the Stile is as the Cloaths, and Representation as well of Things as Thoughts; and that there ought to be Proportion and Agreement between the Cloaths and the Body, the Representation and Thing represented; That a Childs Coat is not made for a Man, nor <hi>Colossus</hi>'s and Gyants represented by Children. We have said, and 'tis agreed, that nothing ought to enter History but great Things,
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:42879:115"/>
noble Actions, and high Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prises: The Rule of Proportions then and Agreements, will have the Stile with which these Things, Actions and Enterprises are to be cloathed or represented, should ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord with their Grandeur and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altation. An <hi>Historian</hi> that is to represent (for Example) the <hi>Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries</hi> raised against <hi>Rochel,</hi> and the <hi>English</hi> embark'd to Succor it; that has to describe the <hi>Weather, Alps</hi> and <hi>Savoy,</hi> overcome by the late King to the Walls of <hi>Susa,</hi> would be very Ridiculous to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press himself as if he were speaking of a Building made with Cards, or the Attack of a Paper Castle.</p>
                  <p>Let us therefore advise the Writer t<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">

nothing of all this, can but crawl upon the Earth, and work in little, let him leave to others <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story,</hi> that is to be the Instruction of Kings and Princes, and satisfie himself as much as he pleases with writing <hi>Chronicles</hi> and <hi>Legends.</hi> It was said by a great Cardinal, rich in Expressions, That it belonged not to Barbers to play upon the Lute, Beggars to eat Melons, nor Pedants to read <hi>Virgil:</hi> It may be added, Nor those that want the Quill of an Eagle to write <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story.</hi>

                  <head>CHAP. IV. That the <hi>Stile</hi> of <hi>History</hi> ought to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach that of <hi>Poetry;</hi> and to what Degree.</head>
                  <p>THE <hi>Stile</hi> of <hi>History</hi> ought to approach that of <hi>Poetry,</hi> as much as possible for <hi>Prose,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out exceeding the Bounds that se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate them. This Conclusion is founded upon what has been said of their Alliance, and confirm'd by all the Masters, who will have <hi>History</hi> (as I have said before) a <hi>Poem</hi> free from the Confinement of <hi>Versification,</hi> a <hi>Poem</hi> on foot: And if I am permitted to repeat a word worth all has been said, <hi>A Poem in full Song without Musick.</hi> Now the resemblance between Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story and Poetry, that <hi>Agathias</hi> calls <hi>Sisters,</hi> not arising from the Matter feign'd in one, and true in the other, nor from Disposition Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:42879:117"/>
in the one, and Artificial in the other, it must necessarily arise from the <hi>Stile.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>'Tis for that <hi>Dion. Halicar.</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves he Honours <hi>Thucydides</hi> and <hi>Herodotus,</hi> where he gives their Histories the name of Excellent and Delicate <hi>Poems.</hi> And in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place, expressing himself like a Master upon this Doctrine, he condemns in History a Slovenly ill-comb'd Stile: These are his words, <hi>And would have her have one studied, approaching the Poetick.</hi> All the <hi>Latins</hi> of the first Rank, have not been less Curious in this than the <hi>Greeks.</hi> And <hi>Pontin,</hi> a worthy and ingenious Writer, has taken great Pleasure in comparing many places of <hi>Virgil,</hi> with the like in <hi>Salust</hi> and <hi>Livy,</hi> where Verse excepted, the <hi>Poet</hi> is not more so, than these two <hi>Historians.</hi> And there are places enough, where <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citus</hi> otherwise so <hi>Serious,</hi> and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times so <hi>Chagrin,</hi> forgets the Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity of his Office, and takes upon
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:42879:117"/>
him the <hi>Enthusiasm</hi> of an <hi>Heroick Poet.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But the <hi>Historian</hi> must have a care of deceiving himself, and know the Permission given <hi>History</hi> of coming near to <hi>Poetry,</hi> is not a bold License without reserve. There are <hi>Locutions</hi> and <hi>Figures</hi> he must avoid with as much care, as a Vertuous Woman abstains all things that offend her Modesty. What would be thought of a <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story</hi> beginning in these Terms, <hi>The Hours that attend upon the Sun, had not as yet opened the Gates of Heaven:</hi> Or thus, Aurora <hi>had not as yet appeared in the Balcony of</hi> Laque <hi>and</hi> Azure, <hi>placed upon the Portico of the Palace of Day:</hi> Or by these words, <hi>The Fiery-footed Coursers that draw the Chariot of the Sun, were still in the Ocean, and the Beautiful Driver had not as yet put on their Harnass of Gold and Rubies:</hi> And all this to express it was not yet day: People would laugh at such a Luxury of Speech, such a
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:42879:118"/>
Magnificence of words ill placed: And what would be an Ornament and Rich in Poetry, would pass but for a <hi>Turlupinade</hi> in <hi>History.</hi> There is here then a Distinction to be made between Defect and Excess, a Draght and a Flood: Some would have the Composure of <hi>History</hi> low and mean like <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gends</hi>; others would have her have the <hi>Theban</hi> and <hi>Pharsalian Heat</hi> and <hi>Enthusiasm:</hi> But the one allows not enough, the other too much; the middle way must be held, and <hi>Lucian</hi>'s Rule observed.</p>
                  <p>In the <hi>Historick Character,</hi> he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguishes a <hi>Sentence</hi> from the <hi>Stile</hi>; and this presupposed, he permits a <hi>Sentence</hi> (chiefly in certain De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scriptions that have something great) to make use of this Heat, to follow the Gale of Poetry, and ride on Horse-back, so he expresses him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self: But to the <hi>Stile</hi> he gives no such Liberty, recommends Reserved<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Modesty, and forbids Words and Expressions that look
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:42879:118"/>
like <hi>Possession.</hi> He will have her go after a <hi>Sentence,</hi> not on Horse-back behind her but on Foot, and holding her Stirrups: These are yet his Words; and by these, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his manner, always great and figured, he represents the <hi>Medium</hi> ought to be held by the <hi>Historian</hi> between the <hi>Orator</hi> and <hi>Poet.</hi>

                  <p>LET the <hi>Ornament</hi> be what it will, with which the <hi>Stile</hi> of <hi>History</hi> is adorned, she will not have all the Grace she ought, if she has not three Qualities, <hi>Purity, Clarity</hi> and <hi>Brevity,</hi> in every thing. What is free from Mixture is called <hi>Pure</hi>; and the Stile of Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:42879:119"/>
will be such, when it has no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing Strange or Barbarous; of another Time or Place, Usage or Mode; and that all the Rules of Grammar are observed. This <hi>Purity,</hi> whether writ or spoke, expresses a Person of Quality, and it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be wanted, without being taxed with lowness of Birth or ill Breeding.</p>
                  <p>'Tis of this <hi>Pureness</hi> our <hi>French Theophrast</hi> Monsieur <hi>de la Chamber</hi> must be understood, when he would have (as he has often told me) History writ in the Stile of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain little <hi>Romances,</hi> that have lately appeared under the Title of <hi>Novels.</hi> As he has not less Esteem for <hi>Thu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cydides</hi> and <hi>Livy,</hi> than <hi>Aristotle</hi> and <hi>Hippocrates</hi>; I am well assured he would not be the first to accuse them for having ill employ'd the Treasure of their Wit, and it would be without doubt to accuse them to rob History of the Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments they have given her, and reduce her to I know not what
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:42879:119"/>
sort of Purity, without Colour, Relish and Force.</p>
                  <p>He cannot be Ignorant (who is of the first Rank of <hi>Philosophers</hi>) that the <hi>Forms</hi> must differ accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the difference of the <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi> That the Materials of a lofty History, being different from that of a little Love-Story, the way of working them must also be diverse. 'Tis with the Purity of the Stile, as with the Property of the Habit, it may be comly throughout, but requires the same Adjustment and Care in all places. That that would be too much for <hi>Sylvia</hi> or <hi>Amarillis</hi>; would be too little for <hi>Semiramis</hi> or <hi>Cleopatra.</hi> And who dares maintain, the Stile that suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices a Letter, Love-Declaration, or other Trifle of that nature, can admit, the Harangue of a General encouraging his Soldiers to Fight; or the Head of a Faction inciting a Mutiny; a Statesman giving his Opinion of the Consequence of War or Peace; or the Description
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:42879:120"/>
of a Battle, Sedition, Sack of a Town, Burning or Shipwrack of a whole Fleet: Such things must be expressed in other Terms, than the Despair of <hi>Celadon,</hi> or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints of <hi>Astrea.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I will give you an Example, The great Doctor in the Art of Loving, who said every Lover was a Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier, and Love, as well as <hi>Mars,</hi> had his Camps and Armies; yet knew the Trumpet was as little proper for the one, as the Flagalet for the other. Besides he never spoke of War, but in Terms High and Magnifick; nor of Love, but in Words Soft and Smooth to the last Degree of Delicacy. And though his Stile be every where Pure, and his Locution <hi>Roman</hi> throughout, yet when he has in his Metamor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phose, the Chaos or Deluge under his Hand, when he is to describe the Birth of the World, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bats of Gyants, the Universal Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrack of Mankind, he expresses himself with quite another Force;
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:42879:120"/>
without leaving his Purity, speaks in quite another Tone, than he does in his <hi>Elegies</hi> and <hi>Love-Epistles.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This, to Interpret our Dear and Knowing Friend, who as a great Lover and Artist in the Pureness of a Stile, would be but under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood, that of all Ornaments he most esteemed Purity. We esteem it as much as he, and I am sure he intends with us it ought to be accompanied with the Force, Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and Elevation the Nobleness of History demands.</p>
                  <p>Let us proceed to <hi>Clearness,</hi> which is the second Quality required in the <hi>Stile</hi> of <hi>History.</hi> It may be made by the neatness of Words, that ought to be all Intellible, and placed in so good Order, as not to evade, hinder or trouble the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding of the Reader, from joyning with that of the Writer, and taking all the Fineness of his Thoughts. It may be made in the second place more Advantagiously, and in a more Noble Manner, by
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:42879:121"/>
certain Lights that pass from the Intellect of the Author to his Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination, and penetrating the Images they there find, carry them bright as they are into his Stile; from whence they easily reflect by the Sight or Hearing into the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding, according to the Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of those that Hear or Read. This sort of Clearness is the most Grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and Esteemed, but very Rare, and comes but from some Illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated Wits of the first Rate, that enlighten their Works by their own proper Lustre, and hold the same Order and Rank as the <hi>Planets</hi> amongst the <hi>Stars.</hi>

                  <p>THere remains but <hi>Brevity,</hi> that is a great Agreement to History, and a great Charm to the Reader: But how few know in what this agreeable Shortness consists; many place it in the Management and Sparing of words, and perswade themselves, than to write in few, is to be short. Not knowing there are <hi>Madrigals</hi> of six Verses, longer than <hi>Poems</hi> of twelve thousand. <hi>Harangues</hi> of a quarter of an Hour, shorter than some <hi>Complements</hi> of four Lines. Others establish it in a cut or broken Stile, that is, without Band or Connexion, that falls and rises, begins and finishes in every Line. Father <hi>Matthew</hi> has given the first
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:42879:122"/>
Example of this manner of Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Speaking by Bits; and as ill Examples are usually most fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, this <hi>Jargon</hi> was in Mode during the Minority of the late King. And a certain Soldier of <hi>Rovergue</hi> or <hi>Perygort</hi> was made Publick with the Language of a Frantick; and put himself at the Head of a Band of such who thought to give themselves Honour by a Madness like his. When the <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules</hi> of <hi>Seneca,</hi> and <hi>Orlando</hi> of <hi>Ariosto<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> as Furious as they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented, speak better Sence than those People. And the <hi>Corribantes</hi> of the Ancients, when the Wine had turned their Heads, play'd the Extravagants more reasonably and with more Followers. But my Wonder is, <hi>Malvezzi,</hi> other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise so Worthy a Man, and others of his Country, should pass the <hi>Alps</hi> and come into <hi>France,</hi> on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose to take this Infection.</p>
                  <p>This <hi>Brevity</hi> then we search after, is not made by Hashing of <hi>Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences,</hi>
                     <pb n="221" facs="tcp:42879:122"/>
and maiming of <hi>Words.</hi> And those that take <hi>Salust</hi> and <hi>Tacitus</hi> for Patrons, are mistaken, and chose those that condemn them. For though in some Descriptions, where these great Men affecting to make haste, they serve themselves with some Infinitives without Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctive Particles, a Privilege their Language gives them; yet in all the rest their Stile is conformable to the Masters Rules, that will have it go roundly and with an equal Course; like that of a River, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out stop or turning by the Declen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Canal. On the other side, As <hi>History</hi> is a <hi>Structure,</hi> she demands Order and Connexion as all other Buildings; and her Mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials without that, would make but a tumultuous Heap of Sand without Lime.</p>
                  <p>There are others that place <hi>Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity</hi> in <hi>Constraint,</hi> and think they are short whenever they <hi>pinch</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in; when they have remass'd many things in few Words. These
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:42879:123"/>
deceive themselves, if they would have the Shoe less than the Foot, and the Habit too strait for the Body; for thereby the Foot becomes not more Noble, nor the Body better shap'd. But from being better made, or more at their Ease, they find themselves lam'd, and suffer the Torture. Everything has its Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, and whether above, or below this Measure, as there is neither Agreement nor Harmony, so no Beauty nor Pleasure must be sought after, but what arises from it.</p>
                  <p>This <hi>Brevity,</hi> where the <hi>Matter</hi> is shortned, as Hangings folded up, and Beds piled one upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in a Wardrobe; is not the Shortness History requires; she per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits not things to be hid, and shewn by pieces; will neither have them too much extended, nor too closely press'd, without being lamed or dislocated; that spoils the Figure, and offends the Sight. And 'tis in this properly consists the <hi>Historick Shortness,</hi> to expose nothing that
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:42879:123"/>
may be suppressed without Injury to the Subject; to Suppress nothing that belongs to the Integrity or Beauty of it; not to take off the Sight, till every thing has the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tension it demands; to remember that never so little added, though but a Line, is a Volume. This is the Opinion of all the Masters, of <hi>Cicero,</hi> who allows a Narration its <hi>Agreement:</hi> And the Sight alone, (without Reason) teaches us, there is no Beauty where there is want of Extension, and things heaped are in disorder; of <hi>Quintilian,</hi> that condemns the Leanness and Driness of a Narration, and declares, That what is not of just Measure, is but Confusion; of <hi>Plato</hi> that tells us, Shortness and Length have no Merit in themselves; and not the most short, but what is best must be chosen.</p>
                  <p>I will finish by these Oracles, not so Equivocal or Deceitful as those of <hi>Delph:</hi> Nor can I add any thing will give greater Value, or end this
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:42879:124"/>
Treatise with an Authority of greater Weight or better Esteem. However I will not quit my Pen, till I have again acquainted the Reader, that what I have said of the Historian, I have said of a Man not yet born, nor will not appear, but in that Year that discovers the Perpetual Motion, and Philosophers Stone.</p>
