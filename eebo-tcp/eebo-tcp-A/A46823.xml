            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>A HELP FOR THE UNDERSTANDING OF THE HOLY SCRIPTURE.</p>

               <hi>Containing certain ſhort notes of expoſition upon the five books of Moſes, to wit,</hi> Geneſis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, <hi>and</hi> Deuteronomie: <hi>Wherein</hi> First, all ſuch paſſages in the Text are explained as were thought likely to be questioned by any Reader of ordinary capacity; Secondly, in many clauſes thoſe things are diſcovered which are need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and uſefull to be known, and not ſo eaſily at the firſt reading obſerved; and Thirdly, many places that might at firſt ſeem to contradict one another are reconciled.</p>

            <p>It is now above twenty years ſince the Lord was pleaſed to open a doore unto me for the preaching of the Goſpelof Chriſt amongſt you, wherein, though with much weakneſſe, I have endeavoured to the utmoſt of my power, I bleſſe God, to build you up in the knowledge of God and of Chriſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and need no other witneſſes then yourſelves, that <hi>I have not ſought yours but you,</hi> as having indeed from my firſt entrance amongſt you reſolved with the Apoſtle, <hi>very gladly to ſpend, and to be spent for you, though the more abundantly I loved you the leſſe I were loved by you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:103385:3"/>
Amongſt other wayes wherein I have ſtudied to be ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable to your ſouls, it pleaſed God to put into my heart that I would undertake the unfolding of ſuch paſſages of the holy Scripture as were ſomewhat more difficult and obſcure to ſuch as would come in and partake of my labours therein; and the end I propounded to my ſelf in this was, both that I my ſelf might hereby be the better enabled in publick alſo to declare unto you the whole counſell of God, as occaſion was offered; and that you likewiſe might with the more advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage and comfort exerciſe your ſelves in your private reading of thoſe ſacred volumes.</p>
            <p>Now having for ſeverall years ſpent ſome time every Lords day in this imploiment, I was at length importuned by ſome friends, that were partakers of my labours therein, to prepare thoſe Annotations for the Preſſe, which were the chief ſubſtance of that which I had collected for that ſervice. They alledged what ſatisfaction and comfort themſelves had received in the hearing of them, and what an advantage it might be both to them and others, if they might have them ready at hand at all times to inform them in any thing they ſcrupled in their private reading; and ſo farre I was ſwayed with what they ſaid, that I reſolved in the publiſhing of one part of them to make triall whether they would find that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation and welcome abroad, that might give encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to ſend <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Theſe indeed come forth in a ſad time, when arms are in farre more requeſt then books; but we muſt herein ſubmit to the good will of God. It hath fared with this Book in this, as with many a traveller that hath prepared for a journey when the ſunne ſhined fair, and yet was conſtrained at laſt to go forth in a ſtorm. When I began firſt to tranſcribe theſe

Notes for the Preſſe the skie was clear and ſhined upon us, and yet now when they ſhould go forth, the whole kingdome is overſpread with a cloud, that is like to poure down ſhowrs of bloud upon the whole land: the Lord give us grace to turn to him, who hath promiſed to be <hi>a refuge from the storm.</hi> Well, but yet the book being paſſed the Preſſe, and being withall to go upon Gods buſineſſe, I was unwilling to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear the publiſhing of it, eſpecially when I began to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, that the drift of it was to help men to reade the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture with profit, and that there is never more need for men to be much in ſtudying Gods word then in troubleſome and ſad times, God having there ſtored up thoſe cordialls for us which in ſuch times muſt chear up the ſick fainting ſpirits of his poore afflicted ſervants: <hi>unleſſe thy Law had been my delight,</hi> ſaith David, Pſal. 119. 92. <hi>I then had periſhed in my afflictions.</hi> Having therefore reſolved to publiſh it, and to leave the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe to the good providence of God, I here preſent it to you in the firſt place, to whom it doth of right belong. If it may prove a means to bring you, whoſe ſouls God hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to my charge, to be in love with the Scripture, or adde any thing to your ſtock of knowledge and grace, I have if not all, yet my chief deſire. <hi>Now our Lord Jeſus Chriſt himſelf, and God even our father, which hath loved us, and hath given us everlasting conſolation and good hope through grace, comfort your hearts and stabliſh you in every good word and work.</hi> And ſo I commend you to Gods grace, and deſire likewiſe your prayers unto God for him who is</p>

But for the preſent I could onely tranſcribe for the Preſſe this firſt part, upon the five books of Moſes; and beſides, I am deſirous to ſee what approbation this may find amongst thoſe whoſe judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment may be farre better then mine own, before I would adventure to ſend forth the rest.</p>
            <p>There are onely two particulars wherein I ſhall need to give ſatisfaction
<pb facs="tcp:103385:4"/>
for what I have done. First, I have not at all meddled with the many doubts t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>at have been raiſed by Interpreters concerning the different wayes of tranſlating ſome paſſages in the Originall Text, but have onely endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to unfold the meaning of the Text according to our laſt Tranſlation; one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly I have for the moſt part taken in that reading alſo which is added in the margin of our Bibles. If there be any man that stumbles at this, I deſire him to conſider that I intended this work chiefly for thoſe that onely under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand their own language, and ſuch knotty diſputes concerning the Originall must needs have mightily puzzled ſuch readers, but could never have been any way profitable for them. And this I truſt will ſatisfie him.</p>
            <p>Again, having made uſe of many learned Expoſitours, in ſearching out the meaning of thoſe places that I have undertaken to explain, ſome may perhaps wiſh that I had ſome way inſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Many of our beſt Expoſitours, and that not without good probabilitie, conceive theſe words to be a generall propoſition concerning the whole creation (which is afterwards more particularly unfolded, by ſetting down in what time, and in what order and manner this was done, and what were the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall works of the ſix dayes;) to wit, <hi>That in the beginning God created the heaven and the earth,</hi> that is, that all things were at firſt created by God, <hi>the heavens, &amp; the earth, and all the hoſt of them,</hi> as it is afterwards expreſſed chap. 2. 1. or <hi>the world, and all therein,</hi> as S. Paul ſpake, Act. 17. 24. This Moſes affirmeth here in the firſt verſe; but then how, after what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and in what order they were created, that is afterwards related in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing part of the chapter. Yet others again (&amp; that I think moſt probably) underſtand this which is here ſaid, to be the work of the firſt dayes creation, to wit, that God in the beginning, on the firſt day, created <hi>the heaven,</hi> that is, the higheſt heaven, the dwelling place of the Angels, called <hi>the heaven of heavens,</hi> 1. King. 8. 27. and <hi>the earth,</hi> that whole confuſed Chaos of earth and water, which was as yet without form and void, as it is afterwards deſcribed in the ſecond verſe. And indeed becauſe it is ſaid, Job 38. 6, 7. <hi>that the morning ſtarres ſang together, and the ſonnes of God ſhouted for joy, when God laid the foundations of the earth,</hi> which is meant of the Angels; it ſeems moſt probable, that this higheſt heaven, and ſo the Angels together with it, were firſt created, and ſo was a main part of the work of the firſt day. It is true, there is no mention made of the angels, neither here, nor in any other part of the chapter; but that is, becauſe Moſes purpoſely intended to relate

onely the creation of things corporall and viſible, &amp; that happily as having regard therein to the rudeneſſe and weakneſſe of that infant-Church of the Jews, for whom he wrote this hiſtory. For that the angels were at firſt created by God of nothing, as all other things were, is evident by many other places of Scripture, as Pſal. 104. 4. <hi>Who maketh his angels ſpirits.</hi> Col. 1. 16. <hi>By him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth, viſible, and inviſible,</hi> &amp;c. Pſal. 148. 2<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 5. <hi>Praiſe ye him all his angels, let them praiſe the name of the Lord, for he commanded, and they were created.</hi> And though we cannot expreſly ſay, on which of the ſix dayes the angels were created, becauſe there is no expreſſe mention made of them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet it is moſt likely that they were created together with the higheſt heavens, the chief place of their habitation; and that on the firſt day, becauſe then at the laying of the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of the earth the angels did praiſe their Creatour, as was before noted, Job 38.</p>

               <q>And darkneſſe was upon the face of the deep.]</q>

               <q>And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.]</q>
               <p>The word here tranſlated <hi>moved,</hi> is metaphoricall, taken from the motion of birds, that flutter over their young, and implies that the holy Ghoſt did ſuſtain and cheriſh this Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>os, or Deep, by his ſecret, but effectuall power and motion, even as birds do their new-hatcht young ones, by ſo fluttering over them.</p>

                  <hi>The evening,</hi> which is the beginning of the night, and <hi>the morning,</hi> which is the beginning of the day, are here put for the whole time of night and day, which joyned together are ſaid to make one entire day, to wit, in a large ſenſe comprehending both night and day, which is with us the ſpace of 24 houres: whereas the time whiles the light ſhineth is the <hi>day</hi> ſtrictly taken, in which ſenſe Chriſt ſaith, <hi>There are twelve houres in the day,</hi> John 11. 9.

                  <bibl>Verſ. 6.</bibl> And God ſaid, Let there be a firmament in the midſt of the waters, &amp;c.</q>
               <p>The firmament God called <hi>Heaven,</hi> verſ. 8. It is called in the Hebrew <hi>an expan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,</hi> or <hi>ſtretching forth,</hi> becauſe the Heavens are ſtretched forth as a curtain. Iſai. 40. 22. God <hi>ſtretcheth forth the heavens as a curtain, and ſpreadeth them out as a tent to dwell in:</hi> and in Greek, Latine, and Engliſh <hi>a firmament;</hi> becauſe of the conſtant and enduring firmneſſe of it which is not worn with its continuall motion, but remaineth ſuch as it was framed of God in the beginning. So that by <hi>the firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> here is meant, whatſoever is contained in that vaſt ſpace from the ſurface of the earth, to the uppermoſt heavens, with the Regions of the aire and the heavenly Orbs, &amp;c. Now of this firmament it is ſaid, that it was made <hi>in the midst of the waters,</hi> and that <hi>to divide the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament;</hi> and from hence many learned men have concluded, that doubtleſſe a great part of thoſe waters that did at firſt cover the face of the deep were on this day lifted up by the almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty command of God, above all the heavenly orbs comprehended under this word <hi>firmament,</hi> and ſo there continue ſtill as in the place appointed them of God, and are ſpread as an orb of water round about the higheſt part of the viſible heavens. But becauſe the main reaſon whereon they ground this opinion is, that by the words of Moſes they ſay it is plain, that the whole firmament muſt be <hi>in the midſt of the waters,</hi> and muſt divide <hi>the waters</hi> that are beneath <hi>from the waters</hi> that are above;

But the words will not bear this expoſition; and there are many reaſons be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that do evidently enough diſcover that God did from the firſt creation appoint that the ſeventh day ſhould be kept as a holy Sabbath: as 1.

Becauſe it is no way probable that the Church had for ſo many ages before the giving of the Law no ſet day ſet apart for holy imployments. What though there be no mention made in the Scriptures of the Patriarchs keeping a Sabbath? Many things they did which are not mentioned: and how could the diſtinction of ſeverall weeks be kept till the Law? yea, how could they have known the weekly ſeventh day from the creation, if it had not been conſtantly kept from the Creation till that time? 3.

               <p>The ſerpent, ſpeechleſſe in himſelf, had his mouth opened by Satan, who cauſed him to ſpeak, or ſpake in and by him, as the Lord by an angel opened the mouth of Balaams aſſe.

               <p>Some Expoſitours conceive that the fruit of the tree of life being eaten by man ſhould have prevented all decay of naturall ſtrength, and have made him immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall, or at leaſt have kept him in perfect health and ſtrength untill he was taken up from earth into heaven; and that either by means of a created power and efficacy, which to this end and purpoſe God had given to this fruit, or by an extraordinary and ſupernaturall bleſſing, which God had ordained ſhould go along with the eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this fruit: and hence they ſay it was that when Adam and Eve had ſinned, God now reſolved to turn them out of Paradiſe that they might not taſte of the tree of life, either in mercy, to prevent their living for ever in miſery; or in judgement, that the curſe of Death which God had threatned as the reward of ſinne might not be prevented by eating of this fruit.

The true reaſon why the Lord caſt Adam out of Paradiſe to prevent his eating of the tree of life, was doubtleſſe that having by his diſobedience and ſinne made himſelf liable to death, he might not now meddle with this ſacramentall ſeal of life and ſalvation, which now becauſe of ſinne he had nothing to do with: Onely as before the Lord had upbraided them for their vain affectation of being like unto him in that ironicall expreſſion, <hi>Behold the man is become as one of us to know good and evil,</hi> meaning that by his ſinne they were become moſt unlike him; ſo in theſe words ironically he upbraids him after the ſame manner for that certainty of death he had brought upon himſelf, determining to caſt him out of the garden of Eden, <hi>Leſt</hi> (ſaith the Lord) <hi>he put forth his hand and take alſo of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever;</hi> not becauſe there was any danger of his living for ever, but in deriſion of any ſuch hope or expectation, if happily he ſhould entertain any ſuch motion, as formerly of gaining an increaſe of knowledge by eating of the tree of knowledge of good and evil.</p>

if we take the hills of Taurus or Caucaſus between the Eaſt Indies and Scythia to be thoſe mountains of Ararat, where the Ark reſted (for ſo ſome conceive) then this place is clear; for they lie Eaſtward from the land of Chaldea, here called <hi>the land of Shinar:</hi> If we retain the common opinion, that thoſe mountains of Ararat were the hills of Armenia, we muſt conceive that they had removed formerly from the place where the Ark reſted, and ſettled themſelves in ſome countrey that lay Eaſt of Chaldea, and thence turned again Weſtward, and planted themſelves in this place.</p>

                  <bibl>Verſ. 1.</bibl> THe Lord came unto Abram in a viſion.]</q>
               <p>By this word <hi>viſion,</hi> is ſometimes meant a Revelation of God given to his ſervants in their ſleep by a dream, which are alſo for diſtinction ſake called <hi>nightly viſions,</hi> Gen. 46. 2. <hi>And God ſpake unto Iſrael in the viſions of the night:</hi> but this I cannot conceive to be ſuch, chiefly becauſe we have ſuch a viſion afterwards following this, verſ. 12. <hi>A deep ſleep fell upon Abram, and lo an horrour,</hi> &amp;c. Again, by <hi>viſions,</hi> are ſometimes meant thoſe apparitions which the ſervants of God have had being caſt into a trance, which were onely ſpirituall objects of the mind, not of the bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſenſe: This ſeems not to be ſuch neither; for many things are here ſaid to have paſſed betwixt God and Abram, which cannot well be thought to have been onely in a trance, and not really done, as the <hi>killing and dividing of the heifer of three years old,</hi> &amp;c. verſ. 9, 10. and beſides, there would not have been then ſo great difference betwixt this viſion, and that dream or trance mentioned verſ. 12. and therefore I rather conceive this viſion to have been an open apparition, which A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bram beheld waking with the eyes of his body, though happely the Lord appeared in a more glorious manner then uſually; and therefore it is now added, that this was done in a viſion.</p>
               <q>Fear not Abram, &amp;c.]</q>
               <p>This is ſpoken both that he might not be afraid of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty of God, who now in this viſion appeared to him; and alſo to comfort him in regard of that fear and trouble of mind wherewith he was oppreſſed, in regard that after ſo many promiſes from God he continued ſtill childleſſe, as appeareth by his anſwer; and happely alſo to chear him up againſt the fear of thoſe kings he had vanquiſhed, who might now threaten revenge; and therefore God tells him that he would be <hi>a ſhield</hi> to him to defend him againſt his enemies.</p>

                  <bibl>Verſ. 2.</bibl> And the ſteward of my houſe is this Eliezer of Damaſcus.]</q>
               <p>Abram doth not herein complain that <hi>Eliezer of Damaſcus,</hi> that is, who was born of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents of Damaſcus, was his ſteward; but that he had no other ſtay of his houſe, that is, that he being childleſſe wanted the comfort which other fathers had, he had not a ſonne under him the guide and ſtay of his family, but all was in the hands of a ſervant at preſent, and would be enjoyed by him, he being dead, for want of an heir.</p>
               <q>
                  <bibl>Verſ. 3.</bibl> And Abram ſaid, Lo, one born in my houſe is mine heir.]</q>
               <p>The ſumme of this complaint is onely thus much; That he had no other heir in his houſe, none to inherit that which he had, but onely his home-born ſervant, (for we need not
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:103385:23" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſuppoſe that Abram had adopted any ſervant and made him his heire) which Abram here bewails as one perplexed betwixt hope and fear, not as rejecting the promiſes of God concerning his ſeed, but as commending to God his ſad eſtate and conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and intimating his deſire that God would at length remember the promiſe he had made to him, and ſend him an heir.</p>
               <q>
                  <bibl>Verſ. 5.</bibl> And he brought him forth abroad, &amp;c.]</q>
               <p>This therefore was done when the ſtarres might be ſeen, either early in the morning (and if ſo, then was there a whole day ſpent, as there might well be, in thoſe paſſages afterward rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted) or elſe in the evening; and then it is here related beforehand, not in the order of time wherein it was done: for afterwards Moſes ſpeaks of what was done at ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſetting, verſ. 17. <hi>And it came to paſſe, that when the ſunne went down, and it was dark,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <q>
                  <bibl>Verſ. 9.</bibl> And he ſaid, Take me an heifer, &amp;c.]</q>
               <p>God appoints theſe things to be thus done, partly as a ſacrifice to be offered to him, partly that they might be as ſignes of the covenant which he now makes with Abram; for, becauſe it was the manner of men when they made a ſolemn covenant to cut beaſts in twain, and to paſſe between the parts thereof, as it were wiſhing the like to themſelves if they brake the covenant, Jer. 34. 18. <hi>And I will give</hi> (to wit, into their enemies hands) <hi>the men that have tranſgreſſed my covenant, which have not performed the words of the covenant, which they had made before me, when they cut the calf in twain, and paſſed between the parts thereof;</hi> therefore is the Lord pleaſed to uſe the ſame manner here with Abram.</p>

               <p>That is, <hi>from the river Sihor unto the great river Euphrates.</hi> Some think that by <hi>the river of Egypt</hi> here Nilus is meant: but becauſe we reade not that ever the Dominion of the Iſraelites reached ſo farre, and elſewhere in deſcribing the bounds of this land, to wit, Joſh. 13. 3. the river <hi>Sihor</hi> is mentioned as <hi>the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of Egypt,</hi> and Jer. 2. 18. <hi>Sihor</hi> and <hi>Euphrates</hi> are as here oppoſed one againſt the other, <hi>What haſt thou to do in the way of Egypt to drink the waters of Sihor, or what haſt thou to do in the way of Aſſyria to drink the waters of the river?</hi> that is, <hi>Euphrates,</hi> called by way of eminency <hi>the river;</hi> therefore moſt probably it is thought that by <hi>the river of Egypt</hi> Sihor is meant.

               <p>This is principally ſpoken concerning Iſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mael, but in a ſecond place concerning his poſteritie alſo.

                  </gap>ound by experience that the eye of God did watch over her for good; and this ſhe expreſſeth by way of an interrogation, the better to ſet forth the joy of her heart, <hi>Have I alſo here looked after him that ſeeth me?</hi> as if ſhe ſhould have ſaid, How can I enough wonder at this favour, that the Lord Jehovah, whoſe eye doth ever behold me, ſhould afford me the honour to behold him, even me that am a poore bondmaid, and that here in the wilderneſſe, when I was run away from my miſtris, yea and that I ſhould ſee him too without perill to my life, being ſtill alive after I have ſeen the Lord my God, and ſo able to <hi>look after him.</hi> And indeed this phraſe which ſhe uſeth, <hi>of looking after him,</hi> ſeemeth to have reference to her gazing after him when he aſcended up from her; and by this phraſe, it is likely ſhe expreſſeth her beholding God rather then by any other, becauſe at his departing he manifeſted his glory more then before, which made her gaze after him: as the angel did to Gedeon, and therefore it is ſaid that when the angel departed <hi>Gedeon perceived that he was an angel of the Lord: And Gedeon ſaid, Alas O Lord God: for becauſe I have ſeen an angel of the Lord face to face,</hi> Judges 6. 22. &amp; Chriſt at his aſcenſion, which made the angels ſay, <hi>Ye men of Galilee, why ſtand ye gazing up into heaven?</hi> Acts 1. 11. This I conceive is the plain meaning of this place.

               <p>Becauſe ſhe deemed it ſo unlikely, if not impoſſible, that ſhe ſhould now have a child, ſhe did inwardly laugh at what ſhe heard ſpoken. <hi>She laughed within her ſelf,</hi> ſhe did not break out into loud and open laughter, but was inwardly affected as thoſe uſe to be that laugh at any thing related, which they deſire but cannot believe it will ever be: and this concerning the ſecrecy of her laughter, that it was <hi>within her ſelf,</hi> is thus parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly expreſſed, to intimate, 1. Why ſhe did ſo readily deny it, becauſe it was indeed an invvard ſmiling rather then an outvvard direct laughter, and ſuch as could not therefore by others be heard or diſcerned; 2. Why ſhe vvas afraid vvhen he took notice of it, to vvit, becauſe ſhe began novv to conceive that doubtleſſe he vvas more then man that could diſcern the invvard affections of her heart.

               <p>Queſtionleſſe this proſfer of Lots was unwarranta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and ſinfull: for though in evils of puniſhment we may chuſe a leſſe to avoid a greater, yet in the evils of ſinne all choice is unlawfull: if we may not <hi>do evil that good may come of it,</hi> Rom. 3. 8. much leſſe may we do any evil to prevent others from doing ſome greater evil. It would not have been lawfull for Lots daughters to have yielded themſelves to have been defiled by theſe varlets, thereby to have taken them off from that fouler ſinne of Sodomy, which they had reſolved upon; much leſſe was it lawfull for him to reſolve that he would bring them forth and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver them up to the luſt of this rabble, that they might do what they liſt to them: for he had no ſuch power over his daughters, eſpecially if he had already eſpouſed them to husbands, though they were not married, as many Expoſitours think he had. But yet it was no wonder at all that Lot, though a <hi>righteous man</hi> 2. Pet. 2. 7. and highly beloved of God, ſhould thus forget himſelf, conſidering 1. that in ſuch a ſudden diſturbance cauſed by the fear of ſuch a horrid villany ſo violently purſued, he could ſcarce have ſo much liberty as to ponder any thing that came into his mind; 2. that his zealous care for preſerving his gueſts againſt ſuch a horrid wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſſe might ſo farre tranſport him as to make him on a ſudden judge it better to yield to any thing then to give way to their deteſtable deſires; and 3. that he might deceive himſelf with a vain hope that in this ſtrange proffer made by a father they would reade ſo much of the grievous diſtraction of his mind, as would make them relent, and neither deſire what he had proffered, nor proſecute what they had at firſt deſired.</p>

               <p>By this it may appear that Lot had not onely grieved inwardly and <hi>vexed his righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſoul with the unclean converſation of theſe wicked men,</hi> but had alſo, as occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion was offered, reproved them for their wickedneſſe, and done what he could to teach them better, and to diſſwade them from thoſe lewd courſes, which were other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe likely to bring Gods judgement upon them; and hence it is that they now twit him with taking upon him to be a judge amongſt them, and with thinking (a ſtranger though he were) to govern them and to order them in every thing as he pleaſed.</p>

They take the periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of their ſiſters in Sodom, to be a puniſhment of God upon them for their mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying with the wicked Sodomites; not daring to do ſo therefore, and grieving by this means to be deprived of the common bleſſing of mankind, they reſolve upon a more wicked courſe. But I rather conceive thus of the place: Lot and his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters flying in ſome great fear into the mountain, and being there in a manner mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red up in a cave, his eldeſt daughter utters theſe words as a complaint that by this ſolitary life they were deprived of all hope of marriage (the common bleſſing of all the earth) <hi>There is not a man in the earth to come in unto us:</hi> That is, here we live in a cave without ſociety of any but our ſelves, and it is to us all one, as if there were not a man upon the earth; <hi>Come let us make our father drink wine,</hi> &amp;c.

               <p>They are called Prophets in the Scripture to whom the Lord did more familiarly reveal his will, then to other men, and by whom he did teach and inſtruct others: Such was Abraham, Gen. 18. 17, 18, 19. <hi>And the Lord ſaid, Shall I hide from Abraham that thing which I do? ſeeing that Abraham ſhall ſurely become a great nation, &amp;c. For I know that he will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand his children and his houſhold after him,</hi> &amp;c. And of this the Lord gives no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice to Abimelech, 1. That he might not dare to detain Sarah, becauſe her husband was not an ordinary man, but a Prophet, one in ſpeciall favour with God, whoſe wrongs God would ſurely avenge, Pſal. 105. 15. <hi>Touch not mine Anoynted, and do my Prophets no harm;</hi> 2. That he might hope by his prayers (being a man ſo prevalent with God) to have the plague removed that was laid upon them.</p>

               <p>He addes, to excuſe himſelf, that it was not altogether falſe which he had faid, becauſe it was true in a ſenſe, that ſhe was his ſiſter (as in the ſame ſenſe Lot and he are called <hi>brethren,</hi> Gen. 13. 8. <hi>For we be brethren)</hi> namely, becauſe ſhe was <hi>the daughter of his father, though not of his mother:</hi> And for the clearing this, the Hebrews hold that Sarah was that Iſcah, the daughter of Haran, Abrahams brother, as being the ſonne of Terah, though by another woman; for this being yielded, ſhe was indeed the grandchild of Terah, Abrahams father, and ſo might be called <hi>the daughter of his father</hi> (as Jethroes daughters are called Revels, who was their grandfather, Exod. 2. 18.) and yet withall not be <hi>the daughter of his mother,</hi> becauſe deſcended from the former of Terahs wives, whereas Abraham was born of a latter wife.</p>

               <p>This place is diverſly tranſlated, and accordingly there are ſeverall expoſitions given of it, but according to this tranſlation of ours, the meaning muſt needs be this; Abimelech puts her in mind that her husband ought to be as a veil unto her, to cover her as it were from the eyes and deſires of all others; and therefore Moſes addes, <hi>thus ſhe was reproved,</hi> that is, though this ſpeech of his may not ſeem at firſt to imply ſo much, yet in truth he did thereby though covertly yet ſharply re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove her; for it was all one as if he had told her, that by denying her husband, ſhe had in a manner unveiled her ſelf, and laid her ſelf open to the unlawfull deſires of other men, and was guilty her ſelf of thoſe dangers, whereinto ſhe had fallen. God had made her husband the guardian of her chaſtity, and by denying him ſhe had expoſed her ſelf to the luſts of others. Thus was godly Sarah, to her greater ſhame, <hi>reproved</hi> by a profane king, and inſtructed how better to carry her ſelf hereafter.</p>

               <p>What cloſing up of the wombe this was, it is hard to ſay. Some think onely that God had reſtrained them from conceiving: and this may be; for this judgement might be inflicted and cured, &amp; yet not diſcerned by themſelves. But I ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther think it was ſome other extraordinary cloſing of the wombe, 1. Becauſe of that word <hi>faſt cloſed,</hi> which implies a judgement unuſuall; 2. Becauſe <hi>all were cloſed up;</hi> 3. Becauſe it is related as an apparent noted cure that followed Abrahams prayer.</p>

               <p>Iſhmael looking with an envious eye upon Iſaac at all times, was, as it ſeems, ſtung with the joy and jollity that was made at the weaning of him, and this repining of his heart brake forth at this time (as no doubt it had done often formerly) into ſome ſcornfull language and deriſion of him, mocking him as their young maſter, and he that muſt forſooth be heir of all.</p>

               <p>Sarah therefore perceived that this mocking proceeded both from Hagars and Iſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maels repining that Iſaac the younger ſonne ſhould be the heir.</p>

               <p>For the full underſtanding of this, we muſt know, 1. That the caſting of them out, which Sarah required, was not onely putting them out of his houſe, but an abſolute caſting them off, as if he had had nothing to do with them (for might he have provided for them in another place it would not have been ſo grievous to him) 2. That God had enjoyned him to hearken to Sarah in all things, the rather, no doubt, that the miſery of their caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out might puniſh them for their ſinne, who in mocking Iſaac had deſpiſed the
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:103385:30"/>
bleſſed ſeed promiſed in him. 3. That Abraham thus yielding to caſt her off, doth onely give her what ſhe could not be without (becauſe ſhe was to go through the wilderneſſe that lay in the way to Egypt) bread, that is, ſuch victualls as ſhe could carry with her, for this in the Scripture is uſually called <hi>bread,</hi> as we may ſee Mark 6. 36. <hi>This is a deſert place, and now the time is farre paſſed, ſend them away, that they may go into the countrey round about, and into the villages, and buy them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves bread;</hi> vvhich bread, Matth. 14. 15. is termed victualls, <hi>His Diſciples came to him, ſaying, This is a deſert place, and the time is now paſt, ſend the multitude away, that they may go into the villages, and buy themſelves victualls;</hi> and a bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of water, which ſhe might elſe want in thoſe dry barren places.</p>

               <p>The bottle of vva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter might have ſufficed till ſhe had come to ſome place of ſuccour, had ſhe not miſſed the direct way, and wandred up and down, as they might well in thoſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert places, not knowing where they were, nor which way to go.</p>
               <q>
                  <bibl>Verſ. 15.</bibl> And ſhe caſt the child under one of the ſhrubs.]</q>
               <p>He that vvas grovv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing apace to mans ſtature is often in Scripture called <hi>a child,</hi> as Iſhmael here, vvho vvas about eighteen years old; and Hagar is ſaid <hi>to cast the child under a ſhrub,</hi> becauſe ſhe left him being ſick and fainting for thirſt, vvhereas before ſhe had ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported and cheriſhed him.</p>

               <p>Both here and before mention is made of the lads voice, not Hagars; becauſe he it was that was in extremity, and her weeping was for him. <hi>God hath heard the voice of the lad,</hi> that is, God hath taken notice of his miſery, and will preſerve him: and theſe words <hi>where he is,</hi> are added to expreſſe, the better to Hagars apprehenſion, that God had taken notice of his danger, and would help him; as if he had ſaid, The child which you have yonder caſt off, as hopeleſſe of his life, God hath heard, and will preſerve and ſuccour him.</p>

               <p>Thus by the all-ruling Providence of God he propheſieth of that, whereof he knew nothing. It cannot be that he diſtinctly knew that he ſhould bring back his ſonne again; for then what great matter was there in this that he did? rather ſurely he ſpake this as a man aſtoniſhed and amazed: neither need we be ſo carefull to clear Abraham from ſeeking by this diſſembling to keep his ſervants from ſuſpecting that vvhich he vvent about; rather let us admire the wiſdome and goodneſſe of God, that he ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered Abraham in this greateſt of all humane actions to ſhew a little frailty, that we might not look for perfection here.</p>

               <p>But how vvas he able to carry ſo much wood as vvould ſerve for the burning up of the ſacrifice?

               <p>Abraham having required his ſervant to ſwear (as is related in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going verſes) that he ſhould not take a wife for his ſonne of the daughters of the Canaanites, but that he ſhould go unto the land from whence he came, and there amongſt his kindred provide a wife for him, in theſe words the ſervant objects a caſe that might happen, and deſires direction therein, to wit, if there were not a fit wiſe found amongſt his kindred, that would leave her countrey to come into Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan, nor yield to marry Iſaac, but upon condition that he ſhould leave Canaan, and come into the land where ſhe dwelt, whether in this caſe he ſhould be ſo ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bound by his oath to provide him a wife amongſt his kindred, that of neceſſity he muſt conſent to this condition, rather then not to marry him to one of them; this I ſay is doubtleſſe the drift of theſe words, <hi>Muſt I needs bring thy ſonne again unto the Land from whence thou cameſt?</hi> Onely further yet to clear them, two things muſt be noted: 1.

               <p>This anſwer God returned Rebekah to ſatisfie her concerning that ſtrange and ſupernaturall ſtruggling of the children that were in her womb: wherein ſhe is informed, 1. that ſhe had two ſonnes in her womb that ſhould be the heads of two ſeverall nations, the Edomites, and the Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites, the one the poſterity of Eſau, the other the poſterity of Jacob; 2. that theſe two nations ſhould differ much the one from the other, and not agree together, but be croſſe and contrary, one to the other: the which is implyed in theſe words, <hi>two manner of nations ſhall be ſeparated from thy bowels:</hi> as they ſhould be divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in regard of their habitation, ſeated in two ſeverall countreys; ſo they ſhould differ much in their laws, Religion, and manners, and be ſo farre from living at unity, as brethren that deſcended from the ſame loyns, that they ſhould be almoſt alwayes at variance one with the other; and indeed to ſignifie this it was that theſe two Twinnes did now ſo ſtruggle together in her womb; 3. <hi>that the one people ſhould be ſtronger then the other,</hi> that is, the Edomites, the poſterity of Eſau the el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der brother, ſhould be ſtronger then the Iſraelites, the poſterity of Jacob; the truth whereof the ſtory of theſe two Nations doth ſufficiently manifeſt. As Eſau was ſtronger then Jacob, and therefore Jacob was <hi>forced to fly from his fury,</hi> Gen. 27. and at his return From Meſopotamia to crouch to him, and by preſents to ſeek his favour, Gen. 32. and Gen. 33. 3. <hi>He paſſed over before them, and bowed himſelf to the ground ſeven times, untill he came near unto his brother;</hi> ſo the Edomites were a long time a Nation farre more potent then the Iſraelites, as may be ſeen by their churliſh anſwer to the Iſraelites, Num. 20. 18. <hi>And Edom ſaid unto him, thou ſhalt not paſſe by me, leſt I come out against thee with the ſword;</hi> and 4. that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the elder ſhould be the ſtronger, yet in the concluſion the younger ſhould prevail, and get the better of the elder, <hi>and ſo the elder ſhould ſerve the younger.</hi> How this was accompliſht carnally, to wit, in the Iſraelites ſubduing of the Edomites, is evident in ſeverall places of ſacred ſtory, 2.

They, having received a promiſe of the Covenant of grace for them and their ſeed after them, were wont before they died, in the name of God, and by the guidance of the holy Ghoſt, to foreſhew upon which of their ſeed this Covenant of grace ſhould be continued; and ſo did, as it were by will and teſtament, paſſe over the right of the Covenant and promiſe of grace to thoſe of their children, who were to be heirs of the Covenant, and in whoſe families the Church and the Covenant of grace was to be propagated unto the coming of Chriſt; whence is that phraſe of <hi>inheriting the bleſsing,</hi> Heb. 12. 17. And thus Iſaac intended now to bleſſe Eſau; and that doubtleſſe becauſe he knew not Gods will and purpoſe herein; for it is not probable, that ſo good a man would wittingly ſeek to croſſe the known decree of God concerning his ſonnes. It cannot be but Rebekah acquainted Iſaac with that Oracle, Gen. 25. 23. where the Lord ſaid unto her, <hi>Two nations are in thy womb, and two manner of people ſhall be ſeparated from thy bowels; the one people ſhall be ſtronger then the other, and the elder ſhall ſerve the younger;</hi> and being her ſelf perſwaded thereby that God intended the bleſſing to the younger, did what ſhe could to convince her husband likewiſe that it was ſo. But, it ſeems, though God were pleaſed thus farre to enlighten her mind, and powerfully to incline her heart to believe this truth, yet ſtill he ſuffered him to erre herein; yea, even now at the laſt, though he enlightned his underſtanding by a propheticall illumination as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the bleſſing he pronounced, yet withall at the ſame time he did neither en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten his underſtanding, nor bend his will to the right perſon, but left him here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in to his own ſpirit; and ſo being carried by his carnall judgement concerning the prerogative of Eſaus being his firſt-born, and by his affection to him, intended him the bleſſing, but was diſappointed by Gods providence, that it might be the more evident that it was not by the will of man, but of Gods free grace and ſingular fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, that Jacob had the bleſſing and not Eſau. Why Iſaac deſired <hi>ſavoury meat, ſuch as he loved,</hi> before he performed this work, it is hard to ſay. The moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable reaſon given is this, that being aged and feeble, he deſired this refreſhing to cheer up his ſpirits, that he might be the fitter inſtrument of the holy Spirit of God in pronouncing this propheticall bleſſing; as Eliſha, when he was moved againſt king Jehoram, called for a muſician to allay his paſſion, and quicken his ſpirit, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he propheſied to them in the name of the Lord, 2. Kings 3. 14, 15. However doubtleſſe God by this means intended to give Rebekah the advantage of this time, to plot for the transferring of the bleſſing in Eſaus abſence upon Jacob, to whom of right it did belong.</p>

now ready, as much as in him lay, to croſſe the counſel and purpoſe of God, ſhe reſolves to aſſay to diſappoint her husband, and that by ſubtilty and deceit, and ſo inſtructs Jacob how to deceive his father; wherein, though ſhe did many things that are not warrantable (unleſſe ſhe were moved by the ſpeciall inſtinct of Gods Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, which doth not appear) yet thus farre ſhe is praiſe-worthy, that underſtanding rightly the Oracle of God, ſhe ſought to prevent the errour of her husband, and to procure the bleſſing to him for whom God had appointed it.</p>

Thus therefore I conceive of this place, That Iſaac, as a man ſuddenly aſtoniſht and amazed, is at firſt diſtracted with ſeverall fears, and knows not what to fear moſt; yet at laſt percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving how evidently the hand of God was in this buſineſſe, he ſhakes off all carnall affections, and confirms the bleſſing to Jacob; <hi>I have eaten of all before thou cameſt, and have bleſſed him; yea and he ſhall be bleſſed.</hi>

               <p>That is, the bleſſing of the birthright, which according to the ordinary courſe of nature, unleſſe God did otherwiſe diſpoſe of it, belonged to the elder, and which Iſaac had before promiſed Eſau, and did really intend to conferre upon him, though now it were ſettled upon Jacob, to whom by Gods decree and purpoſe it did of right appertain.</p>

               <p>Upon Eſaus bitter lamentation and weeping, mentioned in the former verſe, Iſaac now foretells the earthly bleſsings that ſhould befall Eſaus poſterity: but as for the prime and chief bleſsing, that was ſettled upon Jacob, neither had Iſaac the leaſt thought of altering what he had done herein, as the Apoſtle ſaith concerning Eſau, Heb. 12. 17. <hi>When he would have inherited the bleſsing he was rejected; for he found no place of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, though he ſought it with tears;</hi> that is, all his crying and weeping could not move Iſaac to repent of what he had done, or reverſe the bleſsing, which, though unwittingly, he had conferred upon Jacob. Yea ſome note a difference betwixt Eſaus bleſsing here concerning outward things, and that of Jacobs, verſ. 28. to wit, becauſe though the ſame outward bleſsings be here promiſed to Eſau that were before promiſed to Jacob, <hi>the dew of heaven and the fatneſſe of the earth;</hi> yet they are promiſed to Jacob in another manner then they are to Eſau: for to Eſau it is onely ſaid that he ſhould have theſe things, <hi>thy dwelling ſhall be the fatneſſe of the earth, and of the dew of heaven,</hi> to wit, by the ordinary diſpenſation of Gods providence;

ſonne: But ſince that time doubtleſſe Bethuel and Laban knew well enough in what condition Iſaac and Rebekah lived, and therefore there was no need in this regard to ſend their ſonne Jacob in ſuch a manner. 2. That Abrahams ſervant went to fetch a wife immediately for Iſaac, but Jacob went purpoſely to ſtay and ſojourn with his uncle for a time, till his brothers fury was over, and therefore Rebekah might happely think it inconvenient to ſend any company along with him. 3.

               <p>The end of this viſion was doubtleſſe that God might teſtifie unto Jacob that he would take care of him, and ſo might thereby comfort him in this his deſolate condition, and ſtrengthen his faith againſt all thoſe diſcouragements he ſhould meet with in this journey. There can be therefore no queſtion made but that by this <hi>Ladder</hi> was ſignified the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of God in governing the world, and particularly his provident care over Jacob, and that, as it is Pſal. 113. 5, 6. <hi>Though God dwelleth on high, yet he humbleth himſelf to behold the things that are in the heaven, and in the earth,</hi> and diſpoſeth all things according to his will, and that eſpecially by the miniſtry of his Angels, according to that of David, Pſal. 91. 11, 12. <hi>For he ſhall give his Angels charge over thee, to keep thee in all thy wayes; they ſhall bear thee up in their hands, leſt thou daſh thy foot againſt a ſtone.</hi> But yet becauſe Chriſt is the onely foundation of that reconciliation that is wrought betwixt God and Man, and of that ſpeciall care which God takes for the welfare of his Church and people, in and through whom they are made the ſonnes of God, and heirs of heaven, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy the miniſtry of the Angels, Heb. 1. 13. <hi>Are they not all ministring ſpirits, ſent forth to miniſter for them who ſhall be heirs of ſalvation?</hi> therefore alſo que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtionleſſe by this <hi>Ladder</hi> Chriſt was repreſented, the promiſed ſeed, <hi>in whom all the promiſes are yea and amen,</hi> 2. Cor. 1. 20. as methinks our Saviour himſelf did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate in thoſe words of his concerning himſelf, John. 1. 52. <hi>Verily, verily I ſay unto you, hereafter ye ſhall ſee heaven open and the Angels of God aſcending and deſcending upon the ſonne of man.</hi> In his two natures perſonally united, heaven and earth are as it were joyned together: By him our onely Mediatour is man recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled to God, <hi>and both the things in heaven and the things on earth are reconciled through the bloud of his croſſe,</hi> Col. 1. 20. By his onely merit and interceſſion both the miniſtry of the Angels, the gifts of the holy Ghoſt, and all other heavenly bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings do deſcend upon us: and by him likewiſe we have acceſſe unto God and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance into heaven. And thus by this viſion Jacob was aſſured that through the promiſed ſeed, <hi>Chriſt,</hi> he ſhould enjoy the guard of the holy Angels, and that he ſhould be by them defended both in his going out and returning home.</p>

                  <bibl>Verſ. 20.</bibl> And Jacob vowed a vow, ſaying, If God will be with me, &amp;c.]</q>
               <p>Jacob being much affected with Gods gratious goodneſſe to him in the glorious viſion he had ſeen, and the many precious promiſes therein made to him, doth here, by way of thankfulneſſe, vow a vow unto God, not onely in generall, verſ. 21. <hi>that then the Lord ſhould be his God,</hi> that is, he would then for ever acknowledge the Lord God of his Fathers to be the Authour of his welfare and ſalvation, love, worſhip, and ſerve him, yea and him onely; but alſo particularly verſ. 22. 1. <hi>that the ſtone which he had now ſet up for a pillar ſhould be Gods houſe,</hi> that is, he would account that ſtone or pillar, or that place where that ſtone was erected (for both are included figuratively) a holy place, conſecrated to Gods worſhip and ſervice, and would there perform the duties of his worſhip (which part of his vow he made good, Gen. 35. 6, 7. when at his return out of Meſopotamia <hi>he built there an altar and offered thereon ſacrifices to the Lord)</hi> and 2. <hi>that of all that God ſhould give him, he would give the tenth unto God,</hi> that is, that he would ſet it apart for Gods ſpeciall ſervice, as by imploying it in building altars, and ſacrifices, and relieving the poore upon any occaſion. Indeed concerning the firſt of theſe ſome doubt may ariſe in our minds, How Jacob could vow that upon ſuch &amp; ſuch condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, then the Lord ſhould be his God, which may imply a reſolution on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary that in caſe ſuch conditions were not performed, or did not come to paſſe, then the Lord ſhould not be his God. But to this I anſwer, 1. That men that wait in expectation of receiving ſome ſpeciall bleſſing from God, may vow upon the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining hereof to perform their duty to God, which otherwiſe by covenant they are bound to perform, and yet not intend that in caſe they fail of this they deſire, then they will not; onely thereby they profeſſe that this ſhall be a new ingagement to bind them to perform their duty herein, and to make them the more ſolicitouſly carefull to carry themſelves herein as they ought to do: and 2. That with a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall vow ſomething may be, and is uſually added, which ſhall not depend upon the premiſed conditions, but is onely annexed as a neceſſary concomitant of the vow; as if a man ſhould vow, if God ſhould bleſſe him according to his hopes in a voyage he is to undertake, that then he would for ever honour his poore parents,

               <p>Whether Eſau came with this troop againſt Jacob with a purpoſe to deſtroy him, and ſo to be revenged on him, as long ſince he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, it is not evident in the text: the moſt Expoſitours are of that mind, and that God did miraculouſly change his heart by that time they met together. Yet others judge it more probable, that Eſau meant not to cut off Jacob; &amp; indeed they alledge a very probable reaſon for it: for if, ſay they, out of reverence to his father, Eſau reſtrained himſelf vvhen he was in the freſheſt and hotteſt of his paſsion, it is not likely that now after twenty years abſence he would have no reſpect to the grief of his aged father (who was ſtill living) but by ſlaying his brother bring his gray hairs with ſorrow to the grave. However, evident it is that the meſſengers feared he came in his diſpleaſure, and to that end brought ſuch a band of men along with him, which no marvell it is though Jacob were very ready to believe.</p>

               <p>Bethel was diſtant from She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chem Southward about thirty Engliſh miles. Now Jacob being at this time perplexed with fear becauſe of that which his ſonnes had done to the She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chemites, and perhaps adviſing with himſelf about removing to ſome other place, the Lord appeared to him, and appointed him to go up to Bethel, and to build there an Altar unto God that appeared to him when he fled from the face of his brother Eſau, thereby calling to his remembrance the gracious promiſes which God had there made to him, and the vow which he there had made to God, chap. 28. 22. <hi>And this ſtone which I have ſet for a pillar ſhall be Gods houſe; and of all that thou ſhalt give me, I will ſurely give the tenth unto thee.</hi>

               <p>That is, not onely to them of his own proper houſe or family, but alſo to all that were of his retinue, that pitched their tents with him, and as appertaining to him, ſtill removed whither he removed; of which there might be a great number, ſervants born in the houſe and bought with money, Gen. 14. 14. <hi>And when Abraham heard that his brother was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken captive, he armed his trained ſervants, born in his own houſe, three hundred and eighteen perſons.</hi>

him to go to that place which he had formerly found ſo dreadfull, even as <hi>the houſe of God, and as the gate of heaven,</hi> Gen. 28. 17. and where he was to perform the vow which he had made, he deemed it requiſite that they ſhould in a ſpeciall manner prepare and ſanctifie themſelves; and of this he informs them of his family, &amp; wills them in the firſt place to put away <hi>the ſtrange</hi> or <hi>the ſtrangers gods</hi> that were amongſt them, that is, idoles which other nations worſhipped, but might not be endured amongſt thoſe that worſhipped the true God. And hereby I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that he intended not Labans gods, which Rachel had ſtolen (for it is not like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that this good Patriarch did all this while ſuffer his wives and children either to worſhip, or with his knowledge to keep, <hi>ſtrange Gods</hi> amongſt them) but rather the idoles of the Shechemites, which by his children or ſervants might be taken for the worth of them, when they ſpoiled the city, and ſuch idolatrous and ſuperſtitious monuments as were brought forth of Meſopotamia by thoſe of his retinue, whom he ſuſpected to be ſtill too much addicted to the ſuperſtitions of that countrey: and yet perhaps both thoſe which Rachel had ſtolen, and any other ſecretly kept a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them, were now brought in upon theſe words of Jacob.</p>
               <q>And be clean, and change your garments.]</q>
               <p>It is clear by this place, that as the Lord did enjoyn the Patriarchs many rites of ſacrificing which were afterward more fully enjoyned the Iſraelites by the written Law, ſo alſo he taught them many of thoſe externall rites of purifying themſelves by waſhing in water, and changing of their garments, of which we reade expreſſely in the Law, Levit. 15. 13. <hi>And when he that hath an iſſue is cleanſed of his iſſue, then he ſhall number to himſelf ſeven dayes for his cleanſing, and waſh his clothes,</hi> &amp;c. and Numb. 31. 23. <hi>Every thing that may abide the fire, you ſhall make it to go through the fire, and it ſhall be clean: Nevertheleſſe it ſhall be purified<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with the water of ſeparation; and all that abideth not the fire ye ſhall make to go through the water;</hi> which were even in theſe times as ſo many ſhadows of the ſpirituall cleanſing of men from all filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the fleſh and ſpirit, that renewing by faith and repentance, which God requires eſpecially of all thoſe that draw near to him in the duties of his worſhip.</p>

ſcruple to conclude, that though the coming of Jacob to his father Iſaac be not yet mentioned, he had been there long before this (for who can think that Jacob would be ten or twelve years in Canaan after he was come from Laban, with whom he had ſerved twenty years, and never go in all that time to ſee his aged fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) undoubtedly there was continuall intercourſe betwixt them; and ſo Deborah being come at this time to Jacob (it may be upon Rebekahs death, or ſome other occaſion) there died, and with great mourning was buried.</p>

Becauſe till Joſeph was ſold into Egypt, Judah dwelt amongſt his brethren, and therefore, as is likely, it was after this that he went aſide and matched himſelf with the daughter of Shuah the Canaanite: And that all theſe things here related, concerning Judah and his children, might well be within the compaſſe of three and twenty years, they ſhew thus, to wit, 1. That Judah might marry and have his three ſonnes, Er, Onan, and Shelah by his wife, the daughter of Shuah, in the firſt three years after Joſeph vvas ſold into Egypt; 2. That Er might be marriedto Tamar when he vvas ſixteen years old, &amp; Onan alſo the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

year, vvhich was towards the latter end of the ſeven plenteous years in Egypt, about eighteen years after Joſeph was ſold thither; and 3. That in the five follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing years Tamar might by Judah, as is here related, conceive with child, and bring forth Pharez and Zarah, a little before their going into Egypt. And whereas it may be objected that Pharez had two ſonnes, Hezron, and Hamul, vvhen Jacob vvent dovvn into Egypt, Gen. 46. 12. <hi>The ſonnes of Pharez were Hezron and Hamul:</hi> to this they anſwer, That Hezron and Hamul are there reckoned amongſt thoſe that vvent dovvn vvith Jacob into Egypt, not becauſe they were then born, but becauſe they vvere of Jacobs family in Egypt, vvhileſt Jacob vvas yet living: Thus, I ſay, ſome Expoſitours underſtand this place, that Judah married this Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anites daughter (contrary no doubt to his father Jacobs mind, who vvas himſelf ſtrictly forbidden to marry amongſt them by Iſaac) that very year that Joſeph was ſold into Egypt. But 2. becauſe Hezron and Hamul are ſo expreſly reckoned amongſt thoſe that vvent dovvn vvith Jacob into Egypt, Gen 46. 12. therefore many Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitours, yea the moſt, conceive that theſe vvords, <hi>And it came to paſſe at that time,</hi> muſt not be taken ſtrictly, that Judah married thus <hi>at that time,</hi> vvhen Joſeph was ſold into Egypt; but that it vvas done <hi>about that time,</hi> that is, ſay they, at Jacobs firſt coming into the land of Canaan, vvhen he left his uncle Laban: and the ground of this their opinion is this, becauſe Jacobs coming from Laban (vvhich vvas when Joſeph vvas ſix years old, as is evident if vve compare Gen. 30. 25. <hi>And it came to paſſe when Rachel had born Joſeph, that Jacob ſaid unto Laban, Send me away, &amp;c. give me my wives and my children for whom I have ſerved thee, and let me go,</hi> &amp;c. vvith Gen. 31. 40. <hi>Thus have I been twenty years in thy houſe: I ſerved thee fourteen years for thy two daughters, and ſix years for thy cattel,</hi> &amp;c.) vvas but eleven years before Joſeph vvas ſold into Egypt, &amp; conſequently not above foure &amp; thirty years at the moſt ere Jacob vvent dovvn thither to Joſeph; all vvhich time vvill be ſtrait enough, if not too little, for all theſe things to be done in that are here related, and for the birth of Ezron and Hamul, the ſonnes of Pharez, vvho are reckoned amongſt thoſe that vvent dovvn vvith Jacob into Egypt: for though Judah married the daughter of Shuah about tvvo years after their coming into Canaan (and yet vvas he then but thirteen years old, as being at the utmoſt but five y<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Nor is that ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of any great ſtrength that is brought againſt this, to wit, that ſhe dwelt now with her own father, over whom Judah could have no ſuch power to fetch her thence, and puniſh her as he pleaſed; ſince ſhe might be fetched to Judah under ſome other pretence, and then he might proceed againſt her. But 2. others conceive
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:103385:52"/>
that Judah had no ſuch power to pronounce ſentence againſt her, but onely made known his will to have a ſtrict courſe taken againſt her; <hi>Bring her forth,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>and let her be burnt,</hi> that is, let her be carried before the magiſtrate, and be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with burning according to the law of the countrey.

               <p>Becauſe he was ſo famous for his propheticall interpretation of dreams, the common opinion of the Egyptians was that he uſed divination, as their Magicians and Wiſemen did: Joſeph therefore appoints his ſteward to ſay thus according to the opinion the Egyptians had of him, 1. That he might the better conceal himſelf from his brethren; 2. That he might make their fault ſeem more hainous, little leſſe then ſacriledge, to ſteal ſo ſacred a thing; 3.

The whole family of Jacob were ſeventie ſouls, which is purpoſely noted, that we might take notice what a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous work of God it was, that this family of Jacob ſhould within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe of two hundred and fifteen years multiply ſo exceedingly, that at their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture there ſhould be of them ſix hundred thouſand that bore arms, beſides the Levites, old men, women and children. It was indeed a ſtrange and miraculous increaſe, and therefore we ſee Moſes reckons it as one of the moſt wonderfull works which God had done for that people, Deut. 10. 22. <hi>Thy fathers went down into Egypt with threeſcore and ten perſons, and now the Lord thy God hath made thee as the ſtarres of heaven for multitude.</hi> The greateſt difficultie concerning this place, is, how it may be reconciled with that relation which Stephen makes of this, Acts 7. 14. that when Jacob went down into Egypt, he and his kindred, there were of them threeſcore and fifteen ſouls. But to this there are two anſwers given by Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitours, either of which may give ſatisfaction, to wit, 1. That Stephen, or S. Luke relating the words of S. Stephen, did purpoſely follow the tranſlation of the Septu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agint in this place, who have here indeed <hi>ſeventie five,</hi> and not ſeventie ſouls; and that becauſe the Greek tranſlation of the Septuagint was moſt frequently uſed in thoſe times, and though it were corrupt in this place, and not according to the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew originall, yet he would not therefore in a matter of ſo ſmall conſequence ſet down the number of Jacobs family otherwiſe then it was there, eſpecially conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that in ſome ſenſe alſo it was a truth, that there went down of Jacobs family at leaſt ſeventie five ſouls, to wit, if their wives alſo ſhould be added to the number: or 2. That S. Stephen ſpeaks of the whole family of Jacob that are here mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Moſes; and indeed leaving out Jacob, and numbring all of his family that are named here by Moſes, to wit, Er and Onan, the ſonnes of Judah that died in Canaan, and the foure wives which are mentioned here by Moſes, though not caſt up in the totall ſumme, it is clearly true that there are here named of his family or kindred ſeventie and five ſouls.</p>

               <p>Jacob called his life <hi>a pilgrimage,</hi> not onely with reſpect to his travelling up and down, and living as a ſtranger firſt in Meſopotamia, afterwards in Canaan, now in Egypt; but alſo eſpecially with reſpect unto that heavenly inheritance which is the reſt of Gods people, to which they are ſtill travelling, eſteeming them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves but pilgrimes here in this world: for ſo it is expreſſely ſaid of the patriarchs, Heb. 11. 13. that they confeſſed themſelves ſtrangers and pilgrimes on the earth, and ſought a better, even an heavenly countrey. As for the age of Jacob here ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſely made known to Pharaoh, it helps much to the underſtanding of the time of other paſſages of this hiſtory: for Joſeph being now nine and thirty years old when Jacob was an hundred and thirty (for he was thirty years old when he was firſt exalted in Egypt, chap. 41. 46. and ſince that there had been ſeven years of plenty and two years of famine, chap. 45. 6.) it muſt needs follow that Jacob was ninety one when Joſeph was born in the fourteenth year of his ſervice with Laban, and conſequently that he was about ſeventy ſeven when he firſt went down into Meſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potamia, flying from the rage of his brother Eſau.</p>

This may be taken in a double ſenſe: 1. That he removed them from one end of Egypt to the other (that is all the land over) out of their countrey-dwellings into the cities, and ſo by this means, 1. They give up the poſſeſſion of their land to Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh; 2. They are the more commodiouſly nouriſhed out of the kings granaries; 3. The deſolate places of the cities are filled up, and ſo many onely as are neceſſary are ſent out to till the ground, the famine being ceaſed; or elſe (which I rather think) the meaning is onely this, that he tranſplanted them from one town unto another, not leaving them in that which was their own, that ſo it might appear the land was his, and they onely his ſervants.</p>

               <p>Namely to God, by vvay of thankfulneſſe, both for thoſe promiſes (in the faithfull expectation vvhere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he had deſired to be buried in the land of Canaan) and for this preſent mercy that novv by Joſeph he vvas aſſured that he ſhould be buried in the promiſed land. Novv becauſe he vvas bed-rid through vveakneſſe or age, or at leaſt lying upon his couch, Moſes ſhevveth hovv he bovved himſelf, to vvit, that turning his face to the bed, and ſo rearing himſelf upon the bolſter at his beds head, he then bovved him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and vvorſhipped the Lord. And indeed ſuch vvas the zeal of the good ſervants of God in thoſe times, that vvhen they vvere bed-rid, it ſeems they endeavoured in the beſt manner they could vvith ſome devotion and bovving of their bodies to vvorſhip the Lord: for ſo it is ſaid alſo of David vvhen he kept his bed by reaſon of vveakneſſe in his old age, 1.

               <p>Becauſe there was one portion of land in Canaan, which was Jacobs not onely by Gods donation, as vvas all the land of Canaan; but alſo by a ſpeciall civill right, this he now bequeaths to Joſeph, to whom he intended to transferre the dignitie of the firſtborn, 1. Chron. 5. 1. <hi>His birthright was given unto the ſonnes of Joſeph, the ſonne of Iſrael,</hi> &amp;c. for though it vvas now as well as the reſt of the land in the hand of the Canaanites, yet he did aſſuredly believe that God would caſt out the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants, and plant his poſteritie in their room, and therefore as a pledge hereof, to confirm Joſephs faith herein, and the better to take off his affections from the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights of Egypt, and to pitch them upon the expectation of Gods promiſe herein, he novv bequeaths to him this parcell of land, which ſhould be his childrens over and above that lot which in the common diviſion of the land ſhould befall them. That this portion of land vvhich Jacob gave to his ſonne Joſeph vvas nigh unto Shechem (vvhich in proceſſe of time vvas corruptly called Sychar) is evident by the words of the evangeliſt, John 4. 5. <hi>Which is called Sychar, near to the parcell of ground that Jacob gave his ſonne Joſeph:</hi> And there though many Expoſitours underſtand it of the citie Shechem with all the field or territories adjoyning, which, ſay they, according to this prophecie of Jacobs, fell to the ſonnes of Joſeph when the land vvas divided amongſt the tribes, Joſh. 17. 7. <hi>The coast of Manaſſeh was from Aſher to Michmethah, that lyeth before Shechem;</hi> yet I conceive it is onely meant of that parcell of land which there <hi>he bought of Hamor Shechems fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for an hundred pieces of money,</hi> as is related Gen. 33. 19. which hereupon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came his own proper inheritance, and there afterwards therefore Jacobs ſonnes fed their fathers flocks, Gen. 37. 12. and there Joſephs bones were buried by the Iſraelites when they came into Canaan, as in the inheritance peculiarly bequeathed him by his father Jacob, Joſh. 24. 32. <hi>The bones of Joſeph buried they in Shechem in a parcell of ground which Ja<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

But beſides not ſo much the quantity as the qualitie of the gift is to be regarded: for this being all he had in Canaan by vvay of purchaſe, Jacob, by bequeathing this in ſpeciall to Joſeph, did as it vvere
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:103385:61"/>
deſigne him his heir, and conferre upon him the dignitie of the firſtborn, vvhich vvas no ſmall Prerogative. The greateſt difficultie in theſe vvords is, vvhy Jacob ſaith that <hi>he took this portion of the land</hi> of Canaan novv bequeathed to Joſeph, <hi>out of the hand of the Amorites with his ſword and with his bow?</hi> And for ſatisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this doubt, there are ſeverall anſvvers given by Expoſitours: for firſt ſome ſay that it is uſuall in the Scripture to ſpeak prophetically of things to come, as if they were done already: ſo the birth of Chriſt is foretold by the Prophet Eſai. 9. 6. under theſe terms, <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto us a child is born;</hi> and ſo, ſay they, here Jacob, out of the aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of his faith, ſpeaks of the Iſraelites taking this land out of the hands of the inhabitants by force of arms as if it vvere done already: 2. Others hold that he ſpeaks this vvith reference to the ſlaughter of the Shechemites by the ſvvord of his ſonnes and ſervants, vvhich fact hovvever he deteſted and abhorred, yet becauſe they armed themſelves as it vvere under his name, and in revenge of vvrong done to him and his, and becauſe through <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ods juſt vengeance upon the Shechemites and his ſingular favour to Jacob, the land, the inhabitants vvhereof they had utterly deſtroyed, fell to him, the neighbouring inhabitants not daring to oppoſe him by reaſon of a divine terrour vvherevvith they vvere ſtricken, and ſo he through Gods providence reaped the benefit of that deſolation vvhich his ſonnes had vvickedly made in thoſe parts; therefore he affirms here, that he took it out of the hand of the Amorite with his ſword and with his bow: 3. Some again conceive that when Jacob removed to Hebron, after the ſlaughter of the Shechemites, the bordering in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants entered upon the territories of Shechem, and together with the reſt alſo took into their hands that parcell of ground which Jacob had there purchaſed; which when they would not reſtore, Jacob did by force of arms drive them out, and ſo recovered his own rightfull poſſeſſion; which however it were not before related, ſufficient it is, that it is here by Moſes occaſionally mentioned: And laſtly, ſome conclude that theſe words, <hi>Which I took out of the hand of the Amorite with my ſword and with my bow,</hi> are figuratively ſpoken, and meant onely of the purchaſe that he made of it (accordingly as we uſe to ſay that a man gets a thing <hi>ſuo Marte,</hi> or <hi>ſuis cop<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Joſh. 24. 8. <hi>And I brought you into the land of the Amorites, which dwelt on the other ſide Jordan,</hi> &amp;c. and indeed theſe tvvo laſt anſvvers I conceive to be the moſt ſatisfactory, becauſe it is evident that he challengeth this portion of land to be his by a ſpeciall right vvhich he novv gives unto Joſeph; and he might as vvell have ſaid that he had taken the vvhole land of Canaan by his ſvvord and by his bovv, as this particular portion, if he had ſpoken prophetically concerning the conqueſt of the land in time to come by his poſteritie;
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:103385:62"/>
and partly becauſe it is not probable that Jacob would alledge the cruell maſſacre of the Shechemites as the ground of his rightfull intereſt in this parcell of land which he did alwayes ſo abhorre and deteſt, or that he would call their weapons <hi>his ſword and his bow,</hi> which immediately afterwards he calls <hi>inſtruments of crueltie,</hi> or, <hi>weapons of violence,</hi> chap. 49. 5.</p>

The chief difficultie of this place is, in making good the truth of this prophecy, concerning the continuance of Judahs principalitie and kingdome untill the Meſſiahs coming, and that becauſe it is evident, 1. That after Jechoniah and Zedekiah, the two laſt kings of Judah, they had no more any king of that roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all houſe of David, nor of the tribe of Judah: for ſo Jeremiah prophecied concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Jechoniah, Jer. 22. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

That after their return from their captivity in Babylon, though in the principalitie of Zorobabel, and perhaps of ſome of his poſterity, there was a little reviving of the dignitie of Judahs tribe, yet within few years, the ſupreme, yea the regall, power came into the hands of the Macchabees, who were of the tribe of Levi, and yet ruled many of them as kings over the Jews, untill Herod did wholly take away their principality from them. Now to this ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection ſome anſwer, That though in the time of the Macchabees, who were indeed of the tribe of Levi, the chief power was removed from the tribe of Judah, yet there was then a Lawgiver from between his feet, to wit, the Sanhedrin, that great Councell of ſeventy Elders, to whom the cognizance of the weightieſt cauſes apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, and the eſtabliſhing of laws, and who were ſtill elected out of the tribe of Judah, and continued conſtantly in the exerciſe of this power untill a little before the birth of Chriſt, Herod who was a mere ſtranger became king of Judea, and rooted them quite out; yet becauſe the chief thing alledged in this anſwer to ſatisfie the objection, to wit, that the Sanhedrin were all choſen out of the tribe of Judah, is taken for granted, but cannot be well proved, a more full anſwer I conceive is given by others in theſe following particulars: 1. That by <hi>Judah</hi> here is meant the whole nation and kingdome of the Jews, after the ten tribes of Iſrael were ſeparated from them, and became a kingdome apart by it ſelf, and that becauſe although there were of the tribes of Levi and Benjamin amongſt them, yet they were as it were
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:103385:64"/>
incorporated into the tribe of Judah, and the whole commonwealth had their name from Judah, and was called the kingdome of Judah; inſomuch that in the eleaventh chapter of the firſt book of the kings, three ſeverall times, to wit, verſ. 13, 32, 36. it is ſaid that there ſhould be onely one tribe reſerved to the kings that were of the poſteritie of David; and 1. King. 12. 20. it is ſaid, <hi>There was none that followed the houſe of David but the tribe of Judah onely;</hi> yea and after their return from the captivitie out of Babylon, they were all chiefly planted in the lot and territory that appertained to the tribe of Judah: whence it is, that though after Nehemiahs time, the chief government was in the hands of the prieſts, yet becauſe the whole people were called by the name of Judah, the kingdome and commonwealth of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah, therefore ſtill the government may be ſaid to be in Judah; yea and this there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore may well be thought to be the main thing intended in this prophecie, that whereas thoſe of the kingdome of the ten tribes of Iſrael, after they were carried away captive into Aſſyria, did never return thence again to become a kingdome and commonwealth as before, yet thoſe of Judah, after ſeventy years captivity in Babylon, returned again into their own land, and became a kingdome and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth as before, though not ſo glorious, living under the government of their own lavvs, and the command of their own rulers, and ſo continued, untill a little before Chriſts coming the government vvas vvholly taken from them, and not long after the death of Chriſt, their kingdome and commonvvealth vv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

That even at that time vvhen the ſupreme povver vvas in the prieſts, they had it by the choice and appointment of the people of Judah, vvho conferred this honour upon the Macchabees becauſe of their zeal and valour in fighting againſt their enemies. 3. Though all the Sanhedrim vvere not of the tribe of Judah, yet doubtleſſe the greateſt part of them vvere of that tribe, as it is evident, becauſe the greateſt part by farre of thoſe that returned from Babylon vvere of that tribe, vvhich is ſufficient to make good this prophecy, <hi>That there ſhould not ceaſe to be a Lawgiver from between Judahs feet,</hi> that is, of his ſeed and progeny, <hi>untill the Meſsias came.</hi>

That they are an am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plification of that which went before concerning the bleſſings wherewith he had bleſſed them, ſhewing that they were bleſſings not onely temporall, but alſo ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all and eternall, ſuch as ſhould reach beyond the continuance of the mountains and hills, which yet ſhould continue till time ſhould be no more, and are therefore called, <hi>everlasting hills:</hi> whence is that of the prophet, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

And indeed herein was the chief and ſurpaſſing excellency of Jacobs bleſſing above thoſe of his proge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitours, that all his ſonnes were appointed heirs of the promiſe, and of the covenant of grace, not one of them being excluded, as Iſhmael and Eſau were; and 3. they are added to ſet forth the riches of the portion of land which ſhould befall the tribes of Ephraim and Manaſſeh in the diviſion of Canaan, which as it ſhould abound with all other deſirable bleſſings, ſo alſo <hi>with the chief things of the ancient moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, and the precious things of the lasting hills,</hi> as Moſes calls them in his bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of Joſeph, Deut. 33. 15.

               <p>Becauſe the wolf is a ſtrong and fierce beaſt, and goeth forth uſually both mornings and evenings to ſeek his prey, Jacob here compares this tribe to a ravening wolf, and that to ſignifie, they ſhould be a very ſtrong couragious and warlike people, and that they ſhould with admirable violence vanquiſh and deſtroy their enemies, and return from the battel laden with the ſpoils. And indeed that this tribe of Benjamin was in future times of a warlike diſpoſition, we find in many places of the ſacred hiſtory, and eſpecially in thoſe bloudy battels which they fought with their brethren of the other tribes, where though there were of the other tribes foure hundred thouſand armed men, &amp; themſelves were but five and twenty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand and ſeven hundred, yet they twice overcame them, and ſlew of them eight and thirtie thouſand; and it is there particularly noted of theſe Benjamites (which ſhows what active men they werefor the warre) that there were amongſt them <hi>ſeven hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred choſen men left-handed, thatcould every one ſling ſtones at a hairs breadth</hi>

They are bleſſed alſo in that he concludes them within the number of the tribes, and ſo comprehendeth them within the Covenant: for by this means they have an equall right with the reſt to the land of promiſe, and by faith to the heavenly Canaan, whereof the other was a type.</p>

               <p>Pharaoh perceiving himſelf croſſed in his firſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and that becauſe the more they afflicted the Iſraelites the more they multiplied and grew, he now ſeeks to bring his purpoſe to paſſe another way, andthat is by perſwading the Hebrew midwives to ſmother or ſtrangle all their male-children, a ſure way to prevent their multiplying, even in the very birth, that ſo there might be no ſuſpicion that it was purpoſely done, but that it might be aſcribed to chance, or to the womans hard labour, and difficultie of birth. Indeed ſo ſtrange it is that he ſhould hope to perſwade the midwives, if they were Iſraelites, to lend thus a helping hand to the utter deſtruction of their own people, that thereupon ſome Writers have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, that queſtionleſſe the midwives were Egyptians, and the Hebrew women were forced to make uſe of them.

And herein their faith was obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable, as the Apoſtle hath noted, becauſe out of their naturall affection to their child, quickned by the rare beauty they beheld in his countenance, they reſolved to do what they could to ſave him, <hi>being not afraid of the Kings commandment,</hi> but truſting that God would be with them, and ſo hid him three moneths; and then when they could hide him no longer, becauſe happely ſome notice was taken of it, or ſome ſtricter ſearch was to be made, they laid him out in an ark of bulruſhes, ſetting his ſiſter withall to watch what became of him.</p>

The moſt of Expoſitours do hold that Reuell this Prieſt of Midian was the grandfather of Zipporah, and the ſame that is called alſo <hi>Raguel the Midianite</hi> Num. 10. 29. Jethro, who was alſo called Hobab, was (they ſay) the father of Zipporah, and the ſonne of Reuell or Raguel, and ſo they hold that Zipporah is called the daughter of this Reuell, becauſe ſhe was his ſonne Jethro's daughter: and indeed uſually in the Scriptures grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers are called <hi>fathers,</hi> and grandchildren <hi>ſonnes and daughters;</hi> ſo Laban ſaith of his daughters children, Gen. 31. 43. <hi>Theſe children are my children;</hi> and Maachah is called <hi>the mother of Aſa,</hi> who yet was his grandmother, 1. King. 15. 13. But yet becauſe there can be no probable reaſon given, why in this place there ſhould be no mention made of the father, but of the grandfather onely, and though the grandfather be ſometimes in the Scriptures called <hi>a father,</hi> yet no inſtance can be given where in ſetting down the number of a mans daughters, it is yet meant of his grandchildren, I rather conceive that this <hi>Prieſt of Midian,</hi> here ſpoken of, that had ſeven daughters, was the father of Zipporah, and father in law of Moſes, and ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently that he had three names, Reuell as in the 18. verſe of this chapter, Jethro chap. 3. 1. and Hobab Judg. 4. 11. and that Raguel the Midianite, mentioned onely Num. 10. 29. was the father of this Reuell.</p>

               <p>That is, though theſe daughters of the Prieſt of Midian had with all diligence haſtened to the well, that they might water their flocks firſt (which happely in thoſe dry countreys they did the more earneſtly ſtrive for, becauſe thoſe that came laſt were ſometimes ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of water) yet when the ſhepherds came, they barbarouſly drove them, and their flocks away, and with the water, which theſe Virgins had drawn, ſought to water their own cattle, and ſo to make them wait till they had done: the injuſtice where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of when Moſes perceived, he ſtood up in their defence, withſtood the ſhepherds (though a ſtranger) and helped them to water their flock. Probable enough it is, conſidering in how great eſteem Moſes had lived in Egypt, that he had ſome ſervants attending him, that might aid him herein; if he were alone, there was doubtleſſe a ſpeciall hand of God in it, that one man ſhould by force prevail againſt all the ſhepherds.</p>

The other appearing of God to Moſes was in Horeb, this in Midian; but whether this his appearing to Moſes in Midian were before he asked leave to go or after, we cannot certainly conclude: if it were after that, then either Moſes, even after leave obtained from Jethro, yet haſtened not his journey as was fitting, and therefore by this ſecond apparition God quickned him again; or elſe he took it that in the firſt viſion in the burning buſh, God had onely called him to the work of going into Egypt for the deliverance of the Iſraelites, but had not expreſſely told him the time when he ſhould go, and ſo he waited till now that in this ſecond viſion in the land of Midian God again appeared to him, and commanded him immediately to go thither, adding this en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement to what he had ſaid before, that <hi>all the men were dead which ſought his life.</hi> And doubtleſſe all the time of his ſojourning with his father in law in Midian, he thought of what God had formerly revealed to him in Egypt, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Lords imploying him in that ſervice; onely he waited to ſee when God would call him thereto: and that happely might be the reaſon why in ſo many years he did not ſend to know in what condition his brethren were in Egypt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he was reſolved wholly to caſt himſelf herein upon the providence of God, and to do nothing without direction from him.</p>

                  <bibl>Verſ. 20.</bibl> And Moſes took his wife and his ſonnes, &amp;c.]</q>
               <p>Hereby it appears that Moſes either carryed his wife and his children into Egypt, or at leaſt that he was upon his journey intending to carry them with him thither: Indeed, as evident it is, when Moſes went with the Iſraelites out of Egypt, his wife and children were with his father in law in Midian: for Exod. 18. 5. it is ſaid<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that <hi>Jethro his father in law met him in the wilderneſſe when he encamped at the mount of God, and brought his wife and his ſonnes thither to him.</hi> It ſeems therefore that either when he was up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the way going thither, he ſent them back again to Jethro (perhaps upon the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of the following ſtory of the circumciſing of his ſonne) or at leaſt that when he was in Egypt, finding ſome inconvenience in their being there, he took order to return them to the ſafe cuſtodie of his father in law, that himſelf might the more freely and wholly intend the buſineſſe he had undertaken.</p>
               <q>And Moſes took the rod of God in his hand.]</q>
               <p>It was doubtleſſe the ſame rod or ſhepherds crook which Moſes uſed at other times to carry in his hand, and which he had in his hand when God ſpake to him out of the burning buſh; onely it is here called <hi>the rod of God,</hi> becauſe it was that wherewith God had appointed that Moſes

               <p>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſeverall reaſons may be given why the Iſraelites might be called Gods <hi>firſt-born ſonne,</hi> to wit, 1. to intimate how dear they were to God, even as mens firſt-born children are uſually to them; 2. in regard of their preheminence and dignity above all other Nations that were at that time upon the face of the earth; 3. with reſpect to the Gentiles, that were afterwards to become the people of God, and to be recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved into the covenant of being Gods ſonnes and daughters, the Iſraelites being firſt admitted to this peculiar priviledge of being Gods people; ſo that thoſe of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles that were afterwards received to this dignity were but as Iſraels younger bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; 4. becauſe the root of primogeniture reſted in them, in that he was to be born of this people who was to be <hi>the firſt-born among many brethren,</hi> Rom. 8. 29. But the chief reaſon, and that which I conceive was principally intended in this place is, becauſe God had choſen the Iſraelites to be his peculiar people, and heirs, as his firſt-born, of the land of Canaan, the type of the heavenly inheritance, wherein they were to live under the laws and governmeut of God unto the coming of the promiſed Meſſias: for if we mark it, this is alledged as the ground why Pharaoh was bound to let the Iſraelites go. Now their being received into a covenant of adoption did not inferre any neceſſity of being freed from Pharaohs ſervice; but Gods chuſing them to be his firſt-born people that were to inherit Canaan, and there to live under his government, could not ſtand with their continuance under the tyranny of Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh: and therefore upon this ground Pharaoh is required to diſmiſſe the Iſraelites, <hi>Iſrael is my ſonne even my firſt-born; and I ſay unto thee, Let my ſonne go that he may ſerve me,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

And this the Lord did not till now that he was upon his way going into Egypt, partly for the tryall of his faith, to ſee whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther upon this occaſion he would turn his back upon that great ſervice to which God had called him; and partly becauſe there was now a neceſſity of doing it, there being a manifeſt incongruity in it, that he ſhould undertake to be as a judge and governour of Gods circumciſed people, himſelf neglecting this badge of the covenant in his own child.</p>

               <p>The age of Moſes and Aaron is here inſerted, 1. for the further evidence of the truth of the ſtory, and the computation of the Chronologie of thoſe times; 2. to ſet forth Gods glorie the more by this intimation of the weakneſſe of his inſtruments; 3. to ſhew how long God in his wiſe providence had ſuffered the Egyptians to oppreſſe the Iſraelites with ſuch cruel bondage, even from before the birth of Moſes till he came to be <hi>foureſcore years old;</hi> and 4. the more to commend the obedience of Moſes and Aaron, that did not becauſe of their great years ſhrink from this weighty employment which God had impoſed upon them.</p>

               <p>that is, 1. They again required Pharaoh in the name of the Lord to let the children of Iſrael go out of his land; for this God had commanded Moſes and Aaron, chap. 6. 11. and it was a notable evidence of their faith and courage, that they durſt again deſire this of that proud king notwithſtanding they had ſo enraged him formerly by the firſt delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of this their meſſage, that in a furie he oppreſſed the people more then he had done before; and 2. when Pharaoh hereupon either by way of deriſion, or out of a captious device to trie what they could do, or becauſe he had heard of the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles wrought, and the Iſraelites did will them to ſhew him ſome ſigne, if they would have him know that their God had ſent them, Moſes thereupon ſpake unto Aaron to caſt his rod upon the ground, and ſaid it ſhould become a ſerpent; which Aaron accordingly did.

theſe perſons that ſhould be plagued with theſe frogs, the exempting of Iſrael ſeems to be implyed, as after it is plainly expreſſed, ver. 22. <hi>And I will ſever in that day the land of Goſhen in which my people dwell,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

               <p>The deſpicableneſſe of the creature wherewith they were annoyed did no doubt aggravate the plague.</p>

                  <bibl>Verſ. 8.</bibl> Intreat the Lord that he may take away the frogs from me, and from my people.]</q>
               <p>Though the turning of their water into bloud all the land over was doubtleſſe a very grievous plague, yet this of the frogs was more grievous then that: againſt the firſt they found ſome help, though not without great trouble, by digging for freſh water round about the river, chap. 7. 24. and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps Pharaoh and the richer ſort of his people had other ſorts of drink in ſtore for their own uſe; but now againſt this plague of the frogs, they could find no way to help or eaſe themſelves, no not the greateſt of them all<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and therefore this forced Pharaoh to ſtoop a little, and to deſire Moſes and Aaron to pray unto the Lord that he would take away their frogs from them.</p>
               <q>
                  <bibl>Verſ. 9.</bibl> And Moſes ſaid unto Pharaoh, Glory over me.]</q>
               <p>The moſt conceive this to be ſpoken of the honour which ſhould be done unto Pharaoh, that he ſhould preſcribe the time himſelf when the frogs ſhould be taken away. But I rather think that it is ſuch a kind of yielding to his deſire, wherein Moſes doth alſo imply his fear concerning the event, that Pharaoh would brag and boaſt when he had got the frogs removed, and not keep promiſe with him in letting Iſrael go.</p>
               <q>When ſhall I intreat for thee, &amp;c.]</q>
               <p>That is, that you may know that it is the mightie work of God, and that it is not by chance or by any naturall means that the frogs are deſtroyed, preſcribe the time your ſelf when they ſhall be deſtroyed, and at that very time it ſhall be done.</p>

               <q>
                  <bibl>Verſ. 14.</bibl> And they gathered them together upon heaps.]</q>
               <p>God could have dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven them into the river again, or have cauſed them to vaniſh away; but thus it pleaſed him to let them remain as a ſpectacle, unto the Egyptians, both to ſhew that it was a true miracle, and by their ill favour to put them in mind of their ſinne, that made them ſtink before God.</p>
               <q>
                  <bibl>Verſ. 16.</bibl> And the Lord ſaid unto Moſes, Say unto Aaron, &amp;c.]</q>
               <p>Becauſe Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh had mocked God, promiſing and then not performing, the Lord, to manifeſt his indignation, commands his ſervant to ſtrike now without giving him warning beforehand (as at other times) what he meant to do. <hi>Stretch out thy rod,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>and ſmite the duſt of the land, that it may become lice,</hi> &amp;c. and thus again too he trampleth on the pride of the Egyptians, puniſhing them by ſuch baſe and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible creatures.</p>

               <p>The Lord diſables them in making this ſmalleſt and baſeſt creature, for their greater confuſion; and ſo the folly of theſe their Wiſemen was made manifeſt to all men, 2. Tim. 3. 9.</p>

               <p>It ſeems to have been uſuall with Pharaoh in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to go forth unto the waters, either for his health and pleaſure, or rather of a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious mind, as attributing divine honour to the river Nilus. There therefore Moſes is appointed to meet him; both becauſe he had no acceſſe into Pharaohs pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence in his palace, and alſo that withall his threatning him with the enſuing plague might be the more publick.</p>
               <q>
                  <bibl>Verſ. 21.</bibl> Behold I will ſend ſwarms of flies upon thee, &amp;c.]</q>
               <p>That is, mixt ſwarms of waſps, hornets, and all kind of flies Pſal. 78. 45. <hi>He ſent divers ſorts of flies amongst them.</hi>
               </p>
               <q>The houſes of the Egyptians ſhall be full of ſwarms of flies, and alſo the ground whereon they are.]</q>
               <p>That is, the ground whereon the Egyptians are: the meaning is, that they ſhould be on all the land whereon the Egyptians dwelt, but not in Goſhen where the Iſraelites dwelt, as in the following verſe is expreſſed: and this exempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Iſrael is here firſt mentioned, to put Pharaoh in mind of it, as a moſt remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able thing, which if he would well think on muſt needs work upon his conſcience.</p>
               <q>
                  <bibl>Verſ. 24.</bibl> And the Lord did ſo; and there came a grievous ſwarm of flies, &amp;c.]</q>
               <p>Here is no mention of Aarons rod, and happely there was no uſe made of it, that Pharaoh might ſee the work was Gods and not mans.</p>
               <q>
                  <bibl>Verſ. 25.</bibl> Go ye, ſacrifice to your God in the land.]</q>
               <p>That is, in the land of Egypt: being terrified with this fourth plague of the ſwarms of flies, that were ſent amongſt them, Pharaoh yields at firſt thus farre, that they ſhould go and ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice unto the Lord, ſo that they went not out of Egypt. And hereby it is evident that during the time of their bondage in Egypt the Iſraelites were not ſuffered open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to offer ſacrifice to the Lord, but what they did this way they did in private ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly; as indeed it is not likely that all the time of their being in Egypt they did wholly neglect this duty of Gods worſhip and ſervice.</p>
               <q>
                  <bibl>Verſ. 26.</bibl> For we ſhall ſacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians to the Lord our God, &amp;c.]</q>
               <p>That is, that which the Egyptians abhorre to have ſacrificed: the beaſts which they worſhipped, they could not endure to kill, or ſee them killed for ſacrifice; and theſe were ſuch as the Iſraelites were to offer up in ſacrifice, namely bullocks (and the Egyptians worſhipped a certain pyed bull or calf, called Apis) and alſo ſheep and rammes, as we may ſee, Gen. 46. 34. <hi>For every ſhepherd is an abomination to the Egyptians.</hi>

               <p>This phraſe that is here uſed, <hi>go in unto Pharaoh,</hi> makes it moſt probable that when Moſes was ſent to denounce this following plague, he was not appointed to meet him at the river as formerly, but to go into his palace to him.</p>

               <p>That is, the greateſt part of all ſorts: for that all died not, is evident verſ. 19. where before the inflicting of another plague, it is ſaid, <hi>Send therefore now and gather thy cattel,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

               <p>Here is no mention made of Pharaohs deſiring Moſes prayers: Now therefore it ſeems he did not ſo farre yield as formerly, and we may well conceive that the reaſons were theſe, 1. Becauſe the cattel died preſently that were ſlain by this plague, and ſo the plague could not be removed by his prayers; and 2. Becauſe his envious heart ſwelled more then ever againſt the Iſraelites, and thereupon it is likely he reſolved to make up the loſſe they had ſuſtained in their cattel, by taking away the cattel of the Iſraelites from them, and therefore he reſolved that he would not let them go.</p>

               <p>And ſo Aaron alſo, though Moſes as the chief be here onely mentioned: for why elſe were they both appointed to take handfulls of aſhes of the furnace: As for this ſprinkling of aſhes <hi>towards the heaven,</hi> it was but onely an outward ſigne to let Pharaoh know that the enſuing plague came from the God of heaven: and the ſigne was the fitter, becauſe as they oppreſſed the Iſraelites with furnace-work in burning brick, ſo they are now puniſhed with burning ſores which came of <hi>aſhes taken out of the furnace.</hi>

               <p>That is, upon the caſting up of theſe handfulls of aſhes into the aire, there ſhall be a ſmall duſt, that ſhall fall both upon man and beaſt throughout all the land of Egypt. It is not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie, I conceive, to hold that thoſe very handfulls of aſhes were turned into ſuch a cloud of duſt, but onely that they ſhould be a ſigne of that which ſhould follow, to wit, that immediately there ſhould be ſmall duſt ſhowred down both upon man and beaſt: yet others do hold that thoſe very handfulls of aſhes, which Moſes and Aaron threw up into the aire, did miraculouſly by the mighty power of God become a cloud of ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Becauſe the Magicians could not by their enchantments bring forth lice, and were thereupon forced to acknowledge concerning that plague that it was the finger of God, chap. 8. 19. it is moſt probable that they did no more after that attempt to do the like to that which Moſes had done; and therefore in the fourth &amp; fifth plagues there hath been no mention at all made of them. But yet on the other ſide becauſe here in this ſixth plague it is plainly implyed that the Magicians were <hi>ſtanding before Moſes,</hi> it ſeems moſt probable, that even after they were ſo farre convinced by the failing of their Art in bringing forth lice, they ſtill continued to embolden Pharaoh not to be moved with thoſe things which were done, and were ſtill ready at hand to reſiſt Moſes and Aaron as farre as they could: and therefore now by the ſhame and pain of theſe boyls that roſe upon them they were driven away, and forced to give over their fighting againſt God.</p>

This Moſes might well ſay he knew, becauſe of their carriage of themſelves at preſent, in that they ſought not after the way of worſhip of the true God, but onely cryed out to have the plague ſtayed: But beſides, God had told Moſes that Pharaoh ſhould harden his heart, untill he were deſtroyed; and this he tells Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh before he prayed for him, that ſo Pharaoh might not boaſt, when the plague was gone, that he had deceived Moſes; and to let him know that he ſaw cauſe ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient why he ſhould at this time make tryall of him yet once more by praying that this plague might be removed as he deſired, though he knew beforehand that he would be never a whit the better for it.</p>

Yet probable it is, that there were ſometimes in thoſe countreys ſome kind of locuſts that killed men with their biting, and that therefore Rev. 9. 5. it is ſaid of thoſe cruel enemies of the Church, that are compared to locuſts aſcending out of the bottomleſſe pit, that, <hi>their torment was as the torment of a ſcorpion when he ſtriketh a man.</hi>

               <p>The darkneſſe threatned is here called darkneſſe that may be felt, either by way of an hyperbole to ſignifie what an exceeding great darkneſſe it ſhould be, or elſe becauſe the aire ſhould be ſo thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with groſſe miſts and vapours, that it might be felt; which in ſuch an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary horrid darkneſſe as that was might indeed well be.</p>

               <p>They ſaw not one another, becauſe neither it ſeems had they any light by ſunne moon or ſtarres from above, nor yet from fire or candle beneath, the thick clouds wherewith the aire was darkned being ſuch, that either they did put out the fire; or at leaſt wholly hide and cover it from the ſight of men. And being thus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of all light whatſoever, and that by a divine hand of judgement, no marvell though with the terrour thereof, they durſt not ſo much as move from the places where they were, as is here expreſſed. How eaſily the Iſraelites, that had light in their dwellings, might have gone away with all that they had, whileſt the Egyptians lay thus for three dayes together impriſoned in darkneſſe, we may eaſily conceive; but they had learnt to depend and wait upon God, and would not ſtirre but by his appointment.</p>

               <p>Pharaohs ſending for Moſes, and charging him not to ſee his face any more, ver. 28. argue plainly that this was done after the three dayes darkneſſe was over. But is it likely that when the plague was removed he would relent?

               <p>That therefore which follows in the next chapter, concerning the death of their firſt-born, was ſpoken immediately by Moſes at this time before he went from Pharaoh, and therefore it is ſaid, chap. 11. 8. that <hi>he went out in a great anger.</hi>

So farre were the people now encouraged, that had ere while with much bitterneſſe murmured againſt Moſes and Aaron, partly by the removing of the cloud betwixt them and the Egyptians, partly by the miraculous dividing of the ſea upon Moſes lifting up his hand over it, but chiefly by the working of Gods Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in their hearts, that Moſes leading the way, they were not afraid to follow him, notwithſtanding the terrour of the waters ſtanding up on each ſide as they went; whence it is that the Apoſtle ſaith, that <hi>by faith they paſſed through the ſea,</hi> Heb. 11. 29. and therefore it is alſo that the Apoſtle ſaith, 1. Cor. 10. 2. that <hi>they were all baptized unto Moſes in the cloud and in the ſea;</hi> to wit, becauſe the condition wherein they were, as they were led by the miniſtry of Moſes under the cloud and through the ſea, was a notable figure or repreſentation of our Baptiſme, to wit, in that as they by the cloud were covered from the heat of the ſunne, and were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned in the way they ſhould go; ſo thoſe that are baptized by the water and the Spirit of Chriſt, are covered from the burning wrath of God, and enlightned to the ſaving knowledge of the way of life: and as they in the red ſea paſſed as it were through death to life, the red ſea being the means of ſaving them, and of the deſtruction of the Egyptians; ſo Chriſt by the waters of Baptiſme, as the outward ſigne, doth ſave us, our enemies, ſinne and death, being utterly deſtroyed.</p>

               <p>Some Expoſitours conceive that hereby is meant, that in this place God gave the Iſraelites certain generall laws and ſtatutes neceſſary for the well ordering and governing of the people, untill at Sinai they ſhould be more perfectly afterwards taught concerning the whole law and will of God; which happely may be true. But yet doubtleſſe the ſtatute and ordinance chiefly, if not ſolely, here intended, is that which followeth in the next verſe, where the Lord enjoyned the people to obey him, and moves them thereto with a promiſe, that if they would ſo do, he would then protect them from the plagues of Egypt. So that this clauſe, <hi>There he made a ſtatute, and an ordinance, and there he proved them,</hi> hath reference to that which immediately after is expreſſed in the 26 verſe, <hi>And ſaid if thou wilt diligently hearken to the voice of the Lord thy God,</hi> &amp;c. and the meaning is, that after God had thus tryed them with want of water, and upon their murmuring had ſo miraculouſly healed the bitter waters of Marah, he then admoniſhed them by Moſes hereafter to take heed of this ſinne they had fallen into, and to carry themſelves more obediently towards him; and ſo made this as a ſtatute and ordinance, that if they would thus

                  <hi>do that which is right in his ſight,</hi> then he would be a gracious God unto them: and thus there he proved them, to wit, not onely by their former want, but alſo byhis pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent favourable dealing with them, not puniſhing them for their murmuring, butonely admoniſhing them, &amp; ſo making proof whether they would thereby be wonne or no.</p>

               <p>This clauſe, <hi>after their journeyes,</hi> is added, to imply that Rephidim was not the next ſtation after they went from the wilderneſſe of Sin; no, they went from Sin to Dophkah, from thence to Aluſh, and from thence to Rephidim, Numb. 33. 12, 13. 14.</p>
               <q>
                  <bibl>Verſ. 2.</bibl> Wherefore do ye tempt the Lord?]</q>
               <p>To wit, by their mutinous requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of water, as a ſigne of Gods preſence among them, <hi>ſaying, Is the Lord among us, or not?</hi> as it is afterward expreſſed verſe 7. when men, not believing the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of God, will boldly preſcribe God the time when, and the manner how, he ſhall perform his promiſes, this is called <hi>a tempting of the Lord,</hi> becauſe thereby they do, as it were, try whether he be able and faithfull to do what he hath ſaid. And thus are the Iſraelites here ſaid, <hi>to tempt the Lord.</hi> Having Gods promiſe for their ſafe convoy through the wilderneſſe to the land of Canaan, and having had already evidence enough of Gods almighty power and fatherly care over them; yet being now in ſome diſtreſſe for want of water, they came in a bold manner, and expoſtulated with Moſes and Aaron, and cried upon them to give them water, that they and theirs might not periſh with thirſt: and herein they did tempt the Lord, becauſe as the Pſalmiſt ſaith, Pſal. 78. 41. <hi>They limited the holy one of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael;</hi> they ſaid, <hi>Is the Lord among us or not?</hi> that is, the want they were in made them queſtion Gods preſence, and they reſolved now to put it upon this tryall. Let Moſes give them water, and they would acknowledge it; but if that were not done, they would not believe it. And hence was this place afterward called <hi>Maſſah,</hi> that is, <hi>temptation.</hi>
               </p>
               <q>
                  <bibl>Verſ. 4.</bibl> What ſhall I do to this people? they be almost ready to ſtone me.]</q>
               <p>Though there be no mention made in the foregoing expoſtulation of the people with Moſes, that they threatned to ſtone him; yet perhaps ſome intimation hereof might fall from ſome of the rudeſt and moſt tumultuous amongſt them: and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon Moſes might ground theſe words of his. But howſoever their behaviour being ſo full of fury as it was, he might well from hence complain to the Lord that he had juſt cauſe to fear leſt their rage ſhould at laſt break forth into this extremity.</p>
               <q>
                  <bibl>Verſ. 5.</bibl> And the Lord ſaid unto Moſes, Go on before the people, &amp;c.]</q>
               <p>That is, toward the rock Horeb: and mention is made of going before the people, for the encouragement of Moſes; as if he had ſaid, Fear them not, though they are thus en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged, they ſhall do thee no harm.</p>
               <q>And take with thee of the elders of Iſrael.]</q>
               <p>That is, all the people ſhall not go up with thee to the rock to ſee the miracle, onely ſome of the elders thou ſhalt take along with thee, that they may be eye-witneſſes of that which is to be done, and afterwards affirm the truth of what they had ſeen amongſt the people. When ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny years after this the Lord did again, after the ſame miraculous manner, give them water out of the rock, it was done openly before all the people. Numb. 20. 8. <hi>Take the rod</hi> (ſaith the Lord) <hi>and gather thou the aſſembly together, thou and Aaron thy br<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

                  <pb n="169" facs="tcp:103385:90"/>
                  <hi>water:</hi> and this makes ſome queſtion, why God would not have it ſo now, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that ſome few of the elders go up with Moſes to ſee the miracle wrought. But ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there is no reaſon given for it in the text, it is ſufficient for us to ſay, that God in his wiſdome ſaw it fit to have it ſo: yet the moſt probable reaſon that can be given is this, That God ordered it ſo the better to try the faith of his people, and therefore having determined that the rock ſhould give forth water in ſome hollow place, where the entrance and paſſage into the rock was not wide enough that the whole multitude of the people might come in to ſee the miracle wrought, he onely enjoyned that ſome of the elders ſhould go up with Moſes to be eye-witneſſes of what was done, the reſt of the people waiting below till the ſtreams of the water came ruſhing down amongſt them, as it is expreſſed Pſal. 78. 1. 5, 16. <hi>He clave the rocks in the wilderneſſe, and gave them water as out of the great depths: he brought ſtreams alſo out of the rock, and cauſed waters to runne down like rivers.</hi>
               </p>
               <q>And thy rod wherewith thou ſmoteſt the river, take in thine hand and go, &amp;c.]</q>
               <p>That is, the rod wherevvith thou ſmoteſt the river Nilus in Egypt, when the waters thereof vvere turned into bloud. See Exod. 7. 20.</p>
               <q>
                  <bibl>Verſ. 6.</bibl> Behold, I will ſtand before thee there, upon the rock in Horeb.]</q>
               <p>Hereby it is evident that vvhen Moſes came to the rock, there vvas there ſome viſible ſigne of Gods glorious preſence to be ſeen there upon the rock (though vvhat it vvas the Scriptures being ſilent vve cannot affirm) vvhich doubtleſſe did vvondrouſly ſtrengthen the faith of Moſes and the elders that vvere vvith him.</p>
               <q>And Moſes did ſo in the ſight of the elders of Iſrael.]</q>
               <p>That is, he ſtruck the rock, and immediately the waters guſhed forth. And thus the Iſraelites had not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly water for the quenching of their thirſt, and that not for the preſent onely, but for ſome good time after, the ſtream of water that brake out of the rock becoming a river that ranne along in this deſert unto ſeverall places, where after this they had their ſtations (whence it is that the Apoſtle ſaith, that this <hi>rock followed them,</hi> meaning the water that guſhed out of this rock) but withall in the rock, and the waters iſſuing from thence they had an extraordinary ſacramentall ſigne or type of Chriſt, and the benefits that redound to poore ſinners by him. For ſo the Apoſtle ſaith, 1. Cor. 10. 4. <hi>They did all drink the ſame ſpirituall drink (for they drank of the ſpirituall rock that followed them, and that rock was Christ)</hi> For as that rock in the wilderneſſe, being ſtruck by the rod of Moſes, gave forth waters for the quench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Iſraelites thirſt; ſo Chriſt upon the croſſe, being ſmitten with the rod of Moſes, the curſe of the law, yields forth, both in his righteouſneſſe and the ſpirit of grace derived to believers from him, that living water, wherewith their dry and thirſty ſouls are refreſhed ſo that they <hi>ſhall never thirſt again,</hi> as our Saviour ſaith, John 4. 16.</p>
               <q>
                  <bibl>Verſ. 8.</bibl> Then came Amalek, and fought with Iſrael, &amp;c.]</q>
               <p>That is, the poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Amalek, a Duke of the poſterity of Eliphaz, the ſonne of Eſau, Gen. 36. 15. For fear leſt the huge army of the Iſraelites ſhould have paſſed through their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, they came out to reſiſt them, and lying in ambuſh, <hi>ſmote the hindermoſt of them, even all that were feeble behind thee,</hi> Deut. 25. 18.</p>

               <p>This could not be that Hur the ſonne of Caleb, who was but fourtie years old when he ſearched the land of Canaan. If we may credit Joſephus, he was the husband of Miriam, Moſes and Aarons <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <q>
                  <bibl>Verſ. 11.</bibl> And it came to paſſe when Moſes held up his hand, that Iſrael pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed, &amp;c.]</q>
               <p>And this lifting up of his hands was chiefly to hold forth the rod as an enſigne to ſtrengthen the faith of the ſouldiers; but yet withall it ſerved to expreſſe the lifting up of his heart in prayer to God, the lifting up of the hands being the uſuall geſture of one that prayes: ſo that this different ſucceſſe of the Iſraelites, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companying the different geſture of Moſes body, was purpoſely by the providence of God appointed to be a reall expreſſion both how forcible Moſes prayers were, and alſo how weak the Iſraelites were in themſelves, if God (of whoſe aſſiſtance the rod was a ſigne) ſhould not ſtand on their ſides.</p>
               <q>
                  <bibl>Verſ. 12.</bibl> But Moſes hands were heavy, and they took a ſtone and put it under him, &amp;c.]</q>
               <p>Which ſhows that he was weary with ſtanding ſo long, as well as with lifting up his hands.</p>
               <q>And Aaron and Hur ſtayed up his hands, &amp;c.]</q>
               <p>The common opinion is, that Moſes held up the rod of God in both his hands, and that his hands were weary at length, and ſo ſometimes ſinking down not ſo much through his weakneſſe by reaſon of age (for fourty years after this <hi>his naturall force was not abated,</hi> Deut. 34. 7.) as by the continuall labour of reaching up his hands ſo long together, and that too when his ſpirits were happely ſpent much with the vehemency of his ſpirit in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Lord: Aaron and Hur perceiving th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

But becauſe we cannot well conceive but that they would have been all wearied if it had been thus; I conceive it more probable, that Moſes held up the rod in one hand, ſhifting it as occaſion was from one hand to another; And ſo Aaron, and Hur in their turns helped to bear up that hand which was next to them, and had by their turns a time to reſt and eaſe themſelves.</p>

Evident therefore it is that though the removing of the Iſraelites from Rephidim (where they vanquiſhed the Amalekites) to the deſert of Sinai, where this mount of God was, be not mentioned till the beginning of the following chapter, yet thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they were removed before Jethro came to them.</p>

Now the charge that is here given Moſes particularly concerning them, is not meant of that which before was enjoyed all the people, ver. 10. that they might be prepared in a holy manner to preſent them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves before the Lord, which doubtleſſe the prieſts did then obſerve no leſſe then the reſt of the people; but of a peculiar watching over themſelves, to keep them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves clean from all pollutions, and particularly from being defiled with ſinne by touching the mount, which happely they might have been the bolder to do in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of their prieſthood, if there had not been a ſpeciall charge given to them.</p>

<pb n="176" facs="tcp:103385:94"/>
but by way of further enquiry concerning Gods will: for hearing that charge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain repeated, Moſes began to bethink himſelf whether he had not omitted ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of that which was before given him in charge, &amp; ſo in an humble manner pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth how carefully, to his beſt knowledge, he had done what God had command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the reſtraining of the people from touching the mount, covertly intimating hereby his deſire to be further informed, if he had hitherto omitted any thing which ought to have been done.</p>

               <p>Divers wayes the Hebrews came to be ſold for ſervants to their brethren: for 1. ſometimes being condemned for theft, they were ſold by the judges, that ſo ſatisfaction might be made to the owner for the goods they had ſtollen, if otherwiſe they were not able to make ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, chap. 22. 3. <hi>If he have nothing, he ſhall be ſold for his theft;</hi> 2. by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of poverty they might ſell their children for ſervants, as is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>vident in the 12. verſe of this chapter; or themſelves, Lev. 25. 39. <hi>And if thy brother that dwelleth by thee be waxen poore, and be ſold unto thee,</hi> &amp;c. 3. in caſe of debt which they were not able to pay, they and their children might be ſold as ſervants, for ſatisfaction of the debt; whence is that complaint of the poore widow, 2. King. 4. 1. <hi>The cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditour is come to take unto him my two ſonnes to be bondmen;</hi> and that in the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, Mat. 18. 25. <hi>For as much as he had not to pay, his Lord commanded him to be ſold, and his wife, and children, and all that he had, and payment to be made.</hi> Now in all theſe caſes, here is a law given concerning the time of their ſervice, namely that they ſhould ſerve thoſe that had bought them onely ſix years, and that in the ſeventh year they ſhould ſet them free. Elſewhere it is evident, that if the year of Jubile fell within the compaſſe of thoſe ſix years, their ſervants were then alſo to be ſet free, though it were but a year after they had bought them, Lev. 25. 40, 41. but otherwiſe, they were to ſerve them ſix years, as here is expreſſed. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny learned Expoſitours, indeed the moſt, conceive that the ſeventh year, wherein the Hebrew ſervants were to be ſet free, was the Sabbaticall year, or the year of releaſe, which was every ſeventh year, at which time they were to ſet free their ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, how lately ſoever they had bought them: And if we thus underſtand this
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:103385:95"/>
place, then the meaning of theſe words is this, <hi>If thou buy an Hebrew ſervant, ſix years he ſhall ſerve,</hi> that is, ſix years is the utmoſt he ſhall at any time ſerve thee, <hi>and in the ſeventh he ſhall go out free for nothing,</hi> that is, when the ſeventh year, the Sabbaticall year, comes, then however he ſhall go out free for nothing. But 1. becauſe where the Scripture ſpeaks of this Sabbaticall year, or year of releaſe, as in the 25. chapter of Leviticus, and in the fifteenth chapter of Deuteronomie, we find no expreſſe Law given for the ſetting free of ſervants; and 2. becauſe accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to this expoſition of this Law their ſervants could never ſerve them ſix years, unleſſe they were ſold to be ſervants immediately after the end of the Sabbaticall year, and it ſeems manifeſt that this clauſe, <hi>ſix years he ſhall ſerve,</hi> is more generall then ſo, therefore I rather think that the ſetting free ſervants before they had ſerved ſix years was the peculiar priviledge of the year of Jubile, which was every fiftieth year; and that the ſeventh year in this Law intended, when they were to be ſet free, was alwayes counted from the year when they were firſt ſold to be ſervants. Now the reaſon why the Lord would not have the Iſraelites ſerve any longer, is expreſſed elſewhere, Lev. 25. 55. to wit, becauſe they were Gods ſervants, and ſo the Lord would teach them to put a difference betwixt his people, and others that were not his people. And though there is mention made here onely of ſervants bought with money, yet if they became any other way ſervants to their brethren, as by being taken in the warre, when there came to be any civill warre amongſt them, it is probable that by the rule of Analogy this law was extended even to them alſo.</p>

               <p>And ſo alſo by the rules of Analogy we may gather, that if he brought children with him, thoſe children ſhould alſo go out with him.</p>
               <q>
                  <bibl>Verſ. 4.</bibl> If his Master have given him a wife, &amp;c.]</q>
               <p>Here is an exception added to the former law, concerning the ſetting free of the wife together with the husband, to wit, that <hi>if his Maſter have given him a wife,</hi> in the time of his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice (namely one of his maidſervants, either an Hebrew woman, or ſtranger, both the manſervant and maidſervant conſenting thereto) <hi>and ſhe have born him ſonnes or daughters,</hi> in this caſe the man was to be ſet free alone by himſelf, and his wife and children were to continue ſtill ſervants to his Maſter. Nor yet can we hence inferre, That God approved any mans forſaking his wife: for doubtleſſe that Law ſtood firm which God had eſtabliſhed from the beginning, that a man muſt leave all and cleave to his wife, Gen. 2. 24. and that the bond of marriage ſhould be kept alwayes inviolable, <hi>What God hath joyned together let no man put aſunder.</hi> But for the reſolving of this doubt, we muſt conſider, firſt, that in ſome caſes this might be onely a parting with mutuall conſent for a time, becauſe if his wife were a daughter of Iſrael, bought with money, ſhe alſo was to be ſet free at the end of her ſix years ſervice, if the year of Jubile did not happen before (Deut. 15. 12. <hi>If thy brother, an Hebrew man, or an Hebrew woman, be ſold unto thee, and ſerve thee ſix years, then in the ſeventh year thou ſhalt let them go free from thee)</hi> and then might ſhe return unto her husband: Secondly, that no man was by this law forced to leave his wife; by continuing in his former ſervice, he might ſtill enjoy her:
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:103385:96" rendition="simple:additions"/>
onely God takes order that when himſelf is ſet free, he muſt not think under that pretence to deprive his Maſter of her that was his lawfull ſervant, but ſhould rather endure the inlarging of his own bondage, that he might enjoy her. Thirdly, that this liberty given to a ſervant ſet free to go away, and leave his wife behind him, was not an approbation of his forſaking the wife he had taken: at the moſt, it was but a part or branch of that ſcope wherein this people were left to themſelves, <hi>for the hardneſſe of their hearts,</hi> as Chriſt ſaith in another caſe, Matth. 19. 8. and fourthly, That if the wife, given him in the time of his ſervice, was a ſtranger of another na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and happely of another religion, theſe marriages were never pleaſing to God; and it was his fault that he would yield to marry ſuch a one.</p>

               <p>To wit, that his Maſter might prove it fairly and openly, that it was his ſervants free and voluntary act to continue with him.</p>
               <q>His Maſter ſhall bore his eare through with an aul, and he ſhall ſerve him for ever.]</q>
               <p>That is, all his life time, to wit, unleſſe the yeare of Jubile fall in the mean time: for then indeed all Hebrew ſervants were abſolutely ſet free together with their children, Levit. 25. 40, 41. Now for the boring of his eare to the doore, or to the doore-poſt of his Maſters houſe, it was happely partly to ſhadow forth how blame-worthy they are that preferre not the liberty of the Goſpel before the bondage of the law; but doubtleſſe the main reaſon was, that his bored eare might be an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence concerning ſuch a ſervant, that he had voluntarily diſclaimed the priviledge that God had granted him of being ſet free at the end of ſix years ſervice: it was not ſo much a puniſhment inflicted, as a mark ſet upon him to witneſſe his conſent to perpetuall ſervice, and the miſery thereof. And indeed a fit ſigne it was to ſignifie this. The eare is the embleme of obedience; becauſe they that are obedient, are willingly ready to hearken to the commands of their ſuperiours, that ſo they may do what is enjoyned. The boring therefore of his eare was to ſignifie that he was now tyed to his Maſters houſe, and that as a ſervant he would be ready alwayes to hearken to his voice in all he ſhould give him in charge: whence is that phraſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the obedience of Chriſt, Pſal. 40. 6. <hi>Sacrifice and offering thou didſt not deſire: mine eares haſt thou opened, or, bored through,</hi> as the word in the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall ſignifies.</p>

               <p>That is, ſhe ſhall not alwayes be tyed to ſix years ſervice as the menſervants are, as is made evident by ſome particular exceptions which are added in the following verſes: This courſe of parents ſelling their children is by many reckoned amongſt thoſe things which God did not approve but tolerate in this people, <hi>becauſe of the hardneſſe of their hearts.</hi> However Lord did here provide that in caſe parents, conſtrained perhaps by extreme neceſſity, ſhould ſell their children, if it were a daughter which they ſold, <hi>ſhe ſhould not go out as the menſervants do:</hi> and the meaning, I ſay, is onely this, that the Law concerning the ſetting free of ſuch a maidſervant ſhould not be in all reſpects alike with that of menſervants, as namely becauſe though ordinarily maidſervants were to be ſet free alſo at ſix years end, Deut. 15. 12, &amp;c. yet ſometimes they were to be freed before
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:103385:96"/>
their ſix years ſervice was ended (which menſervants never were) as appears by thoſe caſes propounded in the following verſes.</p>

                  </gap> betroth her to himſelf, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards diſlike her, and ſo repenting of what he hath done will not take her to be his wife (which was likewiſe one of thoſe things which God did tolerate in this people, but not approve) he muſt let her be redeemed, that is, he muſt not think to keep her ſtill to be a ſervant, or ſell her to be a ſervant to others; at leaſt he muſt procure her to be redeemed, either by her ſelf, or by her kindred, or by ſome other that would take her to be his wife. In which caſe doubtleſſe order was taken by the Judges, that it ſhould be done at a very reaſonable price: for though the next clauſe may ſeem to imply, that he was onely reſtrained from ſelling her to one that was not an Iſraelite, <hi>To ſell her unto a ſtrange nation he ſhall have no power;</hi> yet ſince they might not do that to any Iſraelite ſervant whatſoever, therefore by <hi>a ſtrange nation</hi> here is meant (as Calvin takes it) any of another family, though an Hebrew; or elſe his ſelling her to a ſtrange nation is onely expreſſely forbidden, becauſe the Hebrews would not buy her, knowing it to be contrary to Gods law. And indeed the like favour is granted to a ſervant whom her Maſter had marryed, though ſhe were not an Iſraelite: for concerning ſuch a one the law was, Deut. 21. 14. that her Maſter ſhould <hi>let her go whither ſhe would, but ſhould not ſell her and make merchandiſe of her, becauſe he had humbled her.</hi>

               <p>Now another caſe is propounded, What ſhall be done, if a man having betrothed his ſervant to himſelf, or to his ſonne (for both may be here underſtood) do not in diſlike caſt her off, but take him another wife? This we muſt not think God approves of, onely he tolerates it for the hardneſſe of their hearts; but in this caſe he provides that the true wife be not wronged, <hi>Her food, her raiment, and her duty of marriage ſhall he not diminiſh,</hi> which laſt clauſe may be meant of dowry, and all other things due by marriage covenant; but doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe that which S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Paul calls <hi>due benevolence,</hi> 1.

                     </gap>e;</hi> ſo that by comparing them together we may ſee, firſt, That though this place ſpeaks generally of ſtealing <hi>a man,</hi> yet it is meant onely of ſtealing thoſe that were their brethren of Iſrael: There was doubtleſſe ſome puniſhment inflicted on thoſe that
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:103385:97" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſtole ſervants that were ſtrangers of another nation, to wit, according to the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of other thefts (for their ſervants were their money) but it was onely the ſtealing of Iſraelites, whether men or women, that was puniſhed with death: ſecondly, That whereas it is ſaid here, <hi>He that ſtealeth a man and ſelleth him, or if he be found in his hand, he ſhall ſurely be put to death,</hi> the meaning is not, that though the manſtealer had not yet ſold his brother whom he had ſtollen, but had him ſtill in his own poſſeſſion, he ſhould notwithſtanding be put to death, no leſſe then if he had ſold him (for the law in Deuteronomi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

By all which we may likewiſe ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther what a grievous ſinne it is to bring men into the worſe bondage of ſinne and Satan, or of ſubjecting the conſcience of Gods people to be in thraldome to men, of which the Apoſtle ſpeaks, 1.

               <p>This was the law amongſt the Hebrews, which we call the law of Retaliation, whereby the Magiſtrate was authoriſed to puniſh man that had done voluntarily any hurt to their neighbours, according to the hurt which they had done them: And it was doubtleſſe moſt equall<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as thoſe times were, and frequently practiſed amongſt them; yet withall very probable it is that it was in the Judges power in ſome caſes to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low a change or commutation of this penalty, and in ſtead of this to award a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niary mulct or fine of money: firſt, Becauſe in ſome caſes the law of retaliation could not be equall; as for example, If a man that had but one eye ſhould put out one of his neighbours eyes, the putting out of this mans onely eye in l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>As before concerning dead goods, ſo here con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning cattel committed to the keeping of a friend, the Law appoints how the judges muſt determine, to wit, that in caſe ſuch cattel die, or be hurt, or by force driven, not ſtollen away, no man ſeeing it, but the keepers; becauſe thoſe loſſes are not to be prevented by the keepers care, therefore the owner moſt bear them.</p>

               <p>Dead goods ſtollen from the keeper were not to be made good to the owner, ver. 8. yet cattel muſt be reſtored: the reaſon is, firſt, becauſe there might be ſome neglect in keeping cattel abroad, which cannot be ſo likely of things laid up in a mans dwelling houſe: ſecondly, it is moſt likely they were paid for keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cattel (becauſe it required watching and charge) and then it was juſt they ſhould make it good, through whoſe neglect it was ſtollen away. Whence is that of Jacob, Gen. 31. 39. <hi>Of my hand didſt thou require it, whether ſtollen by day, or ſtollen by night.</hi>

               <p>The Law here concerning things borrowed that are loſt or hurt whileſt they were with the borrower is this, That if the owner were by when the thing borrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed did miſcarry the borrower ſhould not make it good, becauſe the owners preſence
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:103385:99"/>
made it manifeſt that the miſchief could not be prevented; But if the owner were not by, then the borrower was to make it good. Nor was the ſeverity of this branch of the Law unequall. For however it might miſcarry without any neglect of the borrower though the owner was not by, yet it was fit that ſuch a penalty ſhould by Law be impoſed to prevent all fraudulent dealing in the borrower, and to make him the more circumſpectly carefull of the thing he borrows; and ſo likewiſe by this means men had the more encouragement to lend freely.</p>

                  <bibl>Verſ. 16.</bibl> If a man entice a maid that is not betrothed, and lie with her, &amp;c.]</q>
               <p>If a maid were betrothed, it was death to lie with her, Deut. 22. 23, 24. <hi>If a damſel that is a virgin be betrothed unto an husband, and a man find her in the city, and lie with her; ye ſhall ſtone them with ſtones that they die:</hi> but this Law is concerning the defiling of a maid that is not betrothed, in which caſe it is here provided that if a man entice a maid, either by promiſe of marriage, or otherwiſe, and lie with her, he was to endow her, and marry her; and in caſe her father re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed to let him marrie her, he was then to pay her a ſumme of money, <hi>according to the dowry of virgins,</hi> that is, according to her eſtate and condition, as dowries uſed to be given with maids of like parentage and eſtate. There is another Law much like this, Deut. 22. 28, 29. to wit, that if a man did find a damſel, a virgin not betrothed, and did lay hold on her and lie with her, and they were found, he was then to marry her, and might never aſterwards put her away, and was withall to pay unto the maids father fifty ſhekels of ſilver. To ſhew the diſference betwixt theſe two Laws, ſome ſay that this here is meant of ſuch as by enticing maids did perſwade them to conſent and ſo lie with them; but that the Law in Deuteronomie is meant of ſuch as did defile maids without their conſent, &amp; that therefore a greater penalty is allotted to thoſe there, then to theſe here that had the conſent of the maids they defiled. But becauſe it is moſt probable that violent rapes, where the maid no way conſented, were alwayes amongſt this people puniſhed with death, therefore I cannot think that that Law in Deuteronomie is meant of thoſe that ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhed maids: Rather the difference betwixt theſe Laws conſiſts in this, That in that place of Deuteronomie the Law ſpeaks of defiling maids<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that being occaſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally laid hold on, yielded preſently to the luſt of him that defiled them, not being beforehand allured and perſwaded by degrees; and that this ſpeaks of ſuch as did entice maids with promiſe of marriage, and ſo defiled them; and in this caſe the Law is not ſo ſevere. Indeed here nor there is there any puniſhment at all appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the woman, though her ſinne was great; and that becauſe beſides that the loſſe of her virginitie was a brand of ignominy to her, and the hope of marriage might chiefly deceive her, being under her fathers power, and having nothing of her own, ſhe could not be chargeable with paying any mulct of money.</p>

But however all this muſt be underſtood of the pawns of poore people, that had not variety, and ſo were forced to pawn thoſe things which they could not be well without when the time came that they were to uſe them; and not of rich men that had variety, as is evident, Deut. 24. 12. <hi>If the man be poore thou ſhalt not ſleep with his pledge;</hi> where alſo another Law is given con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning pawns, ver. 10, 11. to wit, that the lender might not go into his brothers houſe, and take what pawn he pleaſed, but muſt ſtand abroad, and take that pledge which ſhould be brought out to him.</p>

they are Gods Vicegerents upon earth, and they have as it were an impreſſion of Gods majeſty upon them, in whoſe ſtead they are, and whoſe name they bear. And hence I conceive it is evident that S.

               <p>This reſtraint of the Iſraelites from eating that which was torn of beaſts was, 1. becauſe all fleſh of beaſts that was not rightly purified from the bloud was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean by the Law; 2. becauſe the bodies of clean cattel became legally unclean by being torn by wild beaſts of prey which were all unclean; and 3. to teach the Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites by abhorring the fleſh of beaſts thus killed, to abhorre all rapine and cruelty, as ſinnes moſt odious in the ſight of God.</p>

Yet I ſee not why this place may not be underſtood generally of all ſacrifices; ſince it is evident, firſt, that leaven was forbidden in all meat-offerings, which were alwayes offered together with their ſacrifices: Levit. 2. 11. <hi>No meat-offering which ye ſhall bring unto the Lord ſhall be made with leaven; for ye ſhall burn no leaven, nor any honey in any offering of the Lord made by fire.</hi> And ſecondly, that though the fleſh of ſome ſacrifices might be eaten the next day, yet the fat thereof was to be preſently burnt upon the altar.

                  </gap>e are two that have moſt proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility in them: the one is, that the Urim and Thummim are no other but thoſe very rowes of pretious ſtones, before mentioned, that were in the breaſtplate, and are here called Urim and Thummim, not onely becauſe of their brightneſſe and perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but eſpecially alſo with reſpect unto their uſe, which was, that by them the high prieſt did inquire of God for the people, and was by the ſpeciall inſpiration of the Spirit enabled to return them an anſwer, which did accordingly come to paſſe: and hence it is, they ſay, that in the thirty ninth chapter, where Moſes doth exactly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late how all things were made according to Gods appointment, there is no mention made of the Urim and Thummim, but onely of the twelve pretious ſtones ſet in the breaſtplate, becauſe theſe ſtones, ſet in two rowes, were uſually called among the people the Urim and Thummim in regard of their uſe, the high prieſts enquiring of God by them and returning a perfect anſwer to thoſe demands that were made to him. And indeed this I ſhould readily imbrace for truth, but that one thing onely makes it doubtfull, to wit, that it is ſaid the workmen did ſet the ſtones in the breaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate, chap. 39. 10. whereas Moſes put in the Urim and Thummim, Levit. 8. 8. The other opinion is, that theſe very words, <hi>Urim and Thummim,</hi> were written in ſome pretious matter, not made by humane art, but by the almighty power of God, and ſo were given by God to Moſes, and by him put within the fold of the pectorall, Levit. 8. 8. <hi>Alſo he put in the breastplate the Urim and Thummim.</hi> And therefore this is not mentioned amongſt thoſe things that were made by the artificers, becauſe this was, as the tables of the Law, the work of God and not of man: This alſo is
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:103385:111"/>
very probable, but yet a conjecture onely; neither can we (the Scripture being ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent) certainly determine what they were. When the Jews returned out of Babylon they were loſt, and therefore ſome buſineſſes hung in ſuſpenſe, Ezra 2. 63. <hi>Till there ſtood up a prieſt with Urim and Thummim;</hi> neither do we find in any of the Jewiſh Rabbins that they themſelves did certainly know what they were.</p>

from the reſt of the ſacrifice, and given to the prieſts for their portion, Levit. 7. 31, 32. <hi>The breaſt ſhall be Aarons and his ſonnes; and the right ſhoulder ſhall ye give unto the prieſt for an heave-offering of the ſacrifice of your peace-offerings.</hi> But here the breaſt onely was given to Moſes, as he that extraordinarily did now the prieſts work; the ſhoulder was together with the fat and other things waved by the prieſts, and then by Moſes burnt upon the altar: and the reaſon was doubtleſſe, becauſe there were many prieſts among whom the breaſt and ſhoulder were in fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture times divided, whereas here onely Moſes executed now the work of the prieſt, and therefore the breaſt alone was given unto him for his portion, and the ſhoulder was burnt upon the altar, and offered to the Lord.</p>

But now others again conceive it to be the more probable opinion, that this was required to be done by Moſes onely for the preſent, Firſt, becauſe there is no mention made of the perpetuity of this ordinance, as there is of other things that were to be for ever obſerved: Secondly, becauſe the Lord ſaith not here, <hi>Whenſoever the children of Iſrael are numbred,</hi> but, <hi>When thou takeſt the ſumme of the children of Iſrael after their number,</hi> as ſpeaking of a thing that was immediately to be done by Moſes: Thirdly, becauſe the end of this collection men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned was extraordinary not perpetuall, namely for the building of the tabernacle, as is evident, Exod. 38. 25, 26, 27, 28. in regard whereof it is ſaid here verſ. 16. that it ſhould be <hi>a memoriall unto the children of Iſrael before the Lord:</hi> Fourthly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe where there is mention made of Moſes numbring the Iſraelites at other times, as Numb. 1. 26. there is no mention made of the payment of this half ſhekel by every one that was numbred: Fifthly, becauſe there was another rate ſet by Nehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah to be paid yearly by every one for the ſervice of the houſe of God, to wit, the third part of a ſhekel, Nehemiah 10. 33. The truth is, that neither of theſe can be demonſtratively proved: But yet evident it is that though they did not conſtantly pay this tribute-money in future times when they were numbred, yet at leaſt upon the like occaſion this poll-money was at other times raiſed, becauſe we reade, 2. King. 12. 4. that Jehoaſh king of Judah commanded the prieſts to gather of the people for the repair of the Temple, <hi>the money of every one that paſſeth the account,</hi> which is called in 2.

               <p>When they are numbred each payeth a ranſome for his ſoul: Firſt, by way of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage: Princes uſe to take tribute-money by poll, and to that end are wont to num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber their people; Iſrael therefore being numbred muſt pay this as a tribute-money, acknowledging thereby Gods dominion over them, and that by right of redemption, becauſe he had redeemed them out of the houſe of bondage, and ſo had bound them to be his ſervants: Secondly, by way of thankfull acknowledgement that it was of him that they were multiplied ſo exceedingly, according to his promiſe made to their fathers, that their ſeed ſhould be as the ſtarres for number; as likewiſe, that he
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:103385:116"/>
did by his good providence keep an accompt as it were of every particular perſon amongſt them, and watch over them for their good and ſafety: thirdly, by way of expiation, becauſe when they came to be thus particularly viſited and looked into of God, they could not eſcape deſtruction by reaſon of their ſinnes, ſhould he deal with them according to juſtice; and therefore there muſt a ranſome be paid, the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther becauſe pride and preſumption and many other infirmities do uſually accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany the numbring of a people, as we ſee in the example of David, 2. Sam. 24. Yet we muſt not think that ſo ſmall a price as here was paid by every man for his ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome was any meet ſatisfaction to Gods juſtice; but onely hereby they were taught to judge themſelves, and to acknowledge a greater ranſome that was to be paid, whereof this was a kind of type, even the Lord Chriſt Jeſus, who was <hi>himſelf a ranſome for all to be testified in due time,</hi> 1.

               <p>This was that which every Iſraelite paid for his ranſome when they were numbred. The gerah is held to have been about a penny half penny, and by that eſtimate the ſhekel was two ſhillings and ſix pence, and half the ſhekel fifteen pence; and it is expreſſed that they ſhould give <hi>half a ſhekel after the ſhekel of the Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary,</hi> either becauſe the ſhekel of the Sanctuary was twice as much as the common ſhekel, the common ſhekel being but ten gerahs, but the ſhekel of the Sanctuary twenty, as is here expreſſed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which is indeed the common opinion; or rather be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the ſtandard of all weights and meaſures was kept in the Sanctuary, and ſo the injoyning of them to give half a ſhekel after the ſhekel of the Sanctuary, was nothing elſe but that they ſhould give a true half ſhekel, of the full weight and value, after the ſtandard of the Sanctuary. And indeed Ezek. 45. 10, 11, 12. where the Prophet exhorts the Princes of Iſrael to uſe none but juſt weights and meaſures, ſpeaking of thoſe that were commonly uſed among the people, he gives direction as here, that the ſhekel ſhould contain twenty gerahs.</p>

That all the people brake off their golden eare-rings, &amp;c. becauſe the multitude were all in a manner combined together, and but a few to ſpeak of there were that kept themſelves clear in this generall deſertion.</p>
               <q>And they ſaid unto Aaron, Up, make us Gods, &amp;c.]</q>
               <p>This word doth imply both how violently they preſſed him, and with what importunity they haſtened him to do what they required; as if they had ſaid, We have waited long enough for Moſes, and therefore diſpatch quickly, and with all ſpeed do what we require: <hi>make us Gods to go before us,</hi> that is, images as repreſentations of God, or viſible ſignes of Gods going before them, and preſence amongſt them. It cannot be reaſonably thought that the people were ſo ſtupid as to think that any thing made by mans hand could be the God that brought them out of Egypt, but onely that they deſired ſome image as a ſigne of Gods preſence, according to the manner of their idolatry in Egypt. Yea happely conceiving the cloud not to move, they took themſelves to be forſaken or betrayed by Moſes, and ſo in their rage fall into this idolatry, as it were in deſpight of Moſes and Aaron. And therefore we ſee alſo in what a diſcontented manner, and how contemptuouſly they ſpeak of Moſes in the following words, <hi>As for this Moſes, the man that brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we wot not what is become of him.</hi>

Yea, it is probable enough that Aaron made this demand of their eare-rings, not gold in generall, with ſome ſecret hope that the womens unwillingneſſe to part with theſe ornaments, wherein they were wont ſo much to delight, might be a rub in the way.</p>

               <q>And made the children of Iſrael drink of it.]</q>
               <p>How this was done we may reade Deut. 9. 21. where it is ſaid that he caſt the duſt of their idol into the brook that deſcended out of the mount, which was the onely water they had in that place: for we muſt not think that Moſes gave to every one of the people a draught of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter wherein he had firſt put ſome of the powder or duſt of their idol; but therefore onely is it ſaid that <hi>he made the children of Iſrael drink of it,</hi> becauſe he caſt it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the water whereof they drank daily. Now this was done, 1. to make them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed of their golden God, which muſt come to be their food firſt, and excrements afterwards; 2. to terrifie them by cauſing them to drink as it were the matter of their damnation.</p>
               <q>

               <p>As one that would have ſaid, if he durſt, that the calf came out beſide his intention. I do not think Aaron hoped or meant to perſwade Moſes to this; but fain he would have ſaid ſomething in his excuſe, if he knew what; and therefore being inexcuſable, by a poore dry and ſlender narration he ſeeks however to colour and extenuate the fact.</p>

               <q>
                  <bibl>Verſ. 26.</bibl> Then Moſes ſtood in the gate of the camp, &amp;c.]</q>
               <p>A place of enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance into the camp where he ſtood, 1. becauſe it was (as afterward in cities) the place of judgement; 2. becauſe the avengers were to paſſe from gate to gate; 3. as withdrawing himſelf from a curſed people; as for the ſame cauſe he did the like, Exod. 33. 7.</p>
               <q>Who is on the Lords ſide? let him come unto me.]</q>
               <p>When Moſes uſed theſe words, in ſummoning thoſe to come in that ſhould be imployed in puniſhing the people, his meaning doubtleſſe was that thoſe that had not conſented to this wicked fact of the people (though even they alſo had ſinned, becauſe for fear they did not oppoſe themſelves) but did ſincerely and ſeriouſly deteſt what was done, and grieve for it, and would now therefore take Gods part againſt the offenders, to do in this cauſe what God ſhould require, ſhould aſſemble themſelves together and come unto him.</p>

               <p>The Levites onely came, or at leaſt they together with the reſt that were innocent came, and that by ſpeciall inſtinct of Gods ſpirit, who had appointed them to the prieſthood. And they came all, that is, in a manner all; for ſome of them were puniſhed with the reſt, Deut. 33. 9. <hi>Who ſaid unto his father and his mother, I have not ſeen him: neither did he acknowledge his brethren, nor knew his own children.</hi>

               <p>That is, Moſes commanded the Levites that as they went through the camp, from one gate to the other, they ſhould ſlay all they met with, or rather all the ring-leaders and principall offenders in this great tranſgreſſion (who were well known, and would be buſie abroad whileſt the penitent for ſhame kept within) not ſparing for favour either brother, companion or neighbour, or any other that were deareſt unto them. Now where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as it may be objected<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that if they were appointed to ſlay all they met with, there would be danger of killing ſome that were guiltleſſe: To this is anſwered, 1. that happely when Moſes proclaimed, <hi>Who is on the Lords ſide? let him come unto me,</hi> all that were clean of this ſinne gathered themſelves unto Moſes though the coming of the Levites unto him be onely expreſſed in the text, becauſe they were the men that were afterward imployed in puniſhing the offenders; and if this were ſo there could be no danger in ſlaying the innocent: 2. that God, who injoyned this, did by his providence ſo order it that none but the guilty ſhould come in their way to be ſlain by them.</p>
               <q>
                  <bibl>Verſ. 29.</bibl> For Moſes had ſaid, Conſecrate your ſelves to the Lord, &amp;c.]</q>
               <p>One reaſon is here given why the Levites did ſo readily undertake this dangerous ſervice, and ſo impartially execute Gods command upon thoſe that were tied to them by the neareſt bonds, to wit, becauſe Moſes had told them that hereby they ſhould ſo <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Though Moſes had already before ſo farre prevailed with the Lord by his prayers, that he would not preſently deſtroy all the people, as at firſt he threatned; and therefore it is ſaid v. 14. <hi>That the Lord repented of the evil which he thought to do unto his people;</hi> yet conſidering that the Lords anger might ſtill be great againſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and that he might ſtill proceed further in puniſhing thoſe that had ſinned againſt him, he reſolves yet further to intercede for them, with which he firſt acquaints the people, remembring them withall of the greatneſſe of their ſin, that ſo they might repent ſeriouſly of their ſinne, and thereby be made more capable of Gods favou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>the book of life,</hi> as Phil. 4. 3. and in many other places, it is a metaphoricall expreſſion, wherein the Scripture ſpeaks of God after the manner of men. Now when Moſes here ſaith that if God would not forgive the ſinnes of this people, he deſired that himſelf might be rather blotted out of the book of life, we cannot hence inferre that Gods decree can be changed, or that thoſe that are elected unto life may notwithſtanding periſh everlaſtingly, or that Gods juſtice will admit of the puniſhing of a righteous perſon together with the wicked: for in this ſpeech Moſes ſeeks onely to expreſſe, not what he thought might be, but what he could wiſh might be, if thereby the ſaving of Gods people might be procured: to wit, that out of his ſorrow for the rejection of this people, his zeal for Gods glory, and his great affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to his brethren, he could wiſh himſelf deprived of heavenly glory, that they might be again received into favour. This is all that Moſes intended in theſe words; onely being carried away with the ſtrength of his affections and vehemency of his deſires, he expreſſeth this by a way of requeſt, <hi>If not, blot me, I pray thee, out of the book which thou hast written.</hi> And thus generally is this ſpeech of Moſes underſtood. But yet it may alſo be underſtood of the catalogue and regiſter that is kept as it were in the divine omniſcience of all the living here in this world, out of which Moſes deſires to be blotted, that is, to be cut off by the hand of God rather then the people ſhould be caſt off, which he had ſo miraculouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly delivered out of their bondage in Egypt.

               <p>God here promiſeth Moſes that he would ſend an angel before them, but withall addes, that he would not go up himſelf in the midſt of them, as before he had promiſed. Some hold that the angel here meant is a created angel, not that angel of the covenant, of whom he had ſpoken before, chap. 23. 20. But ſeeing it is the ſame angel that had hitherto gone before them in the pillar of cloud by day, and in a pillar of fire by night, by whom God promiſeth that they ſhould be led on their way till they were poſſeſſed of the land of Canaan, I ſee not how we can underſtand it of a created angel, but that it muſt be meant of the Sonne of God, as before. However that which God here refuſeth to do for them, I conceive is the dwelling amongſt them in his tabernacle with thoſe ſignes of his gracious preſence, concerning which he had formerly given direction to Moſes: His angel he would ſend, as he had promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, to conduct them to Canaan, and to drive out the inhabitants before them; this he might do for any people, and this (becauſe he had promiſed it to Abraham) he would do for them; but to acknowledge them again for his people, and to teſtifie that by his dwelling in the midſt of them, to wit in his tabernacle, that he would not grant.</p>

               <p>Moſes, having now found the Lord ready to grant all his deſires, proceeds further, and makes one re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt more, to wit, that God would ſhew him his glory. Whereby I cannot think
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:103385:121"/>
that Moſes meant the very eſſence of God: for is it probable that Moſes was ſo farre ignorant of the nature and eſſence of God, that he did not know him to be a ſpirit infinite, and inviſible, every where preſent, but no where to be ſeen with bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily eyes, <hi>whom no man hath ſeen or can ſee,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſaith, 1. Tim. 6. 16? Surely no. Rather I think that Moſes conceiving that God when he ſpake to him had put on as it were ſome corporall and viſible ſhape, full of great majeſty and glory, and therefore overſhadowed with a cloud, he deſired to ſee the lightſome brightneſſe of Gods preſence, the cloud being taken away, and that doubtleſſe eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially (though happely not without ſome mixture of vain curioſity) that he might by this ſpeciall ſigne of Gods favour be confirmed concerning the gratious promiſe made to him and his people.</p>

               <p>That is, my ſelf, namely in a tranſitory viſion; my glory, ver. 22. or glorious goodneſſe: thus God yields to his requeſt, yet not every way as he had intended it; and in what manner he would do it he ſhews him afterwards, ver. 22, 23.</p>
               <q>And I will be gratious to whom I will be gratious, &amp;c.]</q>
               <p>If bold man ſhould dare to queſtion in his mind, why God ſhould pardon the foregoing ſinne of Iſrael, whileſt he puniſhes leſſe ſinnes in others, or why Moſes ſhould be honoured with ſuch a glorious viſion above all other men; his mouth is ſtopped with this which God ſaith of his freedome in communicating grace where he pleaſeth without wrong to any.</p>

                  <bibl>Verſ. 20.</bibl> Thou canſt not ſee my face; for there ſhall no man ſee me and live, &amp;c.]</q>
               <p>My face, that is, my eſſence, my being ſimply as I am in my ſelf (and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it is moſt true in that ſenſe that no man can ſee Gods face. Even where Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and Chriſt are compared together by the Evangeliſt S. John, this ſeeing of God is made the peculiar prerogative of Chriſt the ſonne God, John 1. 17, 18.) Or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by <hi>the face of God</hi> here is meant the majeſty and glory attending that externall ſhape which God had now aſſumed, which Moſes could not behold, and therefore it was covered with a cloud; and this the Lord gives as a reaſon why God denied this part of his requeſt, becauſe he had deſired that which being granted him would have been his ruine, mans weakneſſe being ſuch that he is not able to behold ſuch a glorious brightneſſe as this was, and as is that <hi>light inacceſſible, which no man can approch unto, wherein God dwels,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, 1. Tim. 6. 16. And indeed, if by <hi>the face of God</hi> here were meant Gods eſſence, <hi>thou canſt not ſee my face,</hi> that is, my eſſence, thou canſt not ſee me as I am in my ſelf, then by that following rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, <hi>for there ſhall no man ſee me and live,</hi> we might inferre that it is poſſible for men to ſee the eſſence of God though not without perill to their lives: which is not ſo; for God is in his eſſence altogether inviſible. Jacob ſaw God face to face, Gen. 32. 30. but it was in that ſhape wherein God was pleaſed to repreſent himſelf, and if Moſes ſaw more then Jacob, yet he ſaw onely ſome more glorious repreſentation of the deity, not the divine eſſence it ſelf.</p>

going and paſſing away, and that onely for a ſhort time; but withall this rock might ſignifie Chriſt, by whom we attain the true knowledge of God; and looking thorow a clift might ſignifie the ſmall meaſure of knowledge of God we have in this life comparatively.</p>

               <p>It is moſt probable that God paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by in an humane viſible ſhape, but in ſuch brightneſſe and glory as was never ſhown to mortall creature; ſo that theſe paſſages both of Gods hand and back-parts muſt be underſtood literally. But by this repreſentation of the back-parts and not the face to be ſeen by Moſes, the Lord intended to teach him, that as vve knovv men very imperfectly vvhen vve ſee onely their back-parts, even ſo is the knovvledge vvhich the beſt can have of God in this life little and imperfect.</p>

               <p>No ſuch thing befell him before<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when he was the firſt time upon the mount with the Lord fourty dayes and fourty nights, becauſe then the Lord had not ſhown him his glory in ſo great a degree as now he had.

Now for the ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of Moſes face, it was doubtleſſe to ſignifie the glory of the law which he preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to them, whence is that of the Apoſtle, 2.

               <p>Moſes came down with vengeance before, and what might they think of this glory put upon him now, being ſtill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious to themſelves of the haynouſneſſe of their former rebellion?

And the direction that is here firſt given concerning theſe is, that if a burnt-offering were to be offered of the herd, it muſt be a male without blemiſh, that it might be the fitter to figure forth Chriſts perfection in himſelf, and ours in him, who being perfectly holy, and free from the leaſt blemiſh of ſinne, <hi>He did no ſinne: neither was guile found in his mouth,</hi> 1.

               <p>That is, he that will offer a burnt ſacrifice, he muſt do it voluntarily of his own mind, and not be forced to it; and when he brings it he muſt preſent it to the prieſt <hi>at the doore of the tabernacle of the congregation;</hi> that is, at the doore of the court, cloſe within which the braſen altar for burnt-offerings ſtood. The firſt of theſe might ſignifie the freedome of Gods grace in giving his ſonne, and the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingneſſe of Chriſt in giving himſelf to be a ſacrifice of propitiation for our ſouls; but principally doubtleſſe it was to teach them, that in all ſervice done to God, it muſt be done freely and willingly, or God will not accept of it: The ſecond was appointed to ſignifie that their ſacrifices (and ſo conſequently any ſervice that we perform) were onely in and through Chriſt ſanctified and made acceptable to God: The tabernacle was a type of Chriſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               <p>This was to teſtifie, Firſt, that he acknowledged himſelf guilty of death: Secondly, that he deſired and believed that that ſacrifice ſhould be accepted of God as a ranſome for his ſoul, that all his ſinnes ſhould be laid upon it, and ſo it ſhould ſuffer death as it were in his ſtead; in all which notwithſtanding they that did this had not reſpect ſo much to the beaſt ſlain, in the death whereof there could not be an equall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation given to the juſtice of God for the death of ſinners, as to Chriſt, of whom theſe ſacrifices were types, who took upon him our ſinnes, and the curſe due to our ſinnes, when he died for us: Thirdly, that he deſired, and would indeavour to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrate himſelf wholly to Gods ſervice, as now he gave this ſacrifice wholly to be offered upon the altar to the Lord, crucifying all his ſinnefull luſts and affections, and yielding up his whole man to the obedience of Gods will in all things what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever.</p>

               <p>That is, the prieſt in the name of the offerer: for this was uſually the work of the prieſts, and therefore Moſes did it when he ſupplyed the prieſts office, Exod. 29. 10, 11. though ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the Levites alſo helped herein when there were not prieſts enough to do it, 2. Chron. 25. 10, 11. <hi>The prieſts ſtood in their places, and the Levites in their courſes, and they killed the Paſſeover</hi> (that is, the Paſſeover-offerings) <hi>and the prieſts ſprinkled the bloud from their hands,</hi> as being given of God to be aſſiſtant to the prieſts in ſuch ſervices, Numb. 8. 19. <hi>I have given the Levites as a gift to Aa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron and to his ſonnes, to do the ſervice of the children of Iſrael in the tabernacle of the congregation, and to make an atonement for the children of Iſrael.</hi> Now the ſacrifice was killed to ſignifie the death of Chriſt, <hi>Who was ſlain that he might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem us to God by his bloud,</hi> Revel. 5. 9. and the mortifying of Gods people by the word and ſpirit: and it was killed by the prieſt, to ſignifie that Chriſt ſhould offer up himſelf unto God, as being both our prieſt and ſacrifice, and that there is no poſſibility for men to pleaſe God by any ſervice they do him, but onely in and through the mediation of Chriſt, of whoſe prieſthood the Leviticall prieſt was a type and figure. As for the place where it was killed, that may be gathered, by the rule of Analogy, from that which is expreſſed verſe the 11. concerning the ſecond ſort of burnt-offerings, namely, that it was killed at the north-ſide of the altar.</p>
               <q>And the prieſts Aarons ſonnes ſhall bring the bloud, and sprinkle the bloud, &amp;c.]</q>
               <p>And this was done in a large meaſure, ſo that <hi>the corners of the altar were filled with bloud,</hi> Zach. 9. 15. to teach the people that this bloud of their ſacrifice ſhould not be loſt as ſpilt upon the ground, but ſhould be accepted of God as a propitiation for their ſinnes, as being a figure of the bloud of Chriſt, which ſhould be offered up to God and accepted by him in our behalf, as for our reconciliation, ſo alſo for our ſanctification, <hi>who are elect according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, through ſanctification of the ſpirit unto obedience, and ſprinkling of the bloud of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt,</hi> 1.

               <q>
                  <bibl>Verſ. 6.</bibl> And he ſhall flay the burnt-offering.]</q>
               <p>That is, the prieſt: for the flay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the ſacrifice was alſo ordinarily the work of the prieſt, who had therefore the skinne for himſelf, Levit. 7. 8. though upon extraordinary occaſions (as is before noted concerning killing the burnt-offerings) even in this alſo the Levites ſometime helped them, 2. Chron. 29. 34. <hi>The prieſts were too few, ſo that they could not flay all the burnt-offerings; wherefore their brethren the Levites did help them.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the ſacrifices were offered (as I may ſay) as a holy feaſt unto the Lord, whence the altar is called <hi>the table of the Lord,</hi> and the ſacrifice offered thereon, <hi>his meat,</hi> Mal. 1. 12. therefore nothing but what was uſually eaten by men was burnt upon the altar; and hence it was that the skinne was alwayes flayed off. Yet withall it is commonly held by Expoſitours that this flaying of the ſacrifice did alſo ſignifie,
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:103385:125"/>
Firſt, the ſufferings of Chriſt, who being firſt ſtripped of his garments, Matth. 27. 28<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they did afterwards moſt ſhamefully intreat, ſo that there was no beauty in him why men ſhould deſire him: Secondly, the afflictions of Gods people under the rage of cruell oppreſſours and perſecutours, <hi>Who,</hi> as the Prophet ſpeaks, Micha. 3. 3. <hi>eat their fleſh, and flay their skinne from off them:</hi> And thirdly, the mortification which God requires in thoſe that give up their names to him, even that <hi>They put off concerning the former converſation the old man, which is corrupt according to the deceitfull luſts,</hi> Epheſ. 5. 22.</p>

               <p>Here the Lord gives direction for the burning of theſe ſacrifices by the inſeriour prieſts, enjoyning them, firſt, to <hi>put fire upon the altar.</hi> Now becauſe they were to uſe no ſtrange fire in burning the ſacrifices, but onely that fire which was conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually nouriſhed upon the altar, Levit. 6. 12, 13. and which at firſt came down from heaven, Levit. 9. 24. therefore by <hi>putting fire upon the altar,</hi> is meant onely the laying of the fire together, or laying it on again when they had laid it by for the clearing of the altar: Secondly, to lay the wood in order, and then all the pieces of the ſacrifices in order upon the wood; which was ſo appointed, becauſe the diſcreet laying of the wood doth much conduce to the well burning of the fire: And then laſtly, thus to burn all upon the altar. The miſtery of this might be twofold: Firſt, to ſignifie the conſecrating of Chriſt and his members by afflictions and ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings; for as he <hi>the Captain of our ſalvation was made perfect by ſufferings,</hi> Heb. 2. 10. ſo muſt his members alſo be ready alwayes through theſe fiery trials to enter into glory, <hi>for every one ſhall be ſalted with fire, and every ſacrifice ſhall be ſalted with ſalt,</hi> Mark 9. 49. Secondly, to ſignifie that holy zeal whereby we ſhould wholly give up our ſelves to God through the operation of Gods holy ſpirit, which is often in the Scriptures compared to fire, as Matth. 3. 11. <hi>He that cometh after me is mightier then I, he ſhall baptize you with the holy Ghoſt and with fire:</hi> for as Chriſt <hi>through the eternall ſpirit offered himſelf without ſpot unto God,</hi> Heb. 9. 14. ſo likewiſe it is the ſpirit whereby we muſt be enabled to conſecrate our ſelves to Gods ſervice, <hi>Ye have purified your ſouls in obeying the truth</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle Peter) <hi>through the spirit,</hi> 1. Pet. 1. 22. to which end we muſt not onely be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full <hi>not to quench the ſpirit,</hi> 1. Theſſ. 5. 19. but alſo by prayer, holy meditation, and all other things conducing thereto, we muſt do what we can to further this work of the ſpirit in us, as they did in burning the ſacrifices, by laying in order the wood and the pieces of the ſacrifice upon the wood.</p>

               <p>The manner how the prieſts ſhould kill the burnt-offering of turtle doves, or young pigeons, is here ſet down<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which was by wringing off the head of them (according to our tranſlati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) or pinching of the head with the prieſts nail, as it is in the margin of our bibles. The moſt common opinion of Expoſitours is, that the heads of theſe birds were not quite wrung off from their bodies, but onely broken in ſunder, and ſo left hanging ſtill by the skinne unto their bodies: and their chief reaſon is, becauſe elſewhere it is ſaid, where direction is given for the killing of ſuch turtle doves, or young pige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that were brought for a ſinne-offering, that the prieſts ſhould <hi>wring off his head from his neck, but not divide it aſunder,</hi> Levit. 5. 8. But ſome other reaſons may make it ſeem more probable that the heads of theſe birds that were brought for a burnt-offering were quite wrung off from their bodies: as Firſt, becauſe we cannot vvell elſe conceive hovv the bloud of theſe ſacrifices ſhould be <hi>wrung out at the ſide of the altar,</hi> as it is injoyned in the follovving vvords; and vve knovv that the Jevvs did of all things abhorre things that vvere ſtrangled, and that the effuſion of the bloud of the ſacrifices vvas the chief thing vvhereby vvas ſignified the atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:103385:126"/>
made for us by the bloud of Chriſt, and how by the pinching of the prieſts nail a wound ſhould be made for the letting out the bloud as ſome hold, it is hard to conceive: and ſecondly, becauſe the following words, <hi>and burn it on the altar,</hi> ſeem plainly to be meant of burning the head particularly, being thus wrung off; for of the burning of the body of theſe birds, direction is afterwards given, verſ. 17.

               <p>Peace-offerings were either to obtain from God ſome bleſſing which they wanted, or by way of gratulation or thankſgiving for ſome bleſſing received. The chief and moſt ordinary uſe of them was doubtleſſe in a way of thankſgiving for their peace and proſperity, the ſeverall ſorts whereof are ſet down in the ſeaventh chapter. But yet ſometimes they were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo uſed when men in their troubles prayed unto God for peace and ſalvation: ſo Judges 20. 26. when the Iſraelites faſted and ſought unto the Lord for his aid and favour, becauſe the men of Benjamin had twice beaten them in battel, <hi>they offered burnt-offerings and peace-offerings before the Lord;</hi> and when David ſought to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſe Gods anger, when the peſtilence raged in the land becauſe of his numbering the people, <hi>He built an altar to the Lord, and offered burnt-offerings and peace-of-ferings,</hi> 1. Chron. 21. 26. the Lord hereby teaching us that with ſupplications for what we want we muſt alſo joyn thankſgiving for what we already injoy. So then the peace-offerings ſignified 1. Chriſts oblation of himſelf, whereby he became our peace, Epheſ. 2. 14. and 2. the ſacrifice of praiſe which in and through him we offer unto God. The ſacrifices appointed here for the peace-offerings are a male or female of the herd or of the flock: turtle doves and young pigeons are not here allowed for the poorer ſort, as in burnt-offerings they were, and that becauſe the peace-offerings were to be divided into three parts; one for the altar, another for the prieſt, and a third for the offerer, and ſuch a diviſion could not be conveniently made in ſo ſmall ſacrifices. But yet becauſe this ſacrifice was by way of thankfulneſſe for temporall bleſſings externall, peace and proſperity, therefore <hi>a female,</hi> a leſſe perfect ſacrifice was here accepted of God.

               <p>Why this ſacrifice was to be killed by the prieſts, and the bloud to be ſprinkled upon the altar, you may ſee by that which is ſaid before upon chapter 1. verſ. 5. That which
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:103385:128" rendition="simple:additions"/>
is particularly obſervable here is, that theſe ſacrifices of peace-offerings were not kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led at the ſame place where the oth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

But now the peace-offerings were to be killed in another place, to wit, <hi>at the doore of the tabernacle of the congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> that is, the very entrance of the court, where ſtood the braſen altar, which was more Eaſtward then the place where the other ſacrifices were killed. And the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of this we may well conceive was, 1. Becauſe the fat and the breaſt of theſe peace-offerings were to be waved before the altar in the hands of the offerer, who might not go into the court, but ſtand at the doore, chap. 7. 30. and 2. Becauſe theſe peace-offerings, whereof the offerer did eat a part, were not reckoned amongſt the moſt holy things, which were onely eaten by the prieſt. And hence this is given as a reaſon why the treſpaſſe-offering was to be killed in the ſame place where the burnt-offerings were killed, becauſe it was moſt holy, and to be eaten by the prieſts onely, chap. 14. 13.</p>

in them a reverend remembrance of theſe holy rites, and the ſpirituall myſteries ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified thereby.

As for the perſon that was to carry forth this bullock for a ſinne-oſfering without the camp, and to burn him there, though the words in the 12. verſ. may ſeem to have reference to the prieſt that offered the ſinne-offering, <hi>The whole bullock ſhall he carry forth without the camp,</hi> &amp;c. yet the meaning onely is that he ſhould ſee it were done, not that he ſhould do it himſelf, and ſo become unclean thereby, as may appear by what is ſaid in another place that is parallel vvith this, chap. 16. 27, 28.</p>

               <p>In this chapter ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances are given of ſinnes committed by private perſons, for which they were to bring a ſinne-offering to the Lord; and that eſpecially as I conceive, to ſhew in what caſes the offerings which they brought for their ſinnes were to be of that ſort which were more particularly called and eſteemed <hi>trespaſſe-offerings:</hi> for of ſuch it is evident that Moſes ſpeaks, at leaſt principally in this chapter. Much arguing there is amongſt Expoſitours to ſhew the difference between ſinne-offerings and treſpaſſe-offerings: ſome hold that the ſinne-offerings mentioned in the former chapter were for ſins of commiſſion, the treſpaſſe-offerings ſpoken of in this chapter were for ſinnes of omiſſion: ſome again hold that the ſinne-offerings were for grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter tranſgreſſions, and others quite contrary, that the treſpaſſe-offerings were for greater tranſgreſſions, and the ſinne-offerings for ſmaller offences.

Herein onely I conceive the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference lay, that for ſome particular ſinnes a ſinne-offering was appointed, different from the ordinary ſinne-offerings injoyned particular perſons in the former chapter, which becauſe it was for ſuch ſinnes wherein ſome treſpaſſe was committed upon the goods of their neighbour, or upon the holy things of the Lord, which belonged un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the prieſts, therefore they were more particularly called <hi>trespaſſe-offerings.</hi> The firſt particular inſtance given in the firſt verſe of the chapter is concerning him that ſinneth in concealing his knowledge, when he might have witneſſed the truth, <hi>If a ſoul ſinne</hi> (ſaith the text) <hi>and heare the voyce of ſwearing, and is a witneſſe,</hi> &amp;c. for the meaning of this place, ſo diverſely expounded, I con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

               <p>How the fat of the peace-offerings was to be burnt upon the altar, was ſhown before, chap. 3. 3, 4, 5. Here now is preſcribed how the remainder of the ſacrifice was to be eaten. And for the underſtanding hereof, we muſt note that there are here three ſeverall ſorts of peace-offerings mentioned, or three ſeverall occaſions of offering peace-offerings: the firſt were theſe that were offered <hi>for thankſgiving,</hi> verſ. 15. that is, by way of teſtifying their thankfulneſſe for ſome mercies received: the ſecond were thoſe that were offered in liew of a vow, and this the moſt Expoſitours conceive to be meant of ſuch peace-offerings which men vowed they would give unto God if ſuch or ſuch a mercie God ſhould grant them, and which accordingly when God had ſatisfied their deſires they did then pay unto God; which though paid by way of thankſgiving they make to be different from the former, becauſe thoſe were brought onely upon the generall bond of thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and that for generall mercies, theſe were brought upon a ſpeciall bond of a vow made upon their obtaining ſome ſpeciall bleſſing, which they had deſired of God. But others again underſtand it of peace-offerings vowed and paid according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the vow not being conditionall in caſe any ſuch bleſſing were obtained but ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute; and ſo they make this to differ from the firſt which was for thankſgiving: yea and ſome underſtand it of ſuch peace-offerings as were offered not in perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of a vow formerly made, but at the time when a vow was made by way of ſeeking Gods favour for the obtaining of ſome bleſſing which they ſought of God. The third were thoſe that were brought as a voluntary offering, which were ſuch as were not brought upon any particular obligation either of mercies received, or of the want of any bleſſing, but of devotion in generall, by way of acknowledging Gods goodneſſe to them in generall, and teſtifying their deſire of the continuance of his

                  </gap>in, 2. we muſt note, that for the firſt of theſe one law is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and for the other two, another: for thoſe peace-offerings that were for thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving, they were commanded to eat the ſame day they were offered, both the prieſt and the people; but thoſe that were for a vow or voluntary offering, they had two dayes allowed them for the eating of them, and then what was left on the third day was to be burnt with fire. And why was this difference? Surely becauſe God would hereby teach them that he muſt be worſhipped as himſelf appointeth, and not as they in their reaſon ſhould think <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>it; and withall the appointing of that to be preſently eaten which was for thankſgiving might teach them not to be remiſſe in returning thanks for the bleſſings they injoyed.</p>

               <p>The fleſh of the peace-offerings was not to be eaten doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe in the holy place, but was carried thence (after it was killed at the tabernacle and the fat burnt upon the altar) and eaten elſe-where: for ſo it is ſaid of the right ſhoulder and breaſt which were the prieſts portion, Levit. 10. 14. <hi>The wave-breaſt and the heave-ſhoulder ſhall ye eat in a clean place, thou and thy ſonnes and thy daughters with thee.</hi> And well we may conclude that if the prieſts did not eat their portion in the holy place, much leſſe did the people eat their portion there.

And hereby alſo vvas ſhaddovved forth that thoſe that bear the name of Chriſt, and profeſſe themſelves Chriſtians, and yet continue in their ſinnes, and hate to be reformed, deſtruction ſhall be their end, neither vvill God reckon them amongſt his people; and more particularly vvhoever partake of the ſignes and ſeals of grace unvvorthily do eat and drink judgement to themſelves, 1.

                  <bibl>Verſ. 1.</bibl> ANd it came to paſſe on the eighth day that Moſes called Aaron and his ſonnes, &amp;c.]</q>
               <p>That is, on the very next day after the ſeven dayes of the prieſts conſecration were ended, whereof mention was made in the 33. verſe of the foregoing chapter, as is evident alſo by that which the Prophet Ezeklel ſaith in his alluſion to this, Ezek. 43. 26, 27. <hi>Seven dayes ſhall they purge the altar, and conſecrate themſelves, and when theſe dayes are expired, it ſhall be that upon the eighth day and ſo forward the priests ſhall make your burnt-offerings upon the altar,</hi> &amp;c. What day of the moneth this was done, is not expreſſed. Evident it is that the tabernacle was erected on the firſt day of the firſt moneth in the ſecond year after their coming out of Egypt, Exod. 40. 17. and immediately the Lord ſpake unto Moſes out of the tabernacle and gave him the ſeverall Laws concerning the ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices ſet down in the firſt chapter of this Book, as is noted, Lev. 1. 1. After this Moſes performed all that was injoyned him for the conſecrating of Aaron and his ſonnes, and for the anointing and ſanctifying of the tabernacle and all that was therein, wherein ſeven dayes were ſpent, and then the next day after Aaron and his ſonnes entred upon the executing of the prieſts office, as is here related. Indeed ſome hold that the ſeven dayes of the conſecration of Aaron and his ſonnes were before the firſt day of the firſt moneth when the tabernacle was reared up by Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and that becauſe the Princes offered on that very day when the altar was anoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Moſes, Numb. 7. 1, 10. (which they conceive was done at the ſame time when the tabernacle was erected) and the prieſts could not have offered the Princes ſacrifices if they had not been before that time conſecrated and ſettled in their prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood. But this opinion is grounded upon a double miſtake, to wit, that the altar was anointed by Moſes the ſame day the tabernacle was erected, and that the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces ſacrifices were offered on the ſame day whereon the altar was anointed, which indeed cannot be truly inferred from that forecited place in the 7. of Numbers, as ſhall be ſhown in the notes there. All that can be ſaid concerning the day when Aaron and his ſonnes entred upon the execution of their prieſthood is, that it was the very next day after the ſeven dayes of their conſecration were ended.</p>

                  <bibl>Verſ. 2.</bibl> And he ſaid unto Aaron, Take thee a young calf for a ſinne-offering.]</q>
               <p>Before Aaron might be ſuffered to offer up any ſacrifice, he is commanded by Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to offer up a young calf as a ſinne-offering for himſelf: And hence the Apoſtle proves the weakneſſe and inſufficiency of the Leviticall prieſthood, to wit, that
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:103385:136"/>
thoſe prieſts were not fit in themſelves to ſtand as Mediatours betwixt God and the people, being ſinners themſelves, but were types and ſhadows of another to come, to wit, Chriſt, who was holy, harmleſſe, undefiled and ſeparate from ſinners, &amp;c. Heb. 7. 26, 27. But ſince a young bullock is appointed for the high prieſts ſinne-offering. Levit. 4. 3. Why is Aaron here commanded to offer a young calf for a ſinne-offering? I anſwer, between a young calf and a young bullock there was no great difference (the one happely was, as the Hebrews ſay, of the firſt year, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the ſecond) but yet of that difference the reaſon we may conceive to be this, becauſe in the fourth chapter a ſinne-offering is appointed onely by way of atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for ſome particular ſinne of ignorance committed by the high prieſt; but this ſinne-offering here injoyned was for the ſinnes of the prieſts in generall, and that alſo in a particular caſe, for their firſt entrance upon the execution of their office, and therefore here not a young bullock, as there was injoyned<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but a young calf was offered for their ſinne-offering, and that by the Lords ſpeciall direction.</p>

               <p>That is, this was not the burnt-offering and meat-offering which was every morning to be offered, as God appointed Exod. 24. 38, 39, 40. but an extraordinary offering beſides, which by ſpeciall direction was offered at this time.</p>

                  <hi>This was a kind of applying the ſacrifice to them, and to make known that God did gratiouſly accept of thoſe ſacrifices from them; and it was done according to the manner ſet down, Numb. 6. 23,</hi> &amp;c.

Sam. 15. 30. <hi>David went up the aſcent of mount Olivet, and wept as he went up, and had his head covered, and he went barefoot, and all the people that was with him covered every man his head, and they went up weeping as they went up:</hi> and ſo again, chap. 19. 4. <hi>But the king covered his face, and the king cried with a loud voyce, Oh my ſonne Abſolom, O Abſolom my ſonne, my ſonne:</hi> See alſo Jer. 14. 3, 4.

The chief aim of this command was to intimate why they might not go out as mourners to the buriall of their brethren, to wit, becauſe they might not put off their prieſtly attire, and ſo give over the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice they had in hand, the rather becauſe they were newly conſecrated, and there were ſo few of them to attend the ſervice.</p>

               <p>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt other things wherein Moſes feared leſt Aaron and his ſonnes ſhould offend by reaſon of the ſorrow which God had brought upon them, this was one thing, he doubted leſt they ſhould omit the eating of the ſinne-offering, and therefore he ſought diligently to ſee what was done with it, to wit, that goat of the ſin-offering ſpoken of Levit. 9. 15. <hi>And he tooke the goat which was the ſinne-offering,</hi> &amp;c. as appeareth verſ. 10. of this chapter, where Moſes ſaith <hi>it was given them to bear the iniquitie of the congregation.</hi> Indeed it is clear that the ſinne-offering for the congregation was to be carried without the camp, and burnt by that law, Levit. 4. 21. <hi>And he ſhall carry forth the bullock without the camp, and burn him as he burned the firſt bullock.</hi> But then the bloud of that ſinne-offering was carried within the tabernacle, Levit 4. 16, 17. Now becauſe Aaron had not yet acceſſe into the holy place, till he had prepared a way by theſe firſt ſacrifices in the court, therefore the bloud of this ſinne-offering was not brought into the tabernacle as in an extraordinary caſe, and conſequently it was not to be burnt without the camp, but to be eaten by the prieſts, by that other law, Levit. 6. 26, 30. <hi>The prieſt that offereth it for ſinne ſhall eat it, in the holy place ſhall it be eaten, in the court of the tabernacle of the congregation,</hi> &amp;c. This Aaron and his ſonnes in their grief either forgetting or not duly conſidering did burn it without the camp, which was not according to the law. See the note upon Levit. 9. 15.</p>

               <p>This apology of Aarons conſiſts of three parts: 1. That though they had failed in this particular, yet the main had not been neglected, the ſacrifices had been duly offered: 2. That their failing in the rites and ceremonies requiſite was by reaſon of grief, occaſioned by thoſe dolefull accidents which had ſo lately befallen them: 3. That this might now extenuate his fault (though happely he did not omit it upon that reaſon) that if they had eaten the ſinne-offering it would not have been acceptable to the Lord; becauſe of that heavineſſe and ſorrow that was upon them, which made them unfit and unworthy to eat thoſe holy things, for the law requires them that eat before the Lord to rejoyce.

               <p>The former laws concerned the ſanctification of the prieſts, and the rites and ceremonies of the ſacrifices, now generall laws are given concerning the ſanctification of the people, and firſt for avoyding that uncleanneſſe which co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth from things without the man: and in giving theſe laws the Lord ſpake both to Moſes and to Aaron, becauſe it belonged both to the magiſtrate and prieſt to ſee theſe laws executed, the prieſt being to teach the difference between clean and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean, Ezek. 44. 23. <hi>And they ſhall teach my people the difference between the holy and profane, and cauſe men to diſcern between the unclean and clean,</hi> and the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate to take care that this difference was obſerved: and hence is that, Numb. 9. 6. <hi>And there were certain men who were defiled by the dead body of a man, that they could not keep the paſſeover on that day, and they came before Moſes,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

               <p>Why theſe are allowed as clean, others forbidden as unclean, I think no ſound reaſon can be given, but Gods good will and pleaſure, and his power to give what laws he pleaſeth unto his people. The moſt probable myſticall reaſons given are theſe: Firſt, that the parting of the hoof in twain ſignified the right diſcerning of the word and will of God when we are able to judge of it, not carually but ſpiritually, 1. Cor. 2. 14, 15. <hi>But the carnall man receiveth not the things of the ſpirit, for they are fooliſhneſſe unto him, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can he know them, becauſe they are ſpiritually diſcerned: But he that is ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall indgeth all things,</hi> &amp;c. Secondly, that the chewing of the cud ſignified the ſerious meditation of the law of God day and night, Pſal. 1. 2. <hi>But his delight is in the law of the Lord, and in his law doth he meditate day and night.</hi> For that is the food of our ſouls, Amos 8. 11. <hi>Behold the day is come, ſaith the Lord God, that I will ſend a famine in the land, not a famine of bread, nor a thirst of water, but of hearing the words of the Lord.</hi> And therefore having received this our food, we ſhould repeat and recall it to mind, Mal. 4. 3. <hi>Remember ye the law, of Moſes my ſervant, which I commanded unto him in Horeb for all Iſra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Becauſe in ſuch ſtrength of nature in the party expelling the inward corruption all over his body, it proves not the infectious leproſie, which makes the fleſh raw, but is indeed a kind of ſcurf or ſcab, though termed here a leproſie, becauſe it was ordinarily ſo eſteemed by the people.</p>

                  <bibl>Verſ. 2.</bibl> THis ſhall be the law of the leper in the day of his cleanſing, &amp;c.]</q>
               <p>The ſolemn rites for cleanſing the leper were for two ends ſo ordained of God: 1. To ſhew how the Lord abhorred the ſpirituall uncleanneſſe of ſinne, ſince the leper might not after his pollution be received again into the camp, though healed, without a ſacrifice of reconciliation were firſt offered up for him: 2. That the leper might teſtifie his thankfulneſſe to God who had removed ſo heavie a judgement from him; whence is that of Chriſt to the leper he healed, Matth. 8. 4. <hi>And Jeſus ſaid unto him, See thou tell no man, but go thy way, ſhew thy ſelf to the prieſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and offer the gift that Moſes commanded for a teſtimony to them.</hi>

               <q>
                  <bibl>Verſ. 3.</bibl> And behold, if the plague of the leproſie be healed in the leper.]</q>
               <p>When God had healed the leproſie, then the prieſt was to pronounce him clean: and ſo it is God onely that forgives ſinnes; the miniſter is onely to pronounce according to that which God hath done, nor can abſolve any whom God hath not abſolved.</p>
               <q>
                  <bibl>Verſ. 4.</bibl> Then ſhall theprieſt command to take, &amp;c. two birds alive, and, clean, &amp; cedar-wood, and ſcarlet, and hyſop.]</q>
               <p>The birds muſt be clean birds, to wit, either doves or turtles commonly uſed in ſacrifices, or ſparrows (as ſome tranſlate the word here) or any other clean fowls, ſuch as all are ſave thoſe excepted Levit. 11. 13. &amp;c. Onely they muſt not be of a tame kind<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but ſuch as uſed to fly in the open field, verſ. 7. The cedar which the prieſt here was injoyned to take, was a cedar-ſtick, which was to be a handle for the ſprinkle: and it was to be of cedar-wood (as moſt conceive) becauſe the nature of this wood is, that it corrupts not, but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerveth other things from putrefaction; and ſo hereby was ſignified the perfect hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the leproſie, which before corrupted and putrified the body. Yet I rather think there was a reſpect had (as in the ſcarlet) to the reddiſh colour of it, which made it the more ſuitable for this work, the chief drift whereof was to ſignifie the cleanſing of the ſinner by the bloud of Chriſt: The ſcarlet was a ſcarlet thred or lace, uſed to bind the ſprinkle to the cedar-ſtick: And the hyſop was appointed for the ſprinkle, being fit for that uſe; and withall the fragrant ſmell of this herb might ſignifie that the evil ſavour of the leproſie was gone away.</p>
               <q>
                  <bibl>Verſ. 5.</bibl> And the prieſt ſhall command that one of the birds be killed in an ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then veſſell over running water.]</q>
               <p>That is, over an earthen veſſell that hath running water in it. And as the bloud of the killed bird ſignified the bloud of Chriſt, ſo the earthen veſſell the baſeneſſe and infirmity of the miniſters, by whom this bloud is preſented unto men in the preaching of the Goſpel, 2. Cor. 4. 7. <hi>But we have this treaſure in earthen veſſels, that the excellency of the power might be of God, and not of us.</hi> Now becauſe the bloud of the bird of it ſelf would not have ſufficed to dip the living bird and the ſprinkle in, therefore it was mixed with water; but it muſt be the pureſt and moſt cleanſing water, <hi>running water,</hi> that is, ſpring water, becauſe it ſignified the cleanſing of the ſinner by Chriſts bloud, who <hi>came not by water onely, but by water and bloud,</hi> 1. Joh. 5. 6.</p>
               <q>
                  <bibl>Verſ. 7.</bibl> And he ſhall ſprinkle upon him that is to be cleanſed, &amp;c.]</q>
               <p>The ſprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of this bloud ſignified the applying of Chriſts bloud to the cleanſing of the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:103385:143"/>
which is therefore called <hi>the bloud of ſprinkling that ſpeaketh better things then that of Abel,</hi> Hebr. 12. 24. Why it was done ſeven times, ſee the note upon Levit. 4. 6.</p>
               <q>And ſhall let the living bird looſe into the open field.]</q>
               <p>The letting of the living bird looſe figured the deliverance of Chriſt from death, <hi>Who though he was cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied through weakneſſe, yet he liveth by the power of God,</hi> 2. Cor. 13. 4. <hi>being put to death in the fleſh, but quickned in the ſpirit,</hi> 1. Pet. 3. 18. and of all ſuch as are cleanſed from their ſinnes by his bloud: and therefore particularly it repreſented the condition of the leper now cleanſed, who being civilly dead and buried, was now as the bird let looſe to live amongſt his fellows, and reſtored again to the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of Saints. And why was this? by virtue of the bloud of Chriſt, wherein fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guratively he was dipped.</p>
               <q>
                  <bibl>Verſ. 8.</bibl> And he that is to be cleanſed ſhall waſh his clothes, &amp;c.]</q>
               <p>That no part of the filth iſſuing from his leproſie might remain upon him he was to waſh both his garments and his fleſh; and becauſe waſhing could not ſufficiently cleanſe the hair of his body, therefore all the hair of his body muſt be clean ſhaved off: and this was done the firſt day of his cleanſing; which ſignified how exactly every one that hath hope of being cleanſed by Chriſt muſt labour to purifie himſelf even as he is pure, 1, John 3. 3.</p>
               <q>And after that he ſhall come into the camp, and ſhall tarry abroad out of his tent ſeven dayes.]</q>
               <p>That is, after he hath the firſt time waſhed himſelf and ſhaved off his hair, he ſhall be admitted into the camp, town or citie, but yet he ſhall not go into his tent or dwelling-houſe, but ſhall tarry abroad, to wit, in ſome place or houſe appointed for that purpoſe, where he was to continue for ſeven dayes apart by himſelf; which was, I conceive, becauſe as yet he was not perfectly cleanſed, and therefore was not familiarly to converſe with others as formerly, no not with them of his own family.</p>
               <q>
                  <bibl>Verſ. 9.</bibl> And it ſhall be on the ſeventh day, that he ſhall ſhave all the hair off his head.]</q>
               <p>The reiteration of theſe ceremonies the ſecond time on the ſeventh day may imply how exactly carefull we ſhould be to cleanſe our ſelves from all filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of ſinne, and withall how hardly we are brought either to hate ſinne, or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge Gods mercy as we ſhould do.</p>

               <p>The two he-lambs were the one for a treſpaſſe-offering, verſe 12. the other for a burnt-offering, as is evident, verſe 19, 20. See alſo Levit. 1. 10. The ew-lamb was for a ſinne-offering, Levit. 4. 32.</p>
               <q>And three tenth deals of fine flowre for a meat-offering mingled with oyl, and one log of oyl.]</q>
               <p>Theſe three tenth deals were three homers or pottles, three tenth parts of an ephah or buſhell, as is before noted upon Exod. 29. 40. and the log of oyl is commonly thought to be half a pint: the three tenth deals of fine flowre were for acceſſory meat-offerings for the three ſacrifices afore mentioned. Indeed in the fifteenth of Numbers meat-offerings are appointed onely for burnt-offerings and peace-offerings, nor do we any where reade of a meat-offering that was to be joyned either with ſinne-offering or treſpaſſe-offering. And beſides, where an
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:103385:144"/>
offering of fine flowre is injoyned for a ſinne-offering, Levit. 5. 11. to wit, to be offered apart by it ſelf, not as acceſſory to any other ſacrifice, they were forbidden to put any oyl upon it, whereas theſe are appointed to be mingled with oyl: And therefore it ſeems theſe ſacrifices for the cleanſing of the leper had peculiar rites, and were not in all things performed according to the ordinary way of other ſacrifices.</p>

The conceit of the Papiſts, That God appeared there in an humane ſhape upon the mercie-ſeat, hath no ground for it in the text: Nor do we any where reade that God did ever ſo appear in the tabernacle either to the high prieſt or to Moſes himſelf.

<pb n="279" facs="tcp:103385:145" rendition="simple:additions"/>
which the high prieſt wore under his other rich attire, and that together with theſe here mentioned all his other garments are to be underſtood alſo. But becauſe it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly ſaid, verſ. 23. that when Aaron returned out of the moſt holy place into the tabernacle of the congregation, he ſhould put off the linen garments, which he put on when he went into the holy place, and ſhould leave them there; therefore I ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther conceive with others that theſe were other plain linen garments, like thoſe that were made for the inferiour prieſts, Exod. 39. 27, 28. And that the high prieſt did wear theſe onely when he went into the moſt holy place, as being reſerved for this peculiar ſervice, and did therefore put them off again, when he came out from thence, as it is ſaid verſe 23. Yet was not this thus ordered, becauſe this day of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piation, when the prieſt went into the holy of holies, was a faſting day, verſe 29, 30. and therefore it was not fit that he ſhould wear now his glorious garments: for after he was come back out of the moſt holy place, and had put off theſe linen gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, verſe 23. he put on his other glorious attire, and wore them in the remaining ſervice of the day. But other reaſons are given for this by Expoſitours more proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly: as 1. that it was to teach the people thereby that his rich attire was onely for their ſakes, that in them they might behold him as repreſenting the perſon of the Meſſiah, richly adorned with all righteouſneſſe and grace, and not that God was delighted with ſuch rich garments; and ſo he left them off when he went into the place of Gods ſpeciall preſence; and 2. that in this plain attire he might be a fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure of the baſe eſtate of Chriſt upon earth, and how he ſhould without worldly glory perform the work of our redemption.</p>

               <p>We muſt not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that he came forth out of the moſt holy place to kill this goat of the ſin-offering for the people, for the bloud of this goat (as it is ſaid here) was alſo ſprinkled before the mercy-ſeat, and had he gone in once with the bloud of his own ſinne-offering, and then came out and killed this goat for a ſinne-offering for the people, and gone in again to ſprinkle the bloud of that before the mercy-ſeat, then had he gone in twice on this day within the vail, which is expreſſely againſt that of the Apoſtle, Heb. 9. 7. <hi>But into the ſecond went the high prieſt alone once every year, not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out bloud, which he offered for himſelf and for the errours of the people.</hi> Theſe words therefore, <hi>then ſhall he kill the goat of the ſinne-offering,</hi> do onely intend that he killed the bullock firſt for himſelf, verſ. 11. and then this goat for the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; for both of them were killed before he entred into the moſt holy place.</p>

So our ſinnes do defile Gods Church and moſt holy ordinances, and do, aſcend into heaven it ſelf, whereinto we can have no entrance but by bloud. See Heb. 9. 7, 11, 12.</p>

The reaſons of this were two: 1. As by way of chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and for their humiliation, they were all excluded from the places and holy things till they were purged from the uncleanneſſe which they had contracted by their ſinnes; 2.

               <p>This is the onely unbloudy ſacrifice which was appointed in the Law; yet was it not, if it be well conſidered, wholly without bloud: For this and the goat which was killed was indeed but one ſacrifice, the one repreſenting Chriſt dying for our ſinnes, the other Chriſt riſing again for our juſtification, Rom. 4. 25. the one the price paid for our redemption, the other the effect thereof, that God laying our

               <p>Namely with an intent of offering it as a ſacrifice to the Lord: It is not meant of oxen, lambes, or goats killed for their own private uſes,
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:103385:147"/>
but onely of killing theſe beaſts for an offering to the Lord, as is expreſſed in the following words, ver. 4. <hi>And bringeth it not unto the doore of the tabernacle,</hi> &amp;c. For herein lay the ſinne, that they ſhould dare to kill a ſacrifice, and not bring it to the prieſt to be killed by him at the doore of the tabernacle; by forbidding where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of Iſrael was taught, 1. to ſerve God in Chriſt onely, who is the true tabernacle, Heb. 9. 11. in whom God dwelleth among men, and through whom all our ſervices are made acceptable to God: John 14. 6. <hi>I am the way the truth and the life; no man cometh unto the Father but by me;</hi> and 2. that no ſervice is acceptable to him but what is performed in his Church and amongſt his people.</p>
               <q>
                  <bibl>Verſ. 4.</bibl> Bloud ſhall be imputed to that man, &amp;c.]</q>
               <p>That is, his ſacrifice ſhall be no more accepted of God then if he ſlew a man (according to that of the Prophet, Iſai. 66. 3. <hi>He that killeth an ox is as if he ſlew a man)</hi> or rather, he ſhall be repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and proceeded againſt as a murtherer, he ſhall be eſteemed as one that hath ſhed bloud, &amp; ſo ſhall be cut off from among his people. And this happely was the rather ordained, becauſe the bloud of their ſacrifices was, as I may ſay, the ranſom of their perſons that had ſinned, and ſo ſhedding of ſuch bloud otherwiſe then God had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed ſhould be accounted as if they had ſhed the bloud of a man; ſo ſtrictly were they tied in thoſe times to one place for the killing and offering of all their ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices. Indeed we reade of many of the Worthies of God that did after this offer up ſacrifices in other places, as Samuel in Miſpeh, 1. Sam. 7. 9. and in Gilgal, 1. Sam. 11. 15. and in Bethlem, 1. Sam. 11. 2. And David in the floore of Ornan, 2. Sam. 24. 18. and Elias in mount Carmel, 1. King. 18. 22. but that was by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary diſpenſation from God; ordinarily they were tied to bring their ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices to the tabernacle, whereas now again under the Goſpel we have liberty every where to offer up ſpirituall ſacrifices to God. John, 4. 21, 24. <hi>The houre cometh when ye ſhall neither in this mountain nor yet in Jeruſalem worship the Father. God is a ſpirit, and they that worship him must worship him in ſpirit and truth.</hi> So alſo Mal. 1. 11. <hi>From the riſing of the ſunne, even unto the going down of the ſame, my name shall be great among the Gentiles, and in every place incenſe shall be offered unto my name, and a pure offering,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

               <p>That is, which they have been accuſtomed to offer any where in the open fields. This is added to ſhew why the Lord had appointed the man to be ſo ſeverely puniſhed that ſhould kill or offer any ſacrifice any where but in the tabernacle, namely that by the ſeveritie of this law they might the better be reſtrained from the liberty of offering ſacrifices in all places, whereto they had here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore been accuſtomed, and that without ſinne, and might be ſtrictly tied to bring all their ſacrifices, where ever they dwelt, to the doore of the tabernacle unto the prieſt; yea even their peace-offerings, which are particularly mentioned in the laſt clauſe of this verſe: 1. becauſe theſe were moſt uſuall, and were a kind of feaſt to the offerer, whence there was moſt danger leſt they ſhould take liberty to kill and make feaſts of theſe ſacrifices in their private dwellings; and 2. becauſe naming of the leſſe doth the more ſtrongly imply the greater: if they might not offer peace-offerings (which are onely ſaid to be <hi>holy)</hi> where ever they pleaſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

               <p>This which follows is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded alſo to imply why the Lord tied them ſo ſtrictly to one place for their offering up of ſacrifices, namely, that by this means they might be kept in that one uniform way of Gods worſhip which he had appointed, and not bring in every one their own ſuperſtitious devices, which is the next ſtep to idolatry: for that is the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of theſe words, that by being bound to one place the prieſt would now order all things according to Gods direction; and ſo they ſhould be a ſweet <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>That is, when any man hath wronged you in any thing, you ſhall not go away and cloſely nouriſh hatred in your hearts againſt them, or ſecretly carry tales of them to others, and in the mean ſeaſon never open your mouths to them that did the wrong; but quite contrary, you ſhall in a brotherly manner rebuke them for the evil they have done, that ſo you may reclaim them from thoſe evil wayes. This I conceive is the drift of this precept: yet withall it may imply that he that doth not rebuke his brother when he ſees him do amiſſe, doth indeed hate him and not love him, and that becauſe he ſuffers him to runne on in his ſinne, and ſeeks not his amendment.</p>

This expreſſion therefore is not unlike that, Joh. 17. 21. where our Saviour prayed that all true believers might be one with him and his father, <hi>as thou father art in me, and I in thee,</hi> which doth not impart the ſame union, but onely a likeneſſe of union.</p>

The Law that is firſt here delivered is for the putting of him to death <hi>that curſeth his father or his mother,</hi> which is not meant of every wayward word, but of ſuch revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling ſpeeches as they might plainly perceive proceeded from a manifeſt contempt of their parents, of which ſee Exod. 21. 17. By what manner of death they were to die, it is not expreſſed: Some conceive that becauſe ſtoning is appointed both in the beginning and end of the chapter, as may be ſeen ver. 2. and ver. 27. therefore in all other places of this chapter where no other kind of death is expreſſed this of ſtoning is intended. But however in this particular of children that curſed their parents, we may the rather think it was ſo, becauſe elſewhere this kind of death is appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for rebellious children, Deut. 21. 20, 21.</p>

                  <bibl>Verſ. 4.</bibl> But he ſhall not defile himſelf, being a chief man among his people, to profane himſelf.]</q>
               <p>Some reade this place as it is in the margin of our Bibles, <hi>But being a husband among his people he ſhall not defile himſelf for his wife,</hi> &amp;c. and then the ſenſe muſt be, that though the prieſts might defile themſelves for thoſe their neareſt kindred, mentioned in the former verſes, yet they might not defile themſelves for their wives. But the wife being nearer to the husband then the neareſt of his kindred can be, it is hard to ſay why the prieſts ſhould be allowed to defile themſelves for their near kindred and not for their wives: and farre more probably we may conceive that by allowing them to mourn for their near kindred, their defiling themſelves for their wives is implyed as farre more neceſſary; which alſo we may the rather think, becauſe to Ezekiel, being a prieſt, this is given in charge as a ſtrange and unuſuall thing, that he ſhould not mourn for his wife when ſhe dyed, Ezek. 24. 16, &amp;c. and hence it is that few approve of this tranſlation. But reading it then, as it is in the text of our Bibles, <hi>But he ſhall not defile himſelf, being a chief man among his people, to profane himſelf,</hi> all the difficulty lies in knowing what is meant here by being <hi>a chief man among his people:</hi> concerning which I find three ſeverall opinions of Expoſitours. For firſt, ſome underſtand it of the high prieſt, that being a chief man, that is, the high prieſt, he might not defile himſelf, no not for his neareſt kindred; which they ſay is afterwards more fully expreſſed verſ. 10. But becauſe the laws againſt the high prieſts mourning are afterwards ſet down by themſelves, I think it very improbable that this ſhould be meant of the high prieſt. Secondly, ſome underſtand by <hi>a chief man</hi> here the maſter or chief man of the houſe or family, where there is a dead corps to be buried; and ſo take the meaning of the words to be this, That no prieſt ſhould defile himſelf for any but for his near kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred before mentioned, no though he were the chief man or maſter of the familie where they dyed. And thirdly, ſome by <hi>a chief man</hi> underſtand any of the prieſts, and conceive the meaning of this place to be, that though none of the people were allowed to defile themſelves for the dead ſo as to profane themſelves, that is, after the profane manner of the heathen, according to that Law, chap. 19. 18. yet the prieſt eſpecially might not do it, <hi>being a chief man among his people.</hi> So that accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to this interpretation, the emphaſis of this prohibition lies in theſe words, <hi>to profane himſelf.</hi> The inferiour prieſts might defile themſelves for their neareſt kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, but yet not ſo as to profane themſelves, to wit, after the manner of the heathen, <hi>by making baldneſſe upon their heads,</hi> &amp;c. as it is expreſſed in the following verſe: though none of the people might do this, yet not the prieſt eſpecially, <hi>being a chief man among his people.</hi>

               <p>That is, no work appertaining to their earthly buſineſſes or imployments: upon other feſtivall dayes, they were not tyed ſo ſtrictly, except onely the day of Expiation; for upon other feſtivall dayes the reſtraint is, <hi>ye ſhall do no ſervile work therein,</hi> as we may ſee verſ. 7, 8, 21, &amp;c. but upon the Sabbath and the day of Expiation, verſ. 28. the Law runnes, <hi>ye ſhall do no work therein:</hi> and the difference betwixt theſe is commonly held to be this, that on the other feſtivals they were forbidden all ſervile work, that is, all work appertaining to their worldly callings, wherein uſually on other dayes their ſervants were imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but were allowed any work in providing food for the day; and ſo indeed that which was forbidden on the firſt day of unleavened bread in the ſeventh verſe of this chapter under the name of <hi>ſervile work, In the firſt day ye ſhall have an holy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation, ye ſhall do no ſervile work therein,</hi> is expreſſed thus, Exod. 12. 16. <hi>And in the first day there ſhall be an holy conv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

law ſo, as to reſtrain them from thoſe works which were neceſſarily to be done, and therefore they uſed to water their catel, as our Saviour faith, Luke 13. 15. on the Sabbath day, and if need were would pull out of a pit either ox or aſſe that were fallen into it, Luke 14. 5.</p>

                  <hi>That is, to be obſerved in all your dwellings.

               <p>What the ſacrifices were that were to be offered on each of theſe ſeven dayes of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leavened bread, we may ſee Numb. 28. 18, 24.</p>

               <p>That is, on the ſixteenth day of the firſt moneth called Niſan, the ſecond of the ſeven dayes of unleavened bread: Upon the fourteenth day of that moneth the Paſſeover was kept; the fifteenth day was the firſt day of the feaſt of unleavened bread, which day was a Sabbath of reſt, verſ. 7. and is called, <hi>the feaſt,</hi> Numb. 28. 17. and this is the Sabbath here meant: for on the morrow after, being the ſixteenth day of that moneth, the ſheaf of the firſt-fruits was by the care of the Magiſtrate, in the name of all the people, brought unto the prieſt, and this ſheaf was of barley, for that was firſt ripe in the land of Canaan, Ruth. 2. 23. <hi>She kept faſt by the maydens of Boaz to glean unto the end of barley-harveſt and of wheat-harvest;</hi> and Exod. 9. 31, 32. <hi>The barley was in the ear, and the flax was bolled; but the wheat and the rie were not ſmitten, for they were not grown up,</hi> to wit, at the feaſt of the Paſſeover, but wheat-harveſt was after, at Pentecoſt or the feaſt of weeks, as we may ſee Exod. 34. 22. where the feaſt of Pentecoſt, or the feaſt of weeks is alſo called <hi>the feaſt of the firſt-fruits of wheat-harvest.</hi>
               </p>

upon no occaſion were intermitted, and beſides the ſacrifices appointed for every of the ſeven dayes of this ſolemn feaſt of unleavened bread, Numb. 28. 23, 24. For this was appointed peculiarly to accompany this ſheaf of the firſt-fruits, and it figured Chriſt by whom thoſe firſt-fruits were ſanctifyed.</p>

               <q>
                  <bibl>Verſ. 15.</bibl> And ye shall count unto you from the morrow after the Sabbath, &amp;c.]</q>
               <p>Here direction is given how they ſhould know on what day they were to keep the next great feaſt after that of unleavened bread, to wit the feaſt of weeks, or Pente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coſt, namely, that they were to number <hi>from the morrow after the Sabbath,</hi> that is, from the ſixteenth day of the moneth Niſan (as is before ſaid in the note upon verſ. 11.) which was the very day that they brought the ſheaf of the wave-offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſeven compleat Sabbaths, that is ſeven compleat weeks, which was nine and fourty dayes, and that then on the morrow after the ſeventh Sabbath, that is, after the ſeventh week, which was the fiftieth day, they were to keep the feaſt of weeks or Pentecoſt, and to offer a new meat-offering unto the Lord: which ſhows the reaſon why this feaſt was called <hi>the feaſt of weeks,</hi> namely, becauſe it was ſeven weeks after the Paſſeover, or the beginning of the feaſt of unleavened bread; as alſo why it was afterward called in the New Teſtament, <hi>Pentecost,</hi> Acts 2. 1. to wit, from the Greek word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which ſignifieth <hi>fifty,</hi> becauſe it was fifty dayes after the firſt and great day of unleavened bread: for they began to num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber theſe fifty dayes from the morrow after that Sabbath incluſively, which was the ſecond day of unleavened bread, the day whereon the ſheaf of firſt-fruits was offered.</p>
               <q>
                  <bibl>Verſ. 17.</bibl> Ye shall bring out of your habitations two wave-loaves, of two tenth deals, &amp;c.]</q>
               <p>That is, on the feaſt of Pentecoſt you ſhall bring this offering, which was to be offered as the firſt-fruits of their wheat-harveſt, as the ſheaf offered at the Paſſeover, mentioned verſ. 10. was brought as the firſt-fruits of their barley-harveſt: now it is expreſſed, that theſe two wave-loaves were to be brought out of their habitations, either to ſignifie that theſe two loaves were to be made of the new wheat of their own land, not of forein corn or bought of ſtrangers; or elſe to ſignifie that though there were but one ſheaf of firſt-fruits offered at the Paſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over in the name of all the people, yet now every family was to bring two wave-loaves of firſt-fruits out of their ſeverall habitations. But indeed becauſe the ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices mentioned in the following verſe, that were offered together with theſe loaves, were not brought ſeverally by every family, but provided at the common charge, and offered in the name of the whole Church; and becauſe that it is ſaid expreſly verſ. 20. that theſe two loaves of the firſt-fuits were waved by the prieſt together with the peace-offerings<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which could not be if every familie in Iſrael brought two loaves, therefore I onely think that the onely reaſon why it is ſaid, <hi>Ye shall bring</hi>
                  <pb n="302" facs="tcp:103385:157"/>
                  <hi>two wave-loaves out of your habitations,</hi> was to ſignifie that the loaves were to be made of the wheat of their own land.</p>
               <q>They ſhall be of fine flowre, they ſhall be baken with leaven, they are the firſt-fruits unto the Lord.]</q>
               <p>Thusthere is a difference made betwixt the meat-offerings which were in part burnt upon the altar, and were therefore ever without leaven, Levit. 2. 11. and theſe of the firſt-fruits, which where wholly for the prieſts food, and therefore allowed to be leavened.</p>
               <q>
                  <bibl>Verſ. 18.</bibl> And ye shall offer with the bread, ſeven lambes, without blemish, of the firſt year, and one young bullock, &amp;c.]</q>
               <p>In Numb. 28. 27. there is appointed two bullocks and one ramme, here one bullock and two rammes; the reaſon of this difference we may conceive was this: Thoſe were as the peculiar ſacrifices of that feaſt-day, theſe are a further addition in reſpect of the two loaves, as a particular te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of their thankfulneſſe for the fruits of the earth, and of their faith in Chriſt, by whom they were reſtored to the uſe of the creatures, and their ſacrifices of praiſe made acceptable to God.</p>
               <q>
                  <bibl>Verſ. 19.</bibl> Then ye shall ſacrifice one kid of the goats for a ſinne-offering, &amp;c.]</q>
               <p>Lev. 4. 14. a bullock is preſcribed for a ſinne-offering of the people, and nothing was to be eaten thereof, it was to be burnt without the camp: But this was for ſome ſpeciall ſinne of the congregation, whereas the ſacrifice here appointed was in generall for all their ſinnes, and was therefore in the kind of a common ſacrifice, whence a goat is appointed, and the prieſt to have the remainder.</p>
               <q>
                  <bibl>Verſ. 20.</bibl> They shall be holy to the Lord for the priest.]</q>
               <p>Whereas ordinarily the prieſt had but the breaſt and the right ſhoulder of the peace-offerings, Lev. 7. 32, 33. &amp;c. <hi>The breast shall be Aarons and his ſonnes: And the right shoulder shall ye give unto the prieſt of the ſacrifices of your peace-offerings,</hi> &amp;c. Here he had all, becauſe this was offered in generall for all the congregation, and ſo no par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular man had right to eat thereof, therefore it belonged to the prieſt wholly.</p>
               <q>
                  <bibl>Verſ. 21.</bibl> And ye shall proclaim on the ſelf ſame day, that it may be an holy convocation unto you, &amp;c.]</q>
               <p>This was the feaſt-day of Pentecoſt, or of Weeks, whereon the two loaves and the ſacrifices before mentioned were offered unto the Lord; and it was inſtituted partly as a memoriall of their coming out of Egypt, Deut. 16. 10, 12. <hi>Thou shalt keep the feaſt of Weeks unto the Lord thy God, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as he hath bleſſed thee.

Now the firſt day of this moneth God here appoints them to keep a Sabbath, that is, a ſolemn feaſt-day; and it was called <hi>the feaſt of trumpets,</hi> becauſe it was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>olemnized with blow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of trumpets. Indeed the firſt day of every moneth, which was their new Moon, they kept as an holy day, a day of ſpeciall ſolemnity, and thereon the prieſts did blow with their ſilver trumpets over their ſacrifices, Numb. 10. 10. <hi>In the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of your moneths ye shall blow with your trumpets over your burnt-offerings,</hi> &amp;c. But the firſt day of this ſeventh moneth was kept as a farre more ſolemn feſtivall, and that with blowing of trumpets in way of rejoycing, as it may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably be thought, throughout all the cities of Iſrael. And the end of this feſtivall was, 1. to be a memoriall that this was the firſt day, the beginning of their New year for civil afairs, whereon it was therefore fitting that they ſhould with rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing acknowledge the bleſſings injoyed in the foregoing year; 2. to be a memoriall to them when they were come into Canaan of the ſeverall victories which God had given them over their enemies, where the prieſts with the holy trumpets did ſound an alarm. See Numb. 31. 6. 3. That it might be a preparation for the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing day of atonement, their ſolemn faſt-day on the tenth day of this moneth, that ſo by the ſounding of the trumpets they might be put in mind to wake out of the ſleep of ſinne, and with trembling faſting and prayer to turn unto the Lord: and 4. to put them in mind of the ſpeciall holineſſe of this moneth; for as the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth day of every week was a Sabbath, and every ſeventh year was kept holy as a Sabbaticall year; ſo the Lord would have the ſeventh moneth of every year to be holy in ſome ſingular manner above the reſt of the moneths: and therefore though it was not wholly ſpent in ſacred feſtivities, yet there were more holy-dayes in this moneth then in all the year beſides, to wit, the feaſt of trumpets, the feaſt of expia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the feaſt of tabernacles.</p>

               <p>The common opinion is, that thoſe twelve cakes of ſhewbread, repreſenting the twelve tribes of Iſrael, were not ſet one by another, but ſix one upon another, and ſix one upon another.

people, who would not ſuffer it unpuniſhed in one that was the ſonne of a ſtranger by the fathers ſide. The inſerting of this ſtory in this place makes it more then probable, that it was done whilſt they were yet in the deſert of Sinai, even whilſt the Lord was giving theſe Laws to Moſes which are before mentioned, as is expreſſed in the next chapter, ver. 1. Whether the Egyptian had this ſonne by Shelomith in marriage, or by fornication, we cannot ſay: but that this their ſonne the blaſphemer had embraced the religion of the Iſraelites, it is very likely, both becauſe he came away with them out of Egypt, and alſo becauſe he is here ſaid to have gone out amongſt the children of Iſrael, which implies more then his going in their company, namely, that he went out amongſt them as one of them.</p>

               <p>His ſinne I conceive was not raſh, vain, and unadviſed mentioning Gods name either in ſwearing, curſing the man with whom he was to contend, or otherwiſe; but of an higher nature (though even theſe are blaſphemy) even ſome execration or reprochfull ſpeeches uttered in his fury directly againſt God: as if for inſtance we ſhould ſuppoſe this, that in the heat of contention the Iſraelite upbraid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him with his idolatrous father, and denying him to be a true member of the Church of God he ſhould thereupon ſpeak ſcornfully and opprobriouſly of the God of Iſrael, ſlighting the priviledge of being one of his people. Some ſuch blaſphemy I conceive this was, and that becauſe the Law which God gave them upon this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion ſpeaks of curſing God, ver. 15. <hi>Whoſoever curſeth his God ſhall bear his ſinne;</hi> not curſing in Gods name, but directly and expreſſely of curſing God.</p>

               <p>That is, thoſe that heard him were to come forth, and laying their hands upon his head to give in evidence againſt him, and ſo thereupon he was to be condemned, and the congregation was to ſtone him. Now this ceremony of the witneſſes laying their hands upon his head was 1. to ſignifie, that they did charge this ſinne upon him, and approve of the puniſhment that was to be inflicted for it; 2. that having witneſſed nothing but the truth, they were free from his death, but his bloud muſt be upon his own head; 3. to imply that he was to be ſacrificed as it were to the juſtice of God: for as thoſe that brought any ſacrifice to the tabernacle, were to lay their hand upon the head of the ſacrifice, thereby ſignifying their deſire and faith, that the death of that ſacrifice might and ſhould ſatisfie the juſtice of God in their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half; ſo here the laying of the witneſſes hands upon the head of the blaſphemer did ſignifie their deſire that God would accept of his puniſhment as a ſacrifice offered to the ſatisfying of his juſtice, and not puniſh the land and people for it.</p>

               <p>Theſe Laws were given to the Iſraelites, upon the occaſion of the foregoing ſtory of the blaſphemer that was ſtoned. Evident it is

that theſe are two diſtinct Laws, <hi>Whoſoever ſhall curſe his God ſhall bear his ſinne,</hi> and, <hi>He that blaſphemeth the name of the Lord, he ſhall ſurely be put to death;</hi> and yet hard it is to ſay wherein the difference lies between curſing and blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming the name of the Lord. But the beſt reſolution of this doubt, I conceive, is this, that by <hi>curſing God</hi> is meant when a man ſhall directly and purpoſely ſpeak re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prochfully of God, and by <hi>blaſpheming the name of the Lord,</hi> is meant when men do ſo profanely mention the name of God, either in curſing or otherwiſe, that what they ſay of God tends much to the reproch and diſhonour of God, though they do not directly ſpeak againſt God.</p>

But againſt this manner of accounting the year Jubile, there may be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall ſtrong objections made, which cannot well be anſwered: as 1. that the Jews do conſtantly reckon otherwiſe, making the Jubile every fiftieth year, not concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring with the Sabbaticall year: 2. that according to this manner of accounting eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry year of Jubile was then to be counted twice, as the laſt of one fifty years, and the firſt of another; and beſides, in the computation for the firſt fifty years, there was no Jubile before to be included: and 3. that it had been ſuperfluous to forbid, as ver 11. all ſowing and reaping in the year of Jubile, if it had alwayes concurred with the ſeventh Sabbaticall year, ſince all ſuch works had then been unlawfull, even in regard that it was a ſeventh year. And therefore I conceive that the more probable opinion is that, which is commonly held by Expoſitours, namely, that they did reckon ſeven times ſeven years, which was nine and fourty years, and then the next year after, to wit, the fiftieth year, was the year of Jubile: and this year was not reckoned in the Sabbath of years following, but the one and fiftieth year was the firſt of the next ſeven years; for elſe they ſhould not have ſowed and reaped ſix years in this week of years.</p>

A great diſpute there is amongſt Expoſitours, when the year of Jubile began: Some hold that though it were proclaimed on the ſeventh moneth, the moneth Tiſri, yet it began not till the ſpring following, in the moneth Niſan: but this is no way probable; for the time of ſowing was about the ſeventh moneth, and it is not likely they ſowed that which becauſe of the following Jubile
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:103385:161"/>
they might not reap. I make no queſtion therefore but the year of Jubile began on this ſeventh moneth, but whether it began on the firſt day of this moneth, as the Jews generally hold, or not till the tenth day, is ſomewhat queſtionable; yet the laſt ſeems to me moſt probable, becauſe it may ſeem ſtrange, that it ſhould begin ten dayes before it was proclaimed.</p>

                  <bibl>Verſ. 10.</bibl> And ye ſhall hallow the fiftieth year, and proclaim liberty through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all the land, &amp;c.]</q>
               <p>That is, ye ſhall ſet it apart to be an holy year, and ſhall proclaim liberty throughout all the land, to wit, to your brethren that had been ſold to you for ſervants, who ſhall hereupon be ſet at liberty. Now the year of Jubile was called an <hi>holy year,</hi> becauſe it was ſeparated from the ordinary imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of other years in tilling and ſowing their land, &amp;c. that they might be at more leiſure to ſpend it in holy imployments, and that it might be to them a year of holy rejoycing before the Lord; and withall becauſe it was to be a type of that evangelicall Jubile at the coming of Chriſt, when by the trumpet of the Goſpel, firſt ſounded by the Baptiſt, and after by Chriſt and his Apoſtles, there ſhould be great joy proclaimed unto all nations; whence it is that the time of the Goſpel is called <hi>the year of Gods redeemed,</hi> Eſa. 63. 4. and <hi>the acceptable year of the Lord,</hi> Eſa. 61. 2. <hi>the accepted time, and the day of ſalvation,</hi> 2. Cor. 6. 2. One of the main priviledges of this year was that which is here mentioned, that all their ſervants were ſet at liberty. Ordinarily when their brethren were ſold to them for ſervants, they were to ſerve them ſix years; but if the year of Jubile came after the firſt or ſecond year, they were preſently ſet free: yea even thoſe that at other ordinary times did refuſe to be ſet free, and ſo had their ears bored through, and were by the Law thereupon <hi>to ſerve for ever,</hi> Exod. 21. 16. were yet ſet free at the year of Jubile. And herein was the year of Jubile, a notable type of the evangelicall Jubile at the coming of Chriſt, when all Gods redeemed ones were ſet free from the bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage of the Law, Satan, ſinne, and death, Joh. 8. 36. <hi>If the ſonne ſhall make you free, you ſhall be free indeed.</hi>
               </p>
               <q>It ſhall be a Jubile unto you, and ye ſhall return every man to his poſſeſſion.]</q>
               <p>This was another priviledge of the year of Jubile, That when that year came all the land that had been ſold returned to the owners that had ſold it, or to their heirs: for no man might ſell his land for ever, ver. 23. but onely for ſo many years as were behind from the ſale to the year of Jubile, and then the owners entred upon the land again. And this was the reaſon why Naboth would not ſell his vineyard to Ahab, to wit, for ever. 1. King. 21. 3. <hi>The Lord forbid it me,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>that I ſhould give the inheritance of my fathers unto thee.</hi> Now the reaſons of this Law were, 1. that it might prevent the confuſion of the tribes by the alienation of their ſeverall portions in the land of Canaan from one to another; 2. that it might be a barre in the way of the rich, that they might not hope to ſwallow up the inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of their poore brethren, and ſo to enlarge their own; 3. that it might be a perpetuall memoriall to them that God had planted them in the land, becauſe they might not ſell it, the Lord challenging the land to be ſtill his by a peculiar right, and willing them onely to eſteem themſelves as ſojourners therein with him, whence it is called <hi>the Lords land,</hi> Hoſ. 9. 3. <hi>They ſhall not dwell in the Lords</hi>

                  <hi>land;</hi> and Eſai. 8. 8. <hi>The ſtretching out of his wings ſhall fill the breadth of thy land, O Immanuel.</hi> And fourthly, That it might be a figure of our recovering by Chriſt, at the evangelicall Jubile, that heavenly inheritance which we had loſt by ſinne; and that the heavenly Canaan which God had prepared for his in Chriſt c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>pon theſe houſes, if not redeemed within ſo ſhort a time, much coſt might be beſtowed by him that had bought them, for the alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, repairing or enlarging of them; and therefore it was not fit they ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed as lands were: and on the otherſide in many years they might be much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayed, and ſo not be reſtored in the ſame condition they were in, when they were ſold, as lands might: Secondly, becauſe the perpetuall alienating of theſe houſes in walled cities did not make ſuch confuſion in the tribes, as the alienating of their lands, ſince it cannot be thought that in populous cities, onely men of one and the ſame tribe inhabited: Thirdly, becauſe men might better part with their houſes then their ground, that ſhould yield them food and ſuſtenance, yea theſe houſes might be burthenſome to the owners becoming poore, rather then uſefull.</p>

               <p>The Lord having given them laws hitherto concerning the neceſſary duties of his ſervice, concludeth now with this concerning vows and voluntary ſervices, <hi>When a man ſhall make a ſingular vow, the perſons ſhall be for the Lord by thy eſtimation.</hi> That is, when any man ſhall after a ſingular manner ſeparate any thing by vow from common uſe for the Lords ſervice, <hi>the perſons</hi> (ſuppoſing it be ſome perſon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whether man or woman that is vowed) <hi>ſhall be for the Lord accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to thy estimation,</hi> that is, they ſhall be thenceforth the Lords, and accordingly either they ſhall be ſet apart to the Lords ſervice, or elſe they ſhall be redeemed <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to thy eſtimation,</hi> to wit, according to that value which the prieſts, by the direction which thou Moſes ſhalt now give, ſhall ſet upon them: for it was Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to whom the Lord now ſpake, but it was the prieſt that did value that <hi>which was vowed,</hi> as is evident ver. 12. though according to that direction which Moſes by Gods command did now preſcribe them. Now for theſe vows of perſons, we muſt know that they were uſually made in time of ſome affliction or diſtreſſe; as when married perſons had no child<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they did ſometimes vow that if the Lord would give them a child, they would give themſelves or that their child unto the Lord, which was Hannahs vow, 1. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>m. 1. 11. and ſo in times of ſickneſſe, or any other diſtreſſe, they were wont to vow unto the Lord delivering them, that they would give ſuch and ſuch perſons, themſelves or their children, over whom they had power, unto the Lord. And if it be queſtioned, after what manner and to what uſe they were vow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto the Lord: To this ſome Expoſitours anſwer, That in caſe it was a Levite that was vowed, he was then bound by that vow to ſerve <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>lwayes in the tabernacle or temple (whereas otherwiſe he ſhould have ſerved there onely in his courſe) and ſuch an one they ſay could not be redeemed. But if the perſon vowed were of any other tribe, they were onely vowed to ſuch ſervice of the tabernacle, as they not being of the tribe of Levi were capable of, as for drawing of water, or hewing of wood, which the Gibeonites afterwards did, Joſh. 9. 27. or if they were women, for ſpinning for making the prieſts garments, and providing thoſe things that were neceſſary for the repair of the tabernacle, and other ſuch like ſervices, which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly they did perform, or elſe paid the price of their redemption here preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed.
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:103385:164"/>
But others again hold that the aim and intention of theſe perſonall vows, was onely that they ſhould pay the price of their redemption to the prieſts, which was imployed either for the maintenance of the prieſts, Numb. 18. 14. or elſe for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations of the Sanctuary, 2. Kings 12. 4, 5.</p>

               <p>Why this was enjoyned, ſee the note before upon verſ. 13.

               <p>That is, if a man ſhall vow unto the Lord ſome part of a field that came by inheritance (for direction is afterwards given, verſ. 22. for fields purchaſed of others, wherein onely they ſhould have right unto the year of Jubile) the prieſt then was to ſet an eſtimation upon it according to the quantity of ſeed that would ſow the land ſo vowed, and that price the owner of the land was to pay to the prieſt if he would redeem it, and a fifth part over and above. This vowing of ſome part of their land unto the Lord was uſually done, in expectation of having their fields yield the greater increaſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the price here ſet for the redemption of ſuch land was, that they were to pay according to the rate of fifty ſhekels for ſo much land as required an homer of barley ſeed to ſow it, as for inſtance, if an homer would ſow it, then they were to pay fifty ſhekels of ſilver for the redemption of it; if it required two homers to ſow it, then they were to pay a hundred ſhekels; if three homers, then a hundred and fifty ſhekels, &amp;c. and again, if half an homer would ſow it, then they were to pay twenty five ſhekels, and ſo ratably they paid for all land they had vowed according to the quantity of ſeed that would ſow it. Indeed it is queſtioned amongſt Expoſitours whether this ſumme ſet for the redemption of ſuch land was but once paid, or whether ſo much was paid yearly till the year of Jubile came. This laſt many do hold, and that becauſe they judge that fifty ſhekels was not a valuable conſideration (unleſſe it were paid yearly till the Jubile came) for ſo much land as required an homer of ſeed to ſow it. But doubtleſſe in rating the land that was vow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed there was a favourable reſpect had to the owner, neither did the Lord intend i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Three ſeverall wayes this clauſe of the law concerning devoted things is underſtood by Expoſitours: firſt, ſome underſtand it onely of beaſts, yea principally of unclean beaſts, <hi>devoted of men,</hi> that is, devoted by men, conceiving that this is added to ſatisfie a doubt, namely, that if things devoted might not be ſold, what then ſhall be done with thoſe devoted unclean beaſts which were not fit for the Lords uſe? to which they ſay an anſwer is here given, namely, that however they might not be ſold, but muſt be put to death. Again ſecondly, ſome underſtand it generally of all devoted things, whether men or beaſts or lands, &amp;c. and theſe by the laſt clauſe, wherein it is ſaid, that ſuch things <hi>ſhall ſurely be put to death,</hi> underſtand a finall ſeparating ſuch things from all civill uſe unto the Lord, either by death or otherwiſe, to wit, that ſuch things were either to be put to death, or elſe that they were to be irrecoverably cut off from all civill uſe, which in a meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phoricall phraſe is a kind of death, ſuch things being civilly dead (as we uſe to ſay) in regard of the former owner. But thirdly, ſome underſtand it onely of men that are devoted: for men, they ſay, are here mentioned, not as the perſons devoting, but as the perſons devoted; and therefore it is not tranſlated, <hi>None devoted, which ſhall be devoted by men,</hi> but, <hi>None devoted, which ſhall be devoted of men,</hi> or from amongſt men, <hi>ſhall be redeemed,</hi> that is, no men that are devoted ſhall be redeemed, but ſhall ſurely be put to death. And this ſeems the moſt probable Expoſition, and moſt agreeable with our tranſlation. Onely then it muſt be underſtood of ſuch as were devoted unto deſtruction, which was done ſometimes by a ſpeciall and extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary vow, and ſo the Canaanites were devoted, Numb. 21. 2. <hi>Iſrael vowed a vow unto the Lord, and ſaid, If thou wilt indeed deliver this people into my hand, then will I utterly deſtroy their cities;</hi> or elſe by Gods ſpeciall command, and ſo the inhabitants of Jericho were devoted, Joſh. 6. 17. and the Amalekites, 1. Sam. 15. 3. for if we extend it to the devoting of men to Gods ſervice, then that laſt clauſe, <hi>they shall ſurely be put to death,</hi> cannot be meant otherwiſe then in that metapho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricall ſenſe before ſpoken of, namely that ſuch were to be wholly given up for ever to the Lord, as men dead unto the world, and ſo Samuel, they ſay, was devoted to the Lord.</p>

But what became, may ſome ſay, of the Levites male-children that were under a moneth, and ſo not now numbred amongſt thoſe that were to be taken for the firſt-born? I anſwer doubtleſſe the whole tribe was conſecrated to the Lord, and therefore we may probably conceive that either by the ſpeciall providence of God there was none at preſent under that age, or elſe thoſe few that were under that age were taken in exchange for ſo many of the firſt-born of the Iſraelites that were afterwards born, who ſhould otherwiſe have paid for their redemption.</p>

               <p>In the former chapter all the Levites of a moneth old and upward were numbred, becauſe all were numbred that were to be taken in ſtead of the firſt-born, and ſo to be accounted as thoſe that were ſet apart as holy to the Lord; but here onely thoſe that were thirty years old and upward are numbred, to wit, thoſe that were to be imployed in carrying the tabernacle and the holy things thereof. Indeed in the eighth chapter of this book, verſ. 24. it is ſaid that the Levites ſhould enter upon their ſervice at five and twenty years old: to which ſome anſwer out of the Hebrew traditions, that at five and twenty years they were admitted to be inſtructed and trained up to the ſervice of the tabernacle, but did not actually enter upon the ſervice till they were thirty years old. But I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the truer anſwer is, either that they entred upon the ſervice of the tabernacle at five and twenty years, but not upon this of removing and carrying the tabernacle and the holy things therein (of which at preſent Moſes onely ſpeaks) untill they were thirty years old, becauſe a good ſettled ſtrength of body was required to that

Exod. 40. 17. a full moneth before the numbring of the people, whereof Moſes ſpake in the beginning of this book (for the charge for that was given <hi>on the first day of the ſecond moneth,</hi> chap. 1. 1.) and ſo they conceive that this is here inſerted, though done a moneth before, onely becauſe theſe things for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly offered by the Princes were now given to the Levites. But then others conceive that theſe waggons and oxen were now offered by the Princes in the order as it is here ſet down, after the tribes were numbred and placed in their ſeverall ſtations round about the tabernacle; and that therefore by theſe words, <hi>And it came to paſſe on the day that Moſes had fully ſet up the tabernacle and had anointed it,</hi> &amp;c. onely thus much is intended, that theſe things were brought and offered by the Princes after that Moſes had fully finiſhed the erection of the tabernacle, &amp;c. and the ordering of all things belonging thereto, amongſt which we may well reckon the placing of the tribes in their ſeverall ſtations, and the Levites alſo in their pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces round about the tabernacle.

The Iſraelites came into the wilderneſſe of Sinai in the beginning of the third moneth of the firſt year, Exod. 19. 1. and now the cloud being taken up from off the tabernacle, and going into the forefront of their camp, they went out of the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe on the twentieth day of the ſecond moneth in the ſecond year, about ſix dayes after thoſe men had kept the Paſſeover that being defiled by the dead could not keep it at the appointed ſeaſon, whereof Moſes ſpake before, chap. 9. 6, &amp;c. So that here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it is evident that they ſtayed in this wilderneſſe of Sinai a full year wanting nine or ten dayes: and though there be here onely mention made of the taking up of the cloud, which was the ſigne that they were to be gone thence; yet withall God ſpake unto them to remove, Deut. 1. 6, 7, 8. <hi>The Lord our God ſpake unto us in Horeb, ſaying, Ye have dwelt long enough in this mount; turn you and take your journey and go into the land of the Amorites,</hi> &amp;c. and thus both by word and ſigne God called them from Sinai, the place of bondage, by reaſon of the law there given, Gal. 4. 24, 25. unto the land of promiſe, which figured the ſtate of grace and free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome by Jeſus Chriſt.</p>

               <p>Some conceive that it is Raguel the Medianite, and not Hobab that is here called Moſes father in law, even the ſame that is elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where called Reüel Exod. 2. 18. and Jethro, Exod. 3. 1. and that Hobab, to whom Moſes now ſpake, being the ſonne of this Raguel or Jethro was the bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in law of Moſes, who ſtayed ſtill with Moſes at mount Sinai after their father Reguel or Jethro was returned home to his own countrey, Exod. 28. 27. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Hobab is elſewhere expreſſely called, according to our tranſlation, the father in law of Moſes, Judge 4. 11. it muſt needs be he alſo that is here alſo called Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes father in law, even the ſame that is in Exodus called Jethro and Reüel, and that Raguel the Midianite was his father, as is noted before upon Exod. 3. 1. And if it be objected that Jethro the father in law of Moſes departed from him before, Exod. 18. 27. to this I anſwer, as before in the note upon that place, that though his go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from Moſes be mentioned there, yet it was not till now that he left him, when both Moſes and the Iſraelites were to depart mount Sinai.</p>

               <p>That is, go not away from us, or if thou goeſt away return again, Though Moſes had lived fourty years about theſe parts, yet knowing the difficulties they were likely to meet with in their paſſage through the wilderneſſe, he much deſired the ſtay of Hobab with them, who knew the countrey farre better then himſelf, and might be a great help unto them, and therefore he preſſeth him again to ſtay with them, that he might be to them <hi>in ſtead of eyes,</hi> that is, that he might ſhew them how they might beſt advantage them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in diſpoſing their camp.

But becauſe it is expreſſely ſaid, Exod. 18. 27. that this Hobab or Jethro the father in law of Moſes was diſmiſſed by Moſes and returned again in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his own land, it ſeems more probable that he did now return home to his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, as is there ſaid.

               <p>The word in the originall (here tranſlated <hi>complained)</hi> may alſo be rendred as it is in the margin, <hi>were as it were complainers,</hi> and ſo may intimate that they did onely ſecretly begin to murmur and mutter, and not break forth into ſuch an open complaint as afterwards they did at Kibroth Hattaavah, when they luſted for meat. Indeed many Expoſitours underſtand this and that afterwards mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ver. 4. of one and the ſame murmuring, which they ſay is firſt ſummarily ſet down here, and afterwards more particularly related in the ſequele of the chapter, and eſpecially becauſe, Pſal. 78. 19, 20, 21. the fire that now devoured the people is mentioned, as the puniſhment of their luſting for fleſh, <hi>They ſaid, Can God fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh a table in the wilderneſſe? Therefore the Lord heard this and was wroth; ſo a fire was kindled againſt Jacob, and anger alſo came up against Iſrael.</hi> But in that Pſalm it is evident that the ſeverall paſſages of their murmuring are not related hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorically in order, but many things are promiſcuouſly inſerted here and there. However evident it is that the murmuring for fleſh, mentioned ver. 4. was another from this, becauſe it is ſaid here that they <hi>wept again,</hi> and beſides that was done at Kibroth Hattaavah, this at Taberah. The cauſe of their preſent complaining in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed is not expreſſed, but in all likelyhood we may conceive it was becauſe they were weary of following the ark three dayes journey through the wilderneſſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether without intermiſſion, whereof there was mention made in the latter end of the former chapter ver. 33.</p>

What the ground or occaſion of that quarrell was may ſeem queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable: onely thus much is more then probable, firſt, that one main ground of their quarrell was their envy at the preheminence of Moſes above them, as appears by that their expoſtulation, verſ. 2. <hi>Hath the Lord indeed ſpoken onely by Moſes? Hath he not ſpoken alſo by us?</hi> Becauſe Miriam was a propheteſſe, Exod. 15. 20. and Aaron the high prieſt, and imployed by God together with Moſes in fetching the Iſraelites out of Egypt, therefore they grudged that the ſupreme power of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhould be ſolely in Moſes.

               <p>The drift of Moſes prayer, and ſo alſo of his alledging theſe words, which the Lord had ſpoken concerning himſelf, being to procure of God that he would ſhew mercy to the Iſraelites, and not to poure out his wrath upon them as their ſinne had deſerved, it may ſeem ſtrange that he ſhould adde the laſt clauſe, that God would by no means clear the guilty, but would viſit the iniquity of the fathers upon the children, &amp;c. But for the reſolving of this doubt, we muſt know, that theſe words being taken joyntly with thoſe which went before do no way croſſe the aim of Moſes prayer, and that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he did not ſue to God that he ſhould not puniſh the ſinne of this people, but onely that he would not utterly deſtroy them, as he had before threatened, verſ. 12. and accordingly the drift of Moſes plea in theſe words is this, That ſince God had ſaid of himſelf that he was a long-ſuffering God, and that though he would by no means clear the guilty, &amp;c. yet withall he was a God of great mercy, and ready to forgive the iniquities of his people, that he would now, according to this which he had ſaid, deal with this people, namely, that he would in wrath remember mercy, and not ſweep them quite away as dung from the face of the earth.</p>

               <p>There is a Law given concerning the expiation of a ſinne ignorantly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by the whole congregation, Levit. 4. 13. But there is a manifeſt difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt this and that: There the Law ſpeaks of doing that which ſhould not be done, here, of not doing all which ſhould be done; there the ſacrifice which the congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation ſhould bring is onely a bullock for a ſinne-offering, here they are willed to bring a bullock for a burnt-offering, and a kid of the goats for a ſinne-offering<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And the ground of this difference I conceive is this, becauſe that Law concerned ſinnes of doing evil forbidden, this onely concerns the ſinne of neglecting thoſe ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remoniall duties commanded by the Law, which may be the more readily yielded if we conſider the occaſion of inſerting this Law in this place. Having ſpoken of the firſt-fruits, of the firſt of their dough, he immediately added this Law, to ſhew what ſhould be done in caſe any of thoſe things concerning the externall worſhip of God, either firſt-fruits or any other thing that ought to be brought to the prieſts and to the tabernacle, were om<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>That the Sabbath-breaker was to die, they knew, ſee Exod. 31. 14. and 35. 2. but by what death he ſhould die, or whether this gathering of ſticks made him obnoxious to that ſentence, that they were not fully reſolved in: Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent it ſeems it was that he had done it preſumptuouſly, yet it was doubtfull whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this fact were within the compaſſe of that Law or no. And therefore Moſes inquires, not willing to take away his life without certain direction from the mouth of God.</p>

                  <bibl>Verſ. 38.</bibl> Speak unto the children of Iſrael, and bid them that they make them fringes, &amp;c.]</q>
               <p>The main end of theſe fringes was to put them in mind of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments of God, as it is afterwards expreſſed, ver. 29. that every time they looked upon their garments, and ſaw thoſe fringes, they might by the help of this memoriall remember that they were Gods peculiar people, conſecrated to his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and bound to his Laws, and therefore might not walk, as others, after their own wayes: and therefore it was that the Phariſees, to the end they might ſeem religious above others, did make the fringes on their garments ſo very broad, Mat. 23. 5. <hi>They enlarge,</hi> ſaith our Saviour, <hi>the border of their garments,</hi> or, the fringes of their garments, for ſo the originall word may well be tranſlated. Yea, and our Saviour himſelf did conform himſelf to this Law, as appears, Luke 8. 44. where it is ſaid, that the woman that had the iſſue of bloud <hi>touched the border,</hi> or, the fringe, <hi>of his garment.</hi>
               </p>
               <q>And that they put upon the fringe of the borders a ribband of blue.]</q>
               <p>This heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coloured ribband taught them the heavenly affection they ſhould have to all the Law, and how holy their converſation ſhould be.</p>
               <q>
                  <bibl>Verſ. 39.</bibl> And it ſhall be unto you for a fringe, that ye may look upon it, &amp;c.]</q>

That is, this is the end of making theſe fringes, that ye may look upon them and remember all the commandments of the Lord, and do them, that is, that the ſight of this fringe may put you in mind to keep them, and that ye ſeek not after your own heart, and your own eyes, after which you uſe to go a whoring, that is, that ye may not find out any ſuperſtitious in ventions of your own deviſing in my wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip (which who ſo doth goes a whoring from God) but may content your ſelves with that which is preſcribed by the Law. So that this was more particularly the end of theſe fringes, that they might be reſtrained from their own devices in the worſhip of God, and kept to the direction of his Law.</p>

But doubtleſſe

for the preſent they made the quarrel onely about the prieſthood: nor was it ſo much to make all the Levites equall with Aaron and his ſonnes (though that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pely the Levites did hope would prove the iſſue of it, <hi>ſeek ye the prieſthood alſo?</hi> ſaid Moſes, ver. 10.) as that all the people might as prieſts offer their own ſacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; and therefore all the two hundred and fifty conſpiratours, who were of ſeverall tribes, were appointed to come with their cenſers to burn incenſe before the Lord; and concerning Dathan and Abiram, who were Reubenites, it is ſaid ver. 15. when Moſes ſent for them, and they refuſed to come to him, that <hi>Moſes was very wroth with them, and ſaid unto the Lord, Reſpect not thou their offerings,</hi> which muſt needs be meant of the incenſe they were to offer; yea and in the following chapter, the laying up of the rods of all the tribes before the Lord, that the Lord might ſhew that none but Aaron and his family might meddle with the work of the prieſthood, makes it moſt evident that the plea of theſe men was, that all the tribes might offer their ſacrifices unto the Lord.</p>

               <p>This branch of the Law, that the aſhes of the heifer muſt be gathered up by a man that is clean, and laid up without the camp in a clean place, was becauſe they were now conſecrated to a holy uſe, however the man that gathered them was thereby made unclean (as is expreſſed in the following verſe) becauſe they were the remainder of a heifer ſlain, as I may ſay, for the ſinnes of the people: and hereby was ſignified that Chriſt our ſacrifice was pure in himſelf, though made ſinne for us; yea and ſome Expoſitours adde that this laying up of theſe aſhes in a clean place ſignified that Chriſt ſhould be buried in a new tombe, <hi>wherein never man before was laid,</hi> Luke 23. 53.</p>

               <p>This was the way which the Lord preſcribed for the curing of the Iſraelites, that were bitten with fiery ſerpents, namely, that Moſes ſhould make a fiery ſerpent, that is, a fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure or repreſentation of thoſe fiery ſerpents wherewith they were ſtung, and that of braſſe, as we may ſee in the following verſe, the better to repreſent their fiery quality, becauſe braſſe is of a fiery colour (and therefore it is ſaid of the Cheru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bims that Ezekiel ſaw in a viſion, Ezek. 1. 7. that <hi>they ſparkled like the colour of burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhed braſſe,</hi> and then ſet it upon a pole, to the end that it might be ſeen from every quarter of the camp, ſo that every man that was ſtung with the fiery ſerpents might look upon this braſen ſerpent, and thereby might be healed. Now this way of cure the Lord preſcribed for two reaſons: firſt, becauſe this, being no naturall way of cure, did the better diſcover that it was of Gods mercy; and ſecondly, that it might be a type of Chriſt and our redemption by him, John 3. 14<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 15. <hi>As Moſes lifted up the ſerpent in the wilderneſſe, even ſo must the ſonne of man be lifted up; That</hi>

                  <hi>whoſoever believeth in him ſhould not periſh, but have eternall life.</hi> For firſt, as the Iſraelites were bitten with fiery ſerpents, and that biting was mortall and dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; ſo was all mankind in our parents mortally ſtung and bitten by Satan, <hi>that old ſerpent,</hi> Rev. 12. 9. ſo that their whole nature is envenomed with ſinne, as a deadly poiſon, and as it were <hi>ſet on fire of hell,</hi> as S.

Cor. 15. 56. Secondly, as the brazen ſerpent, which Moſes made for the cure of the Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elites, had the outward form of thoſe fiery ſerpents, yet had not the poyſon of thoſe ſerpents in it; ſo Chriſt came <hi>in the likeneſſe of ſinnefull fleſh,</hi> Rom. 8. 3. and yet was without ſinne: Thirdly, as the brazen ſerpent was lifted upon a pole, that when any man was ſtung with the fiery ſerpents he might lift up his eyes, and look upon it; ſo Chriſt was lifted upon the croſſe, to the end he might ſave death-ſtung ſinners; or rather, ſo was Chriſt lifted up and held forth unto men in the preaching of the Goſpel, that ſo all poore ſinners might look upon him as the onely authour of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall ſalvation, according to that of S. Paul to the Galatians, <hi>Who hath bewitched you, that you ſhould not obey the truth, before whoſe eyes Jeſus Chriſt hath been evidently ſet forth crucified among you?</hi> Gal. 3. 1. And fifthly, as the Iſraelites, that were mortally bitten by thoſe fiery ſerpents, were perfectly cured onely by looking on the brazen ſerpent, whereof there could be no naturall reaſon; ſo are ſinners per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly ſaved from that death whereto they were liable becauſe of ſinne, onely by caſting an eye of faith upon Chriſt, whereof no reaſon can be given but the will of God; and therefore is the preaching of this way of ſalvation called <hi>the fooliſhneſſe of preaching,</hi> 1.

Our Tranſlatours have noted in the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin of our Bibles, that this place cited out of that book of the warres of the Lord may be read thus, <hi>Vaheb in Saphah, and in the brooks of Arnon,</hi> &amp;c. but if it be ſo read it is hard to conjecture what was meant thereby, onely ſome Expoſitours hold that Vaheb was the name of that King of the Moabites, mentioned verſ. 26. whom Sihon conquered; and others that it was the name of a city in Saphah: but the words cited being but an imperfect clauſe, taken out of a book not now extant, no wonder it is though the meaning of them cannot be found out; ſufficient it is for us that they plainly enough prove that for which Moſes cites them, namely that the river Arnon did divide the land of the Amorites and the land of Moab.</p>

               <p>This is the argument whereby the Moabites ſought to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade the Midianites to joyn with them againſt the Iſraelites, namely, becauſe if they were let alone, they would doubtleſſe devour both them and all the neighbo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Kings 2. 24. that <hi>he turned back and looked on them, and curſed them in the name of the Lord:</hi> how effectuall curſes duly pronounced by the Prophets of God were, we may ſee in that, 2.

               <p>It is evident that Balaam was a ſorcerer, as is noted from Joſh. 13. 22. and he was likewiſe an idolater, for we ſee afterwards, chap. 23. 12. that he offered ſacrifices upon Baals high places; and how then doth he ſpeak here of the Lord Jehovah, as it is in the text, <hi>I will bring you word again as the Lord,</hi> or <hi>Jehovah, ſhall ſpeak unto me?</hi> I anſwer firſt, that it is moſt probable that ſome ſmall remainders of the knowledge of the true God were ſtill left amongſt theſe idolatrous nations, that were the poſterity of Abraham and Lot, yea and that they did make profeſſion of worſhipping the true God, though withall they worſhipped other falſe gods too: and ſo I conceive it was with Balaam, and therefore, verſ. 18. he calls God <hi>the Lord his God,</hi> and ſo though he were an idolater and a ſouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayer, yet he might pretend himſelf to be a Prophet of the Lord Jehovah too: and
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:103385:212"/>
ſecondly, this amongſt other things was a part of the magick skill of their ſouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayers in former times, that when they were by inchantments to ſeek the ruine of any people, they uſed to deal with that God who was the defender of that people, whom they called their <hi>t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>telary God:</hi> for this is clear in profane Writers, that when the Romanes intended to beſiege any city, their prieſts were wont firſt to call out that God under whoſe tutelage or protection that city was, and to promiſe him more ample place and honour among them: and thus ſome conceive that Balaam undertook to enquire of the Lord Jehovah, whom he knew to be the God of the Hebrews, to ſee whether he might be taken off from defending them. But the firſt, I conceive, is the trueſt anſwer. However, the reaſon why he deſired theſe men to ſtay all night was, becauſe in the night he uſed to have his revelations and to pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe his inchantments.</p>

               <p>Thus he ſpeaks like a mercenary prophet, loth to diſpleaſe, and deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the proffered gain: he onely makes known one part of Gods ſpeech, that he was forbidden to go with them (thereby intimating that the fault was not in him, and that if God would yield him liberty to gratifie the King, he ſhould be glad of it) whereas had he truly added the other part of Gods ſpeech, <hi>thou ſhalt not curſe the people, for they are bleſſed,</hi> this might have cut off all occaſions of farther ſending.</p>

But the order of the words is rather this, that firſt they committed bodily whoredome with the daughters of Moab (for that is principally intended, verſ. 1. and therefore S. Paul ſpeaks of this

It ſeems therefore that the Moabites, under a pretence of peace and amity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> got ſome opportunity to have their fair dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels allure ſome of the Iſraelites to uncleanneſſe, and then having intangled them in this ſinne, <hi>they called them unto the ſacrifices of their gods,</hi> that is, to the feaſts they made with their ſacrifices, and ſo they went and did eat with them, which was of it ſelf idolatry, <hi>they that eat of the ſacrifices being partakers of the altar,</hi> 1.

And all this the Moabites did by the counſel of Balaam, who knew there was no other way to endanger the Iſraelites, as it is evident chap. 31. 16. <hi>Behold,</hi> ſaith the Lord of the Midianitiſh women, <hi>theſe cauſed the children of Iſrael, through the counſel of Balaam, to commit a treſpaſſe againſt the Lord in the matter of Peor;</hi> and Rev. 2. 14. where it is ſaid that Balaam <hi>taught Balak to caſt a stumbling block before the children of Iſrael, to eat things ſacrificed to idols and to commit fornication.</hi>

But the dignity of being high prieſt ſhould have come to him and his by deſcent, may ſome ſay, becauſe he was the ſonne of Eleazar Aarons eldeſt ſonne: I anſwer, though he was ſo, yet that it ſhould not be removed to another family for want of his iſſue, that was of Gods goodneſſe, and is here promiſed as the reward of his zeal. Indeed the greateſt doubt concerning this promiſe is, whether it were continued in his poſterity or no. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning which all that we find in the Scripture is this; firſt, that we find the poſterity of this Phinehas recorded unto the time of the Iſraelites captivity in Babylon, 1. Chron. 6. 4, 15. ſecondly, that if it be true which ſome hold, that in the dayes of the Judges the high prieſts office was wreſted from the ſonnes of Phinehas, the ſonne of Eleazar, and conferred upon Eli, who was of the ſtock of Ithamar; yet in the dayes of Solomon it was again taken from Abiathar, who was of Elies houſe, and ſettled upon Zadok, and ſo it came again into the line of Phinehas, and ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued unto the Babylonian captivity, 1. Kings 2. 25. and thirdly, that though it be no where expreſſely ſaid of what ſtock the high prieſts were after the Iſraelites return out of Babylon, yet we find that Eſra that great prieſt and ſcribe was of his line, Ezra 7. 1, &amp;c. and it may be probably thought that the high prieſts ſtill continued in that line, unleſſe it were in thoſe times when there was nothing amongſt them but diſorder and confuſion. Neither indeed is there any cauſe why we ſhould under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand this promiſe to be ſo abſolute, but in caſe of the ſinnes of his poſterity they might for a time be deprived of this dignity.</p>

               <p>Of the two firſt numbrings of the people, ſee Exod. 30. 11, 12. and Numb. 1. 1, 2. But now the reaſons of this third numbring of the people, as we may gather by ſome paſſages, were theſe: firſt, becauſe this would make way to the more equall dividing of the land (which they were preſently to go about) accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as they found the tribes more or leſſe in number; ſee verſ. 53, 54. <hi>Unto theſe the land ſhall be divided for an inheritance, according to the number of names,</hi> &amp;c. ſecondly, to manifeſt how fully that which God had threatned, chap. 14. 29. was now accompliſhed, verſ. 64, 65. <hi>But among theſe there was not a man of them whom Moſes and Aaron the priest numbred, when they numbred the children of Iſrael in the wilderneſſe of Sinai.

Happely all the old company were not dead till this laſt plague, wherein foure and twenty thouſand were cut off; and therefore it may ſeem expreſſely noted, ver. 1. that it was after the plague, that God gave this charge to Moſes and Eleazar for numbring the people, becauſe then God had exactly brought that to paſſe which he had long ſince threatned, as they ſhould now ſee in taking the number of the people: thirdly, to manifeſt Gods power and goodneſſe in preſerving unto them ſo many, notwithſtanding they had wandred ſo many years through a wilderneſſe wherein they were encountred with ſo many difficulties, and had ſo often by their ſinnes provoked God to cut off many amongſt them; as alſo his truth and faithfulneſſe, who had ſo wondrouſly increaſed them, as he promiſed their forefathers, notwithſtanding they had often by their rebellion provoked him to deſtroy them: &amp; the more ſeaſonable it was to comfort them in this kind, becauſe it was immediately after foure and twenty thouſand had been taken away by the foregoing plague, chap. 25. fourthly, it was becauſe they ſhould hereby ſee Gods care over them, and love towards them; as Moſes at their coming out of Egypt received Gods flock by tale, ſo now before his death he muſt deliver them up by tale again.</p>

               <p>That is, upon all occaſions he ſhall preſent himſelf before Eleazar to ask counſel of him, who ſhall enquire of the Lord for him after the judgement of Urim. What this Urim was, ſee Exod. 28. 30. what is meant by asking counſel after the judgement of Urim, is hard to ſay. This I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive is moſt probable, when any came to enquire of the Lord, the prieſt put on the Ephod, whereto the pectorall was faſtened, in the fold whereof the Urim and Thummim was put by Moſes, and ſo the prieſt in the name of the parties propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded ſuch queſtions, as they deſired to be ſatisfied in from the Lord, deſiring the Lord to return them an anſwer (according as we find it 1. Sam. 23. 9, 10, 11, 12.) whereupon the Lord did either by the illumination of his ſpirit (whereof the Urim was an embleme or outward ſigne) reveal unto the prieſt what anſwer he ſhould give the party enquiring<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or elſe by an immediate voice from heaven; and this was called <hi>the judgement of Urim,</hi> becauſe it pleaſed the Lord, upon the applying or put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting on of the pectorall, to give judgement in the cauſe enquired of by the prieſt.</p>

But withall another thing there ſeems to be implyed in theſe words, <hi>the country which the Lord ſmote before the congregation of Iſrael,</hi> namely, that the Lord had deſtroyed the inhabitants of this countrey, that they might take it for a poſſeſſion, and that therefore it was to be eſteemed a part of the promiſed land, though it were not within Jordan; nor were they to be blamed for deſiring to have their portion there, the land being ſo fit and convenient for them. And indeed even this countrey without Jordan was the poſſeſſion of the Amorites; for Sihon was King of the Amorites, verſ<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 33. and the land of the Amorites was promiſed to Abraham, Gen. 15. 16, 21.</p>

               <p>It may be that their firſt intention was, according as theſe words imply, and as Moſes underſtood them, to deſire that they might ſtay there where they were, though afterward upon Moſes diſpleaſure they offer more equall conditions: yet I rather think that their meaning was never other, then as afterward they explained themſelves, to wit, that they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to have the land without Jordan for their inheritance, and that they might not be carried over Jordan to be ſeated there, but that they never meant to forſake their brethren till they had alſo driven out the inhabitants of Canaan; and that firſt, becauſe this conceit of ſtaying behind was ſo unjuſt, that they could not but know that it would exceedingly enrage all the other tribes againſt them; and ſecondly, becauſe in their anſwer to Moſes, verſ. 10. they diſcovered ſo preſently how farre they were from deſiring to leave their brethren, and to ſtay behind them.</p>

But becauſe there is no mention made here of any ſuch adviſing together amongſt themſelves, but rather the words ſeem to imply that they did preſently addreſſe themſelves to make this reply, we may with better ground think (as is noted before upon verſ. 5.) that they never meant any ſuch thing in their former requeſt to Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; and therefore perceiving how farre he had miſtaken their words, they now preſently replyed more fully to make known to him what it was they deſired: It is true, ſay they, we meant to leave our cattel and our children behind us (and it will be no little eaſe to us in our marching forward that we are rid of ſo great an encum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance) and to that end we purpoſe <hi>to build ſheepfolds here for our cattel, and cities for our little ones,</hi> that is, to repair and fortifie thoſe cities of the Amorites in this countrey which lie now ruinated; but for our ſelves, we purpoſe to go along with them, and never had any thought to ſtay behind.</p>

This is the full ſcope of this reply which the Reubenites and Gadites made to Moſes. Yet withall we muſt note, that though they tendred themſelves to go along with their brethren, yet their meaning was onely, that ſo many of them ſhould go as ſhould be thought requiſite for their aid againſt the inhabitants of Canaan: for we cannot think but that they meant to leave gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſons behind them for the defence of their wives and children, and for the guard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the countrey, in caſe any of the neighbouring nations ſhould invade the land when they were gone; and ſo we ſee they did, for Joſh. 4. 13. it is expreſſely ſaid, that there went of theſe tribes along over Jordan with their brethren onely about fourty thouſand armed men, whereas in the tribe of Reuben alone there was above fourty thouſand fighting men, chap. 26. 7.</p>

               <p>Three arguments there are couched in theſe words whereby Moſes is to perſwade the Iſraelites not to wrong their brethren the Edomites in the leaſt thing whatſoever; firſt, becauſe the Lord had bleſſed them, that is, he had proſpered them ſo that they were able to pay for that which they had occaſion to deſire of them: ſecondly, becauſe the Lords eye was upon them to take care of them in their travels through the wilderneſſe (for that is the meaning of thoſe words, <hi>He knoweth thy walking through this great wilderneſſe)</hi> ſo that having God to watch over them, they need not ſeek to ſupply themſelves in an unlawfull way: and thirdly, becauſe they had found this true already for fourty years together, and therefore might the more ſecurely reſt upon God, <hi>Theſe fourty years the Lord thy God hath been with thee, thou hast lacked nothing.</hi>

Indeed ſome couceive that they onely allowed them a paſſage through their countrey, but refuſed them proviſion, which they ground upon that place, Deut. 23. 3, 4. But I rather think the meaning of that place is, that they did not come forth to meet the Iſraelites with bread and water, as thoſe uſe to do that wiſh good ſucceſſe, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in the welfare of the people to whom they bring it; for this they might fail in, and yet the people might ſell them proviſion as they went along: and therefore for any thing we reade elſewhere it may well be that the Moabites did alſo ſuffer the Iſraelites to paſſe through the skirts of their countrey, and did ſell them meat and water for their money; though it is true indeed that afterwards, when the Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites had deſtroyed Sihon and Og, and their people, fearing leſt they ſhould do the ſame to them, becauſe the land of the Moabites bordered upon theſe countreys, they together with the Midianites aſſayed both by open violence and ſecret treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to do them all the miſchief they were able, Numb. 22. 1, &amp;c.</p>

               <p>There are two arguments included in theſe words, whereby Moſes diſſwades them from going a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whoring after other Gods: firſt, becauſe their God was jealous of having this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour given to any but himſelf, concerning which ſee the note upon chap. 4. 24. and ſecondly, becauſe their God was ever amongſt them (as being every where preſent) obſerving all their wayes, and therefore their idolatries could not be hidden from him.</p>

               <p>Men are ſaid <hi>to tempt God,</hi> when they will not reſt in that truth concerning God revealed in his word, but will needleſſely make experiments whether he be ſo juſt, wiſe, faithfull, &amp;c. as in his word he is ſaid to be: which may be done, firſt, by wilfull ſinning, as it were trying whether he be omniſcient, &amp;c. Act. 5. 3. ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, by needleſſe ruſhing upon any danger without a calling, Mat. 4. 6, 7. thirdly, by requiring a ſigne needleſſely, and out of a falſe diſſembling heart, onely to ſee whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſuch a miracle can be wrought or no, Mat. 16. 1. Luke 11. 16. fourthly, by preſcribing God when and how he ſhall perform his promiſes, which limiting of God proceeds from infidelity; and thus they tempted God in Maſſah. See Pſalm. 78. 41.</p>

Neither yet is it the purpoſe of Moſes that the Iſraelites ſhould look to be exactly righteous by the exact fulfilling of the Law; but the Law is onely here uſed as a ſchool-maſter to bring them unto Chriſt, Gal. 3. 24. Moſes propounding to them this righteouſneſſe of the Law, that they, finding how impoſſible it was for them to attain this righteouſneſſe of the Law, might thereby be brought to ſeek after that righteouſneſſe which is by faith; and withall to let them know that though the Lord was pleaſed to make a covenant of grace with them, and to receive them as juſtified in and through the righteouſneſſe of a Mediatour, yet there was alſo a perſonall inherent righteouſneſſe required of

               <p>The meaning of this is, that God brought them to want bread, and then ſupplyed that want with manna from heaven, that he might thereby teach them, that though God had appointed bread and ſuch like food to be the ordinary means of ſuſtaining mans life, yet it was not that alone that did ſuſtain men, but the word, that is, the decree and command of God: in ſo much that as bread cannot nouriſh us except God commands a bleſſing on it, ſo on the other ſide he can command any thing elſe to nouriſh us as well as bread, as they had ſeen in the manna where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with God had ſed them many years; yea he can keep men alive without food a long time together, as he did Moſes, Elijah, and our Saviour Chriſt, whereupon he retorted this place of Scrip<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Theſe are two other miraculous effects of Gods provident care over them, by the mention whereof Moſes ſtirres them up to the obeying of Gods Laws. The firſt is, that their garments were not the worſe for wearing, at leaſt they grew not threadbare or torn in fourty years wearing, concerning which this is alſo par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly added, Deut. 29. 5. that <hi>their ſhoes</hi> (which were moſt likely to wear out with their continuall travelling) <hi>did not wax old upon their feet.</hi> To make this good there are ſome Expoſitours do adde concerning thoſe that were young when they came out of Egypt, that their garments did miraculouſly grow as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="3 letters">

But there is no neceſſity of forging thus more miracles then are expreſſed, and that becauſe thoſe that out-grew their garments might be ſupplyed with the garments of ſuch as died in the wilderneſſe, and then the garments they left off might ſerve thoſe that grew to their ſtature. The ſecond is, that <hi>their feet did not ſwell,</hi> notwithſtanding their continuall travels, &amp; that becauſe their ſho es waxt not old<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> under which alſo ſome think is included the health of their bodies in generall (unleſſe in caſe when they were extraordinarily ſtricken with ſickneſſe becauſe of ſome rebellion againſt God) to which they apply that of the Pſalmiſt, <hi>there was not one feeble perſon among their tribes,</hi> Pſal. 105. 37.</p>

<pb n="471" facs="tcp:103385:245"/>
that the time was now come that ere long they were to paſſe over Jordan, and to enter the land of Canaan; for in the Scripture <hi>day</hi> is often uſed for time, as 2. Cor. 6. 2. <hi>Now is the accepted time, now is the day of ſalvation:</hi> ſecondly, that by <hi>poſſeſſing nations greater and mightier then themſelves</hi> is meant the poſſeſſing of the land of thoſe nations: and thirdly, Moſes here puts them in mind of the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull ſtrength of the inhabitants, purpoſely to prevent all thoughts of vanquiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them by their own ſtrength, and that when they had overcome them they might be ſure to aſcribe all the glory to God; as is evident by the inference he makes upon this, verſ. 3. <hi>Understand therefore this day that the Lord thy God is he which goeth before thee as a conſuming fire,</hi> that is, know therefore by this which hath been ſaid of the exceeding ſtrength of this people that it were not poſſible that you ſhould ſo ſuddenly deſtroy ſo many potent nations, if there were not a power above that of mans imployed in the work, and that Gods hand is as evident herein as if a conſuming fire ſhould go before you to burn them up.</p>

               <p>In this and the following verſe there are many difficulties, and ſuch as indeed (the words being read as they are in our tranſlati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) are almoſt inextricable: yet we muſt ſee what may be ſaid for the anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them. The firſt difficulty is in the connexion of theſe words with that which went before, to wit, how Moſes, being in this chapter ſpeaking of thoſe things that befell them at mount Sinai, comes here to mention the journeys of the Iſraelites in places to which they came not a long time after they had been at mount Sinai, as is evident, Numb. 33. 31, 32. But this it is not ſo hard to reſolve: for we muſt know that theſe two verſes are not added here as in order of Hiſtory, but are onely inſerted by the way as in a parentheſis, ſo that the meaning of Moſes is not that Beeroth of the children of Jaakan here mentioned was the next place where they pitched their tents after they removed from mount Sinai (for as we may ſee, Numb. 33. mount Sinai was but the twelveth ſtation of the children of Iſrael, &amp; Beeroth of the children of Jaakan or Bene-jaakan, as it is called, Numb. 33. 31. was the twenty eighth ſtation) but his meaning is onely that having gon many journeys forward and backward, as the Lord commanded them, at length they went from Beeroth of the children of Jaakan to Moſera or Moſeroth, as it is written, Numb. 33. 30. The ſecond difficultie is concerning the place of Aarons death, to wit, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Numb. 33. 38. it is ſaid Aaron died at mount Hor, and here that he dyed at Moſera, and Moſera in that 33. of Numbers is but the twenty ſeventh ſtation of the Iſraelites, and that as they went back from Kadeſh-Barnea towards the red ſea, and mount Hor is their thirtie fourth ſtation, and that as they returned again from the red ſea towards the land of Canaan. But to this I anſwer that this Moſera or Moſeroth and mount Hor were but one mountain in the root, though divided into
<pb n="474" facs="tcp:103385:247"/>
divers tops, as mount Sinai and Horeb were, by the Weſt part whereof, called Moſeroth, Moſes encamped as he went back towards the red ſea, and by the Eaſt part thereof, called mount Hor, as he returned again Northward towards the land of Canaan; and ſo though Aaron dyed at mount Hor, yet here it is ſaid of Moſera that <hi>there Aaron, dyed and there he was buried,</hi> and that becauſe Moſera and mount Hor were both one and the ſame mountain. The third and greateſt difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie is in the ſeeming contradiction that is betwixt this place, and that, Numb. 33. 31. in that here it is ſaid that the Iſraelites went from Bene-jaakan or Beeroth of the children of Jaakan to Moſera, &amp; ſo to Gudgodah, and to Jotbath<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp; yet there, quite contrary in one particular, it is ſaid that they went from Moſera or Moſeroth to Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne-jaakan, &amp; ſo from thence to Gudgodah, or Horhagidgad, as it is there called, and from thence to Jotbathah, or Jotbath, as it is here written. To anſwer this, ſome Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitours ſay that the places here named are not the ſame that are mentioned, Num. 33. 31. 32, 33. But becauſe all the foure places here named together are mentioned alſo together there, and that with ſo little variation of the names as Moſera for Moſeroth, and Gudgodah for Horhagidgad, and Jotbath for Jotbathah, and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne-jaakan for Beeroth or the wells of the children of Jaakan, it is very hard to think that Moſes in theſe two places ſpeaks not of the ſame journeys of the Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites.

               <p>This phraſe of ſetting before them the bleſſing and the curſe was purpoſely uſed, no doubt, to intimate that they might take their choice of either of theſe; and ſo to manifeſt that if the curſe came upon them they cauſed it themſelves, and could blame no body but themſelves onely.</p>

               <p>That is, thou ſhalt cauſe the bleſſings, which the Lord hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to them that keep his laws, to be pronounced on mount Gerizim, and the curſes, which the Lord hath threatned to them that break his laws, to be pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced on mount Ebal, and ſo ſhalt make thoſe mountains to be as it were continuall remembrancers to the people of the bleſſing and the curſe, that when they ſee mount Gerizim they may ſee the bleſſing ſet before them, and ſo likewiſe the curſe, when they ſee mount Ebal. This is afterward enjoyned again, Deut. 27. 11. 12. &amp;c. where it is alſo more fully expreſſed how it was to be done; and Joſh. 8. 33. we may ſee how this which God here enjoyned was accordingly done. And it ſeems that from this very commandment given to Moſes concerning mount Gerizim, the Samaritans, many ages after this, took occaſion to build a temple there, as taking Gerizim to be a bleſſed place, becauſe the bleſſings were pronounced on it: for that the Samaritans temple was built upon mount Gerizim is the common opinion of moſt Writers; and we may find it very probable by comparing together John 4. 3, 20. with Judg. 9. 7. ſince there, to wit Judg. 9. 7. it is evident that mount Gerizim was nigh unto Shechem, becauſe from the top of mount Gerizim Jotham ſpake to the men of Shechem that were gathered together, and had made Abimelech their King, and by that which is ſaid of the woman of Samaria, John 4. it is as evident that the Samaritans temple was built on a mountain nigh unto Shechem; becauſe that Samaritan woman dwelling at Sychar, which was Shechem (as appears by the words that follow, John 4. 5. where it is noted that this Sychar was <hi>near by the parcell of ground which Jacob gave to his ſonne Joſeph,</hi> and that was certainly at Shechem, as is noted upon Gen. 33. 19. and 48. 22.) ſpeaks of the Samaritans temple as of a place that was hard by<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and perhaps in their view, John 4. 20. <hi>Our fathers worſhipped in this mountain, &amp; ye ſay that in Jeruſalem is the place where men ought to worſhip.</hi>

               <p>Theſe words are added as the reaſon why they were not to hearken to any Prophet that ſhould perſwade them to idolatry, yea though he gave them any ſigne or wonder which ſhould ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly come to paſſe, to wit, becauſe hereby the Lord did prove them, to ſee whether they did ſincerely love God or no. For the underſtanding whereof we muſt know the Lord is here ſaid <hi>to prove them</hi> by that which the falſe Prophets did to ſeduce them to idolatry, firſt, becauſe even the Lord himſelf may by the Spirit of prophecy reveal things to come even to wicked men and falſe Prophets, as he did to Balaam and Caiaphas, as knowing how thereby to bring glory to himſelf, though they onely intend to corrupt and ſeduce his people; ſecondly, becauſe though theſe predictions given, and wonders wrought are uſually either mere forgings and impoſtures, or elſe ſatanicall deluſions, whereby men are made to think they ſee thoſe things done which indeed are not done, or laſtly, are ſuch wonders as are indeed done, but by the power of the devil, yet it is of God that either men or devils are permitted to do ſuch things, who could eaſily reſtrain them if he ſaw cauſe to do it; and thirdly, becauſe the Lords aim, in ſuffering the devil and wicked men thus to abuſe men, is to make tryall, that is, by this tryall to make it known, whether they love the Lord their God with all their heart and with all their ſoul, this being a ſure rule, that thoſe whoſe hearts are upright towards God will not be drawn a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from the truth of God by ſuch deluſions, according to that of the Apoſtle, 1.

               <p>Here they are enjoyned to put the falſe Prophet to death that ſhall ſo ſeduce the people: for the better underſtanding whereof we muſt note, firſt, that every ſpreading of falſe doctrines in matters of leſſe conſequence was not thus to be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, but onely the ſeducing of men from the true religion to the direct worſhip of falſe Gods; and in this caſe, though many Expoſitours hold that this Law con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned onely the policie of the Jews, yet I ſee not but that it gives the Chriſtian Magiſtrate power alſo to provide for the ſecuring of his people, even by the capitall puniſhment of thoſe that ſeduce them to an apoſtacy of ſo high a nature; ſecondly,
<pb n="485" facs="tcp:103385:252"/>
that in the reaſon here rendred why they ſhould put ſuch falſe prophets to death, the phraſe that is uſed, <hi>becauſe he had ſpoken—to thrust thee out of the way which the Lord thy God commanded thee to walk in,</hi> is intended to imply what a dangerous and ſtrong temptation that of pretended miracles is to ſeduce men from the way of truth; and therefore our Saviour alſo ſpeaking of ſuch, ſaid, Mat. 24. 24. <hi>They ſhall deceive (if it were poſſible) the very elect:</hi> and thirdly, that the laſt clauſe, <hi>ſo ſhalt thou put the evil away from the midst of thee,</hi> is meant both of the evil men that were the ſeducers, and the hurt which they might have done, to wit, that by cutting off theſe evil men the hurt which they might do amongſt the people ſhould be prevented.</p>

                  <bibl>Verſ. 6.</bibl> If thy brother, the ſonne of thy mother, &amp;c.]</q>
               <p>The drift of this place is to let them know, that not onely falſe prophets (of whom he had ſpoken in the former verſes) but all others whatſoever were to be put to death that ſhould ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce them to idolatry, not openly but ſecretly, and that they were not to ſpare thoſe that were deareſt to them, &amp;c. And for the fuller clearing of this, we may note, firſt, that this phraſe, <hi>If thy brother the ſonne of thy mother,</hi> is here uſed, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to diſtinguiſh true brothers from kindred, yea from all other Iſraelites, who are frequently in the Scripture called <hi>their brethren;</hi> or elſe emphatically to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe that brother that is uſually moſt beloved, to wit, a brother both by father and mother, at leaſt a brother by the mothers ſide, that lay in the ſame belly with them, and that becauſe our love to ſuch is naturally the ſtrongeſt: and ſecondly, that in the particular mention that is here made of the daughter, as well as of the ſonne, as alſo of the wife, there is not onely reſpect had to the love that men bear to them, but alſo to the pity that men are prone to take of that ſex: men are natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally enclined to take compaſſion of that ſex; and therefore this is particularly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, that in caſe a daughter or wife ſeek to ſeduce them to idolatry, they muſt be put to death, and there muſt be no pity ſhown them becauſe of their ſex. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed becauſe there is no mention made here of father and mother, therefore ſome have thought that by this Law the child was not bound to accuſe either father or mother, if they ſought to ſeduce him to idolatry, the Lord not enjoyning this in regard it was ſo much againſt the reverence which children do naturally bear to their parents. But theſe build upon too weak a ground: Doubtleſſe in Gods cauſe there is no more reaſon for the child to regard the parents, then for the husband to regard the wife of his boſome, and Levi in this caſe is commended for cloſing his eyes againſt his parents, becauſe <hi>he ſaid unto his father and to his mother, I have not ſeen him,</hi> chap. 33. 9. and therefore queſtionleſſe under theſe that are named all other perſons that are moſt dear to men, even parents alſo, are comprehended.</p>

                  </gap>e two before mentioned, verſ. 22, and 23. For 1. this was onely paid every third year, to wit, each third year after the Sabbaticall year, when the land lay at reſt, and ſo there was then no tithe paid at all, but all things were common, Exod. 23. 10, 11. And 2. this was for another ſervice: the firſt of thoſe tithes mentioned before were wholly the Levites portion, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore often called, <hi>the Lords inheritance,</hi> and the ſecond or the price of them was carried up by the owners to the Lords dwelling place, and ſpent in holy feaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before the Lord, but this now was laid up in ſome publick place in the towns and cities where they dwelt, and was not onely for the uſe of the Levites, but alſo for <hi>the ſtranger, the fatherleſſe, and the widow,</hi> &amp;c. as is expreſſed here, verſ. 29. So that it ſeems whereas the two firſt years after the Sabbaticall year there were two tithes onely ſeparated from their eſtates, the firſt for the Levites, the ſecond to be ſpent in holy feaſting before the Lord, on the third year they ſeparated a third tithe, which was for the poore in the places where they dwelt; and ſo again the two next years they ſeparated onely the two firſt tithes, and then on the third year three tithes again, and ſo then the next year was again the Sabbaticall year. I know there are many Expoſitours hold that the tithe here mentioned, which was <hi>at the end of three years</hi> laid up for the poore, was the very ſame tithe which the two years before the owners ſpent in holy feaſting: the third year, they ſay, this ſecond tithe was not carried up to Jeruſalem to be ſpent in their holy feaſts there, but it was laid up at home for the uſe of the poore. But two arguments may be brought againſt this o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion from a following paſſage concerning the third years tithes, chap. 26. 12. which cannot well be anſwered. The firſt is, that this third year is there called <hi>the year of tithing,</hi> there being no probable reaſon that can be given why that year ſhould be called peculiarly <hi>the year of tithing,</hi> but onely this, becauſe that year they ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated three tithes from their eſtates, one more then on other years: If the tithes on this third year laid up for the poore were the ſame which the two former years they had ſpent in holy feaſting, then did they ſeparate no more tithes this third year then on other years; and vvhy then ſhould it be called <hi>the year of tithing?</hi> The ſecond argument is, that on this third year every man vvas to go up to Jeruſalem, and there to make a ſolemn pro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The greateſt difficulty concerning theſe words is, what this releaſe was, which is expreſſed in the following verſe thus, <hi>every creditour that lendeth ought unto his neighbour ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſe it, he ſhall not exact it of his neighbour, or of his brother,</hi> that is, of any Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lite whatſoever, <hi>becauſe it is called the Lords releaſe,</hi> that is, becauſe the Lord hath ordained it to be a year of releaſe. Some Expoſitours hold that the releaſe here en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned was an abſolute acquitting and diſcharging of the debt for ever; onely they adde that they were bound thus to forgive the debts of the poore onely, and that therefore it is added, verſ. 4. <hi>ſave when there ſhall be no poore among you,</hi> intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting that of the rich they might require what was owing them.

And indeed becauſe the Hebrew word, here tranſlated <hi>a releaſe of debts,</hi> may be rendred <hi>a remiſſion,</hi> or, <hi>intermiſsion,</hi> and is the ſame that is elſewhere uſed, to wit, Exod. 23. 11. where ſpeech is of the land that it ſhould be let reſt or intermitted from tillage, that being onely for the ſeventh year, it cannot be gathered from this word that they were to give an abſolute re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſe of their debts for ever, but onely that they were not to exact them this ſeventh year, and that becauſe there was neither ſowing nor reaping nor other works of husbandry that year, and ſo the poore had not ſuch means to pay their debts as in other years. However as in regard of the Sabbath-reſt of this year (of which ſee the note upon Exod. 23. 11.) ſo alſo in regard of this releaſe of debts at that time, this year was a figure or type of that acceptable year of grace, which brought us a releaſe of our ſinne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The Lord here gives them two rules, to which they ſhould be bound when ever they ſhould deſire to have a King to reigne over them: The firſt is, That they ſhould onely make ſuch a one king as God ſhould chooſe; which was accordingly obſerved partly in Saul, but fully in David, and in his progeny too, in that it was of Gods ordaining that his poſterity ſhould ſucceſſively inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit the kingdome: and this was thus appointed, becauſe the Kings of Judah were to be types of Chriſt; who was choſen of God to be the great King of Iſrael, Pſal. 2. 6. <hi>I have ſet my King upon my holy hill of Sion.</hi> The ſecond is, That they might onely chooſe one from amongſt their brethren to be their King: and this was, firſt, becauſe ſuch a one was likelieſt to love them, and to be beloved by them, and to rule over them with the more equity and gentleneſſe; and ſecondly, leſt a ſtranger of another nation ſhould bring in ſtrange Laws and cuſtomes, yea and corrupt their religion too; and thirdly, to ſignifie that their promiſed Meſſiah, the Lords An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ointed, was to be the ſeed of Abraham according to the fleſh, even one of their own nation.</p>

               <p>That is, exceſſively, even beyond that which reaſonably the ſtate of a King may require: and this the Lord gives in charge concerning the Kings of Iſrael, firſt, to teach both the King and the people to put their ſole truſt and confidence in God, and not to rely on any outward ſtrength of horſes and chariots, which men having abundance of ſuch mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary forces are prone to do; ſecondly, that they might not hereby be exalted and puffed up in their minds, even to the deſpiſing and perhaps the oppreſſing of their brethren; and thirdly, that they might not, to maintain the exceſſive charge hereof, be burdenſome to their ſubjects: &amp; herein therefore we may well think that Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon did not keep ſo cloſe to the rule of Gods word as he ought to have done, in that he had fourty thouſand ſtalls of horſes for his chariots, and twelve thouſand horſemen, 1. Kings. 4. 26. as likewiſe in that he fetcht his horſes out of Egypt, 2.

               <p>That is, too too exceſſively.

But neither of theſe I conceive can be meant here, becauſe this place ſpeaks not of ſuch things as were the patrimony of the Prieſts and Levites in generall, but of that mans peculiar patrimony which ſhould thus volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily go up to ſerve at the altar; which therefore doubtleſſe was ſuch moneys as came in of the ſale either of thoſe houſes which were his portion and patrimony in the cities of the Levites, or of any other eſtate that was left him by his father: and ſo the meaning of this place is, that notwithſtanding any ſuch private eſtate that the Levite had, yet if he went up to ſerve in the temple he muſt live of the holy things of the temple, as others did. Indeed conſidering that the Levite might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem his houſe, which he had ſold, at any time, Levit. 25. 32. it was not fit that he ſhould be diſabled to do this by ſpending his money upon his own maintenance. But however if of ſingular devotion to the ſervice of the Sanctuary he ſhould go up extraordinarily to ſerve there, God would have ſuch an one live of the altar and not be put thereby to ſpend his own private eſtate whatever it were.</p>

               <p>The heathens, that uſed theſe unlawfull arts, made account that God did by theſe means reveal himſelf to them, and deemed ſuch high knowledge a high degree of their happineſſe: leſt therefore the Iſraelites ſhould think much that they were debarred of this, the Lord tells them here that he would by prophets raiſed up to them from amongſt their brethren as fully inform them concerning all things neceſſary for them to know, as if God ſhould come down to them out of heaven. I doubt not indeed but this which is here ſpoken is meant firſt and principally of Chriſt; for the Apoſtle Peter ſaith expreſſely that this was fulfilled in Chriſt, Acts 3. 22. <hi>For Moſes truly ſaid unto the fathers, A Prophet ſhall the Lord your God raiſe up unto you, of your brethren like unto me; him ſhall ye hear in all things whatſoever he ſhall ſay unto you;</hi> and with reſpect to this place that ſeems <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>It is queſtioned by Expoſitours of what inlarging their coaſts this is meant: and becauſe it is ſaid, chap. 7. 22. that they ſhould not drive out the inhabitants of the land of Canaan at once, but by little and little, therefore ſome underſtand this of their full poſſeſſing of the land of Canaan, to wit, that however they did at firſt onely ſet apart three cities of refuge in the land within Jordan, yet if afterwards they came to poſſeſſe the whole land of Canaan, they ſhould then ſeparate three cities of refuge more therein. But firſt, becauſe they never did ſeparate ſix cities of refuge more within Jordan, no not when they had the fulleſt poſſeſſion of the land; and ſecondly, becauſe thoſe three cities that were ſeparated within the land, to wit, Kedeſh, and Shechem, and Hebron, were ſituated in equall diviſions proportionably according to the full extent of the land of Canaan, therefore it is no way probable that God ever enjoyned them to have ſix cities of refuge in the land of Canaan within Jordan. Others again think that in theſe words, Moſes ſpeaks onely of three cities more that were to be added beſides thoſe three without Jordan, to wit, thoſe three above mentioned which Joſhua ſeparated, Joſh. 20. 7. and ſo conceive that no other inlarging of their coaſts is here meant, but onely the adding of the land of Canaan to that they had already<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> gotten without Jordan.

                  </gap>on here given for this law is, that the fruit of their ſeed ſowen and the fruit of their vines might not be mingled together, and ſo be defiled, it is worth our conſidering whether this be not meant rather of the ſeed of fruit-trees then of corn and herbs, the fruit whereof was not likely to be mingled with that of the vine: and thus as in that law, Levit. 19. 19. the ſowing of ſeverall kinds of grain in one field was forbidden, ſo here the ſowing of the ſeed of other fruit-trees together with the vine. As for the reaſon here annexed to this law, <hi>lest the fruit of thy ſeed which thou haſt ſown, and the fruit of thy vineyard, be defiled,</hi> ſome underſtand it thus, leſt the fruit of their ſeed and their vineyard be corrupred and marred, to wit, becauſe whileſt the heart of the earth is ſucked away by too many things ſown or planted in it, neither of them can be good and fair, as they would otherwiſe be, but both are ſpoyled and good for nothing: and thus, they ſay, the Iſraelites were taught to take heed of a covetous and greedy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to draw more from the earth then it is well able to bear. But it is better by others underſtood of their being defiled by being mingled together: for as that is ſaid to be pure which is not mixed, as that we call pure wheat, which is not mixed with any other grain; ſo that may be ſaid to be defiled which is mingled, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally being done contrary to Gods law, and ſo rendered unlawfull either in firſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fruits or otherwiſe to be offered to the Lord.</p>

And indeed thus to underſtand this phraſe, <hi>of not entring into the congregation of the Lord,</hi> we may be the rather induced, becauſe Nehem. 13. 1, 2, 3. it is ſaid, that when the Jews heard this law read out of the book of Moſes, that <hi>the Ammonite and the Moabite ſhould not come into the congregation of God for ever, they ſeparated from Iſrael all the mixed multitude,</hi> which ſeems plainly to be meant of their ſeparating them from being numbered amongſt Gods people, and from en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying the priviledges of freeborn Iſraelites, <hi>Hebrews of the Hebrews,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſpeaks of himſelf, Phil. 3. 5.

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rizzim) and then all the tribes that ſtood on mount Gerizzim anſwered <hi>Amen,</hi> and then turning again to mount Ebal they pronounced the twelve curſes, that are after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ſet down in the latter end of this chapter, and then all the tribes that ſtood on mount Ebal anſwered <hi>Amen.</hi> Indeed in Joſh. 8. 33. it is not ſaid that the tribes ſtood upon mount Gerizzim and upon mount Ebal, but that they ſtood <hi>half of them over againſt mount Gerizzim, and half of them over a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt mount Ebal:</hi> But hereby one and the ſame thing is meant, onely it is ſo expreſſed in Joſhua, either to intimate that th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

right oppoſite againſt the other, or elſe rather becauſe the people, at leaſt their rulers and officers, ſtood on the firſt aſcending of the hills, and ſo indeed ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther over againſt them then upon them. Beſides, though there is no mention made here of the prieſts pronouncing the bleſſings, but onely the curſes, yet in Joſhua 8. 33. it is expreſſely ſaid that Joſhua read (that is, the prieſts by Joſhuas appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) <hi>the bleſſings and the curſes:</hi> and therefore doubtleſſe the bleſſings were read by the prieſts as well as the curſes, onely Moſes paſſeth over the bleſſings, either be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they might be eaſily enough gathered from the contrary curſes which are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, or elſe (as ſome conceive) by this his ſilence in not mentioning the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings, to lead his prudent reader to look for the bleſſings by another, which is Chriſt, Acts 3. 26. <hi>God having raiſed up his ſonne Jeſus, ſent him to bleſſe you in turning every one of you away from his iniquities:</hi> for ſilence in the holy ſtorie of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten implieth great myſteries, as the Apoſtle ſheweth from Moſes ſilence concerning Melchiſedecs parents, Heb. 7. 3, &amp;c. As for the reaſons why the Lord would have the people in ſuch a ſolemn manner to give aſſent to theſe bleſſings and curſes thus pronounced in their hearing, we may probably conceive it was, firſt, to teach them hereby that the law of God was juſt, the ſinner himſelf being judge, and that he who breaks them muſt needs be ſelf-condemned even by the light of a naturall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience; and ſecondly, the better to reſtrain them from breaking theſe laws, where there was no danger of being puniſhed by the Magiſtrate, by putting them in mind that theſe ſinnes would however expoſe them to Gods curſe. And indeed the rather may we think that this God intended in this ſolemn ſervice, becauſe moſt of the ſinnes here particularly accurſed are ſecret ſinnes, as ſecret idolatrie, verſ. 15. the ſecret removing of the land-mark, verſ. 17. inceſt, and beſtialitie, and ſuch other ſinnes as men are uſuall to conceal. Some adde beſides, that mount Gerizzim being on the right hand of the prieſts, and mount Ebal on the left, hereby that day was ſhadowed forth, when a bleſſing ſhall be pronounced on them at the right hand, and a curſe upon them at the left. But whether there was any ground for this myſterie, I queſtion much: What is fit to be further obſerved concerning this paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, we may ſee in the foregoing note upon chap. 11. 29.</p>

It is true indeed that when the Jews, after the deſtruction of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem, were ſold for ſlaves by the Romans, though many of them were then car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried away by ſhipping into Egypt (and ſo that was then accompliſhed which is here threatned) yet it might be well enough ſaid that they were brought back into Egypt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

But I ſay there is no neceſſity that we ſhould underſtand this preciſely of their being carried into Egypt by the way they went out from thence: That which is here threatned is onely this, that God would bring them to be ſlaves again in Egypt; and we need not wonder that this is threatned in the laſt place, as a moſt remarkable judgement, if we conſider how terrible the very name of Egypt muſt needs be to them in regard of thoſe grievous miſeries their fathers had already indured there; and that Gods undoing of that which he had done, and bringing them back to that bondage from which he had reſcued them, when he at firſt took them to be his peculiar people, was a kind of diſcharging them from being any longer his people, as if he had quit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The more miraculouſly God had preſerved them, the more evident was Gods care over them, and the more reaſon they had to be circumſpectly carefull of yielding obedience to all his commandments; and therefore it is that Moſes puts them in mind how the Lord had ſuſtained them without bread, or wine, and ſtrong drink, feeding them with manna from heaven in ſtead of bread; and doubtleſſe ordinarily they had no other bread, though at ſometimes they might; of which ſee the note, Deut. 2. 6.</p>

Some ſay that this is not unfitly ſubjoyned to the foregoing exhortation for obſerving carefully the laws of God, becauſe it diſcovers, and ſo gives us a hint to take heed of an ordinary root of diſobedience, to wit, when men are ambitious to know and buſily ſearch after Gods ſecret counſels, which they have nothing to do with, and by that means are taken off from minding thoſe revealed duties which do ſo nearly concern them. But I rather conceive that this clauſe is here inſerted, either by way of explaining what he had formerly delivered, to wit, that he ſaid not that they ſhould certainly be thus deſtroyed, as is before mentioned; No, whether your poſterity (ſaith he) will by their rebellion thus provoke God, and ſo bring this heavy indignation upon the land, that is onely known to God, <hi>

               <p>One main reaſon of calling this aſſembly was that Moſes might in a ſolemn manner ſubſtitute Joſhua to ſucceed in his room: and accordingly in the firſt place he addreſſeth his ſpeech to perſwade the people not to be troubled at this change; for though the people had often murmured and rebelled againſt Moſes, yet being at length brought by him to the borders of the land of Canaan, and having had ſuch good experience of his faithfulneſſe in governing, it could not but be an occaſion of much grief and fear to be deprived now of him, to loſe him juſt now when they were entring the land; and therefore he ſeeks now to comfort them and to prevent their exceſſive ſorrow, and that firſt by putting them in mind of his years, not that he was already by reaſon of his years unfit for this weightie office, Deut. 34. 7. but that by the courſe of nature they might well ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect he muſt now grow weak, and decay, and wax unfit for ſuch great labours, though God had hitherto miraculouſly preſerved him.

                  <hi>Elders of Iſrael,</hi> even thereby to give them to underſtand that they were the men to whoſe charge it did eſpecially appertain to ſee that this originall book of the law were ſafely kept, and that the laws contained therein were duly obſerved, both by them and by the people. The prieſts were to teach the people the knowledge of this law, and to them it did belong to uphold and maintain his truth and will therein revealed, that it might not be overborn or troden under ſoot by any poſſeſſed with a ſpirit of errour and profaneneſſe; and therefore was the law delivered to them: and the Elders, they were to aſſiſt the prieſts and the Levites, and to ſee that the people regarded them in their places, and withall to ſee that the judiciall laws were executed: and therefore to them alſo the law was delivered. As for the deſcription of the prieſts, <hi>the ſonnes of Levi which bare the ark of the covenant of the Lord,</hi> it may alſo be added to imply another reaſon why the book of the law was given to them, namely, becauſe they were to lay up this book in the ſide of the ark, verſ. 26. And though the Levites did uſually bear the ark, Numb. 3. 31. and 4. 15. yet ſometimes, eſpecially upon extraordinary occaſions, the prieſts alſo carried it, as when they paſſed over Jordan, Joſh. 3. 16, 17. and when they compaſſed Jericho, Joſh. 6. 12. and they had alwayes the chief charge to look to the ark and the other holy things.</p>
               <q>And Moſes commanded them, ſaying. At the end of every ſeven years, &amp;c.]</q>
               <p>The ſumme of this paſſage is briefly this, that Moſes commanded the prieſts to read this book of the law every ſeventh year, which was the year of releaſe, amongſt the people, and that upon the feaſt of tabernacles that year. Concerning the year of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſe, and the phraſe here uſed, <hi>At the end of every ſeven years,</hi> ſee the note upon chap. 15. 1. But beſides for the fuller underſtanding of this paſſage we muſt note, firſt, That the law, which the prieſts were here enjoyned to reade amongſt the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple every ſeventh year on the feaſt of tabernacles, was the originall copie of this book of the law which Moſes wrote, and which he now delivered to the prieſts to be kept by them. Doubtleſſe ſome part of the book of the law was read amongſt them by the Levites every Sabbath day, Acts 15. 21. <hi>For Moſes of old time hath in every city them that preach him, being read in the Synagogues every Sabbath day;</hi> nor can it be queſtioned but that the people had books of the law, in the read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whereo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> they did dayly in private exerciſe themſelves: if this were required of their kings, chap. 17. 18, 19. much more may we think it was required of them that were of inforiour rank. But yet once in ſeven years God would have this book to be read by the prieſts, from the beginning to the end, amongſt the people, both that being read in ſuch a ſolemn manner it might take the deeper impreſſion in them, and ſo cauſe them <hi>to fear the Lord their God, and to obſerve to do all the words of this law,</hi> as it follows, verſ. 12. and perhaps alſo that it might be made manifeſt to all Iſrael that thoſe copies of the law which they had, and which were read and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded to them every Sabbath day, did agree with this originall which Moſes wrote: and ſecondly, that the reaſon why God appointed this to be done on the year of releaſe, was not onely becauſe that year they had moſt liberty of mind to intend that ſervice, the l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

year, the Sabbath of years, and ſo the fitter for this extraordinary duty: and third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that this was appointed to be done at the feaſt of tabernacles that year, becauſe then <hi>all Iſrael came to appear before the Lord,</hi> as it is ſaid, verſ. 11. for though the males onely were bound to come up at the feaſt, Exod. 23. 17. yet they did uſually carry with them their women alſo, and therefore it is ſaid, verſ. 12. <hi>Gather the people together, men and women and children, &amp;c. that they may hear, and that they may learn,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

<pb n="547" facs="tcp:103385:284"/>
to ſignifie that it was the law of God, though written by Moſes, and ſo the people might heare it with the more reverence and attention when it was brought forth thence and read amongſt them; and withall, that God would keep and preſerve it, and take vengeance on thoſe that ſhould diſregard and diſpiſe it. Indeed this was that very book which was found in the treaſurie of the temple in Joſiahs time, 2.

               <p>Some Expoſitours by <hi>publiſhing the name of the Lord,</hi> underſtand his ſetting forth the excellencies of God, to wit, his infinite power, wiſdome, righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, &amp;c. and by <hi>aſcribing greatneſſe to our God,</hi> they underſtand alſo glorify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of God, and extolling his name; and ſo they conceive the meaning of theſe words to be as if Moſes had ſaid, becauſe I intend to ſhew forth the glory of the Lord, the drift of this ſong being to praiſe his name by ſhewing his faithfull &amp; righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous dealing with Iſrael, and ſo to lay the blame of their revolt upon them, and to clear God of it, therefore let Iſrael <hi>aſcribe greatneſſe to our God,</hi> to wit, either by obeying his will, or elſe by juſtifying God and condemning themſelves if they

               <p>Theſe two verſes following contain the ſumme of the greateſt part of the ſong, to wit, that God was no way to be blamed for his dealing with the Iſraelites, but that all the blame muſt reſt upon them, who had cauſeleſly revolted from him, and ſo had given him juſt cauſe to poure out his wrath upon them. Had God failed or come ſhort in any thing that ſhould have been done, had he not made good his promiſes, or had there been any thing to be deſired that was not to be found in God, their defection from him might have been excuſed under that pretence. But no ſuch thing could be ſaid of God. No, ſaith Moſes, <hi>He is the rock, his work is perfect,</hi> &amp;c. firſt, <hi>he is the rock,</hi> that is, he is an almighty, ſtable<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſure refuge and foundation to all thoſe that fly to him, and rely upon him, <hi>If God be for us, who can be against us?</hi> Rom. 8. 31. nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther indeed is there any ſure ſhelter to be had but onely in him. In times of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger men uſed to fly to rocks to ſhelter themſelves, 1. Sam. 13. 6. To ſhew there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that in times of danger thoſe that flie to God, and are taken into his protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, are ſure and ſafe, and none but they, the Scripture ſtyles him <hi>the rock:</hi> as the coney that flies to the holes in the rocks doth eaſily avoyd the dogges that purſue her, when the hare, that truſts to the ſwiftneſſe of her legs, is at length overtaken and torn in pieces; ſo thoſe that ſeek rightly to God in their diſtreſſe, and truſt in nothing but his protection, do find him a ſure impregnable rock of defence, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as they that truſt in their own policy, or wealth, &amp;c. ſhall at length be ſurpriſed and deſtroyed, and there ſhall be none to help them. Thus God is the rock. And again, <hi>his work is perfect; for all his wayes are judgement,</hi> &amp;c. that is, his dealing with his people hath been exactly juſt and holy in the higheſt degree of perfection, nor hath there been any the leaſt failing in any thing that he hath done, Jer. 2. 5. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord, What iniquity have your fathers found in me, that they are gone farre from me,</hi> &amp;c. And indeed becauſe God is infinite in power, and wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and goodneſſe, &amp;c. and therefore it is not poſſible that any thing ſhould be

               <p>Two ſeverall wayes this verſe may be probably expounded: firſt thus, That when God by his providence did diſpoſe of the ſeverall nations, that came out of the loyns of Adam, in the ſeverall parts of the world, allotting to one nation one countrey, and another to another, even as a man that hath ſome great Lordſhip divides it out by parcels to ſeverall tenants (and this the Lord did in the age after the confuſion of tongues at Babel; for every nation did then plant themſelves, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as God by his eternall decree had <hi>determined and ſet the bounds of their habitation,</hi> Acts 17. 26.) then <hi>did he ſet the bounds of the people according to the number of the children of Iſrael,</hi> that is, he choſe the children of Iſrael to be his onely peculiar inheritance, where they were there was his people, and where their bounds ended, there was an end of his people, and there the bounds of the heathen began. But ſecondly thus, That when God did at firſt divide the earth amongſt the ſeverall nations, and bring every one of them to countreys which by his eternall decree he had determined for their habitation, even then did he think of Iſrael be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they were yet a people, and took care that they ſhould have a competent por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion reſerved for them, to wit, the land of Canaan, which was for their uſe put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the hands of the Canaanites, to whom he allotted ſo much of the earth as he knew would ſerve for the Iſraelites, and ſo, as it is ſaid here<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               <p>The wilderneſſe is called <hi>the waſt howling wilderneſſe,</hi> becauſe of the howling both of beaſts and birds, that uſually keep in ſuch wild and deſolate places; and it may be alſo becauſe of the dolefull complaints of thoſe that travelling thoſe deſerts do often periſh for want of food. But why is it ſaid that the Lord found the Iſraelites in a deſert land, and in the waſt howling wilderneſſe? Not becauſe the Lord never took them to be his people till they were in the wilderneſſe; for they were the Lords people when they were in Egypt. <hi>I have ſeen,</hi> ſaith the Lord to Moſes, <hi>the afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of my people which are in Egypt,</hi> Exod. 3. 7. and it was the Lord that brought them thence out of the tender compaſſion that he had of them: but either becauſe it was in the wilderneſſe, to wit at Sinal, that he firſt entred ſolemnly into a cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with them, that he would be their God, and they ſhould be his people, and ſo gave them his laws to which they were bound to ſubmit themſelves; or elſe rather, onely to imply the deſperate danger wherein the Iſraelites were when they were in the wilderneſſe, but that God came to their ſuccour when they were ready to periſh: for indeed I do not think that the drift of this word <hi>found,</hi> was to ſhew when God began to take pity of Iſrael, or when they firſt began to be his people; but onely to ſet forth how likely they were to periſh there, but that God delivered them, to wit, that they were then like a poore helpleſſe infant laid forth in a deſert, whom ſome man caſually ſinds and preſerves, when before he lay ready every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to periſh. Yea beſide, under this which is ſaid concerning their outward dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in the deſert, I doubt not but the ſpirit of God intended alſo to imply the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate danger of their ſpirituall condition, when God firſt ſet his love upon them, and choſe them to be his people, to wit, that they were in the ſtate of corruption and death, but that God received them: for thus the Lord by the prophet Ezekiel ſets forth the danger of their naturall eſtate, by comparing them to a new-born in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant laid out in ſome deſperate place, Ezek. 16. 4. <hi>As for thy nativity, in the day thou wast born, thy navel was not cut, neither waſt thou waſhed with water to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple thee: thou waſt not ſalted at all, nor ſwadled at all.

               <p>Two circumſtances are here noted in the Iſraelites idolatry, by way of aggravating their ſinne: the firſt is, that they worſhipped <hi>new gods that came newly up;</hi> and the ſtrange gods of the heathens, which the Iſraelites worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, though they had continued in the world many hundred years, are yet term<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>new gods, newly come up,</hi> becauſe indeed they were no better if compared with the eternall ever-living God, who is called <hi>the ancient of dayes,</hi> Dan. 7. 9. and who is indeed onely to be worſhipped; and alſo becauſe this way of religious worſhip was but a new invention in compariſon of the true worſhip, wherewith the true God had been worſhipped in his Church from the firſt beginning of time, &amp;c. That onely which is from the beginning is truly ancient, and of this therefore it is that the Prophet ſpeaks, Jer. 6. 16. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord, Stand ye in the wayes, and ſee, and ask for the old paths, where is the good way,</hi> &amp;c. and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is erroneus in religion, though of never ſo long ſtanding, it is but a novelty. The ſecond is, that they were fallen to the worſhipping of gods <hi>whom their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers feared not,</hi> that is, ſuch as their fathers ſlighted as vanities, gods that could do neither good nor hurt, Jer. 10. 5. and were not therefore worthy their fear; and this too did make their ſinne farre the worſe, and that becauſe though it be not alwayes ſafe for men to follow the way of their fathers in matters of religion, yet when their fathers worſhipped God aright, and ſo they had not onely the word of God for their rule, but alſo the example of their fathers to encourage and lead them on, then to decline from the way of the truth, from their fathers conveyed to them, merely out of a fickle and inconſtant ſpirit, muſt needs greatly aggravate their ſinne.</p>

               <p>The ſumme of that which is here threatned is this, that ſince they had <hi>mobed him to jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie,</hi> that is, provoked him to diſpleaſure, <hi>with that which was not God,</hi> that is, by giving away the worſhip which was due onely to him, to gods which were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed no gods, ſo preferring mere vanities, perhaps ſtocks and ſtones, before their creatour, therefore he would <hi>move them to jealouſie,</hi> that is, would vex and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet them, <hi>with thoſe which are not a people,</hi> even <hi>with a fooliſh nation,</hi> that is by preferring as it were the heathen before them that had been his peculiar people. And this the Lord did to the Iſraelites two ſeverall wayes: firſt, when he took part with the heathens, and made them victorious over the Iſraelites, when the Aſſyri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, the Babylonians and other heathen people, which were deſpiſed by the Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elites as poore, blind, ſilly wretches, that knew nothing of God, nor had any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in God, were by the help of Gods providence crowned with one victory af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter another in their warres againſt the Iſraelites, and did at laſt make them their bondſlaves, and tread them down as dirt in the ſtreets: this muſt needs mightily vex and diſquiet them; for why, think they, ſhould the uncircumciſed thus trample upon the Iſrael of God? and thus did God move them to jealouſie with thoſe which were not a people, &amp;c. But ſecondly, the Lord did this moſt eminently when he cu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And indeed if a Prince ſhould take ſome baſe beggar to his bed and board to vex his wife, that had formerly plaid the harlot with ſome baſe unworthy groom, this could not be a greater vexation to her, then it was alwayes to the Jews to think that the Gentiles, whom they deſpiſed for their blindneſſe and folly, ſhould come to be eſpouſed to God in Chriſt, and enjoy the priviledges of Gods Church and people, and they ſhould be caſt off. Even the believing Jews were not without much ado brought to yield to this truth of the Gentiles calling, Act. 11. 2, 3. and much more was it a matter of great vexation and indignation to the reſt, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed ſo it is unto this day.

               <p>That is, their gods are not as our God, and that the Heathen themſelves cannot denie.

               <p>That is, all Iſraels ſaints are in thy cuſtody and protection, O Lord.

               <q>And they ſat down at thy feet, every one ſhall receive of thy word.]</q>
               <p>This may be added either further to illuſtrate the mercy of God to Iſrael in giving them his Law, when as his peculiar people he inſtructed them in thoſe things that concerned the good of their ſouls, and they willingly ſubmitted themſelves to be inſtructed and directed by him; or elſe it may be added as a note of diſtinction whereby the ſaints in Iſrael might be known from ſuch as were onely Iſraelites by outward profeſſion, namely, that ſuch as were ſaints indeed, would willingly receive and obey his word; and therefore is that clauſe added, <hi>every one ſhall receive of thy word:</hi> However that phraſe, <hi>they ſat down at thy feet,</hi> is certainly meant of Gods inſtructing them, and the peoples readineſſe to receive his inſtruction; and either it hath reference to the abiding of the Iſraelites at the foot of mount Sinai to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Law from God, ſpeaking from the top of the mount unto them after the manner as diſciples uſed to ſit at the feet of their maſter, who from ſome higher ſeat did reade unto them, whereupon it was that S.

               <p>This which Moſes ſpeaks concerning himſelf, in the name of the people, is added to maintain the credit that was due to his miniſtery, to ſhew that God had ſet him over them to teach and govern them, and conſequently, that what he ſhould now ſay, as well as what he had before, was to be received as if it had been ſpoken the God himſelf from heaven. As for thoſe words, <hi>even the inheritance of the congregation of Jacob,</hi> the Law is ſo called, becauſe God gave it them as a rare and precious treaſure, not for their uſe onely, but for the uſe of their poſterity after them.</p>

               <p>By Jefurun is meant Iſrael, as before, chap. 32. 15. concerning which ſee the notes there. Now though it be ſaid here of Moſes (for this hath reference to the foregoing verſe, where he ſpake of himſelf in a third perſon) that he was King amongſt them, yet thereby is not meant that he was indeed a King, and ruled as a Monarch amongſt them, but onely that when the Princes and people were aſſembled together he was chief amongſt them, and as it were a King: He was in the ſupreme place of Magiſtracy, and did the work of a
<pb n="564" facs="tcp:103385:294"/>
King, he gave them a Law (though indeed that which he received from God) and their chief affairs were ſtill ordered by his direction. And thus with this clauſe Moſes cloſeth up the Preface prefixed before the bleſſings, wherein, by declaring the ſpeciall love which God had alwayes ſhown to this people, and how God had alwayes made uſe of him to make known his will to them, he prepared the people to receive as from God that which in the following bleſſings he ſhould ſay con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning their ſeverall tribes.</p>

               <p>Jacob had prophecyed concerning this tribe that they ſhould loſe the dignity of the birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, and ſhould never come to any excellency amongſt the tribes either for the number of the people, or any other preheminence, and that becauſe of the inceſt of Reuben with his fathers concubine, Gen. 49. 4. <hi>

(it was the place where Moſes firſt fetcht water out of the rock in Horeb that was called Maſſah and Meribah, Exod. 17. 7.) yet becauſe the Lord did there <hi>prove</hi> Moſes and Aaron, even that place is alſo called <hi>Maſſah,</hi> that is <hi>temptation</hi> or <hi>proof:</hi> ſecondly, that it is ſaid that the Lord did <hi>prove Levi,</hi> that is, Moſes and Aaron, <hi>at Maſſah,</hi> and did <hi>ſtrive with them at the waters of Meribah,</hi> becauſe he did there trie their faith,
<pb n="566" facs="tcp:103385:295"/>
and ſharply reprove them for their infidelitie; and thirdly, that this is here added both by way of commending the zeal of Aaron (for zealous for God he then ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf, though weak in faith) and alſo by way of magnifying Gods mercie in ſettling the prieſthood upon his poſteritie, though he at that time ſo greatly offended him through his unbelief.</p>
