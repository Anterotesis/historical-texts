            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE The EARL of EGLINGTON, <hi>Mercy and Peace through Iesus Christ.</hi>
            </head>
            <opener>
               <salute>My right Noble Lord,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE reason of my sending forth of this piece, under your Lordships name, is, that by this means I may pay home before I die, the old debt which I owe to your Lordship, and to the whole noble family, for countenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing and encouraging me openly in my Ministery, all the while I was in <hi>Irwin</hi> near your Lordship, full twenty yeares.</p>
            <p>And the reason why I do confesse my debt now, and go about to discharge some part of it, at this time of your Lordships restraint in <hi>England,</hi> is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause when I call to minde the time of my restraint about some thirty yeares ago, (when the High Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission Court of Prelates procured my confinement within a little village in the North beyond <hi>Aberdein,</hi> in regard I could not give them satisfaction by recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the yoak of some Popish ceremonies, imposed
<pb facs="tcp:66460:3"/>
then upon the Ministery,) I cannot forget how comfortable your Lordship was to me then, and what paines and travel you endured summer and winter without wearying, untill they who at that time had power to loose me from my confinement, being made sensible, some of them of the iniquity, and all of them of the inexpediencie of keeping me in bonds, I was restored to the free and full use of my Ministery. Wherefore I do esteem it a part of due gratitude, to do what in me lieth, to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable to your Lordship in this your present con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition; and do heartily pray to God that your ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise and trouble, may prove a meanes of your happinesse. It is true indeed, that happinesse with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this meanes were to be wished, if so it were Gods pleasure; but unto God onely (in whose hands <q>alone it is to make men blessed, and in</q> whose friendship and favour through Christ on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly men are really blessed) it doth belong, as to choose the man to whom, so also to choose the meanes whereby, and the manner how he will communicate the right and possession of true bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sednesse. If happinesse were at mens wish and carving, no man would choose God for his chief good, nor Gods way to bring his felicity about; for the multitude of men do say, <hi>Psal. 4. 6. Who will shew us any good?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The good which God doth shew unto them, and the way how by reconciliation with himself, and walking humbly and uprightly before him, they may have God to be their <hi>rich reward,</hi> is not the thing they love to have; but corn and wine and oile, and whatsoever may best please their fleshly fancie, is their desire. And of this the
<pb facs="tcp:66460:3"/>
Lord doth complain, <hi>Psal. 81. 11. My people,</hi> saith he, <hi>would not hearken to my voice, and Israel would none of me.</hi> And what was it which they did preferre unto God? they loved to have their own will in this world, whatsoever should befall them after death; they loved rather to have their own earthly desires satisfied, then to have the friendship of God: and their choice was given unto them to their owne destruction. <hi>So</hi> (saith the Lord) <hi>I gave them over to their owne hearts lust, and they walked in the counsell of their owne heart.</hi> Few, when they look upon the course which the world doth runne after, yea very few do preferre the fellowship of God reconciled to them in Christ, before riches, honour, and sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sual pleasure: For, <hi>Who will shew us any good?</hi> is that which many do say, <hi>Psala</hi> 4. 6. bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>Lord, lift thou up the light of thy countenance upon us,</hi> is the petition of the few opposed to the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude; and even those few godly would wish to go to heaven with ease, and to be free from trouble in their journey, if it were the Lords will, as we may see in the prayer of <hi>Iabez, 1 Chron. 4. 10. Who called on the God of Israel saying, Oh that thou wouldest blesse me indeed, and enlarge my coast, and that thine hand might be with me, and that thou wouldest keep me from evill, that it may not grieve me.</hi> But our loving and wise God, who knoweth perfectly what is fittest for every man, doth crosse and correct those natural de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires of his children. And howsoever he will now and then possibly grant the prayer of <hi>Iabez,</hi> to some of his people, yet he hath appointed this to be the ordinary road-way to heaven, which
<pb facs="tcp:66460:4"/>
the Apostle pointeth forth to us, <hi>Acts 14. 22. We must through much tribulation enter into the Kingdom of God,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this course of carrying of Gods children through many afflictions, doth no wayes hinder their happinesse; for how many soever their cros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses be, yet this holdeth alwayes fast, <hi>Psal. 65. 4. Blessed is the man whom thou choosest, and causest to approach unto thee.</hi> If therefore by plurality of chastisements, the Lord shall draw, and drive them to seek remission of sinnes and reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with himself, and the renewed sense thereof through Christ, and shall by the rod hedge them within the way of walking with him in a friendly communion: they lose nothing except their lusts, and do gain eternal blessednesse. And certain<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y there is so much reliques of natural cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, so strong inclinations unto sinne, so many actuall outbreakings, and grosse transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions to be found in the most precious Saints, that there is no wonder the Lord should visit their trespasses with the rod, and their iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty with stripes; but all the wonder is, that he will not take his loving kindnes utterly from them. There is also so great need of loosing their affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions from what seemeth love-worthy in this world; so great need of raising the hearts of the heires of Salvation unto the seeking of a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, which cannot be shaken, and of a crown uncorruptible; as all reason doth call for the mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of troubles with earthly comforts, lest the sweetnesse of temporary vanities should prove un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them poysonable. Moreover, the experience of the Saints set down in Scripture, and especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
<pb facs="tcp:66460:4"/>
in the Psalmes, doth make it manifest, that by the variety of outward and inward troubles the faith of Gods children hath been tried, and trained to farther strength. Their love, hope, and patience, and all other spiritual graces in them have been so fostered and augmented, as they have been made joyfully and thankfully to subscribe this truth, <hi>Psal. 94. 12. Blessed it the man whom thou chastenest, O Lord, and teachest him out of thy Law.</hi> This is the language of the Lords present dispensation toward his people, and the lesson which his Providence doth recommend to us all, that we may learn it to our good: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto if this piece shall contribute any thing for the edifying of those who shall be pleased to read it; and in speciall, if it shall be acceptable to your Lordship, this shall do much more then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence the labour of</p>

                  <p>In this first affectionate prayer for remission of sins, <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. As the conscience, till it be awakened by God, cannot appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend how displeasant sin is to God; how it meriteth wrath; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

with it: So after it is wakened, it can see no refuge till it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider that mercy may be had in God, and then the more it is pressed by the Law, or fear of wrath, the more it seeketh after Gods mercy, as here we see; <hi>Have mercy on m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        </gap>, O God.</hi> 2. The consideration of the Lords loving kindnesse, and readinesse to forgive the sinner that cometh unto him, should keep the sinner, (how grievous soever his offence hath been) from running away from him, yea should give him hope to meet with mercy, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever may be his demerits: <hi>Have mercy, O God on me, according to thy loving kindnesse.</hi> 3. Sin is a debt obliging a man to a penalty which he cannot pay, but must be forgiven, otherwayes he perisheth, as <hi>blot out my transgressions</hi> doth import. 4. All doubts arising from the multitude of sins forgiven before, and from the abuse of many mercies already received, and from the deep deservings of most hainous sins, are solved, when Gods lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving kindnesse, and the multitude of the mercies of God are op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to these doubts and fears, and are put in the balance over against them; <hi>according to thy loving kindnesse, according to the multitude of thy mereies, blot out my transg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

When a Saint now justified doth any thing against the Law of God, his sin is so farre from being extenuated or made lesse, as by the contrary it is multiplied so much the more, and found to have in it a plurality of sins, when it is rightly considered; <hi>blot out</hi> (saith he) <hi>my transgressions,</hi> in the plural number. 6. Sin, as it bindeth a man over to punishment, till he be forgiven; so it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fileth a man, and puts an abominable deformity on him, which his illuminate conscience cannot look upon, without loathing, till it be by pardon and purging washed away; <hi>wash me and cleanse me from mine iniquity and my sin.</hi> 7. The pollution of sin goeth through the whole powers of the soul and body, which have been serviceable to it; through minde, will, affections, senses bodily, and all, and nothing can quiet the soul here, except it finde pardoning mercy, and sanctifying mercy, going after all the soule footsteps of sin, and doing away the filthinesse thereof, <hi>wash me throughly, and cleanse me.</hi>

                  <p>Here he maketh confession of his sin and sinfulnesse, and ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravateth his guiltinesse, from the very root of original sinne, and subscribeth whatsoever God hath spoken of mans sinful nature, and deserved punishment in the Scripture approving himself for the sincerity of his confession unto God. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. Whosoever would have mercy and pardon of his sin from God, must acknowledge his sin and debt, and must take part with God, and with justice against himself, because the Psalmist here giveth this for a reason of his hope of pardon, <hi>for I acknowledge my transgression.</hi> 2. Albeit God hath pardoned sin to a peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent soul, and albeit his Ministers have made declaration of the pardon to him, yet the conscience will not pronounce the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of absolution, but still present the sin as unpardoned, till God make it quiet by his immediate intimation: for <hi>David</hi> after that <hi>Nathan</hi> had told him from the Lord, that his iniquity was pardoned, still findeth the conscience pursuing for the guilt, <hi>my sinne is ever before me.</hi> 3. The dividing of the grant of pardon from the effectual intimation thereof unto the conscience, is done in Gods wisdome and mercy towards his childe for good: for here it ripeneth repentance, and bringeth forth this deep confession, <hi>I acknowledge mine iniquity, and my sinne is ever before me.</hi> 4. It is most suitable for true repentance, to pitch upon some particular sin, in the vilenesse whereof the evil of other sins may be taken up and lamented <hi>against thee have I done this evill;</hi> he meaneth the particular whereof <hi>Nathan</hi> charged him in the matter of <hi>Uriah.</hi> 5. The material injury and hurt of a sinful action may resolve upon a creature, but the formall obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity of the action resolveth upon the law or command of God, and upon his sovereigne authority which gave the law; <hi>against thee, thee have I sinned.</hi> 6. If the injury done to the creature, could be severed from the offence done to God, the conscience would not be so much troubled for the first as for the last <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

                     <pb n="5" facs="tcp:66460:7"/>
if the injury done to God against so many obligations, be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with the injury done to the creature; the injury done to God is so high as it comprehendeth all the challenge which the creature could make for its part, and leaveth nothing to the creature to say besides: Therefore saith he, <hi>against thee, thee onely have I sinned, and done this evill in thy sight,</hi> 7. Albeit no man should challenge for a wrong done by one man to another, and in particular for a wrong done to a subject by a Prince or Ruler, yet will the Lord challenge for it, and bring the man to an accompt for it, <hi>against thee, thee onely have I sinned.</hi> 8 How closely soever the circumstances of a sinful action be conveyed, that men should not see the vilenesse thereof, yet before God all the matter is plaine: <hi>I have done this evill in thy sight,</hi> saith he. 9. The conscience rightly wakened in the sense of sin, cannot but justifie what God hath spoken in his Word of mans sinful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and of the merit of sin, and of whatsoever God hath done, or shall do in the punishing of sin: for <hi>David</hi> maketh this deep confession of sin against himself, <hi>that God may be justified when he speaketh, and cleare when he is judged.</hi> 10. Although presumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous man will not stand to examine, judge, and passe sentence up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on God, and his words, and his works, yet shall no m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>n be able to bear a blot upon God; but every conscience when awake, shall be found to blame the man, and to justifie God in all his words and proceedings, as <hi>David</hi> is forced to blame himself here, <hi>that God may be justified when he speaketh, and clear when he is judged.</hi> 11. As original sin is common to all men by natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall propagation from their parents, so is it not abolished out of the most holy in this life, and as it is found to utter it self by actual transgressions, in the children of God, so must the evill thereof be acknowledged by them, and that not to extenuate, but to aggravate their sin thereby, as <hi>David</hi> sheweth here, saying, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, I was shapen in iniquity, and in sin did my mother conceive me.</hi> 12. No confession of sin, nor any other part of Gods wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship giveth ease to the minde, or is acceptable to God, except it be done in sincerity and truth, and when it is done in spirit and truth, it is acceptable to God, and giveth eare to the conscience; Behold, (saith <hi>David</hi> after his deep confession) <hi>thou desirest truth in the inward parts.</hi> 13. The last operation of Gods gr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

of grace in himself, he may expect to finde yet more grace from God, as <hi>David</hi> after this observation of grace given unto him, to make a sincere confession of his sin, doth expect that God shall effectually teach him more wisdome, or wise behaviour in his sight. <hi>In the hidden part thou wilt make me to know wisdom;</hi> that is, thou wilt make my conscience judge yet more impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially of my native sinfulnesse, and wilt teach me to walk more circumspectly before thee, in the sense of my sinfulnesse.</p>

No lesse loathsome then leprosie is the sight of sin, when it is looked upon as unpardoned; and nothing lesse then the bloud of Christ signified by the bloud of the clean bird slaine to cleanse the leper, can purge a man of it, for <hi>David</hi> doth look unto the manner of cleansing the leper, as it is set down, <hi>Levit.</hi> 14. Where two birds were taken, and one of them slaine, and the living bird being dipped with bysope in the bloud of the slaine bird, was let flie away, to signifie the leprous sinners deliverance from perdition by the bloud of that cleanly bird Jesus Christ: <hi>purge me with by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sope,</hi> saith he. 2. Whatsoever application hath been made to a man of Christs blood in justification of his person, it doth not hinder, but rather doth open a way unto the renewed acts of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication thereof, according as new sins do draw on new guilti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse: for here justified <hi>David</hi> prayeth to be yet again purged with bysope. 3.

Howsoever remission of the guilt for Christs sake, be inse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable from the imputation of righteousnesse for Christs sake, yet may these two be distinguished, and distinctly looked upon for the beleevers comfort; for here <hi>David</hi> looking on the removing of the guiltinesse of sin by Christs death, saith, <hi>purge me with bysope, and I shall be cleane:</hi> and looking upon the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of Christs righteousnesse, or obedience even unto <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Now that these two branches of this mercy are distinguishable, may appear from this, that as to be freed from eternal torment is one benefit, put case a man were annihilated in his loosing from it; and to be not onely freed from eternal torment, but also made blessed by the gift of eternal life, is another and a greater benefit: So removing the guilt of sin, in relation to the remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of punishment is one thing, and the assignation of Christs righteousnesse in relation to eternal life is another thing; and these two benefits both of them are purchased by Christs perfect obedience unto the death, and are holden forth, <hi>Levit.</hi> 14. for after the delivery of the leper from death (figured and symboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed by the letting go of the living bird, dipped in the bloud of the slaine bird) the cloathing of the leper with righteousnesse, is figured and symbolized by the washing of the man, and putting clean cloaths upon him. Now it is not the mans personal san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification inherent, (which in every man is joyned with much pollution) that maketh him clean, but the imputation of Christs righteousnesse; This maketh him <hi>whiter then snow.</hi> 5. As we must not neglect the Ordinances of God, but must use them carefully for obedience unto God, and for strengthening of our faith, so we must not rest upon them, but seek in unto the signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, substance, and end of them, which is Christ; as here <hi>David</hi> seeketh perfect pardon by Christs blood, perfect purging and cleansing through him under the termes of <hi>purging with bysope and washing.</hi> 6. The grief and torment which followeth sinne, and is felt by a wounded spirit, even in the children of God, in the time of their repentance, is greater then ever the pleasure of sin was to them, as <hi>David</hi> sheweth here, who speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of his vexation, and wounded spirit, as of the painfullest trouble which can fall upon the body: for by <hi>the bones which thou hast broken,</hi> he meaneth the chastisement of his spirit, inflicted of God. 7. Nothing can heal this wound of the spirit, save the hand that made it; nothing but Gods lively application of his word of Grace and pardon to the guilty s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

There are two parts of the Psalme, the first containeth his prayer for deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, which is pressed by six arguments, all serving to strength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en his faith; the first, because he trusted in God, <hi>ver.</hi> 1.

The sixth is, from the low condition whereunto his spirit is brought, by their crafty and cruel pursuit of him, <hi>ver.</hi> 6. In the rest of the Psalme is his thanksgiving, consisting of five parts; The first is the acknowlegement of the mercy and delivery granted, <hi>ver.</hi> 6.

Sometime the Lord will delay the cutting off of wicked enemies of his people, for a curse to them, and a benefit to his people: <hi>Slay them not, left my people forget.</hi> 2. The Lords people are subject to forget the Lords do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for them, and punishing of their enemies, except the Lord did renew the evidence of his care he hath of them, by often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed, or long continued judgement on their enemies, whose misery is made more to them, by lingring judgements in the sight of men, then if they were cut off more suddenly; <hi>Slay them not, left my people forget;</hi> 3.

It is the good of the Lords people, and the glorifying of God which is in his eyes. 4.

Albeit the Persecutors do not accomplish their purpose against the righteous; yet their pride, their brags, their lies, their slanders, their curses against the godly, are a sufficient ditty for damnation, and wrath to come upon them; <hi>For the sin of their mouth, and the words of their lips, let them even be taken in their pride, and for cursing and lying which they speak.</hi> 6.

               <p>From the Inscription; <hi>Learne,</hi> 1. The children of God must not think it strange, to be put to wrastling, striving and fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for a promised Kingdome, before they be setled in possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as <hi>David</hi> was; yea, the Church of Christ must resolve for such like exercises; for this Psalm is given to the publike Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of the Church for use in all ages. 2. The Church must make use of her prayers, as well when she is furnished with a regular army, as when she wanteth bodily armes, as <hi>David</hi> teacheth the Church here. 3. There is hope of victory, when God by prayer is more relied upon, then the army in the fields; for with the Psalme the mention of the victory of the Lords hoste is set down, and the slaughter of the enemy recorded; <hi>That Ioab smote of</hi> Edom <hi>twelve thousand.</hi>

From the second fruit of the gracious answer given to <hi>Davids</hi> prayer, that is, from his giving the glory of the acts of grace which he did unto God the furnisher thereof; <hi>Learne,</hi> 1. The Lord useth to exercise the soules of his own children with sense of desertion, and withdrawing of his presence one way or other. This is presupposed in <hi>Davids following after the Lord,</hi> when he felt him retiring himself, as it were. 2. A believer in God cannot endure a thought of separation from God, nor forbear to seek after God, when he misseth his presence, but will use all meanes to recover the sense of his presence which he hath felt before; <hi>My soule followeth hard after thee.</hi> 3. It is our wisdom to reflect upon, and acknowledge the grace of God in us, and upon the acts of our saith and love toward God, for our own strengthening, as <hi>David</hi> doth here, saying, <hi>My soul followeth hard after thee.</hi> 4. Although the exercise of graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous habits be our acts, yet the enabling of us to bring these acts forth, is the Lords work, who giveth us both to will and to do of his own good pleasure; and as it is our duty to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge this, so is it the fruit of our feelings of Gods help to professe it; <hi>My soul followeth hard after thee,</hi> but by what power, strength and furniture doth he this? <hi>Thy right hand upholdeth me.</hi>

Although prayer and praises do alwayes agree well, yet some time may call for prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, and for the work of praise only, and may take up the whole man for a time, as here. 2. How mournful a condition soever the Lords people may be in, yet God is preparing thereby mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for his own glory; <hi>Praise waiteth for thee.</hi> And whatsoever matter of praise be seen, or whatsoever measure of praise be given unto God by his people, more is due to him, and more is making ready for him; <hi>Praise waiteth for thee.</hi> 3. Although the rest of the world be senselesse of Gods benefits, yet his Church must set about the work of his praises, and shall be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled to give him praise; <hi>Praise waiteth for thee, O God, in Sion.</hi> 4. As it is the duty of every man, who doth seek deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance from trouble, or any other benefit from God, to oblige himself, to praise God for it: so it is the Lords manner to gaine to himself praise by granting prayers, and to purchase the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of praises promised unto him; <hi>Unto thee shall the vow be performed.</hi>

                  <p>From the first reason of the Lords praise; <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. The hearing and granting of prayer is the Lords property, and his usual pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, and his pleasure, and his nature, and his glory; <hi>O thou that hearest prayer!</hi> 2. The readinesse of the Lord to hear prayer, doth open the door of accesse to all sorts of people, who are sensible of their own frailty and necessities, and do know his readinesse to relieve them, Gentiles as well as Jewes shall come unto him; <hi>O thou that hearest prayer! all flesh shall come unto thee.</hi>

                  <p>From the second reason of the Lords praise; <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. Sin is a sore adversary, and many times prevails over us, and drawes on troubles on us, which makes us know the ill of it better, then we knew before the committing of it; <hi>Iniquities prevaile against me.</hi> 2. Whatsoever be the sins of the people we live amongst, let us make special accompt of our own guiltiness in the point of confession, as <hi>David</hi> doth here, when he saith, <hi>Iniquities prevaile against me.</hi> 3. Our sins should be looked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, not to chase us from God, but to humble us, and drive us to seek pardon and purgation from the Lord, whose free grace only can take sins away; <hi>Iniquity prevails over me: as for our transgressions, thou shalt purge them away.</hi> 4. The holy Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets and Pen men of Scripture have no grounds of hope for pardon of sin, save those which are common to the meanest of Gods people; for <hi>David</hi> in his confession cometh in by himself alone aggravating his own sins most; <hi>Iniquities prevail against me,</hi> saith he. But in the hope of pardon, he joyneth with the rest of Gods people, saying, <hi>As for our transgressions, thou shalt purge them away.</hi>

                  </q>
                  <p>The fourth reason of the Lords praise is taken from the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending of his Church in all ages and places: and saving of his people by giving terrible answers to their prayers against their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, for the performance of his own word, and confirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the faith of his own people, in whatsoever part of the earth, unto the end of the world. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. As the love of God to his people doth not exempt them from the molestation of ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, because the Lord will have the faith of his people by this means exercised, and them put to pray unto him, and complain of the injuries done unto them; so his love to them will not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer their prayers to want an answer in their troubles, to the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mozement of their adversaries; <hi>By terrible things wilt thou an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer us.</hi> 2.

friends of his people, and a foe to their foes; <hi>By terrible things in righteousnesse, wilt thou answer us.</hi> 3. The reason of particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar deliveries of Gods people from their enemies, is, because these deliveries are appendices of the Covenant of grace, established for giving to them everlasting life; <hi>Thou wilt answer us O God of our salvation.</hi> 4. What the Lord hath promised and done to his Church of old, is a sufficient ground of confidence to the people of God, in all times and places, to expect and finde the like mercy, unto that which they of old did expect and finde; <hi>O God of our salvation, the confidence of all the ends of the earth, and of them that are afar off, upon the sea:</hi> that is, thy people, whether dwelling in the Continent, or in Isles; or sailing on the sea.</p>

                  <p>Here the Psalmist, as the Lords pen-man, doth furnish matter and words of praising God unto the hearers, and prophesieth that the fulnesse of the Gentiles shall concurre in his worship, and take part in the song of his praise; <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause we can do nothing of our selves in this work of the Lords praise, God must furnish to us matter &amp; words; <hi>Say unto God, How terrible, &amp;c.</hi> 2. As the work of the praise of God should be done in love and confidence, and sincerity, and in his own strength: so may it be directed to him immediately, and that without flattery; (otherwayes then men are praised) for praise properly is due to God only, and no man can speak of him, except in his own au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience; <hi>Say unto God, How terrible art thou in thy works?</hi> 3. The works of the Lord, every one of them being rightly stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died, are able to affright us, by discovering the incomparable, dreadful, and omnipotent Majesty of the worker thereof; <hi>How terrible art thou in thy works?</hi> 4. When the Lord is pleased to let forth his judgements on his adversaries, and to let them see what he can do, none of them dare stand out against him; but if they be not converted, yet will they be forced to feign submission unto him; <hi>Through the greatnesse of thy power shall thy enemies submit themselves to them?</hi> 5. Over and above what is already accomplished of this prophecie concerning the conversion of the Gentiles, a higher measure is yet to be expected in the bringing in of that number of them, which the Scripture calleth <hi>the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the Gentiles;</hi> and the making all the <hi>Kingdomes of the earth to become the Lords, and his Sonne Christs;</hi> for this word in a greater measure then yet is come to passe, must be fulfilled; <hi>All the earth shall worship thee, they shall sing unto thee; they shall sing unto thy Name:</hi> Which word doth import the revealing of the glad tidings of Jesus Christ unto them, and their joyful ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation of the Gospel, and glorifying of God for it. 6. As
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:66460:50"/>
it is the Lords glory to have many praising him: so should it be the joy of all that love him, now to foresee the successe of Christs Kingdome, as well as it was of old, when it was the Churches song; <hi>All the earth shall worship thee.</hi>

Albeit the Lord doth work for the delivery of the Church, and his own glory, yet men are so carelesse, to observe his works, that they can neither make use thereof for their own profit, nor for Gods praise; so that there is much need to stirre up our dulnesse, to observe them and make right use thereof; <hi>Come and see the works of God.</hi> 2. Whosoever do observe the works of God, which he hath wrought for his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, they shall be forced to fear and admire his wonderful Acts for them, and his respect unto them; <hi>He is terrible in his doing toward the children of men.</hi> 3. The work of redemption of his Church out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> is a work one for all worthy to be made use of to the end of the world; and sufficient to shew, that if need be, God will invert the course of nature for the good of his people, and for their delivery out of difficulties; <hi>He turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the sea into dry land.</hi> 4. As the Lord will work wonders for the delivery of his people out of misery: so will he work wonders for performing of promises to them, and for bringing them to the possession of what he hath given them right unto; for the drying of the river <hi>Iordan,</hi> that his people might go in to possesse the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised land, was a pawn and evidence of this his purpose for all time coming; <hi>They went through the flood on foot.</hi> 5. As all the people of God are one body, and that which is done in one age to one generation doth concern all and every one to make use of it in their generation: so every one in after-ages should reckon themselves one body with the Lords people in former ages, and make use of Gods dealing with them, as if they had been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent

then with them, as here the <hi>Church</hi> in the <hi>Psalmists</hi> time joyneth it selfe with the Church in <hi>Ioshuahs</hi> time, rejoycing in God with them, at their entring into <hi>Canaan; There did we rejoyce in him,</hi> say they. 6. Whatsoever the Lord hath done for his people in any time by-past, he is able and ready to do the like for his people in any time to come; <hi>He ruleth by his pouer for ever,</hi> and for this cause his former Acts, are perpetual evidences and pledges of like Acts to be done hereafter, as need is. 7. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is done in any place, which the Lord is not witnesse un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to; no plot or motion against his people, which he seeth not: <hi>His eyes behold the Nations.</hi> 8.

                  <p>In the second part of the Psalm, the <hi>Psalmist</hi> exhorts the Church in his time, to praise God for preserving them from ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirpation in the time of their fiery trial, and sore affliction un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the tyranny and oppression of their enemies. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. The Lords people in every age, besides all the reasons they have to praise God for his former works, want not their own particular reasons for his care, providence, and kindnesse to themselves in their own time to stirre up one another to blesse his Majesty; <hi>O blesse our God, ye people.</hi> 2. It is the Churches proper priviledge, and her glory, above all other incorporations and societies beside, to have special interest in God, as her own; <hi>O blesse our God.</hi> 3. It is not sufficient that the Lords people
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:66460:51"/>
acknowledge inwardly the mercies of God to themselves; but it is their duty in an orderly way to bring others on to the knowledge of God, and to shew to others how praise-worthy he is: <hi>make the voice of his praise to be heard.</hi> 4. Albeit the Lord takes many things away from his people, when he is pleased to exercise them, yet he keeps life in their soul; some sweet communion of spirit between himself and them: and doth not suffer all his people to be extirpate, and rooted out from the earth; <hi>Which boldeth our soul in life.</hi> 5. It is great mercy to be kept from desperate courses in the time of sad calamities, and to be supported under burdens, that we sink not; and to be prevented from denying of God, or of his truth in time of persecution: <hi>He suffereth not our feet to be moved.</hi> 6. One end of the troubles of the Church, among others is, the trial of the graces of his people, and purging them from their corruptions: for which cause the Lord useth to bring on one trouble after another, as mettal is put in the fire oftner then once; <hi>For thou, O God, hast proved us, thou hast tried <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

It is wisdome and justice and goodnesse in God, to make his people know some time, whether his service or mens ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice be most easie; <hi>Thou hast caused men to ride over our heads.</hi> 9. When Gods service and mens service are compared, the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of men is a beastly bondage in comparison: for the enemies of the Church will abuse Gods people like beasts, when they fall under their power; <hi>Thou hast made men ride over our heads.</hi> 10. There is no sort of affliction, nor extremity of affliction, from which the godly may secure themselves, after the time of their entring into their trials, till Gods time come, wherein their triall is to end; <hi>We went through fire, and through waters.</hi> 11.

As it is a token of lively faith in desperate troubles to trust in God, and to hope for his deliverance, and to promise him praise before the delivery come: so is it a token of an upright heart, to be as willing to perform promises after the benefit received, as it was ready to make pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises, before the benefit received; <hi>I will pay thee my vowes which my lips have uttered, and my mouth hath spoken when I was in trouble.</hi> 3.

The Spirit of God gave the Church of the Jewes to understand, that the conversion of the Gentiles, especially the conversion of the fulnesse of the Gentiles, (which here is prayed for, when he saith, <hi>Let all the people praise thee)</hi> was to be a means or a mercy antecedent unto, or nearly joyned with the bringing in and blessing of the Jewish Church, and possibly in their own land; <hi>Then shall the earth yield her increase, and God even our own God shall blesse us:</hi> for by the earth he meaneth the promised land of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan,</hi> which hath been, and is accursed, during the time of their ejection out of it. 3.

               <p>
                  <hi>DAvid,</hi> as a type of Christ, earnestly dealeth with God for a delivery from his perplexed condition, and from the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice of his adversaries; and doth finde a comfortable event. There are three parts of the Psalm. In the first, is his prayer, six times presented, and strengthened with new reasons, to <hi>ver.</hi> 22. In the second part of the Psalm, is his imprecation of ten plagues against his enemies, with some reasons added for the justice of the inflicting the plagues, mentioned to <hi>ver.</hi> 29. In the third part, are four evidences of his victory, from <hi>ver.</hi> 29. to the end. In all which, whatsoever is proper to the type, is to be referred to the type only; and whatsoever is fit also to be applied unto Christ the Antitype, must be referred to him only, in that sense which is suitable to his Majesty.</p>
               <p>His prayer at first, is propounded in few words; <hi>Save me:</hi> the reasons are foure. The first, from the danger he was in, <hi>ver.</hi> 1, 2. The next from his long and patient waiting for an answer to his prayer, <hi>ver</hi> 3. The third from the multitude, and malice, and iniquity of his enemies, <hi>ver.</hi> 4. The fourth is by way of attesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God, that he was innocent of that whereof he was char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by his enemies, joyned in with his humble acknowledging of whatsover other sins justice could charge upon him in any other respect, <hi>ver.</hi> 5.</p>

His first Petition is to be saved, and the first reason of it is, because of the danger he was in; <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. A childe of God may in his own sense be very near to perishing, and yet must not in the most desperate condition cease to pray, nor cease to hope for delivery prayed for: <hi>Save me, O God.</hi> 2. With danger of bodily death, a childe of God may have in his spirit a sore conflict with the sense of wrath, like to swallow up his soul, as deep waters do a drowning man; <hi>The waters are come in unto my soul.</hi> 3, The condition of a soul exercised with the sense of wrath, threateneth no lesse then perdition, certain, inevitable, without any event, and endlesse; whereof the bodily danger of a drowning man is but a shadow: <hi>I sink in deep mire, where there is no standing: I am come into deep waters, where the floods overflow me.</hi>

                  </q>
                  <p>The second reason of the first Petition is, because he had long and patiently waited on God. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. Faith in hard exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences doth not give over for appearances of perdition, knowing that what is impossible to mans appearance, is not impossible to God; for <hi>David,</hi> as a believer, and a type of Christ, prayeth still for all this, although he finde no delivery: <hi>I am weary of my crying.</hi> 2. Prayer put up in faith to God, keepeth in life, and is like a mans drawing breath in the water when the head is lift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up above the floods; for here, although the floods over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowed the <hi>Psalmist,</hi> yet he is able to shew this to God, and to cry till he be <hi>weary of crying.</hi> 3. For exercising of faith, and making patience to have the perfect work, it is no strange thing for God to delay relief unto an earnest supplicant, till he be like to give over, till his case seem desperate, and his relief hopelesse; <hi>Mine eyes faile, while I wait for my God.</hi> 4. Though the flesh of the regenerate man be weak, yet the spirit is ready, and will never give over calling on God, depending on him, holding fast the Covenant, and the hope of deliverance; for it will make this a new ground of speech unto God, that it is no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <p>The second Petition is, that the godly may not be hurt by his manner of exercise, which he strengthens by four reasons; Frst, because his sufferings were for Gods cause, <hi>ver.</hi> 7. Secondly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he was cast off by his friends, <hi>ver.</hi> 8. Thirdly, because he did take Gods honour deeply to heart, <hi>ver.</hi> 9.

Faith sets its eyes in prayer upon those titles of God, which do serve most for its purpose; as here the <hi>Psalmist</hi> hath to do with enemies, <hi>O Lord God of Hosts,</hi> will do his turn against them; he is praying for the good of Gods children, and, <hi>O God of Israel, speaketh to that point.</hi>

                  <p>The second petition is more special, for safety and delivery from his enemies. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. The righteousnesse of God is a pawne unto the godly, that their lawful petitions shall be granted, and specially when they seek delivery from their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly adversaries; <hi>Deliver me in thy righteousnesse, and cause me

                  <p>In the latter part of the Psalm, is the <hi>Psalmists</hi> confidence to be delivered, set forth in four evidences thereof. The first is his resolution to persevere in hope to be helped, and in praising of God, and relying only on the Lords power and righteousnesse, and not on his own strength. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. He that is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved to persevere in hope, may be sure of a gracious event out of his trouble: <hi>But I will hope continually.</hi> 2. Resolute hope comforteth, enlargeth, and stirreth up the heart unto more and more praising and thanksgiving; <hi>I will hope continually, and I will yet praise thee more and more.</hi> 3. The matter of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:66460:75"/>
praise of God, is partly his righteousnesse, whereby he keepeth his promise, not only according, but also above conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and giveth also remission of sins, which did deserve wrath, and partly his deliverances, which he giveth to his children, out of danger of body and soul; <hi>My mouth shall shew forth thy righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse, and thy salvation all the day; for I know not the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers thereof.</hi> 5. Because in troubles a mans own strength will fail him, and fail him also in commanded duties, therefore the believer must renounce confidence in his own ability in both ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, and lean to the furniture of God; <hi>I will go in the strength of the Lord God.</hi> 6. Because the conscience of sins and sinfulness still doth stare the Believer in the face, and all to discourage him; the Believer must renounce all confidence in his own holinesse, and relie upon the imputed righteousnesse of Christ onely, which is called the righteousnesse of God by saith, being witnessed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to both by the Law and Prophets, <hi>Rom. 3. 21.

                  <p>The second evidence of the Prophets confidence to be deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, is the experience of Gods kindnesse for time past, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king him with comfortable assurance of being heard to pray for the continuance of that same kindnesse for time to come. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1.

                  <p>The third evidence of his confidence to be delivered, is his looking to the unsearchable fountain of Gods wisdom, faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and omnipotency, and his expecting from this well-spring, that as large consolation shall come forth to him, as he hath had a large measure of troubles. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. Albeit the effects of Gods wisdome, faithfulnesse, and omnipotency, be neer unto us, and do fall under our sense in his daily operations, yet the fountain thereof, which is Gods own perfect on, is unsearchable, incomprehensible, and incomparably great; <hi>Thy righteousnesse, O God, is very high, who hast done great th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

That which we see of the Lords works, may lead us up to know what is not seen in relation to difficulties, and power of men, and to see what he is able to do; and when we see the invisible God, we cannot choose but admire his Majesty, and exalt him as Sovereign over all, and then, and not till then that we give him the honour of omnipotency and faithfulnesse, can the heart rest and be quiet: <hi>Thy righteousnesse, O God, is very high, who hast done great things: who is like to thee?</hi> 3. He tha acknowledgeth Gods justice and wisdome in his troubles, may look to see Gods power and grace no lesse evident in his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livery
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:66460:76"/>
and consolation: and he who in trouble hath seen his own infirmity, emptinesse, and death, may look to see Gods power and life in raising of him out of the grave of his trouble; <hi>Thou which hast shewed me great and sore troubles, shalt quicken me again, and shalt bring me up again from the depths of the earth.</hi> 4 As trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble humbleth and abaseth a man before the world: so the Lords delivering of him, and shewing his respect to him, honoureth the man again, and exalteth him before men; <hi>Thou shalt increase my greatnesse.</hi> 5. As no trouble doth come alone, but multitudes of troubles joyned together, when the Lord will humble and try a man; so no comfort cometh single or alone, when the Lord will change the mans exercise, but a multitude of comforts joyned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; <hi>Thou wilt comfort me on every side.</hi> 6. Losses are made lighter, and comforts weightier, when God is seen and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged in them: <hi>Thou which hast shewed me sore troubles,</hi> (it is but a view of trouble what we have felt when troubles are seen to come from Gods hand,) <hi>thou shalt increase my greatnesse, and comfort me on every side.</hi>

                  <p>The fourth and last evidence of his confidence, is his promise of joyful thanksgiving, by way of a begun song, and that for the foresight of his own delivery, and of his enemies overthrow. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. Faith is so satisfied with Gods promise, that it can praise heartily for what is promised, before it finde perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance: <hi>I will praise thee with the Psaltery, even thy truth.</hi> 2. It is our interest in the Covenant, which makes us to have interest in particular promises; <hi>I will praise thy truth, O my God.</hi> 3. A soul sensible of Gods kindnesse, and sure by faith of the perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of his faithful promises, cannot satisfy it selfe in praising of God, it hath so high estimation of his fidelity, power, and love: Therefore after he hath said, <hi>I will praise thee,</hi> he addeth,

                     <hi>unto thee will I sing with the Harp.</hi> 4.

Singing with our voice unto the Lord, is a part of moral worship, as well as prayer with the voice, when his honour, and our upstirring, and others edifying calleth for it; <hi>My lips shall greatly rejoyce when I sing unto thee.</hi> 6.

Dangers and distres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, how grievous soever they be for the time, yet do they furnish matter of praise to God, and joy to the party troubled afterward when the delivery cometh: <hi>My lips shall rejoyce, and my so<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>al answer given here to the Churches prayer, promiseth above twenty benefits of Christs government<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> all of them tending to the glory of the King, and good of the subjects; the shadow whereof was to be seen in <hi>David,</hi> and <hi>Solomons</hi> reign, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>oyned with many imperfections; but the real accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is onely in Christ. The first is, Christs subjects shall have good rules how to carry themselves in all duties, how to behave themselves righteously, and how to be made righteous, by his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection and conduct; <hi>He shall judge thy people with righteousnesse.</hi> The second benefit or commendation is, Christ will see the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>

supplied most discreetly, and the wrongs done unto them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired; <hi>He shall judge thy poor with judgement, ver.</hi> 3. The third benefit is, Christ is not to take away civil Governours, nor Potentates places, nor the several orders and ranks of greatnesse of superiour and inferiour powers, Rulers and Judges; all these are to be fixed rather by him, for the good of the people: The superiour as <hi>mountains,</hi> and the inferiour as <hi>little hills,</hi> shall stand in their place for him. The fourth benefit is, Christ sha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>l make such Magistrates as do embrace him, for their Lord and Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, a blessing to the people under them; for by their righteous government the people shall live quier and safe in Gods service under them: <hi>The mountains shall bring peace to the people, and the little hills;</hi> but how shall the mountaines and little hills do this? <hi>By righteousnesse, ver.</hi> 4 The fifth benefit is, albeit Christ do suffer his subjects to be brought low in the sense of their own weaknesse, and in danger of being swallowed up by their perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors, yet shall he take their controversie to his cognition, and deliver his people out of the hands of their adversaries: <hi>He shall judge the poor of the people: he shall save the children of the needy; he shall break in pieces the oppressors, ver.</hi> 5. The sixth benefit, Christ the true King of <hi>Israel,</hi> shall never want a kingdome, he shall never want subjects, but shall alwayes have a Church of such as shall worship and fear him, and do homage unto him, so long as the world doth stand, amidst all changes and revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that can come: <hi>They shall fear thee as long as the Sunne and Moon endure, throughout all generations. ver.</hi> 6. The seventh benefit, whatsoever sad condition his people shall be in, how farre soever spoiled of their lust<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>e and glory in the world, or in any other respects whatsoever, they shall be made as a mowen down medow possibly; yet Christ by his Word, Spirit, and effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al blessing shall revive and recover them: as grasse cut down being watered by rain, is made to grow again: <hi>He shall come down like rain upon the mowen grasse, as showers that water the earth, ver.</hi> 7. The eight benefit, all the true subjects of Christ are justified persons, and devoted in their hearts to righteousnesse, in the obedience of Gods will, and such as do endeavour to abound in the fruits of righteousnesse: <hi>The righteous shall flourish in his dayes.</hi> The ninth benefit, Christs justified subjects and students of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, shal have peace with God, peace abounding and passing all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding, <hi>lasting peace,</hi> without end, in all revolution of conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, <hi>The righteous s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        </gap>al flourish, &amp; have abundant peace, so long as the world endureth. v.</hi> 1. The tenth benefit of Christs government, is
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:66460:78"/>
the enlargement of the Church, and number of his subjects, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the length and breadth of Gods promises made to his people <hi>Israel,</hi> whether <hi>Israel</hi> in the letter, or in the Spirit: <hi>He shall have dominion also from sea to sea, and from the river unto the ends of the earth, ver.</hi> 9. The eleventh benefit of Christs go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment is more special; whomsoever he pleaseth to make sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects unto himselfe, how wilde and savage soever they be, yea how great enemies soever they have been to his Kingdome, he shall tame them, bring them in subjection to himselfe, and to most humble submission unto his commands: <hi>They that dwell in the wildernesse shall bow before him, and his enemies shall lick the dust, ver.</hi> 10. The twelfth benefit is yet more special; The Kings and Rulers of the Gentiles shall finde it a blessing to themselves, and to their dominions, to be under Christs go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and shall effectually contribute their riches, power, and authority, to advance the Kingdome of Christ, their sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Lord and protector: <hi>The kings of Tarshish, and of the Isles shall bring presents: the kings of Sheba and Seba shall offer gifts, ver</hi> 11. The thirteenth benefit. of Christs government, is so great an enlargement of his Kingdome, by bringing of all King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes and Nations someway under his Scepter, that the Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of <hi>Iohn</hi> the Divine, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. 15. shall be acknowledged to be fulfilled; <hi>All the kingdomes of the earth are become the Lords and his Sonne Christs,</hi> how improbable soever this may seem: for answerably hereunto is it said here, <hi>Yea all kings shall f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        </gap>ll down before him, all nations shall serve him, ver.</hi> 12. The fourteenth benefit serving for the commendation of his government, is by way of giving a reason of the marvellous enlargement of his Kingdome, from his care of the meanest of his subjects, from his effectual pity toward them, love and estimation of them. The care Christ hath of his subjects is such, that the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>e is not one so mean in all his Kingdome, of whom, and whose necessities, and of whose particular petitions he doth not take most particular and exact knowledge, whose petitions being presented in the sense of their need, he doth not grant: <hi>He shall deliver the needy, when he crieth.</hi> There needeth no Mediator be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>ween him and his sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects; <hi>He heareth the needy when they cry.</hi> The man that hath nothing within him or without him to commend him to Christ, to assist, help, relieve, or comfort him in heaven or earth, is not despised by Christ, but delivered from that which he fe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>reth: <hi>He shall deliver the poor also, and him that hath no helper;</hi> and this he doth by teaching his subjects to bear troubles, by strengthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:66460:79"/>
them for the burden; by comforting them in their grief; by gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a delivery to their spirits by faith, and a full delivery at last, <hi>v</hi> 13. The fifteenth benefit and commendation of Christs govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he doth not exact any thing of his subjects, but that which he offereth to furnish and enable them to discharge: he lets none be tempted above his strength; he taketh small be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings in good part, he spareth the rod in a great measure, mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigates the correction, and in midst of wrath he remembereth mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy: <hi>He shall spare the poor and needy;</hi> whatsoever hard exercise he put them to, he will give them their soul for a prey: They shall not perish, who in the sense of their need depend upon him: <hi>He shall save the souls of the needy, ver.</hi> 14. The sixteenth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit and commendation of Christs Kingdome, albeit the Lord suffer his subjects to be tried with heresies and seducers, by op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressors and persecutors, yet he will assist them in the trial and bring them out of it: <hi>He shall redeem their soule from deceit and violence,</hi> and if for his own glory he put any of them to lay down their life for his cause, it shall be a point of special ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouring of them, as of precious sonnes, whom he esteemeth much of, both living and dead; <hi>Precious shall their blood be in his sight, v.</hi> 15. The seventeenth benefit and commendation of Christs go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment is from his everlasting indurance; albeit other Kings die, and leave their kingdom to their successor, yet it is not so with Christ, he indureth for ever: his death for paying the ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som of our sins, did not interrupt his reign, but made way for his more glorious reigning, after his resurrection; he hath life in himselfe, as in the fountain; <hi>He shall live,</hi> he shall live conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and bringing in moe subjects, who shall pay tribute unto him; <hi>To him shall be given of the gold of Sheba.</hi> The eighteenth benefit and commendation of Christs Kingdom is this, Christ shall be well beloved of all his subjects, whose exercise it shall be to wish and pray for the prosperity of his Kingdome, Church, and mystical body, and who shall commend and praise his glorious and lovely Majesty; <hi>Prayer also shalll be made for him continually, and daily shall he be praised, v.</hi> 16. The nineteenth benefit &amp; commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of Christs government is, that a little seed of his preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Word sowen among men, of whose conversion there might be least hope, like a handful of corn sowen upon the mountaines or most barren ground, shall have a glorious increase of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version of many notable Saints, like as corn in a barren place should grow up like Cedar-trees; <hi>There shall be an handful of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

like Lebanon:</hi> and this blessing of the Gospel he can make it to be without prejudice of the manured land of Churches al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready planted, which are as cities inhabited; those he can blesse and will blesse at his pleasure, with the abundant growth of grace amongst them; <hi>And they of the City shall flourish as the grasse of the earth,</hi> ver. 17. The last commendation and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of Christs government, summeth up all that can be said in these foure generals; 1. That Christs Name, fame and honour, shall be perpetuated from one generation to another, for the run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of his benefits to his subjects, and for the course of his judgements on his enemies: <hi>His name shall endure for ever; his Name shall be continued as long as the Sun.</hi> 2. His Gospel shall spread further and further among men, to deliver his own from the curse due for sin, to make them partakers of the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of full felicity; <hi>Men s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        </gap>all be blessed in him.</hi> 3 It shall be in vain to seek blessednesse any where, except in him only, who is the procurer, applier and maintainer of true blessednesse; the way whereunto is, to come to God in and through Christ: <hi>In him men shall be blessed.</hi> And 4. Such a fulnesse of converted Gentiles at length shall be brought in, that the blessednesse of the Gospel of Christ, and of spiritual communion with him, and the riches of his goodnesse and grace shall generally be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged in all the world; <hi>All Nations shall call him blessed.</hi>

And next, it serveth to shew, that in this answer made to his prayer set down in this Psalme, all his desires were granted, both concerning himself and his house; for he could wish no more. And thirdly, it serveth to shew his mean esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of himself, notwithstanding of the Lords lifting of him up so high, that so the grace of God in him may be the more conspicuous; for which causes he calleth himself, <hi>The sonne of</hi> Jesse. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1.

The meditation of Christ, contemplation of his glory, seeking af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and foreseeing the inlargement of Christs Kingdom, is a noble and comfortable closing of a mans life, as here we see it. 3. It is the note of true humility and sincere love to God, to abase our selves, and acknowledge our low condition, wherein God did finde us when he did let forth his love to us, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we may commend the riches of Gods goodnesse and grace un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us, as appeareth here in <hi>David.</hi>

Next, with this tentation he wrestles, <hi>ver.</hi> 15, 16. And thirdly he getteth the victory, by consulting the Word of God, <hi>ver.</hi> 17, 18, 19, 20. In the last place, he maketh a fourefold use of this experience; the first whereof is, the acknowledging of his own weaknesse under the tentation, <hi>ver.</hi> 21, 22.

                  <p>What was the prosperity of the wicked, which stumbled him, he setteth down in particular inthese verses, <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit the great multitude of the wicked are subject to such out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward miseries, as others are, yet to some of them, yea and to some of the worst of them, God for his own holy ends useth to give health of body, long life, little sicknesse, and a quiet death, when the time of it is come, and in their death to keep them from many troubles, which others are subject unto: and yet God doth not love them, nor approve any whit more of them for this: <hi>There are no bands in their death, but their strength is firme; they are not in trouble as other men, &amp;c.</hi> 2. The more liberally the Lord deals with the wicked, they are the more insolent and proud, and vain-glorious; they are the more unjust and violent oppressors of others: their prosperity doth blinde them, and serveth to encrease their wickednesse; <hi>Therefore pride compasseth them as a chaine; violence covereth

them as a garment.</hi> They glory in their oppression. 3. Albeit God bestow riches on the wicked, and more then they could rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonably wish, and do give them health of bodies to make use of their riches as they please, so as they swell for fatnesse, (which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance should oblige a man to serve the Lord more heartily) yet the recompence they render to God is this, they become more and more vicious in their own persons, and do threaten more and more injuries to their neighbours; <hi>They are corrupt, and speak wickedly concerning oppression:</hi> They stand in awe neither of God nor man, but openly in their, speeches they despise all authority over them; <hi>They speak loftily:</hi> They scoffe and mock religion, and speak blasphemously of God and his providence: <hi>They set their mouth against the Heavens:</hi> They speak as they please of all things, and all men, not caring against whom they speak, or what they speak to any mans pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice; <hi>Their tongue walketh through the earth:</hi> not caring whom it tread upon, or whom it abuse. 4. The prosperity of the wicked, and their thriving in an ill course, doth ensnare ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny inconsiderate people, even members of the visible Church, and moveth them to follow the evil wayes of the openly wicked, and to make defection from their own professed duties; <hi>There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his people return hither,</hi> saith he. 5. When men stumble at righteousness because of trouble, and follow the course of the wicked for love of worldly advantage; it is righteousness with God, to give both the bait for a while to such changelings, and the hook also, for hardening them in their own wicked choice; <hi>And waters of a full Cup</hi> (saith he) <hi>are wrung out unto them:</hi> that is, they finde some worldly commodity by their defection. 6.

When men are once insnared in an ill course, they will seek reasons to justifie themselves; those thoughts which did insnare them, do also hold them; for they to whom <hi>waters of a full Cup are wrung out, do say, How doth God know?</hi> 2. Men are ready to reproach the Lord, if he do not guide the world to their fancy, yea and to blaspheme God, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then blame themselves for their faults, as these words do import: <hi>How doth God know?</hi> that is, how can it be, that God taketh notice of such mens wayes as wrong, seeing he doth prosper them? 3. To think that God is well-pleased with the way of the wicked, because they prosper; and that he respects not his Saints, because he doth afflict them more then the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, is as much as in effect to say, The Lord is not wise that doth so well to his foes, and dealeth so hardly with his friends; for so here is it interpreted by the Lord: <hi>Is there knowledge in the most High?</hi> 4. It seemeth very reasonable to carnal reason, that if God hate ungodlinesse, he should not suffer the ungodly to prosper in the world: and if he will suffer them to prosper, then he doth not hate ungodlinesse; and therefore when it is clear to all men that the ungodly do prosper, they conclude <hi>that God knoweth not;</hi> taketh no notice of ungodlinesse, or is not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleased with it, for here is their proof; <hi>Behold,</hi> (say they) <hi>these are the ungodly who prosper in the world, they increase in riches.</hi> 5. The thing that deceiveth the ungodly and the misbelieving world about Gods dispensation, is, that they look only to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

The true course of sanctification con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists in the study of cleansing a man from all pollution both of soul and body, or <hi>in cleansing the heart and the hands,</hi> as here is set down: The heart is cleansed by the blood of the expiatory sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice laid hold on by faith, and by the begun works of the Lords Spirit manifested in the hearty resolution, purpose and study of holinesse the hands are cleansed by a blameless and harmless con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation or course of life and actions: <hi>I have cleansed my heart and hands in innocency.</hi> 3. When a man is under a tentation, or in a fleshly temper of spirit, for the present he putteth a high price upon any good he hath done, and forgetteth by what strength he did it; he forgetteth Gods part, and his glory in it; for the Psalmists part, was the consenters part, the instruments part, and he was in the point of action only a subordinate a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent and co-worker at the best by a borrowed strength; and yet as if all the work had been his work alone; <hi>In vain</hi> (saith he) <hi>have I cleansed my heart, and washed my hands in innocency.</hi> 4 That which is the break-neck of the wicked, may readily be a stum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling-stone for a time to the godly: that which is the irreco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verable deadly sickness of the wicked, may be the hot fever or distemper of the godly for a season. In special, as the wicked man at all times doth look only to this present world, and to what may make him prosperous or miserable in this present life: so it may befal the godly man also in a fit, at a time, to look only upon temporal prosperity and trouble, as here we see the Psalmist looketh only to his present troubles; <hi>For all the day long I have been plagued;</hi> never a word here of his sweet consolations and

The way to take up and decipher Satans tentations, is to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider what they aim at, tend unto, drive at, what may be the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence thereof; <hi>If I say, I will speak thus,</hi> then such a thing will follow. 3. So long as a tentation remaineth under dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute, and is not come to a setled decree and resolved practice, it hath not obtained full victory; it is with the Psalmist here, for all that was suggested and seemingly yielded, no more yet, but, <hi>If I say I will speak thus.</hi> 4.

begotten of him, by his Word and Spirit, and do resemble their Father in wisdom and righteousnesse; so doth the Psalmist stile them, in the time of his hard exercise here, <hi>The generation of Gods children.</hi> 6. In our disputing with tentations by the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons of reason, we shall do well to make God Moderator of the disputants, and to look to God in our reasoning, that we may by his testimonies rectifie every thing, lest we reason amisse, as here the Psalmist doth; <hi>I should offend against the generation of thy children.</hi> 6.

The Lord hath revealed in Scripture what shall be the end and close of mens course, who studie not to walk according to his direction, how prosperous soever they may seem to be: and because the felicity of men is not to be known by Gods outward dispensation of worldly comforts or crosses, therefore the mans end must put the difference; <hi>Then understood I their end.</hi> 4. Whatsoever alterations and changes the godly man be subject unto in his temporal condition, bodily or spiritual, yet his felicitie is setled unto him on the rock but <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 word">

Whatsoever may seem to the wicked them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, or to the world, or to the godly who look upon the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, how little appearance soever there be of their fall; yet it is decreed it shall be; for notwithstanding of all appearance it is said, <hi>Surely thou hast set them in slippery places.</hi> 6. As the wicked do not arise unto any greatnesse or power in the world by themselves, but the Lord is he that setteth them up for his own glory; so they do not fall of their own accord, but the Lord doth cast them down: beside their own weight, they have the throw of the right hand of the Lord, who sheweth his power in their overthrow, and doth drive them to more deaths then one; <hi>Thou castest them down into destruction.</hi> 7. The wicked perish suddenly, when neither they themselves nor others are looking for their ruine, in a way much more wonderful then their lifting up was; <hi>They are destroyed, how are they brought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to desolation, as in a moment?</hi> 8. The destruction of the wicked is full of terror; how senselesly soever some of them go away, all their riches, honour and prosperity is pulled from them, and in great wrath they are sent out of the world, never to see any token of favour again; they are adjudged to irrecoverable per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of soul and body for ever: <hi>They are utterly consumed with terrors.</hi> 9. When the wicked are flourishing in wealth, ease and honour, men do think that God is as it were sleeping; but the truth is, both the wicked themselves, and all who look upon them, and do judge them to be happy, are in a dream, as they shall see when the Lords time is come to execute judgement on them; for then all their riches, honour, pleasure and content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment shall be found nothing but a despicable picture of these things; <hi>As a dream when one awaketh: so, O Lord, when thou awakest, thou shalt despise their image.</hi>

Albeit the Lord doth seem to turn his back, &amp; depart far away from his own people, when they do provoke him to anger, and to let their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies do unto them, what they please; yet will he be entreated by
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:66460:88"/>
his people to come again, and see, and pity the desolation brought upon them, and punish the instruments of it; <hi>Lift up thy feet unto the perpetual desolations:</hi> that is, Lord, come speedily, and see what desolations thy enemies have made amongst us, and pity and relieve us by thy manifested presence. 3. Among all the calamities of Gods people, nothing doth afflict them so much, as the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

When the wicked are le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap> loose upon Gods people, they are most insolent, cruel and savage in their carriage toward them; <hi>Thy enemies roare in the midst of thy congregations.</hi> 5. It will not suffice the enemies of the Church to insult over Gods people, but they will insult over their way of religion, and over God whom they worship; <hi>They set up their ensignes for signes;</hi> they display their banner upon the ruines of the Temple, as signes of their victory over that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion which is professed there, and over Gods worship there<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 6. When Gods people do abuse religion, and do mock God in their profession of worship, and do dishonour him by their carriage and conversation; it is justice with God to give over his people, and all the meanes of religion into the hands of his enemies, to be abused by them, rather then to suffer his own people to mock him continually, as in this example is to be seen. 7. It is a matter of a mans commendation, to contribute any way to the setting up of Gods worship and ordinances in a land; <hi>A man was famous according as he had lifted up axes upon the thick trees:</hi> that is, as he had cut down timber out of <hi>Lebanon</hi> Wood, to build the Lords Temple withall. 8. When the Lord is provoked by his peoples evil carriage towards him, no wonder he let the work of edification or reformation of religion go as fast down amongst them, as ever it rose up, as the Church of the Jewes did feel by experience, when <hi>now the enemies did break down the carved work of the Temple at once, with axes and hammers,</hi> much more speedily then it was builded; <hi>They have cast fire into the Sanctua<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                           <desc>•…</desc>
                        </gap>y, they have defiled by casting down the dwelling place of thy Name to the ground.</hi> This the Lord chused to permit, rather then to suffer his people still to mock religion, and still to abuse the Temple, and make it a shelter for them to trust in against all Gods threatnings, so long as it did stand. 9. Albeit the Lords minde be onely to correct his people, by letting them see their provocation in the judgements brought upon them: yet the
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:66460:89"/>
enemies whom he useth as instruments in their correction, do minde their utter destruction, and the rooting of them out of the world: <hi>They said in their hearts, Let us destroy them.</hi> 10. When the enemies of religion cannot kill all the worshippers of God, yet will they labour to mar the means of their assembling for publick worship, so farre as they can: for after they have said, <hi>Let us destroy them together,</hi> it is subjoyned, <hi>They have burnt up all the Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues of God in the land:</hi> that is, all the houses built for the weekly assembling of the people unto publick worship, in their several divisions, through the land. 11. Houses built for meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Lords people to publick worship, albeit they be not ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pically holy, as the Temple of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> was; yet do they belong to God, as meanes dedicate for maintaining his service, and when they are marred, it is a wrong done to God, and a cause of complaint to God against the sacrilegious spoilers thereof, as here we see. 12. External troubles are much lighter, when the publick ordinances and signes of Gods presence in a land may be had for spiritual comfort; but when those are removed, every trouble is the more heavy: <hi>We see not our fignes, there is no more any Prophet, ne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

If it be asked, how can this be applied unto the time of the captivity, seeing <hi>Ieremy, Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiel, Daniel,</hi> and the Prophet who did write this Psalme by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiration, were living at the beginning of the captivity, and after the burning of the Temple? It may be answered, that <hi>Ieremy</hi> was carried away <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

be ere the Temple should be builded again; and the Prophet, by whom this Psalm was endited, had no further commission then he speaketh of; and so these foresaid expressions, may stand with the time of the beginning of the captivity of <hi>Babylon.</hi>

The Lords long-suffering patience doth greatly harden the adversaries in their insolent mocking of Gods people; for instead of saying, Lord, how long wilt thou bear with them? he saith, <hi>O God, how long shall the adversaries reproach?</hi> 3. The truly godly can endure their own troubles better then they can bear the open dishonouring and blaspheming of God, by occasion of their trouble: Therr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this expression, from the deepest sense of his heart, doth break forth, <hi>Shall the enemy blaspheme thy Name for ever?</hi> 4. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit tentations from carnal sense do represent God as if he were idle when he suffers his enemies to trample on his people, and on his glorious Name; yet faith will not admit of such a thought, but dealeth with God by prayer, to let his strength and power be so manifest, that the world may not think his hand is in his bosome; <hi>Why withdrawest thou thy hand, even thy right band? pluck it out of thy bosome.</hi> This he believeth the Lord shall do, and giveth reasons for his hope, in that which followeth.</p>

The more time is past since God did avow himselfe King of his Church, the more confident may later generations of the Church be to finde new evidences of his royal actions for them, and against their enemies; <hi>God is my King of old.</hi> 3. New troubles must not make us forget old mercies, but rather call them to memory, to be made use of afresh as pledges that what he hath done before, he will do the like again; <hi>God is my King of old, working salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the earth:</hi> that is, such deliverances of his Church, as all the earth was witnesse of. 4. The delivery of <hi>Israel</hi> out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and the destruction of the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> is a pawn unto the Church in every age after, that God will destroy their enemies how strong and terrible soever they be, and will deliver his Church: <hi>Thou didst divide the sea by thy strength, thou brakest the heads of the Dragons in the waters.</hi> 5. As all the enemies of the Church are no lesse cruel and savage against the Lords peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, then unreasonable Sea-beasts, and Sea-monsters: so can he make their carcases a prey to unreasonable beasts, as he made <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh</hi>

The Lord will not fail to provide consolation to his Church in her necessity, though no probable means do appear, as he fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished his people drink from the flinty rock in the wildernesse: <hi>Thou didst cleave the fountain.</hi> 7. The Lord can and will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move all difficulties and impediments out of the way of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, which may hinder them from the possession of promises, as he did to <hi>Israel: Thou didst cleave the fountain and the flood, thou driedst up mighty rivers.</hi> 8. Faith is so thrifty, as not to let the works of creation, and common providence passe by, without use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>making thereof: <hi>The day is thine, the night also is thine, &amp;c.</hi> 9. As God hath appointed vicissitudes of day and night, light and darknesse, summer and winter; so hath he no lesse resolvedly, wisely, and graciously appointed vicissitudes of dangers and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verances, of grief and consolation to his people, for their good: <hi>The day is thine, the night also is thine: thou hast prepared the light and the Sun.</hi> 10. As the Lord hath set bounds to the sea, bounds and borders to every Kingdome, to summers heat, and to win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters cold: so can he do, and so hath he done, and so will he do unto all the troubles of his owne, to all the rage, power, plots and purposes of their enemies: <hi>Thou hast set all the borders of the earth, thou hast made summer and winter,</hi>

All sins, but in special blasphemy of Gods Name, are aggravated by the naughtiness of the sinner, and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of God: <hi>The foolish people have blasphemed thy Name.</hi> 3. The Church of God, in comparison of her many and strong enemies, is like a solitary, weak, desolate turtle-dove, harmlesse, meek, lowly, patient in desolation, and easing her griefe by sighing, and exposed to a multitude of ravenous birds; <hi>O deliver not the soule of thy turtle-dove.</hi> 4. How weak soever the Church be, and how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and strong soever the enemies be, yet cannot they all devoure the Church, except the Lord should deliver his Church over into their hands, against which evill the Church hath ground of confidence to pray, <hi>O deliver not the soule of thy turtle-love unto the multitude of the wicked;</hi> for he hath given his Church wings, and a hiding place too, as the comparison importeth, if he please to give her the use thereof also. 5.

Such places as want the light of the Lords presence in his Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, are but dark and uncomfortable places, where there is no lesse hazard for the people of God to remaine, then for sheep to be in the midst of the dennes of cruel lions and ravenous beasts: And when it pleaseth God to cast his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple

The sense of need and emptinesse, is the best disposition for prayer, and best preparation for praises also: and such as are poore in their prayers, shall be rich in their praises; <hi>Let the poor and needy praise thy Name.</hi> 10. The Churches cause is the Lords cause; for the wicked do not maligne the godly for their sinnes, but for righteousnesse, and so the quarrel is the Lords, which he will and must maintain, though he seem to sit still a while: <hi>Arise, O Lord, plead thine owne cause.</hi> 11. The Lords enemies are all foolish men; for they beat out their braines upon the Churches bulwark; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Lord forbeareth for a time, they go on to blaspheme him daily to his face, but shall finde at length that God hath all their reproaches upon record: <hi>Remember how the foolish man reproacheth thee daily.</hi> 12.

It is possible that the matter of most comfort at some time may give no ease; the sweet promises of grace, when a soul is not able to apply them; yea the thought of God himselfe, and his goodnesse, may augment grief, when the conscience doth present his abused savours, as the c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

It is a third holy meanes for deliverance from the straits of a troubled conscience, to search our wayes, and to seek out diligently, what cause in us we can finde, which might pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure such a de sertion and sense of wrath, as we do lie under; <hi>I communed with my own heart, and my spirit made diligent search.</hi> 5. Albeit it be possible when all the former meanes are used, and diligent search is made by our conscience, what may be the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of our hard exercise, that for all that, we finde no consolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, no ease, nor event; yet the use of these meanes will wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse for our wise and upright dealing, and be evidences of our endeavour and diligence in duties, as here we see the Prophet to make mention of his diligence for this end. 6. Albeit it be no strange thing for a wounded spirit to have suggestions cast in for overthrow of saith, yea to have sense of wrath, speaking no lesse then what the tentation unto desperation doth alledge; yet the nature of faith is such, that it cannot yield, but must fight against the tentation, as a thing which cannot be true, cannot be admitted, as this disputation of the <hi>Psalmist</hi> doth give evidence; <hi>Will the Lord cast off for ever? and will he be favourable no more?</hi> 7. The Lord may seem to cast a m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>n off, and to stop the
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:66460:100"/>
course of his wonted favour toward him, but this exercise is only for a time: It is not possible that God should cast off for ever the soul that cannot endure to be thrust from him: It is not pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible that God should not be favourable to such as have had expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of his favour, and do long to have new proofes thereof: <hi>Wil the Lord cast off for ever? will he be favourable no more?</hi> Which question, <hi>Will he do so and so?</hi> is thus much in effect, as if he had said, it is not possible that the Lord should do so, albeit it seem he will do so. 8. When the conscience of sin doth make obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction against faith, then faith makes its defence in Gods mercy, and the constancy of the course of mercy, where grace is begun to runne; yea faith will not yield to a contrary thought: <hi>Is his mercy clean gone for ever.</hi> 9. The troubled conscience hungering af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the sense of mercy, hath not onely Gods merciful nature: and Gods constancy in his good will, but also his promises to lean unto, for supporting of it selfe. Therefore after mentio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap> made of Gods favour and mercy, he mentioneth here his <hi>promise</hi> also. 10 It is possible, that for a time no promise do occurre to a wounded spirit, which is fit for its present condition; or at least, no promise, which it dare or is able to apply, yea it is possible that the conditional frame of the promises being made to such as are so and so qualified, may seem to pertain nothing to the troubled conscience, yet faith will not quit its interest in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>promise, but will expect good according to the promise at last; <hi>Doth his promise faile for evermore?</hi> 11. As it is the Lords nature to be gracious to such as come to him in the sense of their unworthinesse; so faith layeth hold on him, as gracious, and will never, admit a suggestion of any change in him, whatsoever seem to be in his dispensation; <hi>Hath God forgotten to be gracious?</hi> this is to faith an absurdity and impossibility. 12. The compassions of God toward the miserable when they come before him, are like a running fountain, that cannot restrain it selfe, yet may it seem to be shut up, and wrath and displeasure to run in the place there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, when God is pleased to exercise his childe with the sense of wrath against sin; but faith will not admit this seeming for a certainty: <hi>Hath he in anger shut up his tender mercies?</hi> This is a saying which a Believer must abhorre to give way unto, and yet may be assaulted with, and brangled, and weakened by the tentation of it.</p>

That no soul can be under such sense of wrath and desolation, but he may draw comfort from the great work of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption of lost sinners: for if when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Sonne, much more being reconciled, we shall be saved from wrath by his life.

The fourth, because it must be known and transmitted to the succeeding posterity, and following generations of the Church, for the glory of Gods wonderful working for his Church, <hi>v. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

The Word of the Lord hath true an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity with it; divine doctrine is no new doctrine: and for this reason should we hear it attentively and beleevingly; <hi>I will utter dark sayings of old.</hi> 5. Albeit the Word of the Lord be a mystery, and dark sayings to the misbeleeving multitude of the world, yet it is understood, received and beleeved by the true members of the Church from age to age; therefore the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, speaking of himself, and of the godly in his time, saith of their parables and dark speeches, <hi>Which we have heard and known, and our fathers have told us.</hi> 6.

                  <p>After the Preface, he bringeth forth a notable evidence of the Lords care of his Church, in giving them his Scriptures and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed rule of faith and obedience, to be transmitted from one generation to another, <hi>ver.</hi> 5, 6. that they might have faith and hope in God, and obey his commands, <hi>ver.</hi> 7. and not be like such of their Predecessors, as were rebellious hypocrites, and backsliders from their covenanted duties, <hi>v.</hi> 8. <hi>Whencelearn,</hi> 1. One of the chiefest mercies that can be bestowed on a people, is the giving of the holy Scripture<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap> unto them, and revealing unto them the way of salvation, and of Gods service which he requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth; this is put in the first room here: <hi>For he established a Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony in Iacob, and appointed a Law in Israel.</hi> 2. Gods words and ordinances appointed in Scripture, are witnesses for him, of his wisdom, power, holinesse, mercy, and justice against such as do not make use thereof, and a fixed rule for mens faith and obedience; therefore is it said, <hi>He established a testimony in Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob,
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:66460:105"/>
and appointed a Law in Israel.</hi> 3. The Scriptures were not appointed for a rule only to those to whom they were first di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected, but for the use also of the Church in all ages follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which every man must both study to understand and obey himself, and also teach his children, and those under his charge to understand and obey, according to his place; he gave a testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony and a law to the fathers, <hi>That they should make them known to their children, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

The end of revealing and teaching of Gods Word, is to beget and increase mens faith in God, and dependance upon him, as here is set down: the Word was to be declared to their children, <hi>That they might se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        </gap> their hope in God.</hi> 5. The way to foster saith and hope in God, is to mark and consider and keep in a sanctified memory, how God hath al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>eady confirmed his Word by his works, and by pawnes and pledges, both of his power and purpose to perform what he hath said; therefore doth he joyne unto the duty of set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting their hope in God, the duty of not <hi>forgetting his works;</hi> intimating that if his works were forgotten, his Word would not be beleeved, and faith and hope in God would not remain constantly fixed on God. 6. The faith and hope which God craves of his people to be fixed on him, is such as may bring forth obedience to his precepts: therefore unto hoping in God, and not forgetting his works, he addeth, <hi>But keep his Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments:</hi> So this is the summe of true religion, to have faith in God, upon the termes of grace offered unto us through a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer, and to hope for and expect the accomplishment of all his promises, and to foster our faith and hope by the considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of what he hath done for his people, and uprightly to set our selves to keep his Commandments,. 7. The example of fathers is not to be followed, except wherein they followed the Lord: where their practice is not conformable to Gods Word we must not be like them; therefore saith he, <hi>And might not be as their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers were, stubborn.</hi> 8. This is the natural inclination of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt mankinde, to go on in our finful course obstinately, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever God discharge us: to come contrary to his commands, and flatly to refuse to obey him; and if we at any time seem to do him service, to do it from corrupt principles and for corrupt ends, still remaining unreconciled to him: and whatsoever we tie our elves unto by Covenant, as double-hearted persons, to deal deceitfully therein, and turn back from it: such were all
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:66460:105"/>
the unrenewed Israelites: <hi>A stubborn and rebellious generation, a generation that set not their heart aright, and whose spirit was not stedfast with God.</hi> 9. Nothing is able to bring us off this our natural course and sinful inclination. except faith and hope in God, and obedience to his commands be begun and entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in us by the Word of God, as the connexion of these duties here, and order they are set down in doth teach. 10. The Lord will have his people obediently to hearken to his reproofs, and not reject his yoke, and meekly to submit to his govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and not rebell; to study sincerity of affection toward God, and stedfastnesse in his Covenant, as his condemning these carnal Israelites for the contrary faults doth teach us.</p>

The great work of bodily redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Gods people out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and the spiritual Redemption of his People from the bondage of sin and misery by Christ represented thereby, should be as inducements unto, and props of faith in God, to all who seek life in him, and a sufficient mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive unto love and obedience unto him, to the worlds end; for to this end did he declare his love, care and power to save them who enter in Covenant with him to be his people; <hi>Marvellous things did he, &amp;c.</hi> 2. The works of God done for his people in any former age, do oblige those of that age, and all the succeeding ages to make use thereof, for the increase of faith in God, and of love and obedience to God, and do answerably aggravate the contrary sins, when they are not so made use of; for, <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous things did he in the sight of their fathers;</hi> is the ground of challenging of the posterity for their defection. 3.

As the Lord avoweth his people, and owns their quarrel most openly in the sight of Kings Courts and royal Cities; so should his people avow their loyalty to God before all men: otherwayes, the more evidently God hath appeared for his people, the more heavy is the challenge of unthankful diso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience; as here it is made the challenge of back-sliding <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi> that God in the most open theatre of the Kingdom of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,</hi> (whereby the fame of his works might go into all the world) did work for them and their fathers; <hi>Marvellous things did God for them in the field of Zoan;</hi> from whence passage was to many countreys. 5.

but helpful also to this people, as need requireth; <hi>He made the waters to stand as an heap.</hi> 7.

In the fourth place, he setteth down how the people made no better use of the foresaid mercies, then to tempt God, and to provoke him to wrath, by seeking satisfaction to their carnal lusts, and questioning whether or no God was able to satisfie their desires. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. Unrenewed nature is strongly inclined to meet the Lords goodnesse with more and more ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, and to sin over and over again the same sins, when new benefits and old faults being well considered, might teach more wisdom and thankfulnesse; <hi>They sinned yet more against him.</hi> 2. We are so foolish in our sinning, that we do not consider what we our selves are, how great a majesty we offend, and what may be the consequents thereof; <hi>They sinned yet more by provoking the most High.</hi> O how unreasonable, uncircumspect, undiscreet and blinde fools are men in their sinning! 3. Albeit we have no outward enticements, albeit the place of our so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journing here should warne us as strangers and pilgrims to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stain from fleshly lusts, albeit we have the Word &amp; works of God, as witnesses of God, and evidences of his beholding of us, yet so pregnant are we in wickednesse, so beastly passionate in our carnal affections, and so grosse in Atheisme, that naturally we run on in our own wayes, as the horse rusheth into the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell; <hi>They provoked the most High in the wildernesse.</hi> 4. When God giveth sufficiently to supply necessities, and we seek to satisfie our lusts; when God hath said and done abundantly al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready for evidencing his power, justice, truth and care of our welfare, and we will not rest on him, except he give such other new and extraordinary proofs of his properties, as we do pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe, then do we tempt God, and highly provoke him, by seeking thus to subject him to our direction, will and carnal affections; <hi>And they tempted God in their heart, by asking meat for their lust.</hi> 5. When the sinful motions of the minde and heart are not controlled, the sin will break forth openly to outward acts tending to Gods dishonour, and to the evil ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of others; <hi>They tempted God in their heart,</hi> and then <hi>they spake against God.</hi> 6. Words of misbelief, not disputing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst tentations, but in effect calling in question Gods truth, power, care of us, or his good will to us, are in effect slandering of God, and bearing false witnesse against him; <hi>They spake a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst God: they said, Can God furnish, &amp;c?</hi> 7.

When God is openly disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured, the Lord by open judgement will sanctifie his own Name on the sinner, whatsoever be his priviledge, and though he were never so neer to God in external priviledges; <hi>So a fire was kindled against Iacob, and anger also came up against Israel.</hi> 3. Misbelief is a more grievous sin then men do esteem of it; for it calleth Gods truth, mercy, goodnesse, power, constancy, and all in question, and even his justice amongst the rest, which if the misbeleever did consider, he would not provoke justice against himself by this sin; <hi>Wrath came up against Israel, because they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved

The more meanes, encouragements, helps and props to support a mans faith are furnished of God, the greater is the sinne of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beliefe in him: As the <hi>Israelites</hi> misbelief was the greater, for Gods miraculous bringing of water out of the rock, and Manna from the clouds, as here the <hi>Israelites</hi> misbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief is aggravated thus; <hi>They trusted not in his salvation, though he had commanded the clouds, and rained down Manna.</hi> 6. Man liveth not by bread, but by the efficacious Word of God. It is so easie for God to rain down victuals out of the clouds, as to make them grow out of the ground; let him say the Word, and it is done: <hi>He commanded the clouds, and opened the doores of heaven, and rained down Manna on them to eat.</hi> 7.

It is not any good in the sinner, but pity in God, which is the cause of sparing sinners from present perdition, when they provoke the Lord; <hi>But he being full of compassion forgave their iniquity, and destroyed them not.</hi> 3 The Lord doth evidence his mercy and pity toward sinners, partly by his often sparing to strike, and turning away of his wrath ready to break out against them; and partly by his mitigating his anger, and not suffering it to break out in full force; <hi>Many a time he turned his anger away, and did not stirre up all his wrath.</hi> 4. Let men conceit of their own naturall strength as they list, yet the truth is, their frailty is great; <hi>They are but flesh, and a vapour that passeth away, and cometh not again.</hi> 5.

The oftner sin be repeated, the greater is the provocation; and the greater is the mercy, that so often doth forbear to destroy: and when the frequency of sinning, and frequency of sparing are numbred the reckoning will not be easily ended, nor the number condescended upon; <hi>How oft did they provoke him in the wildernesse?</hi> 7. The sinnes of Gods people do greatly displease him, and that so much the more, as they are oftner repeated and committed contrary to what Gods kindnesse and care requireth of them: <hi>How oft did they provoke him in the wildernesse? and grieve him in the desert?</hi> where God gave his daily presence led them, sed them, and protected them miraculously. 8. Amongst other aggravations of sin, this is not the least, after conviction, and correction, and promise of amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, resolutely to go back again to their vomit; <hi>yea, they urned back, and tempted God,</hi> 9.

Not remembring the Lords Word and Works affectionately, and with purpose, and endevour to make right use thereof, is in the Lords accompt no remembrance of him in effect: for of this people, who could well tell the story of their coming out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and so had a common remembrance thereof, the Lord saith, <hi>They re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred not his hand, nor the day when he delivered them from the enemy.</hi> 4 Signes and wonders once done for confirmation of the doctrine of the true God and his Covenant and true Religion, should su<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

The means of mens life comfort, wealth, and defence can stand them in no stead, when God hath a controversie against them: The Lord can deprive them of the benefit thereof, and turn benefits into the meanes of their grief and vexation, as he did the waters of <hi>Egypt,</hi> which were the meanes of life and wealth unto them: <hi>He turned their rivers into blood, and their floods, that they could not drink.</hi> 2. By what means people do sin and
<pb facs="tcp:66460:112"/>
provoke the Lord to wrath, he can by the same meanes punish them. As the <hi>Egyptians</hi> had defiled their rivers with the blood of the infants of <hi>Israel,</hi> so God did make their river speak their sin, and threaten their death; <hi>He turned their rivers into blood, and their floods, that they could not drink.</hi>

Flies and frogs, and every meanest vermine, are too sore for man, when God doth arm them to avenge his quarrel; <hi>He sent out flies which devoured them, and frogs which destroyed them;</hi> that is, which were about to destroy them, and were able enough for the work, and were acknowledged to be so by the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> who did reckon themselves lost men, if these armies should not be taken off them.</p>
                  <p>From <hi>ver. 46, 47, 48. Learn,</hi> 1. When God is not acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged to be the giver of corn and cattel, and fruits of the ground, by a right using of them, he will be known to be the giver there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, by removing of them; <hi>He destroyed their increase, labour, vines, and cattell.</hi> 2.

                  </p>
                  <p>From <hi>ver. 49. Learn,</hi> 1. The plagues of Gods enemies are out of meer justice, and not from fatherly love, as the strokes of his own chosen are; <hi>He cast upon the Egyptians the fiercenesse of his anger.</hi> 2. Trouble of it selfe is not so heavy, as when indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and wrath is joyned with it, or sendeth it forth; <hi>He cast up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them the fiercenesse of his anger, wrath, and indignation, and trouble.</hi> 3.

When the Lords judgements lighting upon mens houses, cornes cattel, and fruit-trees, do not humble men, the Lord doth make his judgement light upon their own persons; and when lighter judgements on their persons do not yet humble them, then God will destroy their lives, and their last plagues shall be heavier then the first; as here, when for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer plagues did not the turn, the Lord laid aside former pitying

From <hi>ver. 62.

Howsoever the Lords people draw on judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments upon themselves, and deserve to be left in their miseries; yet God of his free and constant love to them, sendeth relief when they least expect, as here is to be seen; when his people is in a most desperate condition, <hi>Then the Lord awaketh.</hi> 2. As people do sleep securely in their sin, when God doth call them to repentance: so it is justice with God to misken them in their calamity, and to be unto them as one asleep, as here he is descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed. 3. God doth not so farre wink at the troubles of his own people, but the cry of their misery, and the insolency of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy against them, will awake him. When <hi>Israel</hi> is now as a lost people, and their enemies have taken Gods Ark, <hi>Then the Lord awaked as one out of sleepe, and like a mighty man that shouted because of wine.</hi> 4. Whatsoever weak similitude the Scripture useth to make us conceive somewhat of the Lords operations, yet must we alwayes think of him, as beseemeth the glory of his majesty, leaving the imperfection of the creature, (from which the similitude is borrowed) as the dregs of the comparison, to rest with the creature it self, as here we are led to do, except we should think blasphemous thoughts of God. 5. Albeit the enemies of Gods people may be at ease, when his people are in trouble, and lying under their feet, yet God will arise in due time and punish them; <hi>The Lord awaked, and smote his enemies in the hinder parts.</hi> 6. The dishonour done to God, and to Gods people, is but for a time, and is shortly removed; but the recompence of the enemie which do dishonour God, is perpetual and everlasting; <hi>He smote his enemies in the hinder parts;</hi> to wit, with Emerods and a bloody flux; <hi>And so he p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

When God doth afflict his people, all their priviledges, and the Religion which they professe, do become contemptible and ridiculous to the ungodly, who do not esteem either of Gods ordinances or of his people, but when they are adorned with outward prosperity. The Lords people were seared and honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by them that were about them, when God did fight for them, and countenanced them; but now they lament, <hi>We are become a reproach to our neighbours, a scorne and derision to them that are round about us.</hi> 3. To be mocked in misery, and specially of them by whom we should be comforted, is amongst the saddest passages of our affliction: Therefore here, is this part of their lamentation set down, after the formerly mentioned misery, as a load above a burden, and that which did imbitter their sorrow most of all, because it did reflect upon their Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, their faith, their interest in God, as if all had been ridiculous.</p>

From the fourth part of the lamentation; <hi>Learn,</hi> 1.

Guilty consciences cannot but apprehend wrath, when their plagues are heavy, yea they cannot escape a conflict with the fear of everlasting wrath, when his hand doth lie long upon them. <hi>How long, Lord? Wilt thou be angry for ever?</hi> 3. When Gods people do fall from their matrimonial Covenant with God, and their heart and eyes do go a whoring after idols, no wonder the Lord be jealous, and his wrath for this be most hot, and be like to devour unto utter destruction: <hi>Shall thy jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousie burne like fire?</hi> 4. Whatsoever hath been our calamity, whosoever have been the instruments of our misery, yea how great soever our provocation of Gods anger hath been: it is wisdome, as to expound all the malice and cruelty of men to be the effects of Gods anger and jealousie, and that his anger and jealousie is kinled by our sinnes: so to runne to God, and lament the whole matter before him, and deprecate his wrath, as the Church doth here; <hi>How long, Lord?

                  <p>In the latter part of the <hi>Psalme</hi> is their prayer; and first, for justice and vengeance on their enemies. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. Albeit it be not lawful for us in our own quarrel to pray against our enemies, yet in the Churches quarrel, in the Lords quarrel it is lawful to pray in general against the incorri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible and desperate enemies of God and his people, as here the Church is taught. 2.

The sense of sin maketh the afflicted to be patient, and submissive unto God without murmuration, and
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:66460:120"/>
their lamentation for their misery doth resolve in prayer, and in a prayer for remission of sin; <hi>O remember not against us former iniquities.</hi> 2. The onely right way to remedy a miserable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, is to sue for remission of sins, and for the renewed evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of reconciliation: for before the Church here do ask any thing for their outward delivery, they pray, <hi>O remember not against us former iniquities.</hi> 3. A peoples long continuance in sin doth furnish ground of fear of the long continuing of begun wrath and judgement upon them, and therefore they pray for the forgetting of their sin, that the quarrel being the judgement may be removed; <hi>O remember not against us our former iniquities.</hi> 4. When warth and justice are like to consume us, and quickly make an end of us, a refuge is open to us in Gods tender mercies, who cannot destroy utterly a sinner fleeing to his mercy; <hi>Let thy tender mercies speedily prevent us, for we are brought very low.</hi> 5. When the Lords people are brought low, let them not look for a lifting up or reliefe, except from God onely, therefore say they, here, <hi>Help us, O Lord.</hi> 6. Such as have laid hold on God for salvation promised in the Covenant, may also look for particular deliveries out of particular troubles, as appendices of the main benefit of salvation; Therefore, <hi>Help, us, O God of our salvation,</hi> say they. 7. When men do ask any thing, the granting whereof may glorify God, they may confidently expect to have it; and in speciall, when God may be so glorified, as his people may also be preserved and comforted: <hi>Help us</hi> (say they) <hi>for the glory of thy Name, and deliver us.</hi> 8. As the consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of sin useth to step in oftner between us and mercy, so must we call oftner for remission of sinne; for earnest affection can double and treble the same Petition without babling: <hi>Deliver us, and purge away our sins.</hi> 9. It is the glory of the Lord to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get sin, and when remission of sinnes is prayed for according to Gods promise, the Lords glory is engaged for the helping of faith to obtain; <hi>Purge away our sin for thy Names sake.</hi> 10. Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters are ready to insult over Gods people and their religion, and over God also, when the Church is afflicted, and this disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of God true Saints cannot endure; <hi>Wherefore should the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then say, Where is their God?</hi> 11. Howsoever the Lord will pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish his own people for their sins in the sight of the heathen, yet will he not suffer the heathen long to insult over his people, or over the true religion; but by shewing kindnesse to his people, will have the heathen to know that he is their God, who will an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer for himself, and for his people, and their religion also; <hi>Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

should the heathen say, Where is their God?</hi> 12. As it doth belong <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

As the Lords work for his distressed people calleth for thanks at their hands, so also doth it call for praise at their hands, who shall hear of it; and they whose duty it is to give thanks, ought also according to their power, to stirre up others to praise God with themselves, and to stirre up also the posterity in all succeeding ages, as the Church here promiseth: <hi>We will shew forth thy praise to all generations.</hi>

               <p>THis Psalm given to the Church to be made use of, is of the like sad subject with the former, and may be applied to the time of carrying away the ten tribes out of the holy land, while <hi>Iudah</hi> was yet in possession of it, and the Temple was yet standing, and the Lord was dwelling between the Cherubims in the Sanctuary, where the Ark and Mercy-seat was yet remaining; or to the time of the begun desolation of the land by <hi>Nebuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezzar,</hi> or to any other desolation which did threaten their final rooting out. The summe of the Psalm is a lamenting of the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable condition of the <hi>Israelites,</hi> and an earnest entreating of the Lord to give them repentance and a delivery. In the first place, the Church maketh her addresse to God, and propoundeth the main Petition, <hi>ver,</hi> 1, 2, 3.

Conversion of people from their sin unto God, and leading of them back from the misery drawne on by sin, is the work of God, which no man can work of himselfe, or in himself, or in others, till God begin and enable them to return, and lead them on in their turning; Therefore saith the <hi>Psalmist, Turn us again, O Lord:</hi> thus they say as unable to turn again of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. 3.

The people of God may in their afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on put up prayers to God, which he will not accept, to wit, prayers for removing of judgement, when they have not repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the sins which drew on the judgement; yea they may pray long, and be instant in such prayers, and not receive a comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:66460:123"/>
answer; yea they may finde their prayers answered with evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencing of Gods displeasing such prayers; <hi>How long wilt thou be angry against the prayers of thy people?</hi> 2. When God doth not answer the prayers of his people in their affliction, the affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed must not cease to pray on still, neither may the truly godly among them cease to deal with God for his afflicted people, joyned in external Covenant with them, but must continue and be still instant with God, as here they do; <hi>For how long wilt thou be angry against the prayers of thy people?</hi> is a part of their prayer, notwithstanding that God seemeth angry at their prayers. 3. As Gods supremacy over all the hosts of the creatures maketh his wrath more terrible to the supplicant, so should it make the supplicant more instant in prayer, and more loath to take a refusal to his supplication, as here it doth; <hi>O Lord God of hosts, how long wilt thou be angry against the prayers of thy people?</hi> 4. We are not alwayes to look after a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent answer to our prayers, but must wait on so long as God pleaseth not to answer: yea it is possible, that after a believer hath begun to humble himselfe, God may send messenger after messenger of more and more appearance of wrath; but we must resolve, as to wrestle with all difficulties, so also with the sense of Gods anger against us, yea, and that against our prayers: <hi>How long wilt thou be angry against the prayers of thy people?</hi>

Adversity bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to minde neglected prosperity in time past, and the distresse of a Church deprived of former favours putteth a price upon, and giveth lustre unto abused mercies looked back upon: as here, the calamity of the ten tribes, or of the whole twelve tribes cast out of their land, doth make their delivery out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> their planting in <hi>Canaan,</hi> and the mercies which they felt in that land to appear very glorious; and setteth up that their sometime condition in the similtude of a fruitful <hi>vineyard.</hi> 2. There is no fitter similitude then of a vine-tree and of a vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard, to represent the weaknesse of Gods Church and people, and Gods care of them, to have fruits of faith and obedience from them: therefore here and elsewhere is this comparison made use of. 3. It serveth much to help the faith of Gods people in their calamity, to call to minde Gods begun work among them, and in them, and for them: for when his people do claim to wont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed kindnesse, the Lord is ready to make his mercy run in the former channel. This is the ground of the: Churches reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing here, in her supplication to God. 4. It is not enough light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to mention a course of kindnesse shewen to us of God, but every part and passage of it is worthy to be marked and prized highly; as here, 1. <hi>Israels</hi> bringing out of <hi>Egypt</hi> is observed, and compared to the bringing of a noble plant out of a farre countrey in the Lords own hand; <hi>Thou hast brought a vine out of Egypt.</hi> 2.

It is a wonderful and astonishing judgement, to see the Lord cast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down the work of Reformation once begun by him, and plucking up the plantation of his Church once made by him; and yet the provocation of a wicked generation may procure this evil, which hardly can be beleeved till it come; and even then it is wonderful, and should send men unto God, to make them see rightly the causes thereof, as this interrogation importeth; <hi>Why best thou broken down her hedges?</hi> 4.

The Lords people have the fulfilling, supplying and support<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of their emptinesse, wants and weaknesse in God, whose suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency they ought to make use of, and rejoyce therein; <hi>Sing unto God our strength.</hi> 3.

We ought to acknowledge the stately magnificence of our ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted Lord, and our dulnesse and slownesse to praise him: and
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:66460:129"/>
what need we had to be stirred up, and to stirre up one another to this duty: for this was pointed at in the use of the trumpets; <hi>Blow up the trumpet.</hi> 3. We ought to acknowledge that we are subject to various changes, and alteration of conditions in this life, and that all these changes are sanctified unto the Lords people, and that new consolations may be expected from God, one after another, to season the darknesse and nights of our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction: and we should consecrate our selves anew from time to time to God, and give him the first part and flower of our time; yea, should study, that all our time, in all changes what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever may be spent in his service: for thus much did the so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnities in their new Moones hold forth; <hi>Blow up the Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet in the new Moon.</hi> 4.

<pb n="249" facs="tcp:66460:129"/>
therefore it is said here, <hi>For this was a statute for Israel, and a law of the God of Iacob.</hi> As none may appoint acts of religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous worship, but God: so also none may alter nor abrogate them, except God himself only: <hi>For they are statutes and lawes of the God of Iacob.</hi> 2.

ver. 6. <hi>Learn,</hi> 1.

God only is the Redeemer of men from what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever evil condition; no instruments which God doth use, must intercept his glory: none can ease our burden nor cleanse our hands, but God only: <hi>I</hi> (saith the Lord) <hi>removed his shoulder from the burden, and hands from the pots.</hi>

                  <p>From the Lords wise care of them, when they were come out of <hi>Egypt, ver. 7. Learn,</hi> 1.

God who delivereth us from the state of misery, must also deliver us from particular miserable cases, or miserable conditions; yea, and being called upon by us in our misery, he will deliver us as he did <hi>Israel; Thou calledst in trouble, and I delivered thee.</hi> 3. It is Gods wise disposing, that n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

The more the Lord doth manifest him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self from heaven for us, and against our enemies, the greater is our obligation, as <hi>Israels</hi> obligation was augmented, when at their prayer in the red set, the Lord by thunder out of the black cloud against the Egyptians following them, did declare him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self for <hi>Israel: I answered thee in the secret place of thunder.</hi> 5. It is an evidence of the Lords care of his people to put them to the trial of their faith and sincerity of affection to God, that so they may either finde their former profession and opinion of themselves solid and upright, or finding it other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes may be humbled and repent, and become more sincere; therefore is the trial of <hi>Israel</hi> after their coming out of the red sea numbered among the evidences of Gods care of them; <hi>I proved thee at the waters of Moribah.</hi> 6 Calling to minde our misbelief made manifest unto us in the day of our trial, should make us more humble and way to depart from God thereafter; for this is the lesson, which <hi>Israels</hi> striving with God at the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters

the first command: for as God is feared, delighted in, submitted unto, and made our God in effect: so are all the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments kept: <hi>There shall be no strange God in thee.</hi> 2. As sound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse in Religion, and cleaving close to our only one God, (as he hath revealed himself to be the Father, Sonne, and Holy Ghost, of whom, and through whom, and for whom are all things is the fountain of all obedience, and keeping commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with God: so the corrupting of Religion, and departing from this ground in any sort, is the fountain of all following misbehaviour, and discommunion with God; <hi>There shall no strange god be in thee, neither shalt thou worship any strange god.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>From the reasons of this duty set down, <hi>ver. 10. Learn,</hi> 1. The consideration of having our life, and motion, and being of God, and that he will give to all his promises and threatenings certain performance, should move us to beleeve in him, adhere unto him, and serve him only; <hi>I am the Lord, I am Iehovah.</hi> 2. The Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of grace, wherein the Lord hath drawn us, who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse our selves to be his in Christ, should move us to depend on him for righteousness and life, and to study in his strength to please him; <hi>I am the Lord thy God.</hi> 3. The great work of our Redemption, and all the benefits bestowed upon us, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to our bringing out of the slavery of idolatry and Egy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptian darknesse, to the beholding of the marvellous light, and Kingdom of his dear Sonne, represented by the delivery of his people out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> should move us to adhere to our Redeemer, and to aime at his service singly; <hi>I am thy God, who brought thee out of the land of Egypt.</hi> 4.

We answer, <hi>O that my people had hearkened unto me, &amp;c.</hi> sheweth these six things; First, what order the Lord hath set in giving blessings to his visible Church; namely, that they begin and beleeve in him, and study to obey him, and that they by means appointed by him, should look to have such blessings, as he hath promised to beleevers, and to obedient people. Next, this manner of speech sheweth, how acceptable and pleasant un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God it is to see the saith, obedience and welfare of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, all joyned together in his appointed order. Thirdly, that the meritorious and culpable cause of mens miserie, is not in God, but in man, who by his sin deserveth it, and draweth it on himself. Fourthly, that God delighteth not in the death or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of his people, but that they should repent and live. Fifthly, that this is his will, that whosoever shall hear of the evil meeting, which the Israelites did give unto God, and of the judgement which they did draw upon themselves, may be made wise by this lamentation made by God for <hi>Israels</hi> destruction, and so may rather chuse to hearken to God, as they did not, then
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:66460:132"/>
to be given over in his wrath to their own lusts, and to perish in his indignation as befell them, Sixthly, that God requireth a suitable meeting of his people to his dispensations, that is, that they may be so willing to hearken to his voice, and so loath to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend him, as he doth manifest by word and works his willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse to save them, and his loathnesse to destroy them.</p>
                  <p>From the Lords lamenting, <hi>Learn further,</hi> 1. As on the one hand the miscarriage and misery of others before us, should make us wise to eschew the evil which befell them, &amp; to obtain the good whereof they by their disobedience were deprived: So on the other hand, the willingnesse of God to blesse those who do follow his direction, should make us diligent to understand what course God hath prescribed, and should make us confident to obtain bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sednesse in our endevour to follow it; for, <hi>O that my people had hearkened unto me, &amp;c.</hi> doth teach us so much. 2. They may be in the number and estimation of Gods people, by vertue of Church-Covenant, who for their refusing to follow Gods coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell may come short of Gods blessings; for, <hi>O that my people had hearkened unto me, &amp;c.</hi> maketh this evident 3. He who heareth God uttering his wishes for the conversion of his people, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting that his Word is not believed, and that his offer of grace is not received, doth give God an evill meeting, and nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther believeth Gods goodnesse, nor careth for his own salvation, except he joyn with God, lamenting his own misbelief in time past, and do wish heartily the same wish with God for his own conversion for time to come; for this speech, <hi>O that my people had hearkened unto me, &amp;c.</hi> is framed to this very end, to make the hearer willing, and so to convert him, or else to convict him, if he take not hold of the offer. 4. Whatsoever be the Lords se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret decrees concerning the salvation of some, and condemnation of other some in the visible Church; yet the meanes of executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of those decrees, are so holy and just, and wisely carried on, as those decrees shall not be particularly revealed to the stum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling of any man, but the offer of grace and declaration of Gods goodnesse is so laid out in common, that whosoever doth not embrace the same, is made inexcusable; for when God saith, <hi>O that my people had harkened unto me,</hi> he that doth not answer the Lord, with <hi>O that thou wouldst frame this heart of mine, to the obedience of faith,</hi> hath nothing to say if he be damned, for his slighting of the offer so freely held forth unto him, and pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed upon him.</p>

                  <p>In the latter part of the Psalm, is the Churches prayer to God, that he would be party against her enemies, and plague them.

The first is, that God would destroy them, as he destroyed others before them, who were upon such a wicked plot of roo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

When the Church hath to do with her ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, she should look what in Scripture the Lord did for her in times past; for so doth the Church look here to what the Lord did to his enemies, <hi>Iudg.</hi> 7. 22. and 4. 15, 24. and 7. 25. and 8. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

It is lawful to pray for judgements upon the enemies of the Church, provided it be out of a publick spirit, and not out of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate malice or revenge; in which case the prayers of the Church are more forcible for the overthrow of their enemies, then all her external force is: <hi>Do unto them, as unto the Midianites,</hi> is a hard charge against them. 3. Former plagues poured out upon the Churches enemies, are pledges of the Lords bringing like judgements on her enemies afterward, and of giving like preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation unto the Church, as before; <hi>Do unto them as to the Midi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anites</hi> in <hi>Gideons</hi> time, <hi>and to Sisera and Iabin</hi> in <hi>Deborah</hi> time, when small meanes were sufficient for a great overthrow of the enemy. 4. The dead bodies of Gods enemies shall not only be contemptible before men, which is incident to the bodies of the Saints sometimes, but also contemptible before God, as here we see; <hi>Their enemies perished at Endor, and became as dung for the earth.</hi> 5. The Nobles, leaders, &amp; chief amongst Gods enemies, may look for most eminent judgement: <hi>Make their Nobles, like Orch and Zeeb, yea all their Princes like Zebah and Zalmunna.</hi> 6.

                     </gap>ll debarre poor supplicants from accesse unto God, when they come to seek mercy. 4. As new necessities do call to minde old supplies received from God; so they who would have any new benefit from the Lord, should thankfully remember the old, and take encouragement from those to hope for further; <hi>Lord, thou hast been favourable to thy land; thou hast brought back the captivity of Iacob.</hi> 5. As grace is the only ground of Gods bounty to his people, so is it the only ground of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples prayer for new experiences of his grace; as here, Gods favour is acknowledged to be the cause of bringing back the people from captivity, and the ground whereupon the Psalmist foundeth his prayer; <hi>Thou hast been favourable to thy land.</hi> 6. As that is a benefit indeed which is given with remission of sins; so every one who seeketh a benefit, should desire to have the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit which they come to seek, joyned with remission of their sin: as the Psalmist here maketh the bringing back from captivity a compleat favour, because joyned with remission of sinnes: with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which it had been the lesse comfortable; <hi>Thou hast forgiven the iniquity of thy people.</hi> 7. The way of Gods forgiving of sins is, by not imputing of them, not bringing of them forth to be reckoned, but hiding them from justices view, and covering them with the imputation of the righteousnesse of the Redeemer; <hi>Thou hast covered all their sinne.</hi> 8. As while sin unrepented and unforgiven remaineth, wrath also remaineth; so when sinne it taken away, Gods wrath also is taken away, when God forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth sin, he takes away the punishment of sin; for after he hath said, <hi>Thou hast covered all their sin:</hi> he subjoyneth, <hi>Thou hast taken away all thy wrath; thou hast turned from the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

As the conscience of sin, and feeling of wrath lying on, and fearing the growth of it, do much hinder the guilty from confident approach unto God: so the seen experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of Gods drawing of those barres in form<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

The Lords Covenant with his people for everlasting salvation, is a ground to pray and hope for temporal deliverance from God, who hath power and wayes of his own, how to save, when we see no event, <hi>Turn us,</hi> (saith he) <hi>O God of our salvation.</hi> 3. When God gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth grace to a people, to repent and turn to him, the tokens of his wrath will be removed also: or be so changed, as they shall be no more effects of wrath; therefore joyneth he with, <hi>Turn <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

As it is a death to be deprived so much as of the evidence and sense of Gods favour, so it is life to be clear that we are in favour with God: and as such who have had the sense of Gods

                  <p>The first comfort of the afflicted Jewes, troubled for the hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering of the building of Gods Temple is, that God had by his decree and promise made the mountains of <hi>Sion</hi> and <hi>Moriah</hi> the place of his rest amongst his people, till the Messiah should come, in whom these types were to be accomplished, and for whose cause they were to be preserved till he came, who is the only solid rock whereupon the Church is builded. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. When the builders of the Lords Church are few and weak, his people had need to be comforted against their feares and doubts, as here we see: and the way to be comforted in such hard times, is to look by faith to God, as the builder of his own house, who hath laid the foundation upon solid grounds, that every believer that trusteth in him, may be as Mount <hi>Sion,</hi> which cannot be removed; <hi>His foundation is on the holy mount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aines.</hi>

And lastly, finding no comfort, he reneweth his lamentation, leaveth his prayer before the Lord, and writeth it for the edification of the Church in all time coming, as the matter of a joyful Song.</p>

From the Inscription; <hi>Learn, 1. David</hi> was not the only man acquainted with sad exercise and affliction of spirit, for here is another, to wit, <hi>Heman the Ezrahite,</hi> as deep in trouble of spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, as he or any other beside. 2.

When it pleaseth God to exercise a man of parts, of great gifts and graces, he can make his burden proportionable to his strength, and give him as much to do with the difficulties he puts him to, as a weaker man shall finde in his exercise, as appeareth in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of <hi>Heman.</hi> 4 Wise men in their trouble must take the same course with the simpler sort of men, that is, they must run to God as others do, and seek relief only in his grace, who as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

What trouble of a wounded spirit some of Gods children have felt in former times, others dear to God may finde the like in after ages, and all men ought to prepare for the like, and should not think the exercise strange when it cometh, but must comfort themselves in this, that other Saints, whose names are recorded in Scripture, have been under like affliction; for the Psalm is appointed to give instruction; it is <hi>Maschil of He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.</hi> 6. What is at one time matter of mourning to one of Gods children, may become matter of joy and singing afterward, both to himself and to others, as this sad anguish of spirit in <hi>Heman</hi> is made a song of joy, unto Gods glory and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of all afflicted souls, labouring under the sense of sin and felt wrath of God to the worlds end; It is <hi>a Song, a Psalm for the sons of Korah.</hi> 7. Such as are most heavily afflicted in spirit, and do flee to God for reconciliation and consolation through Christ, have no reason to suspect themselves, that they are not esteemed of and loved as dear children, because they feele so much of Gods wrath: For here is a Saint who hath drunken of that Cup, (as deep as any, who shall read this Psalm here is one so much loved and honoured of God, as to be a Pen-man of holy Scripture, and a patern of faith and patience unto o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; even <hi>Heman the Ezrahite.</hi>

When'a soul hath received the offer of grace made to the Church, in the common tender of the Covenant of grace, he is entered into Covenant with God so particularly, as if the Indenture were past between God and that soul by name, so that the beleever may reade his own name in Gods everlasting stiles and titles, and may reade in himself the mark of Gods in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest unto him, and the mark of his interest in God for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more; for, <hi>O God of my salvation,</hi> importeth no lesse. 3.

The ninth degree of his trouble is, that beside all the burden of the foresaid vexation, the Lord deprived him of all comfort, and did not bestow upon him so much as any consolation from his friends, or from the fellowship of the godly wise; but by Gods providence they did leave him as a man desperate, yea as a man whose condition they were afraid to look upon; yea they abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his case and forsook him: and he being thus in appearance shut out from heaven, and followed with wrath from God, was not onely left comfortlesse among men, but also was looked upon by his friends as a damned and abominable reprobate; dealt with as a man shut up for the plague of pestilence, so that he kept his chamber and could not come abroad to look any man in the face: and this also may be the case of a soul precious in Gods eyes, beloved and accepted of him in the very mean time of all this hard exercise: <hi>Thou hast put aw<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </q>
                  <p>In the last part of the Psalm, the Prophet finding no consela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, returneth to his lamentation, by which he made way to his wrestling in prayer, from <hi>ver.</hi> 3. to the 9. and layeth down his misery at the Lords feet, as the object of the bowels of his pity: in which misery he is perswaded, that he could not but finde the effects of the Lords compassion in due time. The parts of the lamentation are three. The first is, for the long continuance of his sad exercise, even from his youth up, wherein he sheweth first, that he <hi>was afflicted,</hi> that is, put to great strait<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Thirdly, that he was as much vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with what he feared to come, as he was troubled with what he felt; <hi>He suffered the terrors of the Lord.</hi> Fourthly, that he was exercised frequently, and of a long time this way; <hi>From his youth <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

When we have assayed all meanes for having comfort of God, it is safest for us to lay our griefe before God, till he be pleased to shew pity: The childe of God hath no oratory but mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his Father, as here we see. 2.

As all the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises of God are worthy to be taken notice of; so in speciall these promises that are made to Christ in favour of Believers, who are the subjects of his Kingdome, in whom all the promises are made <hi>Yea</hi> and <hi>Amen,</hi> to the benefit of the subjects: for this are we taught to do by the example of the <hi>Psalmist,</hi> who when desolation was like to swallow up both Church and Kingdome, doth make fast to his own faith the promise of Ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </q>
                  <p>He laboureth to strengthen his faith in this promise by ten reasons further. The first whereof is this, The heavens are an evidence both of Gods power to work wonders for his people, and of his faithfulnesse to perform promises unto the Church; therefore will he say, I have reason for me to believe this promise made to <hi>David</hi> concerning Christ<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Kingdom. <hi>Whence learne,</hi> 1. The consideration of the power of God manifested in the
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:66460:160"/>
works of creation, to be able to perform whatsoever he promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth, were it never so wonderful, may and should confirm our faith in his promise, how improbable soever it appeare: <hi>For the heavens shall praise thy wonders, O Lord.</hi> 2. As the heavens are a pawne of Gods power, in respect of their first framing them out of nothing: so are they a patern of Gods faithfulnesse, in their constant and orderly motion according to his Word since their framing; <hi>The heavens shall praise thy faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse also.</hi> 3. However the power and faithfulnesse of God may be seen and heard in the work and speech of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens by all men, yet are they not observed and hearkened unto, except in the Church by Gods children; Therefore saith he, <hi>They shall praise thy faithfulnesse also in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation of the Saints.</hi>

                  </q>
                  <p>The second reason to confirme his faith is this, God is above all Angels in heaven and men on earth, and hath them all under him to perfect by them what work he pleaseth; and presuppose they had a minde to hindet any pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose of God concerning performance of his promise, they could not hinder him, they being infinitely inferiour in all excellencies unto God, and no way to be compared with him: Therefore will he say, I have reason to believe his promise concerning the stability of Christs Kingdome. <hi>Whence learne,</hi> 1. The height of Gods excellency is above the reach of our thoughts, and we cannot take him up otherwayes then by climbing up upon the shoulders and tops of all created eminency, and there to proclaime God to be greater then them all: for <hi>Who in heaven can be compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red unto the Lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

God hath given power natural, most of all to Angels; and power accessory, most of all to Princes and Magistrates and Potentates in the earth, whom here he calleth <hi>the sonnes of the mighty;</hi> in whose power and authority we may see somewhat of God, if they bee for God; and may see Princes to bee nothing,

if they be against God; for, <hi>Who in heaven can be compared unto the Lord? who among the sonnes of the mighty can be likened unto the Lord?</hi>

                  </q>
                  <p>A third reason to confirme his faith, is this; God is terrible, and to be stood in awe of by all his people, and it were a fearfull injury for his Saints not to give him the glory of his power and sidelity; Therefore will he say, I have reason to believe what he hath promised con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Kingdome of Christ. <hi>Whence learne,</hi> 1. Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Angels and sanctified men, of all creatures have nearest accesse unto God, and are most like to the dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticks and Courtiers of a King, who attend him daily, and wait upon him; for they are here said to bee <hi>about him.</hi> 2.

The terriblenesse of Gods holy Majesty, and the reverence due to him from all his Saints, should make us afraid to misbelieve his Word and Promises; for this is made a reason of the <hi>Psal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mists</hi> believing the Lords Word: <hi>God is greatly to be fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Assembly of the Saints, and to be had in reverence by all them that are about him.</hi>

The sixth reason, is this; GOD hath done as much already for delivering his Church, by destroying <hi>Rahab,</hi> or the Egypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and scattering of his enemies from time to time, as may assure me both what he can, and what he will do for his people, therefore I may be quiet. <hi>Whence learne,</hi> 1.

                     </gap>oy a Nation of enemies, were they never so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny or powerful, as to wound or kill one man: <hi>Thou hast broken Rahab in pieces, as one that is slain; thou hast scattered thine ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies with thy strong hand.</hi>

                  </q>
                  <p>The seventh reason for confirmation of his faith, is: Heaven and earth, and all creatures in all corners of the world, are the LORDS work sustained by him, and cared for by him, and there is not a mountaine or hill greater or lesser, such as <hi>Tabor</hi> or <hi>Hermon,</hi> which do bear grasse, or corne, or herbs, or trees, or whatsoever may make them look as it were chearfully and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce, but it is by the power of GODS Name: Therefore I may be sure, GOD will much more care for his Church, and for the stability of the Kingdome of Christ. <hi>Whence learn</hi> 1. The heaven and earth, and fulnesse thereof, belongeth to the LORD by due right, and are cared for by him as his own pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session: <hi>The heavens are thine, the earth also is thine: as for the world and fulnesse thereof, thou h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

The ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king and governing of the world, which was made and is govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the use of man, may give assurance that his Church and people, (for whose cause especially all was made,) shall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued from age to age, to long as heaven and<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> earth do remaine; and shall be more particularly cared for, then any other part or

piece of his workmanship: for to this end doth the Psalmist make mention of other creatures appointed to serve man. 3. Seeing the Lord maketh the hills and mountaines, after Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-blasts of frost and snow, to change their countenance, and as it were look joyfully and rejoyce; we may be perswaded that his Church after troubles shall much more change its counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,, and reioyce in Gods Name: For to this end is it said, that these mountaines <hi>Tabor and Hermon shall rejoyce in thy Name.</hi>

Whatsoever are the afflictions of the LORDS people, and in what danger and difficulty soever they be in, yet are they certainly blessed: <hi>Blessed is the people that know the joyful sound.</hi> 2. Those are to be accounted GODS people, who with a good heart joyne with others at GODS command in the worship and service of GOD; <hi>Blessed is the people that know the joyful sound:</hi> for the joyful sound was the sound of the silver trumpets, which were blowne at the joyning in battel in their warres, or for their jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys, or gathering of Assemblies, or intimation of solemne feasts, and at the offering of the sacrifices of Israel, <hi>Psal.</hi> 81. <hi>Numb.</hi> 10. <hi>Ioel</hi> 2. And the knowing of this joyful sound sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth the alacritie of Gods people to serve and obey the Lord, as he in his Ordinances should warne, direct and guide them. 3. The properties and priviledges of B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>lievers in GOD, make sure proof of their blessednesse; for they live in grace and favour with GOD, whether they do sensibly feell it or not: as their persons, so also their carriage in faith, and upright endeavour to please GOD, are alwayes acceptable to GOD: And this is the first priviledge of GODS people, <hi>They shall walke, O LORD, in the light of thy countenance.</hi> 4. Believers have mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and just cause to rejoyce in GOD for their interest in him, what soever be their present condition; <hi>In thy Name shall they
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:66460:163"/>
rejoyce all the day.</hi> This is another priviledge of Gods people. 5. The joy of Believers is underpropped and enlarged, when they consider that Gods righteousnesse (which is by faith in Christ,) is imputed unto them, and Gods righteousnesse in performing his promises is set on work for their direction, encouragement, reformation and defence; <hi>And in thy righteousnesse shall they be exalted.</hi> This is the third priviledge of Believers. 6. Albeit the godly finde no power in themselves, either to do or suffer, no power either to defend themselves, or oppose their enemies; yet they want not strength, either imployed for them, or furnished (as they need) unto them, by God in a glorious manner, as they will see, if his helping them be rightly looked upon; <hi>For thou, Lord,</hi> (saith he) <hi>art the glory of their strength,</hi> wherein they may glory in their weakest condition. And this is the fourth priviledge of GODS people. 7. The free grace and love of GOD graciously tendered to Believers, is the ground of their strength, comfort, confidence and gloriation, because it is the fountaine of all their felicity, and well-spring of life to them, to look unto this, that they are in favour with GOD; <hi>And in thy favour our horne shall be exalted.</hi> And this is the fifth pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge of the LORDS people. 8. Albeit B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>lievers be destitute of help from men; yet they are neither left without protection, nor without government, because God or Christ who is God, is the Churches King, to protect, guide and governe her; for <hi>The Lord is our defence or shield; and the holy One of Israel is our King:</hi> the O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>iginal also will bear <hi>of and to, The Lord is our defence of and to, the holy One of Israel is our King;</hi> whereby what may be said of the typical King, <hi>David,</hi> and of the true King, <hi>Christ,</hi> considered as man, may give assurance that God would be their defence and King, because <hi>David,</hi> ann <hi>Christ</hi> as man, were Gods Kings, and Kings for Gods service and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, authorized of God, and devoted to him. And this is the sixth priviledge of GODS people. All which priviledges are so many proofes of the blessednesse of the Believers, in whatsoever condition they are. 9. It is wisdome for every Believer, when he is about to reckon the riches of GODS people; and to set forth their priviledges, to make application thereof to himself in amongst the rest of that number, as the example of the Psalmist here doth teach us, who in the later part of this computa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

what appeareth outwardly to sense, and then lay out the doubts, feares and tentations before God, to be answered by him, as here the Prophet doth. 4. All those calamities might come upon <hi>Davids</hi> civil Kingdhm, and yet this Covenant made with him as the type of Christ not be dissolved, as experience hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, because the Covenant was not made to exempt him, or his family, or Kingdome from the rods of men, in case by their miscarriage and transgressions they should provoke the Lord; for the last article in the Covenant, in <hi>ver.</hi> 30, 31, 32. expresly holdeth out the contrary. Secondly, because the Covenant in the main scope belonged to Christ and his spiritual Kingdom; to <hi>David</hi> and his children and Kingdom, as to a type and shadow of Christ and his Kingdom, or as they were members of Christs Kingdome for their spiritual good. 5. Sense and carnal reason may misrepresent the Lords dispensation, as if it were contrary to his Covenant and Promise, and contrary to what the godly do beleeve according to Gods Word; as here we see, comparing this lamentation with the former part of the Psalme. 6. If the godly do hold fast to the Word of God, and beleeve what the Lord hath promised, whatsoever appear in the contrary, then may they with great freedom, (yea, and they should of duty and wisdom) lay forth all their tentations, and what carnal rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son and sense speaketh to them before the Lord, who is able to solve all doubts, and satisfie faith, without feare of being mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken, as this lamentation compared with what precedeth, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth manifest. 7. Whatsoever calamity shall crosse the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers hope, God still must be esteemed and held the sender out of the calamity, as well as the Author of the Promise, which the dispensation seemeth to crosse: that the glory, both of justice wounding his childe, and of mercy healing him, may be given to the Lord, as the example of the Psalmist doth teach, who in all the complaint fasteneth all the branches of the calamity upon Gods doing.</p>

                  <p>From the second reason, to confirm his hope to be heard, set down, <hi>ver. 47, 48. Learn,</hi> 1. As our life is short, and the short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of it should be a spu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>

<pb n="328" facs="tcp:66460:169"/>
reasoning. 2. Albeit God hath created no man in vaine, but for his own glory one way or other, yet Gods children have little or no estimation of this life, except that they therein may finde God reconciled, and have communion with him in this life; for this passionate expression, <hi>Wherefore hast thou made all men in vaine?</hi> doth import as much; as we count our life in vaine, and nothing worth to us, if thou shalt not be reconciled unto us. 3. Albeit our words in prayer should be well weighed, yet in sad affliction and grief of heart, words sometime may escape a Saint, which cannot be justified, as here this speech giveth us an instance: for this is a limiting of God to crave comfort in this life to the afflicted, at the time when they shall prescribe, or else to make all their formerly received comforts, and life it self to be in vaine given unto them: for presuppose a man should suffer Gods terror from his youth up, as <hi>Heman</hi> did, and be as a distracted man, because of the terrour of God, and should end his life, as <hi>Heman</hi> doth the preceding Psalm without comfort; yet life eternal might make up the troubles of the wrestling of such a mans <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>aith, and soon recompense the losse of comfort in this life: and yet such is the weaknesse even of Champions like <hi>Ethan;</hi> as to vent some passionate expressions in their trouble: <hi>Why hast thou made all men in vain?</hi> 4. Mortality and shortnesse of life is common to all men: but to be stirred up thereby to the more earnest seeking of spiritual comfort, and preparation for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal life, is the propertie of a childe of God only; such as the Psalmist is, who for this very end, that he might have spiritual comfort, draweth an <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> from mortality; <hi>What man is he that liveth, and shall not see death?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>From the third reason set down, <hi>ver.</hi> 49. taken from the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of mercies, and sworn promises made to <hi>David; Learn,</hi> 1. Albeit a man were in never so hard a condition for his own case, or the case of other godly persons, yet that which God hath done and promised to do unto any beleever, may sustain him when he misseth all comfort or appearance of it; <hi>Lord, where are thy former loving kindnesses unto David?</hi> 2. When the beleever doth misse the comfort which he or any other hath got <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> of God, he should go to the same fountain to have some new experience thereof, as the Palmists example doth teach. 3. The beleever taketh Gods part against all doubts, and disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances of the performing of his promises, as we see in the Psalmist, who when he is missing Gods former loving kindnesse, the continuance whereof was promised and sworn;
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:66460:169"/>
he asserteth the truth of the promise, saying, <hi>Which thou swa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest unto David in thy truth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>From the fourth reason of his hope to have a gracious answer to his prayer, taken from the reproaching of the enemies, as it is set down, <hi>ver. 50, 51. Learn,</hi> 1. Beside inward tentations unto misbelief in the day of trouble, the Lords people use to meet with the mockings of the wicked, insolently scorning their faith in God, which as it vexeth the godly, so is it taken notice of by God: <hi>Remember, Lord, the reproach of thy servants.</hi> 2. The mocking of Religion in the day of the Churches calamity, is so much the more a terrible tentation, as the adversaries who do in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult over Religion, are many and powerful to annoy Gods people, and tread down Religion; <hi>Remember the reproach of all the migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty people.</hi> 3. The reproach of Religion and of the godly doth lie near, and should lie near the heart of every lively member of the Church: <hi>Remember the reproach which I do beare in my bosome.</hi> 4. Such as do reproach Religion and the godly in their calamity, are Gods enemies, and against them God is engaged; <hi>Remember the reproaches, wherewith the enemies have reproached, O Lord.</hi> 5. The blasphemies which do strike against Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised salvation in Christ, and the progresse of his Kingdom, are of all tentations most heavie, and are resented of God most deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; <hi>Remember the reproaches, wherewith they have reproached the footsteps of thine anointed;</hi> for as <hi>Davids</hi> posterity and succession went on one generation after another, so Christ made his approaches nearer to his incarnation; and when the family of <hi>David</hi> seemed to grow weak, the godly were assaulted with feares and doubts about the coming of the Messiah: and the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly mocked the matter of Chris<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>From the close of the Psalm, <hi>ver. 52. Learn,</hi> 1. Presuppose a beleever should not finde present comfort in his sad condition, yet it is an ease to have poured out his complaint before the Lord: and this liberty of speech is a gift worthy of thanksgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving; for, <hi>Blessed be the Lord,</hi> doth the Prophet adde, when he hath said all he would say. 2. We should close and leave our prayer before God in good termes, however he shall answer us, or seem to dispose of matters towards us: and we should blesse him, do what he pleaseth as the Psalmist doth here: <hi>Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed be the Lord for evermore.</hi> 3.

saying, <hi>Amen.</hi> Yea the more tentation doth drive us unto mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief, the more should faith look for a deliverance, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here to the truth of Gods Covenant, as here the Prophet doth by doubling his seale, say,</p>

               <head>PSAL. XC. <hi>A Prayer of Moses the man of God.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THis Psalm agreeth well with the latter end of <hi>Moses</hi>'s life, when he being now to remove, did present this prayer to God, and delivered it unto the Church, for their comfort and direction, how to carry themselves towards God in their short and sorrowful life.</p>
               <p>The Psalme may be divided into three parts. In the first, is the Churches fourfold comfort against temporal troubles and miseries in this world. The first is taken from the Lords kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse to his people in all ages, <hi>ver.</hi> 1. The second is taken from the decree of their election, <hi>ver.</hi> 2. The third from the hope of their resurrection, <hi>ver.</hi> 3. The fourth from the shortnesse of time unto it, <hi>ver</hi> 4. In the second part, the shortnesse and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>series of life procured by sinne, are lamentably set forth before the Lord, who is full of pity, <hi>ver.</hi> 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11. In the last part are six petitions, some whereof are for the right use of the shortnesse and sorrowes of this life, and some of them for a gracious deliverance from them, <hi>ver.</hi> 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17.</p>
               <p>From the Inscription; <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. A teacher of Gods people should earnestly intercede by prayer for Gods people, as <hi>Moses</hi> did; This is <hi>a prayer of Moses.</hi> 2. He that sitteth in <hi>Moses</hi> his chaire should be furnished with gifts for the Ministery, called of God, consecrated unto God in his heart for this purpose, and altogether set for God in his practice, for so <hi>Moses</hi> was, <hi>A man of God.</hi> 3. As the conscience of being, <hi>A man of God,</hi> is a singular comfort and encouragement to a Minister in his life-time: so is it a singular honour to him, living and dead, before God and men, to be in effect, <hi>A man of God,</hi> as here it

                  <p>The first comfort of the Lords people, against the miseries of this life is, from the Lords kindnesse to his people in all ages. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. There is no dealing with God in prayer, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept we lay hold on the offer of Gods kindnesse, according to the Covenant of grace, and do look upon God as gracious to us in Christ; Therefore here and elsewhere, supplicants do begin with renewed acts and expressions of saving faith. 2. Gods people in every place and age, is one incorporation with Gods people in all ages preceding and following and may lay claim to all the priviledges of Gods people before them, as here the Church in <hi>Moses</hi> time joyneth it selfe with all the Lords people in former times, for the use of suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding ages which were to come; <hi>Lord, thou hast beene our dwelling place in all generations.</hi> 3. Albeit the Lords people be strangers in the earth; partly, because they have no certain residence in this world; partly, because they are evil entertained by men of this world, but specially, because in their affections they are pilgrims in this world; yet they want not a resting place, and a dwelling in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, even God himself, in whom they dwell by faith, and finde in him rest, and food, and protection, and comfort; yea, and in his heart they have had a lodging in all ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations; <hi>Lord, thou hast been our dwelling place in all generations.</hi> 4. Troubles and miseries of this life do make the godly to search out their interest in God, and in another life, as here and elsewhere we may perceive in the exercise of Gods children: their straits on earth, do make them seek inlargement in heaven.</p>

The second comfort of the Believer against the miseries of this short life, is taken from the decree of their Election, and the eternal Covenant of Redemption of them setled in the purpose and counsel of the blessed Trinity for their behoof, wherein it was agreed before the world was, that the <hi>Word</hi> to be incarnate, should be the Saviout of the Elect: for here the asserting of the eternity of God, is with relation to his own chosen people; for, <hi>Thou hast been our dwelling place in all generations, and thou art God from everlasting to everlasting,</hi> is in substance thus much. Thou art from everlasting to everlasting the same unchangeable God in purpose and affection toward us thy people, and so thou art <hi>our God</hi> from everlasting, in regard of thy eternall purpose of love, Electing us; and in regard of thy appointing Redemption for us by the Redeemer. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. From Gods good will to us in time, we may arise to Gods good will to us before time; and from grace shewed to us in time, we may conclude grace and good will purposed toward us, and ordained for us before time: Thus doth the Psalmist teach us to climb; for after he hath said, <hi>From generation to generation, thou hast been our dwelling place,</hi> that is, in all time past thou hast been our God; he subjoyneth, <hi>Before the mountaines were brought forth, cre ever thou hadst formed the earth and the world, thou art God:</hi> That is, the same God unchangeably in thy purpose and love toward us before time from everlasting. 2. From speciall love shewen to us in time, we may conclude love to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward us, not onely before time from everlasting, but also that it shall continue toward us after time for ever; <hi>Even from ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting to everlasting thou art God,</hi> saith he; that is, the same strong God immutable in thy purpose and love toward us first and last: and indeed faith cannot fix it self, till by the warrant of Gods Word, and feeling of his gracious working <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

It will cost the Lord but a word to make the dead to rise againe, or to make them that are destroyed, to returne againe; <hi>Thou sayest, Returne, ye children of men.</hi> His Word is already past forth in the Doctrine of the Resurrection, and is altogether operative, shall prove fully effectual at length.</p>

Albeit our life be both short, and uncertain how soon it may end, yet we look upon the indesinitesse of the time of continuance of it, as if the duration of it were infinite, and our yeares were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable; for, <hi>Teach us to number our dayes,</hi> importeth some acknowledgement of this fault. 2. Albeit it be easie for us to consider how many of our dayes are already past, and how few these that are to come must be by course of nature, or may be few in the way of Gods ordinary providence; yet this lesson, how easie

                  <p>In this last verse are the two last heads of his prayer; The first Petition is, that God would beautify his people with his holy Ordinances, with order, and unity and peace, with a holy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation, and the evidences of his dwelling among them, as his own confederate people, proper subjects of his Kingdome, and domesticks of his own family. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. As God is the glory of his own people, in whom is their beauty and ornament, whereby they are made honourable in the sight of all Nations, as the Bride is made comely by the attire and ornaments put upon her: so should his people esteem of him, affect and love him, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member him, and seek their beauty in him: <hi>Let the beauty of the Lord be upon us.</hi> 2. Then is the beauty of the Lord upon his people, and seen to be on them, when they behave themselves as his covenanted people, walking in faith and obedience before him, and he sheweth himselfe their covenanted God, protect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and blessing them: <hi>Let the beauty of the Lord our God be up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us;</hi> and this Petition was granted all the dayes of <hi>Ioshuah,</hi> and of the Elders that outlived <hi>Ioshuah.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The sixth Petition is, that God would blesse the endeavours of his people for promoting of Gods work among them, and for transmitting his Ordinances and his truth to the posterity. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1.

                  <p>The summe of the Psalme is, an encouragement to believe in God, by nine motives or inducements, most of them being precious Promises, whereunto Christ our Lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>d hath the first right and title; and we onely in and through him. The first motive is, because the believer shall have the warme and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable protection of God Almighty. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. Trust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in God, is the means of entertaining of constant con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction and communion with God; for he that is a belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, <hi>dwelleth in the secret place of the most High.</hi> 2. The unsearcheable depths of the riches of Gods truth, grace, pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and goodnesse, and of his other attributes, whereupon faith doth fixe it selfe, are a mystery to the world, which
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:66460:175"/>
carnal reason knoweth not, nor how to make use thereof; and therefore is well compared to <hi>a secret place: He that dwelleth in the secret place of the most High.</hi> 3. In <hi>the most High</hi> is whatsoever the Believer standeth in need of, a <hi>habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> well furnished with ease, comfort, peace, refreshment, protection, and whatsoever else a soule could wish; for, the <hi>secret place of the most High,</hi> where the believer may and must dwell, is Gods truth and love; and unto him that dwelleth here, is the Promise made. 4. The Believer is not exempted by his faith from trouble (yea, trouble and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise from his enemies he may surely expect) but he is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted from being taken, overcome, and destroyed by them: for a refuge, <hi>even the secret place of the most High;</hi> here is provided for him. 5. He that betaketh himselfe unto God for refuge. and will make his refuge his habitation, shall not be refused lodging, nor be thrust out when he is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered: <hi>He shall abide in the shadow of the Almighty.</hi> 6. The scorching heat of persecution shall not prevaile against the Believer; for Gods omnipotencie shall be imployed for his protection and consolation: <hi>He shall abide in the shadow of the Almighty.</hi>

                  </q>

He that hath experience of the fruit of faith, is the fittest man to bear witnesse of it, and most able to speak from his own perswasion to the perswasion of others; <hi>I will say of the Lord, He is my refuge and my fortresse.</hi> 2.

A kindly beleever should love to have others belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in God, as he himself doth, and should leave nothing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done to perswade others to beleeve, as his calling requireth: for the example of the Psalmist teacheth us so. 2. There are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny tentations, whereby Satan (as a fowler laying snares) catch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth poor foolish sinners, and there is much contagion of sinne, whereby albeit men are infected one by another, and many do perish; yet the beleever in God is either preserved from falling into the snare, and from being corrupted with contagion of others ill speeches and manners, or else he is rid and delivered out of the danger; <hi>Surely he shall deliver thee from the snare of the fowler, and from the noisome pestilence.</hi> 3. As there are dangers in relation to our spiritual condition unavoidable, if God do not deliver us; so are there dangers of plots and conspiracies by wicked enemies in relation to bodily dangers also, from which the wisdom of beleevers could not deliver them: but God hath promised a deliverance, or a good escape from them all, so as the beleever shall be no loser; <hi>Surely he shall deliver thee from the snare of the fowler, &amp;c.</hi>

                  <p>A fourth motive is, a promise of comfortable and sure de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence against the invasion of the enemies, set forth under sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry similitudes usual in Scripture. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. The care and watchfulnesse of God over his own is such, as neither Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture nor Art can yield sufficient similitudes to expresse it, as the borrowing of more similitudes, some from one thing, and some from another, doth here shew. The watchfulnesse of the
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:66460:176"/>
bird over her young ones, and the care that a man hath in bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel to preserve his own body from hurt, are but imperfect sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes to represent the watching care of God for a beleever. 2. As the Lord descendeth unto our capacity in such low similitudes of protection and comfort, so he requireth of us, that by those we should ascend in our faith to rely confidently and lovingly upon him: <hi>He shall cover thee with his feather; and under his wings shalt thou trust.</hi> 3.

                  </q>
                  <p>A fifth motive to beleeve, is from a more particular promise of safety unto the beleever from all sort of deadly enemies and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, wherinto when many do fall the beleever shall stand. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. The true remedy against tormenting fear, is faith in God: for many terrible things may befall men, when they are most secure, like unto those that befall men in the night: but for any harme which may befall the beleever this way, the Lord here willeth him to be nothing afraid: <hi>Thou shalt not be afraid for the terrour by night.</hi> 2. Many sudden accidents may befall men when they are most watching, and upon their guard, but the Lord willeth the beleever to be confident, that he shall not be harmed this way: <hi>Thou shalt not be afraid for the arrow that fleeth by day.</hi> 3. Many evils are men subject unto, which come up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them they cannot tell how, but from such evils the Lord assureth the beleever he shall have no harme; <hi>Thou shalt not be afraid of the pestilence which walketh in darknesse.</hi> 4. Men are subject to many evils which come upon them openly and not unawares, such as are calamities from enemies and oppressors; the Lord willeth the believer to be confident that he shall not
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:66460:177"/>
be harmed this way; <hi>Thou shalt not be afraid for the destruction which walketh at noon-day.</hi> 5. When trials and tentations come upon the world to try the children of men, albeit many fall by those tentations, yet the man who beleeveth in God shall stand: whether the tentation come upon the left hand, with l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Angels wait upon the beleever, and carefully to attend his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in all his lawful affaires, lest he should stumble and suffer harme; which promise even Satan doth acknowledge to belong unto Christ, and Christ doth owne it, being taken in a right sense, <hi>Mat. 4.

                  <p>The ninth motive to beleeve in God, is taken from a bundle of five or six promises, as spoken immediately by God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of his Son Jesus Christ as man, and of every beleever and true member of his mystical body. The first promise is of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livering of the beleever from whatsoever trouble or danger he can be presupposed to fall into: <hi>I will deliver him,</hi> saith the Lord. 2. For trial of true faith, the unquestionable property of a beleever, and the evidence of a sound and saving faith in God, is fixed love toward God; <hi>because he hath set his love upon me.</hi> 3. As there is a <hi>because</hi> and a <hi>therefore</hi> in the processe of the law, in concluding death for sin, so there is a <hi>because</hi> and a <hi>there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore</hi> in the processe of grace, and of the <hi>Gospel,</hi> which doth rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son from one grace given to inferre another grace to be given, even grace for grace: and such is this here: <hi>Because he hath set his love on me, I will deliver him.</hi> 4. Sound love to God floweth from, and is joyned with sound knowledge of God, as his Majesty is declared unto us in Scripture: The beleever who hath set his <hi>love</hi> upon God, <hi>hath known my Name,</hi> saith he. 5. As the beleever is highly priviledged and honoured of God, being made a sonne and an heire, and co-heire with Christ: so shall he be made also more then a Conquerour over all his enemies, through Christ; <hi>I will set him on high, because he hath known my Name;</hi> this is the second promise. 6. The third promise is, the Lord will give the Spirit of supplication to the beleever,
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:66460:179"/>
and also a satisfactory answer unto his prayer; for as when <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> man giveth way to misbelief, he cannot pray any more: so when he entertaineth faith, it maketh him eloquent and instant in prayer, till he receive what he seeketh; <hi>He shall call on me, and I will answer him.</hi> 7. As it is not to be expected, that the man who beleeveth in God shall want trouble, so the beleever may be sure, that God who exerciseth him with trouble, shall bear him company in his trouble, shall direct him how to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have himself in it, strengthen, support and comfort him under it, and give him delivery out of all his trouble, and not only put respect upon him in the sight of them who did behold his exercise, but also at last shall glorifie him before men and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels; and this is the fourth promise: <hi>I will be with him in trouble, I will deliver him and honour him.</hi> 8. While others do either want submission unto God at Gods pleasure to live in trouble, or do want submission to die at Gods pleasure, if they be not in trouble; the beleever only hath satisfaction in the length of his life, to die or live as the Lord liketh, and he only departeth contentedly, and entereth into a life everlasting; <hi>With long life will I satisfie him;</hi> and this is the fifth promise. 9. When the beleever hath received of God satisfaction in the length of life in this world, God will enter him into the possession of bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sednesse, of everlasting salvation in the world to come; which is worthily called <hi>the salvation of God; With long life will I sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie him;</hi> and what then shall become of him? <hi>And I will shew him my salvation;</hi> and this is the sixth promise.

From the Lords goodnesse to all beleevers in general; <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. The promises and comforts given to any one beleever, are not proper to him only, but common to all beleevers; and the man who can apply these promises to himself, is the fittest man to bear witnesse of the interest which others have therein: for what the Psalmist hath applied to himself, he extendeth to all in substance; <hi>The righteo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

The Lords children are like trees which do not grow in every soile, are not nourished with every moisture; the place of their planting, growth and flourishing, is the house of the Lord, where the Word and Spirit of the Lord joyned with the holy ordinances may be had for food: <hi>They are planted in the house of the Lord, and fl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Not every barren tree or weed, not every one who is in the visible Court of Gods Church doth grow and flourish; or is made partaker of the spiritual grace and blessing of the ordinances, but only planted ones, that is, such plants as the heavenly Father hath planted: for to those only, who by Covenant have embraced God, is the promise made; <hi>Those that be planted in the house of the Lord, shall flourish in the Courts of our God.</hi> 5. True beleevers shall still persevere, and the decay of the outward man shall not hinder the renewing of their inward man day by day; and their last works shall be better then their first; <hi>They shall still bring forth fruit in old age; they shall be fat and flourishing.</hi> 6. The end of the Lords destroying of the wicked, and of his blessing of the true beleever with the growth of grace, and perseverance to the end, is the glory of Gods righteousnesse, singlenesse in Covenant-making, and of his constant affection to uprightnesse; for these threatenings and promises shall be made good, <hi>To shew that the Lord is upright.</hi> 7.

The exposition of a mans exercise, and the meaning of the rod must be taken from Gods Word, and God only can effectually teach men to carry themselves in trouble ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lily and righteously in all patience; <hi>Blessed is the man whom thou chastenest, O Lord: and teachest him out of thy law:</hi> 4.

                  <p>From his seeking assistance against oppression; <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. There is a lawful defence of the godly, while they are oppressed by their superiours, which is no wayes injurious to authority, such as is to bear witnesse for the godly, to speak and make request unto the Rulers for them, as <hi>Ionathan</hi> did for <hi>David,</hi> and <hi>Ebedmelch</hi> did for <hi>Ieremy,</hi> to countenance and assist them in their appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances for defence of the truth, as <hi>Pauls</hi> companions should have done, when he was brought before <hi>Nero,</hi> and such as here was sought after by the <hi>Psalmist; Who will rise up for me against the evill doers? who will stand up for me against the workers of iniquity.</hi> 2. When the godly suffer injury by their own Rules, who should maintain them, few or none possibly will be found to countenance them in their righteous cause; for this saying, <hi>Who will arise for me?</hi> doth shew that none did offer themselves: and he knew none, when he thus did misse all help. 3. Before the godly complaine of wrongs done to them by their superiours, they should be first sure that they have done no wrong, or any thing which Rulers may justly punish, and that their Rulers are not onely injurious to them in a particular, but evill doers also, and open enemies to equity; <hi>Who will rise up for me against the evill doers? or who will stand up for me against the workers of iniquity?</hi> 4. Rulers should be warie that they force not the righteous to complain to God and man of them; for if they do, the oppressed may readily fell upon the <hi>Psalmists</hi> outery, and that is not safe for the Magistrate, that any should have cause

When mischief is enacted by Law, then shortly may the godly be pannelled as criminally guilty, and they who allow the Law, shall be found ready to sit upon Assises to condemn the righteous, as the experience of the <hi>Psalmist</hi> doth shew: <hi>They gather themselves together against the soule of the righteous, and condemn the innocent blood.</hi>

               <p>THis Psalme is applied to Christ by the Apostle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3. 7, 8, 9, 10, 11. Whereof there are two parts.

The arguments of pral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing and worshiping of him are five. The first, because he is the rock of our salvation, <hi>ver.</hi> 1, 2. The second, because of his greatnesse, <hi>ver.</hi> 3. The third, for his power, <hi>ver.</hi> 4. The fourth, because he created all things, and us his people, <hi>ver.</hi> 5, 6. The fifth, because he is our covenanted God and Pastor, <hi>ver,</hi> 7.

                  <p>From the first exhortation unto a chearful praising and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipping of God, manifesting himselfe in Christ to his Church,
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:66460:189"/>
and unto joyful thanksgiving for salvation offered, and granted to us in him, which is the first reason to move them to the duty; <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. As the necessity and acceptablenesse of the duty of praising God, and thanksgiving unto him, is very remarkable; so is our unreadinesse unto the duty, and unchearfulnesse in it observable also: for the frequent and pressing exhortations thereunto do intimate so much unto us: <hi>O come, let us sing unto the Lord; let us make a noise, let us come before him.</hi> 2. Every one, but specially the Lords Ministers, should stirre up their people and others also to this duty, to discharge it not only in secret, but also publickly in their Congregations, and that with chearfulnesse, with heart and voice, whatsoever shall be their private grievances and burdens; <hi>Let us come before his presence with thanksgiving, and make a joyful noise unto him with Psalms.</hi> 3. Whatsoever evil or grief do trouble us; there is reason of joy and praise and thanks, when we look to Jesus Christ and his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits: <hi>Make a joyful noise unto the Rock of our salvation.</hi> From him is our full deliverance, and upon him lieth our victory over sin, Satan, death, hell, and all enmity, founded as upon a Rock. 4. It is time to come before God for mercy to prevent justice, while yet we are spared; and he is not come to us in judgement; for so the Word in the original giveth ground, signifying com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing speedily, and with prevention: <hi>Let us speedily come before his presence,</hi> or preoccupy his presence. 5. He that cometh to God in Christ, meeteth with his reconciled face; for the coming to the Tabernacle, the Ark and mercy-seat, did signify and promise so much: and therefore it is said, <hi>Let us come before his presence,</hi> or <hi>before his face.</hi> 6. Singing of Psalmes should be done as a matter of honouring God, and not as a matter of pleasing our own eares, or the eares of others; <hi>Let us come with thanksgiving,</hi> or confession and praising, <hi>and make a joyfull noise unto him with Psalmes:</hi>

The visible Catholick Church, which hath the Word of God preached unto them, and are in Covenant with him, is the people of Christs pasture, and sheep of his hand, wherein may be found many such as harden their heart and perish, and so are not all of them elect persons; for, <hi>To day if ye will hear his voice,</hi> is spoken unto all, to whom the Word of God doth come, and doth bring them in the bond of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant to hear his voice. 3. Of such as are in Covenant with God in Christ, to believe and obey his voice, those only are actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally true disciples, who have this property; to love, to believe, and to obey Gods voice, to yield their heart to the Lords Word: <hi>To day if ye will hear his voice,</hi> is here the probation of their cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanted profession. 4. The present time only is the opportunity of salvation, or embracing of the offer of Gods grace, and testify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our obedience of saith; we are not sure how long the Word shall remain with us, or we with it: <hi>To day if ye will hear his voice.</hi> 5. How ignorant, weak, and unable soever a man be by nature, to believe and obey the voice of God, yet seeing God doth offer himselfe by his Word to cure him of all his evils, he cannot endure that a man should wittingly &amp; willingly reject the
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:66460:191"/>
counsel of the Lord, and resolutely strengthen himself in his natural misbelief and disobedience, for this were to harden his own heart yet more, which here is forbidden: <hi>To day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your heart.</hi> 6. The example of other mens sinnes should be made use of to make us wise for eschew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the like; as here the history of the peoples murmuring against God and his Ministers, is for this end recorded from <hi>Exod.</hi> 17. 3, 4. concerning their <hi>tentation of God, and provocation of him in the willernesse.</hi> 5. It is to good purpose that we look upon the sins of our fore-fathers, and upon Gods judgements on them for their sins, that we may be humbled &amp; m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

The Lord not only marketh mens sins, but also doth reckon how long they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in them: <hi>Fourty yeares long was I grieved.</hi> 10.

The errors of the minde are dangerous; but the errors of the heart are yet more dangerous: for the faults of the minde simply considered, are ignorance and error; but the fault of the heart, is a loving of darknes and error: the error of the minde saith, I knew not, I did not understand such a duty; but the error of the heart saith no lesse then, I will not know; I desire not to hear of, I care not for such a duty; <hi>I said it is a people that do erre in their heart, and they have not known my wayes:</hi> that is, they have not regarded my wayes, have not allowed of them, or loved them; for otherwayes they were not simply ignorant of them; they heard his words, and <hi>saw his works.</hi> 12. Not to subject our selves to such and such particular hard exercises, difficulties, straits, and sad dispensations, as it pleases God to put us under, is a not knowing and disapproving of the ways of God, which he followeth in deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with his people, and is no lesse then if we did take upon us to be wiser then he, and to counsel and direct him how to govern the world and our particulars better then he doth; <hi>They erre in heart, and have not known my wayes.</hi>

Albeit bodily sacrifices and oblations, and the material Temple of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> be taken away: yet the moral duties shadowed forth in them, are still necessary to be done: we must not come for fashion, empty and vaine before God, but with the calves of our lips, offering up our selves in a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving sacrifice, holy and acceptable to him: <hi>Bring an offering un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to hm.</hi> 5.

the world of his Elect and Regenerate people: for by Christs governing <hi>the world also shall be established.</hi> 3. The Kingdom of Christ is a Kingdom which cannot be moved, and they who are his Subjects, do receive this Kingdom in title and right, and begun possession, which cannot be taken from them again; <hi>The world also shall be established that it cannot be moved.</hi> 4. The government of Christs Kingdom is so well and wisely carried by him, as right is done to God and man, to friends and foes, and no injury to any party is allowed; and course is taken to give effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually to every man according as his work shall be: <hi>He shall judge the people righteously.</hi> 5. There is no true rejoycing for sinners in heaven or earth, except in and through Jesus Christ alone: all joy of sinners without him is madnesse, and in him men have cause of rejoycing whatsoever condition they shall be in: <hi>Let the heaven rejoyce, and let the earth be glad; let the sea roare, and the fulnesse thereof</hi> 6. The joy which Christ bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to his people is such, that men and Angels are not able to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse it; and if all the dumb creatures had mindes and mouthes to set it forth, it were a taske and more for them to undertake it: <hi>Let the heavens rejoyce, and the earth be glad; let the sea roare, and the fulnesse thereof, &amp;c.</hi> 7. As all the creatures are in a sort of bondage and subjection unto vanity through the sins of men; so have they their own redemption &amp; freedom from vanity in rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to Christ, and the service which they do unto the Saints, who make right use of them; and at length the creature shall be fully delivered from the bondage of corruption, and in its owne kinde have cause of rejoycing: <hi>Let the heaven, earth, sea and fields re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce, &amp;c.</hi> 8. All the creatures are at enmity with man, before he be reconciled to God in Christ; but when peace is made by Jesus Christ, they look upon man all of them with another coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, as servants unto and children of their Lord, who is Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the reconciled, and governour of all for their good: <hi>Let the fields be joyful, and all that is therein; then shall all the trees of the wood rejoyce.</hi> They shall look upon a reconciled man walking in the light of Gods countenance as a Paradise. 9. The first and second coming of Christ to shew himself King of his Church, is ground and cause of all joy to his Subjects; <hi>Let them and all the creatures rejoyce before the Lord, for he cometh,</hi> for this <hi>for he cometh</hi> (twice said) <hi>to judge the earth,</hi> is given for a reason of the exhortation. 10. By Christs government, every poor and needy Subject is helped, supplied, comforted and provided for, as their case requireth: all the Subjects are justified by the

               <p>THis Psalme is an exhortation to Jew and Gentile, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce and blesse the Lord for Christs coming, to set up his Kingdome in the world. The exhortation is thrice pressed. 1. In proper termes, requiring the Church to sing for joy, with reasons adjoyned, <hi>ver.</hi> 1, 2, 3. Then it is repeated, and musical instruments called for, to shew that by humane voice the matter of the joy which is in Jesus Christ, is inexpressible, <hi>ver.</hi> 4, 5, 6. 3. To shew that neither voice of man, nor musical instruments are sufficient to expresse the joy which cometh by Christs Kingdome: the whole creatures are called unto this work of rejoycing, and setting forth his glory, <hi>ver.</hi> 7, 8. And the reason is given, because Christ cometh to set up, and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise his Kingdome in righteousnesse, <hi>ver. 9.</hi>

                  </q>
                  <p>The exhortation to sing unto the Lord, who is Christ, hath five reasons adjoyned. The first is, because he hath wrought the work of Redemption wonderfully. The next is, because he hath done his work by conflict with his enemies, and hath got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten the victory, <hi>ver.</hi> 1. The third, because he hath caused to preach his salvation to the Gentiles, <hi>ver.</hi> 2. The fourth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he hath performed his promises made to the Jewes. And the fifth, because he hath made all the earth to see the salvation, which God in Covenant with his Church hath wrought for his
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:66460:199"/>
people, <hi>ver. 3. Whence learne,</hi> 1. The joy which Christ doth bring, can never waxe old: but because mercies through him are everlasting, and the persons who have share in this joy, are made new, and all things unto them are made new; therefore the song and joy also shall be made new: <hi>O sing unto the Lord a new song.</hi> 2. Salvation brought by Christ, and the work of Redemption wrought by him, is a most wonderful work; for it is brought about by the incarnation of God, by the painfull suffering and shamefull death of God inearnate; by whose stripes we are healed, and by whose death and resurrection we have life, and immortality given unto us: <hi>For he hath done marvellous things.</hi> 3. It is by battell against the enemies of our salvation that we are delivered: for Christ hath wrestled with the guilti, nesse, merit, and punishment of our sins; wrestled with the curse of the Law, with Satan, death and hell; and whatsoever could hinder our Redemption and Salvation, and hath gotten unto himselfe the victory to our advantage; <hi>His right hand, and his holy arme hath gotten him the victory.</hi> 4. No creatures help hath our Lord used in this work, but done all immediately by his own divine power, being God Omnipotent; <hi>His right hand, and his holy arme hath gotten him the victory.</hi> 5. The glory of the salvation of man, by this meanes is most justly to be ascribed to him alone, and to be called his salvation; because he devised it, and brought it about immediately by himself, and causeth to proclaime it in his own Name to the world by the preaching of the Gospel: so it is in all these respects his salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: <hi>The Lord hath made known his salvation.</hi> 6. The way how Christ maketh known his salvation, and maketh us par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of his salvation, is by making known <hi>his righteousnesse,</hi> or the righteousnesse of faith; and making us partakers there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of by the preaching of it among the Gentiles; <hi>His righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse hath <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Whatsoever in Scripture is said of Christ, will be found to be really in him; he will answer to his name perfectly in all things, without staine or blot: <hi>Let them praise thy great and terrible Name, for it is holy.</hi> 4. Albeit the enemies of Christ, despise the weaknesse and simplicity of his Government, yet he is a powerful and strong King, both in himself, and in and for all who beleeve in
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:66460:201"/>
him; for here the Church praiseth <hi>the Kings strength.</hi> 5. Christ moderateth his power, specially in relation to his subjects, and doth not what he may: dealeth not in the rigour of justice with his people, layeth no more on them then they are able to beare: his yoke is easie and his burden is light; yea, he suffereth them not to be tempted above their strength, but dealeth discreetly with them; moderation and discretion pleaseth him: <hi>The Kings strength loveth judgement.</hi> 6. The course which our God hath set down for comforting the afflicted, relieving the oppressed, taking order with hypocrites and obstinate offenders, is very equitable, and a course which he will not alter or change; for, <hi>He loveth judgement, and thou dost establish equity,</hi> saith he. 7. Christs actions and dispensations are answerable to his Lawes and his revealed Word; he teacheth his subjects righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse; he maketh them righteous, performeth his promises, and executes his threatenings in his Church, according to his sacred Word: <hi>Thou executest judgement and righteousnesse in Iacob.</hi>

                  <p>The next reason is from the example of holy men of God, <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> Priests or chief Officers, and <hi>Samuel</hi> a Priest, Prophet, and Ruler of the Lords people, who all of them subjected themselves to the Ordinances of God; and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped him to their own great utility, and advantage also of them, with and for whom they prayed unto God, and worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped him. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. The examples of holy men of God commended in Scripture unto us, do serve for inducement and encouragement unto us, to beleeve in God, to worship, and to obey him: <hi>Moses and Aaron among his Priests,</hi> or chief Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, <hi>and Samuel among them that call upon his Name.</hi> 2. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the holiest men of God that ever were in the Church, stood in need of the ordinary meanes of grace and worship, and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected themselves unto Ordinances, the Lord will have none of his people to neglect Ordinances, or lift themselves above Ordinances; for, <hi>Moses, Aaron and Samuel were among them
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:66460:202"/>
that call upon his Name.</hi> 3. Whoever worship God, and obey his Ordinances uprightly, are enrolled in the catalogue with the chiefest Saints, worshippers of God; <hi>Moses, Aaron and Samuel among them that call upon his Name.</hi> 4. The prayers of the faithfull are not frustrated, but have a good answer; and the answer of the holiest supplicants is set forth to encourage the meanest of believers to call upon God also, as the impartial hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the prayers of all that call upon God in truth; for he is no accepter of persons: and to shew this, it is said here, <hi>They called upon the Lord, and he heard them.</hi> 7. The more evidences we have of Gods presence, and the more familiarly he conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scendeth to teach us, the more humble and observant should we be of his Ordinances and Commands; <hi>He spake unto them in the cloudie pillar: they kept his testimonies, and the Ordinances which he gave them.</hi>

                  <p>From the reasons of this exhortation; <hi>Learne,</hi> 1.
