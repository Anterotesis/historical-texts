            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </gap>onts have lately beene offerd by the Rebellions Scots, who under pretence of Religion would ouerthrow the Hierarchy of the Church, pulling downe the house of God, and building Babels of their owne invention, and man'd with this furious zeale, they have raised great forces, and stand ready armed in the Field to resist the head of the Church in his Dominions our most gracious King CHARLES; <hi>Time</hi> therefore hearing how these bold Attempts un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Title of Covenanters bad acted many outrages, entrencht vpon the Kings So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraigne power, and have hitherto neglected and slighted his Royall authority; therefore in this complaint of <hi>Time</hi> some reasons are laid downe. For the Chronicles of this Land due witnesse that Rebels have beene alwayes overthrowne in their designes, and at last met with a deserved Death. Thus <hi>Mortimer</hi> who rebelled against King <hi>Edward</hi> the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, and violently tooke away his Queene, was afterwards himselfe taken and behea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. Also those rude mechannicke Rebels that were led under the conduct of <hi>Watt Tiler, Tom Miller,</hi> and <hi>Iack Strae</hi> made a great tumultuous vproare in <hi>Kent</hi> and <hi>Essex,</hi> untill Sir <hi>William Walworth</hi> than Lord Mayor of <hi>London</hi> did with his Dagger stabbe <hi>Iacke Straw</hi> in <hi>Smith-field,</hi> whereupon the Dagger was set in the Armes of <hi>London.</hi> The rebellion for <hi>Perkin Warbek</hi> was soone disanimated, and the Imposture discovered, and so likewise <hi>Iack Cade</hi> and his associates were soone confounded and overthrowne, and punished according to their Deserts. And thus Rebellion is like that <hi>Ignis fatuus</hi> or that phantastick apparition of fire, which running under hedges doth affright Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>people, but having blazed a while, it is soone dissipated and extinguished. The <hi>Scots</hi> therefore cannot promise to themselves any better fortune than their rebellious Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessours, who were soone scatter'd and confounded, and their leaders received condigne punishment. If therefore any precise Humorist that accounts himselfe a transcendant Protestant, and a <hi>Goliah</hi> in Religion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when indeed he is an Hypocriticall Puritane, if any such doe thinke the complaint of <hi>Time</hi> against the <hi>Scots</hi> is too Satyricall<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I would have him know, that the Rebellion of the <hi>Scots</hi> as it is haynous in its owne nature, and deserves a sharpe vindication and revenge, so it also hath cast an aspersion vpon <hi>Time,</hi> for both the City and Country doe find fault, that it is a very hard, dangerous and doubtfull <hi>Time.</hi> And some in regard of this unnaturall Rebellion say, <hi>Time</hi> declines and growes worse, and that many discentions, Divisions and Rebellions shall happen in the old Age of <hi>Time,</hi> unto all which accusations <hi>Time</hi> doth make answere with one old ancient Verse<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
