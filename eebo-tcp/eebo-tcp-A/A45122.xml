            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>AN
ANSWER
TO
Dr. Stillingfleet, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>IN Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet</hi>'s Book, there is one thing I
meet with, that I perhaps can better tell how,
than another, to Answer. It is in his Preface,
where he is going about to make the Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conformists
a kind of Parties with the Papists, as if
they were joyning with them for the bringing in of
Popery; and for the proof of this, he produces one
Evidence. I will set down his own words, and Ans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
the Allegation.</p>
            <q>
               <p>
                  <hi>In</hi> Ann. Dom. 1675. <hi>there was a Book printed, En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tituled,</hi>
The Peaceable designe, or an Account of the Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conformists
Meetings, by some Ministers of London. <hi>In it,
an Objection is thus put:</hi> But what shall we say then to
the Papists? <hi>His Answer is,</hi> The Papist, in our Account,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:45622:3"/>
is but one sort of Recusants, &amp; the Conscientious &amp; Peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
among them, must be held in the same Predicament with
those among ourselves, that likewise refuse to come to Common-Prayer.
<hi>What is this but Joyning for a Toleration
of Popery? If this be not plain enough, these words
follow;</hi> But as for the Common-Papist, who lives Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently
in his way, he is to Us as other Separatists; and so
he comes under the like Toleration.</p>
               <p>This notable Book, with some few Additions &amp;
Alterations, hath been since Printed, &amp; with great
sincerity called, <hi>An Answer to my Sermon.</hi> And the
Times being Changed since, the former passage is
thus Altered: <hi>The Papists is one whose Worship to Us is
Idolatry, and we cannot therefore allow them the Liberty of
Publick Assembling themselves as others of the Separation.</hi>
Is it Idolatry, and not to be Tolerated in 1680?
And was it Idolatry, &amp; to be Tolerated in 1675?
Or, Was it no Idolatry then, but is become so now,
and intolerable Idolatry too? The latter passage
hath these Alterations; Instead of <hi>He is to Us as other
Separatists, and so comes under the like Toleration,</hi> These
are put in, <hi>He is to Us (in regard of what he doth in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate,
in the matter of his God) as other who refuse to come
to Common-Prayer.</hi> Now we see Toleration struck
out for the Papists, but it was not only visible e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
before, but that very book was Printed with
a design to present it to the Parliament, which was
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:45622:3"/>
the highest way of owning their Concurrence with
the Papists for a general Toleration: And the true
Reason of this Alteration is, that Then was Then,
and Now is Now.</p>
            </q>
            <p>For the Answering this Evidence. In the first
place, this Book the Doctor mentions, was drawn
up by <hi>One</hi> man (though put out by <hi>Others)</hi> and the
first Mistake of the Doctor is, to lay a Charge on the
<hi>Party</hi> of the Nonconformists, for a passage which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
concerns but <hi>One person</hi> only.</p>
            <p>In the next place, the Reason of bringing that pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage
into the Book was, because the <hi>Objection</hi> is so
Obvious it could not be <hi>Baulkt;</hi> and the Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
appearing to the Author Undeniable, he
thought it but <hi>Honest</hi> to yeild it. The Doctor then
is mistaken next, that believes (or pretends) the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of the bringing in that passage, was on purpose
only to Favour, or fall In with the Papists. That
which is said in <hi>Right</hi> to <hi>All,</hi> ought not to be inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted
in <hi>Favour</hi> to <hi>Any.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the Third place, for the Alteration mentioned,
it is to be known, that when the Author had drew
up this Book, he left it with a Non-conformist
Doctor to shew it to his Brethren; who return'd it
after a while, telling him, That they Disliked some
passages in it; which made him put it into some other
hands, who afterwards, while he was Absent, prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:45622:4"/>
it. They altered nothing, but when it came
out, the Author indeed found his Brethren Offended
at some things, and that passage most obnoxious to
Exception: so that he presenrly made his Emenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and seeing the Book ill Printed, intended in
time to have another Impression. Upon this, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
the Doctor is again Mistaken, in regard to this
Alteration which he Quotes, who judges the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of the Change, to be only because of the Times.
<hi>The True Reason</hi> (sayes he) <hi>is, because Then was Then,
and Now is Now.</hi> The <hi>True Reason,</hi> as if he knew it,
when you see how perfectly he is out in his Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
as well as his Conjectures. The making the
Emendations which he did, at the present Season, is a
Demonstration. The Nonconformists are here Sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
or Impeached by this Doctor, for <hi>Favouring</hi>
&amp; <hi>Ioyning</hi> with the <hi>Papists,</hi> because of a <hi>passage</hi> in that
Book; when the very Reason of <hi>Altering</hi> that <hi>passage</hi>
was, because of their presumed <hi>Finding Fault</hi> with it.</p>
            <p>In the Last place, we have here, not only a <hi>Mistake</hi>
in the Doctor (which might be born) but an open
<hi>Wrong</hi> or <hi>Injury,</hi> if it be not want of Consideration.
The Doctor Thinks, or Speaks, as if the Author (in
<hi>Re-printing</hi> the Book) had Changed his Opinion;
wherein I count he most of all is Out, and most to
Blame. He who drew up the Book, is not one of
that Humour, as to Turn with the Times, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:45622:4"/>
against them. The Opinion he offered in the
Year 75, is the same with what he holds now in the
Year 80. Here is an Alteration indeed as to <hi>more
Words,</hi> or some <hi>other</hi> words, but the <hi>same Opinion</hi>
or Solution, with the Difference only of a farther
<hi>Explication</hi> of it, and nothing else therein (besides
avoiding offence) entended. The Author had been
wary in declaring the <hi>Toleration</hi> he proposed to
be a <hi>Limited</hi> one, and provided against the <hi>Iesuite</hi>
upon reason of <hi>State,</hi> and shewed his dread of
<hi>Popery</hi> in <hi>Dominion,</hi> but had omitted the distinction
of a toleration in regard to <hi>Publick</hi> Assemblies,
and the <hi>Private</hi> exercise of a Man's own Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
He explains himself therefore by way of sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply,
signifying that what he said at first, should
be taken in regard to the tolerating the <hi>Papist</hi> only
privately, as his meaning really was then, and
is now but fullier expressed. This is the <hi>Opinion</hi>
he recedes not from (whether <hi>peculiar</hi> to himself or
not) that <hi>No Man should be persecuted meerly for his
Conscience, if there be no other Reason.</hi> Whether a
Man be a <hi>Dissenter</hi> of <hi>one</hi> kind, or of <hi>another, The
Common Rule of Christianty must be remembred</hi> (he sayes)
<hi>still, that we do to all Men, as we would be done by, and that
with what Measure we mete to others, it shall be met to us
again.</hi> These Words remain in all the Impressions.</p>
            <p>And now for the <hi>Title,</hi> I have this also to An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer.
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:45622:5"/>
The Book as it came out <hi>An.</hi> 75. was
then gone, and now Re-printed against the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
Sate; but they not Sitting, was laid by
till the Doctor's Sermon comming out, it was
thought <hi>Seasonable.</hi> The Doctor Charges the <hi>Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conformists</hi>
Meetings with Schisme. This Book
gives an account of their Meetings, and Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicates
them from Schisme: and forasmuch,
as something was Inserted in regard to the <hi>Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi>
(whom his Charge mainly concerns) when
the <hi>Ministers</hi> only were Vindicated in the First Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and the first Sheet was new Printed over
on purpose, and the Doctor named, it was sent
out with <hi>this also</hi> in the <hi>Title.</hi> There was no Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealment
that it was a former Book, it was still
call'd <hi>The Peaceable Design,</hi> and said to be <hi>Renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;</hi>
but there was this Addition, and this Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.
And so I have given an Account of Doctor
<hi>Stillingfleet</hi>'s Book, so far as concerns that Author;
and do not doubt, but the Doctor will have an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
also from others so far as it concerns them,
in due Season. As Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> Mr. <hi>Alsop,</hi> Dr. <hi>Owen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And here I had thought to have given over,
and got one of these Friends to have put so much
for me in one of their Books: but when I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
there is a <hi>Postscript</hi> to the last Impression of
the Book mentioned, and what there is said, and
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:45622:5"/>
with what openness; I must needs say, that I did
expect something from a Candid person, more
like a Gentleman; that is, so much Ingenuity as
to cover a Fault which was confessed, rather than
expose it, if there were any: but I see there is
nothing of this Nature, no such Ingenuity I thought,
to be expected from the Doctor.</p>
            <p>I am sensible of his Spirit, and that temper
I observe in him, from a few Words let out of
his Soul here and there, in this Ironical Way of
his, which is a sufficient Indication of what kind
of Estimation he hath of himself, in his contempt
of others. I will give one instance in a place
somewhere, where he is speaking of Mr. <hi>Alsop.</hi>
He begins his Sentence, <hi>This Learned Man,</hi> but
before he ends it, he tells us of an <hi>Admirable Peice
of his Reading:</hi> so that when I was thinking him
to be in earnest, I find it only to disdain him.
I do therefore hate such a counterfeit Epithet as this
is, and these fleering Expressions. It is all one in good
earnest, as if he should more at large speak thus
to his Readers. Readers, you may perhaps think
that Mr. <hi>Alsop</hi> is a Learned Man; but alass, What
is he in comparison of me? I am the Man that
have all Learning in me. 'Tis I have done such
Feats, especially against the <hi>Papists.</hi> I am the Man
that have Kill'd the <hi>Philistine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:45622:6"/>
I forbear to mention a place where he Treats
this same Worthy Man, after the rate, as if he
were some Person distraught, which is a vile Abuse,
but that is not the thing I Note.</p>
            <p>Another Instance I must not forbear, in regard
to Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> and it is this, That when he at
first names that Good Man, he tells us he <hi>Pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi>
him. Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> belike, is one scarce wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of the Doctors <hi>Conquest,</hi> but fit for his <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion.</hi>
And can the Doctor here be in good ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest?
Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> certainly is not an Enemy so
Contemptible, nor the Doctor I hope quite so
<hi>Elated,</hi> as he is <hi>Idle.</hi> The Doctor is one who
may look on himself to have Abilities in some
regard, which Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> hath not; but if he
should really value himself mith Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the account of a <hi>Profound Divine</hi> (which one
may think here he would be at), he is a Man
who must want that Modesty in <hi>good Earnest,</hi>
whereof he makes a <hi>Shew</hi> in the Beginning of
his Book, upon a Comparison of his with <hi>Iewel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Doctor hath Learning, and hath apt
Words, and is a ready sufficient Man: but Mr.
<hi>Baxter</hi> is really a Man Extraordinary, and
whose Talents are of another sort, than the
Doctors can reach unto. Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> is one, I
will say, like the Man in the Neighbourhood,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:45622:6"/>
who is first up, and all the Neighbours come for Fire
to his House: that is, one from whom the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
Age do fetch <hi>Light,</hi> and unto whom the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
to come will bring <hi>Honour.</hi> Neither care
I for any Bodies saying this is <hi>Odious,</hi> for the <hi>Old-Proverb</hi>
shall not hinder me to end the Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison.
The <hi>Doctor</hi> is one as well as others who
may be willing to <hi>Learn</hi> (or else I am sure be
will have the more need to be <hi>Taught)</hi> of that
Man whom he <hi>Pitties.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is fit after I have said this, that I make it
good. And there is a Dispute between these
Two, concerning the National Church, will help
me to do it. If there be a National Church,
it must have a Head, a <hi>Constitutive-Head,</hi> sayes
Mr. <hi>Baxter:</hi> and therefore asks the <hi>Doctor</hi> where
the <hi>Constitutive Regent part</hi> of the Church of <hi>Eng-</hi>
is to be placed? It is a matter of <hi>Polity</hi> the <hi>Doctor</hi>
is put upon: The <hi>Question</hi> also seems something
<hi>Perplext,</hi> it may be on purpose to try the <hi>Doctor,</hi>
but this we find, the <hi>Doctor</hi> is posed, that is flat,
for he cannot Answer, but is driven to say there
is no such Head, and that there is no need of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny;
which is the Absurdity unto which the Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponent
would drive him. If ever any Boy
in the higher Form at School, was posed by
his Master, the <hi>Doctor</hi> here is posed, who is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:45622:7"/>
in Mr. <hi>Baxter's</hi> Hands, no other but such
a one, when he takes him on such a point, where
his Books, and Polite Style do not serve him.</p>
            <p>That there is a Government in the Church of
<hi>England,</hi> I hope the <hi>Doctor</hi> does not doubt, who
pleads for Conformity to it. Where there is a
Government established, there must be a Politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Society; Every Political Body consists of a
<hi>Pars Imperans &amp; subdita.</hi> Does, or does not the
<hi>Doctor</hi> know this? If the Church of <hi>England</hi> then
be a Political Church, it must have a Regent
part, and this <hi>Constitutive Regent part</hi> must be As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Doctor</hi> here is indeed something more Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate
in his Reading, than he uses, or else
it need not be so hard for any, to find out, where
the Head, or Regent part of every Political Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
is, or must be placed, whether Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>
contradicts it or not. There are therefore cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<hi>Rights of Soveraignty, Iura Magistatis</hi> (as Writers
of Politicks do call them) or <hi>Prerogatives,</hi> and
where those <hi>Rights</hi> are invested, there the <hi>Head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship</hi>
must be placed. The chief of these <hi>Rights</hi> is
<hi>Legislation.</hi> Wheresoever then the Power of giving
Laws to any Society is found, there must this
<hi>Constitutive Regent part,</hi> which Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> enquires
for; be Assigned. The Church of <hi>England,</hi> now
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:45622:7"/>
we know, hath Her Laws: There are Laws <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical,</hi>
and these are called <hi>Canons,</hi> or <hi>Constitutions.</hi>
We must then enquire where it is, the Power of
Making <hi>these</hi> does lye. And here we find, that
the <hi>Arch-Bishop</hi> of the <hi>Province,</hi> with the <hi>Bish<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ps</hi>
and <hi>Clerks</hi> making up a <hi>Convocation,</hi> do frame these
<hi>Canons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If the <hi>Doctor</hi> now could but prove, That the
Hierarchy of the Church thus Congregated, were
certainly of Divine Institution, so that there need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
no other Authority, but of the <hi>Convocation</hi>
only, for their Ratification; then could he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
assign to us such a Head as Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>
seeks. But forasmuch as there is no Authority in
the <hi>Convocation</hi> when they have Composed their
<hi>Canons,</hi> to Impose any of them upon the Church,
or to oblige the Conscience of any by them, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til
they are ratifyed by the Authority of the King;
it is manifest both that this Hierarchy of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is but of Human Right, and that the King
alone (the Power of Legislation, which proves it,
lying only in him) is, and must be, the Head of
the Church, in this Kingdom.</p>
            <p>And that this certainly is so, it is declared in
the Statute of <hi>Henry the Eighth,</hi> That the <hi>King shall
be taken for the only Supream Head of the Church,</hi>
called <hi>Ecclesia Anglicana.</hi> To understand this, The
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:45622:8"/>
Church may be consid<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>red, we are to know, as
<hi>Universal,</hi> and so is <hi>Christ</hi> the Head of it, and
can only give Laws to it: Or as <hi>Particular,</hi> and
so the Pastors are Heads, and Rule it: Or as
<hi>National,</hi> (to wit, as it is according to the Statute
<hi>Ecclesia Anglicana)</hi> and so the Magistrate is Head,
and makes Laws for it.</p>
            <p>I will add; There is something <hi>Essential</hi> to the
Church of <hi>Christ,</hi> and something <hi>Accidental.</hi> That
there should be Persons, who Meet to Worship
<hi>God</hi> and <hi>Christ,</hi> and be put in Order for it, is of
<hi>Christ</hi>'s Appointment, and Necessary to his Church.
Of these <hi>Particular</hi> Persons and Churches, the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick</hi>
Church consists. To be <hi>Particular</hi> then, or
<hi>Universal,</hi> is of <hi>Essential</hi> Consideration to <hi>Christ</hi>'s
Church: But to be <hi>National,</hi> is of <hi>Accidental</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration.
That all the People of a Land should
be Christian, and the Magistrate also, is (I say)
an Accidental thing to the Church, which may
Exist where that is not: Upon which account,
though the Magistrate be none of <hi>Christ</hi>'s proper
Officers, yet may he be Head of his Church, and
Constitutive Head of it, as undet his Dominions,
because he is Head not in any <hi>Essential,</hi> but in this
<hi>Accidental</hi> Consideration of it.</p>
            <p>I will now set down the <hi>Doctor</hi>'s own Words. Pag.
301. <hi>We deny any Necessity of any such Constitutive Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:45622:8"/>
Part, or one Formal Ecclesiastical Head, as Essential to
a National-Church. For a National Consent is as suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
to make a National-Church, as an Universal-Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
to make a Catholick-Church.</hi> In this Determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Point, when the <hi>Doctor</hi> denyes any
Necessity of such a Head, I hope, he is not so
frivolous, as to believe One in this Nation, and
not to tell it. So long as the Church of <hi>England</hi>
is a Political Church, and hath a Government e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablish't,
it must have its <hi>Regent</hi> Part, as well
as the Part <hi>Ruled;</hi> and to deny the Necessity of
<hi>One,</hi> is all one as to say there is <hi>None.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I press the <hi>Doctor:</hi> Is it a Political-Church, or
no? If it be, he must find it a Head: If it be
not, then it is only a Community of Christians,
amongst whom, it must be supposed, there is no
Government (as yet) introduced; and then shall
our Ecclesiastical Laws, Canons, and Constituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
our Bishops and Arch-Bishops, with the whole.
Constitution we have already, be hurled in the
Dust. The <hi>Doctor</hi> will be a fine Champion for
the Church, if he persists to say this.</p>
            <p>We deny any Necessity of any such Constitutive Regent
Part, or one Formal Ecclesiastical Head, as Essential to
a National-Church. <hi>The</hi> Doctor <hi>here,</hi> who is posed
<hi>with the</hi> Question, <hi>is</hi> confounded <hi>with the</hi> Terms. <hi>He
should distinguish between a</hi> He<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d, <hi>and a</hi> Formal
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:45622:9"/>
Ecclesiastical Head; <hi>a</hi> Regent Part, <hi>and an</hi> Ecclesiastical
Regent Part; <hi>a</hi> Constitutive Regent Part, <hi>and a</hi> Formal
Ecclesiastical Head <hi>of the Church of</hi> England. <hi>Though a</hi>
National-<hi>Church hath no</hi> Ecclesiastical <hi>Head, it hath a</hi>
Head, <hi>a</hi> Regent Part, <hi>a</hi> Constitutive Regent Part, <hi>under
this</hi> Accidental <hi>Consideration of the Church as</hi> Natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,
<hi>though not under the</hi> Essential <hi>Consideration of
it as the</hi> Church of Christ.</p>
            <p>If the <hi>Doctor</hi> had light upon it in some of his
Books, that the King of <hi>England</hi> represents Two
Persons, an <hi>Ecclesiastical</hi> Person while He presides
by His Authority in the <hi>Convocation,</hi> and so is Head
of the <hi>Church;</hi> and a <hi>Civil</hi> Person, while He sits
with the <hi>Parliament,</hi> and so is Head of the <hi>State,</hi>
and upon the account of both, the Fountain
of all Obligation upon the Subject, both from
the <hi>Canons</hi> of the Church, and <hi>Statutes</hi> of the Realm,
I cannot tell how he might have put Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>
to it: But so long as the <hi>King</hi> is not indeed both
Supream Magistrate, and High-Priest, as the <hi>Mac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cabees</hi>
were, and neither of them think otherwise
of the King, than Magistrate only, (that is, Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream
Coercive Governour) it is this which is
here said, must be the Expedient to remove the
Bone from between them.</p>
            <p>It is said in Scripture, That <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Queens</hi>
shall be <hi>Nursing-Fathers</hi> and <hi>Nursing-Mothers</hi> to the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:45622:9"/>
Church. As they are <hi>Fathers,</hi> they are <hi>Heads:</hi> As
<hi>Nursing-Fathers,</hi> it shews their Power is not <hi>Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal</hi>
to the Church, but <hi>External,</hi> as Divines speak,
that is of another kind than that which is proper
to Spiritual Fathers, the Pastors, or <hi>Christ</hi>'s own
Officers. The Authority of Kings over the Church,
is <hi>Objective,</hi> (they say, <hi>Circa Sacra)</hi> not <hi>Formal:</hi>
That is, it is Objectively Ecclesiastical, and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally
Civil. And as this is so, I apprehend in
like manner, that the Society of Christians in a
Nation (as the whole Nation are such) is <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectively</hi>
a <hi>Church,</hi> and <hi>Formally</hi> a <hi>Kingdom,</hi> or <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Wealth
of Christians;</hi> and so may the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Magistrate be the Constitutive Regent Part of
it.</p>
            <p>Well! But what Argument hath the <hi>Doctor</hi> to
prove that there is no necessity for a National
Church, to have a Constitutive Head, essential to
it; that is essential to it, not as the Church of <hi>Christ;</hi>
but under a National Consideration? He hath no
Argument, but brings another Instance, and that is
of the <hi>Catholick</hi> Church visible, which he saith, hath
no Head neither. The <hi>Doctor</hi> is miserably driven
to the Wall, when he is driven hither. There was
never any <hi>Protestant</hi> doubted, but that <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> is
the Head of the <hi>Catholick</hi> Church; and if he be the
Head of it as <hi>Universal,</hi> he must be the Head of it,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:45622:10"/>
whether <hi>Visible</hi> or <hi>Invisible.</hi> But <hi>Christ is not</hi> (sayes
he) <hi>a Visible Head.</hi> Poor! If this were true, it is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
that he is the Head of those who are Visible:
but yet he is out even in this, for though <hi>Christ</hi> be
not <hi>Caput Visum,</hi> he is <hi>Caput Visibile.</hi> He is not seen
on Earth, but he is seen in Heaven. Nay, he was
seen on Earth by <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Stephen,</hi> and will Appear
as he is at the Great Day.</p>
            <p>And what thinks the <hi>Doctor</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> before his As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cension;
was he Head then? Nay, did not <hi>Christ</hi>
while upon Earth give Laws for his Church, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point
Officers, and Commission his Apostles to ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Christian Societies in the World? And is not his
Government over them, a Visible Ecclesiastical
Government, where the Officers are Visible, and
the Members Visible; and is not he the Head then
of the Church Visible? Are not making Laws, and
Appointing Officers, the Rights of a Head?</p>
            <p>When that Article was put in the <hi>Creed, I Believe
the Catholick Church;</hi> I would ask the <hi>Doctor,</hi> Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
this Distinction of <hi>Visible</hi> and <hi>Invisible</hi> was used
in the World? And if it was not, when it arose, it
could not take off any thing of <hi>Christ</hi>'s Headship.
When both Visible and Invisible were but one, he
must be Head of both. Again, there are some
Learned Men deny a <hi>Catholick</hi> Church Visible. The
<hi>Doctor</hi> does hold it. And what if they should ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:45622:10"/>
against him this Argument? If there be no
<hi>Catholick</hi> Visible Head, there is no <hi>Catholick</hi> Church
Visible. But there is no <hi>Catholick</hi> Visible Head. The
<hi>Minor</hi> is the <hi>Doctors,</hi> and the <hi>Major</hi> is to be denyed
of no other but the <hi>Doctor.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let us proceed to the bottom. We have soun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
the <hi>Doctors</hi> Invention; let us try his Reason.
<hi>There is no necessity of such a Head</hi> (sayes he) <hi>for a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
Consent is as sufficient to make a National Church, as
an Universal Consent to make a</hi> Catholick <hi>Church. This
is the Doctors Reason.</hi> It is Consent alone makes a
Church or Society, though it hath no Head. The
Consent of a <hi>Nation</hi> makes a <hi>National</hi> Church, the
Consent of <hi>All Christians</hi> the <hi>Catholick</hi> Church, the
Consent of a <hi>Particular Company,</hi> a <hi>Particular</hi> Church
or Congregation. This is his bottom, and it is
something, but exceeding rawly spoken.</p>
            <p>Let us understand therefore, where there is a
company of Persons, who have no power one over
another, that might receive mutual Advantage, if
United to that end; such a Company are called a
<hi>Community.</hi> If they agree together for the obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of that end, to come into an Order of Superio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
and Inferiority, that makes it a Society, or Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical
Body. If the end be for that good which is
only <hi>Temporal,</hi> it is called a <hi>Common-Wealth:</hi> if for that
which is <hi>Spiritual,</hi> it is a <hi>Church.</hi> The <hi>Doctor</hi> now is
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:45622:11"/>
to be askt, What Consent it is that he means?</p>
            <p>If he means by his Consent, the Agreement
which People make at first, when they enter into
Society, it is true, that their Consent is the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
but the <hi>Doctor</hi> here I hope does see that this
Consent is for the having a Head, and Government,
and the pitching upon the Sort, or Manner of the
Government they would have; which Agreement
is called the <hi>Constitution.</hi> It is not this Consent there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the <hi>Doctor</hi> should mean, which is not also ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicable
to the <hi>Catholick</hi> Church (in which he Instances)
whose Head and Government is not of Mans Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
but of the Will of <hi>God</hi> only.</p>
            <p>By the way for the <hi>National</hi> Church, It is true,
that Particular Churches in a Nation, being of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Appointment, the Pastors or Ministers who have
the Rule over their Flocks <hi>In Actu Primo,</hi> that is,
the <hi>Right</hi> of Discipline and Censure, may agree to
a delegating that power <hi>In Actu Secundo,</hi> or the <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise</hi>
of it (for Reasons of Prudence) to a Superin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendent,
called a <hi>Bishop,</hi> who shall be Supervised
by an <hi>Arch-Bishop;</hi> and that the <hi>Arch-Bishop, Bishops,</hi>
and <hi>Clerks,</hi> chosen out of themselves, met in a <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation,</hi>
shall have the Power of making Laws, or
<hi>Canons,</hi> by which they will be Governed. Upon
such a Consent, as this here appears a Political Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
Church in the <hi>Constitution,</hi> wherein is an
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:45622:11"/>
Ecclesiastical Formal Constitutive Regent Part, or
Head over an Organical Body for the <hi>Administrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
and that founded upon the true Bottom, upon
which all rightly constituted Societies do stand, the
Agreement of the Community. The Regent Part
here is placed not in <hi>One Person</hi> (which does not
need) but in <hi>One Corporation,</hi> or United Assembly,
whereof the Arch-Bishop is but a chief part, as the
Bishops are: and I would humbly ask Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>
what he thinks of it. For as for the <hi>Doctor,</hi> I think
not him a Competent Judge, not so much because
he is not versed in that sort of Study, as the other
is; but because of his departure from himself in the
Prudentials of his <hi>Irenicum,</hi> and being thereby now
engaged to maintain the Government of our Church
to be of Divine Right, he must not receive this No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which, let it shew him never so clear and firm
a Ground to build the same upon, does make it of
<hi>Human Institution.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If by his consent, he means the consent of every
Man in particular, to be of such a Church or Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
it is true that a Mans consent does make him a
Member, so as without it he could be none: but
the Church or Society, must be supposed to be <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med</hi>
before of the <hi>Ruling,</hi> and <hi>Ruled</hi> Part, and his
Consent to be a Member, is a consent to be Ruled,
and to own such a <hi>Head,</hi> as well as to enjoy the <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits</hi>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:45622:12"/>
of such a <hi>Society.</hi> This Consent is the <hi>Condition</hi>
upon which he hath right to be a Member, it is the
<hi>Ratio Fundandi</hi> of his Membership, and the <hi>Condition</hi>
upon which the Ruler hath Authority over him in
particular (when we suppose he may otherwise be
at his own choice): but if a Man shall fancy that
this Consent does make a Church or Society, as the
<hi>Form</hi> that <hi>Constitutes</hi> it, as they must do, who sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
a Society to be <hi>Made, Formed,</hi> or <hi>Constituted,</hi> by
this Consent without a Head, or the necessity of
one; it is such a raw, injudicious, indigested Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception,
as could have never once swum in the
Thoughts of so Learned a Person, if he had a facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
for beating out a Notion, so good as he has for
Books, and negligence toward others that endeavour
it.</p>
            <p>It is true, there is no Political Society, whether
Civil or Ecclesiastical, but there must be Consent
and Union; but it is not this Consent, and Union
only makes it a Church or Common-Wealth. A
Vicinity may have Concord, nay a Herd; and there
is Consent in a Society in <hi>Fieri,</hi> not yet Organiz'd, or
Unform'd. There is something that gives the Name
and Being, and makes a Society to be that which
it is, <hi>in specie</hi> different from others, which is not I say
Consent, but it is an Order of Superiority and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriority
upon Consent, that does this; and that is all
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:45622:12"/>
one, as to be the Form that Constitutes the Society:
And Consequently, when I find the <hi>Doctor</hi> (being
at last drawn to it) come to such a Determination
as this about the Point, that <hi>There is no necessity of a
Constitutive Head, because a National Consent makes a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
Church,</hi> I must pronounce it such a grave No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
such a speaking Nothing with Gravity, and
pretence of being Wiser too than his fellows, that
if he do not come to be ashamed before Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>
has done with him, or has reason to be so, I will
be exposed to shame my self for my speaking thus
freely, plainly, and honestly, as another person
perhaps would not do.</p>
            <p>The truth is, it is pity the <hi>Doctor</hi> did declare his
Heart while he was Young against the Divine Right
of Episcopacy, seeing he hath occasion now for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
Opinion. Whether out of Prudence or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
whether for want of more Light then, or
more full Light now; it is <hi>God,</hi> and himself knows,
and I Judge not. But I do perceive this, that it
hath exposed him much, and that not only to such
a sawcy Man as Mr. <hi>Alsop,</hi> to style him <hi>This Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-Cock:</hi>
but to such a serious Man as Mr. <hi>Baxter;</hi>
to drive him into such distress. For so long (I must
still say) as the <hi>Doctor</hi> is engaged to hold the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of Episcopacy, as it is exercised in the
Church of <hi>England,</hi> to be of Divine Right; he must
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:45622:13"/>
maintain also her proper Constituting Officers to be
of <hi>Christs</hi> appointment, and then find out a Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Head of it, or he is gone. And seeing he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
do this, but is forced to grant there is no such
Head, and that there is no need of any, it is plain
that his Cause is lost.</p>
            <p>I will sum up my Answer again. The <hi>Doctor</hi>'s
Determination is, <hi>We deny the necessity of any such Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
Part. For a National Consent is as sufficient to make
a National Church, as an Universal Consent to make a</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
<hi>Church.</hi> It is well he sayes, <hi>As Sufficient,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause,
<hi>That</hi> may excuse him something, if neither
of them be Sufficient, as it appears they are not
without a Head. I have distinguished therefore two
Consents. A Consent that goes to the <hi>Making</hi> a
Society or Church; and a Consent for coming into
the same, when it is <hi>Made.</hi> A Consent that goes to
the <hi>Constitution,</hi> and a Consent, that goes to put a
Man under the <hi>Administration.</hi> When the <hi>Doctor</hi>
Argues from the <hi>Catholick,</hi> to a <hi>National</hi> Church; that,
As an Universal Consent makes the <hi>Catholick</hi> Church:
So a National Consent the National Church; he
must not be understood to mean it of the <hi>Former</hi>
Consent, because there is no such Consent as that
imaginable, in regard to the <hi>Catholick</hi> Church.
There can be no coming together possibly of the
Community of the whole Christian World, to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:45622:13"/>
to such a Constitution. The <hi>Catholick Church</hi> is
not made by the consent of men, but is of God's
Ordination altogether. Nor can he be understood
of the <hi>Latter</hi> consent, because a consent to be a Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of a Church or Society already <hi>Made,</hi> is not that
consent which goes to the <hi>Making</hi> it.</p>
            <p>A consent to be a <hi>Christian,</hi> or of the <hi>Church Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick,</hi>
is to consent to have Christ for my Lord and
Head. But how a consent to have Christ for ones
Head, should prove that <hi>Consent</hi> makes a Church
without a <hi>Head,</hi> is a reasoning I am yet to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand.
For the <hi>former consent,</hi> there is here none of it:
And from the <hi>latter,</hi> there can be no Argument.</p>
            <p>Again, The <hi>Catholick Church Visible</hi> in its Nature,
can never be Organical. It hath a Head, and all the
Particular Churches in the Earth, are the parts of it.
Nay, there were at first, Universal Officers, gifted
with proper Gifts, as the Gifts of Tongues, sutable
to such an Office: But these were only to gather
Particular Churches throughout the World; and it
never was the designe of the Head, that there should
be a Form of Polity introduced into an Oecumenical
Society, that by the Organs of Bishops, Arch-Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops,
Patriarchs, General Councils, and a Pope, a
<hi>Catholick Visible Government</hi> should be Administred so,
as to make the whole Earth a <hi>Political Church.</hi> And
consequently, the Doctors Arguing from the <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick</hi>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:45622:14"/>
to a <hi>National Church,</hi> cannot be good. Not only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
there is no such <hi>Constitution</hi> as this by <hi>consent</hi>
imaginable (which I shall say principally) as to the
<hi>Catholick Church</hi> (The True Head of this Church being
not <hi>chosen</hi> by Man's <hi>consent,</hi> and the False Head, I
hope, we are never like to <hi>choose):</hi> But because, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
supposition that the Doctors <hi>Consent</hi> (some way
or other as he means) did make it, he must suppose
this <hi>Universal Church,</hi> as such, to be on Earth, a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat
Organized Body, or he must make the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal
Church an In-organical Body; and by either
way he drops his <hi>Cause.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I do now wonder therefore at the Doctor, what
these first Apprehensions of something indeed, he
knew not what, in his mind, should mean. How
a man, whose Parts are so great, should be so slender
in his Reasonings; and why he should undertake the
Resolution of such a Point, as he is no body at, at all.</p>
            <p>The Doctor certainly has no reason therefore,
to insult over any body, or contemn any, and
much less to <hi>Pity</hi> Mr. <hi>Baxter;</hi> which <hi>Pity,</hi> by inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation,
is <hi>Slight.</hi> Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> is a man that is not
to be <hi>Pityed,</hi> nor indeed to be <hi>Envied;</hi> for we usually
don't aspire to be equal to Singular persons. The
Doctor has his Excellencies other ways, but he hath
not Mr. <hi>Baxter's.</hi> The Doctor's Soul is made of
<hi>Free-stone,</hi> you shall have from him <hi>Polished Learning;</hi>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:45622:14"/>
Mr. <hi>Baxter's</hi> is made of <hi>Flint,</hi> you shall have from
him <hi>Acute Truth.</hi> It is the Flint, not the Free-stone,
that strikes <hi>Light.</hi> A quick Apprehension; a d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

Judgment, a vast Invention; Exquisite Notion. A
Pen consequently, that is but turning the cock, and
it will run at any time a Sermon full, or a Book full,
as he hath Occasion. There is a Book I understand,
of his now sending out, which hath been many
a year in Study (He is usually too sudden); it is a
Methodical system of Divinity, fit for Students at
the University. I believe, that many of our Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal-Divines
will speak lightly of it, but not read
it; For my part, through his having this one Chief
Work, happily in Latin, I rejoyce from my heart,
that Forreign Divines who are not yet Prejudiced,
as Ours are, will come to know him. Above all
yet, Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> is a Holy Man, who will be for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
greater in his own <hi>Refusing</hi> a Bishoprick, than
the Doctor can be in <hi>Getting</hi> one; if the present ill
managing of this Cause does not preclude his having
any.</p>
            <p>And now, I could not Answer it to my self, if I
should leave this Discourse without returning to the
Matter, to make some Improvement of it. From this
piece of Doctrine then before (wherein I wonder
how the Doctor should stumble so at noon day)
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:45622:15"/>
that the <hi>Church of England</hi> is so far <hi>Erastian,</hi> that She
will not admit of Two <hi>Co-ordinate</hi> Powers with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
to the <hi>Church</hi> and the <hi>State</hi> of this Nation, but
doth choose to Own and Acknowledge the KING
to be the only Head of <hi>Both;</hi> we have a Dore open'd
for Union, which hath hardly been thought on by
any of those Pious and Learned men, whose Souls
heretofore have so much breathed after it.</p>
            <p>Archbishop <hi>Usher</hi> hath left us his Model for an
Accommodation: And it hath been upon the hearts
generally of all Moderate Persons, that a reduction
of such a Government into our Church, as was in
in the Primitive Times (when there was a <hi>Consessus
Presbyterorum</hi> joyn'd with the Bishop in all his Acts
of Ordination and Jurisdiction) were the Way, and
only Effectual Way to our True Happiness and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation.
Unto which, if one thing more might be
Added, that is, If the Common-Prayer might be
new <hi>Cast</hi> (it being fit, that such a <hi>Vessel</hi> for the <hi>Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary</hi>
should be all of <hi>Pure Gold)</hi> so as the whole of it
were composed of <hi>Scripture-Phrase</hi> altogether, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
nothing at all lyable any more to Exception,
unless the Imposition of a Form only (which I doubt
not but is also Justifiable by Scripture-Instances, as
well as Sound Reason) it might go near to put an
end to all Dissention among the Sober and Peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
of the Nation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:45622:15"/>
It is this I know is apt to recur into the Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of Good Men, and forasmuch as there was late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
two <hi>Bills</hi> prepared, for <hi>Comprehension</hi> (or Uniting
the <hi>Protestants),</hi> and for <hi>Indulgence</hi> (or repealing the
Penal Statutes); I shall not I hope incur any blame
if I apprehend that such Men who are most conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate,
and intent upon the Interest of <hi>God,</hi> in what
they seek, do, or did look upon either of such Bills,
as no other than an <hi>English Interim,</hi> preparative to
this Higher Concord, and Union of the Bishop with
his Presbyters, according to the Primitive Pattern
mentioned, as soon as more mellow opportunity,
and well advised Piety, should administer unto such
farther Perfection.</p>
            <p>Nevertheless, in regard there is no Uniting of a
Nation, can be supposed by any Model, but such
as is of <hi>H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

of Holy, and Learned Men in this Kingdom,
that do believe the way of their Gathered Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations,
is after a higher Pattern, than this of Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive
Episcopacy it self, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> there were any hope of
the return of it; it is manifest that there is no So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety
which is National in <hi>England,</hi> could be formed
on these terms, because these Congregational Men
can never recede from that which is of <hi>Divine Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment,</hi>
for the sake of any <hi>Antiquity</hi> whatsoever.
They do hold <hi>Particular</hi> Churches to be of <hi>Christ</hi>'s<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:45622:16"/>
and <hi>Diocesan</hi> of <hi>Ecclesiastical Consent</hi> only,
and under the Notion of <hi>Divine Right,</hi> it is Sin to
them, to Submit to any <hi>Bishop.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is another Notion then, that must be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced
to take in these Good Men of <hi>This Way,</hi> as
well as those of the <hi>Parochial</hi> and <hi>Diocesan</hi> Way, into
one Political Body, for the making up the <hi>National</hi>
Church of <hi>England,</hi> whereof the <hi>King</hi> is Head, as I
have been speaking: and that is by an Act of Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament,
<hi>Legitimating</hi> these <hi>Meetings</hi> of the <hi>Nonconfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mists,</hi>
so as to become thereby immediately <hi>Parts</hi> of
the Church, as <hi>National,</hi> no less than the <hi>Parochial</hi> As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies.
It was a good thing in the House of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
that they were about to free many Innocent
Men, from the danger of the <hi>Penal Statutes;</hi> but the
making such Meetings to be <hi>Legal,</hi> is a Design of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
Nature, of a far greater, nobler, and vast
Importance.</p>
            <p>The Nonconformist as well as Conformist, The
Congregationalist as well as Presbyterian, do
acknowledg the <hi>King</hi>'s Supremacy, and can take the
Oath. The one, as well as the other, therefore do
own an External Regiment of the Magistrate over
their Churches, so as to be punishable by him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for
any neglect of the Gospel Order, which themselves
profess; or for any Rules they make, or Things
they do, which are repugnant to the Peace of the
Kingdom.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:45622:16"/>
If it shall please the <hi>King</hi> consequently, to commit
any part of that Authority of his, which he hath <hi>Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca
Sacra,</hi> to be exercised by the Bishops, as Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astical
Magistrates under him, they can submit to a
Visitation under them, upon that account: though
they acknowledge them not to be <hi>Christs</hi> Officers,
bearing, or having any <hi>Internal</hi> Church-Power from
him, over them, or any other, but their own
Charge.</p>
            <p>Upon which account it appears further, how the
outward Dignity, and Grandeur of the Bishop need
not be Diminished, but enhaunced; and his Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intendency
extended over the <hi>Congregational,</hi> as well
as the <hi>Parochial</hi> Churches: Provided only, he will
but keep within his Line; that is the Line of the
<hi>King,</hi> and meddle not with <hi>Christ</hi>'s Jurisdiction.
Neither will they envy him his Barony, and sitting
in the Parliament.</p>
            <p>And if it should seem farther good here to a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
in one and the same Act, that Legitimates
such Meetings, to appoint that unto the two <hi>Clerks,</hi>
which are Elected by the Ministers of every Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess;
there should be one more chose by the <hi>Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gationalists,</hi>
likewise, for every Convocation; to joyn
with them in Consultation, that such Canons, and
such only may be framed, as tend to the propagati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of <hi>Holiness</hi> and <hi>Peace,</hi> throughout all the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,

see, how by this means, one <hi>Organ</hi> more should be
added to this great <hi>Political</hi> Society, for deriving an
influence from this Head, to these Parts of the Body,
as well as others, which now seem neglected, and
to have no care taken of them.</p>
            <p>And this brings into my mind, a Text of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle.
<hi>God hath tempered the Body together, having gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
abundant Honour to that part which lacked: That there
should be no Schisme in the Body, but that the Members
should have the same care of one another.</hi> From which
Text (if I may go a little about, to come the nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer
home) we may understand where the <hi>Core</hi> of that
<hi>Evil</hi> we call <hi>Schisme,</hi> does lye; and that is mainly in
the <hi>Want</hi> of that <hi>Love,</hi> and that <hi>Care</hi> which the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
owe one to another. It will follow, that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
they be, whether <hi>Conformist</hi> or <hi>Nonconformist,</hi>
who do care least for the Concord, and Edification
of the whole Body; those are like to be found most
Guilty of that Sin in the Sight of <hi>God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Nonconformist Minister does often come
to the Parish Church, but the Conformist Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister
comes never to his Meeting; and, Which
then of the Two, is the greater Separatist?</p>
            <p>The Meetings of the one, and of the other, as
they are <hi>Particular</hi> Churches, are Churches of
<hi>Christ,</hi> and <hi>Parts</hi> of the <hi>Universal,</hi> and so of <hi>Divine,</hi>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:45622:17"/>
through <hi>Quatenus Parochial,</hi> of <hi>Human</hi> Institution.
They both agree in the same <hi>Doctrine,</hi> and the same
<hi>Sacraments.</hi> They have one <hi>God,</hi> one <hi>Hope</hi> of our
Calling, one <hi>Lord,</hi> one <hi>Faith,</hi> one <hi>Baptism.</hi> They
differ somthing indeed in Opinion about the Church,
as to the external Constitution, and Discipline of
it, and about some Rites and Practices, which
makes them go into distinct Congregations. But
is their going only to two Meetings enough to make
Both, or Either of them, to be Guilty of this Sin of
Schisme?</p>
            <p>Separation I take it, in its self, simply considered,
is neither Good nor Evil; and there must be some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
that makes such a Separation to be Sinful, or
else it is not to be accounted Schisme. If a Man
shall Separate from the Parish Church, upon
the perswasion that those Churches are no true
Churches, I take such a Separation to be a high
breach of Charity, which must therefore render it
Sinful, and Consequently Schisme. If any shall
Separate out of Pride, Contention, or any the
like <hi>Sinful Cause,</hi> or to any <hi>Sinful End,</hi> as Worldly
<hi>Gain</hi> (for to some, <hi>Gain</hi> is <hi>Godliness),</hi> or <hi>Vain Glory:</hi>
this will make such a Separation to be still Sinful,
and so Schisme.</p>
            <p>It were the part then of such a <hi>Convocation</hi> before
mentioned, that is, of Ministers consisting of both
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:45622:18"/>
sorts, to be sure to agree upon this, That, Neither
Church (or any Members of Either) shall Unchurch
one another: and, That no Man should depart
from the <hi>One</hi> Church to the <hi>Other,</hi> but upon a sufficient
peaceable Reason, under the pain of Ecclesiastical
Censure.</p>
            <p>They should not permit any person unlearned,
till come to very grave Years (which are past Heat
and Ostentation) to Exercise in these Meetings:
They should decree the Doors of such Meetings to
be kept open, that the Magistrate may be secure a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
Sedition.</p>
            <p>They should determine many things of such a
Nature; but especially, that when a Man hath his
choice to be of what Congregation he will, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
to <hi>Fixed Communion,</hi> as he finds it most conducive
to his Souls Edification; yet should he be allowed,
and enjoyned to come <hi>Occasionally</hi> also to the <hi>Parish<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi>
Meetings (so far as he can in point of Conscience),
for the testifying his Union with the Body, as the
<hi>Church</hi> is <hi>National</hi> in this Kingdom. And I would
have persons likewise, who come for their Stated
Worship to the <hi>Parish Church,</hi> to go sometimes to the
<hi>Meetings</hi> also without scruple, by the way of <hi>Occasio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Communion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I will here deliver my own Soul. I know that
the <hi>Laws</hi> of the <hi>Magistrate</hi> that are <hi>Good,</hi> do <hi>Bind</hi> the
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:45622:18"/>
               <hi>Conscience:</hi> but there are two Cases that <hi>Loose</hi> a Man
from <hi>Obedience.</hi> One is, When that which is Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded,
is against his Conscience: and the Other
is, When that which is Commanded, is Superseded
by a Duty of greater concernment. I cannot say for
my part, that to go to Church, and hear Common-Prayer,
is against my Conscience; though a thorough
Conformity in all things, on the Ministers part, is
like still to be so; seeing the <hi>Doctor</hi> himself does
shrink from a Defence of the Lawfulness of <hi>That:</hi>
but this I can say, that when it is my duty to go to
<hi>Church,</hi> and my duty also to go <hi>Preach</hi> (supposing I
am called to one of these Meetings), the leaving un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done
that Duty, which is the <hi>Less,</hi> for the doing the
<hi>Other</hi> that can't be done otherwise, is no Sin, or Evil,
as I am perswaded in my Judgment. And it is up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Plea of the <hi>Greater Duty,</hi> that the <hi>Peaceable
Design</hi> does stand.</p>
            <p>I know well how my Brethren state <hi>Their</hi> Case,
They will have going to <hi>Their Meetings,</hi> to be for
their <hi>Fixed Communion;</hi> and allow <hi>Occasional Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
with the <hi>Parish Church,</hi> to defend themselves from
Schisme: but I, for my part must confess, that I see
not, and cannot see my <hi>Defence</hi> to be so <hi>Safe,</hi> unless
I take the <hi>Parish</hi> Assembly (where I have conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence)
for my <hi>Fixed</hi> Communion, and my <hi>Preaching</hi>
in the <hi>Meetings,</hi> and the Peoples going to them, to
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:45622:19"/>
be <hi>Occasional</hi> only, for our <hi>Greater</hi> or <hi>Farther</hi> Edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.
The <hi>Doctor</hi> therefore should indeed have
taken particular Notice of this, and Providing only
against such Preaching to be at that time, when
Publick Authority requires the General Attendance
otherwhere, he should, by giving an Approbation
to such a State of <hi>Our</hi> Cause, have consulted his <hi>Own,</hi>
both with more Judgment, and with more Modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
then for ought I see he hath done, or was able
to do.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Indeed if the Scene were altered, I need not be
so wary. If these</hi> Separate Assemblies <hi>were made</hi> Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal,
<hi>the Schisme presently, in reference to the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
Church were at an End.</hi> Schisme is a Separati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
from that Church, whereof we ought, or are bound to be
Members: If the Supreme Authority then loose our Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to the Parish Meeting, so that we are bound no longer,
the <hi>Iniquity</hi> upon that account, is not to be <hi>Found,</hi> and
the Schisme gone. <hi>It is one Act of Parliament would
give a full Answer, to all Mens Arguments.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the mean time, the Non-conformists I know,
have <hi>other</hi> Pleas besides <hi>One</hi> for what they do. They
think themselves bound in Conscience to <hi>Meet,</hi> and
<hi>Preach,</hi> and account it <hi>Serving God,</hi> and <hi>Doing</hi> their
<hi>Duty.</hi> The Doctor and others call it <hi>Sin</hi> and <hi>Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</hi>
When I Hear such Sayings therefore, and Read
such Books, I may still bear Reverence to the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:45622:19"/>
but I do not in my Heart, care one Penny for
what they say; for, there is a <hi>Conscience within</hi> quite
above such <hi>Words.</hi> They may cry, This is Schism;
<hi>There never was such Horrible Schism, as this Practise, heard
of, before in the Christian World</hi> sayes one very serious
Author, whom I name not: but I am not moved for
all that. I cannot think a <hi>Nonconformist Meeting</hi> such a
<hi>Horrible Creature</hi> (considering how our case in <hi>England</hi>
now stands) as these Church-Men generally would
make it. <hi>The great Bear</hi> (I must count still) <hi>hath been
lead so long about the Streets, that the very Children are no
longer afraid of it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Not but I am sensible of the dangerous conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
into which our Divisions may bring us; but
who can help it? Who is the <hi>Cause</hi> of them? <hi>Who is
in Fault,</hi> is the Question. Who is it can Remedy
these Terms imposed on us as necessary to Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion?
The <hi>Nonconformist</hi> hath no Conscience of Sin
upon him in the thing; and if he cannot have Peace
with his Brethren of the <hi>Church,</hi> upon any terms but
<hi>Full Conforming,</hi> it is God must be the Judg, and the
<hi>Bishop</hi> and <hi>Presbyterian,</hi> the <hi>Doctor</hi> and Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi>
shall know which of them it is, that are to Blame at
the Great Day. And <hi>wherefore then were ye not afraid to
speak against my servant</hi> Moses?</p>
            <p>The Doctor had no <hi>Need</hi> to lay out his Parts up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
such a Design as that he hath under his hands:
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:45622:20"/>
Nor has he <hi>Reason</hi> (I must inculcate) to <hi>Despise</hi> or
<hi>Scorn,</hi> no nor to <hi>Slight,</hi> or <hi>Neglect</hi> any body, though
the <hi>Meanest</hi> person.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>There is a late Reverend Conformist (for so I
take him to be) who in a certain Book, Entituled,</hi>
Liberty of Conscience, in its order to Universal Peace, <hi>hath
deserved better of us.</hi> I suppose <hi>(sayes he)</hi> there is a
Society, or Societies of Christians, that hold Christ the Head,
and the great points of Union; but refuse to Ioyn in such Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
or Practise, as they conceive not Allowable by the Word
of God; nor can they, that require their Compliance, pretend
on their part, that the things are Absolute Necessary to make
a Member of the Body of Christ: In this case, I say, he is
only the Schismatick that hath not a Love, that hath no Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy
with the Body; and therefore, if neither hath, they
must be both Schismaticks. <hi>I should not fill so much
room with a Quotation, but that I am taken with
the</hi> Genius <hi>of the Writer. He is a man quite Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known
to me, but he hath a fine Spirit, and his
Book savours of it: That is, so Generous, so Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did,
so Benign towards the Dissenters; as the temper
is quite contrary, in the Authors, of the</hi> Friendly Debate,
<hi>the</hi> Ecclesiastical Polity, <hi>and the</hi> Unreasonableness of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration.</p>
            <p>I am concern'd, I must needs say, that I put these
three Names together; Not that the Authors of either
of the first Books, are men of less bright Parts, or
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:45622:20"/>
that the Books have less Excellency of their kind, in
them, than the last, but because of the reason, why I
do it. For I must confess, it is a matter of real Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
to me, that a man who is so <hi>Learned</hi> a man, so
<hi>Honoured</hi> a man throughout the Nation, should prove
a <hi>Proud</hi> man, a <hi>Disdainful, Contemptuous</hi> person; Which
Temper, if it be Indulged, is so un-endurable by
God and Man, that it will hurl any one into the dust:
And I cannot do any better Service in the Earth to
this otherwise very Worthy and Excellent <hi>Doctor,</hi>
than to contribute the best I can to my utmost, for
bringing him to some Ingenuous Sense and Amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of it. And so I leave him to the World, to
judg who is most fit to be <hi>Pityed,</hi> the <hi>Doctor</hi> himself,
or Mr. <hi>Baxter. Thou shalt not Hate thy Brother in thy
Heart, but thou shalt in any wife Rebuke him, and not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
Sin upon him.</hi>
