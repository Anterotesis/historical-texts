            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Worthy <hi>Author</hi> of the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suing Discourses, was a Person of Exemplary <hi>Learning, Loyalty, Honour,</hi> and <hi>Generosity</hi>; and his <hi>Courage, Adventures,</hi> and <hi>Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings,</hi> were so eminent and remarkable in the late times of <hi>Rebellion</hi> and <hi>Anarchy,</hi> that to express them truly, and equal to his <hi>Merit,</hi> would require the <hi>Pen</hi> of a <hi>Plutarch</hi> or <hi>Sueto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi> or, at least, that of <hi>One</hi> of his more Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Friends and Admirers, whereby his hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Memory might be the more justly and pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually preserved from the consuming Rust of Time, [which by degrees devours all things] whereas it may suffer much by reason of my
<pb facs="tcp:49861:4"/>
Inability in Art, and want of Materials for such a Performance; though (I must tell you) it cannot for want of Candor and Respect.</p>
            <p>The loss of his <hi>Person</hi> I esteemed very great, as well to his <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Countrey,</hi> as <hi>Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> and not easie to be repaired. But that the <hi>Muses,</hi> or Republick of Learning might not be deprived of so great a <hi>Son</hi> of <hi>Science,</hi> without some <hi>Pillar</hi> or <hi>Monument</hi> remaining, whereby he might in after Ages be remembred; I have thought fit (for Reasons hereafter men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned) to make this Collection of the most <hi>useful</hi> of his <hi>Learned Labours,</hi> and do here transmit them to Posterity for their Advantage and Service.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Learning</hi> and <hi>Loyalty</hi> were the <hi>Twins</hi> of his Noble mind, which though they were Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues united in him, I shall here speak alittle of them separately, and as succinctly as I can.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> For his <hi>Loyalty</hi>—in our late never-to-be-forgotten <hi>Intestine Divisions</hi>; this our <hi>Author</hi> being then in the prime of his Years, and in a <hi>full Possession of a good Estate,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scended upon him from his Ancestors; but with other Loyal Persons, discontented at the then growing <hi>Rebellion,</hi> which like an <hi>Envious Cloud,</hi> began to overspread and darken the Splendor of the <hi>Monarchy;</hi> He (as I heard himself to express it) turns all his said <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance into Money;</hi> and (being a <hi>Son</hi> of <hi>Mars</hi> as well as of <hi>Hermes)</hi> as his Allegiance
<pb facs="tcp:49861:4"/>
and Honour bound him, <hi>he espouses his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties Cause and Interest, and raises a Gallant Troop of Horse therewith:</hi> And as far as he was able, opposed the Kings and Kingdoms Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, endeavouring to settle his Soveraign in his Throne, and restore Peace to his bleeding Country.</p>
            <p>But God Almighty (sure as a Punishment for our <hi>Sins,</hi> both then, and yet of too deep a <hi>Scarlet-dye,</hi> to be quickly purged, and rendred <hi>white</hi> as <hi>Wool,</hi> was pleased to permit the Rebellious Party to prevail against his (then) most <hi>Sacred Majesty,</hi> and his <hi>Arms:</hi> And this worthy Man (with many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers) became so much a Sharer in that dismal Calamity, that, after many Noble and <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Hazards of his Person in Battel,</hi> he was at the last (the Rebel-Party being too powerful) <hi>totally routed near Stow</hi> in <hi>Gloucester-shire,</hi> where the Noble and Valiant Sir <hi>Jacob Ashley</hi> was unfortunately victor'd, and taken Prisoner. In which <hi>Battel</hi> his whole <hi>Troop</hi> was cut off, and himself at the same time <hi>received several Scars of Honour,</hi> which he carried to his <hi>Grave</hi> with him.</p>
            <p>That good, but unfortunate Prince, <hi>King Charles the First,</hi> of ever Blessed Memory, (in whose Cause our Author thus engaged) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not alittle troubled, as with the unhappy Loss in General, so with this Loyal Persons Misfortunes in particular, thus sustained in his Service, was most graciously pleased in
<pb facs="tcp:49861:5"/>
some little time after, to confer upon him (in Consideration of his just and <hi>faithful Services,</hi> as well as his <hi>great Losses)</hi> an Honourable <hi>Place in his Train of Artillery,</hi> which he held during the Remainder of the Wars. <hi>He ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved his Soveraign faithfully, the King as bountifully requites his Services: Few lose by just and Loyal Services perform'd for Pious and Royal Princes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By this alone Example, methinks, the restless <hi>Plotting Non-conformist</hi> should learn to be <hi>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient,</hi> and know <hi>Allegiance</hi> to be, non only <hi>his Duty,</hi> but <hi>Advantage</hi>; since of all <hi>Grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,</hi> that which proceeds from <hi>Princes,</hi> is the <hi>Greatest, the most God-like, and obliging.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But if our <hi>Dissenters</hi> (a Title-Rebellious People pride themselves in, and love to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguished by, if they, I say) shall in stead of thus <hi>signalizing their Loyalty,</hi> make it their main work to approve themselves such a Race of <hi>true Protestant-Christians,</hi> as a late <hi>execrable Book</hi> (call'd the <hi>Life of Julian)</hi> most boldly, but <hi>falsely</hi> affirms the <hi>Primitive Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> to have been, I shall for ever cease to wonder at their constant and <hi>causeless Murmurings,</hi> or their <hi>mutinous Tenets</hi> or <hi>Actions,</hi> since their <hi>lost, or Planet-struck Passive Obedience,</hi> is always swelling them into a <hi>Malicious Hatred,</hi> and Provocation against the <hi>Government</hi>; and by degrees (if let alone) into an <hi>Active Rebellion.</hi> And this their <hi>Hypocritical Zeal,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:49861:5"/>
and <hi>pretended Piety</hi> we sadly remember, was <hi>written</hi> by them in <hi>Horrid Dismal Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters,</hi> (and at large too) in <hi>our late unnatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Wars,</hi> and testified to be <hi>true</hi> with the <hi>Blood of many Thousands,</hi> the <hi>Ruine of Multitudes</hi> of <hi>Families,</hi> the most <hi>horrid and barbarous Murder of the best of Kings,</hi> and sundry of the <hi>Nobility, Gentry,</hi> and <hi>Clergy,</hi> the sad and lamentable <hi>Banishment of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Gracious Majesty,</hi> and together with him, all the <hi>Royal Line.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These were (but some of) the Effects of the <hi>Dissenters Zeal</hi> in Anno <hi>1641.</hi> began; of which <hi>Year</hi> (to do them right) they do not delight, yea, may be <hi>ashamed</hi> to <hi>hear.</hi> The <hi>wretched Consequences</hi> therefore of such a <hi>Piety</hi> all good People have reason to <hi>dread</hi>; and also to be very watchful that they do not permit or encourage the like <hi>damnable Premisses</hi> to grow up among them For certainly, even <hi>Turks</hi> themselves are more tolerable than <hi>such Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians.</hi> But this <hi>Obitèr.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It having pleased God, in his Anger, (who a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone is the <hi>Setter</hi> up of <hi>Kings,</hi> and the <hi>Dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser</hi> of <hi>Crowns</hi> and <hi>Scepters)</hi> to suffer his <hi>late Majesty</hi> (I say) to be <hi>overcome</hi> by his own <hi>perjur'd Subjects</hi> (for they had all sworn Allegiance to him) in that most <hi>Bloody Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion</hi>; this <hi>Loyal Gentleman</hi> is thereby de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priv'd of that his <hi>Majesties</hi> said <hi>Bounty</hi> to
<pb facs="tcp:49861:6"/>
him, and (with the <hi>King</hi> himself and all the <hi>Loyal Party) put once more)</hi> to his <hi>Shifts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And what doth he now? Turn to the strongest side, like the <hi>Dog</hi> in the <hi>Apologue,</hi> who had defended his <hi>Masters Goods and Interest</hi> as long as he could, but when <hi>overcome, comply</hi> and <hi>share in the Booty</hi>? No! He had a <hi>Soul</hi> too <hi>Noble</hi> and <hi>Loyal</hi> for such base and dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous Purposes: But rather, like the great <hi>Scripture-Philosopher,</hi> would still retain his <hi>Loyalty</hi> and <hi>Integrity</hi>; and he did so to the last. For being now (as we have said) with all the <hi>Loyal Party</hi> left naked, and devested of every thing, nay, almost of his <hi>Hope</hi> too; and his <hi>Arms</hi> of no longer use to him (unless he would joyn with the <hi>Rebels,</hi> a thing he totally abhor'd!) He <hi>patiently</hi> and <hi>chearfully</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes himself to his <hi>Arts</hi>; of which he had (for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly) worthily proceeded <hi>Master</hi> at <hi>Queens Colledge, Oxon.</hi> And rather than not serve the <hi>King,</hi> his <hi>Soveraign Lord</hi> at all, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>descended to <hi>write,</hi> among other things, even <hi>Almanacks,</hi> and thereby took occasion to <hi>assert</hi> his <hi>Majesties Honour</hi> and <hi>Interest,</hi> and in that contemptible way, to make known and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large his Authority as much as in him lay to do, when he could perform it no longer by <hi>his Sword.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And for his several Loyal Endeavours by his <hi>Pen,</hi> he had soon made way for <hi>New Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles</hi> to attend him, being for that Cause looked

upon as a great <hi>Eye-sore</hi> to the <hi>Men in Power</hi> of those <hi>Tyrannous Times,</hi> and had provoked them so far (as you'l find in several Parts of these his Works) that they thought fit <hi>fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently</hi> to <hi>seize</hi> his <hi>Person,</hi> and restrain his <hi>Liberty,</hi> hoping thereby to restrain his <hi>Pen</hi>; and accordingly clap'd him up <hi>close Prisoner</hi> in the <hi>Gate-house,</hi> and <hi>Newgate</hi> sometimes, and other whiles in <hi>Windsor-Castle</hi>; in which several (to him) doleful Places, he constantly (though like a <hi>Bird in a Cage)</hi> continued sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth his <hi>Ditties of Loyalty,</hi> thereby re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring the then <hi>Ruling Rebels,</hi> that there was a <hi>Lawful King</hi> still in <hi>Being</hi> (though God had suffer'd him to partake of a large and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorous <hi>Exile)</hi> unto whom they all ought to pay their Duty &amp; Allegiance, as he himself truly did.</p>
            <p>Thus we see that even <hi>Prisons</hi> (the most <hi>hated</hi> and <hi>loathed</hi> of <hi>Places)</hi> and a Reduction to the very <hi>lowest Ebb of Fortune</hi> cannot per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mute a truly well-grounded and inbred <hi>Loyal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> nor yet the greatest Temptations of <hi>Gold and Glory</hi> in such a despised Condition, prove an <hi>Annulet</hi> of Power sufficient to warp or bend a worthy Mind from his Allegiance.</p>
            <p>In this suffering Condition he continued from the Surrender of <hi>Oxford,</hi> which was on <hi>June 24. 1646.</hi> sharing in the common Fate or Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes of all the Kings Friends, feeding upon the <hi>Garlick and Onions</hi> of the <hi>Usurpers Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny,</hi>

rather than to eat <hi>Quails</hi> at the <hi>Tables of Rebels</hi>; keeping a more than <hi>Twelve years Lent,</hi> being little better than a <hi>Hewer of Wood, and Drawer of Water,</hi> at the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of <hi>those,</hi> who (in Right and Justice) were but his <hi>Fellow Subjects</hi>: I say, in this Condition he continued until the most happy and <hi>Glorious Restauration of his present most Sacred Majesty,</hi> which was on <hi>May 29. 1660.</hi> And when the <hi>true Son of Great Britains Hopes appear'd,</hi> the <hi>Clouds</hi> that had most enviously so long <hi>benighted</hi> all <hi>Loyal, Honest Men,</hi> began to scatter apace: And then our <hi>worthy Author</hi> (among the rest) <hi>crept</hi> out of his <hi>Obscurity,</hi> and received <hi>Warmth</hi> by those <hi>powerful Solar Rays</hi> his Majesties most happy appearing had so seasonably scatter'd o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the <hi>Nation,</hi> to the acquitting of it from its many years bewilder'd Condition, and had a <hi>Re-admission into his former Place and Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice.</hi> And not only so, but in a short time af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, He received also an <hi>Additional Prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> of good Consequence; which Places of Trust, he <hi>discharged</hi> so <hi>well</hi> and so <hi>faithfully,</hi> that his <hi>Majesty</hi> thought sit, in Consideration of his <hi>former Sufferings under,</hi> and <hi>for</hi> his <hi>Royal Father,</hi> and particular Services to <hi>him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,</hi> to confer the <hi>Honour of Baronet</hi> by <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,</hi> upon <hi>him,</hi> and his <hi>Heirs</hi> for ever; which <hi>Honour</hi> his <hi>Son,</hi> Sir <hi>Polycarpus Wharton</hi> now most deservedly enjoys.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:49861:7"/>Thus this truly <hi>Loyal Person</hi> lived in the <hi>Favour</hi> of <hi>two</hi> of the <hi>Best of Kings,</hi> and was thought <hi>worthy</hi> to be <hi>rewarded by them both</hi>; and <hi>died</hi> in the <hi>Favour</hi> of his <hi>present Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty</hi> possessed of that <hi>Honour</hi> and <hi>Office</hi> the <hi>King</hi> had so freely bestowed upon him, and thought he so well deserved.</p>
            <p>This is a true, though <hi>short Description</hi> of his <hi>Loyalty,</hi> his <hi>Sufferings,</hi> and <hi>Rewards.</hi> And, I hope, some <hi>others</hi> that knew him bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and are better furnished for such an Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking, will present the World with a <hi>lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger Account</hi> of this <hi>worthy Persons Original, Life,</hi> and <hi>Actions</hi>; and thereby make amends for my Defects whatever they shall appear to be; which would be (I confess) an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Delight and Satisfaction to me, that have thus meanly endeavour'd to <hi>preserve his Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</hi> For I would have a Worthy <hi>Good Man</hi> no more forgotten, though dead, then I would have the <hi>Sun</hi> forget to shine again, after it hath left our <hi>Horizon</hi> in an Evening.

            </p>
            <p>And that you may know that this is no <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantick Story,</hi> but more than <hi>Fancy</hi> or <hi>Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,</hi> even a very real and demonstrative <hi>Truth</hi> be pleased a little to observe with me, how many <hi>several sorts</hi> of <hi>Persons</hi> and <hi>Sciences</hi> we shall find obliged by these his <hi>Learned La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours.</hi>

               <pb facs="tcp:49861:8"/>
more could not have been said in so short a room upon that Weighty, Grave, and Tremendous <hi>Subject.</hi>—Sure hereafter such mistaken <hi>Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy-men,</hi> who have <hi>drank</hi> too liberally at <hi>John Calvins Fountain,</hi> and thereby imbib'd his <hi>Poyson</hi> breath'd forth against the <hi>Stars,</hi> and the <hi>Magnifiers</hi> of <hi>God in his Works,</hi> without either serious Examination or Consideration, will cease to <hi>Calumniate Astrologers,</hi> and the laudable Science of the <hi>Stars,</hi> and be brought to confess upon their reading this <hi>Treatise,</hi> that some of them (at least) believe they have <hi>Souls</hi> as well as <hi>Bodies,</hi> and do (as the <hi>Holy Church</hi> it self) assert their <hi>Immortality,</hi> and hope for <hi>Salvation</hi> by the <hi>Blood</hi> of the <hi>blessed Jesus</hi>; abandoning all sorts of <hi>Atheism, Blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy,</hi> and <hi>Imposture.</hi>

            <p n="2">2. Should the Reader hereof be a Learned <hi>Physician,</hi> whose business it is to correct the Corporal Infirmities, which the <hi>Stars</hi> (by Gods Permission) inflict upon <hi>Mankind,</hi> he will meet in this Collection a most Learned Account of the <hi>Crises</hi> in Diseases, Illustrated by a Famous Example, and also how the <hi>Crisis</hi> it self is really made by the <hi>Motion of the Moon,</hi> and is either <hi>Safe</hi> or <hi>Dangerous,</hi> as she applies to <hi>Stars</hi> therein, either Benevolent or Hurtful, by <hi>good</hi> or <hi>bad Aspect.</hi> Nor is it a trivial, but <hi>formidable Truth,</hi> That <hi>Astrology</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth to the Knowledge both of the <hi>Theory</hi>

A Province of <hi>Study</hi> very large of it self, though here curiously contracted, yet most aptly and usefully distinguished into <hi>Causes Remote,</hi> and <hi>Propinquate</hi>; and those again subdivided, and pursu'd with such strength of <hi>Reason</hi> and <hi>Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> that he must be forced to allow the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor,</hi> not a <hi>Stranger to,</hi> but an Excellent <hi>Master in Politicks.</hi>

They being all of them <hi>Subjects</hi> so <hi>weighty</hi> and worthy in themselves, and so rationally handled by our <hi>Author,</hi> that
<pb facs="tcp:49861:10"/>
they will not only satisfie his curious Enquiry with a <hi>Demonstration</hi> of the <hi>Truths</hi> to which they pretended, but even draw out his <hi>Soul</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Admiration,</hi> when he shall find so much of <hi>Apodictical Reason</hi> urged in the defence of these <hi>Curious</hi> and <hi>Critical Subjects,</hi> for which formerly, even the <hi>greatest Clerks,</hi> and wisest of men were of Opinion, there was <hi>no Reason</hi> to be given.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Nay, let the Peruser of this <hi>Learned Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection</hi> be either <hi>Historian</hi> or <hi>Chronologer,</hi> he will not fail to find herein somewhat <hi>wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of his Pains</hi> and Reading.

            <p n="7">7. The sober and diligent <hi>Astrologer,</hi> who makes it his Business or <hi>Study</hi> to find out the <hi>occult Influences of the Stars,</hi> and how, and by what <hi>Mediums</hi> they <hi>affect the lower World,</hi> may hereby learn how the <hi>Sun, Moon,</hi> and <hi>Stars praise their Creator.</hi> The very best, and most learned among them may be taught afresh, the <hi>Reasons</hi> of their <hi>own Principles,</hi> which before they took (in many things) upon <hi>Trust.</hi> And the <hi>Ignorant</hi> and <hi>Illiterate</hi> among them may

The Truth to <hi>Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence predictive</hi> is here truly taught, and the <hi>Impostures</hi> of <hi>Knaves</hi> and <hi>Cheats</hi> are learned<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and truly discovered. The Ingenious and Intelligent <hi>Artist</hi> will easily find what part of this Book directs to the Knowledge of these Matters, without any particular <hi>Pointing.</hi>

The end whereof, was;</p>
                  <p n="1">I. Civil and Oeconomical, for the ease and refresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their Bodies, whose strength had been Exhau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted by Labour. —<hi>Sex diebus facies Opera tua, sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timo autem die quiesce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, ut quiescat bos tuus, &amp; asinus tuns, &amp; ut respiret filius ancillae tuae, &amp; peregrinus.</hi> Exod. 23.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Ecclesiastical, for the worship of God, and medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation upon his Divine works.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Spiritual (1.) As being a Type of that Spiritual Rest, whereby we should cease from the works of the World, and the Flesh, that God might work in us by his word and Spirit. And (2.) as shadowing unto us that endless rest, which all of us hope to enjoy with God in the World to come.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. The <hi>Neomeniae,</hi> or Feasts of New-Moons, Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated the First day of every Month, initiating, with the New-Moons; which was Instituted in memory of the Light Created by God; to the end.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That by this means his People might be aliena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the Superstitions and Idolatry of the <hi>Ethnicks,</hi> (who subjected the Months to the Planets, Stars, and Signs Caelestial) and know that God is the only Lord, Governour, and Moderator of the Stars, and Signs themselves, and consequently of the Months and Years, and Time in general: And therefore give unto God the

greater thanks, who ordained all these things for the use and benefit of mankind.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. To Typifie mans Renovation by the Illumination of the Holy Spirit, which is still required of all the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful: <hi>Nisi enim homo per Spiritum Dei renatus fuerit, regnum Dei videre non poterit.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">III. The Third (ordained by God) is the <hi>Pasch,</hi> or Passover, so called from the <hi>Hebrew Pasach,</hi> or (as others read it) <hi>Phase,</hi> which signifies to leap, or to passover, or beyond. This was Instituted, <hi>Anno Mundi,</hi> 2447. and celebrated from the Fifteenth day of the First Month <hi>Abib,</hi> (called afterwards <hi>Nisan</hi>) to the Twenty First day of the same, inclusively; that is, for Seven days together: Yet so, as that the First and Last there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, (<hi>viz.</hi> the Fifteenth and Twenty First) were held more Festivous, and sacred than the rest. These Seven days were likewise called the Feast of <hi>Azymes</hi>; and the First of them the <hi>Pasch,</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. For a sure testimony of the perpetual Mercy and Power he would shew to his People.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. To Typifie <hi>Christ Jesus,</hi> and our deliverance perfected by him.</p>
                  <p n="4">IV. The next Solemn Feast instituted by God, is that of <hi>Pentecost</hi>; so called from the Greek <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, but termed by the <hi>Hebrews Schesuothe,</hi> that is, the Feast of weeks, because celebrated after the Seventh week from the former Feast of the Passover, as may be seen in <hi>Exod.</hi> 34. <hi>Levit.</hi> 23. and <hi>Deut.</hi> 16.</p>
                  <p>But it truly signifies the Fiftieth Solemn and Festival day from the Second of the <hi>Azymes,</hi> in which sense St. <hi>Luke</hi> takes it, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. where he saith, <hi>Cum autem com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleretur
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:49861:19"/>
dies Pentecostes</hi>; and <hi>(Chap.</hi> 20.) Speaking of St. <hi>Paul, festinabit</hi> (saith he) <hi>ut si quomodo posset, Pentecosten ageret Hierosolymis.</hi> By this name also are meant all those Fifty days, betwixt the Second of <hi>Azymes,</hi> and the Fiftieth Festival day. And so the Author of the Vulgar Edition understood it, who ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders these words of <hi>Acts</hi> 2. in the Plural Number, <hi>viz. Cum complerentur dies Pentecostes, &amp;c.</hi> —It is also call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Festum Primitiarum,</hi> from the First-Fruits, or the Bread Offer'd, which was made of the new Fruits, <hi>Exod.</hi> 23.</p>
                  <p>This Feast was Instituted;</p>
                  <p n="1">1. In memory of the Law given by God on Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> the Fiftieth day after the <hi>Israelites</hi> departed out of <hi>Egypt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. That by the Ceremonial Oblation of two Loaves made of the New-Fruits, to the Lord, men might be admonished, they received all Fruits, and so all things else for preservation of Life, from the bountiful hands of God, and be also excited to beseech God, not only for a blessing thereupon, but also to make a sanctified use thereof.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. To Typifie that Pentecost, wherein <hi>Christ,</hi> after he had ascended, proclaimed the Law (not that which was written in Tables of Stone, but) in the Heart and mind, the Law of the New Covenant, that happy day, on which the First-Fruits of the Holy Spirit, were mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culously poured down on the Apostles.</p>
                  <p n="5">V. The Fifth, was the Feast of Trumpets, which is called by the <hi>Hebrews, Sichron The<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>uah,</hi> for that (on the First day of the Seventh Month Ecclesiastical, or first Political) the sound and noise of Trumpets or Cornets were every where heard by Commandment of God, as in <hi>Levit.</hi> 23. <hi>Mense septimo primâ die mensis, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>For the cause of this, some of the <hi>Jewish Rabbins</hi> do believe it was Ordained in memory of <hi>Isaac</hi>'s deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance from being sacrificed: and that God commanded, a noise should be then made by the Trumpet (or Horn of a <hi>Ram</hi>) for that a <hi>Ram</hi> was caught by the Horn in a Bush, and sacrificed in his stead, <hi>Gen.</hi> 22. Others think it very unlikely, that so publique and solemn a Feast, should be Instituted for the deliverance of a single Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, but rather, to commemorate those grievous Wars which the <hi>Israelites</hi> undertook, First against the <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lekites,</hi> and afterwards against the <hi>Ethnicks,</hi> and to the end they might be admonished, that this human life of ours is nothing but a perpetual Warfare upon Earth. Others otherwise conjecture, but their Fancies are too large for my Limits.</p>
                  <p n="6">VI. Next to this, in the same Month, and on the Tenth day thereof, was the <hi>Feast of Expiation</hi> cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated, as you may read it Commanded, <hi>Levit.</hi> 16. In which annual solemnity, an universal Expiatoric, or propitiatory Sacrifice was perform'd for the sins of the People: Whereby the whole passion and Fruits of our Saviours Death, were yearly shadowed out to the Life, by the whole Church.</p>
                  <p>Howbeit, the <hi>Jews</hi> say, it was Instituted in memory of Gods favour to them, in forgiving their sin of Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, committed by their making of the Calf in the desart.</p>
                  <p n="7">VII. The Feast of Tabernacles, called by the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews Chag Hasuke,</hi> and celebrated next after the two former, <hi>viz.</hi> From the Fifteenth of <hi>Thisri,</hi> to the Twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty First day inclusively, that is, for Seven days together, yet so, as that the First day was more Solemn and Festivous than the rest, as may be seen in <hi>Leviticus Chap.</hi> 23.</p>

                  <p n="9">IX. The next instituted by God, was the <hi>Septennial</hi> Sabbath, or Sabbathical year, which took beginning
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:49861:20"/>
from the Tenth day of the Seventh Month. For as the <hi>Jews</hi> every Seventh day, so their Land every Seventh year kept a Sabbath: The Observation whereof con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted in these two things especially.—</p>
                  <p>That <list>
                        <item>1. The grounds should lye untill'd.</item>

                  </p>
                  <p>And therefore <hi>Moses, Deut.</hi> 15. called this year, the year of <hi>Shemita,</hi> that is of dismission; because that both Agriculture or Tillage, and Debts, were this year Commanded by God to be forborn and remitted, <hi>Exodus</hi> 23.</p>
                  <p>The causes of this Feast, were partly Civil, partly Mystical.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. To teach them, not by continual Ex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>rcise to suck out the Earth and make it barren; for that as all other Creatures, so likewise the Earth, hath need of intermission and rest.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. To teach them Gratitude and Mercy.</p>
                  <p>Gratitude to God, for the Fruits of the Earth.</p>
                  <p>Mercy to the Poor, whereof is had a principal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard in this Law.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. To mind them of <hi>Adams</hi> first estate, wherein only the voluntary Fruits of the Earth were fed upon.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. To shadow unto them an Eternal Sabbath, that is, a Blessed life, in which all the Labours and Miseries of the present, together with the exactions of Credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors shall have an end, and the sins of Believers be remitted.</p>
                  <p n="10">X. The Tenth and last of the Feasts instituted by God, is the year of Jubile, (that is a year of Rejoycing, or of Remission,) celebrated every Fiftieth year; for so 'tis Commanded, <hi>Levit.</hi> 25. <hi>Numerabit tibi septem Hebdomadas Annorum</hi>; that is, Seven times Seven,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:49861:21"/>
which makes Forty-Nine years: Therefore the year following this, was the Fiftieth and wholly Sabbathical: whence (if you account Exclusively to another year of Jubile) you have only Forty Nine years, and so 'tis number'd in the Eighth verse of the last cited Chapter of <hi>Leviticus</hi>; but if inclusively, that is, if you account both the former and the latter, you shall have Fifty years; and so 'tis reckoned Verse 10. of the same Chapter, which manner of account is most used by us at this day. For thus a week is said to have Eight days, counting both the <hi>Sundays</hi>: But one of them excluded, there remaineth but a true week, or a Seven-night.</p>
                  <p>In this year, not only the Bondmen of <hi>Israel,</hi> were (by Gods command) set free from their Masters, and the Prison doors thrown open; but all Debts were likewise remitted: and the Grounds, Vineyards, Houses and other Possessions return'd to their first owners. For it was not permitted any man to sell his Grounds or Houses to another by a perpetual contract; but only the use and Fruits thereof till the year of Jubile: For so God Commandeth <hi>Levit.</hi> 25. <hi>Sanctificabitis Annum Quinquagesimum, &amp; vocabitis remissionem in Terra cuncta habitatoribus terrae vestrae: ipse <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>The end of which is, (as likewise was the former,) partly Civil and partly Mystical.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. For, First, God therein so ordained things, that the Families of the <hi>Israelites</hi> should not be destroyed, but more especially that Family, out of which the <hi>Messiah</hi> was to come.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. To shew unto us, what a special regard he hath of the Poor, to put them in hope of a better condition

for the Future, and also lay down a way to Brotherly Communion, so far forth as the condition of this Life will permit.</p>

                     <p>He also ordained, that the dedication of the Temple (which was made at the first in Eight days,) should be renewed and celebrated by Anniversary Holy-Days, for Eight days together, with Rejoycing and Glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, beginning from the Twentyfifth of <hi>Cisleu,</hi> 1 <hi>Mac.</hi> 4.

                     <p>The first of which is the Lords-day, or the weekly Feast of the Resurrection of Christ; not instituted by Christ, or God himself, but by the Apostles of Christ, in the room of the rejected <hi>Jewish</hi> Sabbath. To the end,—</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That Christians might not seem to be tyed and obliged to Judaism, and the Ceremonies of the <hi>Jews,</hi> or rather their superstitions, but testifie the abrogati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Mosaical Feasts, and manifest the Liberty received by Christ.</p>

That as the <hi>Jewish</hi> Sabbath did continually bring to mind the former world finished by Creation; so the Lords-day might keep us in perpetual remembrance of a far better world begun by Him, who came to restore all things, to make both Heaven and Earth new: for which cause They Honoured the Last-day, We, the First, in every Seven throughout the Year.</p>

That we can by no other Creature more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruously apprehend the Majesty of the Mighty and Supereminent Christ, than by the most Glorious Light of the Sun, the Ruler of this Day: for it is written, <hi>Et in Sole posuit Tabernaculum suum: &amp; exiit de tribu Juda, cujus signum (Leo) est Solare Animal.</hi>

                     <p>The Moveable Feasts are those, which howsoever they are celebrated on the same week-day, have yet no fixed seat in the Calendar, but in divers years, fall upon sundry days of the Month.

For, in regard some have not only not Fasted upon the <hi>Friday</hi> (and therefore <hi>Sexagesima</hi> instituted, as anon I shall tell you,) but neither also upon <hi>Saturday</hi>; because thereon our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Rested in the Grave, in token of our future Rest; (And indeed 'tis noted out of St. <hi>Augustine,</hi> that the People of <hi>Asia,</hi> and some others, grounding their practice on a certain Tradition of the Apostles, did not Fast upon the <hi>Saturday,</hi>) to supply therefore the Seven days of <hi>Sexagesima,</hi> was thereunto added this Week or Se'n-night, called <hi>Septuagesima.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. For the Signification thereof; In that by this time of <hi>Septuagesima,</hi> is denoted unto us the Exile and
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:49861:25"/>
Affliction of Mankind, from <hi>Adam</hi> to the End of the World: and therefore are all Songs of Joy intermitted by the Church, during the time of <hi>Septuagesima.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. For Representation of the Seventy years Capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity in <hi>Babylon</hi>: wherefore, as then the <hi>Israelites</hi> laid aside their Instruments, saying, <hi>Quomodo cantabimus Canticum Domini,</hi> &amp;c. So the Church, her Songs of Praise, during all this time.</p>
                     <p>As touching <hi>Sexagesima,</hi> you must know that <hi>Melchiades,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> and Martyr (who flourished <hi>Anno Christi,</hi> 311.) instituted that none should Fast upon <hi>Friday,</hi> because of the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and Ascension; as upon that day: so neither on the <hi>Sunday,</hi> which (being the First day of the week) Solemnizeth the Resurrection, thereby to put a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between the Christians and Gentiles: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, it pleased the Antients, (for Redemption of the <hi>Fridays</hi> in <hi>Quinquagesima,</hi>) to add this other week to the Fast, which they call'd <hi>Sexagesima.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now, concerning <hi>Quinquagesima</hi>: Forasmuch as the Church hath Commanded a Fast consisting of Forty days before <hi>Easter</hi> called <hi>Quadragesima,</hi> or the Holy time of <hi>Lent,</hi> wherein there is but Thirty six days, besides the Lords Days, on which she fasteth not, in regard of her Joy for his Resurrection: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to supply this defect, there were Four days of the precedent week added to the <hi>Quadragesimal</hi> Fast. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which it was (first by <hi>Telesphorus</hi> Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> and Martyr, who Flourish'd <hi>Anno Christi,</hi> 141. And since that by <hi>Gregory</hi> the Great,) Decreed, That all Priests should begin their Fasts Two days sooner, <hi>viz.</hi> Two days before the Four so added. To the end, that as they preceded the People in Dignity, so they might precede them also in Sanctity. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to the Week of <hi>Quadragesima,</hi> was this other
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:49861:25"/>
added, named <hi>Quinquagesima</hi>: Which is also called <hi>Esto mihi,</hi> from the entrance of the Ecclesiastical Caution thereon used, taken from <hi>Psalm</hi> 30.3. <hi>Esto mihi in Deum, Protectorem,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

                     <head>Of the Vigils, or Fasting Eves of Festivals.</head>
                     <p>IN the Apostles days, and some time after, when the Poor Christians durst not appear in publick, because of the continual Snares, Treacheries, and Persecution of Tyrants and Enemies of their Religion, they were forc'd to meet in the Night time, for the Exercise of their Devotion. And in the first Church after the times of the Apostles, when they stood not in Fear of any Persecution, they publickly watched and Fasted in their Churches all <hi>Easter</hi> Week long; but especially on the <hi>Eve</hi> of the Resurrection. The Vigils of this Feast (saith <hi>Eusebius, lib.</hi> 4. <hi>de vita Const.)</hi> were made as Light as day, by hanging out great Waxed Lights throughout the whole City, and Lamps, mystically expressing the light of Salvation, which was then ready to shine forth. Whence grew the Custom both for Christian Men and Women, to watch and Fast on the <hi>Eves</hi> of great Solemnities, in their Churches, and at the Sepulchres of Saints and Martyrs; whereof <hi>Flavianus</hi> and <hi>Diodorus</hi> of <hi>Antioch,</hi> are said to be the Authors.</p>
                     <p>Afterwards by the perswasion of <hi>Leontius,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Antioch,</hi> this Custom of Watching and Fasting at Sepulchres, was restrained to the Church only about the year of Christ, 375.</p>
                     <p>But, forasmuch as in process of time, these Noctur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and promiscuous Watchings, occasion'd much wickedness, therefore were the Women interdicted access thither, <hi>eò quod saepe</hi> (saith the Canon) <hi>sub Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentu orationis, scelera latenter committantur.</hi> —At length the Vigils themselves were inhibit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="32" facs="tcp:49861:33"/>
Vigils, as being the Name of a Duty therein. And this was confirm'd by <hi>Innocent</hi> the 3. about the year of Grace 1210.</p>
                     <p>For the very purpose of the Church of God (saith Judicious <hi>Hooker</hi>) both in the Number and in the Order of the Fasts, hath been not only to preserve thereby, throughout all Ages the remembrance of Miseries heretofore sustain'd, and of the causes in our selves out of which they have risen, that Men consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the one, might fear the other the more, but farther also to temper the mind, lest contrary affections coming in place should make it too profuse and disso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute; in which respect it seemeth that Fasts have been set as Ushers of Festival days, for prevention of those disorders as much as might be, wherein notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing the world always will deserve, as it hath done, Blame; because such Evil being not possible to be rooted out, the most we can do, is in keeping them low; and (which is chiefly the Fruit we look for) to create in the minds of Men, a Love towards frugal and severe Life, to undermine the Pallace of wantonness to plant Parsimony as Nature, where Riotousness hath been studyed, to harden whom pleasure would melt, and to help the Tumors which always fulness breed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that Childr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="34" facs="tcp:49861:34"/>
Our <hi>Easter</hi> then falling not till the 19 of <hi>April,</hi> which should have been the 15. of <hi>March</hi> according to the good old Rule of the Church.</p>
                     <p>Nor indeed was it any new thing, or any Errour at all of ours, that the Celebration thereof should the last year fall seven days later then it ought to do, that being the twentieth time it hath so happen'd since the year of Christ 1600, <hi>viz.</hi> In the years, 1602. 1609. 1610. 1613. 1616. 1619. 1620. 1623. 1626. 1630. 1637. 1640. 1643. 1646. 1647. 1650. 1653. 1657. 1661. and the last year, 1664. and so will again (unless the <hi>Julian</hi> Calendar, which yet we fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, be reform'd) in the years, 1667. 1669. 1673. 1677. 1681. 1684. 1685. 1687. 1688. 1691. 1694. 1697. and 31 times more before the year of Christ 1800.</p>
                     <p>Nor is this all: For there often happens a whole Months Errour as to the time of the Celebration there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, having already fallen out so three years since that of Christ 1600, <hi>viz.</hi> in the years, 1625. 1652. and 1655. and so will again (without correction of the Calendar) in the years, 1679. 1682. 1720. 1723. 1747. 1750. 1774. 1777. and in the year 1807. For in those years there will happen (from the <hi>Aequinox</hi>) two Full-Moons befo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Nay, there falls out very often no less than 35 days (or five Weeks) errour in the time of our <hi>Easter,</hi> having already fallen out so no less than ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven times since the year 1600. <hi>viz.</hi> in the years, 1603. 1606. 1614. 1617. 1622. 1633. 1636. 1641. 1644. 1660. and (as I said before) in the year, 1663. and so will again (without amendment of the Calendar) in the years, 1671. 1674. 1690. 1693. 1698. 1701. and just twenty times more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the year 1800.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="35" facs="tcp:49861:34"/>But in the years, 2437. 2446. 2491, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> there will be 42 days Errour, and sometimes afterwards no less than 49 days: And, after the year 2698. (if the old Calendar should still be continued) it will never again happen according to the Rule of the Church, which fixeth it on the <hi>Sunday</hi> following the first Full-Moon, next after the <hi>Vernal Equinox.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>One Cause of which Errours is the Precession of the <hi>Aequinoctium Vernum,</hi> which from the first <hi>Nic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

And the reason of this An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipation is, for that the <hi>Julian</hi> year exceeds the true <hi>Solar</hi> year, by 10 Minutes, 48 Seconds, or there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>about, which causes the <hi>Aequinoxes</hi> and <hi>Solstices</hi> year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to change their places, and fly backwards so many Minutes and Seconds.</p>
                     <p>The Lunations also, by reason of the too great Quantity allowed them, do in every 19 years anticipate almost an hour and an half, and in 312 years and a half, one whole day: and therefore not exactly to be found by the Golden Number, although on those Lunations the Feast of <hi>Easter</hi> dependeth, as of it all the rest of the Moveable Feasts: which is another cause of those Errours, and both together the First occasion of the <hi>Roman</hi> Emendation, whereby that Church doth always produce <hi>Easter</hi> on the <hi>Sunday</hi> following the first Full-Moon next after the <hi>Vernal Aequinox,</hi> according to the Decree of the <hi>Nicene</hi> Council.</p>
                     <p>Now here I could willingly (and indeed intended to) have demonstrated how all this might be reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died: but that multiplicity of business (which Steers my thoughts another course) and the Narrow limits
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:49861:35"/>
I am here confin'd to, do both obstruct and discourage me. All therefore I shall further say is this, I do much wonder that this <hi>Lyncaeus</hi> (whoever he was) that so vainly boasted of his discovery of that one Weeks pretended Errour in the time of <hi>Easter,</hi> and therefore traduced us all with Ignorance or Inadvertency, should himself not yet discover that real Errour of the first of those Rules prefixed to the New <hi>Common Prayer-Book</hi> Printed by <hi>John Bill,</hi> and <hi>Christopher Barker. Anno</hi> 1664. (the very year of that his great Discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry) which pretends to shew how to know when the Moveable Feasts and Holy-days begin, <hi>viz.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <q>
                           <hi>Easter-day</hi> (on which the rest depend) is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways the First <hi>Sunday</hi> after the first Full-Moon, which happens next after the One and Twentieth day of <hi>March.</hi> And if the Full-Moon happens upon a <hi>Sunday, Easter-day</hi> is the <hi>Sunday</hi> after.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>For although that Rule be true enough in respect of the <hi>Gregorian,</hi> yet it is altogether mistaken, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in no wise applicable to our <hi>Julian</hi> Account (which yet the Table of Moveable Feasts in the said <hi>Common Prayer-Book,</hi> calculated for 40 years, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardeth only, and which must be followed until his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty shall think fit to command a better,) and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore very improper for that place.</p>
                     <p>But I hope the Most Reverend Father in God, his Grace, the Lord Arch-Bishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> will make it his concern, not only to cause this Errour to be rectified, but in due time also move His Sacred Majesty to assume the Glory of a better Emendation of the Calendar, than yet the <hi>Roman</hi> Church can boast of.</p>

                     <p>IF this then be the Season of the year wherein the world had its Birth, as the most learned Divines, Chronologers, and Astronomers have unanimously con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded: It followeth next, that we consider the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution thereof.—Now to find out the temporary mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Sun's Revolution to the first scruple of <hi>Aries</hi> (where he was in the <hi>Radix</hi> of the Worlds Creation) hath been by some accounted impossible; by others a task very difficult and uncertain. And (to say the truth) such has been the wide difference herein amongst Astronomers, until of late days, that the Calculations (how nice and curious soever) made from the several Tables they published, (howbeit, every man with equal confidence and commendation of the verity and exactness of his own,) have wanted that precise concurrence which is requisite to raise thereon so compleat an Astrological Structure, as might withstand the Tempestuous Storms that fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently arise from the Turbulent Sea of Ignorance and Malice. Whereof <hi>Cardanus</hi> was so sensible, that (because he would not run the hazard of his Credit, so great in the World) he rather wholly neglected the (then so) doubtful Cusps of the Houses in these Revolutional Figures, saving thereby the labour of erecting Schems, than from such uncertainties to raise alike incertain Judgments. In which respect he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribes a regard only to the places and Aspects of the Planets. And indeed should we grant the Tables Astro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomical (what as yet we find not in them; I mean) the exactness aimed at and coveted by all men: yet, till the
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:49861:38"/>
long sought for, and hitherto unfound certainer way of attaining the true Longitude be discovered, some discrepancies (more or less) will be always occurring.</p>
                     <p>In the mean while, I could wish, that some ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Artists would apply the Directions of <hi>Daniel Sant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beck. (Probl. Astronom.</hi> and <hi>Geom. sect.</hi> 1. <hi>Prop.</hi> 10.) who by the help of a <hi>Geometrical Quadrant</hi> there described, sets down the manner of observing the true time of the <hi>Aequinoxes,</hi> whereby they may discover, not only how far the Calculations made by the Tables differ from (but also which Tables come nearest) Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation; and by this means make choice of the best, whereon to ground their Judgments Astrological.</p>
                     <p>But forasmuch as all, or the most of our Annual Prognosticks, are commonly extant before the <hi>Vernal Aequinox,</hi> on and about which day those Observati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ought to be made, it cannot be expected that we should here proceed upon those grounds, the Birth of what now we present you with, anticipating its fortune in the Press not less than Four Lunar Revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions: Wherefore all we can do here, to do fairly, will be to make choice of the best Astronomical Tables, in which Number 1 rank the <hi>Philolaick</hi> as solving the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> nearest exactness, when handled by a Skilful Artist, and reduced (not upon the bare cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit of every prostituted Catalogue of the difference of Meridians, but) with regard had to Ecliptical Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servations, determining (so near as may be) the true Longitude: otherwise great Errours may ensue, es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially in the time of <hi>Solar Ingresses, Eclipses,</hi> and other Lunations, and yet the Tables Excusable.</p>
                     <p>These things well consider'd, I cannot see with what shew of Equity we should be derided, or Astro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy exploded, in case we arrive not at such precise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in our Annual Judgments as is looked for from
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:49861:39"/>
us, by those which know not the handling of a Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, whose subject is so remote, whose paths be so variously winding and intricate.</p>
                     <p>Or, why should Astrology be contemned or slight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for want of Perfection more than all other Arts or Sciences, since really there are none without some de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect or other; nor any one that can truly say, it is free from every scrupulous exception: For (omitting <hi>Physick</hi> and the rest, which cannot justly boast of nigh so much Perfection) what <hi>Geometrician</hi> can stand up and truly tell me, he hath found out the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act <hi>Quadrature</hi> of a Circle or the Duplication of a Cube? What <hi>Algebraist</hi> can resolve the so long sought for Equation of three discontinued Numbers in <hi>Alge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briaque</hi> proportion? And should therefore those no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Sciences be rejected as vain and foolish, and the Professors be no better accounted of than Impostors; when nevertheless we cannot but confess the most Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent and daily use made of <hi>Geometry,</hi> both at Sea and Land, very well knowing that the <hi>Geometrician</hi> can Square a Circle, (though not precisely, yet) so near exactness, as leaves the issue of his indeavours without any sensible Errour? In like manner, because the Astronomer determines not precisely the true places of the Planets, (howbeit very near the same, and the Eclipses of the Luminaries, to admiration) the Astro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loger sometimes strays a little in the Species and times of the Events thereon depending; shall we therefore (altogether excusing Astronomy) lay the whole blame and weight of our Indignation on Astrology, whose <hi>Effata</hi> suppose the Planets true places, which are <hi>Scientiarum apices,</hi> the Perfection of Sciences, that God (in his Wisdom) would not have known <hi>ab initio,</hi> but reserveth only to some peculiar Men and Ages?</p>
                     <p>

                     <head>Of the <hi>Epochae</hi> or <hi>Aerae,</hi> commonly used by <hi>Chronologers</hi> and <hi>Historians,</hi> with a brief Explanation thereof.</head>
                     <p>
                        <hi>EPochae</hi> is derived from the Verb <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, which sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies to stop or stay; as if it were an Inhibition or Retention, whereby that which continually flitteth, is restrained and fixed; that so from thence the Remains may be measured.</p>
                     <p>For whereas the Coelestial bodies are Circumagita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by Motions, and that time is the Measure of Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, they must necessarily require some beginning and determinate time, from whence to be numbered, as well in <hi>Praecedentia</hi> as in <hi>Subsequentia.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As therefore (in the consideration of Coelestial Motions) there is a certain place of Heaven described by a Line, from which those Motions are Counted; so likewise (in Time) a known and famous begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, whence the Years, Months and Days, both before and after the same, are reckon'd.</p>
                     <p>This <hi>Epochae</hi> is vulgarly called the <hi>Radix,</hi> whence that which remaineth is supputated, as from a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation and Term, <hi>à quo.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It is also named the <hi>Aera,</hi> which word was Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally (but ignorantly) taken from the <hi>Spaniards</hi>
                        <pb n="47" facs="tcp:49861:40"/>
writings; afterwards much used by Astrologers, and at length translated to other writers. For, at the first, <hi>Aera,</hi> was not one word, but several, which (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing falsly and confusedly joyned) the <hi>Spaniards</hi> used but as one: and so at length it was also received by the <hi>Latins.</hi> For, whereas the sole delation of the Empire, on <hi>Augustus Caesar,</hi> became of happy conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> they therefore (in Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of him) so provided, that the great and noble Actions of their Princes and People, should be rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon'd from <hi>Augustus Caesar.</hi>— For Example, in this manner: <hi>Acta sunt haec Toleti, Calendis Martii. A. E. R. A. Caes: CCI.</hi> But in process of time (the points being omitted, by the Negligence or Ignorance of the Registers and publick Notaries) those Letters were confusedly written as one word (the first silla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble whereof was the Dipthong <hi>AE</hi>) and had a decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation assign'd it.</p>
                     <p>It is likewise by some called <hi>Hera,</hi> but very corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; for so the <hi>Spanish Dictionary</hi> of <hi>Antonius Nebrissa,</hi> wherein it is made to signifie a Monarchy. So, <hi>Hera Mundi, Hera Christi, Hera Ordinationis Julianae</hi>; and generally any other time computed from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning or rise of an Eminent and Illustrious Nation, Religion, or Sect, is called <hi>Hera.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now, forasmuch as the business and benefit of these <hi>Epochae,</hi> or <hi>Aerae,</hi> is, that the times past may there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto be compared and applied, as to a term prefixed: I have here accommodated the Reader with the most Illustrious <hi>Epochae</hi> observed at this Day, when they Commence, how they agree, and may be reduced to that of our Saviour, (the most Famous of all amongst Christians, in limiting and determining of their Affairs) for that such as be rightly instructed in the principal Intervals of years do best understand

the differences of times, which are Various, and reap far greater profit in the <hi>Histories</hi> they read.</p>

                     <p>The <hi>Epocha</hi> of <hi>Romes</hi> Foundation, agrees with the 3161. year of the <hi>Julian</hi> Period, <hi>April</hi> 21.

and besides the 10. days substracted as aforesaid, in the year 1700. by Omitting the Leap-day, the <hi>Gregorian</hi> year shall be 11 days shorter than our <hi>Julian</hi> year; and so in the year 1800. it shall be 12. days shorter: and lastly, in <hi>Anno</hi> 1900. it shall be 13. days shorter; but in the year 2000. by keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and intercalating the Leap-day, it shall still be but 13 days shorter, and so forward.</p>

Christs <hi>Aera,</hi> and so Substraction cannot be made, as before; let the given years of the <hi>Epocha</hi> be substracted from the Interval, and the residue will declare the Current years thereof before Christ.</p>
                     <p>Moreover, if the given years be deduced from an <hi>Aera</hi> succeeding that of Christ, then add the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val of this <hi>Epocha</hi> from the <hi>Radix</hi> of Christ to the years proposed, and the <hi>Aggregate</hi> gives the number of years from the Birth of our Saviour, agreeable to the given years of the <hi>Epocha</hi> proposed. As for Example:</p>
                     <p>I desire to know in what year of Christ the <hi>Arabian Aera</hi> commenceth, which <hi>Arzachel</hi> the Astronomer referreth to the 932. year of <hi>Dhilkarnain.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now, because the <hi>Aera</hi> of <hi>Dhilkarnain</hi> beginneth <hi>Anno</hi> 311. <hi>ante Christum,</hi> I substract 311 years from 933, and the remainder 622 shews the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent year after Christ, in which the <hi>Arabian Aera</hi> Commenceth.</p>
                     <p>Again, I would know how many years the 452. year of the City, is before Christ.</p>
                     <p>Here (because the <hi>Aera</hi> of the City falls out 753 years before Christ, which cannot be substracted from the proposed year, being greater than it) I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct 452, from 753, and the remainder 301 is the number of years that the 452. of the City precedes our Saviours <hi>Aera.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Lastly, I demand what year of Christ corresponds to the 1373. year of <hi>Dioclesian.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Dioclesian Aera</hi> (as already I have told you) began <hi>Anno Christi</hi> 284. Now, by adding 284, (the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terval of this <hi>Aera</hi> from Christ) to 1373, (the year proposed) I find that the <hi>Aggregate</hi> 1657. is the number of years from the birth of our Saviour, agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the 1373. year of <hi>Dioclesian.</hi>

                     <p>TO reduce the <hi>Olympiads</hi> proposed to the year of our Saviour: First, Substract an Unite from the number of <hi>Olympiads</hi> given, and then Multiply the remainder by 4. To the Product, add the current year of the <hi>Tetraeterid</hi> proposed, and the Sum is the elapsed years from the first <hi>Olympiad.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now if this Sum exceed 776. (for so many years their <hi>Radix</hi> preceded that of Christ's) deduct 776, from thence, and the residue shews the Current year of Christ: But if it be less, Substract the same from 776, and what remains gives you the year before Christ.—For Example:</p>
                     <p>I would know what year of Christ agrees to the first year of the 609. <hi>Olympiad</hi>:— First I Substract 1, from 609, and there rests 608. Then I Multiply 608, by 4, and the Product is, 2432, unto which I add 1, (for the year of the current <hi>Tetraeterid)</hi> and the Sum is, 2433.</p>
                     <p>Lastly, I Substract 776, from 2433, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder 1657, agreeth to the proposed first year of the 609. <hi>Olympiad.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Once more, I would know what year of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our corresponds to the 3. year of the 93. <hi>Olympiad,</hi> in which the Moon (according to <hi>Zenophon</hi>) is said to have been Eclipsed?</p>
                     <p>First, I Substract 1, from 93, and (the remainder) 92. being Multiplied by 4. produceth 368 years. To which I add 3, the current years of the given <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traeterid,</hi> and they make 371, which being deduct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from (because they are less than) 776, there remaineth 405, which is the year of Christ, agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the proposed 3. year of the 93. <hi>Olympiad.</hi>

                     <p>SEek in it the number of years from <hi>Nabonnassar,</hi> which you desire to turn into <hi>Julian</hi>: Or (when you find them not precisely) the next greater. From which Number so found, deduct the proposed years, and the remainder added too (if the time proposed be before Christ,) or, if after, Substracted from the year of Christ, (which stands on the right hand the Table over against the Number of <hi>Egyptian</hi> years) leaves the year to be reckon'd before or after Christ, as the Title directeth.</p>
                     <p>This done, take (in the same part of the Table) the day of the <hi>Julian</hi> year agreeable to the first of the Month <hi>Toth,</hi> and then divide the remainder of years (after the first Substraction) by 4, For, if the <hi>Quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> (which must ever be augmented by 1, when ought remaineth after Division, otherwise not at all) be added to that day of the <hi>Julian</hi> year, you have the Seat of the first <hi>Egyptian</hi> Month <hi>Toth,</hi> in the <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> Calendar. And (the head of the year being found) 'tis quickly seen how the days of the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Months agree.</p>
                     <p>For, take but (in the Canon of <hi>Egyptian</hi> Months) the Elapsed days from the head of the year to the day proposed, and add the Sum to the day of the Month in the <hi>Julian</hi> year (unto which you have found that the first of <hi>Toth</hi> agreeth) and you have the day of the Month in the <hi>Julian</hi> year, according to the <hi>Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian</hi> proposed.</p>
                     <p>But if the years proposed be from <hi>Alexander</hi> and following the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Ordination; then (because there are just 424. years betwixt the <hi>Aera</hi> of this King's, and that of <hi>Nabonnassar</hi>) add but 424 years to the
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:49861:48"/>
given years from <hi>Alexander</hi> and with the Sum, as you did with that of the years of <hi>Nabonnassar,</hi> find out the corresponding of the <hi>Julian</hi> year: for it will be the same with that which would be found with the years from <hi>Alexander.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Lastly, the day of the <hi>Julian</hi> year thus gotten, you cannot be ignorant of the <hi>Gregorian</hi>; for, by adding but to the <hi>Julian,</hi> the difference of days betwixt them for the Century proposed, you have the day in the <hi>Gregorian.</hi> As for Example—</p>

                        <hi>Theon</hi> (in his Commentaries upon the Six Books of <hi>Ptolemies Syntax</hi>) maketh mention of a Solar Eclipse observed by him at <hi>Alexandria,</hi> in the 1112. year of <hi>Nabonnassar,</hi> the 22. day of the Month <hi>Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni,</hi> I desire to know what day of the <hi>Julian</hi> year agrees thereunto.</p>
                     <p>The next greater Number of years from <hi>Nabon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nassar</hi> (for I find not the year proposed exactly) are, by the Table beforegoing, 1204. and the years of Christ answerable, on the right hand, 456 after Christ, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with <hi>May</hi> 1.</p>
                     <p>Therefore I Substract 1112, from 1204, and there remaineth 92 years, which 92 deducted from the found years after Christ, leaveth 364 for the current years after our Saviour.</p>
                     <p>This done, I divide the first remainder 92, by 4, and the <hi>Quotient</hi> is 23, and nothing remaining; which added to <hi>May</hi> 1. gives <hi>May</hi> 24. for the day unto which the first of <hi>Toth</hi> agreeth.</p>
                     <p>Now, seeing that from the Series of the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Months, 210 days are compleatly elapsed with the Month <hi>Pachon,</hi> and that the proposed day is the 22. Current of the following <hi>Payni,</hi> together making 292, I add 292, to <hi>May</hi> 24. (unto which the first of <hi>Toth</hi> answereth,) and it produceth <hi>March</hi> 13. Therefore
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:49861:48"/>
the year of Christ, 365. <hi>March</hi> 13. <hi>post Christum,</hi> in the <hi>Julian</hi> year agreeth to the proposed time from <hi>Nabonnassar.</hi>

                     <p>But, if the remainder exceed 365 days, you must therewith re-enter the Table, and thence take the next lesser number of Days (as you did before) to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the Opposite years on the left hand; which add to the former; so continue your Work, until there remain fewer Days than 365. that you may collect the <hi>Julian</hi> years as aforesaid.— For Example.</p>
                     <p>I desire to know what day of the <hi>Julian</hi> year agrees to the l057. from <hi>Hegira,</hi> the 7. day of the Month <hi>Saphar.</hi>

                     <p>A <hi>Year</hi> is the principal and most ordinary part of time, whereby not only the Ages of Men, the World, and of other things, but also the Times of

almost all Actions in the World, <hi>viz.</hi> their Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, Progress, Durations, and Intervals, are mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured and numbered.</p>
                     <p>It is a Periodical Revolution, or a Great Circle of Months and Days, in which the four Seasons, <hi>Spring, Summer, Autumn,</hi> and <hi>Winter,</hi> are, after one Revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of the Sun, ordained to return in their courses.</p>
                     <p>It is called <hi>Annus,</hi> from <hi>Annulus,</hi> a Ring; for that a Motion in a Ring finished, beginneth again with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out end: wherefore <hi>Virgil</hi>;

                     <p>But because the spaces of time called years, are divers with divers Nations, greater in some, and lesser in others, and for good reasons reduced to the rule of the Celestial motions, by which the years are measured, therefore are they rightly divided into <hi>Astronomical</hi> and <hi>Political.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Astronomical</hi> years are measured, either accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Periodical motion of the Sun, or the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction of the Moon with the Sun, and therefore two-fold; <hi>Solar</hi> and <hi>Lunar.</hi>

                     <p>The <hi>Solar</hi> year is that space of time, in which the Sun by his proper motion departing from any one point of the <hi>Ecliptick,</hi> returns to the same again; and this is either <hi>Natural,</hi> or <hi>Sydereal.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Natural</hi> year is the space of time, in which the Sun (departing from one of the <hi>Tropical, Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noctial,</hi> or <hi>Solsticial</hi> points, and running through the
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:49861:52"/>
whole <hi>Ecliptick</hi>) runneth to the same point again.</p>
                     <p>It is called <hi>Natural,</hi> because it seems to be destinat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Nature, for the mensuration of time: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of the Suns double motion, in respect of us; it is also two-fold, <hi>Mean</hi> and <hi>True.</hi>

                     <p>The <hi>Mean</hi> motion is ascribed to the <hi>Mean Equinox</hi> and Solstice, and containeth 365 d. 5 h. and 49′. 15″. 45‴. 52<g ref="char:qprime">''''</g>. 48<hi rend="sup">v</hi>′ and this is the Rule and Level of all years.</p>

                     <p>The <hi>Sydereal</hi> year is the space of time, in which the Sun returns to the same Star (be it <hi>Fixed</hi> or <hi>Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratical</hi>) from whence he departed, wherefore this also is either <hi>Fixed</hi> or <hi>Moveable.</hi>

Months by little and little anticipated; they (I say) by Authority of the <hi>Persian Emperour, Alb.

                     <p n="2">2. The <hi>Romans,</hi> who use a greater year than the <hi>Egyptians</hi> and ancient <hi>Persians.</hi> For, according to <hi>Julius Caesar</hi>'s constitution, their year consists of 365 d. 6 h. which 6 hours do make every 4<hi>th.</hi> an <hi>Intercalar,</hi> containing 366. days, whereas the <hi>Commune</hi> consists but of 365. And this year is not only used by the <hi>Muscovites,</hi> who (retaining the Names and Quantities of the <hi>Roman Months</hi>) begin their year the <hi>First</hi> of <hi>September</hi>: and likewise by the <hi>Syrians,</hi> or <hi>Syro-Graecians,</hi> who number their Months and Days ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the <hi>Julian</hi> manner, although they give them other names, as hereafter shall be shewed; but also by the <hi>Habassines,</hi> the <hi>Cophti,</hi> and <hi>Ethiopians.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But according to the <hi>Emendation</hi> made by <hi>Pope Gregory</hi> the 13<hi>th.</hi> the year consists of 365 d. 5 h. 49′. 12″. and so not quite 4″. less than the <hi>Mean Solar</hi> year: For, because (according to that Account) there are in every 400 <hi>Julian</hi> years (consisting of 146100 days, three Intercalar days omitted, it is evident that 400 <hi>Gregorian</hi> years contain but 146097 days, which (if divided by 400) quoteth the aforesaid number of days, hours, and scruples of a year.</p>
                     <p>Now, that the reasons of this <hi>Emendation,</hi> and so the <hi>Julian</hi> and <hi>Gregorian</hi> years themselv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>s may the better be understood: we must know that in the <hi>Julian</hi> year, the odd 6 hours are not reckoned every year,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:49861:54"/>
but once every fourth year, being then increased to the just length of a Natural day, which is always put at the 25. of <hi>February,</hi> so that the Letter <hi>F.</hi> (as this present <hi>Bissextile</hi> 1660.) is twice repeated, and St. <hi>Matthias</hi> day observed upon the latter, according to the Verse,
<q>
                           <l>Bissextum sextae Martis tenuere Calendae,</l>
                           <l>Posteriore die celebrantur festa Mathiae.</l>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>So then the <hi>Julian</hi> year is two-fold, <hi>viz. Commune</hi> (consisting of 365 days) and <hi>Bissextile</hi> (of 366 days.) It is called <hi>Bissextile</hi> of <hi>Bis</hi> and <hi>Sex,</hi> twice six, because the sixth <hi>Calends</hi> of <hi>March</hi> is twice repeated; Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calar, because of the day that is put between; and <hi>Leap-year,</hi> for that by this Addition of the day, from thenceforth the <hi>Fixed Holy-days,</hi> and the like, do as it were leap one day farther into the Week, than they were the former year.</p>
                     <p>But this <hi>Julian Account</hi> is very erroneous. For though the mean Tropical year consisting (according to the <hi>Alphonsin's</hi>) of 365 d. 5 h. 49′. 16″. it is plain that the <hi>Julian</hi> year exceeds it 10′. 44″. thereby cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing an apparent anticipation of the <hi>Equinoctial</hi> and <hi>Solsticial</hi> points, insomuch that the <hi>Vernum Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noctium</hi> (whose place at the first <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Nice</hi> was the 21. of <hi>March</hi>) is now come to be upon the 9<hi>th.</hi> or 10<hi>th.</hi> the Emendation of which Errour, Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> the 13. hath very well performed, by sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracting 10 days from the 4<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>October</hi> unto the 15<hi>th.</hi> of the same Month exclusively, <hi>Anno</hi> 1582. that thereby he might make the <hi>Equinoctium vernum</hi> (whereon the <hi>Moveable Feasts</hi> depend) agree to the 21. of <hi>March,</hi> as it was by the <hi>Nicene Council</hi> esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished <hi>Anno</hi> 324. By means whereof all their Months

begin ten days sooner than ours, (their 11. day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the first of the <hi>English,</hi> and our last of every Month the 10. of theirs.) And to retain the same <hi>Equinoctium vernum</hi> for future times invariably upon the same day, he appointed that of 400 d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>And this is the Account received in all Countries professing subjection to the See of <hi>Rome:</hi> but we (wiser than all the World besides) do still retain the old <hi>Julian</hi> Account, so erroneous (as I said before) that in process of time (if no correction be made) our <hi>Saviour</hi> and St. <hi>John</hi> must exchange their Tropicks, <hi>i. e.</hi> The <hi>Feast of Christs Nativity</hi> will fall in <hi>June,</hi> when now the Sun enters <hi>Cancer,</hi> and that of the Baptists in <hi>December,</hi> when now the Sun enters <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pricorn.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And the main reason objected against an Emendation here, is, the Confusion would follow about the Dates of our Civil Contracts, Deeds, Bonds, Bills, Payment of Rents, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But (to say no more) if all <hi>Bissex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles</hi> were omitted but 52. years, that alone would gradually and insensibly, without the least inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, bring us two days before the <hi>Gregorian,</hi> and be agreeable to the Sun's place at our Saviours Birth; whereas the <hi>Roman</hi> (being reduced only to the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Nice</hi>) would be two days less exact. And if after that the <hi>Bissextiles</hi> be kept as before (except in every 132. year, wherein a Leap-day must be exempted for ever) or else, that one Leap-day be struck off every 100 year (except in each 400) for ever, there would need no more to have our

                        <hi>Christian Festivals</hi> kept according to <hi>Primitive Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation.</hi> For, by supposing the Tropical year to be (after <hi>Bullialdus,</hi> 365 d. 5 h. 49′. 4″. 21‴. the Annual redundancy allowed it by <hi>Caesar</hi> will be 10′. 55″. 39‴. which compleateth one day in 132 years, and but 2′. 25″. 48‴. over, and three days in 400 years, with 51′. over, which make but one day in 11294 years very inconsiderable.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Arabians , Indians,</hi> and <hi>Turks,</hi> account by the Moon, who make up their year of twelve Syno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dical Lunations, and in thirty years, wherein their Period is compleated, they account 19. years of 354 days, and 11, <hi>viz.</hi> the 2.5.8.10.13.16.19.21.24.27. and 30<hi>th</hi> of 355. days; so that by this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count the whole Period consisteth of 10631. days. And therefore one <hi>Lunation</hi> (whereof there are 360. in the whole 30. years Period) containeth 29 d. 12 h. 44′.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Romans</hi> also in times past, had respect to the Moon, in their description of the year according to <hi>Numa Pompilius</hi> his Ordination, as <hi>Macrob.</hi> testifies <hi>Lib.</hi> 1 <hi>Saturn. cap.</hi> 13.</p>
                     <p>But they that regarded both the Luminaries were,</p>

                     <p n="3">3. The <hi>Jews</hi> of these days: who about the time of <hi>Constantine</hi> the Great, framed a peculiar Calendar by the Industry of <hi>Rabbi Hillel</hi>; wherein they brought the Moons Motion (which defineth the Feasts) to agree precisely enough with the Sun's: so that the <hi>Equinoxes</hi> and <hi>Solstices</hi> could not easily be removed from their places.</p>

                     <p>The Months by which we measure the year, (so called <hi>à metiendo vel mensurando</hi>) are two-fold, <hi>Astro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomical</hi> and <hi>Political.</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Mean</hi> (or <hi>Equal</hi>) being the rule of all <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar</hi> Months, is the space of time, wherein the Sun by his Mean motion dispatcheth a twelfth part of the <hi>Zodiack</hi>; and it is always 30d. 10h. 29′. 6″. 18‴. 50<g ref="char:qprime">''''</g>.</p>
                     <p>But the <hi>True</hi> (or <hi>apparent</hi>) is the space of time, in which the Sun by his True Motion runs through one Sign of the <hi>Zodiack</hi>: and seeing this Motion is unequal, it also constitutes unequal Months, longer about his <hi>Apogaeum</hi> in <hi>Cancer,</hi> where his Motion is slowest and shorter about his <hi>Perigaeum</hi> in <hi>Capricorn,</hi> where his Motion is swiftest.</p>

                     <p>The <hi>Periodical</hi> is the space of time, in which the Moon by her motion returneth to the same place of the <hi>Zodiack</hi> from whence she departed: which (accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to her Mean motion) is performed in 27 d. 7 h. 43′. 5″. <hi>fere</hi>: but according to the true, one hour at the most, more or less.</p>

                     <p>The <hi>Synodical</hi> Mean Month, in which the Lumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries do meet together by mean or equal motions, and which is the Rule and Measure of all <hi>Lunar</hi> Months is 29 d. 12 h. 44′. 3″. 10‴. 58<g ref="char:qprime">''''</g>. 10<hi rend="sup">v</hi>.

                     <p>The Month of <hi>Illumination</hi> (or <hi>Apparition</hi>) is the space of time intercepted betwixt the first day whereon the Moon is seen after her Conjunction with the Sun, and the last day of her being visible, which the vulgar take to be 28 days: nevertheless this is not always so; for sometime she is seen sooner, and sometime later, and accordingly vanisheth: (1.) as her <hi>Latitude</hi> is <hi>Northward</hi> or <hi>Southward:</hi> (2.) or her <hi>Motion swifter</hi> or <hi>slower:</hi> (3.) or in <hi>Signs Ascending</hi> and <hi>Descending, Right</hi> or <hi>Oblique.</hi>

                     <p>Wherein although <hi>Jan.</hi> and <hi>Feb.</hi> were put before <hi>March,</hi> and so <hi>March</hi> not made the First but the Third month: yet nevertheless <hi>Quintilis</hi> (now not the 5th. but the 7th.) retained still the name <hi>Quinti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis,</hi> as did also the other following months in their order.</p>
                     <p>But when <hi>Numa</hi> observed that by this quantity of the year (which is <hi>Lunar,</hi> and conformable to the Graecian year) the Sun returned not to the same point of Heaven; he reduced and accommodated this Lunar year to the Suns Motion, by an Intercalation of a New Month consisting of 22 or 23 days, which after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the <hi>Romans</hi> called either <hi>February-Intercalar,</hi> or <hi>Mercedonian,</hi> and which once in two years, they intercalated by turns, lest <hi>March</hi> should be removed from the beginning of the Spring, or that more years should be accounted from the building of <hi>Rome,</hi> than justly the true quantity of the year would allow of.</p>
                     <p>But although this kind of <hi>Intercalation,</hi> so restored the <hi>Numan</hi> year, which without it was meerly Lunar to the Suns course, that the Equinoxes and Solstices were in a manner fixed to the same months: yet when afterward they observed it somewhat exceeding the <hi>true</hi> and <hi>natural</hi> Quantity of the year, and that the Arch-Priest (whose business it was to correct the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercalation</hi>)
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:49861:59"/>
had often-times intermitted it, and either out of Malice and Favour (whereby any man might be rid of, or longer continued in his Magistery, or the Renter of the Tribute, or Customs, or other pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick things, either gain or lose by the Magnitude of the year) several ways depraved it: it fell out that <hi>Anno V. C.</hi> 708. (after the <hi>Numan</hi> year had been in use 670. compleat years) the Correction made by <hi>Julius Caesar</hi> was received.</p>
                     <p>For, <hi>Julius Caesar</hi> (the first Monarch of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi>) having learned the <hi>Mathematicks</hi> at <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria,</hi> observed, that yet there was almost 10 days and 6 hours wanting in the <hi>Numan</hi> year, to the full compleating of the Solar year, and by the advice of <hi>Sosigenes</hi> the <hi>Mathematician,</hi> whom after his over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw of <hi>Pompey,</hi> he brought with him out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> to <hi>Rome</hi>: he added those ten days, whereof to <hi>January, Sextilis,</hi> and <hi>Decemb.</hi> two days, but to <hi>Apr. June, Sept.</hi> and <hi>Novemb.</hi> each of them one: whence <hi>Jan. Mar. May. Quint. Sext. Oct.</hi> and <hi>Dec.</hi> had 31 days, and the rest (<hi>Febr.</hi> excepted, which had but still 28) 30 days, as you may read in <hi>Macr. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>Saturn. cap.</hi> 14.</p>
                     <p>Therefore presently in the first year of the <hi>Julian</hi> Ordination, not only <hi>Quintilis</hi> (which was afterward cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>July,</hi> in honour of <hi>Julius Caesar</hi> the Dictator) had 31 days assigned it, but also the month <hi>Sextilis,</hi> which was likewise called <hi>August</hi> in honour of <hi>Augustus.</hi> The words of the Senate you may see in <hi>Macrob. citato loco.</hi> And hence came it that the Civil <hi>Roman</hi> months were numbered as at this day, according to the Verses.

                        <hi>KEpler</hi> (the <hi>Lyncaeus</hi> of the last Age) defines an Aspect in this manner: <hi>Aspectus est Angulus à Radiis Luminosis binorum Planetarum in terra forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus, efficax ad stimulandum naturam sublunarem.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It is (saith he) an Angle made in the Earth by the Luminous Beams of two Planets, of strength to stir up the vertue of all sublunary things.</p>
                     <p>The ancient Astrologers took notice but of five that were effectual, namely, the Conjunction, Opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Quartile, Trine, and Sextile: The first whereof, although it be not properly an Aspect, yet if the word Aspect be to be taken in a larger sense, the Conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons may be so term'd, for that in it the Planets have their vertues United: And as Sound is the Basis of Harmonical Proportion, and an Unit the beginning
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:49861:62"/>
of Number; so is the Conjunction the ground of the other Aspects.</p>
                     <p>But although the Ancients number'd no more that were effectual, yet surely all Aspects are so (more or less) which being multiplied in themselves beget others that are greater, even till they finish the whole Circle, and they are very many, indeed innumer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, because there are infinite Regular Figures to be expressed, or at least imagined, by the continual du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication made of their sides, whose efficacy or force emitted from above, some attribute to Pythagorical Numbers, (and therefore as many ways as an Aspect is found to be effectual, so many Numbers of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercepted Degrees are observed:) Others say, and believe, it depends only upon the Nature of the Signs; (and so every Configuration of an Opposite sign produces alteration:) And this is clear'd in the Crises of Diseases</p>
                     <p>Hence the Learned <hi>Kepler</hi> (after many praevious Meteorological observations) added more Aspects to the Old, whose formal cause is drawn from 7 Figures describ'd in a Circle, <hi>viz.</hi> a <hi>Triangle,</hi> a <hi>Quadrangle,</hi> a <hi>Pentagon,</hi> a <hi>Hexagon,</hi> an <hi>Octogon,</hi> a <hi>Decagon,</hi> and a <hi>Dodecagon</hi>; from whence arise these Aspects in Order.</p>

                     <p>Now, as touching their Aequation there hath been, and yet is some difference depending amongst Astrolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers: For a sort of Pretenders (very strangers to Mathematical Demonstrations) do wilfully neglect the latitude of the Planets in Direction: And all their Reason is, because (as they think) <hi>Ptolemy,</hi> 3. <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dripart.</hi> does the like; which smells too rank of Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance: for if they rightly understood <hi>Ptolemy,</hi> they might plainly perceive his Examples there do suppose the Promissors and Significators within the <hi>Ecliptique,</hi> and therefore no Latitude to be consider'd; whereas Doubtless, if he had directed any of the Planets hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Latitude, he would have regarded their Latitude, very necessary to be known, as himself acknowledges, <hi>Cap. de Applicationibus, De bis, qui non nutriuntur in Figurâ aequicruria,</hi> and elsewhere. But these men are laught at.</p>
                     <p>The truth is, <hi>Ptolemy</hi> made question only whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or no it ought to be observed in the <hi>Sextil,</hi> and <hi>Trine</hi> Aspect; And if he had exploded it (which is not to be credited in so great and famous an Artist) 'twas possible <hi>Ptolemy,</hi> (being but a Man) might therein have err'd as well as in other things. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, such as say they follow him, do utterly reject it, affirming, that these Radiations are not to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider'd as they proceed from one Point of the Heavens to another, but according as they concur in the Center of the Earth, where they do <hi>Angulum Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituere</hi>: which (say they) is always the same, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever Point or place they proceed from, with La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, or without.</p>

respect of Longitude and Latitude, in which Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber is <hi>Leovitius,</hi> and <hi>Johannes Blanchinus,</hi> the latter of which prying (as he thought) deeper into the matter, and making great account of a little space of time, (Neglected by <hi>Ptolemy</hi>) in taking these Aspects; assumes their Aequation for a great Circle passing by the Center of a Star having Latitude; and enclin'd beyond the Aequator; Proving that the <hi>Quartile</hi> Aspect ever falls within the <hi>Ecliptique,</hi> and is to be accounted without Latitude: that the Opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion always retains the same Latitude, which the Body of the Star doth, though of Contrary Denomination; the <g ref="char:trine">△</g> and ⚹ half the Latitude (the ⚹ of the same, the <g ref="char:trine">△</g> of a contrary Denomination) and shews that these Radiations cannot possibly make an Angle in the Center of the Earth, unless they first truly behold one another in the Heavens; whose configuration admits of variation in respect of Latitude. And to this Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion <hi>Argol</hi> freely subscribes, rejecting the Aequations of <hi>Regiomontanus</hi> and all others, as void of Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration, averring this most agreeable to observation, having had (as he saith) experience thereof in more than a 1000 Genitures.</p>
                     <p>But <hi>Oranigus</hi> (as great an Astrologer and Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matician as any of the other) although he denies not but that the Square and Opposite Aspects do always retain the same Point of the <hi>Zodiack,</hi> wherein they are made, and require no alteration thereof; so that the Latitude is not to be Changed, in the <hi>Quartiles</hi> (be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cause they always terminate in the <hi>Ecliptique</hi>) howso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it be in the Oppositions that (they terminating on the Contrary part) the Latitude admits of contrary Denomination; which the Diametrical Line passing by the Center and cutting the Plane of the <hi>Ecliptique</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrates: yet (neglecting any Aequation of the Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:49861:64"/>
which indeed never ought to be regarded in the Aspects, as sufficiently appears by the Doctrine of Triangles, and the Dimension of the sides of these Aspects in the Globe) he Aequates them only in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of Longitude, which (in my Opinion) is a way the most exact and Rational of all others, and approved of by the most and best of Modern Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticians, provided we consider them (as they do) in respect of the <hi>Ecliptique,</hi> not of the <hi>Aequator.</hi> How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit, it will merit the Pains if in Directions we ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve both, (<hi>viz.</hi> that of <hi>Blanchinus,</hi> and this of <hi>Origanus</hi>) and by comparing severally the just time of every Accident; we shall quickly Discover, which of the two may best Challenge our Observance.</p>

                     <head>Of the Aequation of time, in respect of the Inequality of Natural Days.</head>
                     <p>THe Natural Days are two ways considered, Aequal and Inequal.</p>
                     <p>The Aequal are the mean days, consisting of one whole Revolution of the Aequator, and an additament of so much time, as is answerable to 59′. 8″. 19‴ 45<g ref="char:qprime">''''</g>. (the mean motion of the Sun in one Day.)</p>
                     <p>The Inequal are the true or apparent days, which consist of so much time as the Revolution of the Aequator is made in, with an additament of so much time as agrees to the true motion of the Sun in one Day.</p>
                     <p>The Inequality therefore of these Days arises from this Inequal additament, and that for two causes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spectively.</p>
                     <p n="1">
                        <pb n="101" facs="tcp:49861:67"/>1. The first of which is the Inequal Motion of the Sun in the <hi>Ecliptique,</hi> for the Sun being moved in an Eccentrical <hi>Orb,</hi> it so happens, that in equal spaces of time, he describes inequal Arches of the <hi>Ecliptique:</hi> and therefore it must needs follow that the Ascentions of the Aequator, or additaments agreeing thereunto are also inequal: And this Experience it self tells us; for the Sun runs through one half of the <hi>Zodiack, viz.</hi> the six Northern Signs, ♈. ☿. ♊. ♋. ♌. ♍. not in less time than 186 days, and about 6 hours: but the other half, <hi>viz.</hi> the six Southern Signs, ♎. ♍. ♐. vs. ♒. ♓. in 178 days, and almost 22 hours.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The second is the Obliquity of the <hi>Zodiack,</hi> which causes an Inequality or difference (as well in a right, as Oblique Sphere) betwixt the Right Ascentions of the Aequator and Zodiack.</p>
                     <p>Whence it appears, that the difference betwixt an apparent, and a mean or Aequal day, is called the Aequation of Days; for that by this Aequation, the Natural mean days, are converted into the true or apparent.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore seeing that Inequal days cannot be the measure of equal motions, it is requisite that those Inequal days be converted to equal, (so oft as we intend to supputate the Equal motions by the <hi>Ephemeris)</hi> but contrary wise when we would reduce the Equal or mean Days to apparent or Inequal.</p>

                        </gap>, the Doctrine of Eclipses takes precedence, because that from their observations, the Primary Foundations of the whole body of Astronomy are Confirm'd, Evinc'd, and Demonstrated.</p>
                     <p>For seeing that the Sun is Eclipsed only in his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction with the Moon, and the Moon in her Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition to the Sun, we conclude the cause of the Sun's Eclipse to be the Interposition of the Moon betwixt him and the Earth, and the cause of the Moons Eclipse, the Interposition of the Earth betwixt her Body and the Sun's.</p>
                     <p>Thus the <hi>Solar Eclipses</hi> do manifest the Moon to be Lower and less than the Sun: The <hi>Lunar,</hi> Evince the <hi>Earth</hi> not founded infinitly below us (as <hi>Xeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phon Colophonius</hi> trifled) But that the Heavens (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der us) are distant from the Earth as far upwards, (in respect of those that be our Antipodes) as here they are: and consequently, that the Earth is not Cubical, nor Pyramidal, Scaphoidal, or otherwise Hollow, Nor Tympanoidal, nor Cylindroidal,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:49861:68"/>
but on every side perfectly Round, or terminated by a Globosous Figure: Because that not only the Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of the Earth (in the Moon's Body) is always, and on every part observed to be round: but also for that such as live Eastward do number more hours from their Meridian, for the beginning or ending of an Eclepse than such as live Westward, proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onally to their distance.</p>
                     <p>By Eclipses also of the Moon, we know that the Earth is moved (or Placed) in the middle of the Zodiaque, because that she is Eclipsed only in the Opposite Places thereof.</p>
                     <p>The Oriental or Occidental Eclipses of the Moon tell us, one half of the World is always visible, and that daily one half of the Zodiaque Rises above the Horison.</p>
                     <p>The Lunar Eclipses best discover to us the Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitudes of Places upon the Earth: and assure us the Earth and Water make but one Globe.</p>
                     <p>That the Mountains of the Earth are not to be compared to the bigness thereof, the equal roundness of the Shadow tells us: Wherein we observe no Hiulcity or Cleft, by reason of the Vallies, nor yet any part thereof extended more than the rest, because of the Mountains.</p>

For the Moon posited in <hi>Mediis Tenebris,</hi> is then understood to be in Opposition to the Sun. By these defects therefore, the Motions and Mutations of the Moon are found out, and rationally Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated.</p>

Earth to be Conical, Terminating in a Sharp Point: And in the same places of the Moons Transits to be sometimes thicker, otherwhiles more slender, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding a certain Rule and Respect had to the Sun's Motion: And consequently that the Sun is mov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, (or so seems to be) in an Eccentrical <hi>Orb.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Hence likewise we gather, That the Sun is far greater than the Earth, and the Moon lesser: so the <hi>Solar</hi> Eclipses demonstrate the Distances of the Lumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries from the Earth to be different, and therefore to be moved in Eccentriques or Epicycles. Hereby also is found out a Rule for measuring the Distances of the Sun and Moon from the Earth, and the Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitudes of their several Bodies.</p>
                     <p>And lastly , by Eclipses of the Luminaries, The God of Nature forewarns this sinful world of the Revolutions of Kingdoms and States, the Death and Detriment of Princes, Governours and Great men, of Heresies, Sects, and Seditions in the Church, Alterations of Laws and Customs, of Drought and Inundations of Rivers, Wars, Famine, Plague and Pestilence, In a word, the vicissitude of all sublunary things.

                     <p>NOw, as touching the Effects of Eclipses, it hath been an Antiently receiv'd Opinion: That whatsoever the Sun and Moon, and the rest of the Planets and Stars, bring to pass upon these Inferior Bodi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="105" facs="tcp:49861:69"/>
granted, it must necessarily follow, that the action of the Luminary deficient, being diminished in Partil, or wholly intermitted, in Total Eclipses, these Sublunaries should meet with and suffer great Alterations: because the Sun and Moon are the Primary Coelestial Causes of all Sublunary Effects.</p>
                     <p>But <hi>Johannes Baptista Morinus, Astrolog. Gallic. Lib.</hi> 11. tells us, That Light doth only Illuminate, and nothing else. And (<hi>Lib.</hi> 12.) That besides Light, there is an actual Heat in the Sun, and in all the Stars proper and peculiar Influences, which penetrate the body of the Earth, and do not less affect and dispose it from the places beneath, than such as are above it. And therefore Eclipses of the Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minaries are not to be considered only, as to a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of their Light, in these Sublunaries; but as those Eclipses are never, but in their Conjunctions or Oppositions, whereby they emit their Influence more powerfully than in any other Aspect whatsoever.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore both Astronomers and Astrologers ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve the same moment of time, in which the middle of an Eclipse happens; The first, whereby to rectifie the Tables of their Motions: the Later, to the end that by a Coelestial Figure (erected to that moment of time) they may see what Effects an Eclipse may produce in these Inferiours; not in respect of the Light deficient, which (saith he) the Learned Astrologers regard not, but of their Influence. Which being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, he further saith—</p>
                     <p>That in superterranean Eclipses of the Sun, we are depriv'd of his Light and Heat, Totally, if the Eclipse be Total, and in part, if but Partil; and that so long as the Eclipse lasts. But we are not depriv'd of the Sun's Influence: or at least no longer than while the Sun is under the Earth, which every night causeth
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:49861:70"/>
a Total <hi>Solar</hi> Eclipse, for many hours together. For as the Influence of the Sun (whilst under the Earth) penetrates the same (as is evident from the Figures of those are born by night) so the Influence of the Sun above the Earth, penetrates the Dense and Opa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cous Body of the Moon Eclipsing him: which neither the Sun's Light, or Heat, could penetrate, she be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as black as Ink it self, whilst under the Sun's Discus, as (by an Optique Tube) may easily be observed.</p>
                     <p>But Subterranean <hi>Solar</hi> Eclipses (at leastwise such as be Total) do more affect the upper Hemisphere of the Earth, then the Superterranean: and the Reason is, because the Influence of the Sun is not of infinite ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue: and therefore if it should penetrate the Earth's G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>In those Eclipses therefore (at least such as are Total) we suffer by reason of the Imminute Influence of the Sun toward us: which (he thought) might be the cause, why for 30 years together, so much War, and all manner of mischiefs raged in this Hemisphere of the Earth, which <hi>Europe</hi> divideth. For as much as all that while, very many Total, and nigh Total Eclipses of the Sun, happen'd in the Lower Hemisphere, as may be seen in <hi>Origanus,</hi> who very carefully hath noted and supputated both Superterranean, and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terranean, whilst scarce two notable Ones fell out in our Hemisphere.</p>

                     <p>But we are not more deprived of the Influence and Elemental Efficacies of the Moon, than if there had
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:49861:70"/>
been no Eclipse at all: because that between Her and Us, there is nothing interposed, which might dull or diminish her Elemental or Influential vertues. And this is true (at least in respect of Influence) as well of Subterranean as Superterranean <hi>Lunar</hi> Eclipses. Whence it is, that the Sublunary Nature is more af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected by <hi>Solar</hi> Eclipses than Lunar, by reason of the thereon imminute Influence of the Sun towards us: and in all Eclipses the Influx of the Moon, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds the Influx of the Sun, but most in <hi>Lunar</hi> Eclipses.</p>
                     <p>He condemns the Ancients, who thought, that in Eclipses the Action of the Deficient Luminary ceased upon these Inferiours: because they supposed the Luminaries to Act by Light only; and were therefore unhappily Opinionated that some one of the Lesser Planets might execute the Office of the Deficient Luminary.</p>
                     <p>Again he saith, that the Earth and its Inhabitants are more strongly disposed by the Eclipses of the Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minaries, than by the other Conjunctions or Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions of the Sun and Moon: because <hi>virtus unita fortior est.</hi> But in Eclipses the Rays of the Sun and Moon are united upon the same time, (or very near it) which is drawn from them to the Earth. And the Earth is found (in a <hi>Solar</hi> Eclipse) within a Cone which drawn from both the Luminaries as from its Base, binds the Earth by its Ambite. But in a <hi>Lunar</hi> Eclipse 'tis found within a Column; the extreams whereof are the <hi>Disci</hi> of the Sun and Moon, Besides, in every Eclipse both the Luminaries are under the Ecliptick, where the Zodiacal vertue most flourisheth. Whence it followeth, That an Eclipse, by how much greater and of longer continuance it is, by so much greater are the effects it produceth. Because that in
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:49861:71"/>
great Eclipses the Central Raies of the Sun and Moon, are more united in the same Line which passeth over the Earth, and remain longer united.</p>
                     <p>Then he condemns <hi>Ptolemy</hi> and all other Astrolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, even till these present days, as much mistaken about Eclipses, in these two following things.</p>
                     <p>First, in limiting the places of the Earth to which the Effects of every Eclipse belong. For that they would have them appropriated to those Regions and Provinces which are under the Sign wherein the Eclipse falls, or others of the same Trigon, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to that distribution of the Earth which <hi>Ptolemy</hi> hath allotted to the twelve Signs of the Zodiaque. But forasmuch as that Distribution is but a meer Fiction (as he hath endeavoured to prove, <hi>Lib.</hi> 20. <hi>Sect.</hi> 1. <hi>Cap.</hi> 2.) it is evident they have erred in limiting cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain places of the Earth, wherein the Effects of an Eclipse shall happen: and the rather, for that an Eclipse (as every other Lunation) is an Universal Cause, universally active throughout the whole Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuit of the Earth: but in every place thereof parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly Active, according to the particular posture of the Eclipse, and of the whole Heavens in respect of that place of the Earth, wherein yet an Eclipse is frequently not allowed to have any Effect, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Ancients: because the place is not under the Sign wherein the defect happens, or any of that Trigon , which (saith he) is <hi>Hallucinatio intolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilis, &amp; ab Astrologicis principiis alienissima.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And to such as (by way of Objection) do offer <hi>Ptolemy's Doctrine,</hi> viz. <hi>Pro locis particularibus &amp; urbibus advertere ad loca Luminarium, &amp; Cardines figurae Coelestis, sub qua urbes ipsae conditae sunt, aut ad Medium Coeli in Genituris Principum, qui ipsis urbibus dominantur. Ac si haec familiaritatem, seu conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entiam
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:49861:71"/>
habeant cum locis Luminarium &amp; Cardinum, in figura Deliquii, Effectus ad ipsas urbes pertinere</hi>: He thus Answers;</p>
                     <p>That the Coelestial Bodies have no Influence on things made by Art at least <hi>per se,</hi> as he seems to have proved, <hi>Lib.</hi> 20. <hi>Sect.</hi> 4. <hi>Cap.</hi> 8. and therefore over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throws the foundation of that Doctrine of Cities, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it should be deduced from their Radical Figure, whereof notwithstanding scarce any One remaineth. Now, as to what belongs to the <hi>Medium Coeli</hi> of Princes, admitting the Familiarity aforesaid, <hi>viz.</hi> That an Eclipse happens in the <hi>Medium Coeli</hi> of the Radical Figure of a Prince: Or that in both Figures to wit, that of the Geniture, and the Eclipse, the <hi>Medium Coeli</hi> should be one and the same; that Eclipse indeed shall have signification upon the Actions and particular Fate of the Prince: But as for what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns the Citizens, Earth, Water, and Air, as Plagues, Barrenness, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they shall not be thence foreseen, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less peradventure by Accident, so far forth as the Prince (being actively or passively disposed to War) by the similitude of the Figures, Plagues and Barrenness, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> may thence ensue. But these things contribute nothing to the Constitution of the Air, at least of Heat, Cold, Moisture and Drought.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The second thing wherein he charges the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients to have Erred, is, in determining and limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Subject upon which an Eclipse shall especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally operate, by the Form and Nature of the Constel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation wherein the Eclipse falls; saying that if the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stellation be Human (as <hi>Gemini, Virgo, Aquarius,</hi> Men shall be affected: and if Beastial (as <hi>Aries, Taurus, Cancer; Leo,</hi> &amp;c.)

<pb n="110" facs="tcp:49861:72" rendition="simple:additions"/>
by the names of the Planets there predominating, whose Natures they resemble.</p>
                     <p>Thus much <hi>Morinus:</hi> whose new and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couth Doctrine, till either it be Refelled, or Received by the Learned, suspends my Judgments in this matter.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>That the Qualities are alter'd by the Influence of the Stars; and especially the Luminaries, is a thing not now to be doubted: it being sufficiently apparent in the four seasons of the year, how the Air with all Plants and Animals , <hi>&amp;c.</hi> do diversly admit of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration: and therefore the Watry Humors and the Spirit (being Aerial) are observed to operate more when they are excited, than otherwise: As when the Harp. is touched, it moves men to Dancing; when the Trumpet Sounds, to War like Employments.</p>
                     <p>Hence it appears that the universal Cause of all Crises is the Influence of the Heavens: For, the Coe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestial Bodies, by their Heat, Light, Motion, and Configuration or Aspects (to which St. <hi>Augustine</hi> adds <hi>Afflatum,</hi> that is , Inspiration or Instinction, and St. <hi>Thomas, Aptitudinis Efficaciam,</hi> a virtual Apti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, or fitness) do rule and govern, not only the Four Elements, but all Elementary Bodies, and especially Man, from the very first Moment of his Birth, until the Ultimate Minute of his Death, incit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him sometimes to Mirth, another while to Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, now to be Sick, anon Well again.

                     <p>But here we must Note, that in Acute Diseases, the Aspects or Radiations of the Moon, <hi>viz.</hi> her Quartiles and Oppositions, are not to be counted as if they should begin from her Conjunction with the Sun: but from the degree and minute she is in at the Beginning of the Disease, until her return to the same Radical Point, which is performed in 27 days, 8 hours, or thereabouts.</p>
                     <p>Of Acute Diseases, some are <hi>Acuti simpliciter,</hi> simply Acute; some <hi>Acuti, <gap reason="foreign">

                        <hi>Acuti ex decidentiâ,</hi> from Diminishing, or Dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, are such as are judged imperfectly: For sometimes they wax worse in respect of the Symptoms, and are sometimes Remitted, according as the Moon meets with the Good and Evil Aspects of the Good or Bad Planets: And oftentimes they Degenerate from being Acute, and become Chronical. As when a Pleurisie turns into an <hi>Empiema,</hi> or an Ulcer in the Breast: So when a <hi>Quotidian</hi> Feaver becomes a <hi>Hectick,</hi> or from an Intermittent degenerates into a <hi>Quotidian, &amp; Contrà.</hi> And these Diseases are judged within 40 Days.</p>

                     <p>Chronical Diseases follow the Motion of the Sun, Acquiring a Crisis after the 40<hi>th</hi> day, and Judgment when the Sun attains to the Quadrates, as is Evident in Hectiques, Dropsies, and Quaternaries: When he comes to the Sextiles and Trines there are only some Indicative Motions made of such Effects as follow in the Opposition.

                     <p>Nor shall I need to say any thing of the Sympathy and Antipathy, Power and Efficacy of the Stars, my room being so Narrow, and the same amply hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in several Learned Authors: Only, I think it requisite, (before I come to the manner of Acquiring the Critical and Judicative Days) to say something concerning the <hi>Terminus à quo,</hi> or the Point of time from whence they take their Original.</p>
                     <p>Seeing therefore that by these Critical and Decre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory days some Notable Alteration would be foreseen; tending either to the Health or Death of the Patient; 'tis fit we begin our Account from the first Notable Point of the Diseases Invasion: For, to Assign a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning to the Disease, is a thing very hard to be done, as <hi>Galen</hi> himself confesseth, <hi>Lib.</hi> 1. <hi>Cap.</hi> 6. <hi>Exactè primum Principium ferè est insensibile.</hi> The time when the Sick-party takes his Bed, is the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of his Decumbiture, but not the beginning of the Disease: For, a Man that is strong and robust endures a Disease more easily, and takes not his Bed so soon as a Man that is tender, weak, or fearful of Mind; who suspecting himself upon every Idle Pinch; gets forthwith to Bed: Nevertheless in many Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases, (as the <hi>Vertigo, Epilepsie, Paralysis, Apoplexy, Hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrhagia, Plurisie</hi> and the like,) it is easie to find out the precise Beginning or Hour the Disease Invadeth: And the Learned in Astrology do believe and affirm, that the Moment of time to be taken for the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Disease, is the very Instant in which a

Man shall perceive any manifest Hurt, or Malady in his Body, as when he begins to lie down and be Sick of a Feaver: but not when the Head akes, or that he suffers any other trivial Symptom: Because these are not Feavers, but rather <hi>Febrium Nuntii,</hi> the Messengers of Feavers.</p>
                     <p>Thus <hi>Hippocrates</hi> observed his Indications from the day a Man Sickned of a Feaver, but not from the day whereon he perceived a Heaviness of the Body only, or was troubled with the Head-Ach. For, by how much sharper and more violent the Feaver is, by so much is it the more Manifest to sense, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible the first Assault, or Invasion thereof should be hid from the Patient.</p>
                     <p>It now follows that I shew the manner of number<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and determining these Critical days by the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Moon; because the Radix and Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of this Doctrine is of all Astrologers, and by <hi>Hippocrates</hi> and <hi>Galen</hi> themselves said to consist in her Efficacy, and in the Motion and Position of the Parts of the Zodiaque.</p>
                     <p>And first I will shew you the manner of finding out the Critical and Indicative days by an Octogo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, or Figure of 8 sides, according to the Opinion of <hi>Hippocrates</hi> and <hi>Galen,</hi> the construction whereof follows.</p>
                     <p>First, find the Place of the Moon to the beginning of the <hi>Patient's Decumbiture</hi> as before you were taught.</p>
                     <p>Next, let a Circle be described and divided into 8. equal parts, representing the Zodiaque, wherein the Moon is moved: And let the Degree and Minute the Moon is in at the Hour of the Patients Decum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biture, be Posited in the first division or Angle of the Figure, which shall be accounted as the Ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant or First-House.</p>

                     <p>Now seeing it is manifest (by what hath been said) that the Critical days are made in such time as the Moon (counting from the time of the Decumbiture, or the first Paroxism of the Disease) shall have run through one fourth part of the Zodiaque, or 90 de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, wherein she produced the first <hi>Crisis,</hi> or Alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration in the Disease, which commonly happens on the <hi>Seventh</hi> day, yet we must note that it may fall out on the <hi>Sixth,</hi> (if the Moon be swift in Motion) or (if slow) on the <hi>Eighth</hi> day.

Radical place with a Quartile, which you will find to be the 9<hi>th.</hi> day of <hi>January,</hi> for on that day at Noon her true place is 6 degrees, 11 minutes of ♉. and the 10. day at Noon in 18 degrees, 34 Minutes of ♉. wherefore her Diurnal Motion is 12 degrees, 25 minutes, and the distance from the place of her Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drature, 4 degrees, 8 minutes, which had, I reason thus—</p>
                     <p>As her Diurnal Motion, 12 degr. 25 min. to 24 hours;</p>

                     <p>In the same manner do I find out the Time of the other <hi>Crises</hi> and Indicatives, and after that the state and disposition of the Heavens, agreeing to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Critical Phasis, as is evident by the following Synopsis.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>Furthermore, <hi>Jupiter</hi> in a movable Sign in the Fifth House, (which rules the Stomach, Liver, and the Sides, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> combust and wounded by the Quartile of <hi>Mars,</hi> brought the Pleurisie upon him; and because <hi>Mercury</hi> (Afflicted by the Malevolent Planets) is here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by rendered Malevolent, he gave him the Dry-Cough.</p>
                     <p>Moreover, the Moon in <hi>Aquarius</hi> applying to <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn</hi> argues that the Cause of the Disease proceeded from the Weariness of a Journey, according to the Doctrine of <hi>Hermes</hi> and <hi>Hippocrates.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now for determining the length or shortness of the Disease, consider these <hi>Aphorisms.</hi>
                     </p>

                        <hi>Sexta Domus in Signo Fixo, Morbi Longitudinem pollicetur. Item, Saturnus existens Dominus sextae, &amp; in Signo Fixo, longum praesagit morbum.

equivalent to a Quadrate, I gather that the Principal Authors of this Disease are <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Mars</hi>; which together excited a very long Burning Feaver: Then <hi>Mercury</hi> the dry Cough, and at last <hi>Jupiter</hi> the Plurisie; the which (together with the Cough) soon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ended than the Feaver, for that <hi>Mercury</hi> and <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter</hi> were both constituted in a movable Sign.</p>

                     <p>IT will not be (I hope) ungrateful to the Ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, if I recollect and commend unto their, and my own contemplation, the Causes of the Mutations, Inclinations and Eversions of Empires, Kingdoms and Commonwealths; and the rather, because (as I suppose) Time never produced an Age so full of Prodigies, nor a Generation of Men so inclin'd to Novelty, as now the present; wherein every day pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents a New Inquiry, every Month a fresh Vicissitude.</p>
                     <p>The Politiques distinguish the Causes of all Muta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions into Two sorts; First, and Second.</p>
                     <p>The First cause is God, the Creator and Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of all things: For, notwithstanding the Actions of all Individual Human Creatures be in a Human Power; yet the Constitutions, Governments and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servations of Human Communions and Societies, or Republiques, are not so in the Power of Men, but depend wholly upon the First and Supreme Cause, and the disposition thereof: And for as much as God per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms his greatest works in the world by Angels; it
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:49861:80"/>
is not impossible, or strange, if I say and aver, that every Empire, Kingdom and Republique, hath some certain Angel and <hi>Genius</hi> peculiarly appropriated thereunto) as a Governour ordained by God. For this is the constant opinion of the <hi>Jews,</hi> who believe that every Person and Place, hath a certain Guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian Angel set over it; nor do a few Doctors of the Catholick Church believe otherwise, whilst in <hi>Dan.</hi> 10, 11. there is mention made of an Angel Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of <hi>Persia,</hi> and <hi>Grece</hi>; and that the Apostle (<hi>Ephes.</hi> 3.) expresly constitutes a certain Order of Angels, which he calls <hi>Potestates,</hi> [Rulers, or Potentates; or as our <hi>English</hi> Translation hath it, Principalities and Powers.]</p>
                     <p>God hath set certain Intervals, and Periods of times, to all Empires, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> amongst which Periods, the 500. and 700. years are accounted most Fatal, as you may see in Bodin, <hi>Lib.</hi> 4. <hi>Cap.</hi> 2. but especially in <hi>Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terus, Ax.</hi> 1.2. <hi>&amp; seq.</hi> And the natural reason here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, is, for that in this space of time, there clapseth the sixth Generation of Men; which abateth of, and more and more declineth from, the simplicity, strength and fortitude of those Men, who at first obtained and preserved Empires, by such vertues: For like as the Bodies of Men became weak and feeble in the fourth and fifth Generation, even so also decreaseth the strength and fortitude, whereby Kingdoms are acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, preserved and propagated.</p>
                     <p>Besides, it hath been observed, that at the end of every 30<hi>th.</hi> year, there usually falls out some one or other Mutation in Empires, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> because that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter so many years, such men as formerly had the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of Affairs and things therein, do (for the most part) leave their Station: and that from thence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth New Ones succeed them, who in the space of
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:49861:81"/>
Thirty years more grow up, and introduce new Customs and Opinions in the Commonwealth: as you may read in <hi>Richterus, Axiom,</hi> 9.</p>
                     <p>Moreover, it is certain, that as God hath appointed fatal Bounds, and Limits of time to all Empires, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> so hath he the like Bounds and Limits to all other particular places; and when any change of Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pires, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is imminent, he commonly raiseth up some great Heroes, whom he useth as Organs, to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish or amend them: yet first revealeth such future changes by certain Signs and Prodigies. <hi>Vid. Bodin. Lib.</hi> 4. <hi>Cap.</hi> 2. <hi>Richt. Axiom.</hi> 19. And thus much of the first cause of the Changes of Empires, King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, and Republiques, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Second Cause, is either Natural, or Moral.</p>
                     <p>The Natural cause, is either Superior, or Inferior.</p>
                     <p>The Superior Natural Cause, is the Motion and Influence of the Planets and Stars upon these Inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours; touching which, the Ingenious <hi>Keckerman, Lib.</hi> 1. <hi>Cap.</hi> 26. delivers this Canon.</p>

Thus He; and that very truly: For although God the Author of Nature, and the First Cause of every Good thing, changes Countries and Transfers Kingdoms at his pleasure: yet seeing he hath engraven in the Book of Nature (and chiefly, in Heaven, which measureth Times) the Motions and Mutations of all things, things that be Invisible even his own eternal Power, for the greatest part; yea and exposed Heaven unto our view, that it might be for signs of Present and Future things: I shall not think it contrary to true Religion, or Good Manners, if (with Fear and Reverence) I enquire the Superior Natural Causes of those Mutations, so long as I ascribe no necessity thereunto; Maugre the Croaking and Coaxation of some few Epileptique Prophets and other Religious Lunatiques, who prate and perswade the Contrary.</p>
                     <p>The First Cause, is, the Change of the Absides of the Planets, whereby the Five Planets together with the Sun, transfer the Places in which they are highest and most remote from the Center of the Earth,
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:49861:82"/>
so also the Places wherein they are lowest and nearest thereunto; and together with those Places, their swiftness and slowness of Motion, into several parts of the Zodiaque, according to the succession of the Signs: whereof Cardan, <hi>Seg.</hi> 1. <hi>Aph.</hi> 37. in these words, <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutationes Absidum, Regna, &amp; Regiones, &amp; Religiones mutant.</hi> Changes of the Absides alter Kingdoms, Regions and Religions.</p>

                        </gap>r Authors, the Absis of <hi>Saturn</hi> continues in <hi>Sagittary</hi> for many years yet to come; For by the <hi>Philolaique</hi> Tables (the best extant) it enters not <hi>Capricorn</hi> until the beginning of the year 1728. and therefore it could not in the least be (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less we will have the Effect precede its Cause) that <hi>Mahomets</hi> Destruction commenc'd (in this respect) in, or near the year 1630. Nevertheless, I believe (with <hi>Spinaeus</hi>) that the many Revolutions of the Heavens, in, and about that year, have already pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced a sensible Commencement of Detriment unto him; yet conclude not his final Destruction, until after the year 1728.

                     <p>A Third Cause is, the change of the Obliquity of the Zodiack, which (when at the greatest) accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Bullialdus,</hi> is, 23°. 52′. 53″. And this was <hi>Anno Nabonassari,</hi> 381. (367 years before the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity of Christ.)

                     <p>In the year 1653. the greatest Obliquity of the Zodiack was 23°. 31′. 55″. For the Motion of the Anomaly of the Zodiack's Obliquity, was 6<hi rend="sup">s</hi>. 21°. 49′.

                     <p>The Internal, is either on the Prince's or Subject's part.</p>
                     <p>The Internal on the Prince's part admits this gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Canon.</p>
                     <p>The beginnings of Princes are for the most part good, but their Progress worse: From which Change arise great Mutations in Publick Affairs and things.</p>
                     <p>The Internal Cause (also) of Changes in respect of the Prince, is either Ethical, or Political.</p>
                     <p>Touching Ethical Causes, there are these Canons:</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Intemperance and Lust of Princes occasion change of the Common-wealth.</p>

                     <p>Political Causes of Changes, are either in respect of the Foundation of the Principality, or of the Office and Care of the Prince.</p>
                     <p>As touching the Causes respecting the Foundation of the Principality, there be these Canons:</p>
                     <p n="1">1. It is impossible any Common-wealth should long be safe, where the Prince comes to Rule, either by a
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:49861:86"/>
violent Invasion, or a crafty Subreption, without any access to the Principality.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The Perjuries of Princes; that is, when they keep not their Oaths made to their Subjects, at the time they were called to Govern, bring upon King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms dangerous Changes and Conversions.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The Authority of a Prince decreasing produceth Change; and when the Periods of Empires are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved, the Authority of those that Govern, faileth.</p>
                     <p>The Causes that respect the Care or Office of the Prince, have these Canons.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. When the Prince listens not to Wise and Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Councellors, Changes are imminent.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. When Publick Judgments are corrupted, and hainous Impieties remain unpunished, Changes are at hand.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. When the Prince affords not the Subject a Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and necessary Defence, but suffers him to be vexed and trampled over by Incursions of Enemies, Changes ensue.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. When the Revenues of a Kingdom decrease, of necessity a Change must follow: For Moneys are the Nerves of Empires.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. When the Prince doth too much Poll his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects with heavy Tributes and Exactions, a Change succeedeth.</p>

                     <p>And, as in Humane Bodies some are more strong, vigorous, and of better Constitution than others, and

therefore of longer continuance: Even so in Empires, Kingdoms, and Common-wealths, some preserve them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves longer, for that either they are by Nature more strenuous and stable, (as having propitious Stars, and they well Fortified at the time of their first Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:) Or because the Situation of them is Naturally stronger than others, as we see at this day in the Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nory of <hi>Venice.</hi> The like holdeth in Cities and Towns, in particular Families, Laws, Conclaves, and Councils, in Religions, Heresies, and Schisms.</p>
                     <p>The consideration whereof prevents my Wonder at the Vicissitudes and Changes here on Earth: I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count it no Miracle to see a Monarchy Eclipsed in its greatest Glory, and the ruine of one, the raising of another.

                        <p>And the <hi>Scotch</hi> History tells us, that in the Year 1214. there were two Comets seen at a time, one in the Morning going before the Sun, the other in the Evening following after. <hi>Anno</hi> 1529. there were four seen. <hi>Anno</hi> 1337. in <hi>May,</hi> there appeared a Comet, and soon after another, which joyned its self to the former, both which were very conspicuous all the <hi>June, July,</hi> and <hi>August</hi> following.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Scaliger (Exer.</hi> 79. in <hi>Cardan.</hi>) tells us, that at what time the <hi>French</hi> King Invaded <hi>Italy,</hi> there was a Comet seen at Sun-set, which in few days after over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took and conducted him: And withal addeth, <hi>Nos duos simul videmus, alterum matutinum, alterum ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinum, multis diebus, diversa latitudine haud ita multis abhinc annis.</hi> I my self (saith he) saw two at once, not many Years since, one in the Morning, the other in the Evening, for many days together. But in the Year 1618. there were two infallibly seen at once in the Morning in <hi>India</hi> and <hi>Persia.</hi> Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless, it hath sometimes fallen out, that when indeed there hath been but one Comet, yet (because per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps it was first seen in the Morning before Sun-rise, and afterwards became <hi>Vespertine,</hi> its Declination and
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:49861:90"/>

                        <p>Moreover, <hi>Aristotle</hi> informs us, <hi>lib.</hi> 1. <hi>Meteor. cap.</hi> 6. that in the 450 Year before Christ, or thereabouts, <hi>Democritus</hi> saw a Comet dissolved into many Stars; and <hi>Ephorus</hi> the Historian affirms, that the great Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met, <hi>Anno</hi> 372. before Christ, (which preceded the sad Fate of <hi>Helice</hi> and <hi>Bura,</hi> two Cities in <hi>Achaia,</hi> both swallowed up of the Sea,) divided it self into two unknown Stars.</p>
                        <p>So <hi>Dio</hi> testifies, that the Comet which hover'd so long over <hi>Rome, Anno</hi> 13. before Christ, was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards dissolved into many Faces or Stars; and <hi>Kepler</hi> thinks no otherwise of the two Comets by him observed, <hi>Anno</hi> 1618.</p>

That in 1585. not above a Span in appearance; and that other, 1590. ten degrees. But the Tail of the Comet in 1618. was more notable for Magnitude, and variety of Magnitude than all the rest; for that in the same Nights it appeared of different lengths, not only to sundry Observers in several places, but to the same Observer in one and the same place; now shorter, anon longer, by the quavering extension of its Beams. For <hi>Millerus</hi> found it, <hi>Novemb.</hi> 26. when it first ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, 90 degrees: <hi>Kepler</hi> two days after.

                        <p>But the Tails of those Comets that appeared in the Years of Christ, 70. 400. 1472 . and l543. were ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served to reach even to the Earth.</p>

obtinuerunt, in vicem conferantur, viz.</hi> By these Porrections (or stretchings out) of the Tail (saith he) before expressed, it is evidently gathered that the same have been every where exactly averse from the Sun, if so be the Positions of the Sun, and the places of the Comet's Head (which at those times they pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed) be compared together. Nevertheless, <hi>Tycho</hi> acknowledges, that the Tail of the Comet in 1577. was directly opposed to <hi>Venus,</hi> not the Sun, which he rather attributes to some secret Optical Cause, than he would admit <hi>Venus</hi> could cast out such strong Rays. But whether for some hidden Optical Reason (as <hi>Tycho</hi> thinks) or because the Head of the Comet is not exactly Sphaerical, (as <hi>Cabaeus</hi> supposes) certain it is, that the Tail sometimes seems to recede a little from the place opposite to the Sun; for so <hi>Kepler</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self acknowledges, <hi>pag.</hi> 54. <hi>Solemne hoc est Cometis quod caudae ipsorum nonnihil ab opposito Solis de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flectant.</hi> This is ordinary (saith he) with Comets, that their Tails do somewhat incline from the places opposite to the Sun.</p>
                        <p>The like may be said of the Comet in 1618. the Tail whereof <hi>Kepler,</hi> the 9<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>December,</hi> found to be rather opposed to <hi>Mercury</hi> than the Sun. <hi>Johan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes Hommelius</hi> likewise Observed, that the Tail of the Comet in 1556. did not exactly oppose the Sun, so long as it was distant from him less than a Quadrant (or 90 degrees) but that afterwards it tended directly to the Quarter opposite to the Sun. By all which it appears, that this deflection from the opposite place of the Sun, arises <hi>per accidens,</hi> from the Position of the Sun, the Comet, and Observer; other secret Causes, perhaps, concurring in the matter and shape of the Head, or from the transverse distance and motion there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: But doubtless of it self, it always respects the

                           <pb n="157" facs="tcp:49861:95"/>2. Some account them not any thing existing, <hi>de novo,</hi> but rather a meer <hi>Symphasis,</hi> or Co-apparency of many known Stars united by a corporal Conjunction, and by that means representing a kind of a longer Star.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. A third sort think that a Comet is a wandring Star, or some Planet (not of the seven commonly known, but some other strange one) seldom ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing, either by reason of its nearness to the Sun, it's too far distance from the Earth, or the grosser parts of the Heaven and Air where it is, and which after some space of time coming to a more convenient di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance from the Sun, or nearer the Earth, or else by reason of some intercurrent more Diaphanous parts of Heaven, or the Air; or, for some other secret Cause, becomes conspicuous.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. Another sort suppose, that Comets are an ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregate of many incorruptible little Stars, formerly joyned together as one entire Body, and which (after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards separating) cease to be visible.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. <hi>Aristotle</hi> and his followers hold, that a Comet is a Fiery Meteor, newly generated of the great plenty of Exhalations, drawn up from the Earth and Sea, into the Supream Region of the Air, where it is easily distinguished from the thin Air, and being well com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pact obtains a consistency; and for that it is carried about by the Motion of the <hi>Primum Mobile,</hi> (by which the Supream Air is also moved) begetteth Fire, and retaineth the same until the Sulphurous Unctious Fat, and Nitrous plenty of Exhalations, gathered together, (either at first, or successively) administreth Matter or Sustenance of a Flame, which ceasing, the Comet by little and little diminisheth, and at length is wholly extinguished.</p>

                        <p n="7">7. Another sort, That a Comet is a Sublunary Matter, arising from the most subtil breathings or va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours, but not so much inflamed as illustrated of the Sun; like as it were to Glass Pots (distain'd with a yellow or Ruddy colour) and full of water, for the Diaphaniety or transparency thereof.</p>
                        <p n="8">8. Others be of Opinion, that Comets are made, <hi>de novo,</hi> of a Coelestial Matter, not by Generation of a new substantial Form, but by condensation with a mixture of Opacity and Diaphaniety, which receive and transmit the Light of the Sun: Or by an addition of Light made in the parts of Heaven.</p>
                        <p n="9">9. A Ninth sort suppose they are generated, <hi>de novo,</hi> in Heaven, of a Coelestial Matter, and afterwards all, or many of them corrupted.</p>
                        <p n="10">10. <hi>Kepler</hi> was the only Man believed them gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated of Coelestial Matter, but that nevertheless some descended below the Moon.</p>

                        <p n="12">12. The twelfth and last Opinion is not differing from all the rest, but rather distinguishing Coelestial from Elementary Comets, in respect of their Place and

Matter: For it admitteth some Comets to be genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted below the Moon, (by the breathings of the Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>restrial Globe,) either inflamed or illuminated: Yet that some are above the Moon, and of a Coelestial Matter.</p>
                        <p>For my own part, in regard of the incertainty of all other Opinions, I willingly incline to that which attributes the Generation and Government of Comets to God, or the Intelligences: Or to such as reckon them among the <hi>Arcana</hi> of the World, and the most hidden Miracles of Nature: In which Number are, <hi>Messabala, Hagecius, Rhodius, Regiomontanus, Tycho,</hi> and many others: For the Dotages of <hi>Bodin,</hi> and some others, who suppose Comets were the Souls of Illustri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Men triumphing in Heaven: Or of those that thought them to be Fires conveyed to and fro by Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits: I shall not trouble the Reader with such Phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tasms.</p>

                        <p>IT has been a received Opinion in all Ages, that Comets are certain Funebrious Appearances, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret Fires and Torches of Death rather than of Life, and were ever look'd upon as the threatning Eyes of Divine Vengeance, and the Tongue of an Ireful Deity, portending the Death of Princes, Plague of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, Famine, and Earthquakes, with horrid and terrible Tempests.</p>

                           <hi>Cicero (lib.</hi> 2. <hi>de nat.

                        <p>The great Naturalist, <hi>Pliny,</hi> tells us no less in these words, <hi>Cometes terrificum magna ex parte Sydus, ac non leviter piatum, ut Civili motu Octavio Consule, iterumque Pompeii ac Caesaris bello; in nostro vero aevo circa venificium quo</hi> Claudius Caesar <hi>Imperium reliquit</hi> Domitio Neroni, <hi>ac deinde Principatu ejus, assiduum prope ac saevum.</hi> A Comet is a terrible Star, for the most part, and not easily purged away by Sacrifice, as in the Civil War whilst <hi>Octavius</hi> was Consul: And again, in the War betwixt <hi>Pompey</hi> and <hi>Caesar</hi>; but in our Age (saith he) it was in a manner assiduous and cruel about the Feat of Poysoning, whereby <hi>Claudius Caesar</hi> left the Empire to <hi>Domitius Nero</hi>; and no less afterwards by his Sovereignty.</p>
                        <p>So likewise <hi>Suetonius</hi> (writing on <hi>Claudius, cap.</hi> 26.) <hi>Praesagia mortis ejus praecipua fuerunt exortus Stellae Crinitae, quam Cometem vocant:</hi> The chief Presages of his Death, were the arisings of the Hairy Star, they call a Comet.</p>

That is to say, Dearth of Corn, and Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renness; that the Earth as it were by lying fallow, might in the interim be fitted and prepared to a plenty of all Fruits.

(<hi>Stilo veteri</hi>) about Nine a Clock at Night, I first beheld this Comet below the hinder-most Star in the Constellation of the <hi>Hare,</hi> but some few degrees to the East thereof. It was likewise seen the same Evening by Mr. <hi>Childrey</hi> of <hi>Feversham</hi> in <hi>Kent,</hi> (as I have it from a good hand) but neither he nor my self could as then perceive any Tail visible; what it had before the Moon was up, I know not. I have heard of some who say they saw it the sixth or seventh day: And 'tis very probable the first appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance thereof might be about the Full Moon, (<hi>Dec.</hi> 5.) or rather (as I suppose) upon the Quartile of

This Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning also it was observed by the Astronomical Reader of <hi>Gresham</hi> Colledge, (as I am inform'd) and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards (so often as the Air would permit him) till it vanished.

                           <q>In the Consideration of general Events, Comets are also to be observed, whether they appear in E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clipses, or at any other time, or of what form or name soever they be; for they produce Effects like those that be caused of <hi>Mars</hi> and <hi>Mercury</hi>; as Wars, Strifes, Turbulent Motions, and such other Events as usually follow these. But unto what places they menace and threaten their Effects, those parts of the Zodiack in which they are first collected and fixed, as also the inclinations of the Comets Rays (in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of the form thereof) do declare. But by the Face and Shape, as it were, of that blazing Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, the kind of the Effect, and the Matter into which it will change, shall be known. The dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Flame shall inform us of the intention or remission of the Events: The Comets positure to the Sun, the beginning of their Operation: For, when they are Matutine and burn long, they argue swifter Events; but being Vespertine, slower.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>By which words <hi>Ptolemy</hi> insinuateth three things to be considered in Comets, <hi>viz.</hi> The Quality, Place, and Time of their Effects.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. For the Quality or Nature thereof; I am tyed by the Rules of Art, to consider (in the first place) the Situation of the Orb, at the beginning, or middle appearance of a Comet, or else to the time of the swiftest Motion thereof: But forasmuch as not one of those three times can certainly be known, I am re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved (by the Examples of <hi>Haly, Cardan, Longo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>montanus,</hi> and others) to Examine the Figures of Heaven erected to the Full Moon of <hi>Decemb.</hi> 5. at 2.
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:49861:102"/>
a Clock and 26 Minutes in the Morning: And the Quartile of <hi>Jupiter</hi> and <hi>Mars,</hi> the 7<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>December,</hi> at 6 in the Morning; at or near upon which times this Comet (questionless) appeared. And that Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net which shall be Lord of the place of the Comet, and of the preceding Angle, (because the Motion there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of was contrary to the succession of Signs) I shall take to be Lord of the Figure, and Comet, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently the Significator of future Events.</p>
                        <p>In the Full Moon preceding (or incident with) this Comet, the Moon was above the Earth (and so the Luminary of the time) in the 24. degree of <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini</hi>; whereof <hi>Mercury</hi> is Dispositer, and together with the Sun opposing her, <hi>Mars</hi> Lord of the Angle preceding, applying to a Quartile of <hi>Jupiter,</hi> and upon the Cuspe of the Ascendant.</p>
                        <p>In the Quartile of <hi>Jupiter</hi> and <hi>Mars,</hi> the 27. degree of <hi>Taurus</hi> is the Cuspe of the West Angle, the most part of <hi>Gemini (viz.</hi> 24. degrees thereof) being in the same Angle, and therewith the Comet: <hi>Mercury</hi> Lord of the place of the Comet; <hi>Mars</hi> of the Angle precedent, and the Moon in Quartile to <hi>Mars,</hi> and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to <hi>Jupiter.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Whereby it appears, that <hi>Mercury</hi> and <hi>Mars</hi> are as well the Accidental, as Natural Lords of this Comet, and therefore the Events thereon depending of their Nature.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Secondly, we must consider it as to the colour thereof: <hi>Color enim significat naturam Planetae domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nantis</hi>; for, the colour of a Comet signifies the Nature of the Ruling Planet. This was of a Fiery Red, but mixed with a dusky Silver colour, which made it look but dim in appearance, (unless in clear Nights before the Moon was up, for then it look'd more Rutilant:) and therefore it was likewise in this respect of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:49861:102"/>
of <hi>Mars</hi> and <hi>Mercury,</hi> as shall also be the Effects thereof; which nevertheless will not be so Noble, as if it had been of a more Glorious and Splendent co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour; <hi>Stella, quo magis est lucida, eo nobilioris censetur naturae</hi>: By how much brighter any Star or Comet is, by so much it is supposed to be of a more Noble Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. The Form or Shape thereof is next to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served; for this also partly denotes the Nature of the Planet unto which it belongs, and by consequence the quality of the Effects: <hi>Quae Crinita, versicolor, vel bene caudata,</hi> Mercurius <hi>est.</hi> The Comet that is Hairy, of sundry colours, or very much Tailed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to <hi>Mercury.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="4">4. The fourth thing considerable (as to the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of its Effects) is the Magnitude thereof, (I mean, first, of the Head of the Comet) for the knowledge of which there are three things necessarily requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.
<list>
                              <item>1. The apparent Diameter of its <hi>Discus.</hi>
                              </item>
                              <item>2. The Distance thereof from the Center of the Earth.</item>
                              <item>3. That the Head thereof be Sphaerical, or near Sphaerical.</item>
                           </list>
                        </p>
                        <p>But for my own part, as I was not furnished with Instruments proper for this purpose, so I cannot hear of any one of our Learned <hi>English</hi> Astronomers (and we have not a few such in <hi>Oxford</hi> and elsewhere in <hi>England</hi>) unless at <hi>London,</hi> the Reader of <hi>Gresham</hi> Colledge, that made any Curious Observations there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: What was done by <hi>Gassendus, Bullialdus, Heve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius,</hi> or other Famous Observers in Foreign Parts, will doubtless e're long be produced to Light.</p>
                        <p>The Diameter of it (as it appear'd to the Eye) was not so little as 15 Inches, (I mean, when it seemed
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:49861:103"/>
greatest:) And therefore if, as saith the Gentleman, formerly, and but now instanced, All the Symptoms thereof agree with those which have been evinced to be Coelestial, it must needs be of a huge and incredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Magnitude: Which imports the Fame, Renown, and Vehemency of its Effects: For, <hi>quo major est, Stella, eo est Efficacior.</hi> The greater any Star or Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met is, the more Efficacious. Nevertheless, it is true, and I instance it by way of Caution, that lesser Stars do often-times Operate more effectually upon Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lunary things, than others that be greater; but it is when nearer thereunto.</p>
                        <p>The like knowledge should (next) be had of the Magnitude of the Tail thereof, (which nevertheless is more uncertain, by reason of the inconstant vibra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and ejection of its Rays,) but having not the distance of the Comets Head, nor the distance of the extremity of the Tail thereof from the Centre of the Earth; neither the apparent distance of the Head, from the extremity of the Tail; (which three things are necessarily requisite hereunto,) I forbear further men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. The Fifth and last thing Observable are the Fixed Stars, near to which this Comet first appeared. Touching which, we must note, That this Comet first began in the last part of the Bull's Asterism, wherein are the Horns of the Bull, <hi>Aldebaran,</hi> and the <hi>Hyades,</hi> Stars so called, of the Nature of <hi>Mars</hi>: So like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise the Buckler, Foot, and left Shoulder of <hi>Orion</hi>; of the Nature of <hi>Mars, Mercury, Jupiter,</hi> and <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn</hi>; and which are usually the Causes of Lightning, Thunder, and Fiery Impressions.</p>
                        <p>Thus then it appears, that the quality of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents presaged by this Comet, are clearly of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of <hi>Mercury</hi> and <hi>Mars</hi>: And to tell you what they are, is the next thing intended.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="173" facs="tcp:49861:103"/>The Dominion of <hi>Mercury</hi> portends great Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity unto all those that Live by their own Industry, and such as love and favour the Muses, with the Death of some great Personage, Wars, Famine, and Pestilence; of Diseases, the Phrenzy, Lethargy, Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lepsie, and griefs of the Head.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Mars</hi> presageth of Sickly, Contagious, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasant Winds, the drying up of Fountains and Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, Scarcity and Putrefaction of Fruits; much, and often Thunder, Coruscations, and Lightning: The Seas pester'd and troubled more than ordinary with frequent Ship-wracks; of Brawlings, Contentions, Wars, Vexations, Tumults, Seditions, and other Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs. Of Diseases, most cruel Dysenteries (or Bloody-Fluxes) Pestilent Fevers, and Tertian Agues, and Swellings (full of heat and redness) commonly called St. <hi>Anthony</hi>'s Fire, Phrensies, Untimely Births, and hot Sicknesses; the Hemorrhoides (or Piles) Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages, Acute and Chronick Diseases, with others of like Nature. And (saith <hi>Cardan.) habet ut dixi semper hoc praecipuum Cometes à deliquio distinctum ut Martis de</hi> Mercurio <hi>furentium damna significet.</hi> A Comet (as I have told you) hath always this special distinction from an Eclipse, That it signifies losses and hurt to be done by the Outrages of Souldiers and <hi>Mercurialists.</hi> He adds further, <hi>Dissidium &amp; permu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tationem Fulgura, Tonitrua, Terrae Motus, Ventos graves, Saevas tempestates, Novas Artes &amp; Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiones, omnes tamen humano generi perniciosas:</hi> That is, Deceit and Bartering, Thunder and Lightning, Earthquakes, Grievous Winds, Cruel Tempests, New Arts and Inventions, yet those Mischievous to Humane kind.</p>
                        <p>Moreover, the same <hi>Cardan</hi> tells us, (<hi>Seg.</hi> 3. <hi>Aphor.</hi> 117.) <hi>Cometae Mobiles bella indicant ab externis</hi>:
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:49861:104"/>
That movable Comets do proclaim Wars, from, or by means of Foreigners and Strangers. Again (in another place) <hi>Semper videntur, quae contra ordinem Signorum feruntur, mutationes Legum significare.</hi> Those Comets which are moved contrary to the Order of the Signs, are always observed to signifie Change of Laws: And he gives the Reason thereof, <hi>Quod motus is primi Coeli fit, atque ob id à Deo vel supremo Rectore:</hi> Because that motion follows the <hi>Primum Mobile,</hi> and is therefore from God, or other Supream Governour of our Affairs.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Haly Rhadoan</hi> is likewise of Opinion, that a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trograde Comet doth signifie, <hi>Haereses &amp; Legum tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bas, &amp;c.</hi> Heresies and varieties of Laws, than which (saith he) none are crueller, seeing that in all other Evils, Men may know they work Mischiefs, but in the Breaches and Debates of Laws and Heresies, and in Wars that be raised by reason of different Laws; when Men exercise their Cruelty upon Infants and little Children, and kill Men with Torments and Fire; lead away Captives into Bondage, spoil the Fields, and destroy whole Cities with Fire, some think they do God good Service, others play the Hypocrites.</p>
                        <p>And our Learned <hi>Dee, Aphor.</hi> 88. plainly tells us, that <hi>Planeta Retrogradus, &amp;c.</hi> A Retrograde Planet, or Comet, seems after a sort to infringe the constant Order of Nature, in that it finishes its daily Motion in shorter time than doth the Aequator it self.</p>
                        <p>Let us yet hear what <hi>Junctinus</hi> says, <hi>fol.</hi> 318. <hi>Si apparuerit aliqua ex Stellis, Cometis, &amp;c.</hi> If any one Comet (saith he) shall appear in <hi>Gemini,</hi> it fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shews an appearance of Wantonness and Fornication, with a Reverence of Venereal Incests in Men: That Religious Persons, and Men serving God, shall be cast down, and nothing regarded. It shall signifie
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:49861:104"/>
Brawling and Contention, Seed-Plots of War and Sicknesses, whereby shall follow the Death of Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and Young Men especially: Moreover, Abortive-Births, Destruction of Birds, Famine, Thunder, and Coruscations, with strong Winds that shall tear up young Trees by the middle.</p>
                        <p>Again, <hi>Si apparuerit aliqui ex Stellis Cometis in</hi> Tauro, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> If any Comet (saith he) shall appear in <hi>Tau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi> it imports the bad state and condition of Men, that little of good shall befall them, and the Injuries of Rebels, that be in those Regions, or Countries to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them. It is also wont to portend the Death of some Great Man, Captivities, Wrongs, and a Toleration of Unlawful things. Besides, Detriment unto whole Herds and Droves of Cattel, strong Winds, Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Corn and Fruits, very much Cold in its Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, with a horrible Earthquake, Vehement Sicknesses, and dry Diseases, as Scabs and Itches.</p>
                        <p>And thus much of the Quality, or Nature of this Comets Effects.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. The Second thing to be enquired after, are the Places and Persons thereby threatned and endanger'd: For the knowledge whereof, we must consider, (1.) The inclination of the Comets Tail, (or Rays) for look what Regions or Countries the same did respect, and those shall (more or less) be endamaged and hurt by the Effects thereof. This inclined (for the most part) to the North-East Nations of the World: And what they are may be discerned by the Globe or Map, unto which I refer the Reader. (But the places prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally designed to endure its Effects, are the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries Subject to <hi>Gemini</hi> and <hi>Taurus,</hi> through which it moved; and those are (according to <hi>Origanus) Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinia,</hi> part of <hi>Lombardy, Flanders, Brabant,</hi> the Dukedom of <hi>Wittemberge, Hyrcania, Armenia, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riana,
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:49861:105"/>
Cirenaica, Marmarica,</hi> and the lower <hi>Egypt, Russia, Alba,</hi> the Greater <hi>Polonia,</hi> the North of <hi>Swed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> all <hi>Ireland, Lorrain, Campania, Switzerland, Rhetia, Franconia, Parthia, Persia,</hi> and the <hi>Cyclades</hi> Islands which lye between <hi>Europe</hi> and <hi>Asia, Cyprus,</hi> and the Coasts of the Lesser <hi>Asia</hi>;— more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly the Cities of <hi>London, Corduba, Viterbium, Cesena, Turinum, Vercellas, Rhegium, Lovain, Bruges, Mogun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia, Hasford, Bamberge,</hi> and <hi>Noriberge.</hi> Moreover, <hi>Bononia, Senas, Mantua, Tarentum, Parma, Lucerna, Nants, Wirizburge, Carolostadium, Lipsia, Posania, Guesna,</hi> and <hi>Novogardia</hi> (in <hi>Muscovia.</hi>)</p>
                        <p n="3">3. So likewise the Regions unto which this Comet was Vertical: For, (as <hi>Origanus, pag.</hi> 525. <hi>Cometae illis regionibus imprimis nocent; quibus sunt verticales, aut in quarum sunt signis</hi>: Comets (saith he) do espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially hurt those Regions unto which they are Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical, or in whose Signs they happen. And, our Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Country-man, Dr. <hi>Dee,</hi> tells us, <hi>Aphor.</hi> 54. <hi>Quo magis ad perpendicularitatem, &amp;c.</hi> By how much more the Radious Axis of any Star, or Comet, comes nearer being perpendicular to any Elementary Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficies, by so much more powerfully that Star or Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met pours out its Vertues upon the place of its Inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</p>
                        <p>For the specifical Vertues of the Stars, and Comets, being conveyed to us by their Light; the fewer the Beams are that fall upon the Horizon, the less shall be their Vertue, and that fewer Beams fall upon the place of the Horizon, in their Oblique Position, than when they approach nearer to, or are in their Perpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicularity, is evident to every one but meanly Versed in Geometry and the Opticks.</p>
                        <p>Now, what the Regions and Countries be unto which this Comet became Perpendicular, the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:49861:105"/>
Aphorism will determine. <hi>Stella verticales sunt illae quae tantam habent declinationem ab Aequinoctiali, quanta est elevatio Poli illius Regionis</hi>: Stars that be Vertical, are those which have as much Declination from the Equinoctial, as is the Elevation of the Pole, or Latitude of the place. And therefore all the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions, Kingdoms, Common-wealths, Countreys and Towns, that have from 00. degrees, to 16. degrees, 46 minutes of South Latitude; and from 00. degr. to 49°. 9′. of North Latitude, are herein principally concern'd. I'le only instance some few eminent pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces on this side the Equator, the rest you may see in the Globe.</p>

                        <p>Here it may be objected, whether <hi>England</hi> shall not suffer by the Effects of this Comet, as well as other places? To which I answer, That although I find it not Vertical to any part of <hi>England,</hi> yet, I must needs confess, it wanted but a little of being so in the Southern parts thereof, and cannot therefore be exempted from sharing with other places in the Miseries and Calamities threatned them, especially <hi>London,</hi> in whose Ascendant the Comet first appeared. Howbeit, <hi>England</hi> in general shall not suffer by it so extreamly as some Provinces and Cities of <hi>Italy, France, Spain, Portugal,</hi> and other Countreys under whose Ascendant it moved, or to whom it was Vertical.</p>
                        <p>It was a Retrograde Comet in <hi>Gemini</hi> and <hi>Taurus, Anno</hi> 1553. That immediately preceded a great Earthquake and horrible Winds in the Countreys bordering upon the <hi>Rhine.</hi> A Schism in <hi>England,</hi> a

                        <p>In due search whereof we are to consider the Habit of the Comet in respect of the Sun. <hi>Cometa Orien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talis effectum suum citius ostendit; Occidentalis tardius.</hi> An Oriental Comet doth quickly shew its Effects, but an Occidental (as this was) more slowly. And this in the general.— <hi>In Specie</hi> (saith <hi>Cardan) quantum temporis requiritur</hi> Prolemaeus <hi>non dixit. Ptolemy</hi> hath left us no special Rule whereby to know the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise beginning of a Comets Effects.</p>
                        <p>Howbeit, <hi>Cardan</hi> is of Opinion, that the beginnings thereof are (as in Eclipses) deferred so many Months, as there shall be inequal hours intercepted between the Comet and the Ascendant of the Figure erected to the middle time of its appearance: Yet (saith he) <hi>Hoc unum interest quod semina corum quae p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="182" facs="tcp:49861:108"/>
Seeds) of those things which are signified by a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met, are deferred longer: And he gives the Example of our Saviour, at whose Birth there appeared a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met in the East, which the Wise Men saw, and came therefore to Worship him. (They called it a Star, by a common name, as well because Comets are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Stars, as also for that it was most fair and beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and resembling those that usually shine by Night.) Which Star or Comet (saith he) pronounced the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions and Troubles that succeeded by the Promulga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Faith of Christ; These many Exiles and Martyrs, and afterwards the Kingdom of Peace and Salvation to be established: The Author and King of which [CHRIST] was born in the very Glory of the Comet, because it appeared in the East.</p>
                        <p>Nevertheless, the Effects thereof, that is to say, the Preaching and Promulgation of his Law, the Sediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Tumults of the People, the Persecutions, Banishments, Deaths, Wars, and Kingdoms erected in a Christian Name, scarce had their Commencement Thirty Years after, and persevere until this very day.</p>
                        <p>So on the contrary, in 1264. there appeared an unhappy Comet in the East, extending its Hairs or Rays (if we Credit the Story) to the Mid-heaven; which Comet continued almost Nine Months toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="183" facs="tcp:49861:108"/>
third Year after the Comet, <hi>Banducar,</hi> (or rather <hi>Bandoduchar</hi>) King of <hi>Babylon</hi> and <hi>Assyria,</hi> inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded <hi>Armenia</hi> with a mighty Army, Conquered <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch,</hi> and committed most grievous slaughters upon the Christians.</p>
                        <p>In the fourth Year after the Comet, <hi>Conradinus</hi> (the <hi>Suevian</hi>) being Vanquished and taken Captive by <hi>Charles,</hi> Earl of <hi>Provence</hi> and <hi>Sicily</hi>; and (as <hi>Aemilius</hi> writes) the declared King of <hi>Jerusalem</hi> was Beheaded.</p>
                        <p>In the fifth Year, <hi>Lewis</hi> the Ninth, King of <hi>France,</hi> passing into <hi>Africa,</hi> was taken at <hi>Carthage</hi>; or, as others say, at <hi>Tunera,</hi> and dyed of a Flux, the greatest part of his Army being first destroyed by Famine and Pestilence: Whose Death was no sooner heard of, than the aforesaid <hi>Charles</hi> enforced the King of the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaginians</hi> to a Yearly Tribute.</p>
                        <p>In the Sixth Year, the <hi>Scythians</hi> (now called <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars</hi>) assisting the <hi>Armenians,</hi> (the <hi>Assyrians</hi> or <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racens</hi> being Vanquished and fled) freed <hi>Asia,</hi> and long kept it by the consent of the Christians. So that the measure of time limiting the beginning and ending of a Comets Effects cannot be prefixed, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less, as <hi>Ptolemy</hi> describeth; for so indeed they may be conjectured: But to adventure on feigned propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of time, where none is in Nature, were ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous.</p>

                           <pb n="184" facs="tcp:49861:109"/>This Comet continued twenty three days, or thereabouts; and 'tis probable the Effects may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue as many Years; but I dare not conclude so.

                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1. FIrst, to Collect from the Histories of several Nations of the World, the most Eminent and Notable Changes that have therein happened, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of Sects, Empires, Kingdoms, Wars, Famines, Deluges, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> with the exact times of their Changes,
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:49861:109"/>
and the true postures of the Constellations and Planets preceding the same.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. To observe the Changes of the Air, in respect of Heat, Cold, Moisture, and Drought; as also the Winds throughout the whole Latitude of the Earth: And then the different places of Longitude, in their Natures and Qualities, at the same and at several times, Erecting Coelestial Figures most congruous for that purpose; and to mark well how from thence, Plants, Brutes, and Men are affected, and all these Observations to compare one with another.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. To erect the several Nativities of such as dyed not long after they were Born; of those that be Sickly, or any ways Hurt, Blind, Lame, Ulcerated, Wounded, Burnt, Mutilated, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> diligently observing the Parts so affected; the which may most conveniently be done in a spacious City, (such as <hi>Paris</hi> is) where are many Hospitals, and Poor People innumerable, many Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgeons, and every day various Casualties.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. By help of the Physicians, to find out (if pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible) the Beginnings, Species, Accidents, and Solu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of all Acute and daily Diseases, that every where abound, Erecting Coelestial Schemes to those Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings: And that especially at <hi>Paris,</hi> where the exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitant Practice of frequent Blood-letting, does much disturb Natures Motions and Crises in Diseases, and very often elude and frustrate the Astrological Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions of the Ancients concerning them.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. What the Ancient Astrologers have delivered on every Subject, the same to Collect and Observe in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral, by diligent reading thereof, and to Correct the Figures of their Experiments, in respect of the Errors of the old Astronomy.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. To Argue and Determine by Physical and Astro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logical Reasons, concerning the System of the World,
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:49861:110"/>
now so much controverted, betwixt the <hi>Copernicans</hi> and <hi>Tychonists:</hi> For as much as in this thing (although both Mensurable and Visible) Geometry and the Sight are both defective: Neither can the quickest sighted Man living conclude any thing thence for certain, with what Telescope soever: Because the same <hi>Phaenomena</hi> are deduced from both the Systems. For, albeit the thing it self be sensible, yet does it elude and surpass the sense of Man: the truth whereof so much concerns Astrology, that <hi>Tycho</hi> and <hi>Kepler</hi> thought fit rather to destroy her, than that their own new Systems should not be established.</p>
                     <p>Afterwards, out of the confused sayings of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Astrologers, and the Observations of past and present things, with the proper and Corrected Schemes of Heaven, by accurate Speculation, and dividing rightly, to attain unto the first Causes of Effects, which are the first Principles of this Science, few in number both in this and other Sciences, yet so valid, that from thence (they being firmly established) the whole Science of Astrology, and her innumerable Conclusions, may easily be drawn to a Method. Whence I dare boldly affirm, that Astrology (which is partly a Physical, partly a Mathematical Science) may be more certainly and evidently demonstrated; yea, and in a more Excellent Method, than either Natural Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy, or Physick have hitherto been, by any Man whatsoever.</p>
                     <p>Yet, seeing many times for the restoring of Astro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy, and once in the Kalendar, many Men (Learned in these Arts) have met together at the Charge of Kings, Emperours, and of his Holyness the Pope, no Man (I suppose) will imagine, that one Man's Life or Labour can suffice for the above-mentioned work, it being so very great, so difficult and sublime, but
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:49861:110"/>
that every one of the Articles require several Persons proper thereunto, and to be encouraged with fair and liberal Allowances. All whose Labours, he who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing endowed with Understanding and Wisdom, is made Praefect or Ruler of the Sixth Article, must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive and Govern, that thence he may know how to discharge his Duty.</p>
                     <p>But 'tis much to be fear'd, this Malignant, and [to Scholars] most Ingrateful Age (the so long wish'd for and present Opportunity being slighted) will ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther defraud it self and Posterity of so great a Benefit, or else retard the same for some more Myriads of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Revolutions, or at least-wise scorn to see it now compleat and perfect: When verily this Science is more Divine than all other Natural Sciences; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit, through the want of Demonstration, and Abuse, it hath hitherto undergone the Contempt and Hatred of Ignorant Men.</p>
                     <p>But let no Man think I enforce or attempt any thing against the most Holy <hi>Roman</hi> Church: For, I embrace not only the Ninth Rule of the Index of Books pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited by the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> but also the Bull of <hi>Sixtus Quintus,</hi> against such as profess the vain and false Science of the Stars and Constellations, which I extreamly abhor, and endeavour with all my might utterly to extirpate.</p>
                     <p>Moreover, I deny not, but that the very true Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the Stars (which what sober Man will deny, if with a Mind elevated above the dregs of the Earth, and the Clouds of the Air, he fix his Eye upon those truly sublime, but yet Naturally known Powers of the Coelestial Bodies, and their manner of Operation?) may no less Lawfully be forbidden by the Church, in respect of the Abuse thereof, than the Reading of the Holy Scriptures, according to that of St. <hi>Matthew,
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:49861:111"/>
Cap.</hi> 18. <hi>If thy Hand or Foot offend thee, cut it off and cast it from thee</hi>: It is good for thee, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>However, from those Excellent Principles of Astro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy (newly discovered) it may be Lawful (at least) to assure you, that I can so strongly assert the truth thereof, it shall abundantly appear to all Men, that as it is a Holy and Godly thing to inveigh against all Diabolical Practisers, Vain, Ignorant, and Supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Astrologers, and to deter Men from all vain and sinful Curiosity; so, to rage and rave against the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of this true Science, whether in Pamphlets or Pulpits, is, in an Ignorant Man unjust and rash, in a knowing Man very Malicious; and that indeed it were far better for Men (even in order to their Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation) that the Truth and true Use of this Science might be known, than the Falsity, Ignorance, and Abuse thereof should any longer continue, and GOD be defrauded of that Glory, which is by right due to him for his Creating the Heavens.</p>
                     <p>Neither let it trouble any Man, that I pronounce <hi>Sixtus ab Heminga,</hi> (whom the Enemies of Judiciary Astrology so much Glory in) to be a very Ignorant Fellow: When I can easily make it appear by Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riments and solid Reason too, that both <hi>Cardan,</hi> and <hi>Ptolemy</hi> himself, being too much addicted to Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal Causes, (not well weighing particular) did lead Posterity into no finall Errors: But if the Blind lead the Blind, what Wonder is it, if they both fall into the Ditch? In the mean time I must Humbly intreat those Rare and Renowned Masters of this Science, if they have gotten or observed any thing in it that is Excellent, they would vouchsafe ingeniously to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part it to me.</p>
                     <p>Thus far <hi>Morinus,</hi> and enough (I suppose) to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie any Reasonable Man, that Astrology is demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strable;
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:49861:111" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and not only Lawful and True, but Divinely Excellent, and necessary for a Christian: And that none but the Ignorant and Malicious will condemn or oppose the same.</p>

Which supposed so, (as indeed it is by the most Learned of this Age) yet in this doth the <hi>Starry Heaven</hi> perform the Office of the <hi>First Moveable,</hi> [That the same part of the <hi>Earth,</hi> by the motion of the whole body thereof, continually cometh into the Aspect of New parts of the <hi>Stellified Heaven,</hi> whereby that part of the <hi>Earth</hi> shall be forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with changed <hi>de novo,</hi> unless we deny it all power of Operating thereupon.]</p>
                     <p>Whether therefore there be no other <hi>Heavens</hi> above that of the <hi>Fixed Stars</hi> (unknown I confess, to the <hi>Aegyptians, Chaldaeans, Plato, Aristotle, Hyparchus,</hi> and even to <hi>Ptolomy</hi> himself.) Or whether <hi>More,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the <hi>Alphonsins</hi>; yet this is most certain, and not contradicted by any, That in Mundane Bodies, as the <hi>Earth, Water, Air, Fire,</hi> and <hi>Heavens,</hi> there is some First and Supream, than which there cannot be any higher; otherwise should they be infinite in Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration: And also that these very Bodies are the univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal <hi>Causes</hi> of <hi>Physical</hi> Mutations, and subordinate one to another in Operation: Therefore in that <hi>Subordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> there must likewise be one first and supream <hi>Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sical</hi> cause, which acteth by it self, and borroweth not of any former the power of Operation. And from that the <hi>Middle,</hi> and from these the <hi>Lowest</hi> do receive their vertue of Action: Otherwise, this <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordination</hi> of <hi>Causes</hi> should it self be quite overthrown: For, why should the <hi>Middle</hi> be said to be <hi>Subordinate</hi> to the <hi>Supream,</hi> and the <hi>Lowest</hi> to the <hi>Middle</hi> in their Operation, if that which is lower received no influx or vertue from that which is Superiour unto it? And can the <hi>Lowest</hi> without the Influence of the <hi>Middle,</hi> or these without the Influence of the <hi>Highest,</hi> of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves produce any Effect?</p>

                        <pb n="191" facs="tcp:49861:112"/>The <hi>First Cause,</hi> therefore, of all things can be no other than the <hi>Supream Heaven,</hi> which if (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Doctrine of the Ancients) it move, it moveth also the Bodies that be thereunto inferiour, yet is not it self moved by any other Body superiour unto it. And if (according to <hi>Kepler</hi>) it be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveable, and indued with <hi>Stars,</hi> it hath influence, at least, upon the Bodies that be subordinate to it, but receiveth not influence from any other. Therefore either way, the <hi>First Heaven</hi> shall be the <hi>First Cause,</hi> or the first <hi>Physical</hi> beginning of <hi>Physical Effects</hi> and <hi>Changes.</hi> For, 'tis but expedient that the <hi>First begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning</hi> in every kind, should be the most perfect: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore shall the <hi>First Heaven</hi> be in the Lineage of <hi>Effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Causes,</hi> which are of the most universal and powerful Active vertue, (which is the greatest per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of an <hi>Efficient Cause</hi>) so that there is no <hi>Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour Corporeal Cause,</hi> which it moveth not, or into which it instilleth not a vertue or power of Operation; and nothing anew generated in the whole World, which this vertue of it self toucheth not.</p>
                     <p>Which being granted, how can any Man doubt, but that every thing which is generated and born <hi>de novo,</hi> should be referred to that <hi>First Cause</hi> thereof? For, it must be referred either to some <hi>part</hi> of that <hi>Heaven,</hi> or to that <hi>whole Heaven:</hi> But it ought to be referred to the whole Heaven: For, the <hi>First heaven</hi> is not the <hi>First</hi> and most <hi>Universal Cause, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundum aliquam sui partem,</hi> according to some part of it, but <hi>secundum se totum,</hi> according to the entire Body thereof: Therefore every <hi>Sublunary</hi> Effect, so far as it may be considered <hi>secundum se totum,</hi> to wit, in its <hi>Beginning, Vigour, Declination,</hi> and <hi>Destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,</hi> must be referred to the <hi>whole heaven</hi>; yet not confusedly, but distinctly and orderly, as the most
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:49861:113"/>
orderly motion of <hi>Heaven</hi> it self requireth.</p>
                     <p>For, as the <hi>whole Effect,</hi> and whatsoever doth hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen from <hi>Heaven</hi> during the same, correspond to the <hi>whole Heaven,</hi> and yet the <hi>Beginning</hi> is not the <hi>End</hi> thereof; so what was in <hi>Heaven</hi> of it self the <hi>Cause</hi> of its <hi>Beginning,</hi> this same thing shall not of it self be the <hi>Cause</hi> of the <hi>End</hi> thereof: (for so no Effect should continue, nor indeed any be produced.) But as the <hi>Beginning, Vigour, Declination,</hi> and <hi>End</hi> of things do differ and succeed one another: So the <hi>Coe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestial Causes</hi> of these likewise differ amongst them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and must succeed one another. But in <hi>Heaven, Difference</hi> and <hi>Succession</hi> are not, unless in respect of the <hi>parts</hi> thereof. Therefore in <hi>Heaven</hi> are certain <hi>parts</hi> that be the <hi>Causes</hi> of the <hi>beginning</hi> of things, or which do govern the same: Others <hi>succedent</hi> to those, which rule the <hi>Vigour</hi>; others that rule their <hi>Declina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>; and lastly, such as govern the <hi>End</hi> or <hi>Destruction</hi> of things.</p>
                     <p>What part of <hi>Heaven</hi> then (<hi>Nature</hi> her self guid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and teaching us) shall we call the <hi>First Cause</hi> of the Natural <hi>Beginning</hi> of every thing? Surely that, which in the very <hi>Beginning</hi> of the thing, <hi>ariseth</hi> above the <hi>Horizon</hi> thereof, and <hi>arising</hi> causeth the thing it self also to <hi>arise.</hi> For, certain it is, that of all the places of <hi>Heaven,</hi> the <hi>East</hi> is more powerful than the rest, as is testified by all <hi>Astrologers,</hi> concerning the <hi>Rising, Culminating,</hi> and <hi>Setting</hi> of the <hi>Stars</hi>; and as Experience it self convinceth, in the Change of <hi>Air.</hi> But a <hi>Cause</hi> is said to be onely more Powerful, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of a stronger, and more difficult Effect: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, the stronger and more difficult Effect of things, must be attributed to the <hi>Ascendant Part</hi> of <hi>Heaven,</hi> which none will deny to be the <hi>Rise</hi> or <hi>Production</hi> of those things. But successively, that <hi>Part</hi> of <hi>Heaven,</hi>
                        <pb n="193" facs="tcp:49861:113"/>
which is more elevated above the <hi>Horizon,</hi> and pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sesseth the <hi>Mid-heauen,</hi> in the <hi>Rise</hi> or <hi>Beginning</hi> of the thing, shall have the Government of the <hi>vigour</hi> and <hi>Operative vertue</hi> thereof; That which <hi>setteth</hi> at the same time, the <hi>Declination</hi> of it, from its perfect estate: And lastly, That which obtains the <hi>Bottom</hi> of <hi>Heaven,</hi> shall be taken for the <hi>Cause</hi> of its <hi>Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And this is the simple, and (of all others) the first <hi>Division</hi> of <hi>Heaven,</hi> whereby it is truly and rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onally fitted for the <hi>Begetting, Increase,</hi> and <hi>Alteration</hi> of all <hi>Physical</hi> things from their own Nature, and, at length, <hi>corrupting</hi> them: And which onely the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient <hi>Astrologers</hi> frequently used, in their General and Particular constitutions of Heaven, as appears by <hi>Holy,</hi> in the <hi>Figure</hi> of the <hi>Comet</hi> which happened in his time: For that either a more scrupulous <hi>Division</hi> of <hi>Heaven</hi> was harder in those days for want of <hi>Astro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomical Tables</hi>: Or because this <hi>Division</hi> might gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rically contain, whatsoever another could more spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially.</p>
                     <p>But when once some <hi>Astrologer</hi> had observed, that <hi>Heaven</hi> was both made and moved, rather for the sake of <hi>Man,</hi> than any other <hi>Animate,</hi> or <hi>Inanimate Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi> and how many things agreed to <hi>Man</hi> himself, in respect of his more <hi>Divine Nature,</hi> which did not in any wise to more ignoble Creatures: He supposed, that for <hi>Man</hi>'s own sake also the whole <hi>Circle</hi> of <hi>Heaven</hi> was rationally <hi>Divided</hi> into <hi>Twelve parts,</hi> (by great <hi>Circles</hi> drawn through the intersections of the <hi>Horizon</hi> and <hi>Meridian,</hi> and cutting the <hi>Aequator</hi> in so many equal parts) which he called <hi>Houses</hi>; the first whereof he placed in the <hi>East,</hi> and delivered to Posterity, That it governed the <hi>Life</hi> of <hi>Man,</hi> and from thence might be had and drawn a conjectural

<pb n="205" facs="tcp:49861:119"/>
abundantly satisfie as well the <hi>Friends</hi> as <hi>Enemies</hi> of <hi>Astrology,</hi> if from the Doctrine proposed, I do give a full and clear <hi>Answer</hi> to the beforementioned im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunate <hi>Questions,</hi> put to Astrologers, concerning these houses.</p>
                     <p>Therefore to the first <hi>Question</hi> I say, that <hi>heaven</hi> is divided into 12 Houses and no more; because every one of the 4 <hi>Cardinal parts</hi> of <hi>heaven,</hi> which govern the <hi>beginning, vigour, Declination</hi> and <hi>Death</hi> of things, do by a <hi>Trine Aspect,</hi> behold two other <hi>Caelestial parts,</hi> which be of its own <hi>Nature:</hi> whence shall arise three places out of each of the 4. <hi>Cardinal,</hi> of the same nature; for three times 4. doth make nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther more nor less than 12.</p>
                     <p>To the second, I say, that the first House is called the House of <hi>Life,</hi> because a <hi>man</hi> is said first to <hi>Rise</hi> upon this <hi>Scene</hi> of the world, when first he draws the <hi>Breath</hi> of this <hi>Life</hi>: and therefore seeing that the first breathing of this <hi>Life</hi> is the beginning thereof, it must be placed in the <hi>East,</hi> as the beginning of every other <hi>Physical</hi> thing.</p>
                     <p>To the third, I answer, that it matters not as to the instituting of <hi>Caelestial Influxes,</hi> or Praedictions, what number any House be called by, whether 2.3. or 4. provided <hi>heaven</hi> be divided (as before) into <hi>four Triplicities,</hi> and the nature of the Houses not changed. Yet the <hi>Physical</hi> order of the Houses is from the <hi>East</hi> to the <hi>South,</hi> into the <hi>West,</hi> agreeable to the Motion of the first and most universal <hi>Physical cause,</hi> according to whose parts succeeding one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, by that motion, are the principal <hi>Estates</hi> or <hi>Ages</hi> of all generable things contained (according to their succession, before related) in the <hi>Equator</hi> the principal <hi>Circle</hi> of the first cause: and so <hi>Physically</hi> the House of <hi>Enemies</hi> is the second in order; the
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:49861:120"/>
House of <hi>Friends,</hi> the third, the House of <hi>Magistracy,</hi> the fourth, and so forth. But <hi>mystically,</hi> or <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logically,</hi> the Numerical order begins from the <hi>East</hi> by the <hi>North Angle,</hi> to the <hi>West:</hi> the reason where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is this. There are two Motions in the <hi>heavens</hi>; the first is of the first Moveable, termed the <hi>Rapt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion</hi>: the second of the <hi>Planets,</hi> who (notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing the <hi>Rapt-motion,</hi> by which they are wheel'd about) inviolably observe the Laws of their own Moderate motion, ordained to the contrary of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer. There are also two Motions in <hi>Man,</hi> who is called the <hi>Microcosine</hi>; one of the <hi>sensitive Appetite,</hi> which is the Motion of <hi>man,</hi> in as much as he is a <hi>Living creature,</hi> and the first in the order of nature, and also <hi>rapid</hi>: the other is of the Rational appetite, which is the Motion of a <hi>man,</hi> as he is <hi>man,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the former, and also very moderate in it self. But forasmuch as the first of these Motions of a <hi>man,</hi> hath a greater <hi>Analogy</hi> with the Motion of the first moveable; and the second with the Motion of the <hi>Planets</hi>: Therefore was it thought sit that <hi>heaven</hi> should be divided according to the <hi>Succession</hi> of the <hi>Signs,</hi> or the direct Motion of the <hi>Planets</hi> (for these also are sometime <hi>Retrograde,</hi> and <hi>Stationary,</hi> even as is the Rational appetite, in its course, whilst it suffers it self to be <hi>rapt</hi> or perverted by the <hi>Sensitive Appetite.</hi>) But that was done only in an <hi>Analogical</hi> consideration, and not for any <hi>Physical</hi> cause, as if the Motion of the first Moveable should by it self have influence upon the <hi>Sensitive Appetite</hi> of <hi>man,</hi> and the Motion of the <hi>Planets,</hi> by it self, upon the Rational: for the Planets insomuch as they are carryed by their own Motion, and even also the first moveable, have not of themselves any influence upon the <hi>Sensitive Appetite,</hi> or on <hi>man,</hi> as he is a <hi>Living creature,</hi> other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:49861:120"/>
than upon other <hi>Animals.</hi> But neither the <hi>Planets,</hi> nor First Moveable, have of themselves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence upon the Rational appetite, or <hi>man,</hi> so <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>YOU have here (at the request of some <hi>Honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Personages) an Astrological Judgment</hi> upon the future Successes of His <hi>Majesties</hi> present <hi>March,</hi> begun the seventh of <hi>May</hi> instant. It is delivered in <hi>General</hi> Terms; for I neither will nor dare descend to <hi>Particulars;</hi> that would require the knowledge of many things, besides His <hi>Majesties Nativity,</hi> which I may not presume to meddle with; it being in it self both unlawful and very dangerous to publish any thing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the particular Fortunes and Destinies of <hi>Princes.</hi> For this <hi>Thrasybulus, Ascletarion,</hi> and <hi>Gauricus</hi> were much to blame; the first whereof fore-told the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of <hi>Tiberius</hi> the <hi>Emperour;</hi> the second, of <hi>Domitian;</hi> the third, of <hi>Bentivola</hi> in <hi>Bononia</hi>: So likewise the <hi>Priest</hi> that caused the Rumour of the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture <hi>Murthering</hi> of <hi>Galeacius Sfortia, Duke</hi> of <hi>Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain,</hi> who were all of them worthily rewarded for their Folly. And so ought Master <hi>Lilly</hi> and Master <hi>Booker</hi> to be for their pernicious Pamphlets, wherein their sole endeavour hath hitherto been by most disloyal and am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biguous Phrases to animate and hasten on the <hi>Rebels</hi> and other <hi>Conspirators</hi> to plot and attempt <hi>Mischief</hi> against His <hi>Majesty;</hi> whereas an honest and discreet Artist ought not to divulge any thing, (especially of <hi>Princes</hi>) that may any way tend to endanger their Persons, but either not to meddle at all, or else to deal
<pb facs="tcp:49861:123"/>
privately with the <hi>Prince</hi> himself; and then also to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here to <hi>Cardans</hi> Rules in his Book <hi>De Astrologicis In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terogationibus:</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>But neither <hi>Cardan</hi> (notwithstanding he was a man of extraordinary cr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And yet if in this respect or any other the Art happen to be abused by some <hi>Spurii (non veri filii) Artis,</hi> it hath but the same fortune that other Arts and Sciences have: And the Lawyers Rule is, That <hi>abusus non tollit usum.</hi> The bounds of which limitation I presume I have not any way exceeded in this Discourse; which be pleased to accept as followeth.</p>

                  <head>An Astrological Judgment upon His MAJESTIES March.</head>
                  <p>BY this distribution the <hi>Fortitudes</hi> and <hi>Debilities</hi> of every Planet in the precedent Coelestial Scheme are easily gathered: It follows then that we likewise confer them among themselves according to the respective numbers of their <hi>Fortitudes</hi> and <hi>Debi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities</hi>; that it may yet more manifestly appear, which of them are most strong and fortunate, which most weak and infortunate, and accordingly how they suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed one another in strength and power.</p>
                  <p>First then, the Planet <hi>Mercury</hi> of all the rest is simply most strong and fortunate in the Scheme. For if the number of his <hi>Debilities</hi> be deducted from the sum of his Fortitudes, there still remaineth 22. Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of strength, which no other Planet obtaineth in the Figure.</p>
                  <p>The next in dignity is <hi>Venus,</hi> who hath 17 Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies; then <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Jupiter,</hi> who are both very powerful; the first of them being endued with 13, the latter with 10 <hi>Dignities: Mars</hi> and the <hi>Sun</hi> are both but weak in respect of their <hi>Essential Dignities</hi>; yet for some Circumstances very considerable in this case, the <hi>Sun</hi> may be said to be the stronger, which being generally taken, is a good and laudable token.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="216" facs="tcp:49861:125"/>The <hi>Moon</hi> of all others is the most debilitated, her <hi>Detriments</hi> exceeding her <hi>Fortitudes</hi> by 8, which will prove very advantagious to His Majesty, as hereafter shall be noted. And thus much generally touching the Constitution of the Planets in the Figure.</p>
                  <p>Now to descend more particularly to the present m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>tter: We are (in this case) principally to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der four things.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>First,</hi> the <hi>Ascendant</hi> of the <hi>Scheme,</hi> which is the <hi>Significator</hi> of the <hi>City</hi> from whence His <hi>Majesty</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan his March: From which House we are to collect the condition and state of this City during His <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties</hi> absence.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the 10 <hi>House,</hi> which (according to <hi>Haly</hi>) is the <hi>Significatrix</hi> of the Journey: And from this we are to deduce our judgment of His <hi>Majesties</hi> Success during the time of his March.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Third</hi> thing to be considered is the 7 <hi>House,</hi> by which we are to judge how His Majesty is likely to be received in those parts where his Army shall pass, and of his Success against the Enemy.</p>
                  <p>And <hi>lastly,</hi> the <hi>fourth House</hi>; whereby we are to inform our selves of His <hi>Majesties</hi> Success in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn.</p>

their future <hi>Opposition;</hi> (with a touch concerning the next <hi>Conjunction,</hi> which will happen in the Sign <hi>Gemini,</hi> (the Ascendant of <hi>London)</hi> which will be far more terrible, and of greater concernment to <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> and other parts of this Kingdom, than the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction</hi> in <hi>Taurus</hi> can be to <hi>Ireland</hi>: I have palpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly unmasked his malice, discovered his ignorance, divulged and corrected his Errors, and misapplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Effects of this Coelestial meeting: If his immodest Language, hath any where incited me to too much freedom of speech; I shall crave his excuse, when he beggs my Pardon, for his former Insolencies: I hate not his (or any mans) person, but his Sin. The method is Rough cast, (like my self) if the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter be better polished, I care not: I know, I shall not please all (neither would I) some for want of Judgment, and come for want of Love, and others for lack of Loyalty will condemn me, but none of these do I regard: It is to the Impartial, and juditious I appeal, and to their judgment (only) will I submit. And if they please to adventure but their Patience, as I have done my Pains, (which is not a little) I doubt not of the issue: I have no ungodly ends, in this or any other of my writings, my Wishes are full as good, as <hi>John Bookers</hi>: I wish all happiness to the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Queens Majesty,</hi> and the <hi>Royal Progeny,</hi> and an end to the Miseries of this languishing Kingdom. I love, and wish for the <hi>Book</hi> of <hi>Common-Prayer</hi> again, that was Sealed with the Blood of so many <hi>Martyrs,</hi> till which be, I expect not to see Religion in its purity. I delight not in <hi>War,</hi> nor can I pray for an unjust or Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honourable Peace.</p>

<pb n="228" facs="tcp:49861:131"/>
I have assumed a liberty of publishing this following Discourse, which is void of all Envy, Malice or Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality, but freely, modestly, and sincerely, relating whatsoever concerns this <hi>Coelestial Meeting,</hi> accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Rules of Art, and the Judgment of the most approved Astrologers, Ancient and Modern: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the judicious and indifferent Readers may plainly and orderly perceive the Ignorance and Malice of this trifling Parasite: And rightly understand the Nature and Quality of the Effects of this <hi>Coelestial Congress,</hi> when they shall begin to operate, how long continue, what Nations, or Countries are therein principally concerned, and how far the Kingdom of <hi>Ireland</hi> in particular; concluding, whether or no, that (so long) oppressed Kingdom, be ordained for the stage, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on such Bloody-minded Hell-hounds (as himself) are to perpetrate their Cruelty.</p>
                  <p>I will not trouble the Judicious Reader with any Examples of such Events, as have formerly happened in <hi>England</hi> or elsewhere, upon the like Conjunctions: For that I acknowledge him to have Collected in part.</p>
                  <p>But I will first examine the Foundation whereupon he hath raised this so deformed a Structure, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly proceed, either by adhering to him where he hath stumbled on any truth, or in dissenting from, and Correcting him, where I meet with his Mistakes, Ignorance, and Malice.</p>
                  <p>And first, I will Artificially erect the <hi>Figure</hi> of Heaven, according to the Doctrine of <hi>Regiomonta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> to the <hi>true,</hi> or <hi>apparent</hi> time of this <hi>Conjunction,</hi> and afterwards compare it with that which <hi>Booker</hi> hath published (for I dare not take this (or any other) upon trust either from him or Mr. <hi>Lilly</hi>) whereby, I shall presume, not only to discover his want of skill
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:49861:131"/>
in this ordinary piece of <hi>Astronomy,</hi> but likewise to benefit some others as Ignorant as himself, (if any such can be) who desire to learn the exact manner of erecting the <hi>Figure</hi> of Heaven (by this one Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple) for any moment of time, out of the <hi>Tables</hi> of <hi>Directions.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>First then, we are to enquire, at what time these two Planets are conjoyned. I perceive that <hi>Booker</hi> hath endeavoured to follow <hi>Eichstadius,</hi> and so shall I do (his Tables being the most exact of any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant.)</p>

Do you not blush to see your Ignorance, your Errors, your Impudence, your Malice, thus palpably discovered?

Will any man of understanding think you fit to Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnosticate the effects of the <hi>Planets</hi> and <hi>Stars,</hi> who are not of your selves able to Calculate their true Places, Motions, and Aspects; but are forced to take them upon trust from others?

                        <q>Having intreated my loving Friend, Mr. <hi>Matthew Fiske,</hi> to give me the true <hi>Scheme</hi> of the great <hi>Conjunction</hi> of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Jupiter</hi> in 1603. (for it was so) he gave me the positure afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said (exactly done) by the <hi>Rodolphine Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,</hi> &amp;c.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>And Page 76. of the same Book;</p>
                     <p>
                        <q>I conceive it possible, and do believe I have the <hi>Conjunction</hi> of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Jupiter</hi> in 1642/3;. ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisitely done by the same Learned hand; and that either he, or any as able as himself, may compass the true moment of any <hi>Conjunction.</hi>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>This is a modest and ingenuous acknowledgment of Mr. <hi>Lilly</hi>'s want of skill in <hi>Astronomy,</hi> for you see, he was fain to be beholden to Mr. <hi>Fiske</hi> for Calculating the <hi>Conjunctions</hi> of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Jupiter</hi> in 1603. and 1642/3. or else he knew not where to have had them: And he confesses that he doth but <hi>believe</hi> the last of them to be exquisitely done: He cannot tell how to determine whether it be so or not, of his own know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</p>
                     <p>And by this I see, 'tis no wonder, that Mr. <hi>Lilly</hi> should mistake so grosly of late in all the <hi>Schemes</hi> which he hath published; having lost no less than his
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:49861:137"/>
right hand with the death of Mr. <hi>Fiske</hi>: Since which, he hath done all things sinisterly, and Annually per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plext us with a hotch-potch of his own left-handed-work, to his perpetual shame, and the discredit of better-handed Artists, in this curious knowledge.</p>
                     <p>Far be it from me to conceive otherwise, but that Mr. <hi>Matthew Fiske</hi> (whose memory I honour) was a most excellent Artist, (for the Gent. I have been with several times, and conversed with him before these unhappy differences were) and I am able (though Mr. <hi>Lilly</hi> be not) to Calculate the <hi>Motions</hi> of the <hi>Rudolphine</hi> (or any other) Tables, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore am confident (I had said sure if I would have taken the pains) that he hath Calculated the places of the Planets truly, (if Mr. <hi>Lilly</hi> have so Printed them:) But I believe Mr. <hi>Fiske</hi> left the setting of the Figure to Mr. <hi>Lilly:</hi> For I am very sure the latter of them is very <hi>erroneous,</hi> as will appear to every man that will take the pains to examine the Cuspes of each House according to the time set down: For examine it but thus far.</p>

                     <p>Which is the true degree and minute ascending at that time, so that Mr. <hi>Lilly</hi> hath likewise mistaken eight minutes in the Cuspes of the first and fourth Houses.</p>
                     <p>And yet for all this, I will not blame Mr. <hi>Lilly</hi> so much as this Ignorant Puppy <hi>Booker</hi>; because he freely confesses his own insufficiency, and to whom he was beholden for his helps: Whereas this Impudent Clown will neither acknowledge, nor amend his Errors, not make use of any Learned Artist to rectifie and assist him. And this is the right way, to continue in the wrong,— march on <hi>Jack</hi>—</p>
                     <p>But why do I discourage the poor Snap, for alas! If he should not be doing something (though to ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver so little purpose) he would quickly be undone; for, writing of un-Sainted Almanacks, and Figure-casting, for stoln Goods, and such like Questions, is all the Trade he hath to live by; wherein commonly his judgment is as certain as his Figures are true: Yet thus much I could willingly allow the silly Fellow, would he but forbear thus frequently, and ridiculously to befool himself in Print: I will not deny, but that many things of that Nature may be performed by Astrology, with an able Artist: But far be it from me to be so idle, as to think such things can be possibly done by <hi>Jack Booker.</hi> I my self have had experience of many. <hi>Queries</hi> of this nature, which I have answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed (at the request of some particular Friends) to my own and the <hi>Querents</hi> admiration: But I ever abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red (like him) to make a Profession and Living of it: Indeed, for <hi>Nativities</hi> (wherein I have been most conversant) I commonly followed <hi>Cardanus</hi> his Rule;
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:49861:138"/>
I never wrought without a Reward, <hi>Non sine pretio, nec cum exiguo pretio</hi>: And I condemn any knowing man that doth otherwise; for he that truly labours in the tediousness of a <hi>Nativity,</hi> deserves no small Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward: And whosoever bargains with the Artist, (like a Niggard) defaces his own stamp: It is none of the least Blessings bestowed upon man (by the Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God) that he may be fore-warned of a mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief impending: In that he hath the benefit of time offered him, wherein he may possibly divert, or at least-wise mitigate any evil, or otherwise with joy and thankfulness expect and receive any Blessing portend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Planets and Stars.</p>
                     <p>But it is a Curse to run blind-fold and headlong into any mischance or misery, being neither sensible or mindful thereof. I pity those Cowards, who (like some that use to wink when they fight) are afraid to fore-see any evil of themselves, as though their ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science (or non-visibility) of the evil, were sufficient to divert, or secure them from the danger.</p>
                     <p>But I have deviated too far from the matter I intend, being first to handle the effects of this <hi>Conjunction,</hi> and therein to shew <hi>John Booker</hi> his Errors, and the World his (and Mr. <hi>Lilly</hi>'s) unparalleld Malice; to which limit I shall now confine my self with all candour and impartiality.</p>
                     <p>This <hi>Conjunction</hi> (whereof we are now to treat) falls out in the 14 deg. and 27 min. of <hi>Taurus</hi> (as you may see by the Scheme) the first Sign of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Quadrangle of the Zodiack; a <hi>Cold</hi> and <hi>Dry, Melancholy, Feminine,</hi> and <hi>Meridional</hi> Sign; which is within 5 degrees opposite to that point of <hi>Scorpio,</hi> wherein the <hi>Comet</hi> that appeared <hi>Anno</hi> 1618. was first observed.</p>

The <hi>Moon</hi> is very infortunate, and the <hi>Sun</hi> is the weakest in the Figure, being out of all his <hi>Essential Dignities,</hi> slow in motion, and in the terms of <hi>Mars,</hi> having no other considerable Testimony of strength but only his accidental position in the <hi>West Angle.</hi>

                        <p>Thus much being rightly known and understood, it will be no difficult matter to fore-see, what (in all probability) may be the Natural quality of the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of this Conjunction, if we stick but close to the known Rules of Art, (whence both Mr. <hi>Lilly</hi> and <hi>Booker</hi> do ordinarily deviate) and avoid the vain and tedious loquacity wherewith they so often, and much torment us: You see (Mr. <hi>Lilly)</hi> I have followed <hi>Origanus,</hi> in not making <hi>Venus</hi> and <hi>Mercury</hi> Forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by their <hi>Orientality</hi>; (as I did, <hi>Anno</hi> 1645. up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on my <hi>Astrological Judgment,</hi> 7. <hi>May,</hi> according to <hi>Pezelius,</hi> (who maketh no distinction, as you may see, <hi>pag.</hi> 47.) because I would avoid all future ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils upon this occasion: But (by the way) I shall exhort you and <hi>John Booker</hi> to suspend your usual snarling, touching the fallibility of that Discourse; for your opprobrious speeches cannot injure me with Men of moderate judgment; nor can the frequent and eager reiterating thereof, cloak or excuse your
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:49861:140"/>
ignorance in point of Art: What I then writ, was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to a <hi>supposed time taken,</hi> and delivered me (by a <note n="*" rend="inter">
                              <hi>Capt.</hi> E. A.</note> Gentleman of Quality.) And you know, in this case, the <hi>Tempus aestimatum</hi> is not to be rectified as in <hi>Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vities</hi>: I know no true <hi>Trutina</hi> for that (Sirs.) And a few Minutes error in time, will alter the whole face of Heaven; which must needs vary the judgment, being derived from a different position; I was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quested to deliver my Opinion according to the time given me, which was as you saw: Yet I never in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended it for the Press, had not the importunity of some Friends prevailed with me. And I am able to maintain the same Opinion (in point of Art) accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the time supposed, against the proudest State-pleaser that dare oppose me. But admit what you would have the World to believe, That it had been an Error of Judgment, without relation had to any mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake in time; why (I pray Sirs) is not an Error in the <hi>Astrologer</hi> as tolerable as in the <hi>Divine, Physician,</hi> or <hi>Lawyer,</hi> or in men of any other Profession? Is the <hi>Divines</hi> Judgment always <hi>Gospel?</hi> Does the <hi>Physician</hi> always Cure? Is the <hi>Lawyers</hi> Opinion ever Infallible? Does the <hi>Logician</hi> still prove? Or the <hi>Rhetorician</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways perswade? So long as we are Men, we must be subject to Infirmities, Over-sights, and Errors; <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manum est errare.</hi> And (which is more) it is the pleasure of <hi>God</hi> many times to frustrate the portents of Heaven for the sins of the People; who otherwise might partake of their Natural sweetness and benig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. It was a wise saying of a Learned Divine, yet living, That <hi>When God will have a People beaten, he ties their Hands behind them.</hi> And this (I am sure) hath been the unhappiness of the <hi>Loyal Party:</hi> But shall therefore the <hi>Astrologer</hi> be blamed for adhering
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:49861:141"/>
to the <hi>Rules</hi> and <hi>Principles</hi> of his <hi>Art?</hi> I wonder with what truth Mr. <hi>Lilly</hi> in <hi>July</hi> last, Prognosticated of loss to the <hi>Parliament,</hi> and of any <hi>Motion</hi> of their <hi>Army Westward</hi>; and of so much <hi>Action</hi> there, when all men know their Party prevailed in every place of the <hi>Kingdom</hi> by one means or other; and that they had no need of sending any Forces into the <hi>West.</hi> And in the same Month of <hi>July,</hi> what intended he, think you, where he tatled of an <hi>Army</hi> wandring near <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford?</hi> You see by the course of <hi>Heaven,</hi> he conceived <hi>Oxford</hi> should have been holden still by the <hi>Kings Forces,</hi> when (notwithstanding) it was surrendred in <hi>June</hi> before. I could instance many hundreds more of his Errors in the rest of his foolish Pamphlets, as his <hi>Merlinus Anglicus Junior,</hi> the <hi>Starry Messenger,</hi> and especially in his fabulous, and most ridiculous <hi>Prophecy</hi> of the <hi>White King</hi> and <hi>Dreadful Dead-man</hi>; which me-thinks he should not think of without a blush, there being not so much as one sentence in it derived from Lawful Art; nor which hath answered one jot of his expectation: I shall pass by his <hi>Super-natural Sights and Apparitions,</hi> (so much laughed at) because it hath <hi>Imprimatur, John Booker,</hi> in the front of it: I shall not meddle with his <hi>Mother Shipton,</hi> nor his <hi>story</hi> of the <hi>Dumb Woman,</hi> because they are all of them foolish, frivolous, and false, and cannot become a Scholar. Do but compare <hi>Bookers Bloody Progno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticks</hi> against the Kingdom of <hi>Ireland</hi> upon this <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction</hi> of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Mars</hi> in <hi>Taurus,</hi> with the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful success the <hi>Irish</hi> have had against their Enemies (whether <hi>English</hi> or <hi>Scots</hi>) ever since; and you shall find, that <hi>John Booker</hi> hath been grosly mistaken in his <hi>Astrology</hi>: But this his Error is meerly in the Rules of Art, which is no way excusable: For whatsoever I delivered, was rightly grounded upon Art: And I

duly cited my Authors for it, for the Readers better satisfaction, which I conceive sufficient for any Artist, whether the event be answerable or not: For as it is not enough for an Artist to content himself alone with the Rules and Observations of his Predecessors, but that he ought to add something of his own, whereby to propagate the Learning which he studies: No more is it Lawful for any man to delude the World with the foolishness of his own deluded fancy, and idle con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions alone, as both Mr. <hi>Lilly</hi> and <hi>Booker</hi> have fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently done, wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>As for the mistake (I will not say Malice) of that <hi>Practitioner in the Mathematicks,</hi> Mr. <hi>Henry Harflete,</hi> in his <hi>Vox Coelorum,</hi> or <hi>Predictions defended, &amp;c.</hi> who in the 49 page of that Book doth wrongfully intimate (to my disparagement) as if I should say, that a <hi>Fixed Star</hi> might properly be said to be <hi>Aspected</hi> with any <hi>Planet</hi>: I must tell him, that Accusation of his is very untrue: And whether it proceeded from his misguided and inconsiderate Zeal to Mr. <hi>Lilly,</hi> or out of any dis-affection to me, deserves a gentle lash, in that I am most certain, he cannot produce any such assertion of mine, either in word or writing. It is true, that Mr. <hi>Lilly</hi> taxed me for saying that <hi>Mars</hi> was in a <hi>Sextile Aspect</hi> with <hi>Caput Draconis,</hi> in my <hi>Alma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nack</hi> 1645. which was an Error of the Press: (the Character of <hi>Caput Draconis</hi> being mistaken for the Character of <hi>Leo,</hi> as I have sufficiently proved in my Answer to Mr. <hi>Lilly,</hi> Printed with my <hi>Prognostication</hi> for 1647.) but that I ever mentioned any <hi>Fixed Star</hi> to be Aspected by any <hi>Planet,</hi> in that, or any other of my Writings, (unless Mr. <hi>Harflete</hi> will say that the <hi>Dragons Head</hi> is a <hi>Fixed Star</hi>) is both fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volous and false: And therefore I shall desire that
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:49861:142"/>
Critical Gentleman to examine the words of my <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnostication</hi> for that Year, and my aforesaid Answers to Mr. <hi>Lilly</hi>'s Objections, and I presume he will shew me so much Civility as to revoke that his unadvised Censure, and excuse me of Ignorance in that parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular: And yet I could have stopped Mr. <hi>Lilly</hi>'s mouth with these words of <hi>Leapoldus, Tract.</hi> 5. <hi>de annorum revolutionibus,</hi> viz. <hi>Mali aspectus ad Caud. Drac. sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificant famem, frigus, &amp; pestilentiam.</hi> Nor is this Author an <hi>Utopian,</hi> or single in that expression: But I am of a different Opinion, and therefore shall not insist longer on these trivialties, which are fitter for Mr. <hi>Booker</hi> to instruct his Daughter <note n="*" rend="inter">
                              <hi>A Child of his, so Named in me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of the Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry near</hi> York.</note> 
                           <hi>Victoria</hi> in, than to be thought on by men of riper Judgments.

                        <p>The first I meet with, is, the first of his <hi>Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, page</hi> 36. where he saith, That <hi>Saturn and Mars are Culminating with that Fatal Star Caput Algol, or the head of Medusa, &amp;c.</hi> This (<hi>Jack</hi>) is both an <hi>improper,</hi> and a <hi>false</hi> expression of yours.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. For any man may see, that (in the precedent <hi>Scheme</hi>) the <hi>Conjunction</hi> of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Mars</hi> hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens near the end of the 4. <hi>House</hi> of the Heavens, from the <hi>Ascendant; In imo Coeli,</hi> the lowest part, or bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of Heaven: Now (Sir) how any <hi>Planet</hi> or <hi>Star</hi> in this part of the Heavens, can be said prop<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="251" facs="tcp:49861:142"/>
For my part, I cannot devise, how he can avoid or excuse this improper Phrase of his, unless he tell me, <hi>The World is turned up-side down,</hi> and in that sense he choaks me, and I am bound to credit him, and cry him mercy.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. It is most false, contradicting a General received Rule of <hi>Astrologers,</hi> because you instance the proxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Mars</hi> to <hi>Caput Algol,</hi> (in the word <hi>With</hi>) to annex a <hi>Debility</hi> more to each of them than really they have: For, and so far are they from that <hi>Fixed</hi> and <hi>violent Star,</hi> that it is not to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted for any <hi>Debility</hi> by the Opinion of any <hi>Astro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loger</hi> that ever I read, they being above 7 <hi>degrees</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant from it: For <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Mars</hi> (as before we noted) are in 14 <hi>degrees,</hi> 27 <hi>min.</hi> And (according to <hi>Copernicus) Caput Algol</hi> is in 21 <hi>degr.</hi> 30 <hi>min.</hi> of <hi>Taurus,</hi> which is 7 <hi>degr.</hi> and 13 <hi>min.</hi> difference: And according to <hi>Origanus, pag.</hi> 540. <hi>Garcaeus, pag.</hi> 249. <hi>Pezelius, pag.</hi> 48. And all other <hi>Astrologers</hi> both Ancient and Modern, the Planets are never truly said to be Debilitated by <hi>Caput Algol,</hi> unless they be <hi>Intra distantiam quinque graduum A. vel P.</hi> which you see these Planets are not.</p>
                        <p>The next thing I shall desire the indifferent Reader to take notice of, is, his own <hi>Scheme</hi> of this <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction,</hi> and in it the <hi>Cusp</hi> of the 5. <hi>House,</hi> as he hath made it; and you may observe that <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Mars</hi> are but 2 <hi>degrees</hi> 33 <hi>min.</hi> distant from the same: Yet nevertheless in the 37 page of his Pamphlet, he taketh his Judgment from the 4. <hi>House,</hi> which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to <hi>Origanus,</hi> and divers other Authors, and to Mr. <hi>Lilly</hi> likewise, who allow 5 deg. preceding, and 5 deg. subsequent for the <hi>Cusp</hi> of each House: Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to which Rule, he ought to have given Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from the 5. House, and not from the 4. You
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:49861:143"/>
remember (<hi>Jack</hi>) how Mr. <hi>Lilly</hi> spit his Venom at me in the 35 page of his <hi>Anglicus</hi> for 1645. for giving judgment of <hi>Jupiter</hi>'s being in the 4. and <hi>Mars</hi> in the 6. (according to the Opinion of <hi>Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metius</hi>) when they were within less than 5 deg. of the <hi>Cuspes</hi> of the 5. and 7. <hi>Houses.</hi> Now, I wonder much, how you dare dissent from your <hi>Loving Friend</hi> Mr. <hi>Lilly,</hi> especially in this particular, considering what you said in your last page of your Epistle to the Reader, <hi>viz. That Mr.</hi> Lilly <hi>and you have the same Principles in Art, and that your Judgments in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral will have answerable success.</hi> And, that Mr. <hi>Lilly</hi> may see, it is no mistake in you, but meer Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, let him peruse your Prog. for this Year 1646. and in the <hi>Spring-Quarter</hi> he shall find you giving Judgment upon <hi>Mercury</hi>'s <hi>being in the</hi> 10. <hi>House</hi>; when in Mr. <hi>Lilly</hi>'s own Scheme (erected for the same Latitude, Meridian, and Moment of time) he want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth but 2 deg. and 9 min of the 11. <hi>House.</hi> And now (<hi>Jack</hi>) do you think Mr. <hi>Lilly</hi> will not shake his Head at you for this gross contradiction? Would he have thought it possible, that his fellow-champion (in <hi>State-Astrology) John Booker,</hi> would have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicted him, and joyned in Opinion with those two <hi>Malignants, Naworth</hi> and <hi>Wharton</hi> at <hi>Oxford?

                        <p>But I know no Reason why you should subject the Kingdom of <hi>Ireland</hi> to the ill Influence of <hi>Saturn,</hi> more than any other Nation that is under the division of <hi>Taurus, Scorpio, Aquarius,</hi> and <hi>Leo</hi>; for we know, <hi>Helvetia, Cyclades Islands, Russia, Asia, Cyprus</hi> the lesser, <hi>Media, Parthia,</hi> a great part of <hi>Swedeland, Lorrain, Campania, Rhetia, Franconia, Persia,</hi> and many more Kingdoms, and particular Towns and Cities are in the same division, and as much, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther more concerned than <hi>Ireland</hi>: All that can be truly said, is only, that <hi>Ireland</hi> is like to participate with the rest of the Kingdoms, &amp;c. before mentioned, in the Influence of this Conjunction, whether it be for good or evil.</p>
                        <p>For you to say, that in regard of the horrid Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders that have been there committed upon the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants of that Kingdom, it is likeliest to undergo the Divine Justice of God more than the rest; it is no Astrological Reason, nor (for ought you know) may some of the other Kingdoms before named, be less guilty of the same sins than <hi>Ireland</hi>; or deserve a less share of the ill Influence of this Conjunction: I pray, <hi>Jack,</hi> let you and I suspend our judgments from in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termedling, much more determining, things of that Nature. It is more proper for Divines than Astro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logers.</p>
                        <p>That which we ought to do, is to contain our selves within the limits of Nature: And it is questionable whether the <hi>English, Irish,</hi> or <hi>Scots</hi> have been the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of that Barbarism and Blood-shed you mention: For he that will lay aside Passion and private Interest, and rightly consider the real and radical causes of the

                        <p>But to return again to <hi>John Booker,</hi> (for I will not lose him yet) I would gladly demand a Reason from him in Art, for his menacing of <hi>France,</hi> or <hi>Spain</hi> with vengeance for assisting the <hi>Irish:</hi> Or why the <hi>Pope</hi> should come in any danger of hazarding his <hi>Triple Crown</hi> in the Quarrel: Unless the <hi>States</hi> intend to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance for <hi>Italy:</hi> If they do, they may do well to transmit the <hi>Directory</hi> to <hi>Rome,</hi> as the pre-cursor of a new <hi>Reformation</hi> there: But I am afraid Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> his Courage will cool at the conceit. Nor is it perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent to the handling of this <hi>Conjunction,</hi> for <hi>Booker</hi> to tell us an old story of the <hi>Spanish Armado</hi> in 88. or of the <hi>Gun-powder Treason,</hi> 1605. The wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of those Devilish attempts are both thought on, and abhorred by every true <hi>English</hi> Christian.</p>
                        <p>Or of what concernment is the Decollation of <hi>Mary,</hi> Queen of <hi>Scots, Anno</hi> 1587. to the Kingdom of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> because that when she was Beheaded, <hi>Saturn</hi> was in <hi>Taurus,</hi> as now he is?</p>
                        <p>Or of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Mars</hi> their being conjoyned in the Year 1588. a little before the <hi>Spanish Armado</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared upon the <hi>English Coast?</hi> Does not <hi>John Booker</hi> here most wretchedly confound himself? Instead of
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:49861:148"/>
going about to prove <hi>Saturn</hi>'s Progress through <hi>Tau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> Ominous to <hi>Ireland,</hi> he contrarily produces Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples, which prove that Position dangerous to <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> and <hi>Scotland.</hi> For (whatever his meaning be) he instances not any one thing hurtful to <hi>Ireland</hi> in ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of those Years: And then he robs Sir <hi>Christopher Heydon</hi> of more than a whole Page, concerning the general Occurrences in the World, which happened in 88. without any mention made of that <hi>most Learned and Judicious Knight.</hi> And so he proceeds (to fill up the remainder of his Malicious Pamphlet) with railing at the <hi>Irish,</hi> telling them, how they have ever been most <hi>Rebellious</hi> and <hi>Treacherous</hi> to the <hi>English Nation,</hi> and have most Barbarously and Inhumanely Murthered many thousand Souls, &amp;c. But we know of another Kingdom that hath sometimes been more Rebellious and Treacherous than they, for less cause. But I never heard of any Souls that ever either of them Murthered. I speak not this to justifie or main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain any inhumane Action in <hi>Ireland,</hi> or elsewhere, (for my Nature abhors all manner of Cruelty to the worst of Men; I think I could not harm either Mr. <hi>Lilly</hi> or <hi>John Booker</hi> in word or deed, if I had them in my power, but rather use them with all civil respect and courtesie, if they were worse than they be) nor to countenance <hi>Treason</hi> and <hi>Rebellion:</hi> That I need not, it hath been sufficiently done by a far greater Power. But the thing I aim at, is, to unmask <hi>Booker</hi>'s inveterate hatred to that distressed Nation; who if he were but half so Charitable, as he is either unreaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, or ignorant, he would not attempt to Assassine the <hi>Honour</hi> of a whole <hi>Nation</hi> with his Invectives, but rather suspend these his rash Censures, and wish a hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Union, than the confusion of so many Christians.</p>

                           <pb n="264" facs="tcp:49861:149"/>The remainder of his Pamphlet tends to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of <hi>Astrology,</hi> (wherein he still plays the Thief with Sir <hi>Chr. Heydon</hi>) and of the Planet <hi>Venus</hi> her appearance in the day time, at the Birth of our most hopeful Prince <hi>Charles,</hi> which he saith (if she presigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth any thing) was the Miseries of this Kingdom: Because (saith he) it is usual, and an ordinary thing, for <hi>Venus</hi> to be seen in the day time. I grant him, that it is both usual, and ordinary; but not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways at the Birth at <hi>Princes.</hi> It is both usual and ordinary for <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Mars</hi> to be in <hi>Conjunction,</hi> and shall we therefore say it presignifies nothing? I confess, I have not seen any Authors that handle such Appearances, nor hath <hi>Booker</hi> any other Authority than his foolish Fancy, for saying she was the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dromus</hi> of these unhappy differences in <hi>England</hi>: But he that shall make inspection into the Positure of the Heavens, when <hi>Venus</hi> was <hi>in Apog. Eccentrici,</hi> or in her greatest distance from the Sun, shall find matter more than ordinary, whereon to fix his Contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. And I am of Opinion, that her glorious ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance at the <hi>Nativity</hi> of our hopeful Prince <hi>Charles,</hi> did presignifie things (not yet thought upon) <hi>that may ere long amaze the unjust Usurpers of his Royal Fathers Birth-right.</hi> But no more of that this Year.</p>
                        <p>I will not trouble my self much longer with this Malicious Fellows Errors and Impertinencies, nor with his scurrillous Language belch'd out against an <hi>Irish Gentleman,</hi> who writ an <hi>Almanack,</hi> Printed at <hi>Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terford</hi> in <hi>Ireland.</hi> I never saw the Book, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I cannot judge of any thing in it, nor admit of any such thing as <hi>Booker</hi> pretends to have Corrected him in. For I have it from good hands, that the Gentleman is so knowing a Scholar, that it is incredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:49861:149"/>
he should be guilty of such gross Errors, as <hi>Booker</hi> hath charged him with. And you have seen how able a Man <hi>Booker</hi> is to Correct any body: But were I that <hi>Manapian</hi> he speaks of, I would reward him with another <hi>Scheme</hi> for the future <hi>Opposition</hi> of the same Planets, which happens upon the 20 day of <hi>Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi> 1647. at half an hour past 6 a Clock in the Morning, <hi>Saturn</hi> being then in 0. <hi>deg.</hi> 27 <hi>min.</hi> of <hi>Gemini,</hi> (the <hi>Ascendant</hi> of <hi>London</hi>) and <hi>Mars</hi> in 0. <hi>deg.</hi> 27 <hi>min.</hi> of <hi>Sagit.</hi> as appeareth by the <hi>Figure,</hi> which I have Calculated exactly for the <hi>Meridian</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> because it will much concern the <hi>South</hi> and <hi>West</hi> parts of <hi>England,</hi> and that in a higher measure than the <hi>Conjunction</hi> (before treated of) doth the Kingdom of <hi>Ireland.</hi>

Who would ever have thought that Christians, that Civil People, that any Men would thus have violated all Religion, all Laws, and all Honest and Civil demeanor? And although the Heavens blush at the view, and the Earth sweats at the burthen of so vile a Villany, and all Men proclaim, and exclaim upon shame and confusion against them, yet they neither feel the horror, nor shrink at the shame, nor fear the revenge; but stand upon terms, some of Defence for the Lawfulness of their dealing, and some of Excuse for the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity. Well, let them be able to blind the World, and to resist Mans Revenge; yet shall they never be able to escape either the sight, or vengeance of Almighty God, which we daily expect, and earnestly desire to be poured upon them. Alas, good King <hi>Charles,</hi> thy Nature was too gentle, and thy Government

too mild for so stiff and stubborn a People: What King will ever repose any trust in such <hi>unnatural Subjects,</hi> but fetter them with Laws, as Thieves are with Irons?

                  <p>IT is a common Proverb, <hi>Dogs bark more for Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom, than Fierceness.</hi> And had I not assuredly known this <hi>Whelp, Lilly,</hi> to be one of that bawling Litter, I should not have suffered his perpetual snarl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with that Patience and Temper I did; but before this, would have alighted from my Saddle, to hurle him one stone (at the least) to gnaw on. But, as he is now grown bolder, and blacker in the jaws, I must begin to have an Eye over him, and a care to keep him at a distance, lest he bite me till I bleed, and thereby I become maniaque, or Brain-sick like himself, and so be more desirous of his <hi>Liver</hi> than his <hi>Heart.</hi> I shall scorn to take notice of his former Grinnings; nor will I trouble my self, or the Reader, with any repetition of his by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>past Fooleries, frantick Expressions, and but a few, (if any) of his many Errors and Mistakes, so grosly committed, in every of his Lowzy-Pamphlets (for them (indeed) I have tyed and twitch'd up together in a Pack-thread, as thinking them fitter for his <hi>Quon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> Hell, than the meanest Shelf in my Study) but I will content my self only with that dainty bit, this sweet Brat of his own begetting, <hi>Merlini Anglici Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meris,</hi> the fourth (and perhaps the last) of that name: And examine I shall, and that strictly, of what metal it is compounded, or whether it be simple (like the Dad of it) and the truth you have freely, as followeth.</p>

                  <head>The Errors, Mistakes, and Mis-applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Mr. <hi>Lilly's</hi> New Epheeme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                  <p>I Will not trouble my self, or the Reader in taking notice of any thing in his Long-winded-Preface, save only the reverend mention he hath made con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning him, whom he is pleased to term an <hi>A. B. C.</hi> fellow, <hi>viz. Naworth</hi> of <hi>Oxford,</hi> by whom (as he pretendeth) he found himself intolerably abused in Print, and could do no less, than vindicate himself in point of Art.</p>
                  <p>As for the Name, <hi>Naworth,</hi> which <hi>William Lilly,</hi> and <hi>John Booker</hi> (to make their Worships merry) have so often, and as wisely, as wittily, inverted to <hi>No-worth,</hi> and <hi>Worth-nothing</hi>: it is well known, to be the Letters of my name long since transposed, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posely to avoid the Scandal, and obloquy, which both these Mounte-banks so greatly delight in, and indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour so much to assume. For, whereas I observed, the Common people generally possessed of a confident beliefe, or rather a foolish conceipt, that such as could write Almanacks, were esteemed (with a Country-reverence) Wise-men (like <hi>Lilly</hi> and <hi>Booker</hi>) or (if I shall render it in their own Dialect) Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurers, or such as can tell all things, past, present, and to come: And so were usually haunted (by the silly people) with a number of unlawful, unnecessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and ridiculous questions: by means whereof, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ingenious and honest Artists, have not only been
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:49861:155"/>
branded with the titles of Conjurers, Necromancers, Wizards, Sorcerers, and Figure-Casters (in the worst sense) but have often been imprisoned, and Indicted and proceeded against upon the Statute a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Witchcraft, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and hardly escaped with their lives, (especially when they came before Judges, that were ignorant in, or disaffected to <hi>Astrology</hi>) after they had suffered several years imprisonment, and thereby wasted and consumed their estates: I say, that I having resolved to write yearly, which was not usual without prefixing a name; (nor for the reasons above mentioned, would I then publish any thing of that nature, in my own name:) I therefore Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grammatiz'd my name to <hi>Naworth,</hi> and by that Name I writ an Almanack for several years together, and continued unknown, unless to some two or three of my friends; whereby I seasonably prevented the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-named inconveniencies and hazards, which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise I should inevitably have shared of: And I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume that in doing this, I neither wrong'd my self, nor abused the Country where I lived: And whatever other witty construction may be made thereof, by these two trifling Gypsies; by this they may perceive, I took no delight (as they do) to be termed a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurer, a Magician, a Cabalist, a <hi>Merline,</hi> a trucking Mercury, or any thing else, whereby they desire, and endeavour so much to promote, and propagate their deceitful and unwarrantable dealings.</p>
                  <p>And whereas <hi>Lilly,</hi> in the same Preface, chargeth me under the same name to have wrested many false judgments from Astrology, against the Parliaments actions, intending thereby to prepossess the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom with a vain fear, that His Majesty and his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs should take place, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I must tell him, that this his Accusation, is most maliciously false: And
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:49861:155"/>
let him shew me (if he can) but one Aphorism, or Sentence that ever I delivered, for which I either quoted not my Authors, or gave a sufficient reason in Astrology: or that ever (of which I shall hereafter prove him apparently guilty) I wrested any part of Astrology from the Genuine sense thereof, either to make for his Majesty, or against the Parliament? And if it hath pleased God, to suffer the Loyal party thus to be trampled over, it is for their sins: and car<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ies with it a supernatural Cause and Reason above the stars, which could not be discerned, by the clearest mortal eye. No Symptome of such (our sufferings, could be read, or observed by such man in the great Book of Heaven; but rather the quite contrary, as I could instance for many reasons in Astrology: And whatsoever I spoke, or writ, was (as your own sense imploys) ever with submission to divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence.</p>
                  <p>But I will not busie my self so much, as to examine and retort every Tatter of his ragged-Preface: nor shall I need to vindicate his Majesties Officers, (whom he is therein pleased to term <hi>Ravenous</hi>) from his polluted lips: I see no reason why they may not meet with a fitter occasion and opportunity to require him: but the thing I have proposed to my self, is first, to ferret the poor Quack inpoint of <hi>Art,</hi> and afterwards in matter of <hi>Judgment.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The first thing, and indeed the only thing that's worth my observation is, his Transcript of <hi>Eichsta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius</hi> his Ephemerides, for the year 1647 wherein (indeed) he hath taken a great deal of pains, and deserves to be commended for this indefatigable La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour: but withal, I must tell him, that he hath the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in greatly betrayed his own ignorance in Astronomy, or shewed himself exceedingly negligent and careless,
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:49861:156"/>
in that he hath not fitted the places of the Sun, <hi>Venus,</hi> and <hi>Mercury,</hi> (but especially the Moon,) to the Meridian of <hi>London,</hi> as he hath done (to his thinking) in the Lunations and Aspects of the Planets, nor (which had been more easie, and sooner done) prescribed any Rule, or Direction, whereby to supputate their true places for that Meridian, or any other place of the Kingdom: And this Error he hath been guilty of throughout the two former years: whereby our young Tyro's are much deceived in the <hi>Merline,</hi> when they think they have the places of those Planets therein exactly Calculated to the Noon-tide of every day at <hi>London:</hi> for although in the higher Planets, whose motion is but slow, there be no sensible difference: yet, in the Sun, <hi>Venus</hi> and <hi>Mercury,</hi> there is an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent error: For, when they are in their swift mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, their places at noon, as <hi>Lilly</hi> hath set them, will differ about 2. min. and often 3. min. from the truth: And in the Moon (whose motion is far swifter than any other of the Planets) her Error is intolerable (especially when she is in her swift motion.) For ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample: the first of <hi>January</hi> 1647. the Diurnal mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Moon is 12. degr. 24. min. (being then but in her slow motion.) The difference of Meridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, betwixt <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Uraniburge</hi> (to which place the Longitude of the Planets, (as <hi>Wil. Lilly</hi> hath print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them) were Calculated by <hi>Eichstadius,</hi>) is 50 minutes, (by his own confession in his <hi>Anglicus</hi> 1645. <hi>Page</hi> 54.) that is, the Sun cometh later to the Meridian at <hi>London,</hi> than he does at <hi>Uraniburge,</hi> by 50. Min. of time; so that how much soever the Moon moveth (according to Longitude) in that space of time; by so much hath <hi>Lilly</hi> erred in the Moons true place at noon, for every day in the year: which, what it is for the said first of <hi>January,</hi> I examine thus:</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="279" facs="tcp:49861:156"/>If the Moon in 24 hours, move 12 degrees, 24 minutes in Longitude,</p>
                  <p>What moves she in 50 min. of time?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Facit</hi> 26 <hi>min. ferè.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And by so much hath <hi>Lilly</hi> erred from her true place the said first of <hi>January</hi> at Noon: So that whereas he hath placed her that day in 21 degrees, 10 min. of Pisces, she ought to have been in 21 degrees 36 min. of the same Sign.</p>
                  <p>And when she is in her swift motion, he commits a greater Error: as the tenth of <hi>March</hi> 1647. (if you examin it according to the former rule) you shall find just half a degree (or 30 min.) error; and in stead of 26 degrees, 3 min. of Virgo, (wherein <hi>Lilly</hi> hath put her that day) she should be in 26 degrees 33 min. of the same Sign.</p>
                  <p>The next thing which I mean to take notice of, is, his Scheme erected to the Apparent time of the Moons Eclipse upon the tenth of <hi>January</hi> 1647. at 9. hours and 19 min. <hi>P. M.</hi> as he hath taken it from <hi>Eichsta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius,</hi> by deducting 50 min. for the difference of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridians betwixt <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Uraniburge:</hi> and to the same time I erect the Figure of Heaven, according to the Doctrine of <hi>Regiomontanus</hi>; and comparing his printed Scheme with that, which I had more curiously set, I find <hi>Lilly</hi> still bungling and botching, but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any result of truth: For, whereas he hath made the Cuspe of the tenth House 22 degrees 20 min. of Gemini, according to exact Calculation, it is no l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ss than 23 degr. 30. minutes, whereby it appears, that Master <hi>Lilly</hi> hath mistaken 1 degree, and 10 min. in the Cuspe of the <hi>Medium Coeli.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And in the Ascendent of the same figure, he ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>h mistaken above one whole degree, <hi>viz.</hi> 1 degr. 10 min. for he hath made the Cuspe thereof but 23 deg
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:49861:157"/>
and 51 min. of <hi>Virgo,</hi> which should have been 25 degrees, and 1 min. and the like Errors follow in the seventh house of the Figure; and proportionably in all the rest, which makes me wonder with what face this sensless botcher dares term me an <hi>A. B. C.</hi> fellow, when all men may perceive him so shamefully igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant in the very fundamentals of the Art he pretends to, and that I am able to correct him in every point and particle of his profession: For, I desire the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to consider but thus much with me, that if (as Sir <hi>Christopher Heydon</hi> hath said, in his unparallell'd Treatise, written in defence of Judicial Astrology against Mr. <hi>Chambers</hi>) that Astrology is an Art which teacheth by the Motions, Configurations, and influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of the Signs, Stars, and Coelestial Planets to Prognosticate of the natural effects, and mutations to come in the Elements, and these inferiour and ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary bodies: How (I pray) is it possible, that this fellow can Prognosticate rightly of the natural effects and Mutations to come in the Elements, and these inferiour and elementary bodies, before he be able to Calculate exactly the true motions and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gurations, <hi>&amp;c.,</hi> of the Signs, Stars and Planets, which you clearly see, he is not? And I marvel much that <hi>Lilly</hi> should be no more tender and cautelous of his credit, then thus foolishly and frequently to divulge his unskilfulness: for me thinks, as he knows that he cannot Calculate the Houses exactly, either by the Doctrine of Spherical Triangles, or, (which is more ready, and built upon the same foundation) by the Tables of Directions in <hi>Regiomontanus</hi>) to the degree and minute of each Cusp, yet he should have held it a safer way (if he purposed to palliate his defects) to have set down the Cuspes only in whole degrees, and not have published himself thus erroniously scrupulous,
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:49861:157"/>
which he might have done very easily, by the Domify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing tables, without further help. But I perceive him so im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent, and shameless, that he neither heeds, nor cares what he does, or otherwise he would have been more wary in supputating the places of the Planets: For (according to <hi>Eichstadius,</hi> whom he endeavours to follow) the Sun (at the middle of the Eclipse) should have been in 56 minutes of <hi>Aquarius,</hi> and the Moon in 56 min. of the Opposite Sign <hi>Leo, Venus</hi> in <hi>Capri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corn,</hi> 24 degr. 29 min. and <hi>Mercury</hi> in <hi>Aquarius,</hi> 3 degr. 17. min. But this man's dscretion hath put the Sun in 53 min. of Aquarius, iand the Moon in 53 min. of <hi>Leo, Venus</hi> in 24. degr. 39 min. of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pricorn,</hi> and <hi>Mercury</hi> in the 3 degr. 20 min. of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quarius; So that he hath erred 3 min. in the places of the Luminaries, and <hi>Mercury</hi>; and 10 min. in <hi>Venus,</hi> as may appear to every man, that will take the pains to Calculate the true places of these Planets by <hi>Eich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stadius</hi> his Table, to the Mean, or Equal time of the said Eclipse.</p>
                  <p>And in like manner, hath he playd the Botcher in his Figure at the Vernal ingress: for according to the time therein posited, the Cuspe of the tenth House ought to be 13 degr. 44 min. of <hi>Taurus,</hi> and the Ascendent 25 degr. 48 min. of <hi>Leo,</hi> yet he hath made the tenth House 14. degr. 0 min. of <hi>Taurus,</hi> and the Ascendent 26 degr. 0 min. of <hi>Leo</hi>: so that he hath committed 16 min. Error in the Cuspe of the tenth House, and 12 min. in the Cuspe of the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendent, nor is he less erronious in collocating of the Planets here, than in the former Figure, but especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in the Moon, whom he hath placed in 27 degree 48 min. of <hi>Virgo,</hi> whereas she ought to have been in 28 degr. 14 min. of that Sign, wherein he hath mistaken no less than 26 minutes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="282" facs="tcp:49861:158"/>And thus much I conceive sufficient to prove his ignorance in point of Art: Now will I also unmask his Errors, defects, mistakes, and mis-applications in matter of judgment.</p>
                  <p>I will not meddle with, or question upon what grounds Prince <hi>Charles</hi> left his Native Country of <hi>England,</hi> nor who were the original causes of this his so long absence; It is sufficient that <hi>Wil. Lilly</hi> confesses him to be <hi>Enforc'd upon necessity, exiled, or banished,</hi> for the honour of the <hi>English</hi> Parliament.</p>
                  <p>I will not enquire further, then of the <hi>Scottish</hi> Papers, whether the King be at present restrained from his Liberty, as <hi>Lilly</hi> tells us he is; Nor dare I interro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate by what Law of God, or Man, the King of <hi>Englands</hi> Person ought to be imprisoned, or be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed of, by either, or both of the two Kingdoms, or by any, or all of his Subjects: Or whether His im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisonment, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> be intended for the defence of his Majesties Royal Person, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and the Liberty of the Subject? Or how it can consist with the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the <hi>English</hi> Parliament to suffer his Majesties Honour thus to lye at the stake, and his Sacred Name to be traduced, by such Pamphlet-mongers as <hi>Lilly</hi> and <hi>Booker,</hi> and that Pillory-man <hi>Walker,</hi> without any restraint, or punishment.</p>
                  <p>Neither do I care, whether the Eclipse in <hi>Aug.</hi> 1645. pre-signified the P. of the Earl of <hi>Essex,</hi> or whether he have merited so much Honour, as to have a Statua in Crown Gold erected at the Charges of <hi>William Lilly,</hi> and an Epitaph made (and thereon en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graven) by <hi>Martin Parker,</hi> or <hi>Mercer</hi> (the Scot;) These things are all beside my Text, my intention being only to examine Master <hi>Merlin</hi>'s Astrological discourse, and to shew him, and all men wherein it is invalid, and no more.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="283" facs="tcp:49861:158"/>The judgment he hath given, is generally deduced from the position of the Heavens, at two distinct points of time, <hi>viz.</hi>
From the

                  </p>
                  <p>The Eclipse he makes the first general subject of his Discourse, the effects whereof (as he tells us) <hi>may be somewhat put forward by reason of a non-ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent Eclipse in the</hi> 15<hi>th. degree of Capricorn,</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember 26. 1646.</p>
                  <p>What the Simpleton meaneth by <hi>putting forward,</hi> I know not, 'tis no term in Astrology; but surely I have <hi>Put</hi> him out of doubt in my Prognostication, 1647. that Eclipses are not hurtful at all to those Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions, or Cities where they are not visible; yet lest the Testimony of that Learned Author therein men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned should not be enough to convince him of his Folly, I shall further recommend unto him the words of <hi>Cardanus</hi> upon <hi>Ptolomy, lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 5. <hi>Text</hi> 26. (if he can Translate them any better than he hath done the first fifty Aphorisms of the Centiloquie) they sound thus; <hi>Ut igitur locus à deliquio affici de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beat in Luna, duo sunt necessaria: Unum quod Luna tunc temporis in hemisphaerio superiore illius loci sit, &amp; cum Provincia illa concordet signo, vel trigono saltem: Secundo cum Civitate in solis loco, vel Lunae, vel Ascendent is, vel cum medio Coeli illius qui regit Civitatem ipsam.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>In sole verò necessarium est, praeter id quod fit su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pra terram, &amp; conveniat locus ejus Provinciae-vel Civitati Eclipsis ipsa appareat.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Whereby it is clear, that unless (in a Lunar Eclipse) the Moon be above the Earth, and likewise on the Sign, or at least in the Triplicity of that Sign where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:49861:159"/>
unto the Kingdom (in whose Hemisphere the Defect happeneth) is subject: And unless that the Sun, or Moon-place, or the Sign Ascending or Culminating, be also the Horoscopical Sign of the City, or Town (you live in, or enquire after) the Effects of such a Lunar Eclipse shall not any way concern that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom or City.</p>
                  <p>But in a Solar Eclipse it is necessary, (besides that the Sun be above the Earth, and that his place agree to the Kingdom, or City,) that the Eclipse be also vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible to the Kingdom or City, or otherwise the Effects shall in no wise concern the one or the other.</p>
                  <p>Now, the Solar Eclipse here (by him) mentioned, is not visible at all to us, for it appears in the Islands, <hi>de S. Pedro, Barbados, de Don Alfonso, de Praxaros,</hi> and to such as Sail beyond the Equator, and under the Tropick of <hi>Capricorn</hi> through the <hi>Persian</hi> Sea: And (indeed) in 13 and 14 deg. of North Latitude, it will be a very great Eclipse; but of what concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is this to <hi>England?</hi> or why should it put for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward this Lunar Eclipse in <hi>January,</hi> seeing it is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther visible to us (for at <hi>London</hi> it happeneth at their 11 a Clock at Night, and so the Luminaries are both under the Horizon,) nor yet is the degree Eclipsed in the Sign, or Triplicity of that Sign whereunto ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>England</hi> or <hi>Scotland</hi> are thought to be subject, which is required (by <hi>Cardanus</hi> his Rule) before the Effects can concern either. Whereby it appears that this Non-apparent Solar Eclipse can no way help or harm us, nor augment, or put forward the Effects of the Lunar Eclipse, and that <hi>William Lilly,</hi> in thus preferring his own idle Fancy beyond the Experience, and more solid Reasons and Rules of <hi>Campanella, Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danus,</hi> and of all other Authors that ever I read, or heard of, hath very much abused the Reader, and
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:49861:159"/>

                  <p>As touching the Lunar Eclipse in <hi>January,</hi> 1647. I have writ of it already in my Prognostication, wherein you may see what the Effects of it are; and those that desire further satisfaction, may have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course to <hi>Origanus,</hi> pag. 460. upon <hi>Mercury</hi>'s being Lord of an Eclipse, as he is of this. But although this Lunar Eclipse be visible, and fall out in a Sign of the Fiery Triplicity, and in that respect doth gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally concern <hi>England</hi>: Yet in regard it is so small, <hi>viz.</hi> but 4 digits, 47 min. 42 sec. its Effects will scarcely be felt, or observed by any body; For, as <hi>Eclipses nihil nocent illis Regionibus in quibus non vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentur</hi>; So, <hi>parvae Eclipses parum nocent, &amp; in pauca operantur.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is true, as both (<hi>Lilly</hi> in his <hi>Anglicus,</hi> and I in my Prog.) have in effect observed, that, <hi>in caeremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niis, religione</hi> (to which he adds <hi>in reditibus regiis) ac legibus mutationes affert.</hi> A likelyhood (as he saith) of some change, or alteration in Church-Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, in the Revenues of Kings, or more properly, in such matters as at present the Parliament make use of, for maintenance of their Wars and Affairs; and of altering or abolishing many Laws formerly in use. All this I grant him, and why may it not admit of thus much malignancy in the application thereof, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Kingdom are weary of the Presbyterial Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and will not endure the smell of Elders, for Gentlemen are (commonly) Scholars, and do Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally affect freedom in the Exercise of their Religion, and scorn to be constrained to give an account of their Belief to Broom-men, Coblers, Taylors, and Tinkers, or to any such Illiterate, Mechanick, and Profane Fellows; or to subject their Understandings to the
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:49861:160"/>
sense and Interpretation of so unsanctified a Society, and shall therefore wish for, and (must justly) en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour a change of Government in the Church. So likewise may His Majesties Revenue (so long detain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from him) be in a better possibility of regaining, or in some part restored to him, or at least great means used to perswade those that have Usurped the Posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion and Profits thereof to resign and account. And that many Ordinances, Orders, and Votes that have passed, and been formerly enjoyn'd, and observed, as Laws must admit of alteration and abolishment: But (as I have formerly noted) these things will not be done effectually this Year, in regard of the smal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the Defect, so that we shall be scarce sensible of its Operation. Yet without all doubt the Dragons Head in the tenth House (in the intercepted Sign <hi>Cancer</hi>) bodes very much good to His Majesty to be begun and wrought by the <hi>Scottish</hi> Nation, who shall partake of that Influence. And whereas <hi>Lilly</hi> adds, that <hi>Celerem Regis, Principis, vel nobilissimi viri ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cujus infirmitatem, vel praeclari viri cujuspiam mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem adducit:</hi> That this small Eclipse portends some sudden Infirmity, or Casualty to a King, Prince, or Worthy Man, perhaps some eminent and Famous Man's Death, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He had done well to have cited his Author, or given his Reasons for what he says here, for I cannot pick out any such signification from this Eclipse, as <hi>Mercury</hi> is truly and really Lord thereof: Nor as he hath made <hi>Mars</hi> and <hi>Saturn</hi> to be sharers with him: Indeed <hi>Mars</hi> stirs up Wars, Intestine Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, Tumultuous Uproars, the wrath of Princes, and by that means some unexpected slaughter: And <hi>Saturn</hi> premonstrates perturbation of the Humours, Fluxes, and Quartan Fevers, Poverty, and Banish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Dearth, Penury, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But I find no such sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:49861:160"/>
Infirmity, or Casualty to befall any King or Prince, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as he chatters of; yet I'le undertake for him, that if Prince <hi>Griffith</hi> should but this Year fall asunder of the Pox, the next Year after, <hi>Lilly</hi> will tell you that this Prediction was verified in him. Nor know I any Reason why <hi>Scotland</hi> should be at all concerned in it, seeing the Eclipse happeneth in the Fiery Trigon, and that the Ascendant of <hi>Scotland,</hi> which is <hi>Cancer,</hi> is of another, <hi>viz.</hi> the Watry Triplicity, nor at all As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spected by the Sign wherein the Eclipse happeneth, nor afflicted by either of the Malevolents, but rather Fortified by the presence of the Dragons Head in it (as before I noted) in the Mid-heaven; and although the Eclipsed Body be Dispositrix of the Sign <hi>Cancer,</hi> yet for the Reasons formerly given, the Effects of the Eclipse cannot be at all discerned in <hi>Scotland,</hi> or scarce in any part of <hi>England,</hi> and therefore it is but a foolery in <hi>William Lilly</hi> to make such a fluttering and a noise about nothing: But I am well pleased to hear him scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that one truth (if so it prove) that the <hi>Scots</hi> will stand like Oaks unshaken to their first Principles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It behoves some body else to remember their Cov<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>What he says against the <hi>Irish</hi> is not material: The more the Fox is curs'd, the better he thrives. But I suspect <hi>Lilly</hi> to be one of those <hi>London Adventurers,</hi> who were dividing the Bears Skin, before he was taken, (as His Majesty once told them.) If he were, I

presume a man might purchase <hi>Lilly</hi>'s share of the Land in <hi>Ireland</hi> at an easie rate: And although out of his Malice he tells them their Ruine is approaching, and threaten them with Cups, and even brimmers of Vengeance; I believe he may drink them there off himself, before they once pledge him. And although <hi>Booker</hi> (in his Bloody <hi>Irish</hi> Almanack) hath disgorg'd a filthy and confused heap and mass of Misery, Ruine, and Vengeance to befall that Kingdom, yet you have not heard of any considerable loss that they have su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stained since first that Malicious lying Pamphlet peep'd out into the World, which bears date on Tuesday the 17<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>March,</hi> 1645/6.

And now (Good-man <hi>Merlin</hi>) is not <hi>Saturn</hi> Lord of the seventh House, and posited almost in the very Cuspe of the Tenth? If this Aphorism prove true (as possibly it may, if the <hi>Scots</hi> and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament fall to pieces) you must invent other Epithets for the <hi>Scots</hi> than Prudent, Wise, and Religious Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, or else I know what will become of you.

                     <p>I have considered the Profectional Figure of the last Conjunction of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Jupiter,</hi> and find the <hi>Sun, Saturn, Jupiter,</hi> and <hi>Mercury,</hi> as you say, all in <hi>Cancer</hi>; yes, and more than that, I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served <hi>Aries</hi> Ascending, and <hi>Pisces</hi> Culminating, <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> in <hi>Gemini,</hi> and <hi>Luna</hi> in <hi>Libra</hi>: And I have made inspection into the sixth Revolution of the Sun to his place at the Parliaments beginning, and there I meet with the seventh degree of <hi>Virgo</hi> ascending, and the last degree of <hi>Taurus</hi> Culminating, and that <hi>Mercury,</hi> Lord of the Ascendant, is in 12 deg. 45 min. of <hi>Scorpio &amp; sub radiis solis</hi>: And the Moon is in 5 degr. 20 min. of <hi>Aquarius,</hi> in Opposition to <hi>Jupiter</hi> and <hi>Mars,</hi> who are near unto a perfect Conjunction in the eleventh House of the Figure in <hi>Leo,</hi> and she is also hastening to a Quartile with <hi>Saturn</hi> in the ninth. And I think (Sir) you will not deny but that <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury</hi> and the Moon are your Senators <hi>Significators.</hi> So that how fair soever you imagine these Positions to promise you, I am assured they will perform but slowly; you had done well to have shewn us some Testimony of the Peace you mention, but as you have denyed us that favour, let me instance you one Testimony to cross your conceit. You may see (Sir) that <hi>Jupiter</hi> and <hi>Mars</hi> are there also in Conjunction, and that in <hi>Leo,</hi> a Sign of the Fiery Triplicity, which is far worse than their Conjunction in <hi>Cancer</hi>; for, <hi>Mars in Leone significat bella &amp; contentiones, &amp; paucitatem annonae in partibus orientalibus, &amp; erit Mors in hominibus, &amp; maxime in juvenibus</hi> 40. <hi>Annorum us<expan>

And thus fair (and no fairer) are you pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised by the Annual return of the Sun to his place at the Parliaments Commencement, if you will credit <hi>Bonat.</hi> Colum. 365.

What the Position of <hi>Saturn</hi> in the 10. signifies in the Vernal Ingress, I have publish'd in my Prognostication: And if I should grant him what so much he desires and urgeth, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>Saturn</hi>'s being in the Mid-heaven should portend some sorrow and affliction to the King; yet <hi>Albumazar</hi> (a man of better Credit) affords us this comfort; <hi>Si fuerit domina decimae domus Venus</hi> (as she is in this Revolution) <hi>significat quod sequetur ex hac tribulatione prosperitatem atque sublimitatem &amp; gaudium atque profectum.</hi> If <hi>Venus</hi> be Lady of the tenth House, it sheweth that his affliction and sorrow shall be turned into Joy, Prosperity, Sublimity, and Advantage, the sight whereof will even break the Malicious heart of this proditorious Peasant.</p>

Debilities by 8, and is therefore to be accounted strong and powerful in the Figure, so that what De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triment soever her Debilities might promise, her For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes (being so many more in number) do utterly extinguish and annihilate, whereby is clearly signified good Fortune and Authority to Officials, and other of the Kings Head-Officers, and that the King shall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sper in his Affairs. So that the Reader may perceive your own Fancy so disturbed, and clouded, as that you cannot fancy, or discern any Sentence or Apho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rism that hath any shew in it of good towards His Majesty, but endeavour to conceal all things that tend thereunto, against your own Conscience, and the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Art. Nor can (in my Opinion) the Sun and <hi>Venus</hi> their being within Orbs, portend any kind of restraint to His Majesty, but rather absolute free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, in regard they are both His Majesties Significa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, and behold the Cusp of the twelfth House with an Aspect of true and perfect Amity.</p>

Here do I find the Sun Significator of our Honourable Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triots at</hi> Westminster, <hi>in his Exaltation, receiving</hi> Venus (<hi>His Majesties) in her Detriment, viz. in a low condition,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

                     <p>If the Conjunction of the Sun and <hi>Venus</hi> had been by Application, or a perfect Conjunction, you had said something to the purpose, but (Mr. Wisdom) you see <hi>Venus</hi> is separated from him, and the Moon, who is Significatrix of your Honourable Patriots, is hasting to an Opposition with them both, which are signs of small Affection, or Unity betwixt them; and as for that Reception you mention to be betwixt them, I will not grant any, for I learned when I was in my <hi>A. B. C.</hi> of Astrology, that <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptio est duplex, una ex domicilio, altera ex exalta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione:</hi> It is either from House, or Exaltation, which you cannot find here betwixt the Sun and <hi>Venus</hi>; for, although the Sun be in his Exaltation, yet <hi>Venus</hi> is not in hers, so that there is no Reception in respect of Exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; and for matter of House, you will grant there can be none. Yet I remember <hi>Zael</hi> admits of this, and one more, as a kind of Reception; and <hi>Origanus</hi> takes notice of them in him and <hi>Schonerus,</hi> and calls them <hi>Receptiones minores,</hi> but he does not commend, or allow them, but rather sets a mark upon them for invalid and Superstitious; for, saith he, <hi>Posteriores receptiones non nisi in particulari &amp; ad Superstitionem inclinante judicio locum habent, Pag.</hi> 427. So that if the Commonalty or Kingdom be no more Obedient and kind to the King than this reception inclines them to, I shall despair of any Peace or Tranquility this Year, nor expect better success of their formal addres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, than formerly.</p>

                        <hi>If we run a strain above Astrology, the Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metical Learning will tell us, that the Angels</hi> Samael <hi>and</hi> Malchidael <hi>are the Intelligences, or presiding An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels of the</hi> English <hi>Common-Wealth and Kingdom, and generally every Astrologer is satisfied, that</hi> Mars <hi>is the Planet, and</hi> Aries <hi>the Sign to which</hi> Great Britain

This Aphorism carries a great deal of Matter in it, in relation it hath to the differences depending and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending betwixt the <hi>Scots</hi> and the Parliament: And therefore it was not held fitting to be published, or
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:49861:169"/>
communicated (by our Mysterious <hi>Merlin</hi>) without a Fee. The plain <hi>English</hi> of it is, that (according to Natural causes) it is most evident that the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> shall be frustrated in their expectation; that they shall be much deceived, and deprived of the Profit and Commodity, which might have accrued unto them, by having the King at their own disposal: And that for this cause they shall fall at difference with, and incur the dislike and enmity of those that were formerly their Friends and Confederates, who shall account them no otherwise than such as have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got and neglected their Covenant with God and Man, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And hereupon they despair of the <hi>Scottish</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, because it is come nearer the Kings, and of their Faith, because they have not so much credulity as to interest them alone in the disposal of His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties Person: And hence arise new Discords and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions, and greater Taxes are imposed than ever upon the poor Kingdom, whereby Mens Estates are exhausted and consumed, and fresh Miseries daily ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching, if not timously prevented.</p>
                     <p>What he cites out of <hi>Haly</hi> concerning <hi>Jupiter</hi>'s po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siture in the eleventh House, I have sufficiently An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered and explained before, upon the words which he quoted from <hi>Bonatus,</hi> for the same thing.</p>
                     <p>And thus far hath Mr. <hi>Lilly</hi> made his Progress in Preaching Peace and Tranquility to the People, to what purpose, I have sufficiently declared. And now he comes to the Quality of the Year, wherein I scorn to detract the least scruple from him of what's his due, but shall agree with him in every thing which he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms but any thing like an Artist, (though he stum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of it against his will) his Quotation of <hi>Bonatus, Pag.</hi> 55.

<pb n="305" facs="tcp:49861:169"/>
and other Provision for the use of Man: But the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of his next Aphorism out of <hi>Haly</hi> is very illicite, and ignorant, for although he affirm it shall assuredly come to pass in those parts of this Kingdom which lye South-East, and full South from <hi>London,</hi> but nothing so violently as in the Kingdom of <hi>Ireland:</hi> I shall prove him here an errand Botcher. For, if he had understood the Aphorism, <hi>Saturn</hi> ought to be infortunate <hi>in alto loco,</hi> and elevated above all the other Planets, or otherwise it hath no signification, which he is not in this Figure; for although he be weak in his Essential Dignities, yet considering his other Accidental Fortitudes, he is indifferent strong and powerful, so that the Aphorism will not serve for this Position. And if you will know the principal ways by which a Planet may be said to be Elevated above another, they are three, <hi>viz.</hi>
In respect of their
<list>
                           <item>Latitude from the Ecliptique.</item>
                           <item>Nearness to their Auges.</item>
                           <item>Position in the Figure.</item>
                        </list>
                     </p>
                     <p>A Planet is said to be Elevated above another (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>Ganivetus, cap.</hi> 1. <hi>differ.</hi> 3. of his Book, Entituled <hi>Amicus Medicorum</hi>) who hath greatest Northern Latitude from the Ecliptique. Now, if we Calculate rightly, we shall find <hi>Mars</hi> Elevated above all the rest of the Planets, the Moon excepted, for he hath 3 degrees of North Latitude; and <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn</hi>'s Latitude is Meridional no less than 2 degrees 6 min. So <hi>Jupiter</hi> hath 0. degree 47 min. of North Latitude, <hi>Venus</hi> 1 degree 10 min. and <hi>Mercury</hi> 2 degrees 5 min. both South; and the Moon indeed hath 4 degrees 47 min. of North Latitude: So that in respect of Latitude, <hi>Saturn</hi> is the most depressed of
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:49861:170"/>
all the Planets in the Figure, and the Moon most Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated, next <hi>Mars,</hi> and then <hi>Jupiter.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The next way is in respect of a Planets propin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity to his Auge, according to <hi>Albohazen Haly</hi> in his Comment upon <hi>Ptolomy</hi>: So that the Planet which is nearest the Summity of his Epicycle, is Elevated above another, which is further removed thence, and if we consider here which of the Planets is most Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated <hi>secundum Augem,</hi> we shall find that <hi>Mercury</hi> is in <hi>Apog. Epicicli.</hi> 12 <hi>March, Mars</hi> is in <hi>Apog. Eccentr.</hi> the 14 of <hi>March,</hi> and <hi>Saturn</hi> is not in <hi>Apog. Epicicli</hi> until the fourth of <hi>May</hi> following: So that this way <hi>Mercury</hi> and <hi>Mars</hi> are both Elevated above <hi>Saturn.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And here by the way will I put Mr. <hi>Merlin</hi> in mind of one mistake in this kind committed in his <hi>England</hi>'s Prophetical <hi>Merlin, Pag.</hi> 78. Where he hath put <hi>Saturn transire Apog.</hi> on 20 <hi>Martii</hi> &amp; <hi>Jupiter Epicicli sui superiorem partem</hi> 23 <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tii,</hi> whereas <hi>Saturn</hi> is in <hi>Apog. Epicicli</hi> the 10 of <hi>March,</hi> and <hi>Jupiter</hi> the 13. So but only ten days Error in each committed.</p>
                     <p>The third way by which a Planet may be said to be Elevated, is in respect of their places in the Figure; as he that is above the Earth is more Elevated than he that is under the Horizon, he that is in the twelfth House is Elevated above another Planet in the Ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant, he that is in the eleventh, above any in the twelfth, and he that is in the tenth, above any other in the Figure, as indeed <hi>Saturn</hi> is now: And if all the Planets were under the Horizon, then that which is nearest to the Ascendant is said to be most Elevated; but this is not so much considered by Astrologers as their Elevation in respect of Latitude, and of their
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:49861:170"/>
proximity to their Auges, or if it were, yet you see there is two to one against <hi>Wil. Lilly</hi>: For <hi>Saturn</hi> is neither Elevated above all the other Planets in respect of Latitude, nor in respect of his Auge, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that Aphorism of <hi>Haly</hi>'s hath no signification here, <hi>Saturn</hi> being neither <hi>infortunatus in alto loco, nec sublevatus super omnes alios Planetas,</hi> as <hi>William Lilly</hi> supposes him. So that the South, and South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>east parts of this Kingdom need not fear this Positure at all.</p>
                     <p>Next, I desire the Reader to observe that he hath cut off, corrupted, and mis-understood that Aphorism in <hi>Bonatus,</hi> 574. <hi>viz. Significat naufragia repente, &amp;c.</hi> For that Aphorism is not deduced from the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion of <hi>Mars</hi> in the fourth and ninth Houses of the Figure; but (as you may see in <hi>Guido</hi>) from the Situation of <hi>Mars</hi> in <hi>Cancer</hi> and his Triplicity; and the words of <hi>Bonatus</hi> are these, <hi>Et si fuerit</hi> Mars <hi>in Revolutione anni in Cancro, vel ejus triplicitate: Et maxime in Cancro, erit apparitio eorum, quae signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caverit in partibus Septentrionalibus.</hi> And thus much of that Aphorism Master <hi>Merlin</hi> hath quite left our, which is thus much in <hi>English:</hi> If <hi>Mars</hi> in the Years Revolution shall be in <hi>Cancer</hi> or his Triplicity, but especially in <hi>Cancer,</hi> the visibility of his Effects shall be in the Northern parts of the Kingdom. Further, <hi>In Cancro significat naufragia repente v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Indeed (<hi>Lilly</hi>) you steer by a false Chart, for there is no such thing absolutely signified to the Governours you speak of, from the Sun, as he is Lord of the Ascendant, for he that will look into <hi>Guido, pag.</hi> 575. whence he takes this judgment, shall find the words to carry another sence, <hi>viz.

I'le lay my Life this Aphorism belongs to the Round-heads. What <hi>Venus</hi> portendeth in the ninth, as she is <hi>Signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficatrix</hi> of His Majesty, I have told you in my Prog. And what Mr. <hi>Lilly</hi> hath added out of <hi>Bonatus,</hi> 579. is not amiss; only his application is like all the rest, as idle and foolish as may be, in that it concerns all the Clergy in general, and not the Prick-ear'd Divines only, as every Artist can testifie.</p>
                     <p>Now, for that <hi>William Lilly</hi> seems to be very much offended with one Mr. <hi>Geere,</hi> who (as he saith) was sometimes a Priest of <hi>Tewksbury,</hi> and hath lately writ a Pamphlet, called <hi>Astrologo-mastix,</hi> (which indeed
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:49861:171"/>
is as full of old idle Sophistry, as Mr. <hi>Lilly</hi> is of Malice and Ignorance) yet I hold it no sufficient Answer to tell him a story of a Weather-cock, or a Cock and Bull, in stead of denying and avoyding his Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments by better Reason: Nor is it Scholar-like, or sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours at all of Common Civility, to fall upon scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalizing of a mans Reputation, when he hath not wit enough to requite him otherwise. I think (<hi>Lilly</hi>) you would scarce accept of it as a sufficient Answer from me, if instead of Correcting your Errors, I should tell the World, that you were but a Taylors Boy in St. <hi>Clements</hi> Parish, and that the summity of all your Honour, was to be afterwards a Scriveners Man, and that he dying, your Mistress taught you first to write Secretary, in which respect I account you not worthy of the just Revenge of my Pen. This (though it be true) were but mean Logick, but the truth is, you are lame of that Leg, and therefore you may do well to borrow a Crutch of Mr. <hi>Thomas Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loner,</hi> that precise Logician, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                  <p>For Example; Suppose a Conjunction of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Jupiter</hi> in some point of the Zodiack, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sid<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Then Multiply <hi>Twenty seven,</hi> and <hi>one third</hi> part of a <hi>Day</hi> by <hi>Twenty,</hi> and they make <hi>Five hundred forty six Years,</hi> and two <hi>thirds</hi> of a Year, for the time of the Effect of that Conjunction.</p>
                  <p>But yet it may ere that be obstructed by another <hi>Conjunction,</hi> especially after <hi>one half of the time</hi> be expired; for the Effect will be Naturally increased for the space of <hi>Two hundred seventy three Years,</hi> and <hi>one third part of a Year</hi>: And this when the <hi>Conjunction</hi> of all the <hi>Three</hi> shall be in one Point.</p>
                  <p>But admit the <hi>Moon</hi> should then be distant Thirty Minutes, we will take the <hi>Semi-diameters</hi> of the Moon, and therewith compare the Proportion of her distance, in such sort, as that we allow thereunto one half of the time, because her <hi>Semi-diameter</hi> is one half of her distance.

For although this <hi>Proportion</hi> be not altogether perfect, yet it is sensible, and near to the truth.</p>

                  <p>2. That the <hi>Effects</hi> be multiplyed in <hi>Strength</hi> like the <hi>Rarity,</hi> according to an exquisite Application.</p>
                  <p>As if <hi>Saturn</hi> have Four Vertues, <hi>Jupiter</hi> Five, <hi>Mars</hi> Three, and are all conjoyned in one Point; then let us multiply <hi>Three, Four,</hi> and <hi>Five</hi> together, and the Effect shall be <hi>Sixty</hi> in Strength, <hi>viz.</hi> twelve times so much to the Effect of <hi>Jupiter</hi> alone; fifteen times so much to <hi>Saturn,</hi> and twenty times so much to <hi>Mars.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But if <hi>Mars</hi> shall be distant one degree at a time when <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Jupiter</hi> are in Conjunction, we must multiply three Minutes of the <hi>Semi-diameter</hi> of <hi>Mars,</hi> into three, the Number of his Strength, and the <hi>Factus</hi> is Nine. Then Divide the Number by <hi>Sixty,</hi> (the number of Minutes in the distance of <hi>Mars</hi> from <hi>Jupiter</hi> and <hi>Saturn</hi>) and the <hi>Quotient</hi> is three twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth parts, which we multiply into <hi>Twenty,</hi> (the Number of the strength of the Conjunction of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn</hi> and <hi>Jupiter.</hi>) and the result is <hi>Three,</hi> whi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="314" facs="tcp:49861:174"/>
as the strength of <hi>Mars; six</hi> times so much as the strength of <hi>Saturn,</hi> and <hi>five</hi> times so much as the strength of <hi>Jupiter.</hi> And the like of the rest.</p>
                  <p>The strength of every <hi>Planet</hi> may be known by the <hi>Magnitude</hi> thereof, and the slowness of its Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for by how much greater the Planets be, and by how much slower they are in Motion, by so much stronger are they in <hi>General Causes,</hi> but not so in <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular.</hi> For Example,</p>
                  <p>I would know what Power <hi>Saturn</hi> hath in respect of the <hi>Moon,</hi> as to length or continuance of their Effects.</p>
                  <p>I see that <hi>Saturn</hi>'s <hi>Revolution</hi> is performed in <hi>Twenty nine Years,</hi> and <hi>Three hundred fifty eight Days</hi>; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in are 10750 Days. This I multiply into the <hi>Square</hi> of his <hi>Semi-diameter,</hi> and they make 96750 Days. In like manner, I multiply the <hi>Circuit</hi> of the <hi>Moon</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Squared Minutes of her <hi>Semi-diameter,</hi> and the <hi>Factus</hi> is 7899 Days, and one eighth part of a Day. I Divide the one by the other, and the <hi>Quotient</hi> is <hi>Twelve.</hi> And so much is the proportion of <hi>Saturn</hi>'s strength to the strength of the <hi>Moon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The same I say of <hi>Conjunctions,</hi> in respect of the length or Continuance of their <hi>Effects.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And it may be demonstrated in one word, because the <hi>Effects</hi> continue until the <hi>Return</hi>; as the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Jupiter</hi> till another Conjunction; and the <hi>Ingress</hi> of <hi>Saturn</hi> into the first point of <hi>Aries,</hi> untill his <hi>next</hi> entrance into the same <hi>Point.</hi> For, <hi>Nihil datur inane in Natura.</hi> And therefore, if the <hi>Effects</hi> should not continue until the <hi>Return,</hi> it were a <hi>Mathematical Circuit,</hi> not a <hi>Natural</hi>; a <hi>Cause</hi> without an <hi>Effect</hi>; yea, a kind of <hi>Impotency.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <hi>Proportio Circuitus ad Circuitum, ut temporis ad tempus, quod erat probandum.</hi>

                     <pb n="315" facs="tcp:49861:174"/>Nevertheless, every one of these <hi>Circuits</hi> is reduced to the <hi>half</hi> thereof; because that from the <hi>Opposition,</hi> the <hi>force</hi> of the <hi>Conjunction</hi> is finished, and the <hi>Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition</hi> regarded only.</p>
                  <p>These things understood, it is manifest, that in ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Rule,</hi> what is said of <hi>two Planets,</hi> and <hi>three,</hi> holds also in <hi>four,</hi> and <hi>five,</hi> and <hi>six:</hi> As if <hi>Saturn, Jupiter, Mars,</hi> and the <hi>Moon</hi> shall be joyned <hi>ad unguem,</hi> or within some degrees, you must multiply their <hi>Times</hi> and <hi>Vertues,</hi> as well in respect of the <hi>Magnitude</hi> of the <hi>Effects,</hi> as the <hi>Magnitude</hi> of <hi>Time:</hi> Observing the <hi>first Rule</hi> in the <hi>Times,</hi> the <hi>Second</hi> in their <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues.</hi>

                  <p n="1">1.

                  <p>Every <hi>Star</hi> that hath much Power <hi>per se,</hi> as is the <hi>Rarity</hi> of the <hi>Event,</hi> (for this was but even now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrated) and this <hi>Rarity in gradu,</hi> is always a <hi>Three hundred and sixtieth part:</hi> Therefore if the <hi>Star</hi> be the same, and <hi>Rarity</hi> the same, it is as much to have that <hi>Star</hi> in the degree of the Ascendant (which happens every day, and is called the <hi>Diurne Circuit</hi>) as that the same <hi>Star</hi> should enter the first Point of <hi>Aries.</hi>

of the <hi>Ninth.</hi> For although it happen but <hi>once</hi> in <hi>Thirty six thousand Years</hi>; yet because the <hi>Head</hi> of <hi>Aries</hi> of the <hi>Eighth Sphere</hi> continues in the <hi>first</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of <hi>Aries</hi> in the <hi>Ninth,</hi> and every <hi>Fixed Star</hi> of the <hi>Eighth,</hi> in <hi>one</hi> degree of the <hi>Ninth Sphere,</hi> the space of a <hi>Hundred Years</hi>; 'tis plain, that it is as <hi>Rare</hi> to have the <hi>Head</hi> of <hi>Aries</hi> in the <hi>Ascendant</hi> (whether of the <hi>Eighth</hi> or <hi>Ninth Sphere,</hi>) as that any <hi>one is Born at the time of that Conjunction, viz.</hi> Of the <hi>Head</hi> of the <hi>Eighth Sphere</hi> with the <hi>Head</hi> of the <hi>Ninth,</hi> in the <hi>same Degree.</hi> And so of the rest, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a regard must be had of the <hi>Circuit,</hi> because one <hi>Term</hi> remaineth <hi>Fixed.</hi> The like I prove of <hi>Those</hi> in which the <hi>Terms</hi> are both <hi>moveable</hi>; and as is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest (for Example) in the <hi>Conjunction</hi> of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Jupiter,</hi> which (although it falls out but <hi>once</hi> in <hi>Twenty Years,</hi> yet) remain joyned for the space of the 360<hi>th.</hi> part of the <hi>Circuit</hi>; that is to say, for more than <hi>Twenty Days</hi>; the like of all others.

                  </p>
                  <p>Whence it follows, That even all <hi>Conjunctions</hi> (whether of the Planets amongst themselves, or of the Fixed Stars in respect of the same distance, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose of one Degree, or ten Minutes, or in the very same Minute) are of the same <hi>Vertue</hi> according to their <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi>; yea, and according to their <hi>Power</hi> or <hi>Strength,</hi> in respect of <hi>Rarity</hi>; but yet not in respect of the <hi>Stars</hi> that be in <hi>Conjunction.</hi> For that (as but now was said) the Conjunction of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Jupiter</hi> can do more, than the Conjunction of <hi>Mars</hi> and <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter</hi>; and much more the Conjunction of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Jupiter,</hi> than of <hi>Venus</hi> and <hi>Mercury</hi> in the same di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, in regard of their Bodies.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="319" facs="tcp:49861:176"/>And so likewise the <hi>Conjunction</hi> of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter</hi> in the same degree (be it in what place soever of a <hi>Nativity</hi>) may do more than if <hi>Saturn</hi> or <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter</hi> only were in the degree of the <hi>Ascendant,</hi> or <hi>Mid-heaven,</hi> not of <hi>Rarity</hi>: For as to this they are of equal Power, as was before demonstrated. But for that Reason, that the <hi>Planets</hi> are joyn'd, they do <hi>conduplicate</hi> their <hi>Power</hi> by the <hi>second Rule.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And hence another thing follows, <hi>viz.</hi> That some <hi>Conjunction</hi> of <hi>Venus</hi> and <hi>Mercury</hi> shall be far more Powerful than the <hi>Conjunction</hi> of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Jupiter,</hi> or of the <hi>Sun</hi> and <hi>Moon:</hi> Because the <hi>Conjunction</hi> of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Jupiter,</hi> or of the <hi>Sun</hi> and <hi>Moon,</hi> may be in the <hi>same degree</hi> only, and the <hi>Conjunction</hi> of <hi>Venus</hi> and <hi>Mercury, Corporeal.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I call that a <hi>Corporeal Conjunction,</hi> when the <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets</hi> are not more distant one from another, than the <hi>Aggregate</hi> of their <hi>Semi-diameters</hi>; as <hi>Venus</hi> and <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury</hi> not farther than <hi>Eight</hi> Minutes in <hi>Longitude</hi>; and so <hi>Venus</hi> from the <hi>Moon</hi> not above <hi>Twenty three</hi> Minutes. And if such a <hi>Conjunction</hi> be made also in respect of <hi>Latitude,</hi> it will be far more effectual and valid. Nevertheless the <hi>Latitude</hi> doth not so much as the difference in <hi>Longitude</hi>; because the distance of <hi>Latitude</hi> impedeth not, but that both the <hi>Stars</hi> may be moved in the same <hi>Circle,</hi> passing by the <hi>Poles</hi> of the <hi>Zodiack.</hi> And the greatest distance that can be of <hi>two Planets</hi> in <hi>Latitude,</hi> is betwixt <hi>Mars</hi> and <hi>Venus, viz.</hi> When <hi>Mars</hi> is in the utmost extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of his <hi>Southern Latitude,</hi> and <hi>Venus</hi> in the like of her <hi>Northern Latitude</hi>; for then they are distant fourteen degrees and a half.</p>
                  <p>A Second way, whereby the <hi>Conjunction</hi> of <hi>Venus</hi> and <hi>Mercury</hi> may be greater than the <hi>Conjunction</hi> of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Jupiter</hi> (I omit then what they might be

with some <hi>Fixed Star,</hi> or in the beginning of <hi>Aries,</hi> and with <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Jupiter</hi> in the end of <hi>Virgo,</hi> for that were to multiply the <hi>Conjunction,</hi> and make it <hi>Triple</hi>) as (for Example) this: <hi>Venus</hi> and <hi>Mercury</hi> may be in the <hi>Degree</hi> of the <hi>Ascendant,</hi> and <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Jupiter</hi> in the end of the <hi>second</hi> House: And this by the third <hi>Rule.</hi>
                  </p>

                  <p>The <hi>First,</hi> is the <hi>Conjunction</hi> of the <hi>Ecliptiques</hi> of the <hi>Eighth</hi>) and <hi>Ninth Spheres,</hi> and of the <hi>Heads</hi> of <hi>Aries</hi> thereof; for this excelleth all the rest.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Second,</hi> a <hi>Comet,</hi> which confounds both <hi>Sea</hi> and <hi>Land,</hi> and all things else.</p>

                  <head>Sundry Excellent Rules, shewing by what Laws the Weather is Governed, and how to discover the various Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration of the same.</head>
                  <p>TO Satisfie the Learned and Ingenious part of the World on what grounds we proceed in judging of the Alteration of the Air, and to convince another sort of People, who reflecting on <hi>Marsianus</hi> his Rule, [<hi>Si vis divinare, totum contrarium ad unguem dicito ejus quod Astrologi pollicentur.</hi>] Suppose we do but guess at the Weather, and believe that if they should say Rain, when the Astrologer writes fair and dry Weather; or Calm, when he fore-tells Winds, they should hit the Mark as often as the Astrologer: I will (once for all) hint a few of the many Causes, which either are, or should be considered by all such as aim at Credit or Truth in their Predictions of this kind.</p>
                  <p>First, (then) you must know, that when the Sun (according to appearance) wheels to a Star of a hot Nature, (as to <hi>Mars</hi> or <hi>Jupiter</hi>) it argues a hot or warm disposition of the Air: If to a Star of a cold Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, (as <hi>Saturn</hi> or <hi>Mercury</hi>) a distemper'd Air through the extremity of Cold. And the mutual Conjunction of the Stars that be of one Complexion, augments the same Quality: As the Conjunction of <hi>Jupiter</hi> and <hi>Mars,</hi> by a two-fold vertue of their Heat, make the lower Region of the Air more fervent.</p>
                  <p>Many Planets (especially the Superiour) in Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern Signs, a hot Summer, or a temperate Winter:
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:49861:180"/>
The contrary, when many Planets (the three Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours chiefly) are in Southern Signs: For so they signifie a Cold and Moist Peristasis of the Air, and a colder Winter.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Saturn</hi> in Southern Signs, and especially in <hi>Capri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corn</hi> and <hi>Aquarius,</hi> Terrible Winters of Frost and Cold, Summers remiss in Heat, a Famine, an evil increase of Wine, and of all such Fruits as delight in the Sun.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, when the Cold Nature of <hi>Saturn</hi> is du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicated by the presence of <hi>Mercury,</hi> it makes the) Quality of the Season Colder: But if such a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction or Aspect of the Planets falls out at the New or Full Moon, or at any other Aspect of the Lumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries, the vertue thereof shall appear much more Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually, nay, if within three days preceding a New Moon, it addeth Vigour to the Vertue of such a Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netary Conjunction or Aspect.</p>
                  <p>But when Signs of a contrary Nature be united by commixture of Mutual Aspects, then shall a temperate affection of the Air attend the same. The like you may Judge, if there happen at the same time Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stellations of different Natures, whereof one pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth Frost and Cold, the other Heat; or if one of them bode a Dry Air, the other a Moist, for so of necessity a mean is produced: The Influences of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Constellations mutually impeding and mitiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting one another: As the Conjunction of the <hi>Sun</hi> and <hi>Jupiter,</hi> or <hi>Mars,</hi> (when both in Fiery Signs) brings with it greater Heat, than if one were in a Cold Sign, and the other in a Hot.</p>
                  <p>Furthermore, the Full and New Moons that be Celebrated in Angles (the Horoscope especially, or Angle of the Earth) are usually accompanied with Rain the same Day they happen. But here you must
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:49861:180"/>
Note, That the Effects of the Stars do often-times shew themselves before they come into Partile Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figuration; that is to say, during the time of their Access or Application one to another; and sometimes in their defluxion or separation, which the Ancient <hi>Grecian</hi> Astrologers named <hi>Epichemasin,</hi> and <hi>Proche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>masin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There are some, who (not altogether without Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son) Erect Schemes to the Apparent times of the Conjunctions of the Luminaries: And (having found the Almuten of the Figure, and observed what Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets be Angular) direct the Horoscope of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction (allowing one Day for every thirteen De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, eleven Minutes, the mean Motion of the Moon in one Day:) For, that when the Horoscope comes by such Direction to any Planet that was then Angular, or to the Lord of the Lunation, some Change of Air, to Rain or Snow, or Wind, at least a dark Cloudy Air succeedeth.</p>
                  <p>Consider likewise the Position of the Lord of the Lunation in the Figure, and the Latitude of the Moon, for, from thence come the Winds that occasion Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pests.</p>
                  <p>Take notice also, when the Moon comes w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>hin the Beams of the Lord of the Figure, or the Angular Planets, for then principally does she manifest her self according to the Nature of the Planet.</p>
                  <p>The Conjunction of the Planets with Fixed Stars not far distant from the Ecliptique, produce a Notable Alteration of the Air: And when the Stars leave one Sign, and enter into another, they betoken Showers. Yet still a regard must be had to the Qualities of the Signs and Seasons. As if the Mutation be in a Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try Sign, and in the Winter or Spring, then may Rain or Snow be safely denounced, [Snow in Winter, if
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:49861:181"/>
so be a Cold Peristasis is impending.] The General Rule is, <hi>Grandines in</hi> Aprili <hi>&amp;</hi> Octobri, <hi>Nives in Hyeme, in Aestate Tonitrua.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A special regard must be had to the Nature of the Earth and Air peculiar to the Horizon you live in, or Write for; because that in all places they are not of a like Nature: And no less to the Winds that agree to the particular Season of the Year; for as much as they blow not alike in all places, some being Topi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal and peculiar to one place; others Chronical, which come at a certain time of the Year: Wherefore <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan, Seg.</hi> 7. <hi>Aph.</hi> 29. <hi>Oport<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>In the next place, let the Interval of the Sun, Moon, and Planets be Observed, which consists of the Ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregate of the Sun and Planets Orbs upon the Access or deflux thereof, and especially in the Corporal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction of the Planets: As in the Sun's Application to a Conjunction with <hi>Saturn,</hi> because the Sun's Orb consists of twelve Degrees, and <hi>Saturn</hi>'s of Nine: Therefore so soon as the Sun shall be distant from him, not more than Twenty one Degrees (which Number is produced by the addition of Twelve and Nine Degrees) the Cold commenceth, and lasts for the most part, until the Sun have separated himself Twenty one Degrees from his Conjunction with him.</p>
                  <p>In like manner, the Planets which have their Houses opposite, when they behold one another by a forcible Aspect, as the Opposition, or Quartile, or Trine, do introduce a Memorable Change to Rain, or Cold, or Heat. As, if the Sun be in Aspect with <hi>Saturn,</hi> a Cold Peristasis of the Air, especially if either of them
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:49861:181"/>
be in Watry Signs: In the Summer time frequent showers, but in Winter, Cold and Snow. So also the Configuration of <hi>Mars</hi> and <hi>Venus,</hi> do bring, for the most part, Heat and warm Showers; <hi>Jupiter</hi> and <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury</hi> vehement blasts of Wind. And these Configu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of the Sun with <hi>Saturn, Venus</hi> and <hi>Mars, Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter</hi> and <hi>Mercury,</hi> are (by the Ancient Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticians) called <hi>Portarum seu valvarum Apertiones.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Nor must you neglect the rising and setting of the fifteen Fixed Stars of the First, and the fifteen of the Second Magnitude, Recorded by <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> in his Ka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lendar. For, if upon the Days that those Stars rise or set with the Sun, there be a New or Full Moon Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated, or that some Planet of a Conformable Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture with those Fixed Glories shall rise or set with him, or some other memorable Constellation that Day hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, then may you safely Predict a notable Change of Air. And this is confirmed of <hi>Cardan, Segm.</hi> 7. <hi>Aphor.</hi> 71. <hi>Oportet &amp; exortus &amp; occasus Heliacos cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riorum Syderum observare, vix enim fiet, nè sub Ortu Caniculae siccitatis, morbi non vigeant; &amp; sub Arcturi occasu imbres.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And indeed, unless the rising and setting of the Fixed Stars did Operate something, we should hardly have Rain at one time more than another: For (as saith the same Author, <hi>Seg.</hi> 7. <hi>Aph.</hi> 72.) <hi>Incertus est Planetarum concursus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Observe also, when the Moon, or any of the Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets transits the Angles of the Worlds Revolution, and of the Angles of the New <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>Here we must also Note, that those <hi>Planets</hi> are termed <hi>Benevolent,</hi> in whose <hi>Tubercula,</hi> and places, the accustomed <hi>Lines</hi> are found to be <hi>Equal,</hi> their <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters</hi> fair and proportionable, as a <hi>Cross, Stars,</hi> three or four <hi>parallel Lines, Ladders, little branches,</hi> a <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drangle,</hi> the Character of <hi>Jupiter.</hi> But the <hi>Froward</hi> and <hi>Unfortunate</hi> are those <hi>Planets,</hi> whose <hi>Tubercula</hi> and places are deformed with <hi>troubled Lines,</hi> and <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couth Figures,</hi> as a lame and interrupted <hi>Semi-circle, Grid-irons,</hi> the Character of <hi>Saturn.</hi> And this is to be Observed in all the <hi>Lines</hi> of the Hand.

                     <p>She renders the Body somewhat tall, and clear, the Eyes pleasant, and sparkling with the splendour of Beauty, full of allurement and temptation: The Hair crisped, and very thick, yet gently curling: She in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stills a spotless, and a Noble Mind.

                     <p>But being <hi>Infortunate,</hi> she causeth Lasciviousness, Incontinency, and Boasting: And if you find a <hi>Cross also,</hi> near the first joynt of the Thumb, it commonly designs an Adulterer, or such a one, on whom a mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hap hath fallen in some Uxorious matter, or thing.</p>
                     <p>If the place of <hi>Venus</hi> be untill'd, and void of <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisures,</hi> it points out an effeminate, rude, and sorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Person, Foolishly and Ridiculously addicted to be Merry and Jeasting.</p>

                     <p>If you find a <hi>Saturnine</hi> Particle in the <hi>Cavea</hi> of <hi>Mars,</hi> it threatens a Precipice, or fall from some high Place.</p>

                     <p>These Men are preferred to great Dignities, and solicited by the Conversations of Great Men, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and do highly favour and esteem of their Wives, Sons, honest and good Men, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In a Man <hi>Jupiter</hi> hath the Liver, Blood, and Ribs, the Lungs, and Gristles.</p>

                     <p n="1">1. The <hi>Dominion</hi> of the <hi>Geniture</hi> rests chiefly in <hi>Jupiter</hi> and <hi>Mercury:</hi> Next, in <hi>Venus</hi> and <hi>Mars</hi>; yet not excluding <hi>Saturn</hi> and the <hi>Moon.</hi> The <hi>Rule</hi> for finding and constituting the <hi>Lord</hi> of the <hi>Geniture</hi> shall be explained in our <hi>Astrological Commentaries</hi>: And that we will always follow, and do certainly know we deviate not from the <hi>Truth.</hi> Now, seeing that <hi>Jupiter, Mercury,</hi> the <hi>Moon,</hi> and <hi>Saturn</hi> are all of them <hi>Angular,</hi> it must be of necessity, that these are very conspicuous in their <hi>Mounts. Venus</hi> also, and <hi>Mars</hi> Luxuriate in no <hi>Evil Conjunction.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. This <hi>Geniture</hi> (therefore) is very Fortunate, (except in those things that concern <hi>Health</hi>:) For, <hi>Saturn</hi> is so adverse to <hi>Jupiter</hi> and the <hi>Moon,</hi> that (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most perpetually) he suscitates <hi>Distillations</hi> upon the <hi>Breast</hi> and <hi>Liver.</hi> Herewith agree the Intersected <hi>Lines</hi> in the <hi>Tuberculum</hi> of <hi>Saturn</hi>: Then the <hi>Vital</hi> also and <hi>Epatica</hi> are on every side <hi>Assaulted</hi> by the <hi>Touch</hi> of other small <hi>Lines.</hi> Whence I conclude that the more notable <hi>Assault</hi> of <hi>Diseases</hi> will happen in the 30, 32, 36, 44, and 50<hi>th.</hi> Years of his Age, or thereabout.</p>

                     <p>In the <hi>Geniture</hi> such things as appertain to the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity,</hi> are gathered from the <hi>Positure</hi> of <hi>Mercury,</hi> the <hi>Moon, Saturn,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

                     <p n="7">7. The <hi>Saturnia</hi> drawn to the <hi>Natural Mean,</hi> in a clear Tract, and afterward (by an Obscurer) to the Place of <hi>Saturn,</hi> concerns the happy Issue of things: (<hi>Saturn</hi> is here more adverse to his <hi>Health</hi> than <hi>Outward Fortune</hi>:) And this (in the <hi>Geniture</hi>) may be Collected from <hi>Saturn, Angular</hi>; from the Principal Rule that <hi>Jupiter</hi> and <hi>Mercury</hi> challenge therein, and also from <hi>Venus</hi> and <hi>Mars,</hi> who are joyned in <hi>Pisces</hi>; which <hi>Congress</hi> raiseth not easily to <hi>Fortune.</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p n="9">9. The <hi>Part of Fortune</hi> in the 8<hi>th.</hi> insinuates Goods by <hi>Inheritance,</hi> as also such as flow plentifully from his own Ingenuity and Arts. But yet <hi>Mars</hi> and <hi>Venus</hi> in Opposition thereunto, pronounce a Profuse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness through Pleasures and Luxury.

                  <p>THE World is a <hi>System</hi> of <hi>Celestial</hi> and <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>restrial</hi> Bodies, constant in Order, Number, and Measure, but <hi>Living, Animate, Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectual.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The former Part of the Definition is clear from the Holy Scriptures: The latter is Proved of <hi>Plato,</hi> and that by manifest Reasons.</p>
                  <p>Where we say <hi>A Living System,</hi> we intend a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Natural Life, diffused through the <hi>Bodies</hi> of the World, extended and movably Acting together with the <hi>Body</hi> of the World.</p>
                  <p>Where we call it <hi>An Animate System,</hi> we mean the substance of the <hi>Soul</hi> of the World, whose Essence indeed is both <hi>Indivisible</hi> and <hi>Immutable,</hi> like the <hi>Intellect,</hi> yet it may in some sort be termed <hi>Divisible</hi> and <hi>Movable,</hi> because it is the Proper Fountain of some Powers that are declining to <hi>Divisible</hi> and <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable.</hi> Vertue also (and Action) is partly <hi>Indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual</hi> and <hi>Immovable,</hi> so far forth as it agrees with <hi>Divine</hi> things, stedfastly worketh: And partly
<pb n="645" facs="tcp:49861:340"/>
                     <hi>Divisible</hi> in some Respects, both because it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold, and also for that it declineth to a manifold and <hi>Divisible</hi> Body: And <hi>Movable,</hi> because it worketh <hi>Temporally.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Where we term it <hi>Intellectual,</hi> we mean the <hi>Ange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical Intellects,</hi> which are properly <hi>Perfect</hi> and <hi>Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visible</hi> (according to Place,) in their Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the <hi>Spheres:</hi> And <hi>Immutable</hi> in respect of time, the Natural Life, and Form Corporeal being Opposite thereunto, [<hi>Divisible,</hi> and <hi>Mutable.</hi>]</p>
                  <p>That even these <hi>Angelical Intellects</hi> be in the Body of the World, Necessity requires it, because the Body of the World is through Life made fit for the <hi>Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect.</hi> Therefore look how it is in regard of Life, and the like it is in respect of the <hi>Intellect.</hi> And as it hath not only a Natural lying hid in the Matter of the World, but an Animal also; that is, A Soul existing in it self: So hath it not only an <hi>Intellectual Quality</hi> infused in the Soul, but also an <hi>Intellectual substance</hi> therein remaining. For certain <hi>Qualities</hi> are very where reduced to certain <hi>Substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces:</hi> As a <hi>Vital Quality</hi> to a <hi>Vital Substance</hi>; so also an <hi>Intellectual Quality,</hi> to an <hi>Intellectual Substance.</hi> But as touching these things, we shall explain our self more at large.</p>
                  <p>The whole Body of the World is a certain Body composed of all the <hi>Four Elements,</hi> the Members or Parts whereof are the Bodies of all Living Creatures. For the small Body of every <hi>Animal</hi> is a Part of the Worlds Body: Neither is it composed of the whole <hi>Element</hi> of <hi>Fire, Air, Water,</hi> or <hi>Earth,</hi> but of some parts of these <hi>Elements.</hi> By how much therefore the Whole is more Perfect than a Part thereof; by so much is the Body of the World more Perfect than the Body of any one Living Creature.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="646" facs="tcp:49861:341"/>Hence were it absurd to think, that an Imperfect Body should have a Soul: But that it neither hath a Soul, nor can live Perfect: None will be so mad, as to say, the Part Liveth, and not the Whole. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the whole Body of the World Liveth, whilst the Bodies of the <hi>Animals</hi> therein Live, which are the Parts thereof.</p>
                  <p>And now seeing there must needs be One Soul of the whole World, we will in the next place enquire, in what part thereof this Soul may Reside, whence she distributes her Spirit through all things, and preserves the same so distributed?

                  </p>
                  <p>Moreover, Nature affords it Earth, Water, and Air, as a certain Subject Matter, whereon to Exercise its Power: The Air it self, (as also the Earth, with the Water surrounding it, whence we are Nourish'd, and draw our Breath,) is indeed so Affected of the Fire about it, that sometimes Heat doth therein pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominate; otherwhiles it is so Extenuated, that for want of Heat, it leaves its own Quality, and is forsaken of Cold.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="647" facs="tcp:49861:341"/>In like manner we see such Impressions conveyed from the Fire above us upon the Earth, and Water, that sometimes the Nature and Quality thereof is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of some Excess, otherwhiles of Defect, the <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestial</hi> Fire it self remaining Entire: Wherefore seeing the <hi>Soul</hi> of the <hi>World</hi> hath its Residence in <hi>Heaven,</hi> of Necessity it must live in a Fiery <hi>Substance:</hi> For <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi> is a Fiery <hi>Essence,</hi> but withall most <hi>Temperate, Pure, Lucid,</hi> and <hi>Incorruptible.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Nor shall they trouble us, who deny the Fiery <hi>Heaven,</hi> in regard the Motion of the <hi>Heavens</hi> is <hi>Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular,</hi> the Fires Motion <hi>Perpendicular.</hi> For, because our Fire is <hi>Peregrine,</hi> and <hi>Impure,</hi> therefore it tends directly upwards, and (by a kind of <hi>Veneration</hi>) Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vets the Place of the Proper and Natural Fire; yet is it not to be supposed such a Fiery Hot <hi>Heaven,</hi> as that 'tis Burning or Heating. By how much less Fire is mingled with strange Matter, by so much the less it Burneth: The which is seen in the Flaming of the Purer sort of Oyl, but especially of Oyl Artificiously Extracted from Gold: The which true <hi>Alchymists</hi> do Witness, and as these Mortal Eyes of mine have some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times tryed. Therefore seeing there is not any Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in <hi>Heaven</hi> estranged from the <hi>Celestial,</hi> no <hi>Adustion,</hi> no <hi>Heat</hi> is made there: We see no <hi>Adustion</hi> in <hi>Comets</hi> running through the <hi>Celestial Spheres,</hi> but only some Illustration; for that doubtless the Matter thereof much participateth of the Nature of the <hi>Celestial</hi> Bodies. But <hi>TYCHO-BRAHE,</hi> A <hi>Dane,</hi> A <hi>Noble-Man,</hi> An <hi>Astronomer,</hi> and a most incomparable <hi>Philosopher</hi> of this Age, shall anon more plainly unfold to us this matter far different from the Madded Nursery of <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ripateticks,</hi> and that not without the Infallible Curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity both of Observations and Demonstrations. Now, because some Matter Opposed is Heated and Burnt by
<pb n="648" facs="tcp:49861:342"/>
the <hi>Rays</hi> of the <hi>Sun,</hi> contracted by a <hi>Glass</hi>; that is, a sudden generation of Heat, and Fire, increasing by the Flagration of the Collected <hi>Rays</hi> in the <hi>Glass,</hi> and applyed to fit Matter, which are of another Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation. Some will have the Matter of <hi>Heaven</hi> to be <hi>Aërial</hi>: But for that Light is a Property of Fire, enlightning even the <hi>Air</hi> it self; in my Judgment, we do better, in supposing it to consist of a Fiery Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Besides, <hi>Heaven</hi> is next to the <hi>Divine Seat,</hi> and <hi>God</hi> himself: Yet not so, as that <hi>God</hi> is not every where. <hi>God</hi> is called <hi>The Father of Light,</hi> with whom there is no Change, by whom the <hi>Light</hi> may be Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguished, or Diminished: Neither an over-shadow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Change, whereby sometimes he either is turn'd into <hi>Night,</hi> or suffereth an <hi>Eclipse. GOD</hi> is <hi>Light,</hi> in which there is no <hi>Darkness</hi>; that is, <hi>Form,</hi> wherein there is nothing <hi>Inform</hi>: Beauty, in which there is nothing of Deformity. As therefore <hi>GOD</hi> is Light Invisible, Infinite, the Truth it self, the cause of every truth, and of all things: So the <hi>Light</hi> of <hi>Heaven</hi> is the <hi>splendour,</hi> or rather the <hi>shadow</hi> of <hi>Heaven,</hi> Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, Finite, the cause of visible things: For, the whole Universe receiveth <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Life</hi> from <hi>Heaven. Moses, Aaron, Nadab, Abihu,</hi> and 70 of the <hi>Elders</hi> of <hi>Israel, saw the God of</hi> Israel, <hi>and under his Feet, as it were, a work of Saphire stone, and as the very Heaven when it is clear,</hi> &amp;c. Exod. 24.10. Whence we shall not speak absurdly, if we say that <hi>GOD</hi> shineth upon us by his <hi>Light</hi> from <hi>Heaven,</hi> and the <hi>Sun</hi> as a Candle shineth through Glass, and Windows made thereof: Otherwise, we can hardly explain this matter, because of his Inscrutable Majesty.</p>
                  <p>That therefore the <hi>Celestial Bodies</hi> are <hi>Animate,</hi> is hence rightly concluded: For, it were absurd to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny a Life and Soul to be in Heaven, and the Stars,
<pb n="649" facs="tcp:49861:342"/>
the which Inspire both Life and Soul even in the vilest of these Inferiour Bodies. They give Life unto <hi>Plants,</hi> which grow without Natural Seed, as we see in the Mountains and Places untill'd: So likewise to the Earth: For, if a Lump be taken out of the Bowels thereof,<note rend="inter">The Stars have Life.</note> and for some time exposed to the Rays of the Sun, it yieldeth Grass, or some Herbs, oftentimes the twiggs of little Trees. The Stars also bestow Life upon <hi>Animals</hi> not generated by Copulation: Nor can we be so stupid, as to imagine that <hi>Plants, Trees,</hi> &amp;c. are of a Nobler Condition, than the <hi>Celestial Bodies.</hi> This manifest perpetual Operation cannot come but from a Pure, and Cleansed <hi>Body.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>These things (I suppose) are sufficient to prove, the World hath a Soul, placed in Heaven, as in the most Noble Part thereof.</p>
                  <p>But perhaps you desire it may be further Proved, that these <hi>Celestial Souls</hi> are Rational, and participate of the <hi>Divine Mind.</hi> The Matter is not obscure. For if the World (as <hi>Plato</hi> saith) be the best effect that could be of goodness it self, [That is, of GOD,<note rend="inter">The Stars Rational and Intelligent.</note> for we <hi>Germans</hi> so express it, because (<hi>Got</hi>) sounds nothing else with us than <hi>Gut,</hi> if we rightly enquire the Reason of the Idiom] it must certainly partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate not only of <hi>Life, Sense,</hi> and <hi>Reason,</hi> but also of <hi>Intelligence.</hi> The <hi>Soul</hi> is the Perfection of the <hi>Body.</hi> And that <hi>Body</hi> most Perfect, which hath the Perfectest <hi>Soul.</hi> Wherefore if the <hi>Celestial Bodies</hi> be most Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, they must of necessity enjoy the most Perfect <hi>Souls.</hi> The Heavens therefore do Participate of the Intellect and Mind: Which very thing the <hi>Platonicks</hi> plainly approve by Musical Concords. For, seeing that Musical Concord is, as it were, Living, Rational,

and Effica<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And therefore <hi>Plato</hi> did not amiss, when he Described the <hi>Soul,</hi> to be she that made, preserved, and moved all Natural things, especially by Musical Numbers and Proportion; constituted (I say) by Numbers, not <hi>Mathematical,</hi> as some Calumniate, but by <hi>Ideal</hi> and <hi>Metaphysical</hi> Proportions of Numbers. This Harmony consisteth altogether in Motion,<note rend="inter">Harmony of Heaven consist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in Motion.</note> because that by an <hi>Aërial</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture (posited in Motion) it moveth the <hi>Body:</hi> By a Purified Air, it stirs up the <hi>Aërial</hi> Spirit, (the Chain of <hi>Soul</hi> and <hi>Body</hi>:) By affect it at once disposeth the Sense and Affection: By significa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it Operates upon the Mind. Lastly, through this Motion of the subtil Air, it penetrates vehemently: It floweth sweetly through the Contemplation: And (by its conform Quality) poureth out it self with a wonderful Pleasure. By its Nature, as well Spiritual as Material, it at once Ravisheth, and Claimeth all that is Man. Wherefore let us seriously consider, how the Sounds of most sweet Musick elevate, and, as it were, double and treble our Minds. And in like sort judge the Melody of the <hi>Celestial Bodies,</hi> who now by a slower, but anon by a swifter Motion, produce a tone that is Grave or Acute: Whereunto agree (in these Sublunaries) Gravity and Levity, Cold and Heat, Moisture and Dryness of Elements: So likewise Matter and Form in the G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>very where Free in its own Nature, it might easily
<pb n="651" facs="tcp:49861:343"/>
prevaricate, and wander, unless it were Ruled by the Intellect, and Mind: The which we cannot further enquire of in this Place, according to the Exigence of the Matter.</p>
                  <p>Besides, it is absurd for us to have Reasons of our own works: For the <hi>Celestial Souls,</hi> and so the Soul of the <hi>Universe,</hi> have no Reasons of theirs, of whose Spirit even we our selves are generated, and live con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually.</p>
                  <p>If the <hi>Lesser World</hi> enjoy an Intelligent Soul, such also enjoys the Greater: But we will cease to prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute this any further; concluding, that the World is a <hi>System</hi> of <hi>Cel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Whence we safely gather, that the Soul of the World is a certain singular Life, filling all things, vivifying all things, producing and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necting all things that it may accomplish, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve one Fabrick of the <hi>whole World</hi>; and be as a Monochord sounding out by the three-fold kinds of Creatures, Intellectual, Celestial, and Corruptible, at one Blast, one only Life.</p>

                  <p>Very notable is that place of <hi>Gen.</hi> 37. in the Dream of <hi>Joseph,</hi> who saw himself Worshipped of the <hi>Sun,</hi> the <hi>Moon,</hi> and eleven <hi>Stars,</hi> therefore his Father <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob,</hi> expounding this Dream Magickly, saith, Shall I and thy Mother, and thy Brethren come and Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship thee?

                  <p>But enough of the <hi>Soul of the World.</hi> And now seeing it is manifest the World hath a <hi>Soul,</hi> it will be no less apparent, That the same World shall consist also of a Spirit; which is called the Spirit of the <hi>Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse.</hi> Where the <hi>Soul</hi> is, there also is the Spirit: The <hi>Soul</hi> groans in the Spirit, the Intelligence in the <hi>Soul.</hi> The Spirit also of the Universe, is the vigour of Divine vertues, dilated through all things, whose continual Excitation resides in the <hi>Soul</hi> of the World, and the <hi>Celestial Bodies. Democritus, Pythagoras, Orpheus,</hi> and such others called these Vertues, Gods: <hi>Zoroaster,</hi> Divine Allurements: <hi>Synecius,</hi> Symbolical Inticements: But some called them <hi>Lives,</hi> others also <hi>Souls.</hi> Nor that indeed undeservedly: For seeing the <hi>Soul</hi> is the <hi>Primum Mobile,</hi> and truly of its own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, or by it self movable, but the <hi>Body</hi> or <hi>Matter</hi> of it self Ineffectual for Motion, and much degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating from the <hi>Soul</hi>: Therefore we have need of some more Excellent <hi>Medium</hi>; that is to say, such a <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium,</hi> that may be (as it were) not a <hi>Body,</hi> but yet as if it were a <hi>Soul</hi>; Or as no <hi>Soul,</hi> and yet (as it were) a <hi>Body</hi> whereby the <hi>Soul</hi> may be united to the <hi>Body.</hi> For such a <hi>Medium</hi> is the Spirit of the <hi>Universe</hi> it self, which otherwise we call the <hi>Fifth Essence,</hi> because it is not wholly subsisting of the <hi>Four Elements,</hi> but a certain <hi>Fifth</hi> over and beside them. Therefore such a Spirit is necessarily requisite as a <hi>Medium,</hi> by whose Intervening, the <hi>Celestial Soul</hi> may be in a Grosser <hi>Body</hi>: And this Spirit is of such a Form in the <hi>Body</hi> of the World, as is ours in the Humane <hi>Body:</hi> Because
<pb n="657" facs="tcp:49861:346"/>
that as the Powers of our <hi>Soule,</hi> are by the Spirit communicated to the Members; So the vertue of the <hi>Soul of the World,</hi> is dilated by that <hi>Fifth Essence,</hi> throughout all things; So that nothing can be found in the whole World, which wants a vivifying spark thereof.</p>
                  <p>Through this Spirit every occult Propriety is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagated unto <hi>Herbs, Stones, Metals,</hi> and to all living Creatures, by the <hi>Sun</hi> and <hi>Moon,</hi> by the <hi>Planets</hi> and other <hi>Stars</hi> of the <hi>Eighth Orb.</hi> And those things that contain a more plentiful and excellent Spirit of that Nature, shall perfect a more manifest and swifter Operation in our <hi>Bodies</hi>: if so be it be duly separated from the <hi>Body</hi> and <hi>Feces:</hi> for, the <hi>Feces</hi> profit no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; yea, they plainly Impede and oppress the Pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trating vertue of the Spirit. And indeed all <hi>Physicians</hi> should have a special Regard, that they Artificially se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregate the <hi>Medicinal</hi> vertues of things from the <hi>Body,</hi> and the Elementated Impurities thereof, and not so Foolishly hasten to their Patients, the <hi>Medicines</hi> and <hi>Feces</hi> together. But the most part either wholly omit that Labour, or account it in a manner Dishonest; Leaving that separating Art to the Diseased <hi>Body.</hi> Nevertheless these Men make too huge a Progress in <hi>Philosophy,</hi> they shall often dispute against <hi>Astronomy</hi> it self,<note rend="inter">Herbs more just to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, then Men.</note> not knowing indeed that they can nothing say, or Dispute, without that <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derial Spirit</hi> communicated to them, (as also to every Man, yet more or less,) from above, by the <hi>Heavens</hi> and the <hi>Stars.</hi> Truly the <hi>Lote</hi> (which shutteth its Leaves before <hi>Sun Rise,</hi> but when he Ascendeth openeth them by degrees,) will be accounted more Just and Charitable towards the <hi>Celestial Princes,</hi> then these so Rational Men. And so we believe shall the Cock, who applauds the
<pb n="658" facs="tcp:49861:347"/>
                     <hi>Rising Sun,</hi> as it were with a <hi>Hymn,</hi> from his Inferiour Rousts. But these are from the matter.</p>
                  <p>We formerly told you, There can nothing be found in this Lower World, that wants a vivifying Spark of this Spirit: but yet to know, under what <hi>Star,</hi> and in which Sign of the <hi>Zodiaque,</hi> every thing Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth its Spirit, This is the Work, here the Labour is Nevertheless, there hath so much of this nature been Manifested to us, by sedulous and skilfull Men, as is sufficient for Humane Ingenuity and Pains, to find out greater things. Gold hath in it the Spirit of the <hi>Sun,</hi> and therefore is, (in value,) the most precious of all Metals: It also nourisheth every Spirit of all things Growing: So that the <hi>Sun</hi> possesseth the vertues of all the <hi>Stars.</hi> No marvel then the Spirit of Gold (skilfully extracted, or separated from the elementated, or Metallique <hi>Body</hi>) should extirpate all <hi>Diseases</hi> of the <hi>Body.</hi> The reason is manifest by <hi>Astronomy</hi> it self. But that there is Gold of the <hi>Solar</hi> Spirit, (to omit other Reasons) the purifyed sign thereof sufficiently testifies, where you shall find <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cense Burning</hi> with perpetual Fire: which thing true <hi>Alchymists</hi> know very well; and there yet remains such a thing to be found in some Sepulchres, that hath continued its <hi>Ardour</hi> and <hi>Fire</hi> for more then 100 years; Even as the <hi>Sun</hi> enjoys Perpetual Light. The same Metall is not unfitly called the <hi>Terrene Chaos:</hi> because if the Spirit of the <hi>Universe</hi> residing in it, should at a set time be <hi>reduced</hi> to a competent Form with the <hi>Body,</hi> plainly produces the same, or even greater things, then that Essence of the <hi>Sun,</hi> so earnestly sought for by Covetous Persons. So also to other Metalls, there in a Proper and Perpetual <hi>Seed plot</hi> in <hi>Heaven.</hi> The like for <hi>Trees, Plants, Stones,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>If therefore any thing growing nourisheth in it an
<pb n="659" facs="tcp:49861:347"/>
                     <hi>Astral Spirit,</hi> we account the Incensive matter of the Generative and Seminary vertue much more such, and indeed more Perfect in Man himself. Those <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers</hi> who know not any such thing in Man, can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce nothing certain as touching the Ingenuity of Man, his <hi>Inclinations, Antipathy, Sympathy,</hi> of the <hi>Magnetique</hi> vertue and operation, and such other things as are hitherto appertaining: Whence it is they so Foolishly and Filthily heap up Reasons of <hi>Philosophizing,</hi> which are no better then Volatile Air.</p>
                  <p>We must not forget that there is a twofold Spirit in Man. One infused from the <hi>Heavens</hi> and <hi>Stars,</hi> at the time of Generation: the other Inspired by <hi>GOD</hi>; This was the breathing-hole of Life, in <hi>Adam</hi>; and that indeed Perfect, but afterwards Lost. The First Man was made of the Slime of the Earth, that is, of the <hi>Greater World,</hi> of the Sydereal Creatures and Elements: whence he received a certain <hi>Astral Soul</hi> resembling <hi>the Soul of the World.</hi> The <hi>Object</hi> whereof, is, <hi>The Universal World,</hi> and the things contained therein, that is, Worldly Wisdom, generally comprehending all manner of <hi>Arts</hi> and <hi>Sciences</hi> within it self: some such thing was Anciently called in Man, the Proper <hi>Genius,</hi> or <hi>Demon</hi> of every one. He is not wholly Ignorant of the Natural Law, (that is, of the <hi>Divine Will,</hi> commanding and approving the Good; but A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bominating and Condemning the Evil done unto us) because the World was the <hi>First Image</hi> of God: and Man himself the next <hi>Example</hi> of any thing Possessing the Reason of the Word. And although Man have Free-will, yet so it is in him, that what an one soever the Predestination of the <hi>Mundane Soul</hi> made him; such an one also every Man would (and desireth to) Die, by a natural instinct. Thus we more plainly
<pb n="660" facs="tcp:49861:348"/>
conceive how Man is subject to the <hi>Stars.</hi> Hence likewise we will not deny, but that very many <hi>Diseases,</hi> and consequently the term of Life, proceed (especially in a flourishing Age) from the <hi>Stars,</hi> touching which we have elsewhere produced manifest Reasons, and a manifest Experience in <hi>Examples.</hi> Hereunto belongs the whole <hi>Genethliaque</hi> Part of <hi>Astrology. Theophrastus Paracelsus</hi> hath most Plentifully and Learnedly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained the Foundations of this very Matter, in his Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume of <hi>Wise Philosophy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There was another Breathing Hole <hi>Placed</hi> by God in <hi>Adam,</hi> (beyond this <hi>Rational Spirit,</hi> and operating Soul, deducing its Original and Branches from the <hi>Stars,</hi>) which was the Breathing Hole of Life, in which regard he was said to be the Image of <hi>GOD.</hi> The Beauty of this Image was lost by the Fall of our <hi>First Parents,</hi> (a very small spark thereof surviving in us:) But may be reduced to its pristine Condition by a Regeneration in <hi>Christ.</hi> This <hi>Spark (Christ</hi> being <hi>Mediator</hi>) shall grow into a <hi>Flame</hi> of <hi>Celestial Wisdom</hi>; It is the proper spirit of <hi>those that Believe in Christ,</hi> Joh. 7. <hi>Rejecting, Despising, Deriding all those Worldly things, not as that they are the Works of GOD, for they testifie of GOD what he is, but in that they are Corruptible, unstable, and draw a Man from the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of GOD, and from Eternal Joy in him.</hi> This Wisdom is that sorrow with the Flesh, and its <hi>Concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscences,</hi> at last overcoming, <hi>Christ</hi> being Conquerour. Of this is that vulgar saying, <hi>Sapiens Dominabitur Astris.</hi> A wise Man shall Rule the <hi>Stars.</hi> By this very Rule we are led from the Love of <hi>Corruptible</hi> things, and brought into the Love of <hi>Eternal.</hi> By this <hi>we take the Cross of Christ upon our Shoulders, and Follow him,</hi> that is, <hi>we shall hereby Purge out the Old Leaven, crucifying our Flesh with Evil Affections, and
<pb n="661" facs="tcp:49861:348"/>
Concupiscences, studying to learn abundantly the Fruits of a Christian Spirit, without Hypocrisy,</hi> as <hi>Charity, Faith, Peace, Joy, Liberality, Meekness, Temperance, Gal.</hi> 5. In a word, This <hi>Celestical Spirit</hi> is no other thing, then <hi>Faith</hi> triumphing through <hi>Charity,</hi> without which none shall Prevail before <hi>GOD,</hi> although (as it is in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.) <hi>He should speak with the Tongues of Angels, and had all Faith, so that he could Remove Mountains out of their Places, although he had all Sciences, and knew all Mysteries, though he should give his Body to be Burnt, and were full of Prophesie. GOD is CHARITY:</hi> we were Created and Redeemed of <hi>Charity,</hi> in <hi>Charity,</hi> and by <hi>Charity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Charity</hi> Preserves in us the <hi>Command of GOD. Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi> is the <hi>Bond of Perfection,</hi> Col. 3. <hi>Charity</hi> is <hi>Long suffering</hi> and <hi>Bountiful</hi>: she <hi>Envieth not,</hi> she <hi>maketh no Tumults,</hi> she is not <hi>puft up,</hi> she doth <hi>nothing whereof she is ashamed,</hi> she <hi>seeketh not her own,</hi> she <hi>Provoketh not,</hi> she <hi>thinketh no Evil,</hi> she <hi>rejoyceth not at Iniquity, but the Truth,</hi> she <hi>beareth all things,</hi> she <hi>believeth all things,</hi> she hopeth and <hi>sustaineth all things. Charity Buildeth up, knowledge puffeth up: Charity</hi> is <hi>greater then Prophesies, Sciences, Tongues; Prophesies</hi> shall be <hi>abolished, Tongues</hi> shall be <hi>Silent, Sciences Perish: Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity remaineth for ever.</hi> He <hi>that remaineth in Charity remaineth in GOD, and GOD in him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now we must know, there is a <hi>Two-fold Man</hi>: One <hi>Astral, External</hi> or <hi>Carnal,</hi> which is called <hi>Animal,</hi> (nor perceiveth he the things which are of the <hi>Vivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying Spirit:</hi>) The other <hi>Spiritual</hi> or <hi>Internal,</hi> busied in Renewing the Corrupted <hi>Image</hi> of <hi>God, Rom.</hi> 7. In like manner, there shall be a <hi>Two-fold Wisdom</hi>; One, Worldly or Astral, the Wisdom of <hi>Arts, Sciences, Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, Possessions,</hi> and of Curruptible things, wherein the <hi>Gentiles</hi> are alone Busied, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. The other
<pb n="662" facs="tcp:49861:349"/>
                     <hi>Celestial,</hi> consisting in the knowledge of GOD, in the consideration of his <hi>Ineffable Mercy,</hi> in the desire of <hi>Eternal Happiness.</hi> This Wisdom acknowledges no other Governour, than the <hi>Holy Spirit,</hi> Operating by the Word of <hi>GOD:</hi> That, the <hi>Heavens</hi> and <hi>Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stial Influences</hi>: Both which may be joyned in a <hi>Man</hi> that pleaseth <hi>GOD.</hi> But in whom the <hi>Celestial</hi> Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom Reigneth, that other is only a Hand-maid; she seeks for nothing at all, but the Glory of <hi>GOD,</hi> and the welfare of her Neighbour: which indeed is as much as is granted in this Life to the <hi>Elect,</hi> or those whom the <hi>Father</hi> hath given unto <hi>Christ.</hi> Now, where the <hi>Astral</hi> Reigneth, (suppose that alone,) <hi>There are Dogs, and Swine, unto whom we are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden to cast Pearls, or that which is Holy.</hi> Lastly, where the <hi>Celestial</hi> and <hi>Astral</hi> do Conjunctly Rule; that is, <hi>when we endeavour to serve Two Masters,</hi> There is true <hi>Hyprocrisie,</hi> very displeasing unto <hi>GOD. No Man can serve Two Masters:</hi> Such were the <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risees</hi> in the time of <hi>Christ,</hi> whose Righteousness if ours exceed not, <hi>we shall not enter into the Kingdom of God; Christ</hi> himself hath spoken it.</p>
                  <p>It was but requisite that we a little touched upon those things, lest Ignorant Detractors, (who are either far out of the way, or abhor this True manner of <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophizing</hi>) should take occasion to mingle <hi>Holy</hi> things with <hi>Profane,</hi> or <hi>Profane</hi> with <hi>Holy,</hi> whilst per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps they might take upon them to Disprove these Realities.</p>
                  <p>Furthermore, as hitherto we have Treated of the <hi>Soul</hi> and <hi>Spirit of the Universe,</hi> and of the <hi>Sydereal Governour in Man:</hi> So now we may possibly be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed concerning <hi>Four Senses</hi> in the <hi>Universe,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodating themselves to the <hi>Four-fold Vertue</hi> or <hi>Power of the Soul of the World.</hi>

                     <pb n="663" facs="tcp:49861:349"/>There are <hi>Four Elements</hi> which contribute Matter to the <hi>Body</hi> of the <hi>World</hi>: And there are also <hi>Four Powers</hi> in the <hi>Soul</hi> of the <hi>World.</hi> The first is, the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellect,</hi> of it self Immovable, the Mover or Governour of the <hi>Sphere</hi>; Instituted by the <hi>Author</hi> of all things <hi>Governing</hi> the <hi>Spheres.</hi> The second is, the <hi>Soul</hi> of the <hi>Sphere,</hi> A <hi>Mover</hi> indeed that is Movable, yet so of it self.

one manner or other described in the Hand it self.

                  </p>
                  <p>But if you desire to know wherefore these <hi>Signa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures</hi> are found in the <hi>Hand,</hi> and perhaps not in any other <hi>Part</hi> of the <hi>Body,</hi> you must conceive, that our <hi>Hands</hi> are the most <hi>Noble Members</hi> in perfecting of all manner of <hi>Actions</hi>; they are the <hi>Executors</hi> of all our <hi>Primary Conceptions:</hi> Insomuch, that if we wanted the Benefit of our <hi>Hands</hi> for a few days, it must needs be we should all of us Perish together: That there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our <hi>Fate</hi> for the most part, and our <hi>Power</hi> are very much reposed in our <hi>Hands,</hi> we (even not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it) openly testifie, when with closed <hi>Hands,</hi> we make them Petitioners to <hi>GOD,</hi> or any Man, truly declaring, we can do nothing of our own strength; we despise and reject these Flaggs of our Fate, folded up (like those of War) and yet that one thing which we humbly crave, they obtain and make good unto us, as if some Sacrament were interposed betwixt them. I know not of whom such things as these may seriously be considered on, in their Prayers.</p>
                  <p>It may now be Asked, wherefore the Excellent Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>situres of the <hi>Stars,</hi> do not always shape and depaint the <hi>Lines</hi> very clear in our <hi>Hands?</hi> I have seen a No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Man, in whose <hi>Geniture</hi> all the <hi>Seven Planets</hi> were Collocated in their Dignities; yet were not the <hi>Lines</hi> perspicuous in the most parts of his <hi>Hands,</hi> but rather Obscure. I have seen another Nobly Descended, in whose Nativity <hi>Mercury</hi> was Excellently well Posited in <hi>Gemini,</hi> and in the Cuspe of the Tenth: Yet the

Now, how the Power and Dominion of this <hi>Star,</hi> then so strong and Powerful, should be thus Impedited, is the Qu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>It may be again Demanded, how it comes, that sometimes you find a Diversity of the <hi>Principal Lines</hi> in both Hands? I have seen the <hi>Epatica</hi> of the <hi>Right Hand,</hi> adhering in some to the <hi>Line of Life</hi>; but in the <hi>Left Hand</hi> the same Remote from the <hi>Vital</hi> by a notable space: Which we have also mentioned some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where else in our <hi>Practick</hi> part.</p>
                  <p>Touching these, we must know, that many times the Seed of the Parents proves a great Impediment to the Superiour Commotions. For indeed the Seed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth one Condition from Parents that live in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, and Temperately; but another from such as live in Discord and Anxieties; especially about the time of Conception. Besides, there is in either Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent a certain Pattern of the Imagination of the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crocosm,</hi> both of them receiving from every part there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of sundry Impressions: And therefore when the Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination of the <hi>Greater World</hi> is one way affected about the Conception, and the Fathers and Mothers another way, it must needs be that some Discrepancy will hence arise. But the Impression of the Mothers Imagination is vulgarly known (as much as may be) at the time of the Birth. The finding out of all Causes, is very Abstruse. Nevertheless as touching those who have the <hi>Lines</hi> of either <hi>Hand</hi>
                     <pb n="670" facs="tcp:49861:353"/>
appearing with a different Face, we cannot otherwise appoint and Pronounce, but that such are disposed and inclined to a double Fortune, Good and Bad.</p>
                  <p>And now at length being about to put a Period to this our <hi>Tract</hi>; we earnestly desire all <hi>Learned Men,</hi> that whatsoever they know in <hi>Chiromancy,</hi> as having made some certain Tryal thereof, they will be pleased freely to contribute the same to these our Endeavours.</p>
                  <p>I confess I have not every where in my <hi>Praxis</hi> sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied my own self: I know what Experience I have need of, to Compleat an Absolute <hi>Praxis</hi>: And other Men also may know I have Assay'd to dig at some such thing. It had been requisite to have annexed somewhat of <hi>The Soul of the World,</hi> and of what ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaineth thereunto, as well lest some should Rashly Proclaim <hi>Incertain things to be Explained and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by Incertain</hi>: As also that we might in some sort Admonish both the Ignorant, and likewise such as Deride the Lethargy of the <hi>Celestial</hi> (in these <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rene) Bodies,</hi> comprehending much in a few words, from which Beginning, there may be Degrees of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming these truly sincere things in <hi>Philosophy.</hi> Thanks be to <hi>GOD,</hi> that it is not estrang'd from the Holy <hi>Scriptures:</hi> See the <hi>Book of Wisdom,</hi> Chap. 7. &amp; 13. wherein the <hi>Lethargy</hi> of <hi>Celestial</hi> things is separated from these Inferiours, lest they should Feed on the <hi>Tares</hi> of <hi>Philosophy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I shall be perswaded, it is possible, That the <hi>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> and <hi>Ingenious</hi> may Favour this my First Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours. If otherwise, it sufficeth me that I received a Sober Censure, at least amongst those <hi>Wise</hi> and <hi>Learned Men,</hi> to whom I presented this in writing: Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless there be some of that Profession, who suppose it otherwise. I have nothing to do with the <hi>Ignorant</hi> and <hi>Malevolent.</hi>
