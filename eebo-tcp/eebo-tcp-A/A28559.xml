            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

NON-RESISTANCE, or PASSIVE OBEDIENCE,
No way concern'd in the
CONTROVERSIES now depending, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>I Have with ſome impatience and wonder beheld the bandying
of the <hi>Non-reſiſting Doctrine</hi> to and fro in this diſturbed
Kingdom, for ſo many Months, and to ſo little purpoſe; becauſe
I am not able to comprehend what any of the contending Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
would be at, nor why that Doctrine, rather than any other,
ſhould be made now the Subject of our Diſquiſitions and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries.</p>
            <p>For what if God has forbidden us upon pain of Damnation, to
reſiſt our Lawful Princes when they do amiſs; and has reſerved to
himſelf the Cenſure and Puniſhment of his own Miniſters, as I'be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
all Lawful Princes are ſuch; and that God has for great and
wiſe Reaſons tied up our hands; Doth it therefore follow from
hence, that <hi>James</hi> is ſtill the Lawful King of <hi>England?</hi> Or that when
he was ſo, we that believe the Non-reſiſting Doctrine, were bound
to ſight for him, whatever he did?</p>
            <p>And on the other ſide, what can the Friends of their preſent Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties
pretend to palliate their Contempt and Scorn of the Doctrine
of <hi>Paſſive Obedience?</hi> It was indeed dangerous to them when he
firſt entered <hi>England,</hi> becauſe all that believed themſelves bound by
it, were obliged not to take up Arms for him againſt King <hi>James;</hi>
and ſo conſequently it deprived him of their Aſſiſtance: But when
he had once ſubdued the Forces, and obtained the Throne of that
Infatuated Monarch; of what uſe can it be to him to have his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
ſo frequently told, That it is lawful for them to take Arms and
Defend themſelves, their Rights and Religions againſt him? I doubt
not but His Majeſty intends to Govern us with the utmoſt Clemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
and Mercy according to our Laws: But when neither <hi>Moſes</hi> nor
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:61155:3"/>
               <hi>David</hi> could always pleaſe their Subjects; It is to be feared the beſt
of Princes may at one time or other need the Influence of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of Paſſive Obedience to reſtrain the <hi>madneſs of the People:</hi> and
therefore they can be no Friends to Government in general; nor
to him, or his, in particular, who are ſo zealous to have the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of Non-reſiſtance extirpated out of the World. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence
of which, is, That it is Lawful <hi>for every Man to Rebel
againſt his Lawful Prince, whenever he think<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> it neceſſary.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>My deſign therefore in this Diſcourſe being to put an end, as far
as I can, to this unſeaſonable Diſpute. I ſhall endeavour to prove
theſe Particulars, as to the Friends of the late King.</p>
            <p>1. That th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſe that believed it, were not thereby bound to aſſert
the Miſ government of <hi>James</hi> the Second.</p>
            <p>2. That ſeeing he has deſerted his Throne, and withdrawn his
Perſon and Seals, they are not thereby obliged to endeavour the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoring of him.</p>
            <p>The Doctrine of Paſſive Obedience doth not oblige a Subject
to aſſert the Miſ-government of his Prince: For it ſuppoſeth the
Prince may command what he ought not, and then it obligeth me
to ſuffer rather than to reſiſt my Prince, or to break the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of God, or the Laws of my Country, or do any other ill
Action in Obedience to his Commands. Now what is this to the
purpoſe? King <hi>James</hi> had notoriouſly ſubverted all our Conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and Laws, both in Church and State, and would ſuffer no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs;
the Church of <hi>England,</hi> on the other hand, Petition'd him
from time to time by her Biſhops and Nobility, to ſuffer a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to meet and redreſs our Grievances; but this he would not
yield, and what ſhould they do in this caſe?</p>
            <p>Why, ſaid the Jeſuit, in the Anſwer to the Petition of the 17<hi>th</hi> of
<hi>November,</hi> 1688. (when they had ſet forth, That <hi>in their Opinion
the <hi>Only</hi> viſible way to preſerve his Majeſty and this his Kingdom,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Hiſtory of the Deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, p. 48.</note>
               <hi>would be the calling of a Parliament Regular and Free in all its
circumſtances.</hi>) <q>I hope to make it out, that the ſummoning a Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament
now, is ſo far from being the <hi>Only</hi> way to effect theſe
things, that it will be <hi>one</hi> of the Principal Cauſes of much Miſery
to the Kingdom. <hi>And,</hi> I am ſure, <hi>both our Duty to God and our holy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
as well as to His Majeſty and our Country,</hi> doth plainly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn
us to uſe <hi>one</hi> other effectual means, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which is the keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
inviolably to our Allegiance to our Sovereign; and effectually
joyning with him to reſiſt all his Enemies Whether Foreign Aggreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors,
or Native Rebels.</q> That is, let the King do what he pleaſe
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:61155:3"/>
to you, you are bound to fight for him and expel the Prince of
<hi>Orange,</hi> and ſubdue all his Adherents.</p>
            <p>I can very well remember what ſmall effect this Oratory had then
upon the minds of all Men. There did not ſeem to be one Proteſtant in
the Nation, who could not diſtinguiſh between the Doctrine of Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſiſtance
and that of actually aiding a Prince to deſtroy and enſlave
his People. His late Majeſty however perſiſted in his Opinion, that no
Parliament could be holden till the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> was driven out;
and the Clergy and Nobility in theirs, that this was the <hi>Only
viſible way</hi> to preſerve the late King and Kingdom: which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd,
that all fighting was dangerous to both, till this was done.
And accordingly, as we had no diſloyal Exhortations from Preſs or
Pulpit to perſwade Men to fight againſt their Prince; ſo neither
had we any to perſwade us to fight for him: but the thing was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to God to determine as he thought fit.</p>
            <p>In this our Biſhops, Clergy, Nobility and Gentry; and in general
all the Children of the Church of <hi>England</hi> behaved themſelves like
good Chriſtians and good Subjects too; this difficult Caſe could then
be no otherwiſe well and juſtifiably managed; and if ſome few for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got
their Duty, and declared too ſoon for the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi>
his now Majeſty; this they only are reſponſible for; thoſe that ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hered
to the late King till he actually left the Nation and the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
fell for want of the firſt Mover, are not reſponſible for
their Miſcarriage if it was one.</p>
            <p>In the Primitive times, when this Doctrine was beſt both under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
and practiſed, their Loyalty was one of their leſſer Virtues,
upon which they never valued themſelves. It would have been then
a mean piece of Virtue for a Man to have alledged he had been
ever Loyal to his Prince, when a Rebel or a Traytor Chriſtian
was a thing they looked upon with horror and affrightment; they
expected Martyrdom every moment, and were preparing for it at all
times; they were told then, at their firſt admiſſion into the Church,
that they muſt expect Perſecution, and every one who took up that
Profeſſion, did it with that Expectation: And the Religion being
contrary to the Eſtabliſhed Laws, whoever came in to it, knew
beforehand that at one time or other he might be called to lay down
his Life for it, and when it happened, it was no new or unexpected
accident, but foreſeen and provided for.</p>
            <p>But then they were not ſo ſilly as to be fond of their Perſecutors,
or to wiſh or fight for it:<note place="margin">Ad Scapu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lam c. 2.</note>

take up Arms, limited the Grant to times of <hi>Peace;</hi> which was all
one with the ſaying, They would not allow it under Pagan Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
From all which I may reaſonably infer, They did not think
themſelves bound to beſtir themſelves for Pagan or perſecuting
Princes, as if the Church muſt have periſhed, if they had not had
the Honour to preſerve every Prince God had ſet over them till he
had ended his Reign and his Life together.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:61155:4"/>
Yet in all theſe times the Doctrine of Paſſive Obedience was at
the Higheſt never call'd in queſtion, never doubted of. It is as true
alſo, The Roman Emperors, under whom they lived, were abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
Independent Princes, whoſe Will was the Law; and the conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution
of the Empire differed vaſtly from that of <hi>England.</hi> So that
we are not under the ſame Obligations they were, becauſe our
Princes have not the ſame Legal Powers the Roman Emperors had:
but then, I doubt not, but we are as much bound to ſubmit to the
Legal Commands of a King of <hi>England,</hi> as the Primitive Chriſtians
were to the Legal Commands of their Princes. But this was no part
of the Controverſie under the Reign of <hi>James</hi> II. who had as little
Law as Reaſon for what he did.</p>
            <p>I could never meet with one ſingle Proteſtant, how diſcontented
ſoever he was, that <hi>James</hi> II. is not ſtill King of <hi>England,</hi> who would
pretend to juſtifie or excuſe any of his Actions; no, they all grant
his Deſign was certainly to extirpate the Proteſtant Religion, to
enſlave, and conſequently to extirpate the Engliſh Nation: but
then ſay they, What of all that, <hi>no evil is to be done;</hi> we ought not
to rebel to ſave a Church or a Nation.</p>
            <p>Why, what then? ſuppoſing all this were true, What is this to
them? Have any of them rebelled? Yes, ſay they, all that have
ſworn Allegiance to their preſent Majeſties, have made defection
from <hi>James</hi> II. who tho' he were never ſo bad a Man, is ſtill our law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Prince, and we are bound to ſwear Allegiance to no other, as
long as he is alive.</p>
            <p>To this I reply, If the things laid to the Charge of <hi>James</hi> II. in
the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi>'s Declaration, are true, and I think no body
queſtions that, for all the ſame things, in a manner, are complained
of in the Biſhops Propoſals, but one or two, which were too high
for any Subject to take notice of; why then, I ſay, That Prince had
a juſt Cauſe to make War upon <hi>James</hi> II. and if he was conquered
by him, he has as good Right to our Allegiance, on that ſcore, as
ever any conquering Prince had.</p>
            <p>But this is not all, It is well known, His now Majeſty offered to
ſubmit all his Controverſies to the Deciſion of an Engliſh Parliament,
which is more, perhaps, than was ever done by any invading Prince
before; but <hi>James</hi> II. was reſolved, That neither he nor we ſhould
have any Right or Redreſs; but rather than ſubmit to that, he would
go make a Voyage to his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty for his Aſſiſtance to
make a ſecond Conqueſt of us.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:61155:5"/>
There has been much bandying, Whether <hi>James</hi> II. went volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily
away, or were forced; and this is a Queſtion not worth one
Farthing, at the bottom. For if he went voluntarily, he was forced;
and if he was forced, he went voluntarily.</p>
            <p>I ſuppoſe no Man ever ſaid or thought he freely reſigned the
Crown, but that his Miſ-government had raiſed ſuch Jealouſies and
Diſcontents in the Minds of his Subject, that they neither could nor
would fight for him till he had in Parliament done Right, firſt to
his People, and then to the Prince. This he was reſolved not to
grant, be the Event what it would; and when he ſaw himſelf de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted
by all the World, ſtill he perſiſted in his Reſolution; and
after he had promiſed a Parliament, broke his Word with the Prince
and the Nation, and withdrew his Perſon and Seals, and left us in
Anarchy and Confuſion. Now, I ſay, he was not forced to do this:
he might, and as the caſe ſtood, he was bound to have granted
a Parliament, and then he might have ſtaid with good ſafety to his
Perſon and Sovereignty.</p>
            <p>Now, if there be nothing asked of a Prince by his Neighbour-Prince
upon an Invaſion, but what he ought to grant and may grant;
he is forced by no body but himſelf, if he will run away from his
People, rather than do them and his Neighbour Right.</p>
            <p>But then, when we ſay, His retreat was voluntary, we do not
pretend there was no force made uſe of, but that it was not made
uſe of to that end. All that was asked by the Prince or his own
Subjects, was a free and legal Parliament; and all the force that was
uſed was to that End: And this he might and ought to have granted;
but if he would not, the Prince is not to be ſuppoſed to have brought
14000 Men, only to make a vain Shew with all, but either to force
him to do him Right, or force him out of his Kingdom.</p>
            <p>This Prince was no Subject to King <hi>James,</hi> nor to any other
Prince, and conſequently was no Rebel: He had as well good Right
as a good Cauſe to invade this injurious Prince who had injured both
him and his good Subjects, and without a War would do no right
either to the Prince or us. For the Prince had tried all fair waies
before he tried Force, as is notoriouſly known to all the World.</p>
            <p>But our <hi>Jacobites</hi> prate of the Force that was uſed againſt him by
another Sovereign Prince, as injurious, only becauſe it was Force.
Why, the Prince was no Subject, and if <hi>James</hi> II. would do him
no right without Force (tho' we that were then his Subjects had no
Right to compel him) HE might lawfully compel him by Force to
do what he ought to have done without it, but would not.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:61155:5"/>
What Stupidity is it to deny a Sovereign Prince may make uſe of
Force againſt a neighbouring Prince that has done him Wrong?</p>
            <p>Well, but ſay they, His Subjects ought to have fought for King
<hi>James:</hi> To which I ſay, Why did they not, who hindred them from
fighting? No, they would not fight, or, which is all one, they
durſt not; and now he is gone, they think to make him amends, by
a fullen diſclaiming of the preſent King's Sovereignty.</p>
            <p>But tho' they will not ſwear, they will promiſe to live peaceably
under this King: That is, they will not own him for the lawful
King of <hi>England,</hi> but they will ſubmit to him as they did to <hi>Oliver
Cromwel,</hi> till they have an Opportunity to dethrone him, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver
him into the Hand of King <hi>James;</hi> and for this they would be
allowed the ſame Condition with thoſe Subjects that have ſworn
Allegiance to him. Is this reaſonable? will they admit a Servant
or a Rival on the ſame Terms into their own Families?</p>
            <p>Well but ſome of his Subjects forſook, and others of them fought
againſt him, and almoſt all the reſt ſtood ſtill, and would not fight
for him. 1. What is this to them, if they have done as much for
him as they could or ought, they ſhall anſwer for no body but
themſelves. 2. What was the Reaſon, and who gave the Cauſe
of this general Deſertion? 3. It is denied that King <hi>James</hi> his
Subjects were bound to ſtand by him and fight for him. He had
notoriouſly invaded and deſtroyed all our Civil and Religious Rights
and Liberties, and deſigned the Ruine and Deſtruction both of
them and us, and would give us no Aſſurance, we could rely on,
to do otherwiſe for the future; and therefore if it were unlawful to
reſiſt him, it was alſo as unlawful to aſſiſt and enable him to deſtroy
the true Religion, the Engliſh Liberties and Immunities; nay the
very Nation.</p>
            <p>Now <hi>Jovian</hi> tells us, pag. 272. <q>Whoſoever acts contrary to
Law, in this Realm, to the Prejudice of any other Perſon, muſt
be ſubject to make Reparation by Law; <hi>againſt which the King
himſelf can protect no Man, as long as the Courts of Law are kept open;</hi>
               </q>
(this has been ſufficiently confuted) <q>ſo that there can be no Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny,
nor any Perſecution, but a moſt exorbitant and illegal Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution,
which muſt preſuppoſe, That Juſtice is obſtructed, the
Laws and Lawyers ſilenced, the Courts of Judicature that up,
and that the King governs altogether by Arbitrary Power and the
Sword.</q> (The Courts were indeed open, but we know for all
that, no Man could have any redreſs; but the Conſequences were
the ſame as if they had been ſhut up.) <q>But to ſuppoſe this</q> (ſaith
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:61155:6"/>
the Doctor) <q>is plainly to ſuppoſe the utmoſt poſſibility, which
is next to an impoſſibility, a poſſibility indeed in Theory, but ſcarce
to the reduced into Practice, <hi>For in ſuch a violent <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ndertaking all
good Men would withdraw from the Service and Aſſiſtance of the King;</hi>
               </q>
(mark that) <q>
                  <hi>and the Bad durſt not ſerve him, becauſe if he died, or
repented of his <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ndertaking, they muſt be anſwerable for all the Wrongs
and Illegalities they were guilty of in his Service.</hi>
               </q> And a little lower
he tells us, <q>To ſhut up the Laws or obſtruct and pervert Juſtice,
would prove an exceeding difficult and almoſt impracticable Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking,
<hi>becauſe</hi> all his good Subjects, and all the bad too, that
tendered their own Safety, would deſert him; nay Foreigners,
upon this account, would make a Difficulty to ſerve him, becauſe
he could not protect them againſt his own Laws.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Now all this was done and averred in the Face of the Sun, this
Poſſibility was brought into act, and things driven on to the utmoſt
Extremity; and the only Queſtion then was, Whether we ſhould
intail this arbitrary tyrannical exorbitant Perſecution on our Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
without any Hopes or Poſſibility of Redreſs, or whether we
ſhould withdraw from his Service, and ſecure our Rights and
Religion by it? And this was done by all but the Iriſh and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts,
both Good and Bad, in a manner, as the Doctor foretold it
would; and to me it ſeems altogether juſtifiable. I know the Doctor
means only a Civil Receſs; but if it was highly puniſhable and
Infamous to have perſiſted in a co-operation and Aſſiſtance of
theſe things, it was worſe and more puniſhable to have fought for
them.</p>
            <p>And from hence I conclude, All that did withdraw from the
Service of the late King, when they ſaw he was reſolved on theſe
illegal exorbitant Courſes, are not to be blamed; and that the beſt
of the Primitive Chriſtians would have done the ſame thing, if it
had been their lot to have fallen under ſuch a Prince.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tertullian, de corona, c.</hi> 12. expounds that Place of Scripture,
<hi>Give unto Caeſar the things that are Caeſar's, and unto God the things that
are God's. Give the Man to God, and the Penny to Caeſar.</hi> The Man
bore God's Image, as the Penny did <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s; and when God and
<hi>Caeſar</hi> were in oppoſition, the whole Man was God's Right. So far
were they from thinking, their Loyalty to their Prince obliged them
to be diſloyal to their Religion, even then when they never thought
of Reſiſting, their hands were tyed up neither to aſſiſt nor reſiſt a
againſt perſecuting Prince, they would do neither of theſe tho' they
(periſhed. And are not we ſtill under the ſame Obligations as to
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:61155:6"/>
the latter as well as to the former? For Shame, let no Man boaſt
of that Loyalty to his Prince, which makes him Diſloyal to God and
his Church, to whom his Duty is firſt owing; for in this Caſe it is
our undoubted Duty, <hi>to obey God rather than Man. Art thou then</hi>
(ſaith <hi>Tertullian) a Servant and Soldier to two, to God and Caeſar too;
certainly thou wilt not be for Caeſar when thou oweſt thy Service to God:
even in common things, I yield to the better: or I believe thou wilt be
for the better.</hi> So far were they then from valuing themſelves upon
the ſcore of their Loyalty to their Prince.</p>
            <p>The Diſloyalty of two other Parties have made the Church of
<hi>England</hi> take into the contrary Extreme; and as a Jeſuit <hi>wiſhed it
might do her much good,</hi> in Scorn: So ſhe had like to have paid too
dear for the Pretence; and they that would now again ſacrifice
her to their Intereſt and Reputation, are, to ſpeak ſoftly, none of
her beſt Friends.</p>
            <p>They pretend we have not ſuffered enough for our Religion, to
juſtifie our Reſiſtance? Why, according to their Principles we are
never to reſiſt, whatever we ſuffer, but to ſuffer on till there is not
one Man left to reſiſt. Now did ever any Man, before they,
complain, That <hi>for the Elect's ſake God had ſhortned thoſe. Daies<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi>
If they think we have not ſuffered enough for our Religion, they
may be pleaſed to go for <hi>France</hi> or <hi>Ireland</hi> and there make up
what is wanting: But if they love Company, and would needs
have us ſuffer with them too, I do not underſtand the Favour. If
they are Prodigal of their own Lives and Fortunes in this World,
they ought to be tender of other Men's; <hi>Cruces nec colimus, nec
optamus; We neither worſhip nor wiſh for Croſſes,</hi> ſaid <hi>Octavius,</hi> a Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive
Chriſtian: And it is madneſs to deſire to be, and to bring
others into affliction and Trouble, when God doth not willingly
afflict or grieve the Children of Men, and hath ſent us a Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
before we expected it, and ſooner than ſome Men are well-pleaſed.</p>
            <p>They have another Objection, which is full as extravagant as
this; If, ſay they, King <hi>William</hi> has conquered King <hi>James,</hi> why
doth he not claim the Crown by Conqueſt? Why, he that has ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Rights to the ſame thing, may uſe his beſt, and wave the reſt.

<pb n="10" facs="tcp:61155:7"/>
him claim as a Conqueror, that they might thence take occaſion
to ruine him; but he has the Right of a Conqueror, and the Right
of a Lawful Succeſſor too; and tho' his own perſonal Right of Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion
is more remote, that of his Lady is immediate; and by it
be claims, to our great Good, and his immortal Honour: And
they, in the mean time, might, if they pleaſed, be as ſatisfied in
the Right he has by conqueſt, as the <hi>Saxons</hi> were, when King
<hi>William</hi> I. won the Crown in a Battle, and wore it, under the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of an Election, becauſe he could lay no Claim to it by Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion:
And <hi>Henry.</hi> VII. twiſted his Right by Conqueſt with his
Deſcent from <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> and his Right by Marriage. But theſe
Men ſeem not to care which way our Ruine come, if we may but
be miſerable; we have not ſuffered enough under King <hi>James,</hi>
but he, too, would fain come in by Conqueſt; and if ever he get
the Crown again that way, theſe Gentlemen will have no reaſon to
complain of the Want of Sufferings.</p>
            <p>Tertullian, <hi>who wrote his Apology for the Chriſtians, in or
about the Year of Chriſt CC. as</hi> Pamelius <hi>ſtateth the Time, in his
Annals of the Life of that Father, ſaith in his firſt Apology, c.</hi> 37.
If we Chriſtians would become your publick and declared Enemies, or
ſecret Revengers of our own Wrongs, ſhould we want Force and number
to ſupport it? We exceed the <hi>Moors,</hi> the <hi>Marcomans,</hi> and the <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians,</hi>
or any other one ſingle Nation in the whole World; we are but of
Yeſterday, and yet we have filled all your Places, your Cities, your
Iſlands, Caſtles, Corporations, Councils, Tribes, Companies, Palace,
Senate and Forum or Market-Place; and we have left you nothing to
enjoy alone but your Temples; now we who ſo willingly lay down our
Lives, are we not thereby fitted and prepared, do you think, to manage
any War, tho' we were very much inferior in Number; if our Religion
did not oblige us, rather to ſuffer Death than to inflict it? we might
without Arms or Reſiſtance, barely by diſagreeing with you, and the
Envy of a Separation, very much endager and diſquiet you; for if ſo
great a part of the Empire, as we now make, ſhould break it ſelf off from
the reſt, and retire into any remote Corner of the World, it would cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
confound your Dominions, to loſe ſo many Subjects, be their Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
what it will; yea, our very departure from you would be a ſevere
Puniſhment; the Deſolation and Silence we ſhould leave behind us, would
ſtrike you with an Horror and Amazement, as if the World were expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring;
you would be forced to ſeek for new Subjects to ſupply our Places;
and perhaps we ſhould leave you more Enemies than Subjects or Defenders.
<hi>This Place has been often cited to prove the Doctrine of Paſſive
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:61155:7"/>
Obedience; and in truth it is a noble Teſtimony of the Faith and
Patience of thoſe Saints: But then the Church continued after this
under Pagan and Perſecuting Princes one hundred and ten years, and
ſomething more, in which ſhort time there is reckoned about twenty
nine Emperors; their times being ſhort, and their ends Bloody;
they almoſt all of them perſhing by the Sword. Did any of the
Primitive Chriſtians in thoſe days make any ſcruple to ſubmit
to the prevailing Power?</hi> The ſame <hi>Author, in this very Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy,
puts the Queſtion to the Pagans,</hi> 
               <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nde Caſſii, Nigri, &amp;
Albini, &amp;c. De Romanis (niſi fallor) id eſt, de non Chriſtanis.
From whence are all your <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpers, Traitors, and Rebels? They were
(<hi>if I am not deceived</hi>) all Romans, that is, no Chriſtians. <hi>Thoſe
very Loyal Pagans, that Perſecuted the poor Chriſtians, becauſe they
would not ſacrifice for the ſafety of the Empire and Emperor,
Thoſe Loyal Pagans, who would ſwear falſely by all their Gods,
rather than by the ſingle</hi> Genius <hi>of the Emperor, they were the
Men that ſo frequently depoſed, murthered, and deſtroyed their
Princes; that in one hundred and ten years there was about thirty
of them, and ſcarce three in all that time that died a natural
Death.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But where the Numerous body of Loyal Chriſtians in the
mean time,<note place="margin">Cap. 2.</note> who, as he tells <hi>Scapula, were ſo great a Multitude that
they were almoſt the greateſt part of every City;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Tanta ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minum mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudo, pars pene major Civitatis cujuſque.</note> and as he tells us
in the other Apology, they were fit to have undertaken any the
moſt dangerous War, though they had been inferiour in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
who ſo ſtoutly and fearleſsly ſuffered deaths, that were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarily
dreadful for their Religion? Why did they not
appear in the defence of ſome of theſe poor miſerable Emperors,
who were thus ſlaughtered one upon the neck of another? How
could they ſatisfie their conſciences to pay their Allegiance to
thirty Emperors in one hundred and ten years, and ſuffer above
twenty of theſe to be depoſed and murthered without ever in the
leaſt concerning themſelves what became of them, or who was in
the Imperial Throne. Certainly here was ſome reaſon for this,
it was not Cowardice; never in any Age were there greater
numbers of Heroical Martyrs than in this Century; four of the ten
Perſecutions fell in this ſhort period of time; and they bore them
with all the bravery that any of their Anceſtors had ſhewn. The
Depoſing Doctrine was not then dreamt of; At the end of this
dreadful Century they were as Innocent as at the beginning of it,
there was never a Traytor or Uſurper to be yet charged upon
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:61155:8"/>
the Chriſtian Church. Well, but what then, why did they ſuffer
the Pagans to murther their Princes at this rate? How could
they in conſcience pray for thirty Emperors in one hundred and ten
years, moſt of which were ſtained with the Royal Bloods of their
Predeceſſors; and who had no other. Title than that of a Proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perous
Uſurpation and a ſucceſsful Rebellion? Let the <hi>Iacobites</hi>
of our Age come forth now, and try if they can juſtifie theſe
Primitive Chriſtians in all this; let them produce their Arguments
and form Apologies for them, which ſhall not at the ſame time
be unanſwerable Objections againſt their own Practice.</p>
            <p>All that I can ſay for theſe Holy Menl, is this, They followed the
Example of our Saviour; and, as he ſaid in another caſe, who
made me a Judge and a divider of Civil Inheritances, or of the
Titles and Claims of Princes? So they ſaid here, who has given
us Power or Command to intereſt our ſelves in theſe things?
If we do our Duty and ſubmit to and pray for thoſe Powers that
we find ſet over us, by Men as the Inſtruments, by God as
the great diſpoſer of Crowns and Scepters, we are ſafe; for it is
he that Ruleth in the Kingdoms of Men, and ſets over them
<hi>The baſeſt of Men,</hi>

needs neither the Approbation</hi> (Judgment) <hi>nor aſſiſtance of Men,
when he pleaſed, and as far as he pleaſed, gave the Empire of the

<pb n="13" facs="tcp:61155:8"/>
and Sacrilegious and deteſtable curioſity was deceived by the
love of Empire; who truſting afterwards in thoſe vain Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles

<hi>Nero</hi> was ſet up by the Intriegues of <hi>Agrippina</hi> his Mother;
Yet St. <hi>Paul</hi> owned his <hi>power to be God,</hi> Rom. 13. For in that
Princes Reign, this Epiſtle was written, as Biſhop <hi>Pearſon</hi> proves
in his Annals of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> pag. 15. But the Chriſtians were few
in number then. Well, but they were numerous enough in the
ſecond and third Century, but they were all of St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi>'s
mind then too, and left God to diſpoſe of the Kingdoms of
the World as he thought fit. Now how did they know that
he had given the Empire in their times to this of that Man,
but by the event? and was that ſufficient to juſtifie them in
their acquieſcing in, and ſubmitting to, the Will of God thus diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
and will not the ſame be ſufficient to us too? Is not the ſame
Providence as powerful and as vigilant in our times as in theirs?</p>
            <p>For my part I was none of them that did, or durſt have reſiſted
or Rebelled againſt King <hi>James:</hi> but when he choſe rather to leave
his Kingdom, than to do his Subjects Right; it was juſt with
God and Men to confirm the Election he had made; and ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
he would not continue in the Station, God had placed him
in (that of a Regular and Limited Monarchy) but aſpired to
an Abſolute and unlimited Arbitrary Empire, and perſecuted
thoſe who had ſet him up and preſerved him in his Throne;
It was juſt, I ſay, that God ſhould ſay unto him as he did to
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:61155:9"/>
               <hi>Saul, Becauſe thou haſt rejected the word of the Lord; he hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
thee from being King.</hi> Seeing you have provoked and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted
your People, and have fled into a ſtrange Country, when
you might by obſerving your Oath and your Laws, have lived
happily in your own; you ſhall the fruit of your own
folly, <hi>and I will give it to a neighbour of thine that is better than
you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now I would fain know of my Country men, who are ſtill
diſſatisfied, what I or any of the other Members of the Church
of <hi>England,</hi> who never reſiſted King <hi>James</hi> till he left us, have
done more than the Primitive Chriſtians did in the like Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances;
and I would have them produce but one Example in
all thoſe times of a Chriſtian that did ſcruple to ſubmit to, or
pray for, the Prince that was ſet over him, be his Title what
it would.<note place="margin">Lactantius de mortibus perſecuto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum.</note> And when his hand is in, let him ſhew me the
Chriſtian that deſired the Reſtitution of <hi>Diocleſian</hi> or <hi>Liciniu;</hi>
two perſecuting Princes,<note place="margin">Euſeb. H. E. lib. <hi>VIII. c.</hi> 13.</note> who were as manifeſtly laid aſide as
King <hi>James</hi> was or could be; ſuppoſing he was purely forced,
and that there was nothing of his will in it, which yet were a very
extravagant Suppoſition.</p>
            <p>2. I come now to the Second thing, I propoſed to examine,
whether thoſe who ſtand for the Non-reſiſting Doctrine are by
it bound to endeavour the Reſtitution of <hi>James</hi> the Second,
now he had deſerted the Throne, and withdrawn his Perſon
and Seals?</p>
            <p>I have in part anticipated this Enquiry in the former part,
as it was impoſſible to do otherwiſe, by ſhewing the Primitive
Chriſtians who owned and practiſed this Doctrine to the higheſt,
did yet never concern themſelves for the Titles or Succeſſions
of their Princes, but ſubmitted to thoſe they found in the
Throne, good, or bad, by what Right, Title or Pretence ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
they came in.</p>
            <p>The only reaſon that be given for this, is what I have
aſſigned out of St. <hi>Auguſtin, viz.</hi> That the Kingdoms of the
World were ſo particularly under the Government of God,
that no perſon could uſurp them without his particular Gift
and Providence. They did not in this caſe make any difference
between his <hi>Approbation</hi> and <hi>Permiſſion:</hi> They knew and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
this thing was managed in ſuch manner, that it was
impoſſible for Man ſometimes after the utmoſt ſearch to find
out the reaſon of it; but yet they ſaid alſo with St. <hi>Auguſtin,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:61155:9"/>
God could approve nothing but what was juſt,</hi> and in this be ſure nothing
could happen but what he approved: no force, no fraud ever
prevailed againſt any Prince that was in Poſſeſſion, but by the
Will, and Approbation of God Almighty.</p>
            <p>The only Objection that can be made againſt this, is, That
this will ſeem to make God the Author or Approver of the
ill things that have been done to good Princes in the ſeveral
Ages of the World. To which I reply, That God has very
great Reaſon and Juſtice in all his Actions, though it is not
always known to Men. The beſt of Men have been guilty of great
offences, ſome of which have not been known to Men in general, and
others that were known have not been committed to writing, and
are loſt; but when all things ſhall in the laſt Day be diſcovered,
then it will appear, That God was juſt in all his ways, and righteous
in all his works.</p>
            <p>And though God has pleaſed to ſettle the Kingdom of the
World in certain Families and Perſons as he thought fit, yet he
has not thereby bound up his own hands ſo, that let them do
what they pleaſe, every perſon that is by his Providence ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted
to a Throne muſt neceſſarily Reign till his Death, and ſhall
then be ſucceeded by none but his next right Heir. God never
made a perſonal promiſe to any Family, but that of <hi>David;</hi>
and after that to <hi>Jehu:</hi> but in the Family of <hi>David</hi> (as the
Promiſe was in part conditional) there were many falſe ſteps, and
aberrations from the true Rules of an Hereditary Succeſſion;
and for the ſins of <hi>Solomen,</hi> God rent ten of the Tribes out of
the hand of <hi>Rehoboam</hi> his Son, which never after returned under
the Houſe of <hi>David;</hi> and though this is ſtiled a Rebellion, yet
God owns <hi>that this thing was from him,</hi> 1 King. 12. 24. And
the Family of <hi>Jehu</hi> ended in the fourth deſent, as it was fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told.</p>
            <p>Now put theſe two together, That there is a particular Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
that particularly concerns it ſelf in the diſpoſing of Crowns,
againſt which neither Fraud nor Force can prevail: And, That
God has an abſolute Right, as well as full Power to diſpoſe of the
Kingdoms of the World as he pleaſe; and accordingly has in every
Age of the World, <hi>de facto,</hi> diſpoſed of them; and the Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
will be, That whoſoever aſcends a Throne, and reigns in any
Kingdom, doth it by the Will and Appointment of God: And in
this no Wrong is done by God, for he may diſpoſe of what is his
own, when and how he pleaſe: All Princes are Gods <hi>Miniſters</hi> and
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:61155:10"/>
               <hi>Deputies,</hi> and, when he pleaſe, he may lay them aſide, and ſet up
others in their ſtead.</p>
            <p>And this in general is true of all Princes, Good and Bad; but
as to the latter, to what purpoſe are Prayers and Tears ſtiled,
The Arms of the Church againſt perſecuting Princes, if they were
of no Force? to what purpoſe ſhould Men cry unto the Lord, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
of the King, if he were reſolved never to hear them; or
which is all one, never to help them? And the Difficulty is the
ſame yet; if I may not accept of a Deliverance, when it comes.
Why, if God is pleaſed to put an end to the Life of an ill Prince,
and to ſet up the next immediate Succeſſor, then I may ſay I am de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered?
But when did God oblige himſelf to this? That he would
exerciſe this moſt Sovereign Juriſdiction, over Princes, only
one way; and that every Prince ſhould be ſucceeded by none but
his next immediate Heir: Where has he obliged us to accept of no
other Deliverance, and to reject all other Succeſſors but thoſe that
we took to be right, with the loſs of our Lives and Fortunes?
Did the Primitive Fathers of the Church act or write thus, or how
come we to be under other Laws than they were?</p>
            <p>If <hi>James</hi> II. governed us as he ought, according to his Laws and
his Oath, we are bound, in Gratitude, to deſire the continuance
of his Government, and to be much concerned that we are not
ſtill under his Scepter; for he was once the undoubted rightful King
of <hi>England:</hi> But if it was otherwiſe, if he perſecuted that Church,
he promiſed and was bound to protect, and did not treat us like
<hi>Engliſhmen,</hi> but like Slaves, what reaſon have we to deſire, now we
are delivered, to be again brought into the ſame Circumſtances
we ſo lately groaned under? <hi>Nero, Domitian</hi> and <hi>Decius,</hi> the three
firſt Perſecutors of the Chriſtian Church, all of them periſhed by the
Sword; but <hi>Valerian,</hi> the fourth, as he is reckoned by <hi>Lactantius,</hi>
did not eſcape neither; <hi>At illum Deus novo ac ſingulari poenae genere

This</hi> Apoſtate had many Chriſtian Soldiers under him, who when he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
them, To ſtand to their Arms, againſt the common Enemy of

That we took up Arms for, and not againſt our Countrymen; and we

               <hi>if we now fail of performing our Promiſe to our God?</hi> They were then
ſaid to be led into <hi>France,</hi> to fight againſt the <hi>Bagaudae,</hi> a ſort of
<hi>outlawed Chriſtians,</hi> who were forced, by the Iniquity of the Times,
to take up Arms under <hi>Diocleſian;</hi> and were all of them deſtroyed
by <hi>Maximianus;</hi> ſo that if that Story be true, it is a pregnant
Teſtimony, That he Doctrine of <hi>Paſſive Obedience</hi> doth not oblige
any Man to lend his Aſſiſtance to the Ruine of the true Religion.</p>
            <p>Beſide theſe Pagan Princes,<note place="margin">Socratis H. Eccl. lib. 2. cap. 12, 13, 27.</note> there were ſome <hi>Arian</hi> Princes, who
treated the Catholicks of their Times very hardly; and though
none of the Chriſtians of thoſe Times rebelled againſt them, yet
neither would the Catholicks aſſiſt the Arian Princes againſt the
Catholick Biſhops, as is plain in the Story of S. <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> and the
many Tumults at <hi>Conſtantinople, Antioch</hi> and <hi>Alexandria,</hi> in thoſe
Times; and when theſe Princes ſell by the Juſtice of God, in Civil
or Foreign Wars, their Ends were looked upon as deſerved: Thus
<hi>Valens</hi> periſhed in <hi>Thrace,</hi> and <hi>Valentinian,</hi> the younger, at <hi>Vienne,</hi>
the one by the Hands of the Goths, and the other by the Procure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of <hi>Arbogaſtes,</hi> an Uſurper; and the untimely Deaths of theſe
two Princes, proved the Exaltation of <hi>Theodoſius,</hi> the Reſettler of
the Catholick Religion, and the extirper of <hi>Arianiſm,</hi> in the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Empire.</p>
            <p>In all the various Events of theſe Times, the Providence of God
ordered things for the good of his Church, and the Chriſtians of
thoſe Times, left them to his Diſpoſal, and ſubmitted to thoſe he
ſet over them, quietly, and without diſputing their Rights or
Titles; whereas <hi>Procopius,</hi> who claimed the Empire, as couſin to
<hi>Julian</hi> the Emperor, periſhed in the Attempt, without pity, or the
Regard of the Church.</p>
            <p>There is no part of the Reign of <hi>James</hi> II. that has not been
examined and repreſented by many pens; ſo that it were a needleſs,
but an ungrateful Task for me, to rip it up again; it may ſuffice
to ſay, in general, Never any of our Princes ſo openly attempted
the Ruine of the Engliſh Liberties, or went ſo far in it; never
did any Man more openly endeavour the Ruine of an eſtabliſhed
Religion, or by more illegal Courſes than he: nor Laws, nor Oaths,
nor Promiſes, nor Gratitude could reſtrain him; he broke through
all the Barriers God and Man had put in his Way, and ſeemed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
to ruine us or Himſelf; no Remonſtrances from abroad,
no Petitions at home, could work upon him, till he ſaw the Sword
coming to cut up the <hi>Gourd</hi> he had planted, and was ſo fond of;
then indeed, he ſeemed to relent and to give back; but ſtill he
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:61155:11"/>
would be truſted; he would yield up nothing, but ſo as that he
might, when the Danger was over, re-aſſume the ſame again. An
<hi>Engliſh Parliament</hi> was the thing, in the World, he moſt hated,
becauſe he foreſaw, if it was Free, there was an end, for ever, of
the Hopes of ſetting up Popery in this Kingdom; and that was his
main and almoſt only Deſign; and yet, as fond as he ever ſeemed
to be of an Abſolute and Uncontroulable Power, if he had been of
our Church, he would not have hazarded all for it, but he would
have managed Things with ſome Reſerve; but the Jeſuites he took
into his Boſom, and his Queen, eſpecially, ſpurred him on; and
put him upon theſe Courſes, only by repreſenting to him the Glory
and Merit of extirpating the Northern Hereſies, and ſettling the
Catholick Religion in <hi>England.</hi>

               <hi>Well, but what has he done ſince he left us, that may give us any
Aſſurance, we were miſtaken, as to what was paſt, or may hope
for better Uſage for time to come? Why, there have been ſome
General Promiſes made: In the Letter, pretended to be ſent to the

Several Petitions were alſo preferred for the Pardons of Sir <hi>Thomas

            <list>
               <item>1. After this they paſſed an Act for repealing <hi>Poyning's</hi> Law.</item>
               <item>2. Againſt counterfeiting Foreign Coins.</item>
               <item>3. And an Act for the attainting of many hundreds of the Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity

            <p>But the Town of <hi>London-Derry</hi> holding out, and an Army being
every Day expected from <hi>England,</hi> the 18th of <hi>July</hi> this Parliament
was prorogued till <hi>October:</hi> And notwithſtanding their Act for
Liberty of Conſcience, and the dreadful Expectation of a ſudden
Revenge from <hi>England,</hi> the Popiſh Clergy took poſſeſſion of the
Tithes and Church Revenues; and many of the Proteſtant Clergy,
were clapt up in Priſon, in order to be ſent into <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All that our diſcontented Party, here in <hi>England,</hi> have to ſay to all
this is, That we muſt not believe <hi>all</hi> is told, as out of <hi>Ireland;</hi>
but they mean, That we muſt believe <hi>nothing of it,</hi> but call in
King <hi>James,</hi> and try if he will uſe us at the ſame rate.</p>
            <p>We have a Proverb, That <hi>Experience is the Miſtreſs of Fools;</hi> and
certainly none but ſuch will come a ſecond time under her Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline,
when they have ſo lately tried it; and ſee every Day hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds
of the Nobility, Gentry and Clergy of <hi>Ireland</hi> flee hither to
ſave their Lives, with the loſs of all beſides, who agree very
exactly one with another in theſe dreadful Stories.</p>
            <p>Now let it be conſidered, That nothing was asked by the Biſhops,
in their Propoſals, and by the Lords Spiritual and Temporal in
their Petition of the 17th of <hi>November,</hi> but a free and legal Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
and the redreſs of our Grievances; and that this was the
principal thing inſiſted on by the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> in his Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
<hi>viz.</hi> That a free and legal Parliament might ſettle and adjuſt
all things in Difference or Diſpute; and that it was obſtinately
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:61155:13"/>
refuſed till the 28<hi>th</hi> of that Month, and then granted when it could
be no longer denyed, the greateſt part of the Nobility and Army
being then gone over to the Prince.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Let alſo that Paſſage in the Proclamation of the</hi> 30th of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember
<hi>be conſidered.</hi> For the reconciling all Publick breaches and
obliterating the very Memory of all paſt Miſcarriages, We do here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
Exhort and kindly Admoniſh all our Subjects to diſpoſe themſelves
to Elect ſuch Perſons, for their Repreſentatives in Parliament, as
may not be byaſſed by Prejudice, or Paſſion, but qualified with Parts,
Experience and Prudence proper for this Conjuncture, and agreeable
to the Ends and Purpoſes of this Our Gracious Proclamation. <hi>And
after this, that by his Meſſage of the</hi> 8th <hi>of</hi> December, <hi>ſent by the
three Lords to the Prince of</hi> Orange, <hi>He promiſed,</hi> That he would
conſent to every thing that could be reaſonably required for the ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of thoſe that came to it; <hi>that is, to the Parliament. And
that the</hi> 10th <hi>of</hi> December <hi>he ſent for the Lord Mayor and Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermen
and Sheriffs of</hi> London <hi>to</hi> Whitehall, <hi>and again paſſed his
Word to them, That though the Queen and Child were gone
for</hi> France, He would ſtay with them; <hi>And though this Evening he
received ſuch an Anſwer from the Prince to his Propoſals, that
he could not but acknowledge,</hi> It was fairer than he could or
did expect; <hi>Yet after all theſe ſolemn ingagements he burnt the
Writs for the Summoning a Parliament, and went the very next
Morning away for</hi> France, <hi>as his Roman Catholick Friends had
foretold he would above a fortnight before. And who accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly
ſent a Letter to him whilſt he was at</hi> Salisbury, <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwading
him to come back from thence, and withdraw himſelf
out of the Kingdom,</hi> and leave it in confuſion; Aſſuring him, That
within two years or leſs the Nation would be in ſuch Diſorder, that
he might come back and have his Ends of it: <hi>That is, Ruine both
our Civil Rights and our Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When all theſe ſolemn promiſes were thus eaſily broken, or rather
never intended to be kept at the very time they were made, and
all thoſe he has ſince made have been violated in <hi>Ireland,</hi> where
only he had power to keep or break his word, what can we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
but that, as a Miniſter of State told our Planters, <hi>It is very
undecent, not to ſay undutiful, to tax</hi> (this) <hi>King with his Promiſes;</hi>
Who of all Mankind has ſhewn the leaſt regard in time paſt to
them, and for time to come can never be blamed for any breach?
the Parties that take his word being alone reſponſible for their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corrigible
folly.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:61155:14"/>
Some of theſe Men have confeſſed to me, That if ever he be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored
<hi>they expect to be treated as they were before</hi> (without Truth,
Juſtice or Mercy) but <hi>yet if it be his Right, he muſt have it.</hi> And
they cannot think his Right can be determined but by Death or
a voluntary ſurrender, or a Conqueſt made by meer Foreigners,
to the utter Ruine of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation. And they will admit
no Anſwer to theſe their Scruples, but what ſhall be palpable, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victive
to that degree that they can make no Objection againſt
it. Now if they admit all the dreadful conſequences that attend
this relapſe, and yield up both Church and Nation to certain and
inevitable ruine, only that they may not be damned for Perjury
and Diſobedience to a King that has left them when he might
have ſtaied; and now offereth to return and do what he then
refuſed; What ſhall we alſo conſent and ſacrifice our ſelves and
our Poſterity to the humour or ſcruples of theſe Men? Shall we
ſuffer the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Church, Liberties, and the very People of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
to be deſtroyed to gratifie two or three hundred perſons?
I have been told from good hands,<note place="margin">Biſhop Ken.</note> That one of our Biſhops
ſaid, <hi>Though he could not ſatisfie his own Scruples, yet he thought
the</hi> Engliſh <hi>Nation fools if ever they ſuffered King</hi> James <hi>to return;</hi>
and I may from hence reaſonably conclude the far greateſt part
of our Scruplers are ſatisfied in the main, and do heartily wiſh
they could alſo be of the ſame mind with the reſt of their Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
in the reſt; ſo that the cauſe is half obtained againſt them,
and thoſe that ſhall finally perſiſt will, I hope, not meet with much
Compaſſion, it being ſcarce poſſible there ſhould not be a very
great deal of Will in ſo much blindneſs.</p>

               <hi>That</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land
<hi>was delivered from an Arbitrary Government, which threatned
the Ruine and Deſolation of the whole Nation, and the Deſtruction
of our Religion, without the ſhedding any of our Blood, and that the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my

No, they cry, if King <hi>William</hi> the Third had entered
<hi>England</hi> as <hi>William</hi> the Firſt did, and had ſlain fifty or ſixty
thouſand <hi>Engliſh</hi> Men in a Battle, then it had been a true Conqueſt,
and would have juſtified our ſubmiſſion, and God would not have
been offended with us if we had transferred our Allegiance from
the beaten <hi>James</hi> to the Victorious King <hi>William.</hi> Now if Men
were like Beaſts, altogether diſtitute of the uſe of Reaſon, and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:61155:14"/>
of no Reflection but the terrour of a brandiſhed and
irreſiſtable Sword, then there might perhaps be ſome force in this
reaſon: but if a Man is conquered whenever he is brought to
ſubmit to another; the Nobleſt as well as the moſt effectual Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt
is that of the Pen; Swords conquer Bodies only, Reaſon and
Intereſt, Juſtice and Mercy, ſubdue Souls too, and at once bring
the whole Man under; whereas Brutiſh force can triumph over
none but the brutiſh half of a Man. A Lyon or a Woolf may
maſter my Body and bring me under his power, ſo that I nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
can nor durſt reſiſt him; but none but an Hero can bring
me to a willing Submiſſion when I am free, none but an Hero
would with his own hazard deliver me from Slavery when I
were oppreſs'd. St. <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith, <gap reason="foreign">

<hi>By whom a Man is overcome, him he muſt ſerve; That is, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
reſiſt him;</hi> and it is as true, <hi>he whom I neither can nor durſt
reſiſt, has conquered me.</hi> When <hi>James</hi> the Second was deſired to
leave <hi>Whitehall</hi> and go to <hi>Ham;</hi> and ſent to his now Majeſty
<hi>for leave to go rather to</hi> Rocheſter, <hi>than to any other place;</hi> It was a
plain Confeſſion he was no longer Free, <hi>i. e.</hi> That <hi>he was brought
into bondage,</hi> and conſequently that he was <hi>conquered:</hi> if Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt
be nothing but the <hi>depriving a Man of the power of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting,</hi>
as I take it to be; and that <hi>Servitude</hi> or <hi>Bondage</hi> is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but the effect of that deprivation. And in his Letter
from <hi>Rocheſter</hi> he ſaith, <hi>He did not think it convenient to expoſe
himſelf to be ſecured ſo as not to be at liberty to effect it (to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem
the Nation from Slavery) and for that reaſon to withdraw,</hi>
&amp;c. That is, he left <hi>England,</hi> becauſe as long as he ſtaied in
it he was a Captive and liable to be <hi>ſecured.</hi> And by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
he was conquered. The Roman Catholicks too, and
thoſe few of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> who ſtill adhere to him,
were conquered by force of Arms; for they durſt not reſiſt, nay
they durſt not Print the Reaſons why they will not comply,
which is a plain Confeſſion they are ſubdued. The reſt of the
Nation too was conquered not by the Sword, but by the Juſtice
of his Arms; and his Kindneſs to a miſerable enſlaved People
deſigned for Ruine. And after all this, to query whether it is a
real Conqueſt, is very abſurd.</p>
            <p>But every Conqueſt will perhaps not create a juſt and good
Title, but here it is confeſſed the preſent King had the moſt
juſt cauſe to make a War upon <hi>James</hi> the Second, that ever Man
had, by them who ſcruple to ſubmit to him; He managed this
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:61155:15"/>
War alſo with the utmoſt juſtice, he did not enter into it
till he had tried all other ways to obtain Juſtice, and was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
it and perſecuted into boot, he offered to ſubmit all his
pretences to an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Parliament: and when that was rejected
he managed the War with ſo exact a diſciplie, with ſo little in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury
to the reſt of the Nation, that the want of the effects of War,
Blood and Rapine, is objected againſt his Victory.</p>
            <p>Every Man has not the Right of making a Conqueſt: <hi>a Subject</hi>
that rebels againſt his Prince is but a Victorious Traytor if he
prevail; but <hi>William</hi> the Third was a Sovereign Prince when he
entered <hi>England,</hi> and by the Law of Nations had a right to vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
his, and his Ladies Injuries, and obtain by the Sword, what he
could not get by a fair Treaty.</p>
            <p>But to what end is War allowed at all, if the Cauſe and the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
muſt be ſeparated, and the moſt juſt War in the end leave the
Conqueror in the ſame ſtate he was before? No, but all Subjects,
Right or Wrong, are bound to ſtand by their Lawful Princes in their
moſt unjuſt Quarrels: and if at laſt they are ſubdued, their Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
muſt be reſerved for the injurious beaten Prince till he die or
freely reſign; that is, Victorious Sovereign Prince and a Proſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Rebel, and a juſt and an unjuſt War, ſhall, according to theſe
Men's Notion, have the ſame effect.</p>

               <hi>Evagrius,</hi> in his Apology for the Chriſtian Religion againſt <hi>Zo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zimus</hi>
the Pagan Hiſtorian,<note place="margin">Hiſt. Eccl. lib. III. cap. 41.</note> thus beſpeaks him: <q>Let us, if you pleaſe
Sir, conſider the ends of thoſe Princes who imbraced the Pagan Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition,
and the Deaths of thoſe Princes that were Chriſtians.
Did not <hi>Caius Julius Caeſar</hi> the firſt of them that obtained the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire
of <hi>Rome,</hi> periſh by Treachery? And was not <hi>Caius Caligula</hi>
Murthered by his own Souldiers? Was not <hi>Nero</hi> ſlain by one of
his own Servants? Did not <hi>Galba, Otho</hi> and <hi>Vitellius</hi> all periſh by
the Sword in the ſpace of ſixteen Months? Did not <hi>Domitian</hi> poiſon
his Brother <hi>Titus,</hi> and then he himſelf fall by the Sword of one <hi>Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanus?</hi>
What will you ſay of <hi>Commodus?</hi> Did not <hi>Narciſſus</hi> lay vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent
hands upon him? And did not <hi>Pertinax</hi> and <hi>Julian</hi> fall by
the ſame means? <hi>Antoninus,</hi> the Son of <hi>Severus,</hi> ſlew <hi>Geta</hi> his Brother,
and ſoon after fell by the Sword of <hi>Martialis</hi> himſelf. Was not
<hi>Macrinus</hi> the Emperour taken Captive by his own Souldiers, and
being led about the Streets of <hi>Byzantium</hi> afterwards, was he not
moſt Traiterouſly ſlain by them? <hi>Aurelius Antoninus</hi> the Emperour
who was born at <hi>Emiſa,</hi> a City of <hi>Syria,</hi> was ſlain with his Mother.
To what end ſhould I ſpeak of <hi>Maximinus,</hi> who was ſlain by his
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:61155:15"/>
own Souldiers? Of <hi>Gordian,</hi> who fell by the Swords of his too
who were ſtirred up to it by <hi>Philip?</hi> And were not <hi>Philip</hi> and
<hi>Decius</hi> both ſlain by their Foreign Enemies? <hi>Gallus</hi> and <hi>Veluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anus</hi>
by their own Armies? And had not <hi>Aemilian</hi> the ſame
Fate? Was not <hi>Valerian</hi> taken priſoner, and carried about by the
<hi>Perſians</hi> till he died? Was not <hi>Galienus,</hi> the Son of <hi>Valerian,</hi> ſlain
by Treachery, and <hi>Carinus</hi> beheaded, and ſo the Empire fell into
the hands of <hi>Diocleſian</hi> and thoſe he aſſociated to him in the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire;
of which <hi>Maximianus Herculius,</hi> and his Son <hi>Maxentius</hi>
and <hi>Licinius</hi> all fell by the Sword? But from the time <hi>Conſtantine,</hi>
a Chriſtian Prince, became Emperour, to this, ſee if you can find
any one who has reigned in <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> except <hi>Julian</hi> the
Apoſtate and <hi>Valens</hi> the Emperour, who have fallen by the hands
of their own Subjects or of Foreigners, who both ſo grieviouſly
afflicted the Chriſtians; nor has any Tyrant uſurped againſt
any of our Princes except <hi>Baſiliſcus,</hi> who roſe up againſt <hi>Zeno</hi>
the Emperor, and drove him from his Palace; but was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
overcome by <hi>Zeno,</hi> and put to death. You cannot aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
any other Emperor, but theſe two, that was ſlain in all this
time. This happened in the Year of Chriſt 476. And <hi>Licini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi>
was put to death in the Year 325.</q> So that in the ſpace of
151. Years no Chriſtian Prince had been Depoſed or Murther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by Domeſtick or Foreign Enemies in the <hi>Eaſt:</hi> And whereas,
I obſerved before in the latter times of the Pagan Superſtition, in
the ſpace of 110. Years, there were twenty nine Emperors in this
period, which makes 151 Years, there was but twelve, of which
number <hi>Julian</hi> and <hi>Valens</hi> were cut off by the Juſtice of God for
Perſecuting his Church. Now the force of all this Argument lies
in this,<note place="margin">See the 1. Collect, for the 5<hi>th</hi> of <hi>Novemb.</hi>
               </note> That the Providence of God watcheth over Pious Princes
to preſerve them from Violence: and as he ſuffereth not perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
Princes to end their daies in Peace, he looks graciouſly upon
his Servants to preſerve their Souls from violence and wrong, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they are ſuch. But if it is ſaid he has ſuffered ſome good
Princes to be oppreſſed as he did <hi>Henry</hi> the Sixth and <hi>Charles</hi> the
Firſt; I ſay the Judgments of God are ſometimes unſcrutable,
and thoſe that have any hand in ſuch Actions, ſhall doubtleſsly be
reſponſible for it. But as for thoſe who are meerly paſſive, as
they could not hinder the ill things that happened in their times,
they may and ought to commit them to God; who in his due
time will puniſh all unjuſt Uſurpers, either in their Perſons or in
their Poſterity.</p>

But then this new Doctrine of ſtanding by wicked perſecuting
Princes, to the apparent and viſible Ruine of the Church, or at
leaſt of thoſe that imbrace it, was never heard of in the Church
before, was never taught or practiſed by the Primitive Chriſtians;
and is not any part of the Doctrine of Paſſive Obedience or Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſiſtance:
As they would not rebel againſt their Princes, how wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
or cruel ſoever they were; ſo neither would they againſt God,
whoſe only Right it is to diſpoſe of the Kingdoms of the World;
without whoſe Approbation as well as Permiſſion, no Force ever did,
or ever ſhall, prevail; who when he pleaſes puniſheth the Wicked,
and when he pleaſeth pulls down not only unjuſt Uſurpers, but
thoſe who have the juſteſt Title.<note place="margin">Thuanus, Ann. 1559.</note> The great <hi>Thuanus</hi> makes this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection

to the Conduct of their Paſſions, or otherwiſe they ought to aſſure

Princes, than of unlawful Uſurpers, no Title can exempt a Prince
from being reſponſible to the Juſtice of God, and he will uſe his
Power as he thinks fit, and puniſh one Man after one manner, and
another in another; ſome in this World, and others in the next;
and the Church in the beſt of times accordingly left it to him to
diſpoſe of the Government of the World: and as ſhe did not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipate
his Judgments by diſturbing the Peace of the World, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
ſhe ſuffered; ſo neither did ſhe think her ſelf more wiſe or
juſt than he, but ſubmitted to thoſe he was pleaſed in his Providence
to ſet over her; and would certainly have been very thankful for
ſuch a Deliverance as we of the Church of <hi>England</hi> have had, by
the Miniſtery of our King, who like another <hi>Conſtantine</hi> has de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered

Ancient Fathers and Primitive Chriſtians do every where aſcribe
the Setting up and Pulling down of Princes to God only, as
they do Raine and other ſuch things; and you ſhall never find
any Exception, of lawful, or unlawful Powers, that were ſupreme

            <p>Some have alledged in anſwer to this, That we in <hi>England</hi> are
under other Circumſtances than the Primitive Church were,
both in Relation to our Laws and our Oaths; for the Law,
Sir <hi>Edward Coke</hi> in his Pleas of the Crown, Chap. 1. p. 7. ſaith,
upon the 25 <hi>E. 3. c. 2. <hi>This Statute is to be underſtood</hi>
               </hi> of a
King in Poſſeſſion of the Crown and Kingdom; <hi>for if</hi> there be a
King Regnant in Poſſeſſion of the Crown, although he be <hi>Rex de
facto &amp; non de jure;</hi> yet he is <hi>Seignior le Roy within the Purvieu</hi>
of this Statute, and the other that <hi>hath Right</hi> and is out of
Poſſeſſion, is not within this Act. Nay, If Treaſon be commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
againſt a King <hi>de facto &amp; non de jure, and</hi> after the King
<hi>de jure</hi> cometh to the Crown, he ſhall <hi>Puniſh</hi> the Treaſon done
to the King, <hi>de facto. And a</hi> Pardon granted by a King <hi>de jure,</hi>
that is not alſo <hi>de facto,</hi> is void, for which he cites 11 <hi>H. 7.
c. 1. 4 E. 4. 1. 1 Ed.</hi> 4. 1, 2.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:61155:17"/>
The words of the Statute are as followeth.</p>
            <q>The King our Sovereign Lord calling to his remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
the Duty of Allegiance of his Subjects of this
Realm,<note place="margin">11 H. 7. c. 1</note> and that they by reaſon of the ſame are bound to
ſerve their Prince and Sovereign Lord for the time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in his Wars, for the Defence of him and the Land, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
every Rebellion, Power and Might reared againſt
him, and with him to enter and abide in ſervice in Battel,
if caſe ſo require; (2) and that for the ſame ſervice what
fortune ever fall by chance in the ſame Battle againſt
the Mind and Will of the Prince (as in this Land
ſome time paſſed hath been ſeen) that it is not reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
but againſt all Law, Reaſon, and good Conſcience,
that the ſaid Subjects going with their Sovereign Lord
in Wars, attending upon him in his Perſon, or being
in other places by his commandment within this Land
or without, any thing ſhould loſe or forfeit for doing their
true Duty and Service of Allegiance, <hi>&amp;c—</hi> That for
the ſaid deed and true Duty of Allegiance he or they be in
no wiſe Convict or Attaint of high Treaſon, ne of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Offences for that cauſe by Act of Parliament or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe
by any Proceſs of Law whereby he or any of
them ſhall loſe or forfeit Life, Lands, Tenements, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
or any other things, but to be for that Deed and Service
utterly diſcharged of any vexation, trouble or loſs. And
if any Act or Acts or other Proceſs of the Law hereafter
thereupon for the ſame happen to be made contrary to
this Ordinance, that then that Act or Acts or other Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs
of the Law, whatſoever they ſhall be, ſtand and
be utterly void. (5) Provided always that no Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
or Perſons ſhall take any Benefit or Advantage
by this Act which ſhall hereafter decline from his or their

               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:61155:17"/>
Which is to be underſtood of the King in being, as the reſt is, and
againſt the ſame King. To this Statute it is alledged, That the
Title of the Crown was then ſo ambiguous and uncertain, that it was
hard to know where the Right lay; which is a meer Cavil. The
Title was as well known then as it is now, and is a thing of that
Nature, that it can never be univerſally known; but the greateſt
part of Mankind take thoſe that are ſet over them, without further
inquiry; nor is it reaſonable any Man ſhould ſuffer for obeying them
whom he cannot nor ought to reſiſt: So that what ſome have ſaid,
That every one is bound to take notice of the right Title at his Peril
is true, if the Perſon is in Poſſeſſion, but falſe if he is out of Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion.</p>
            <p>Conqueſt, a voluntary Surrender, and a wilful Deſertion of a
Crown, will put an End to the beſt founded Title in the World,
as I think is univerſally agreed; ſo that if the Party pretending,
has a Title, why is he not in Poſſeſſion too? if he is outed by his
own Act, I am abſolved; if by the Force and Power of another,
why then, he is conquered: and both waies (eſpecially if I had no
hand in it) I am, and ought to be abſolved before God and Man.</p>
            <p>But then not only the three Eſtates of <hi>England,</hi> but all the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
and Sovereign States in Chriſtendom (except the King of <hi>France</hi>)
have allowed King <hi>William</hi> and Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> as the rightful Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigns
of <hi>England;</hi> which is a kind of giving Judgment againſt the
late King, after hearing what has been alledged on both ſides. So
that this Caſe is determined by all the ways that are poſſible; and
muſt abſolve any Man that ſubmits now to that which is the only
Supreme Power in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As to the <hi>Oaths</hi> taken to the late King, they create no new Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
upon us as to the Extent or Duration of our Allegiance; I was
under the ſame Obligations of Allegiance, before I was ſworn, as I
was afterwards; and every Subject of <hi>England,</hi> oweth, by the Laws
of <hi>England,</hi> a natural Allegiance to his Prince before he is ſworn, as
every Man ows naturally Obedience to God, before he entreth into
the Baptiſmal Covenant: And ſo the Primitive Chriſtians were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the ſame Obligation to their Princes we are, tho' I do not find
they ever ſwore any Allegiance to them.</p>
            <p>2. This Allegiance is no everlaſting Obligation as to time; Death,
a voluntary Reſignation, a wilful Deſertion, or a lawful Conqueſt
will put an End to it.</p>
            <p>3.<note place="margin">Magna cha. c. 29. 2 E. 3. c. 8.</note> It is no wild, unlimited Obedience, whilſt it laſteth, but is
plainly limited by the Laws of God and the Laws of the Land, and
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:61155:18"/>
if I obey further actively, I am reſponſible to God and Man for it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I come now to the Words of the Oaths, which may ſeem to create
any Scruple; which in the Oath of Supremacy I ſuppoſe may be
theſe.</hi> I do promiſe that from henceforth I ſhall bear Faith and true Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance
to the King's Highneſs, his Heirs and Lawful Succeſſors
(<hi>and to my Power</hi>) ſhall aſſiſt and defend all Juriſdictions, Priviledges,
Preheminences and Authorities granted or belonging to the King's High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
his Heirs and Succeſſors, or united and annexed to the Imperial
Crown of this Realm.</p>
            <p>Where firſt I obſerve, No Man is bound beyond <hi>his Power,</hi> but
that all thoſe who ſtuck to the late King, till he left the Nation, and
another took Poſſeſſion of his Place, are thereby diſabled and freed
from attempting any further.</p>
            <p>2. That the Authorities I am to defend are ſuch only as belong
to the Crown of <hi>England</hi> by the Laws of <hi>England;</hi> which are to
limit my Allegiance; but by the Law of <hi>England,</hi> my Allegiance is
now transferred to another, and cannot be due to two in oppoſition
each to other; ſo that if I perſiſt in my Allegiance to <hi>James</hi> II. I am
puniſhable by theſe very Laws; therefore my Allegiance, which
was a legal Allegiance is determined.</p>
            <p>That in the Oath of Allegiance, which may be objected, is this,</p>
            <p>I will bear Faith and true Allegiance to his Majeſty, his Heirs and
Succeſſors, and him and them will defend, to the <hi>uttermoſt of my Power,</hi>
againſt all Conſpiracies and Attempts whatſoever, which ſhall be made
againſt his or their Perſons, their Crown and Dignity, by reaſon or colour
of any ſuch Sentence or otherwiſe, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Now this Oath, which binds us to the Perſon, as the other did to
the Power, is capable of the ſame Limitation, and is to be limited
both as to its Duration and extent, by the Laws of <hi>England,</hi> and the
Law of Nations; and therefore is determinable the ſame way the
other was.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Power,</hi> and <hi>uttermoſt Power,</hi> reſerved and expreſſed in theſe
<hi>Oaths,</hi> is a <hi>Legal Power,</hi> and therefore no Man is by theſe <hi>Oaths</hi>
bound to exert his Natural Power for any Prince, when he may by
the Laws of <hi>England</hi> be puniſhed as a <hi>Traytor</hi> for ſo doing; it being
a Legal and not an Illegal <hi>Allegiance</hi> we promiſe by them.</p>
            <p>If King <hi>James</hi> would have been contented with the <hi>Preheminences,
Priviledges, Authorities and Juriſdictions granted and annexed, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
to the Crown of</hi> England, I believe no Body queſtions but he
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:61155:18"/>
had been ſtill King of <hi>England;</hi> but by graſping at others, which
did not belong to him, he cut off his own Succours, and hindred
thoſe that otherwiſe would have defended him and them from doing
it: He would not be content with thoſe that belonged to him, and
they could not fight for, or defend any other; and between theſe two
his Power fell to the Ground, by his own Default; and his with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing
put an End to his Sovereignty; and put our preſent King
and Queen in the actual Poſſeſſion of all thoſe Legal Juriſdictions,
Priviledges, Preheminences and Authorities, which he was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
veſted with; and it is now the ſame Sin to reſiſt <hi>them,</hi> it was
formerly to reſiſt <hi>him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There may poſſibly be ſome, who will lightly regard what

What did he get by his War againſt our God? Why, that he
was ever after afraid of Thunder and Lightning. <hi>Nicomedia</hi> ſaith
this, and they who ſaw it will not be ſilent; among whom <hi>I my ſelf
was one.</hi> The <hi>Palace</hi> was conſumed, and his very Chamber burnt
with Fire from Heaven; and thereupon wiſe Men foretold what
would follow, for they could not conceal their Thoughts, nor
ſuppreſs their Reſentments at the ill things were done, but openly
and publickly, with aſſurance, ſaid one to another, <hi>What madneſs
is this? what boaſting in human Power for a Mortal to begin a War
againſt God, and injuriouſly to affront the moſt chaſt and holy Religion?
and without any Cauſe or Provocation to contrive the Deſtruction of ſo
many juſt Men, and of ſo numerous a People? What a famous Maſter
and teacher of Modeſty to his Subjects will he appear? How rarely he
teacheth his Soldiers to take Care of their Countrymen?</hi> Why, <hi>they
ſtab their fellow Subjects bravely, who in Fight never ſaw the back
of a beaten Enemy.</hi> At laſt the Providence of God undertook the
avenging this Impiety, tho' not without the publick Hurt; for ſo
much Blood had been ſhed by him, that if he had ſlain as many of
the <hi>Barbarians</hi> as he did of his own Subjects, we might have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured

in the Hand of a mean-ſpirited Prince, who had acquired it by

fit to reſtore the <hi>Romans</hi> to their ancient Liberty. <hi>The Voices of
oppreſſed Men, who cryed to God for Help under their Burthens, and
begged the Return of their natural Liberty (are not forgotten;) nor the
Praiſes they returned when they had regained it, and ſaw an end of
their Calamities: Did they not declare to all the World, How much

when their Liberty, and the Equity of their Contracts was reſtored?</hi>

They may be pleaſed to conſider, How much of this was our
Caſe; and ask their Conſciences, If the ſelf-ſame Divine Juſtice
and Providence has not appeared in our Times alſo, and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
we have not as much Reaſon as they to be pleaſed and thankful.</p>
            <p>Having thus diſpatched what I think fit for the preſent to be
offered to the Friends of the late King; I come now to that part of
the Nation, who being ſatisfied and highly pleaſed with the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
State of Affairs; may therefore be called, in contradiſtinction,
the <hi>Williamiſts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Many of theſe of late have appeared very pertly againſt the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of <hi>Non reſiſtance</hi> and Paſſive Obedience; and diſcourſed of it
with a Contempt and Scorn, as if it were one of the worſt and moſt
exploded Doctrines in the whole World; and full as Antichriſtian
as that of <hi>depoſing Kings, and diſpoſing of their Kingdoms.</hi> Now,
theſe two being directly contrary each to other, in all probability
one of them is true. If we of the Church of <hi>England</hi> are not in the
right with the Scriptures, and all Primitive Antiquity on our ſide;
it is fairly probable, They of the Depoſing Church are; for their
Claim is older than the Peoples: But the Miſchief is, the Devils is
older than either; for he pretended to our Saviour, when he had
ſhewed him all the Kingdoms of the World, and made a conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal
Tender of them, <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>.
<hi>All this Power and Glory is delivered into my Hands, and I give it to
whomſoever I will:</hi> Now this was long before People or Pope put in
any Claim, and before the latter of theſe had any Being. The
Pope, it is true, claims under the People, but the Devil in his own
Right: But I believe neither of them can ſhew their Charter,
though the Devil claimed by a Grant; and ſo I ſhall leave him
and them, Pope and all, in the intire poſſeſſion of their ſeveral
Rights, if any they have.</p>
            <p>The Doctrine of Non-reſiſtance has been often proved the genu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine
Doctrine of the beſt Ages of the Church; and that ſo fully and
clearly, that thoſe who would not yield to the Force of the Proof,
have not been able to deny the Truth of it, but have been forced
to pretend it was only Temporary, and doth not oblige all Ages;
which is hardly Senſe; or that the Church is now in other Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances
than ſhe was then; which is not true neither; for in
ſome Places ſhe is now under the ſame or worſe Circumſtances; than
ſhe was in the three firſt Centuries, and conſequently, they at leaſt,
are under the ſame Obligations the Primitive Chriſtians were; and
therefore this very Doctrine is of eternal Verity, and will have
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:61155:20"/>
its Uſe till the End of the World. The command is general, the
Examples of it are general, and it is now confeſſedly neceſſary in
<hi>Turky,</hi> and all Countries where Chriſtianity is oppreſſed; and by
conſequence every where, except ſome Body can ſhew, We have
one Goſpel for the Afflicted, and another for the proſperous Daies
of the Church; or one Remedy, <hi>viz.</hi> that of Patience was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed
to our Anceſtors, and another directly contrary to us;
which if any Man can ſhew, when and where it was done, I ſhall be
very thankful.</p>
            <p>But it may be pretended it has been ſtretched too far; and that
ſome of the Church of <hi>England</hi> have written too much in Favour of
Wicked and Tyrannical Princes, even to the encouraging them to
do worſe than otherwiſe they would: To this I ſay, The Heat of
Controverſie has in other Inſtances miſ-led Men as well as in this;
and the Doctrine of Non-reſiſtante is nevertheleſs true, tho' their
Notions of it ſhould happen to prove too looſe or too large. Let it
then be fairly and truly ſtated once for all, and then let it be as it
ever has been, The Glory of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and the Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wark
of all Religious Kings and States, againſt the Rage of Muti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous
and Rebellious Spirits, who pretend to ſight for God's
Truth, againſt the Laws and Governments of their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries.</p>
            <p>If any Man thinks ſome of the things that were done in the heat
of the late Revolution cannot be juſtified, without exploding this
Doctrine: I ſay thoſe are the Faults of a few Men, and better it is
to leave them to their own Maſter, than to ſet up our ſelves againſt
the Doctrines of Chriſtianity to excuſe them. The Men of our Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration
have all the Infirmities that have gone along with the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer;
and being ſo highly provoked by a handful of perfidious un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful
Miſcreants, what Wonder is it if the Temptation, which
was ſo ſtrong, prevailed over the Reſtraint, and made them guilty
of ſome Irregularities, which according to the ſtrict Rules of the
<hi>Goſpel,</hi> cannot be juſtified; ſuch things have happened in the beſt
of the former Ages, and will happen again in thoſe that ſhall follow
us. But the Rule of Chriſtianity ought to be preſerved, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,
and delivered down to our Poſterity juſt as we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
it.</p>
            <p>Thoſe that have appeared againſt this Doctrine have done their
Majeſties Two great Injuries. Firſt, They have exaſperated the
Diſſatisfied Party in the Nation, and made them harder to be won
over; they concluding, that this <hi>Revolution</hi> was not the Work of
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:61155:20"/>
God, becauſe ſo many of thoſe who have defended it, have made it
their buſineſs to ridicule or confute the Doctrine of <hi>Paſſive Obedience,</hi>
as if there were no other way than that to juſtifie it. But then
they are well aſſured this is as certain a Principle of the Chriſtian
Religion, and was ever practiſed by the Primitive Church in the five
firſt Centuries; and from thence they conculde, the Men that do
this and all other that joyn with them, have made a Defection from
this Doctrine, and from the Church of <hi>England;</hi> and they think
themſelves bound in Conſcience to oppoſe all thoſe that are thus uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
leſt they ſhould ſeem betrayers of this Loyal, Holy, Excellent
Doctrine, and of the Honour of that Church that hath ever taught it.</p>
            <p>Secondly, They have deprived them, as much as in them lies, of
that religious awe and reverence, which is due to all Crowned
Heads and Sovereign States. If they are the <hi>Miniſters of God,</hi> if
they are the <hi>Powers ordained by God,</hi> then is all reſiſtance of them
a ſin againſt God. But theſe Men write as if it were lawful to <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt</hi>
when they pleaſed, and whom they pleaſed; which, if it is true,
I am very confident it will not be long before they will pretend they
have cauſe, or ſome other for them; and ſo all Princes ſhall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived
of their beſt Safegard, the fear of God over-awing their
Subjects, as the juſt avenger of ſuch as rebel againſt their rightful,
lawful Princes, and the Laws of their Country.</p>
            <p>As there muſt be in every Country a Supreme Power lodged ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where,
againſt which there is no Appeal but to God; ſo that
Power muſt be acknowledged to be Sacred and Irreſiſtable, by the
Laws of Chriſtianity: and this is as true of Commonwealths as
Monarchies, for whereſoever the Supreme Power is lodged, it is
the Ordinance of God, approved by his Word, and ſettled by his
Providence, <hi>whoſoever then reſiſteth that Power, reſiſteth the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
of God, and ſhall receive to themſelves Damnation.</hi> He, then,
that ſhall endeavour to deſtroy this Obligation, and to perſuade
Men they are not bound in Conſcience to ſubmit to the Laws and
lawful Governors of their Country, contradicts this plain Doctrine
of the Apoſtle, and expoſeth the Supreme Powers in all Countries
to the Rage and Fury of the Multitude, or any Faction that is
potent, and thinks it ſelf injured; and conſequently he is an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
to all Government.</p>
            <p>But then though I am bound not to reſiſt, I am not equally
bound to aſſiſt, my hands may be tied both ways; If I live in a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
Country, where Chriſtianity is Perſecuted by the Supreme Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
I muſt ſuffer and ought not to reſiſt; but then I am not to lend
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:61155:21"/>
my aſſiſtance to that State to encourage or enable it to deſtroy this
Religion, but I muſt be meerly paſſive in that caſe. And this was
the caſe of <hi>England,</hi> we were perſecuted againſt Law, by a hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
of Men, who expected to ruine us by our own hands; and we
were bound not to aſſiſt them in this wicked and fooliſh Project;
and for want of our aſſiſtance they could not juſtifie or carry on the
Enterprize: and when they came to be called to an Account by a
Prince who was no Subject, and conſequently was not under the
Obligation of not reſiſting their Injuſtice and Oppreſſion; ſo they
fell an eaſie Victim to his Arms, and we were delivered out of
their hand, not by any reſiſtance we made, but by refuſing to aſſiſt
them; and they that went no farther than this (which it is certain
the greateſt part of the Nation did not) are juſtifiable by the
ſtricteſt Rules of Chriſtianity, and the Practice of the beſt Ages.</p>
            <p>To conclude, I would adviſe even thoſe who have no kindneſs
for the Doctrine of <hi>Non-reſiſtance,</hi> to ſpeak modeſtly of it; it
has ſuch Characters of Divinity to ſhew, that it will deſerve this
reſpect at their hands, if they are Chriſtians: And as to thoſe
that are not, thoſe that deſpiſe all revealed Religion (for they
of late have been very witty againſt it) they ought to ſhew ſome
reverence to it, for the ſake of Government, and to preſerve the
Peace of the World in which that ſort of Men have a greater in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
than others; for their <hi>All</hi> lies in this World, and they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to nothing in the next; and if the World be imbroyled, let
the pretence be what it will, their happineſs muſt neceſſarily be
very much abated, and perhaps their <hi>Machines</hi> deſtroyed, and then
there is an end of them.</p>
