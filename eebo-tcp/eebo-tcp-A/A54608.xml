            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </item>
               <item>5. <hi>That he and his fellow Commissioners, had placed some Debenters in better places than they could claime, denying Right to others.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>6. <hi>That he and his fellow Commissioners had totally disposed of the Armies Security; the Debt still remaining chargable on the State.</hi>

               <item>
                  <p>That for the generallity of the Actions he had done, as Commissioner and Surveyour, he hoped he might without much vanity, glory in them; Instancing his Measuring twenty two Counties in thirteen Moneths, Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiying twenty thousand Debenters, without alteration, using strictnesse to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the greatest Persons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

Doctor asked, what he would give him to set it out to him.</hi> Flower <hi>answers,</hi>
100. l. <hi>The Doctor replied, 'twas an inconsiderable Reward, demanding
half the Rents, at length they conclude for</hi> 100. l. per annum, <hi>as a Rent
Charge, The said Sir</hi> Hierom <hi>calling the same, an Horrible bribe.</hi>

               <item>
                  <p>That he doth not remember any such expression as <hi>Land beyond the Moon,</hi> but that if it were used, 'twas in kindness towards the said Liuetenant Colonel <hi>Brayfield</hi>; That if he had not his Order served so soon as he desired, 'twas be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the said Doctor could find nothing good enough for him. For the said Doctor ever affected the person of the said <hi>Brayfield,</hi> was commanded by the Lord Lieutenant to assist him, and was desired the same by his then Partner and Friend, Sir <hi>Thomas Herbert.</hi>

               <item>
                  <p>That <hi>Winkworth</hi> is a very weak mistaking Person, who had no more wit then to think by this device to withhold the Doctor from Questioning him for the razure of an Order made in his own case.</p>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p>The others he needed onely to have denyed with some explication, Sir <hi>Hierom</hi> having upon more mature thoughts declined them himself.</p>
            <p>Sir <hi>Hierom</hi> after many threatnings of the said Doctor to question him again, sometimes in one place, and sometimes in another, did at length upon the twelfth of <hi>Iuly</hi> 1659. procure the following

                  <head>Answer.</head>
                  <p>This whole Article is a grosse mistake of the Fact: For there were two Contracts, by one whereof 17000. l. was due; whereof the Doctor never received but 10600. By the other Contract about 8000. l. was due, whereof he never received 5500. l. Moreover the defects here mentioned were neither the Doctors faults nor profit: And the useful Overwork, he hath done deserves several thousand pounds in recompence. Lastly, his Bonds and Contract were kept from him above nine moneths longer then they ought to have been, out of abundant caution onely, and at length were delivered by the consent and knowledge of the Councel, the Army, the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turney General &amp; Surveyor General, after many debate concerning the same.</p>

                  <p>What is said to have been paid thrice, was never paid once, and if he hath received any thing which in strictnesse of Law he might not, in Equity and Conscience he ought to have received twice as much for those very things.
