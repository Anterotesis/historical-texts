            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Perceive, you are here as the <hi>Houſe of Parilament,</hi> by your Speaker, whom I ſee here; and by your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, which are, in a great meaſure, known to me. When I firſt met you in this Room, it was, to my apprehenſion, the hopefulleſt day that ever mine eyes ſaw, as to conſiderations of this World: For I did look at (as wrapt up in you, together with my ſelf) the hopes and the happineſs of (though not of the greateſt yet a very great, and) the beſt people in the World; and truely and unfeignedly I thought ſo; as a People that have the higheſt and the cleareſt profeſsion among them, of the greateſt glory (to wit) Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; as a People that have been like other Nations, ſometimes up, and ſometimes down, in our honour in the world, but yet never ſo low, but we might meaſure with other Nations; and a People that have had a ſtamp upon them from God, God having (as it were) ſummed all Our former Glory and Honour, in things that are Glory to Nations in an <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">

we knew one another at home, and are well known abroad.</p>
            <p>And (if I be not very much miſtaken) we were arrived (as I, and truely, as I believe, many others did think) at a very ſafe Port, where we might ſit down, and contemplate the diſpenſations of God, and Our mercies, and might know Our mercies not to have been like to thoſe of the Antients, who did make out their Peace and Proſperity, as they thought, by their own endeavours; who could not ſay, as We, That all Ours were let down to Us from God himſelf, whoſe Appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances and Providences amongſt Us are not be outmatched by any Story.</p>
            <p>Truly this was Our condition and I know nothing elſe we had to do, ſave as <hi>Iſrael</hi> was commanded, in that moſt excellent <hi>Pſalm</hi> of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> Pſal. 78. v.4, 5, 6, 7. <hi>The things which we have heard and known, and our Fathers have told us, we will not hide them from their Children, ſhewing to the Generation to come the praiſe of the Lord, and his ſtrength, and his wonderful works which he hath done; for he eſtabliſhed a Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony in</hi> Iacob, <hi>and appointed a Law in</hi> Iſrael, <hi>which he commended our Fathers that they ſhould make them known to their Children, that the Generation to come might known them, even the Children which ſhould be born, who ſhould ariſe and declare them to their Children, that they might ſet their hope in God, and not forget the workes of God, but keep his Commandments.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This I thought had been a Song and a Work worthy of <hi>England,</hi> whereunto you might have happily invited them, had you had Hearts unto it.</p>
            <p>You had this opportunity fairely delivered unto you; And if a <hi>Hiſtory</hi> ſhall be written of theſe times, and of tranſactions, it will be ſaid (it will not be denyed) but that theſe things that I have ſpoken are true.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Talent</hi> was put into your hands, and I ſhall recure to that which I ſaid at the firſt, I came with very great joy, and contentment, and comfort, the firſt time I met you in this Place: But we and theſe Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are, for the preſent, under ſome diſappointment. If I had purpoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to have plaid the Orator, which I did never affect, nor do, nor I hope ſhall, I doubt not but upon eaſie ſuppoſitions, which I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded every one among you will grant, we did meet upon ſuch hope as thſe.</p>
            <p>I met you a ſecond time here, and I confeſs at that meeting I had much abatement of my hopes, through not a total fruſtration. I confeſs that that which dampt my hopes, ſo ſoon, was ſomewhat that did look <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">

of Affairs did ſavour of a <hi>not-owning</hi> too too much ſavour I ſay of a <hi>not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>owning</hi> the <hi>Authority</hi> that called you hither; but God left us not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out an expedient that gave a ſecond <hi>Poſsibility,</hi> ſhall I ſay, a <hi>poſsibility</hi>? it ſeemed to Me a <hi>probability</hi> of recovering out of that <hi>Diſſatisfied Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition</hi> We were all then in, towards ſome mutuality of <hi>Satisfaction,</hi> and therefore by that <hi>Recognition,</hi> ſuiting with the <hi>Indenture</hi> that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned you hither, to which afterwards alſo was added your own <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration,</hi> conformable to and in acceptance o, that Expedient, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by you had (though with a little check) another opportunity renewed unto you to have made this Nation as happy as it could have been, if every thing had smoothly run on from hatſirct hour of your meeting.</p>
            <p>And indeed (you will give me liberty of my thoughts and hopes) I did think, as I have formerly found in that way that I have been enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged as a Souldier, hat ſome affronts put up in us, ſome diſaſters at the firſt, have made way for very great and happy Succeſſes.</p>
            <p>And I did not at all <hi>deſpond,</hi> but the <hi>Stop</hi> put upon you, would in like manner have made way for a bleſsing from God, that that <hi>Interruption</hi> being, as thought, neceſſary to divert you from deſtructive and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent proceedings, to give time for better Deliberati us; whereby, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the GOVERNMENT as you found it, you might have proceeded to have made thoſe good and wholſome <hi>Laws,</hi> which the People ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected from you, and might have anſwered the <hi>Grievances,</hi> and <hi>ſettled</hi> thoſe other things proper to you as a <hi>Parliament,</hi> and for which you would have had thanks, from all that intruſted you.</p>
            <p>What hath hapned ſince that time, I have not taken publick notice of, as declining to intrench upon <hi>Parliament Priviledges</hi>: For ſure I am, you will all bear me witneſs, that from your entring into the <hi>Houſe</hi> upon the <hi>Recognition,</hi> to this very day, you have had no manner of <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terruption</hi> or <hi>Hindrance</hi> of mine, in proceeding to that bleſſed iſſue the heart of a good man could propoſe to himſelf, to this very day.</p>
            <p>You ſee you have me verie much lockt up as to what you tranſacted among your ſelves from that time to this, but ſomthing I ſhall take li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to ſpeak of to you, As I may not take notice what you have been doing, ſo I think I have a very great liberty to tell you, that I do not know what you have been doing, I do not know whether you have been alive or dead, I have not once <hi>Heard</hi> from you in all this time, I have not, and that you all know: If that be a fault that I have not, ſurely it hath not been mine.</p>
            <p>If I had any <hi>Melancholy thoughts,</hi> and have ſat down by them, why might it not have been very lawful to me to think that I was a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

judged <hi>Vnconcerned</hi> in all theſe buſineſſes: I can aſſure you, I have not reckoned my ſelf, nor did I reckon my ſelf <hi>unconcerned</hi> in you, and ſo long as any <hi>Iuſt patience</hi> could ſupport my expectations, I would have waited to the untermoſt to have received from you the iſſues of your <hi>Conſultations</hi> and <hi>Reſolutions</hi>; I have been careful of your <hi>Safety,</hi> &amp; the <hi>Safety</hi> of thoſe that you repreſented, to whom I reckon my ſelf a Servant.</p>
            <p>But what <hi>Meſſages</hi> have I diſturbed you withall? What <hi>Injury</hi> or <hi>Indignity</hi> hath been done or offered, either to your Perſons, or to any Priviledges of <hi>Parliament,</hi> ſince you ſat? I looked at my ſelf, as ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obliged by my <hi>Oath</hi> ſince your <hi>Recognizing</hi> the GOVERNMENT, in the <hi>Authority</hi> of which you were called hither, and ſate, to give you all poſsible ſecurity, and to keep you from any <hi>un-Parliamentary Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Think you I could not ſay more upon this ſubject, if I liſted to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paciate thereupon; but becauſe my actions plead for me: I ſhall ſay no more of this.</p>
            <p>I ſay, I have been caring for you, your quiet ſitting, caring for your Priviledges (as I ſaid before) that they might not be <hi>Interrupted,</hi> have been ſeeking of God, from the great God, a <hi>Bleſſing</hi> upon you, ſand a <hi>Bleſſing</hi> upon theſe Nations; I have been conſulting, if poſsiblie I might in any thing promote, in my Place, the real good of this <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> of the hopefulneſs of which I have ſaid ſo much unto you.</p>
            <p>And I did think it to be my buſineſs, rather to ſee the utmoſt iſſue, and what God would produce by you, than unſeaſonably to intermed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle with you. But as I ſaid before, I have been caring for you, and for the peace and quiet of the Nations, indeed I have, and that I ſhall a little presently manifeſt unto you.</p>
            <p>And it leadeth me to let you know ſomwhat that I fear, I fear will be through ſome interpretation a little too juſtly put upon you, whileſt you have been imployed as you have been (and in all that time expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the GOVERNMENT, in that GOVERNMENT, I ſay, in that GOVERNMENT) brought forth nothing that you your ſelves ſay can be taken notice of without <hi>infringment</hi> of your <hi>Priviledges.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I will tell you ſomwhat, that (if it be not news to you) I wiſh you had taken very ſerious conſideration of; if it be <hi>news,</hi> I wiſh I had acquainted you with it ſooner: And yet if any man will ask me why I did it not, the Reaſon is given already, becauſe I did make it my buſineſs to give you no <hi>interruption.</hi>

to thrive under the <hi>ſhadow</hi> of other <hi>Trees</hi>: I will tell you what have <hi>thriven,</hi> I will not ſay what you have <hi>cheriſhed</hi> under your <hi>ſhadow,</hi> that were too hard, Inſtead of the <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Settlement,</hi> inſtead of <hi>Mercy</hi> and <hi>Truth</hi> being brought together, <hi>Righteouſneſs and Peace kiſsing each other,</hi> by reconciling the honeſt People of theſe Nation:, and ſettling the woful Diſtempers that are amongſt us, (which had been glorious things, and worthy of <hi>Chriſtians</hi> to have propoſed) <hi>Weeds</hi> and <hi>Nettles, Briars</hi> and <hi>Thorn</hi>; have <hi>thriven</hi> under your <hi>ſhadow,</hi> diſſettlement! and diviſion, diſcontent and diſ-ſatisfaction, together with real dangers to the whole, has been more multiplied within theſe <hi>five Months</hi> of your Sitting, than in ſome <hi>Years</hi> before.</p>
            <p>Foundations have been alſo laid for the future renewing the <hi>Troubles</hi> of theſe Nations, by all the <hi>Enemies</hi> of it <hi>abroad</hi> and at <hi>home</hi>; Let not theſe words ſeem too ſharp, for they are true, as any <hi>Mathematical Demonſtrations</hi> are or can be; I ſay, the <hi>Enemies</hi> of the Peace of theſe Nations abroad and at home, the diſcontented humors throughout theſe Nations, which I think no man will grudg to call by that name, or to make to allude to <hi>Briars</hi> and <hi>Thorns,</hi> they have nouriſhed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves under your <hi>ſhadow.</hi>
            </p>

            <p>Theſe <hi>Weeds, Briars</hi> and <hi>Thorns,</hi> they have been preparing, and have brought their <hi>Deſigns</hi> to ſome maturity, by the advantages given to them, as aforeſaid, from your <hi>Sitting</hi> and <hi>Proceedings</hi>; but by the <hi>wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king ey</hi> that watched over that <hi>Cauſe</hi> that God will bleſs, they have been, and yet are <hi>disappointed.</hi> And having mentioned that <hi>Cauſe,</hi> I ſay that <hi>ſlighted Cauſe,</hi> Let me ſpeak a few words in behalf thereof (though it may ſeem too long a digreſſion) Whoſoever deſpiſeth it, and will ſay it is <hi>Non Cauſa pro Cauſâ,</hi> the all ſearching ey before mentioned will find out that Man, and will judge him, as one that regardeth not the <hi>Works</hi> of God, nor the <hi>operations</hi> of his hands, for which God hath threatened to caſt men down and not build them up; that becauſe he can diſpute, and tell us, He knew not where the <hi>Cauſe</hi> begun, nor where it is, but modelleth it according to his own intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, and ſubmits not to to the <hi>appearances</hi> of God in the World, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he lifts up his heel againſt God, and mocketh at all his providences, laughing at the obſervations made up not without <hi>Reaſon,</hi> and the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> but by the quickening and teaching <hi>Spirit,</hi> which gives life to the other, calling ſuch <hi>obſervations</hi> Enthuſiaſms. Such men, I ſay, no wonder if they ſtumble and fall backward, and be broken, and ſnared, and taken by the things of which they are ſo maliciouſly and wilfully ignorant. The <hi>Scriptures</hi> ſay, The <hi>Rod</hi> has a voice, and he will make himſelf known, and he will make himſelf known by the Judgements which he executeth; and do we not think he will, and does, by the providences of mercy and kindneſs which he hath for his People, and for their juſt Liberties, <hi>whom he loves as the Apple of his Ey</hi>? Doth he not by them manifeſt himſelf? And is he not thereby alſo ſeen, giving <hi>Kingdoms</hi> for them, giving <hi>Men</hi> for them, and <hi>People</hi> for their lives? As it is in the 43. of <hi>Iſaiah</hi> Is not this as fair a Lecture, and as clear ſpeaking, as any thing our dark reaſon left to the Letter of the <hi>Scriptures</hi> can collect from them? By this <hi>voice</hi> has God ſpoken very loud on the behal of his <hi>People,</hi> by <hi>judging</hi> their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies in the late <hi>War,</hi> and reſtoring them a <hi>liberty</hi> to worſhip with the freedom of their <hi>Conſciences,</hi> and freedom in their <hi>Eſtates</hi> and <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons</hi> when they do ſo. And thus we have found the <hi>Cauſe</hi> of God by the <hi>Works</hi> of God, which are the <hi>Teſtimony</hi> of God, upon which <hi>Rock,</hi> whoſoever <hi>spilits</hi> ſhall ſuffer ſhipwrack.</p>
            <p>But it is Our <hi>Glory,</hi> and it is <hi>Mine,</hi> if I have any in the World, concerning the <hi>Intereſt</hi> of thoſe that have an <hi>Intereſt</hi> in a better World;

It is My <hi>Glory</hi> that, I know a <hi>Cauſe,</hi> which yet we have not loſt, but do hope we ſhall take a little pleaſure rather to loſe our <hi>Lives</hi> than loſe. But you will excuſe this long digreſſion.</p>
            <p>I ſay unto you, whilſt you have been in the midſt of theſe <hi>Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions,</hi> that <hi>Party,</hi> that <hi>Cavalier Party,</hi> (I could wiſh ſome of them had thruſt in here to have heard what I ſay) the <hi>Cavalier Party</hi> have been <hi>deſigning</hi> and <hi>preparing</hi> to put this <hi>Nation</hi> in bloud again with a witneſs; but becauſe I am confident there are none of that Sort here, therefore I ſhall ſay the leſs to that; onely this I muſt tell you, they have been making great preparations of <hi>Arms,</hi> and, I do believe, will be made evident to you that they have raked out many thouſands of <hi>Arms,</hi> even all that this City could afford, for divers Months laſt paſt.</p>
            <p>But it will be ſaid, May we not arm Our ſelves for the Defence of our Houſes? will any bodie find fault for that? No, for that, the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of their doing ſo hath been as explicit, and under as clear proof, as the fact of doing ſo, for which I hope, by the <hi>Juſtice</hi> of the Land, ſome will, in the face of the Nation, <hi>Anſwer</hi> it with their lives, and then the buſineſs will be pretty well out of doubt.</p>
            <p>Banks of <hi>Money</hi> have been framing for theſe, and other ſuch like uſes; <hi>Letters</hi> have been iſſued, with <hi>Privie Seals,</hi> to as great Perſons as moſt are in the Nation, for the advance of Moneys, which have been <hi>diſcovered</hi> to <hi>

            <p>It hath not been onely thus; but as in a <hi>Quinzie</hi> or <hi>Pluriſie,</hi> where the humor fixeth in one part, give it ſcope, it will gather to that place, to the hazarding of the whole, and it is natural to do ſo, till it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy nature, in that <hi>Perſon</hi> on whomſoever this befals,</p>
            <p>So likewiſe will thoſe <hi>diſeaſes</hi> take accidental Cauſes of aggravation of their diſtemper; and this was that which I did aſſert, that they have taken <hi>Accidental Cauſes,</hi> for the growing and increaſing of thoſe <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempers,</hi> as much as would have been in the natural body, if timely remedy were nor applied.

            <p>And I muſt ſay, as when <hi>Gideon</hi> commanded his Son to fall upon <hi>Zeba</hi> and <hi>Zalmunna</hi> to ſlay them, they thought it more noble to die by the hand of a <hi>Man,</hi> than of a <hi>Stripling</hi>; which ſhews there is ſome contentment in the <hi>hand</hi> by which a man <hi>falls</hi>: So is it ſome ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, if a <hi>Common-wealth</hi> muſt <hi>periſh</hi> that it <hi>periſh</hi> by <hi>Men,</hi> and not by the hands of perſons differing little from <hi>Beaſts</hi>; That if it muſt needs ſuffer, it ſhould rather ſuffer from <hi>rich men,</hi> than from <hi>poor men,</hi> who, as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaies, <hi>when they oppreſs, they l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">

            <p>What if I ſhould ſay, If there ſhould be a disproportion or disequa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity as to the power, it is on the other hand, and if this be ſo, wherein have you had cauſe to quarrel?

            </p>
            <p>I will not preſage what you have been about, or doing in all this <hi>time,</hi> or do I love to make <hi>Conjectures,</hi> but I muſt tell you this, That as I undertook this <hi>Government</hi> in the ſimplicity of my heart, and as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, and to do the part of an honeſt man, and to be true to the Inereſt which in my <hi>Conſcience</hi> is dear to many of you (though it is <pb n="14" facs="tcp:171250:9"/>
not alwaies underſtood what God in his wiſdom may hide from Us, as to Peace and Settlement) So I can ſay, that no particular Intereſt, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of my <hi>Self, Eſtate, Honour,</hi> or <hi>Family,</hi> are, or have been prevalent with me to this Undertaking.</p>
            <p>For if you had upon the old Government offered to me this one, this one thing, I ſpeak, as thus adviſed, and before God, as having been, to this day of this opinion, and this hath been my conſtant <hi>Judgement,</hi> well known to many that hear me ſpeak, if this one thing had been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted, that one thing, that this <hi>Government</hi> ſhould have been, and placed in my Family <hi>Hereditary</hi> I would have rejected it, and I could have done no other, according to my preſent <hi>Conſcience</hi> and <hi>Light</hi>; I will tell you my reaſon, though I cannot tell what God will do with Me, nor You, nor the Nation, for throwing away precious opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties committed to US.</p>
            <p>This hath been my Principle, and I liked it when this Government came firſt to be propoſed to me, That it put Us off that <hi>Hereditary</hi> way, well looking, that as God had declared what GOVERNMENT he had delivered over to the <hi>Jews,</hi> and placed it upon ſuch perſons as had been inſtrumental for the <hi>Conduct</hi> and <hi>Deliverance</hi> of his People; And con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering that promiſe in <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> That God would <hi>give Rulers as at the firſt, and Iudges as at the beginning,</hi> I did not know, but that God might begin, and though at preſent with a moſt unworthy <hi>Perſon,</hi> yet as to the future, it might be after this manner, and I thought this might uſher it in. I am ſpeaking as to my <hi>Iudgement</hi> againſt making it <hi>Heredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary,</hi> to have men choſen for their <hi>Love to God,</hi> and to <hi>Truth,</hi> and <hi>Iuſtice,</hi> and not to have it <hi>Hereditary</hi>; for as it is in <hi>Eccleſiaſtes Who knoweth whether he may beget a Fool or Wiſe,</hi> honeſt or not, what ever they be muſt come in upon that account, becauſe the <hi>Government</hi> is made a <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this I do perhaps declare with too much <hi>Earneſtneſs,</hi> as being my own <hi>Concernment,</hi> and know not what <hi>Place</hi> it may have in your <hi>Hearts,</hi> and of the good people in the Nation, but however it be, I have comfort in this my truth and plainneſs.</p>
            <p>I have thus told you my thoughts, which truly I have declared to you in the fear of God, as knowing he will not be mocked, and in the ſtrength of God, as knowing and rejoycing that I am kept in my ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; eſpecially when I do not form or frame things without the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs of the <hi>Integrity,</hi> and <hi>Honeſty,</hi> that my own <hi>Conſcience</hi> gives me not the <hi>Ly</hi> to what I ſay, and then in what I ſay I can rejoyce.</p>
            <p>Now to ſpeak a word or two to you, Of that I muſt profeſs in the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:171250:9"/>
name of the ſame Lord, an I wiſh that there had been no cauſe that I ſhould have thus ſpoken to you, and though I have told you, that I came with <hi>Ioy the firſt time,</hi> with ſome <hi>regret the ſecond,</hi> that <hi>now</hi> I ſpeak with <hi>moſt regret</hi> of all.</p>
            <p>I look upon you, as having among you many perſons, that I could lay down my life individually for, I could through the grace of God, deſire to lay down my life for you; So far am I from having an unkind or un-Chriſtian heart towards you, in your particular capacities.</p>
            <p>I have that indeed as a work moſt incumbent upon <hi>Me,</hi> I conſulted what might be <hi>My Duty</hi> in ſuch a <hi>Day</hi> as this, caſting up all Conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations. I muſt confeſs, as I told you, that I did think <hi>occaſionally</hi> this Nation hath <hi>ſuffered</hi> extreamly in the reſpects mentioned, as alſo in the <hi>Disappointments</hi> of their <hi>Expectations</hi> of that <hi>Juſtice</hi> that was due to them by your ſitting thus long; and what have you brought forth?</p>
            <p>I did not, nor cannot apprehend what it is, (I would be loth to call it a <hi>Fate,</hi> that were too <hi>Paganiſh</hi> a Word) but there is ſomething in it, that we have not our Expectations.</p>
            <p>I did think alſo for my ſelf, that I am like to meet with <hi>Difficulties,</hi> and that this Nation will not (as it is fit it ſhould not) be <hi>deluded</hi> with pretexts of <hi>Neceſſity</hi> in that great buſineſs of raiſing of money, and were it not that I can make ſome <hi>Dilemmaes</hi> upon which to reſolve ſome things of my <hi>Conſcience, Judgement,</hi> and <hi>Actions,</hi> I ſhould ſink at the very proſpect of my Encounters; ſome of them are general, ſome are more ſpecial, ſuppoſing this <hi>Cauſe,</hi> or this <hi>Buſineſs</hi> muſt be carried on, either it is of <hi>God,</hi> or of <hi>Man,</hi> if it be of <hi>Man,</hi> I would I had never touched it with a finger; if I had not had a hope fixed in Me that this <hi>Cauſe,</hi> and this <hi>buſineſs</hi> is of God, I would many years ago have run from it. If it be of <hi>God,</hi> he will bear it up. If it be of <hi>Man,</hi> it will tumble, as every thing that hath been of man, ſince the World began, hath done. And what are all our <hi>Hiſtories,</hi> and other <hi>Traditions</hi> of actions in <hi>former times,</hi> but God mani<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>eſting himſelf that he hath <hi>ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken</hi> and <hi>tumbled down,</hi> and <hi>trampled upon</hi> every thing that he hath not <hi>planted</hi>? And as this is, ſo the all-wiſe God deal with it.</p>
            <p>If this be of humane Structure, and invention, and it be an old <hi>Plot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting</hi> and <hi>Contrivance</hi> to bring things to this <hi>Iſſue,</hi> and that they are not the <hi>births of Providence,</hi> then they will tumble. But if the Lord take pleaſure in <hi>England,</hi> and if he will do Us good, he is able to bear us up; Let the difficulties be whatſoever they will, we ſhall in his Strength be
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:171250:10"/>
able to encounter with them. And I bleſs God I have been inured to <hi>Difficulties,</hi> and I never found God <hi>failed</hi> when I <hi>truſted</hi> in him; I can laugh and ſing in my heart when I ſpeak of theſe things to you, or elſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where. And though ſome may think it an hard thing without <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liamentary Authority</hi> to raiſe <hi>money</hi> upon this <hi>Nation</hi>; yet I have an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Argument to the good people of this Nation, if they would be ſafe, and have no better <hi>Principle</hi>; whether they prefer the having of their <hi>Will,</hi> though it be their <hi>Deſtruction,</hi> rather than comply with things of neceſſity; that will excuſe me, but I ſhould wrong my na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Countrey to ſuppoſe this.</p>
            <p>For I look at the People of theſe Nations, as the bleſſing of the Lord, and they are a People bleſſed by God. They have been ſo, and they will be ſo by reaſon of that <hi>immortal ſeed,</hi> which hath been, &amp; is amongſt them, thoſe regenerated ones in the Land, of ſeveral Judgements, who are all the Flock of Chriſt, and Lambs of Chriſt, though perhaps under many unruly paſſions, and troubles of Spirit, whereby they give dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet to themſelves and others; yet they are not ſo to God, as to Us, he is a God of other patience, and he will own the leaſt of truth in the hearts of his People, and the people being the bleſſing of God they will not be ſo angry, but they will prefer their ſafety to their paſſions, and their real ſecurity to forms, when neceſſity calls for ſupplies; had they not well been acquainted with this principle, they had never ſeen this day of Goſpel-Liberty.</p>
            <p>But if any man ſhall object, It is an eaſie thing to talk of neccſſities when men create neceſſities; would not the <hi>Lord Protector</hi> make Himſelf great, and his Familie great? doth not He make theſe neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties? and then he will come upon the People with this Argument of neceſſitie.</p>
            <p>This were ſomething hard indeed, but I have not yet known what it is to make neceſſities, whatſoever the Judgements or thoughts of men are. And I ſay this, not onely to this Aſſembly, but to the World, that that man liveth not, that can come to me, and charge me that I have in theſe great Revolutions made neceſſities; I challenge even all that fear God: And as God hath ſaid. <hi>My glory I will not give unto another,</hi> Let men take heed, and be twice adviſed, how they call his Revolutions, the things of God, and his working of things from one Period to another, how I ſay, they call them neceſſities of mens crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for by ſo doing they do vilifie and leſſen the works of God, and
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:171250:10"/>
rob him of his Glory, which he hath ſaid, he <hi>will not give unto another,</hi> nor ſuffer to be taken from him. We know what God did to <hi>Herod</hi> when he was applauded, and did not acknowledge GOD; And GOD knoweth what he will do with men when they ſhall call His Revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, humane Deſigns, and ſo detract from his Glory, when they have not been forecaſt, but ſudden Providences in things, whereby Carnal and Worldly men are enraged, and under, and at which many I fear (ſome good) have murmured and repined, becauſe disappointed of their miſtaken Fancies; but ſtill they have been the wiſe diſpoſings of the Almighty, though Inſtruments have had their paſſions and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>l<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; and I think it is an Honor to God to acknowledge the neceſſities to have been of Gods impoſing, when truely they have been ſo, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed they have, when we take our ſin in our actings to ourſelves, and much more ſafe, than judge things ſo contingent, as if there were not a God that ruled the Earth.</p>
            <p>We know the Lord hath poured this Nation from Veſſel to Veſſel, till he poured it into your Lap, when you came firſt together: I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident, that it came ſo into your hands, was not judged by you to be from Counterfeited, or feigned neceſſity, but by Divine Providence and Diſpenſation. And this I ſpeak with more earneſtneſs, becauſe I ſpeak for God, and not for men; I would have any man to come and tell of the transactions that have been, and of thoſe periods of time, wherein God hath made theſe <hi>Revolutions,</hi> and find where they can fix a feigned neceſſity.</p>
            <p>I could recite particulars, if either My ſtrength would ſerve Me to ſpeak, or yours to hear; if that you would revolve the great hand of God in his great Diſpenſations, you would find that there is ſcarce a man that fell off at any period of time when God had any work to do, that can give God or his work, at this day, a good word.</p>
            <p>It was, ſay ſome, the cunning of the Lord Protector (I take it to my ſelf) it was the craft of ſuch a man, and his plot that hath brought it about. And as they ſay in other Countreys, There are five or ſix cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning men in <hi>England</hi> that have <hi>skill,</hi> they do all theſe things: Oh what <hi>Blaſphemy</hi> is this! becauſe men <hi>that are without God in the World,</hi> and Walk not with him, and know not what it is to <hi>pray,</hi> or <hi>believe,</hi> and to <hi>receive</hi> return from God, and to be <hi>spoken</hi> unto by the Spirit of God, who <hi>Speaks</hi> without a written Word ſometimes, yet according to it: God hath ſpoken heretofore <hi>in divers manners,</hi> let him ſpeak as he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth.
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:171250:11"/>
Hath he not given us <hi>liberty</hi>? nay is it not our dutie to go to the <hi>Law and to the Teſtimonies,</hi> and there we ſhall find that there have been impreſſions in extraordinary caſes, as well without the written Word as with it, and therefore there is no difference in the thing thus aſſerted, from truths generally received, except we will exclude the <hi>Spirit,</hi> without whoſe concurrence all other Teachings are <hi>ineffectual</hi>; He doth ſpeak to the Hearts and Conſciences of men, and leadeth them to his Law and Teſtimonies, and there he ſpeaks to them, and ſo gives them double teachings, according to that of Job. <hi>God ſpeaketh once, yea twice</hi>; and that of David, <hi>God hath ſpoken once, yea twice have I heard this.</hi> Thoſe men that live upon their <hi>Mumpſimus</hi> and <hi>Sumpſimus,</hi> their <hi>Maſſes</hi> and <hi>Service-Books,</hi> their dead and carnal Worſhip, no marvel if they be <hi>ſtrangers</hi> to God, and the <hi>works</hi> of God, and to <hi>ſpiritual dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations.</hi> And becauſe they ſay and believe thus, muſt we do ſo too? we in this <hi>Land</hi> have been otherwiſe inſtructed, even by the <hi>Word,</hi> and <hi>Works,</hi> and <hi>Spirit</hi> of God.</p>
            <p>To ſay that <hi>men</hi> bring forth theſe things, when <hi>God</hi> doth them, judg you if God will bear this. I wiſh that every ſober heart, though he hath had temptations upon him of deſerting this CAUSE of God, yet may take heed how he provokes, and <hi>falls into the hands of the living God</hi> by ſuch Blaſphemies as theſe, according to the 10<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of the <hi>Hebrews, If we ſin wilfully after that we have received the knowledge of the truth, there remains no more ſacrifice for ſin</hi> (it was ſpoken to the Jews, that having profeſſed Chriſt apoſtatized from him) what then? nothing but <hi>a fearful falting into the hands of the Living God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They that ſhall <hi>attribute</hi> to this or that <hi>perſon</hi> the contrivances and production of thoſe mighty things God hath wrought in the midſt of us, and that they have not been the revolutions of Chriſt himſelf, upon whoſe <hi>Shoulders</hi> the GOVERNMENT is laid, they ſpeak againſt God, and they fall under his hand without a Mediator, that is, if we deny the <hi>Spirit</hi> of Jeſus Chriſt the <hi>glory</hi> of all his works in the world, by which he <hi>Rules</hi> Kingdoms, and doth <hi>adminiſter,</hi> and is the <hi>Rod</hi> of his ſtrength, we provoke the Mediator; And he may ſay, I'll leave you to God, I'll not intercede for yon, let him tear you to pieces, I'll leave thee to fall into Gods hands, thou denieſt me my Soveraignty and Power commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to me, I'll not intercede nor mediate for thee, thou falleſt into the hands of the living God. Therefore whatſoever you may judge <hi>men</hi> for, and ſay, This man is cunning, and politick, and ſubtil; take heed,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:171250:11"/>
again I ſay, how you judge of his <hi>revolutions,</hi> as the <hi>products</hi> of <hi>mens</hi> inventions.</p>
            <p>I may be thought to preſs too much upon this Theme, but pray God it may ſtick upon your hearts and mine; the <hi>worldly minded man</hi> knows nothing of this, but is a ſtranger to it, and becauſe of this his <hi>Atheiſm</hi> and <hi>murmurings</hi> at <hi>inſtruments,</hi> yea <hi>repining</hi> at <hi>God himſelf</hi>; and no wonder, conſidering the Lord hath done ſuch things amongſt us as have not been known in the world theſe 1000 years, and yet not withstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is not owned by us.</p>
            <p>There is another neceſſity which you have put upon us, and we have not ſought; I appeal to God, Angels, and Men, if I ſhall raiſe Money according to the Article in the GOVERNMENT which had power to call you hether, and did, and inſtead of ſeaſonable providing for the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, you have labored to overthrow the GOVERNMENT, and the <hi>Army</hi> is now upon <hi>Free-Quarter,</hi> and you would never ſo much as let me hear a tittle from you concerning it, where is the fault? has it not been as if you had had a purpoſe to put this extremity upon us and the Nation? I hope this was not in your minds, I am not willing to judge ſo; but this is the ſtate unto which we are reduced: By the <hi>Deſigns</hi> of ſome in the <hi>Army</hi> who are now in <hi>Cuſtody,</hi> it was <hi>deſigned</hi> to get as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them as could, through discontent for want of money, the Army being in a Barren Countrey, near Thirty weeks behind in pay, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on other ſpecious pretences, to march for <hi>England</hi> out of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and in discontent to <hi>ſeiz,</hi> their <hi>General</hi> there, a faithful and honeſt man, that ſo another might head the Army, and all this opportunity taken from your delays, whether will this be a thing of feigned <hi>neceſsity</hi>? What could it ſignifie but that the Army are in <hi>diſcontent</hi> already, and wee'l make them live upon <hi>ſtones,</hi> wee'l make them caſt off their <hi>Governours</hi> and <hi>Diſcipline</hi>? What can be ſaid to this? I liſt not to unſaddle my ſelf, and put the fault upon others backs; Whether it hath been for the good of <hi>England</hi> whileſt men have been talking of this thing or the other, and pretending <hi>liberty,</hi> and a many good words whether it hath been as it ſhould have been? I am confident you cannot think it has, the Nation will not think ſo. And if the worſt ſhould be made of things, I know not what the <hi>Corniſh men,</hi> or the <hi>Lincolnſhire men</hi> may think, or other Counties, but I believe they will all think they are not ſafe. A temporary ſuſpenſion of caring for the greateſt <hi>Liberties</hi> and privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges (if it were ſo, which is denied) would not have been of
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:171250:12"/>
that damage, that the not providing againſt <hi>Free Quarter</hi> hath run the Nation upon. And if it be my <hi>liberty</hi> to walk abroad in the <hi>Fields,</hi> or to take a <hi>Iourney,</hi> yet it is not my wiſdom to do ſo when my <hi>Houſe is on fire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have troubled you with a long <hi>Speech,</hi> and I believe it may not have the ſame reſentment with all that it hath with ſome: But becauſe that is unknown to me, I ſhall leave it to God, and conclude with that, that I think my ſelf bound in my <hi>Duty</hi> to God and the People of theſe Nations, to their <hi>ſafety</hi> and <hi>good</hi> in every <hi>reſpect.</hi> I think it my duty to tell you, That it is not for the <hi>profit</hi> of theſe Nations, nor for <hi>Common</hi> and <hi>Publick good,</hi> for You to continue here any longer, and therefore, I do Declare unto you, <hi>THAT I DO DISSOLVE THIS PAR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LIAMENT.</hi>
