         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

any decency decline the
Publication of this
Sermon, which had
been by you so earnestly
desired, then, when the greatnesse of
your Love and respects to my Person,
and function, did for many dayes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse
it self in a most free and noble
Reception: yet it pleased Divine
providence, by a sore visitation on my
Family, to obstruct the performance
<pb facs="tcp:48898:3"/>
of this Service, so long, till I might
justly have hoped to have been no more
minded of it. But being disappointed
in that hope, I now, though late, send
it forth, without altering any one Line
or period of what I then delivered.
And although it be but a very Slen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Return for the great favours I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
from you alone, yet I must
crave your leave to professe, That as
a Ring, though placed only on a finger
is yet a token of Love to the whole per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son;
so this little Sermon, though de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated
only to you, is intended as a
Testimony of that Honour &amp; Thanks
which I owe to all Orders in this great
Diocese, for those signal and publick
favours, which, in mine attendance
on the service thereof, I every where
received. All the Answer I can
<pb facs="tcp:48898:3"/>
make to so great an Obligation, is dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to pray, That the Church of Christ
in this large Diocese, may be beautifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with the blessings of Truth and
Peace, of Vnity and Holinesse; That
the Clergy thereof may with all fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
deliver the Word of Gods grace,
and that it may by his effectual opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
have a free and successfull pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage
into the hearts and lives of the
people committed to their Charge.
And as this is the Continual Prayer,
so I hope, that through the Assistance of
Divine Grace, it shall be the unwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
Endeavour of him who desires to
approve himself</p>

actions was <hi>but a Type.</hi> He <hi>threatneth</hi>

Touching this Administration of Fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
the Flock, we shall briefly open,
1. The <hi>Necessity of this Pastoral office,</hi> both
supreme in the Chief Shepherd, and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate
in his servants and inferiour Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters.
2. The <hi>particular Duties</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the discharge of our pastoral Office
doth stand, which the supreme Shepherd
is pleased to second with his powerfull
and most efficacious Cooperation.</p>
            <p>Necessity is Twofold. <hi>Absolute,</hi> as
it is absolutely necessary for the first Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to Be. <hi>Relative</hi> or <hi>Hypothetical,</hi>
when one thing is necessary in order un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
or upon supposition of another.
<hi>Obedience</hi> unto God is a <hi>Necessary duty</hi>
to be done, <hi>Blessedness,</hi> a <hi>necessary End</hi> to
be pursued; <hi>unto the performance</hi> of this
Duty, there is a <hi>necessity</hi> to know the
<hi>Rule</hi> wherein it is prescribed: unto the
<hi>obtaining</hi> of this <hi>End</hi> there is a Neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
to know the <hi>Means</hi> whereby it may
be promoted; for understanding where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
we shall premise two or three Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:48898:8"/>
1. Though there remain <hi>some ingraf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
notions</hi> of the Law of Nature touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
God and a service due to him in the
heart of Man, yet that Law is much <hi>dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
and defaced</hi> by that sinfull Corruption
which doth as well <hi>indispose the minde</hi> as
any other faculties unto its due operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
<hi>Of this blindness and vanity</hi> we have
frequent mention, 1 <hi>Cor. 2 14. Ephes.</hi> 4.
17, 18. and therefore albeit rare things are
recorded of the <hi>moral Vertues</hi> of many
Heathen men, and though diverse of
their Philosophers, <hi>Plato, Aristotle, Hiero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,
Plutarch, Cicero, Seneca, Epictetus<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi>
and others have written excellently on
those Arguments, yet unto a <hi>full knowledge</hi>
of Moral Duties to be in a due manner
performed unto God and Men, there
is <hi>necessary a further patefaction</hi> of the
Divine will, then those remaining Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
of the Law of Nature can dictate
unto us. And this was done <hi>by the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery
of Moses,</hi> by whom to the Church,
and unto whom by the Ministery of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
the most holy and perfect Law
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:48898:9"/>
of God was fully discovered.</p>
            <p>2. Though the Law delivered by <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi>
be pure and perfect, though it be Holy,
Just, and Good, and though the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
thereof be Exceeding Broad, yet
<hi>thereby Salvation cannot</hi> be had, since by
the Law is the <hi>knowledge of Sinne,</hi> Rom:
3. 20. and therefore it <hi>can Curse</hi> onely
and not Blesse or Save us, as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
argues, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 10, 11. All <hi>that the
Law</hi> can do is <hi>to shew us duty,</hi> to disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<hi>the sinne</hi> whereby we come short of
duty, the <hi>punishment</hi> due unto that sin,
and <hi>our Impotency</hi> to prevent, remove, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure,
or avoid that Curse. And Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
there must be a further patefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of life and grace by another Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet.</p>
            <p>3 The doctrine of the Gospel as it
stands formally distinguished from the
doctrine of the Law, is <hi>wholly Mysterious
and supernatural,</hi> there are <hi>no seminal noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi>
in the minde of man from whence it
may by rational disquisition be deduced.
And therefore it is usually in Scripture
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:48898:9"/>
called a <hi>Mysterie,</hi> the Mysterie <hi>of Christ,</hi>
Eph. 3. 4. Col. 4. 3. the Mystery <hi>of the
Gospel,</hi> Eph. 6. 19. of the <hi>Faith,</hi> of <hi>God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness,</hi>
1 Tim. 3. 9. 16. <hi>Hidden from ages
and generations.</hi> Rom. 16. 25. <hi>which eye
hath not seen, nor ear heard, nor hath entred
into the heart of man to conceive,</hi> 1 Cor.
2. 9. as a Mysterie, <hi>Above Natural</hi> Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
as a Mysterie of Godlinesse <hi>against
Carnal</hi> Reason. Except therefore it had
been by some Pastor Revealed to the
Church, wee could never have had the
knowledge of it.</p>
            <p>4 Unto the perfecting of Salvation
by the Gospel Two things Concurre.
A <hi>Valid Impetration</hi> of Grace by the
Merit of Christ. And an <hi>Effectual Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation</hi>
thereof by his Spirit, which he
doth <hi>by begetting Faith</hi> in us, called the
faith of the Operation of God, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 12.
This knowledge of Christ is <hi>Simply ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary</hi>
to Salvation, <hi>Isay 53. 11. Joh. 8
24</hi> And it is <hi>not of our selves,</hi> but the
<hi>Gift of God,</hi> Eph. 2. 8. and God works
it by <hi>Hearing,</hi> Rom. 10. 17. So there is
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:48898:10"/>
a <hi>Necessity of a Divine Pastor,</hi> by whose
teaching this knowledge so necessary to
Salvation may be effectually wrought in
us.</p>
            <p>5. The doctrine of Redemption lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
an <hi>Obligation on the Redeemed</hi> to live
unto him that bought them. Christ
therefore died and rose, that he <hi>might
be the Lord</hi> of dead and living; the Grace
which bringeth Salvation, <hi>Teacheth to
Deny ungodliness,</hi> &amp;c. Tit. 2. 11, 12.
<hi>Sanctification</hi> is necessary to Salvation,
as being <hi>the Inchoation</hi> thereof. Nothing
can be perfected till it be begun, <hi>Heb. 12.
14. Since therefore Holinesse is Necessary,</hi>
and it <hi>belongs to him</hi> to whom this Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
is due <hi>to prescribe the manner of it,</hi>
and since we have naturally in us <hi>Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
Impotency,</hi> and <hi>Enmity,</hi> wholly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abling
from the doing of it, there is upon
these Accompts an Absolute <hi>Necessity</hi> of
such a Pastor who <hi>may Reveal</hi> the Right
way of <hi>Holinesse</hi> unto us, and may <hi>effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caciously
incline</hi> our wills thereunto. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
these Grounds we may see the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:48898:10"/>
of the Great Pastor <hi>for Revealing</hi>
the supernatural <hi>Mysteries</hi> of Life and
Salvation by Free grace, <hi>for working
Faith</hi> whereby Life and Salvation may
be applied unto us, for <hi>Enabling</hi> us un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the duties of Holinesse, and <hi>remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving</hi>
those Impediments of Ignorance,
Impotency, and Enmity, which indis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
us thereunto.</p>
            <p>And now because the <hi>Office of Inferior
Pastors</hi> under this great Shepherd hath
in these late unhappy and licentious
dayes by the subtilty, or rather bung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of Satan been greatly oppos'd, It
will not be unseasonable to speak a <hi>little</hi>
of the <hi>Necessity</hi> of these also to feed the
flock.</p>
            <p>That which God hath appointed <hi>as an
Office</hi> in his Church, is to be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
Necessary. God hath by his spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
Institution <hi>appointed Pastors and Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers</hi>
in his Church, whose function
the Scripture owneth as an Office, called
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> &amp; <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, 1 Tim: 3. 1. Col. 4
17. therefore they are to be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:48898:11"/>
Necessary. The Lord is said to
have <hi>set</hi> or constituted them in his
Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 1 Cor. 12. 28. to have <hi>given
them</hi> to her as part of her Dowry, <hi>Eph:</hi>
4. 11. they are <hi>sent forth</hi> by the Lord
of the harvest, <hi>Matth.</hi> 9<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 38. They are
called <hi>Ministers of Christ,</hi> Col. 1. 7. They
receive their Ministery <hi>from the Lord,</hi>
Col. 4. 17. He hath <hi>made them Overseers</hi>
Acts 20. 28. Therefore none can with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Sacriledge against Christ and his
Church reject them.</p>
            <p>2. Necessary <hi>Ordinances</hi> presuppose
necessary <hi>Officers</hi> to administer them.
Christ hath appointed necessary Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances
to be to the End of the world
administred; therefore the Officers who
are to administer them are Necessary
likewise. He did <hi>not appoint a work</hi> to
be done, and leave it to the wide world
who should do it, but committed the
Ministry of Reconciliation to <hi>Stewards</hi>
and <hi>Ambassadors</hi> by him selected for that
Service, 1 Cor. 4. 1. 2 Cor. 5. 19.</p>
            <p>3. That which was Instituted for
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:48898:11"/>
Necessary Ends, so long as those Ends
continue must be Necessary likewise;
The Office of the Ministry was <hi>Institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
for Necessary Ends,</hi> which do and
will still continue; therefore the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery
by which they are to be promoted
is still to continue. Those Ends are
The <hi>proclaiming Repentance and Remissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
of Sins, the bringing <hi>Glad tydings</hi> of
Good things, the <hi>turning men from dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to light, and from the power of Satan
unto God,</hi> the <hi>saving</hi> of souls, the <hi>perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting</hi>
of Saints, the Edifying the body of
Christ, the <hi>nourishing</hi> of men in the
words of faith, the <hi>speaking</hi> a word in
season to the weary, to shew forth the
Lords death till he come; These and
such like great and weighty workes
the Apostle calleth <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>Eph.</hi>
4. 12. So long as these works remain to
be done, the ministery whereby they
are to be done must remain likewise.</p>
            <p>But it may be <hi>Objected, others may
promote</hi> these Ends as well as Ministers;
all Beleevers are commanded to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:48898:12"/>
Support, Edifie one another,
1 <hi>Thess. 5. 11. 14. Jud. v.</hi> 20. therefore
no need of such an Office for the doing
of them.</p>
            <p>We answer, Although every private
Christian in his place and station ought
to minister grace to the Hearers, to have
his speeches seasoned with Salt, and fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to the use of edifying, yet these great
Works are not done with the same au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
efficacy, certainty, or order, by
a private hand as by publick Officers.</p>
            <p>1 Not with the same <hi>Authority.</hi> A
<hi>Learned Lawyer</hi> may resolve a mans
Case as truly <hi>as a Judge;</hi> but when he
hath a Sentence declared by the Judge,
this doth more assure and quiet him,
because it is a <hi>Sentence</hi> not only of
truth <hi>but of authority.</hi> Ministers speak
and exhort and rebuke with Authority,
<hi>Tit.</hi> 2. 15.</p>
            <p>2 Not with the same <hi>Efficacy;</hi> for
the Lord hath made them <hi>Able Ministers</hi>
2 Cor. 3. 6. furnished them <hi>with power</hi>
for Edification, 2 Cor. 13. 10. an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>annexed
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:48898:12"/>
a special <hi>promise of Blessing</hi> unto
their service, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 20. the Gospel
ministred by them is not in word only
<hi>but in power,</hi> 1 Thess. 1. 5. not <hi>declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi>
only, <hi>but operative,</hi> they being there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<hi>workers together with God,</hi> 1 Cor. 3. 9.
2 Cor. 6. 1.</p>
            <p>3 Not with the same <hi>Certainty;</hi> for
How can it be expected that the Cases
and Conditions of particular Conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
should be so well looked after <hi>by pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Men</hi> who have Callings of their own
to divert them, <hi>as by those whose whole
work</hi> it is to oversee the Souls com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to their Charge, to whom they
may in every case of difficulty resort for
Counsel? Or <hi>how can I expect ordinarily
as full Satisfaction</hi> from a private Brother,
as from one whose duty it is to give him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
wholly to these things, whose Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
Businesse it is to give attendance to
reading, to exhortation, to doctrine, to
meditate on them, to take heed unto
them, to continue in them, that his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiting
may appear to all? 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 13. 16.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:48898:13"/>
4 Not with the same <hi>Order;</hi> God is
in all his works, much more in his Church
a God of Order, 1 Cor. 14. 33. <hi>If the
Apostles</hi> themselves found it difficult to
attend the <hi>Word of God, and Tables,</hi> Acts
6. 2. It cannot but be much <hi>more difficult
for private Brethren</hi> to attend their own
domestical callings, and the publick
concernments of the Church of God.
If a great <hi>Apostle</hi> said <hi>Who is sufficient for
these things,</hi> 2 Cor: 3. 16. shall we judge
<hi>private persons</hi> fit enough for them? If
in the Body God hath set <hi>several Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers</hi>
for several uses; shall we think so
weighty, difficult, and important a ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
as publishing the glad tydings of
Salvation, should be intrusted at large
in every hand, and no peculiar Officers
set apart for the dispensing of it?</p>
            <p>4. We may inferre this Necessity from
the <hi>Titles</hi> given by God unto these his
Officers; they are called <hi>Angels,</hi> Rev. 1
20. <hi>Ambassadors</hi> entrusted with the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistery
of Reconciliation, 2 Cor. 5. 20
<hi>Stewards</hi> of the mysteries of God,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:48898:13"/>
1 Cor. 4. 1, 2. <hi>Watchmen</hi> and Overseers
of the flock, Ezek. 3. 17. Acts 20. 28
<hi>Shepherds,</hi> 1 Pet. 5. 3. <hi>Teachers</hi> distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished
from the people taught, Gal.
6. 6. <hi>Preachers</hi> sent to publish peace,
Rom. 10. 14. <hi>Builders, Planters, Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandmen,
Scribes</hi> instructed for the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of God. All which Metaphorical
expressions import <hi>Services</hi> of absolute
<hi>Necessity</hi> in States and families. There
are <hi>mutual and reciprocal Duties</hi> injoyned
by God upon them and the people, <hi>they
to watch</hi> over the flock, and <hi>these to love,
honour,</hi> esteem and encourage them. If
they be not necessary Officers in the
Church, why should there lie upon them
<hi>so severe a Charge,</hi> why should there be
due unto them so <hi>great a respect?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>5 They whom the Apostles took
Order to be provided for the service of
the Church, are necessary Officers there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of;
for had they been superfluous, they
would not have burdened the Church
with them. But the <hi>Apostles took special
Order</hi> for the <hi>succession</hi> of Ministers in

the Church, they <hi>Ordained</hi> Elders them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
Acts 14. 23. they <hi>directed Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy</hi>
and <hi>Titus</hi> to do so too, 2 Tim. 2. 2.
Tit. 1. 5. they <hi>call upon them</hi> to attend
their service, Col. 4. 17. 1 Pet. 5. 1, 3.
they <hi>call upon others</hi> to obey and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
them, Heb. 13. 17. Gal. 6. 6. Now
certainly they would not have taken all
this Care, nor put the Church to so
much duty and charge, if the Office
were not necessary to the Good and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
of the Church.</p>
            <p>Adde hereunto the <hi>uninterrupted pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription</hi>
of all ages; for not to menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the <hi>Heathen</hi> Nations, where we find
persons separated for divine worship, in

6. 2. in <hi>Lycaonia,</hi> Acts 14. 13. Such
were the <hi>Chaldeans</hi> in <hi>Babylon,</hi> the <hi>Magi</hi>
amongst the <hi>Persians,</hi> the <hi>Brachmanni</hi>
amongst the <hi>Indians,</hi> the <hi>Druidae</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
the <hi>Gaules,</hi> the <hi>Pontifices, Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures,

a Prophet, <hi>Noah</hi> a Preacher, <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>
a Prophet, <hi>Melchisedeck</hi> a Priest, of
the <hi>order of Priests and Levites</hi> in <hi>Israel,</hi>
before whom the first-born of the chief
of the Families did bear that Honor; for
we read of Priests before the Levitical
Order was instituted, Exod. 19. 22.
After that the <hi>Evangelical</hi> Ministry <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
in John, continued in the Twelve Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
and Seventy Elders, held on in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant

own order. <hi>If Jephte his prescription of</hi>
300 years possession was a good plea,

of 1600.</p>
            <p>And now, dear Brethren, since our
office is of so great necessity to the
Church of God, it greatly concerneth
us <hi>to be duly therewith affected, with all
fear and trembling</hi> to discharge so impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
duties for the administration where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
this function hath been divinely insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted,
<hi>By the Holiness and Exemplariness</hi>
of our Lives, by the <hi>Evidence, authority,</hi>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:48898:16"/>
and <hi>purity</hi> of our Doctrine, to <hi>keep our
selves above the Contempt</hi> of men, not to
suffer any to <hi>despise</hi> us, to <hi>magnifie</hi> our
office, and to bear up that <hi>double Honour</hi>
which the Lord hath awarded unto those
that Labour in the Word and Doctrine.
That in all things shewing our selves <hi>pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terns</hi>
of good works, In <hi>our Doctrine
shewing</hi> incorruptnesse, gravity, sincerity,
sound speech which cannot be condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
men that are against us may be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shamed
having no Evil thing to say of
us. And this leadeth to the Second thing
proposed, the Consideration of the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
wherein the discharge of this Pasto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
office doth stand.</p>
            <p>The word <hi>Feed</hi> is an usual <hi>Metaphore</hi>
to expresse the <hi>tender Care and Gentle</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
which men are to exercise o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

a <hi>Synecdoche</hi> of the part for the

put for all the rest. Here then we
might enter into a large field, 1. In o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening
the <hi>Pastoral Office of Christ,</hi> as he
came to <hi>Seek</hi> and to save his Lost sheep;
to <hi>Rule</hi> them by his royal authority; to

Sacrifices of prayers and praises</hi> in

Evangelical;</hi> for though we Preach
<hi>the Law,</hi> yet it is ever <hi>in a subserviency</hi>
unto the Gospel, that by the <hi>Convictions</hi>
thereof we may betake our selves unto
<hi>Christ for shelter from the Curse</hi> which the
Law threatneth, and <hi>for Grace</hi> unto the
<hi>duties</hi> which the Law prescribeth. Our
Saviour seemeth unto me to dictate the
right Method of preaching the Gospel in
that <hi>three-fold Conviction</hi> of Sin, Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse,
and Judgement, John 16. 8,
9, 10.</p>
            <p>1. The Spirit accompanying the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
of the Gospel doth convince men
<hi>of their sinne,</hi> and the wrath due unto
them for the same, <hi>untill they shall believe</hi>
in Christ, for the wrath of God abideth
on unbelievers, John 3. 36. 8. 24. <hi>Till
Faith transferr the sinne</hi> upon the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:48898:21"/>
it remains upon the sinner. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
the Soul is awakened, and the Heart
shaken and made <hi>restlessly Inquisitive</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
some way of escape from the wrath
to come, Acts 2. <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>7.</p>
            <p>2. The Spirit by the Gospel convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth
of <hi>Righteousness</hi> in Christ, who al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit
he was reckoned amongst Malefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors,
John 19. 7. Isay 53. 12. yet
there was in him <hi>Righteousness abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
enough to justifie</hi> and save to the uttermost
all that come unto God by him, in
as much as having finished the work of
Redemption on earth, he is <hi>gone to his
Father,</hi> and is <hi>not sent back</hi> again, but is
sat down at his right hand, pleading the
propitiation which here he wrought. In
<hi>his death</hi> believers <hi>suffered,</hi> 2 Cor. 5. 14.
Rom. 6. 6. In his <hi>Resurrection</hi> they were
<hi>justified,</hi> Rom. 4. 25. and In his <hi>Ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion</hi>
they have a virtual possession of
Heaven, Eph. 2. 6.</p>
            <p>3. The Spirit by the Gospel convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth
of <hi>Judgement,</hi> whereby I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
<hi>Debitum Subjectionis</hi> unto Christ,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:48898:22"/>
as a Judge or Prince to whom all Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
Authority and power is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
John 5. 22. 27. Matth. 28. 18
that we having been delivered from the
wrath to come, and having received so
great a Gift as the Righteousnesse of
Christ, ought to <hi>be subject</hi> unto him,
who <hi>died and rose</hi> again that he might be
Lord both of the dead and living, Rom:
14. 9. having <hi>demolished</hi> the kingdom
of Satan, and <hi>Judicially</hi> cast out, or <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throned</hi>
the Prince of this world, John 12
31. and destroyed him, Heb. 2. 15. so
that being translated from the power of
darknesse into the kingdom of Christ,
Acts 26. 18. Col. 1. 13. we ought to
be <hi>reduced unto the obedience</hi> of Christ,
2 Cor. 10. 5. and to observe and doe
<hi>whatsoever he commandeth,</hi> Mat. 28. 20
for the doctrine of Grace and Salvation
is a <hi>doctrine of Holiness,</hi> Tit. 2. 11. 14.</p>
            <p>In <hi>this Method</hi> ought the Gospel of
Salvation to be preached, <hi>that neither</hi>
the discovery of <hi>sinne</hi> may <hi>drive men un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
despair,</hi> but cause them to flye for San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:48898:22"/>
unto the Righteousness of Christ
and free Grace of God in him; and that
the <hi>magnifying of Free Grace</hi> and the Gift
of Christs Righteousnesse, <hi>may not induce
a neglect of Holiness,</hi> Rom. 6. 1, 2, 14 15,
but that the Love of Christ may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain
them not henceforth to live unto
themselves, but unto him that died for
them and rose again, 2 Cor. 5. 14.</p>
            <p>Now for the Manner how this part of
the Ministery of Reconciliation is to be
be dispensed; we are to preach the word</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Demonstratively,</hi>

concealing any part of Gods Counsel, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
haply it may be unwelcom to those

is <hi>as nails, goods, arrows, a two edg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

            <p>5 Meekly, affectionately, <hi>with all

Love and tenderness</hi> to the souls of our

            <p>6 Plainly, without unnecessary affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
or ostentation of the Enticing
words of mans wisdom, or of meer hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
and exotick wit or learning. The
Apostle, though a great Scholar, would
not ground the faith of his hearers upon
the wisdom of men, but upon the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er

them to take heed of those who would
spoyl them through Philosophy and vain

may make use of Humane wit or learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

is a <hi>noble Gift</hi> of God. It was the
<hi>Honour of Moses</hi> that he was learned in

of the <hi>Heathen Poets,</hi> and as I may so
speak, bringing those Greeks into the
Temple.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:48898:26"/>
And for <hi>Wit,</hi> though it be naturally a
proud and unruly thing, yet it may be so
<hi>sanctifyed</hi> by Grace, and <hi>fixed by humility,</hi>
as to be of great use to the Church of
God. The <hi>Holy Scripture</hi> is <hi>full of cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Elegancies</hi> and Paranomasies of this
kind, and some have written just vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes
<hi>de Rhetorica sacra,</hi> of these Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
Elegancies. What higher strain
of wit could be used then that Acts 5.
41. they went away rejoycing <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
that they were Honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
with dishonour for the name of
Christ? Which <hi>of the noblest Orators</hi> or
Poets amongst the Heathen can parallel
that expression of the Apostle touching
the Glory to come, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>.
2 Cor. 4. 17. It were end
lesse to instance in these kind of parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars:
And how Wit may be sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to the use of the Church, we have <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licate
examples</hi> in the Apologetick of
<hi>Tertullian,</hi> in the Epistle of <hi>Cyprian</hi> to
<hi>Donatus,</hi> in <hi>Minutius Felix</hi> his Octavius,
in the Orations of <hi>Gregory Nazienzen</hi>
               <pb n="38" facs="tcp:48898:27"/>
and <hi>Basil,</hi> in the Sermons of <hi>Chrysostom,
Bernard, Chrysologus,</hi> and multitudes of
others amongst the Antients. To say
nothing of the <hi>Worthies in our own Church</hi>
and of our own time, amongst whom
I cannot but mention my most Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
and most Excellent <hi>Predecessor</hi> in
this Diocesse, whose writings are like
the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> flowing with <hi>milke
and honey.</hi> Now in this particular I
should <hi>advise</hi> those who have vigorous
and <hi>predominant witts,</hi> of whom we may
say, as <hi>Quintilian</hi> said of <hi>Seneca,</hi> It is
pity they should not do as they ought,
who can do as they will, that they
would <hi>not too much indulge</hi> nor loosen
the reynes unto luxuriancy of fancy in
so solemn and serious a work as prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
the Gospel, <hi>but proportion their
ballast to their sayl;</hi> and <hi>temper</hi> their
<hi>fancy with Humility,</hi> pietie, and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
so as they may <hi>render severe and
solid truths</hi> the <hi>more amiable,</hi> and recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile
the minds of their hearers the better
unto sound and saving doctrine, as <hi>Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitians</hi>
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:48898:27"/>
convey their physick in some <hi>plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant
vchiculum</hi> to <hi>gratifie</hi> the <hi>palat,</hi> &amp; pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
the <hi>fastidium</hi> of their tender Patients.
After this manner must we preach the
Gospel, discharging faithfully towards
God and men the trust which is reposed
in us; for it is required in Stewards that
a man be <hi>found faithfull,</hi> 1 Cor. 4. 2.</p>
            <p>Now there being three <hi>wayes of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storal
Feeding,</hi> as <hi>Bernard</hi> hath observed,
<hi>Ore, Mente, Opere,</hi> by Preaching, Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and Living, it is necessary to adde
these two latter unto that which we
have already handled. 1. To be the
<hi>Lords Remembrancers,</hi> and to give our
selves continually to prayer, Acts 6. 4.
If we Consider the <hi>Great Importance</hi> of
our Ministery in dispensing the unfear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chable
Riches of Christ; the <hi>great dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty</hi>
of the work, for which without
divine assistance none can be sufficient:
the <hi>Divine efficacy</hi> and Cooperation
required unto the successe of it: the
<hi>Infinite preciousnesse</hi> of the soules of men,
and <hi>great Concernments</hi> of the Church of
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:48898:28"/>
God over which we have an inspection,
we cannot but grow unto holy <hi>Cyprians
Resolution,</hi> who thus saith of himself in
his Book <hi>De bono pudicitiae, Non solum profe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimus
verba quae de scripturarum sacris fon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tibus
veniunt, sed cum ipsis verbis preces ad

            </p>
            <p>2. We must <hi>give testimony</hi> unto our
doctrine <hi>by a Godly Example,</hi> as <hi>Paul</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth
<hi>Timotby</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> 1 Tim. 4. 12.
Tit. 2. 7. and <hi>Peter</hi> all Elders, 1 Pet. 5.
3. <hi>as John</hi> was both a <hi>shining</hi> and a <hi>Burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
Lamp, John 5. 35. The <hi>Star</hi> which
led the wise men unto Christ, the <hi>Pillar

did not onely shine, but go before
them, Matth. 2. 9. Exod. 13. 21. the
<hi>voice of Jacob</hi> will do little good if the

no person who had <hi>any blemish</hi> was to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
the Oblations of the Lord, <hi>Levit. 21

what Graces ought to be in his Ministers.
The Priest was to have in his robes <hi>Bells
and Pomgranates;</hi> the one a figure of sound
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:48898:28"/>
doctrine, and the other of a fruitfull life,
Exod. 28. 33, 34. the Lord will be <hi>san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifyed
in</hi> all those that draw near unto
him, Isa. 52. 11. for the <hi>sins of the Priests</hi>
make the people <hi>abhorr</hi> the offering of
the Lord, 1 Sam. 2. 17. their wicked <hi>lives</hi>
do <hi>shame their doctrine; Passionem Christi
annunciant profitendo, male agendo exhono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,</hi>
as S. <hi>Austine</hi> speaks, with their <hi>do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine</hi>
they <hi>build,</hi> and with their <hi>lives</hi> they
<hi>destroy.</hi> The Minister who will winne his
people, must not only <hi>doctorem virtutis
se praebere, sed ducem,</hi> as <hi>Lactantius, ut si
praecipientem sequi nolint, sequantur antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentem.</hi>
The salt which is it self unsavory,
will hardly season other things. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
this point with that <hi>wholsom passage</hi>
of <hi>Hierom</hi> ad <hi>Nepotianum,</hi> Let not, saith
he, thy works shame thy doctrine, lest
they who hear thee in the Church tacit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
answer, Why doest thou not thy self
what thou teachest others? He is too de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licate
a teacher who perswadeth others
to fast with a full belly. A Robber may
accuse Covetousness. <hi>Sacerdotis Christi os,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:48898:29"/>
mens, manusque concordent;</hi> a Minister of
Christ should have his tongue, and his
heart, and his hand agree.</p>
            <p>I shall conclude all with Two words
of Exhortation; one to my Reverend
Brethren in the Clergy, and the other to
the people.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>To my Brethren:</hi> That they would with
all their might <hi>set about this</hi> most necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
work <hi>of feeding</hi> the flock over which
the Holy Ghost hath made them Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seers,
<hi>&amp; therby testifie their love unto Christ,</hi>
who by that Love doth adjure us to feed
his sheep and lambs, <hi>John 21. 15. 16, 17. If
we would not be an Anathema Maranatha</hi>
for not loving of Christ, we must do that
which he by so strong an argument as the
Love of him doth injoyn. Is it possible
for a man to <hi>love the father,</hi> and to <hi>starve</hi>
the children? Is it possible to <hi>love the
Lord,</hi> and to neglect his <hi>doubled</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubled
command? Is it possible to love
God, and <hi>to hate our brethren?</hi> Or do we
not hate our brethren <hi>when we betray</hi>
their souls to perdition? O let us lay to
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:48898:29"/>
heart that <hi>most solemn and tremendous
charge</hi> of the Apostle, <hi>I charge thee before
God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, who shall
judge the quick and the dead at his appearing
and his kingdom, preach the word, be instant
in season, out of season, reprove, rebuke<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort,
with all long-suffering and doctrine,</hi>
2 Tim. 4. 1, 2. Let us <hi>consider the dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
Accompt</hi> which at that fiery Tribunal
of this Great Judge will be required of
us, Heb. 13. 17. <hi>the woe</hi> which we incurr
if we neglect it, 1 Cor. 9. 16. and the
<hi>horrid guilt</hi> of the blood of souls which
thereby we contract, <hi>Ezeck.</hi> 3. 17, 18, 20
their blood will I require at thy hand
Let us <hi>consider</hi> the <hi>unvaluable preciousness</hi>
of the souls committed to our charge,
of more worth then all the world be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side,
Mat. 16. 26. insomuch that Heathen
men have said, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>.
It is the property of a Reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
soul, saith <hi>Antoninus</hi> the Heathen
Emperour, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to preferre
nothing before it self. O what a doleful
thing will it be to have the everlasting
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:48898:30"/>
perdition of such precious souls to lie up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
our betraying of them! Consider the
<hi>Inestimable price</hi> wherwith they were pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased,
even the Blood of God, Acts 20
28. and how fearfull a thing it will be for
the Blood of Christ to cry out against
us for destroying those souls which that
blood did purchase. <hi>Consider</hi> the <hi>continual
Dangers</hi> these precious souls are exposed
to, the <hi>vigilancy</hi> of a <hi>cunning,</hi> a <hi>powerfull</hi>
a <hi>malicious adversary,</hi> who goeth about
seeking to devour them, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 8 the
<hi>baits, snares, examples,</hi> and <hi>entanglements</hi>
of an evil world, the <hi>swarms of Innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable</hi>
inward lusts which warr against the
soul. O how vigilant should we be to
fore warn &amp; arm them against the assault
of so great dangers? Lastly, <hi>consider</hi> we
the <hi>weight</hi> and greatnesse of <hi>that Crown of
Righteousness</hi> and glory which the Chief
Shepherd reserveth for all those who wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
and with a ready mind feed the
flock of God. They who turn many to
Righteousness <hi>shall shine as Stars</hi> for ever
and ever, 1 Pet. 5. 4. Dan. 12. 3. <hi>What
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:48898:30"/>
a Glorious Testimony</hi> will it be before the
throne of Christ at the last day, when so
many souls shall stand forth and say, <hi>This
was the hand</hi> which snatched us out of the
fire, <hi>This tongue</hi> was to us a tree of life, his
<hi>Reproofs</hi> and convictions <hi>awakened</hi> us, his
<hi>Exhortations perswaded</hi> us, his <hi>Consolations</hi>
revived us, his <hi>wisdom</hi> counsel'd us, his <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample</hi>
guided us unto this Glory! Some are
apt to charge Clergymen with ambitious
pursuance of dignities and preferments;
Behold here a <hi>preferment worthy</hi> the climb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
after, <hi>a dignity</hi> worthy to be contended
for, an <hi>holy, an Apostolical Ambition,</hi> as St.
<hi>Pauls</hi> expression importeth, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

Rom. 15. 20. which is as much as
<hi>Ambitioso conatu praedicare Evangeliu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>;</hi> prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
the Gospel where it had not before
been heard, was the <hi>Apostles</hi> greatest honor
which ambitiously he did aspi<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <hi>To the People.</hi> 1. We exhort them to
<hi>pray</hi> for their Ministers, since they have a
Service upon them which without divine
Grace none are sufficient for, that God
would by his special assistance <hi>enable them</hi>
               <pb n="46" facs="tcp:48898:31"/>
to discharge so great a trust. <hi>God commands</hi>
it, <hi>we beseech</hi> it, <hi>our weakness wants</hi> it, <hi>your
souls require</hi> it; the <hi>more</hi> you <hi>pray</hi> for your
Minister, the <hi>more</hi> you will <hi>profit</hi> by him.
You <hi>help to edifie your selves,</hi> you help him
to study and pray and preach for you,
while you pray for him.</p>
            <p>2 To <hi>take heed</hi> that the <hi>labour</hi> of your
Ministers for your souls <hi>be not</hi> by your
carelesseness <hi>all in vain.</hi> Do not with our
Sermons, which cost us so hard labour, as
<hi>David</hi> did with the <hi>water</hi> of the well of
<hi>Bethleem,</hi> spill them on the ground, and let
them cry from thence, like the blood of
<hi>Abel</hi> against you. So <hi>long</hi> as he keeps to
his Commission, and delivers the Counsel
of God, you <hi>cannot despise</hi> the <hi>work of your
Minister,</hi> but you do therewithall <hi>despise
the blood</hi> of your Saviour. If your souls be
<hi>dear</hi> in their eyes, should they be <hi>vile</hi> in
your <hi>own?</hi> Will you by your wickedness
<hi>turn the prayers</hi> of your Pastors into <hi>curses,</hi>
their <hi>Sermons</hi> into a favour of death, and
their <hi>tears</hi> into the <hi>blood</hi> of your own souls?
Shall they <hi>begg mercy</hi> for you, and will <hi>you
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:48898:31"/>
reject</hi> it? Shall they <hi>tender Grace</hi> unto you,
and will <hi>you resist</hi> it? Shall <hi>they open</hi> for you
the door of Life, &amp; will you shut it against
your selves? Shall <hi>Christ by them beseech</hi>
you, and will you by your Impenitency
<hi>refuse</hi> him? Is it not a Reasonable Request,
though you will not love your Ministers,
yet not to Hate nor destroy your selves?
Must he Teach, and you not Learn? Must
he open <hi>his lips,</hi> and you <hi>shut your ears?</hi> are
<hi>Sermons preached</hi> to be praised onely, and
not obeyed? Must he <hi>Reprove Sin</hi> in you,
and will <hi>you Reprove God</hi> in him? Shall he
take up the <hi>weapons of God</hi> to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
sinne, and will you take up
the <hi>weapons of lust</hi> to withstand God!
<hi>Is it good to kick</hi> against the pricks?
<hi>Will Gods word be impunè despised?</hi> Can his
Law be put to flight? where it doth not
perswade, <hi>can it not curse?</hi> Do we provoke
the Lord to jealousie? are we stronger then
he? Shall the Minister in the name of
God, <hi>forewarn us</hi> of the wrath to come,
and shall we <hi>belye the Lord,</hi> and say It is
not he? <hi>Shall we blesse</hi> where God curs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth?
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:48898:32"/>
and <hi>promise peace,</hi> where God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clameth
warre? Shall we <hi>sell our selves</hi> to
sin, and <hi>make a Covenant</hi> with Hell and
death, as if we could sin securely, and
choose whither we would perish or no?
Will not the Lord make us know at the
last whose word shall stand, His or Ours?
O that the <hi>Love of</hi> Christ might <hi>constrain</hi>
us, and his <hi>Goodness lead</hi> us unto Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
that when Christ doth <hi>beseech us,</hi>
we would be perswaded <hi>not to deny</hi> him!
Did <hi>Satan</hi> dye for us? Did the <hi>world</hi> or the
<hi>flesh</hi> ever <hi>redeem us?</hi> were they <hi>scourged,</hi> or
<hi>mocked,</hi> or <hi>crucified</hi> to save us? O that
Christ should be perswaded to dye for us,
and we should give him his blood back a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
and choose rather to dye our selves!
Consider what I say, and the Lord give
you understanding in all things.</p>
