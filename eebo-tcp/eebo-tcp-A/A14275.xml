            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE READER</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He reasons be manifold (good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der) that mooued me to publish thys present Tale. First, that I might (in what I was able) illustrate or make better known to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world, my countrie or place of byrth: to which (as <hi>Cicero</hi> saith) each man doth ow the third part of his life, &amp; for which ther is no good man, but wil ieopard his life, aduenture his safetie, and hazard the dearest things hee dooth possesse: neither yet was there euer any man so brutish, but reioyceth to heare his countrie commended, and is deligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted when he heareth the same wel spoken off and praised: such is the affection that euery man beareth to it: that <hi>Ouid</hi> expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the same, said, he coulde not tel howe it came to passe, nor whence it should proceede. His words be these:
<q>
                  <l>Nescio qua natale solum dulcedine cunctos</l>
                  <l>Ducit, nec</l>
               </q>
Hence it came to passe that antiquity gaue diuine honor to such as had deserued wel of their countrie: either in peace, by inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting something to the profit or wealth thereof: or in war, by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentring their bodies in defence thereof.</p>
            <p>Another reason was, that albeit neither my writing, nor other indeuour whatsoeuer, be able to perfourm any thing that might either beautifie or adorne the places I speake of: Yet hereby I would animate, or encourage those worthy Poets, who haue writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
               <hi>Epithalamion Thamesis,</hi> to publish the same: I haue seen it in Latene verse (in my iudgment) wel done, but the Author I know not for what reason doth suppresse it: That which is written in English, though long since it was promised, yet is it not perfourmed: so as it seemeth, some vnhappy Star enuieth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sight of so good a work: which once set abroad, such trifles as these would vanish, and be ouershadowed, much like the Moon and other starres, which after the appearing of the Sunne are not to be seene at all.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, being fully resolued to leaue my country, I held best before my departure <hi>Cigneum aliquid canere:</hi> not vnlike the
<pb facs="tcp:11815:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Swans, who before their death do sing as <hi>Ouid, Uirgil, Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial, Horace</hi> with all the poets do constantly affyrme. The Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers say, it is because of the spirit labouring to passe tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row the long and small passage of her necke, makes a noise as if she did sing. <hi>Pithagoras</hi> did thinke their soules were immortal, and saith, how before their death, they reioice and sing as going to a better life. The maner of their singing M. <hi>Thomas Watson</hi> in his <hi>Odes</hi> expresseth thus:
<q>
                  <l>Qualis vbi longo moerore Castrius ales confectus senio graui. &amp;c.</l>
               </q>
Which verses <hi>A. F.</hi> hath englished on this wise.</p>
            <q>
               <l>Like to the siluer Swan, who seeing death to be comming,</l>
               <l>Wandreth alone for a while through streams of louely Caister:</l>
               <l>Then to the flowring bankes all faint at last he repairth,</l>
               <l>Singing there sweet bird, his dieng song to Caister:</l>
               <l>Geuing there sweete bird, his last farewell to Caister:</l>
               <l>Yeelding vp, sweet bird, his breath and song to Caister.</l>
            </q>
            <p>The last, and not the least motiue was my friendes request, whose importunate demaund without breach of amitie, I could not gainsay: to whom, as also to thy fauourable construction (curtcous and friendly reader) I commit the same.</p>

When Winter was past, a great part of the Citizens of Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, with those that inhabited neere thereaboutes traueiled thether, and by force minded to breake downe the Fort or mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition which they had there buylded. But the Danes stoutlye resisted them, and not far from the place gaue them a sharpe battaile, where the Christians were put to flight, and foure of King <hi>Alfreds</hi> men were slaine.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:11815:12" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Thus the pagane or heathen Danes remained Lordes or maisters of those quarters, compelling the husbandmen to eare and till the ground, meaning themselues to reape the commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie of it. But the good King <hi>Alfred,</hi> who alwaies was care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for the welfare of his subiectes, gathered an armie, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore haruest time pitched his tents neer to the place of their a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bode. By whose comming, the enemies were so affraid, that they durst not once peepe out of their hold to fetch either cattell or corne out of the fields by force. In this space, it happened on a time, as the King rode alongst by the riuer side, he viewed the water, and perceiued how that in some places of it, the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell might easily bee stopped, and the streame made lesse. Whereupon he (as <hi>Huntington</hi> writeth) caused it to bee cut in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to three seuerall braunches or armes: but howsoeuer it was, hee so weakened the streame, that the Danes could not bring back their ships the same way they came. Which thing the Danes perceiuing, and knowing well it was in vaine for them to abide any longer there, they left their Shippes, and fled by land as fast as they could to <hi>Quatbridge,</hi> sending their wiues and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren againe into east England. After this the king departed, and the Londoners and Countrimen seeing the Danes were gone, burst downe their Holde<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>, and got some of their ships backe againe to <hi>London,</hi> and the rest they burned and brake all to peeces.</p>
               <p>But here peraduenture you will aske me, howe I shoulde come by the knowledge of these thinges, beeing done so many hundred yeares agoe. To this I answere, that in things that were done long before any man that is now liuing can remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, wee must credit that our Fathers haue committed to wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting concerning the same. And in my opinion, the neerer the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porter liueth to those times in which the thinges he speaketh or writeth of were done, the more credite is to bee geuen to him.</p>
               <p>And as concerning this matter, it is confirmed by the reporte of a verie auncient, reuerent and and learned Wry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, namely <hi>Asserus Meneuensis,</hi> Bishop of Saint <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uies,</hi> that liued in the verie selfe same time when these thinges
<pb facs="tcp:11815:12" rendition="simple:additions"/>
were done, and <hi>Maryanus Scotus</hi> who liued and wrote a chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicle at least 500. yeares ago, as <hi>Florentinus</hi> a Monk of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cester, who continued it, doth witnesse and declare. Besides di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers others of great antiquitie and credite as <hi>Henry</hi> of <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tington, Mathew</hi> of <hi>Westminster,</hi> and manie moe, who d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>e all confirme that which is before declared. Besides there remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth yet the ruines of an old Castle or Fort betweene <hi>Hartford</hi> Castle and the Mill, which I doe vndoubtedly beleeue was the verie selfe same Fort that the <hi>Danes</hi> builded.</p>

All which thinges considered, together with the parting of the streame before remembred, me thinkes should be sufficient to confirme your minde, and cause you to beleeue that there haue bene ships at <hi>Ware</hi> and <hi>Hartford.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hereunto may bee added that it was a common vse of the <hi>Danes</hi> to row or drawe vp their ships into some smaller creeke or riuer where that they might ride all winter with least dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. And time worketh some alteration both by water and by land, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> where great riuers did somtimes run, nowe it is vtterlie drie, and in stead of maine waters we haue goodly &amp; florishing Meades.
