            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

or an elective ſucceſsion:
If an hereditary ſucceſsion, then hereditary
from the Conqueſt; if ſo, then by the ſword
have we freed our ſelves from ſlavery, as we
we were by the ſword inſlaved; if electory,
then the Electors may reclaim their own
power, and call the elected to an account,
his authority ariſing from the Electors.</p>
            <p>At the death of Kings, all the Officers of
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:117468:3"/>
his Court lay their offices at the dead Kings
feet. This ceremony doth declare, That all
offices and truſts dye with him, and then (if
not in a Parliament time) the Biſhops, Dukes,
Earls, Barons, Chief Juſtices, and Judges, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim
the next Heir to the dead King, King;
which ceremony doth manifeſt, that they are
electory, and not hereditary: For the Biſhops,
Dukes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are the Body of the Kingdom,
and Councel of the people, and their Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentative
out of Parliament, truſted by the
King for the peoples weal; and if electory,
why ſhall not the people elect whom they
pleaſe? and when the truſt is abuſed, which
the elected is truſted with, why ſhall not the
people call the elected to an account of his
truſt, and puniſh him according to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Law (which is Reaſon) for breach of
truſt, if he refuſe to yield an account of his
truſt?</p>
            <p>It hath been <hi>Englands,</hi> and other Kingdoms
Cuſtom, to call to higheſt Offices, ſuch as
were of greateſt fame, repute, quality, and
eſtates, thereby imagining, that they who are
conceived moſt honorable, and moſt rich; are
beſt bred in knowledg, and would duly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:117468:3"/>
their truſts, for conſcience and honors
ſake, and to preſerve their eſtates, being lyable
to reſtitution for wrong doing.</p>
            <p>The truſt that Kings of <hi>England</hi> are truſted
with, is, to govern well, and therefore hath
the name of <hi>Rex,</hi> being a derivative name or
word, from <hi>Rego,</hi> to Govern; which word,
if obſerved well, will tell you what <hi>Rex,</hi> a
King, is; for it is an old Proverb, <hi>Regum eſt
parcere ſubjectis, &amp; debulare ſuperbos; Regum eſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
id eſt, officium Regum,</hi> the office and duty of
Kings.</p>
            <p>The King enjoyes the Crown, not as his,
but the Kingdoms, nor can grant any office
before he is ſworn; and when he is ſworn,
it is by the peoples Repreſentative, truſted for
that office, by the dead King, in his life time;
and the Crown Lands, after he is ſworn, and
crowned, allotted him for maintenance, as a
reward to maintain him, to execute his office.</p>
            <p>After he is ſworn to execute ſuch truſts as
the people have truſted him with, he is by
the hands of the Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi>
(the chief Eccleſiaſtical Miniſter in <hi>England,</hi>
clothed in white) crowned with a Golden
Crown, beſet with Diamonds, and other rich
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:117468:4"/>
Jewels, which carry a luſtre round about the
Crown and Head; which is a Celeſtial Type,
fit for ſuch a man, as a glorious renown, that
will diſcharge that great truſt he is truſted
with, and hath ſworn to execute it.</p>
            <p>By vertue of his oath, he is Chief Juſtice
of <hi>England,</hi> to adminiſter true Juſtice, as well
to poor as to rich, without reſpect of perſons;
and hath thereby power to call to his aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
Wiſemen, and Lawyers, and to depute
them, ſwear them, and locate them at his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure;
and if they do not well demean them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
to diſplace them, and call others.</p>
            <p>He is alſo Lord Chancellor, and maketh
a Seal (which is Treaſon to counterfeit, for
fear of wrong to be done by it to his truſt,
which he is truſted with) and is to hear and
determine in equity, what Reaſon, which is
Common Law, may impoſe upon any man
contrary to equity.</p>
            <p>He is Receiver of the Revenue of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
being truſted in his hands for mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
of Officers deputed by him in Courts
of Juſtice for his aſsiſtance, in executing true
Juſtice.</p>
            <p>He is Admiral of the Sea, and the Ton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:117468:4"/>
and Poundage the Kingdoms, truſted
in his hands for maintenance of a Navy, to
protect the Merchants from Pirates and Sea
Rovers.</p>
            <p>He is Conſtable of all the Towers, Caſtles,
Forts, and Arms in the Kingdom, being the
<hi>Militia,</hi> which is <hi>moenia Angliae,</hi> truſted in his
hands by the people, and by them bought to
preſerve the Kingdom againſt forraign Inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
and domeſtick Rebellions.</p>
            <p>He is Gaurdian of many Infants, until they
come to the age of twenty one yeers, left by
their Parents hereditary eſtates; and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
the Orphant and eſtate, and to breed
them in the fear of God, and learning, and to
account when they come to age.</p>
            <p>He is Keeper and Preſerver of the Peace of
the Kingdom, and to ſee the Statute Laws
put in execution; and to have a care, that if
any ſhall offend againſt it, to fine and puniſh
him at his pleaſure, or at the pleaſure of ſuch
Judges or Juſtices as he ſhall depute.</p>
            <p>Many more Truſts have the people repoſed
in him, which for brevity, I omit, and he
hath broken them; he hath turned the <hi>Militia</hi>
into the peoples bowels, and killed them
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:117468:5"/>
with it; he hath taken the Merchants, with
the Tonnage and Poundage, and ſpoyled
their Ships, and Goods at Sea. Equity hath
he turned into cruel iniquity, contrary to a
good Conſcience; he hath ſold Juſtice, and
placed Ignorance in her Seat; he hath ſold
the peoples Intereſt to monopolizing Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures;
he hath thrown wiſdom and honeſty
into priſon, protected the wicked, and
puniſhed the innocent; he claimeth the <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litia,</hi>
the Revenue, the Tonnage and Pound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age,
the Crown, and Crown Lands, to be his,
and not the peoples; and refuſeth to account
to the people, being demanded ſeveral times,
and ſaith he will account to none but God,
and will not by fair means, nor legal tryal,
give any anſwer; and therefore, according to
<hi>Englands</hi> Laws <hi>hath</hi> his ſentence, as conſeſsing
all that is charged upon him, in reſpect he
denyeth it not.</p>
            <p>Now let all the world judg, whether the
people have juſtly recalled their own Intereſt,
and adjudged him to death for ſuch abuſes,
and refuſing to account.</p>
