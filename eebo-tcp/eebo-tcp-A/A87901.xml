            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The RESOLVE of the CITIE.</head>
            <p>OVr Reſpects to <hi>Peace,</hi> and <hi>Order,</hi> are too notorious to be queſtioned, ſince by the meer Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of <hi>Charity</hi> and <hi>Obedience,</hi> we have thus long ſuſpended the <hi>Juſtice</hi> we owe to our <hi>Selves,</hi> together with that <hi>Vengeance,</hi> which the <hi>Blood</hi> of our Murthered Companions re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires at our hands. Nor hath the Power of theſe Principles of Publique tenderneſſe been leſſe Eminent, upon our <hi>Judgements,</hi> than upon our <hi>Paſſions;</hi> For, We have as well <hi>Believed,</hi> in <hi>Contradiction</hi> to Evidence of <hi>Experiment,</hi> as we have <hi>Suffered,</hi> in <hi>Oppoſition</hi> to the very Elements, and Dictates of <hi>Humanity. Witneſſe that Execrable Munday</hi> (ſacred to the Eternal Infamy of this City) even <hi>Then;</hi> When we had that Enemy at our <hi>Mercy,</hi> toward whom, by the Rights of Nature, and of Generoſity, we were not bound to exerciſe <hi>any;</hi> even then, I ſay, in the very <hi>Heat,</hi> and <hi>Courſe</hi> of an Honeſt, and Powerfull <hi>Indignation,</hi> we returned <hi>Quietly,</hi> to our Houſes, upon the firſt Notice, that the <hi>Authority</hi> of the <hi>City</hi> would have it ſo. But it is likewiſe true, that this Aſſurance, was added to the Meſſage, <hi>viz. That the Common Council, was Senſible of our Grievances, and would duly Conſider them.</hi> Since this, we find nothing done in Purſuance of that Promiſe; but on the Contrary, Iniuries are Multiplyed upon us; and thoſe of that Day, ſerve but as Arguments of Encouragement to Greater. <hi>Some</hi> of us <hi>Killed, Others Wounded,</hi> and <hi>lead in Triumph Naked</hi> through the Strets: Two or Three Hundred Thouſand Perſons <hi>Looking on, to Celebrate the Conqueſt, and the Shame.</hi> A Citizens Skull, is but a thing to try the Temper of a Souldiers Sword upon; Give us but every man a <hi>Red-Coat</hi> for a <hi>Caſh Keeper,</hi> and the work's done. They're come within a Trifle on't already; and all this while, an <hi>Order</hi> to be <hi>Quiet,</hi> is all our Patient Maſters would afford us. Give us an Order that may make us <hi>Safe</hi> (although we need not <hi>Ask,</hi> what we can give our ſelves) <hi>Perſwade</hi> theſe peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to be <hi>Gone,</hi> or <hi>Bid us</hi> Drive them out; What <hi>Law</hi> made <hi>Pauls,</hi> and <hi>Greſham Colledge, Garriſons?</hi> If nothing elſe will do, wee'l do't our ſelves: We have <hi>Engaged,</hi> and <hi>Sworn</hi> the <hi>Vindication of the City,</hi> and nothing can <hi>Abſolve</hi> us from the <hi>Oath</hi> we have taken This muſt be done betimes too, 'twill come too late elſe, to prevent, either the Neceſſity of a Tumult, or the greater Miſchief, of a Supine, and Credulous ſecurity. <hi>A Parliament</hi> in <hi>January,</hi> will do us no more good, than a Cordial will do him that was <hi>Hanged</hi> laſt Seſſions. Our Senſe at Large, we delivered to the world, in a Paper, En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuled, <hi>The Final Proteſt, and Senſe of the CITY:</hi> Which is Publique enough, notwithſtanding the great Deſign uſed to ſuppreſſe it, and the Inſolences of diverſe Perſons, diſaffected to the good of the City, toward thoſe that ſold them. <hi>To that we adhere,</hi> That <hi>Proteſt</hi> of <hi>Ours,</hi> produced <hi>Another</hi> from the <hi>Common Council,</hi> of the 20th. Current, to which ſomething ought to be ſaid, (by the way, let the Reader take Notice of an Error in the Printing, and, for—<hi>Not Soon</hi> Vote up the City, &amp;e. Read, <hi>Soon</hi> Vote up, &amp;c.—) The ſum of that Order is, but in effect, the Iuſtification of the Lord Mayor, in the matter of Prudence and Integrity: we do not Deny, but finding our ſelves aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned to all ſorts of Outrages, by the Cold Proceedings of the Court, in our behalf, We were tranſported to ſome bitter Reflections: Involving the <hi>preſent Mayor,</hi> with his more Criminal <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſor, Ireton,</hi> in the Imputation. We ſhall not more <hi>Gladly find</hi> it a Miſtake, than <hi>Readily Confeſs</hi> it one, when we reap the Effects of that Care for the Good of the City; but ſo long as <hi>we</hi> are <hi>tyed</hi> up from all <hi>Lawful Defence,</hi> and the <hi>Publique Enemy</hi> at <hi>liberty</hi> to Practiſe all <hi>Unlawful Violences</hi> upon us, We deſire to be Pardoned, if we ſuſpend in the Caſe. The Cloze indeed is very Noble, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of the Court, where they Declare; <hi>For the Fundamental Lawes, and the Proteſtant Religion, &amp;c.—and in fine, to endeavour the Convening of a Free Parliament,</hi> in order thereunto. But in Contradiction to this Reſolve, the Committee of Officers have yeſterday publiſhed a Paper, Entituled, <hi>The Agreement, &amp;c.</hi>——fairly telling us, That we are to be Governed by People of their Chuſing, &amp; by a Model of their framing, without any regard had to the <hi>Practice,</hi> and <hi>Reaſon</hi> of the <hi>Antient Laws,</hi> or to the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt,</hi> and <hi>Liberty</hi> of every Freeborn <hi>Engliſhman.</hi> This Vſurpation is to be conſidered in its due Place; at preſent it concerns us, to hinder them from making the Slavery of the City, their firſt Step towards the Subjection of the Nation. The ſeaſonable Care of This, we do Humbly, and Ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly recommend to the <hi>Court of Common Council;</hi> Our Hopes are, that we are now fallen into Bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter hands, and if our Magiſtrates will but Command us, they have an Hundred Thouſand Lives in Readineſs to Engage for them. If wee ſhould be ſo unhappy, as to be ſtill delayed; wee doe however waſh our hands of the Conſequences: And ſo <hi>God Direct and Deliver Us.</hi>
