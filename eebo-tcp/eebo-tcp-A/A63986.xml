            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>Twelve Hundred thouſand Pounds being Voted to make good the Deficiency of the late Currant Coyn of this Kingdom, 'tis to be underſtood and taken for Granted,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THAT all ſuch Money now in, and to be henceforward received at the <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chequer,</hi> muſt be by Tale reckoned as Standard-money of <hi>England,</hi> and in ſuch to be iſſued thence. And</p>
            <p>Foraſmuch as the Time by the Proclamation given for the Currency of the Clipt Money is ſo ſhort, and the Opportunities for parting with it, that are hitherto given, being only by Taxes and Lones, it may well be imagined that great part of ſuch Money (notwithſtanding the 1200000 <hi>l.</hi> as aforeſaid, voted to ſupply the Deficiency) will remain in the Hands of many poſſeſt of it when the Currancy ends, to their Damage, great Diſſatisfaction and Loſs; For leſſening which Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies as far as the Matter will bear, 'tis humbly Propos'd,</p>
            <p>That as well for the Raiſing one Million of ready Money for the preſent Uſe of the War, as to give Opportunity to thoſe poſſeſt of Clipt Money to part with the ſame to content;</p>
            <p>That 225000 <hi>l.</hi> yearly (which two Thirds of the Additional Duties this next year expiring may furniſh) be ſetled for five years for the Payment of Forty ſhillings yearly for ſuch five years, to ſuch as in Hammered Money ſhall pay in nine pounds, for the Receipt of which, in a time to be limited, a Receiver may be appointed in each Shire-Town in <hi>England,</hi> and to every Perſon ſo paying nine pounds, may at the ſame time be provided to give out five Bills, entituling the Bearer to Forty ſhillings for each of the five years, on which Bills it ſhould like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe be printed, what each Bill on a Rebate of 5 <hi>per Cent.</hi> is every year worth rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Money, which without any Compulſion would give them ſuch Currancy they would in all Payments be preferred before Money it ſelf; and as a further Conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience it may be ſo contrived, as that the truth of them may not only be tried here in <hi>London,</hi> but in other great Towns, and muſt be particularly ſo to be in the Shire-Towns where firſt given out; and as yet a farther Convenience in this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance, There being a Tax upon Houſes voted, which being to be Received in the Country, may be yearly paid in thoſe Forty ſhilling Tickets, and ſo keep the Money there, which will be the ſame thing to the Crown, and give Satisfaction to the People by ſo having their Security at home, and leave the beſt third of the additional Duties to raiſe more Money, beſides the Million aforeſaid.</p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>Now for taking in the reſt of the Hammer'd Money.</head>
               <p>A Receiver may be alſo appointed in every Shire-Town, provided to give out ſuch like Bills (but each of 5 <hi>l.</hi>) as aforeſaid, for every 5 <hi>l.</hi> brought to him, enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleing the Bearer to 5 <hi>l.</hi> at the <hi>Exchequer</hi> at any time in the Year 1697 and to be at any time taken for any Tax by the King in the mean time; and may be as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid ſo contrived, as not only to be tried here in <hi>London</hi> and other great Towns, but particularly in the Shire-Town where the ſame were firſt given out, and ſo can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be Counterfeit, if brought there only to be tried.</p>
               <p>And therefore will in a great meaſure ſupply the want of coined Money, till coin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, be a certain Security to thoſe that part with their Money, that they ſhall have it again in New Money, the Old and the 1200000 <hi>l.</hi> given being to be appropria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for it; and the Receiving theſe Bills in the mean time for Taxes by the King, will be no Inconvenience, for there will be always ſufficient in Bullion brought in, as aforeſaid, to make them ready Money, it being in ſuch Caſe to be Enacted, That for as many of ſuch Bills as ſhall be taken for Taxes, the Money appropriated for the paying ſuch Bills in the Year 1697. may immediately be uſed by the Crown.</p>
