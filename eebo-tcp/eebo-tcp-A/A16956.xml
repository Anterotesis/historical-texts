            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To the right honorable the LL. of the Quene of Englandes moſt honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble privy councell.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>N epistle of an Ebrew most plentifully Lerned in all Rabbin skill, (right honorable) came vnto myne handes a feuv dayes agoe: after that it had bene in England, and ſene of your grace, my L. archb. and ſome others of your Lordshippes. The right vſage of the matter conteyned therin, as the ambaſsadours letters vuill shew you, what he iudgeth, may turne to the good of all Christendome. The matter being of ſo weighty im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, it toucheth her maiesty, to take care, how to dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le in princely Lerned wiſdome, throughly for this caſe: that all Christendome may ſee as much done for the comon good, as the care and skill off man can afforde. Your hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ures shall ſee in the letter two poinctes of request: the one touching the countenance and Charges of the Quene to ſend a ſcholer requeſted, to rule all the ſcholes of diuinity in Constantinople. This argueth ſome conference with the emperour for leaue And he should be first of high aucto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity at home, that should do this abroad, to the Quenes ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour. The other poinct of request standeth, for performan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce, vpon a ſcholers Lerning: all Ebrew skill for the ton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue, &amp; maſsorites, for comparing with clear declaration, the prophetes and apostles: and for awnſwear to all the groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des &amp; branches of the Iewes cabala, &amp; traditiones, how it fayleth: and what in theyr studies can be allowed. Here a Lerned awnſwearer will vndertake by ſure grammer and reaſon to ſuch a plain hart as he beareth, to make Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, the prophetes, the Goſpel and epistles to be as harpers fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the Lambe on mount Sion: and will proue all places of Scripture for this concent from the purest and best Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bines, taught from ancienter writers then are of theyr apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaſy:
<pb facs="tcp:18855:3"/>
and will shew touching all theyr fables, trough theyr Bi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ble, how for memory of phraſes or ſtories they were invented: as that: Abakuk brought Daniel a meſse of Pottage. wheras the ſentence written in great letters THE IVST SHAL LIVE BY FAITH, this for two poinctes: Iuſtice chalenged of Daniel to haue ſtopped the Liones mouth: and fayth, told by the king of him, made the ſaing of the amiable prophet to be the meſse of potage to him that allways maketh God the iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge. The demaund of the conſtantinopolitane Rabbin Lap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth in it a diſcourſe and declaration for all theſe poinctes: in any of which he that fayleth shall be are ſmall ſway with Iewes who will require to mete with better Lerned then them ſelues before they change religion. Hither of ordinary courſe, will be long a Cenſure of the Greke Septuagint: what they alterd to avoyd diſgrace from heathen: where they miſsed of vnskil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes, or vnhedineſs: where the Characters deceaued theyr eiſight, that a peece of a letter made a new Greke terme: how Bibles vnwowelled cauſed them ſometme of purpoſe to put one word for an other, oftener of errour: how in ſome of all theſe poinctes the hoy ghoſt that cannot miſse, maks the Apoſtles to beare with the worldes weakenes: requiring he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rein as much ebrew ksill against Grekes, as Ebrewes call for, againſt them ſelues. wherin yf Grekes be not overmatched, whoſe erroures haue marred all religion, they most hinder all the good that should come to Christianity. Theſe be two chief poinctes of the letter: which doe require a directe awnſwear: and wherupon ſtandeth all the hope of doing good, to the east part: that they Lerning religion from vs in the endes of the earth, may bend all theyr force, to recompence vs, with all good. And theſe poinctes were conteyned, in the end of the proſe, in his letter: Certen verſes of à ſonnet are the last end of an harty affection, shewing an infinite deſire to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue the trueth of Saluation opened from England, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, as he is perſuaded that may beſt be afforded. To win ſoules good,
<pb facs="tcp:18855:3"/>
which he ſo greatly deſireth, not to win a ſacrifice, or a cow, as Homer ſpeaketh, nor yet running, as Achilles, for the life of Hector, but running for the ſoules off all the wandrnig Iewes, that they may be gathered into the shepefold of Christ. He greatly extolleth <hi>the knowledge of diuinty in England, a congregation of vnderſtanding, &amp; of all variety of wiſdome, where Children are aboue all hope multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, that with aſtonishment it may be ſayd from Eſay, who hath begothen theſe to me Herein he breaketh out into reioycing that from the endes of the earth ſonges are hard, tzeby le tzaddik, the iuſt hath ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.</hi> In this, the plain dealing hart greatly reioyced, with a ſtyle lerned, from ſcriptures holy termes, not of ſo familiar te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour in the vulgar phraſe of nationes. But in ſage estimation his ſpeches wilbe perles afore any but hogges. After this entra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce to allure recompence for his most humble good will, which any wilbe willing to recompence, that know by theyr owne feel<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing what hope of ſalvation is, he entreth in political ſort to Shew the groundes of his petition, vpon what hope of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſse he opened his deſire in this Zealous maner, &amp; thirsty care, to drink of the waters of life, &amp; sheweth that M. Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward (as he writeth him) Barton, gaue him all his hope: from whoſe mouth he was stirred vp. Him he termeth in most ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable termes, Atzir, that is meſsinger, faithfull to them that ſend him: the mediatour of peace, the Lord &amp; Tiphſar. By that terme Nahum nameth the high officers of Nineveh. The ſame conſonantes make Satrap, the Lieutenantes of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſias title. Of him he ſayth, that he aſſured him how for bright<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> clearnes in the Scriptures he should be fully ſatisfied for any queſtion touching Scripture, of <hi>the Trinity or the other noble treaſures of wiſdome the</hi> armes of the world. And vpon his wordes he concludeth, that the gate of English Scho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lers being Such, the hart muſt be more eſte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ed. He hath further prayſe of the Ambaſſadours worthines: &amp; slideth thence vn
<pb facs="tcp:18855:4"/>
to the Quenes maieſties comme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dation. for which her highnes, as a defendour of the faith, in his expectation, will afford him confort &amp; help, for the good of ſtrengthening in Christianity, both him &amp; all of his deſire. Of her highnes he ſpeaketh Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quentely in Ebrew termes, picked as Iewels from the brauery of ancient ſtates: yet not baſe in our language thus: <hi>Is not ſhe the mighty amonge the nationes: à princeſſ amon<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ge the countreyes, the only quene of this world: Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>betah, the perfect amonge the perfect, the terrible as ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pes. It is knowen in the gates of the nationes, when they ſee her, that ſhe is the princeſſe, the crowne, the honour, the diademe</hi> the overruler of the knigdome of the Romanes. <hi>Eſaw or Edom the Rabbines generally in theyr commentaries put for Rome.</hi> And that she hath in her kingdom <hi>the ſkilfull in all knowledge, for the ſiluer and gold of it: as in the golden Candelſtick, for the vſe of it: the generalles, the particulares, the knoppes, the bowles, and the floures, And he pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth hartely that the Eternal king wold ſtrength her kingdome, with mighty influe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce as was vpon ſyr Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cys Draco, a roaring lion againſt the ſauage beare that shaketh the earth, &amp; quakech the nationes.</hi> Other matters which greatly touch the Quenes honour, &amp; your G. my Lord Arch. to regard, are in the epistle: for which lam not of place to giue any intelligence to her ſacred maieſty, nor direction. Your grace in a matter of this great weight, as her highnes honours regard should be, will not neglect to ſend a meſsinger to Baſil, to haue a copy of the Epistle. As for the letter, I hope it is my right, and that I may kepe it for a Iewell, as M. Beza doth his Moſes of manifold languages in Ebrew character: which were in England, but required ho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>me: of which he wrote to me to Baſil, that he wold lend me them to further the translation of the Bible, with entreating me not to leaue, or geue ouer, for no croſsing of hinderance:
<pb facs="tcp:18855:4"/>
But he will not let them goe, out of this countrey. So your g. shall haue with all my most humble duty, a copy of this epiſtle, for the Q. honour and ſpeches touching her: but M. Bezaes Book of two volumes is not a dearer <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> (ſo he wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth) to him, then this epistle is to me. And I wold not willin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gly haue it out of myne ownek eping. Touching the awnſwea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>re vnto the Lerned Rabbi, which should be in his owne ton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue, and as eloquent as his owne ſtyle, and from London whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he endorced his epistle: the Ambaſſadour at Byzantium his lettre to M. Stapers tellinge that this may turne to the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>od of all Christendome, hath I hope kindled in your zealous wiſdome, a through care: that no contempt of furtherance in this cauſe, make the nationes about think the occaſion of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred vnto you, and neglected, to haue bene the extreme hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derance &amp; blemish of Chriſtian hope for bettering through the world. Therfore modeſty forbiddeth me to chalenge any ſupertority of zeale, as once to turne my penne to exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and stirring vp. And this I write not of myne owne de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire: but to ſatisfie ſuch as wold otherwiſe think, that I should, awnſwear the Iew: becauſe he writeth vnto me. But as the Lady of Perſia kneled to Hephestio, meaning a ſupplication to Alexander: So the Iew reverencing me, looketh for an awnſwear which the whole state will allow. Now, nether modesty, nor policy ſuffreth to warre in this combat, wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thout the Q. coutenance, preferment, &amp; allowance Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras the Iew inviteth into triall of lerning: yf the Q. will, all Christendome shall iudge, whether wilbe found the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier in the prophetes language: &amp; controlment of Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bines. Doubtles, he muſt be awnſweared. When others refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe I am ready, after due recompence, to write, and to goe: Lea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uing, as Aristides, particular inuries, for the generall good.</p>
