         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb n="3" facs="tcp:111271:3"/>
(with eaſe) collected from the many Texts of
Scripture to this purpoſe theſe following few:
<bibl>Prov. 17. 26.</bibl>
               <q>To puniſh the juſt is not good, nor to
ſtrike Princes for equity.</q>
               <bibl>Chap. 40. 31.</bibl>
               <q>Againſt a King there is no riſing up.</q>
               <bibl>Ver. 32.</bibl>
               <q>If thou haſt done fooliſhly in lifting up thy
ſelfe, lay thy hands on thy mouth.</q>
               <bibl>Chap. 20. 2.</bibl>
               <q>The feare of a King is as the roring of a
Lion: who ſo provoketh him to anger, ſinneth againſt
his owne ſoule.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Fellow ſouldiers, in this point you ſee there is
no preparing for battaile, in reſpect it is unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous;
and you can receive no conqueſt but miſery
and deſtruction, as well of ſoule as of body, if you
dare beleeve that eternall God that made you,
who ſayes thus in the Pſalms of <hi>David:</hi>
               <bibl>Pſal. 45. 5.</bibl>
               <q>Thy arrows are ſharp in the heart of the
Kings enemies; whereby the people fall under thee.</q>
               <bibl>Pſal. 89. 23.</bibl>
               <q>I will beat downe his foes before his face,
and plague them that hate him.</q>
               <bibl>Pſal. 132. 18.</bibl>
               <q>His enemies will I cloathe with ſhame,
but upon himſelfe ſhall his crowne flouriſh.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This is legible in the Bible, and (beleeve it)
fellow-ſouldiers, our ſureſt way of fighting is by
the Booke; it is not onely ſtore of coyne, high
ſpirited horſe, good Ammunition, ſound skill,
fierce reſolution, nor a ſtrong Arme, but a ſtrong
Cauſe that makes a compleat ſouldier. There are
three generall Poſtures belonging to the Musket:
<hi>Make ready, Preſent,</hi> and <hi>Give fire,</hi> which ought

               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:111271:5"/>
to be joyned with theſe moſt neceſſary conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations:</p>
            <p>Ere you <hi>Make ready,</hi> remember your Cauſe;
when you <hi>Preſent,</hi> be not bloud-thirſty; and when
you <hi>Give fire,</hi> conſider againſt whom. The field is
a ſouldiers death-bed; and when he ſtands ſtou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
in expectation of a ful victory, he is but draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on: were it not moſt expedient then that his
laſt actions ſhould be his beſt? Every fellow is
not a ſouldier that ſtruts, looks big, ſwears much,
weares a broad blade, and takes Tobacco; a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
ſouldier is a perfect man, and ſhews moſt glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
in his civill valour: and ſuch a one can kill
without cruelty, and gaine a conqueſt without ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannie:
He holds it more victory to take one man
priſoner, then put ten to the ſword: You ſhall
heare him ſay, that none but cowards feare to ſee
their foes living. A valiant man in the expreſſion
of a battaile makes no noyſe, but diſcourſeth it
with civill ſorrow; and when he comes to declare
the conflict, (though of his enemies) he doth not
glory in their confuſion, but ſayes, It is pity there
ſhould be ſo much bloud ſhed. You are ſafer in
his armes, then at his ſwords point. If you be his
enemie, the onely meanes to protect your ſelfe
is to weare no weapon, and that is the onely way
to conquer him, for he is angry becauſe you goe
without it.</p>
            <p>Your Coward, whom neceſſity and vain-glory
have drawn into the field, at his return from ſilly
ſervice, in frighting language uſher'd in with
oathes, deſcribes how many townes they burnt,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:111271:5"/>
how many women great with child were ſlaine,
how many men blowne up at the ſpringing of a
mine, how deſperately he returned their hand
Granadoes into the enemies worke after the fire
was given; that in a ſet battaile he was forced to
march up to the knees in bloud, and ſtumble over
carkaſes; when (poore ſcab) perhaps you might
have found him aſleep in the greazie armes of his
Sutlers wife, or drunke under the barrels; theſe
are the men that cry aloud in Taverns <hi>By the faith
of a ſouldier;</hi> draw their ſwords often, and ſweare
it is that they get their living by; weare great
Belts, and hats cut on the brim; great ſpurs, and
uncompt haire, with a black taffety playſter croſſe
the noſe. I would have a compleat Engliſh Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
ſouldier obſerve ſuch ſots, to loathe them,
and take theſe few inſtructions as true rules to
fight by:
<list>
                  <item>1. To examine the cauſe,</item>
                  <item>2. (If his cauſe be juſt) to ſpend a little griefe he
hath that cauſe.</item>
                  <item>3. To come on boly and cheerfully without deſire of
bloud.</item>
                  <item>4. Not to make gaine, or vain-glory his onely object.</item>
                  <item>5. To be mercifull to a couchant enemie, and not to
kill where he may ſave with his owne ſafety.</item>
                  <item>6. And laſtly, to aſcribe the honour of the conqueſt
not due to his valour, but the all providence of his Maker.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>If he can doe this, let him gird his ſword about
his loynes, and fight couragiouſly; <hi>Jehovah</hi> is his
Generall.</p>
