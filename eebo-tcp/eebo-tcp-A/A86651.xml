            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>TO all you who profeſs the name of our Lord Jeſus in words, and makes mention of his words, and of his Miniſters words, who had the everlaſting Goſpel and the word of reconciliation; and of thoſe practiſes which the Churches of Chriſt had in their day committed unto them, after they were gathered out of the world, and had denied it and its nature, and were not conformable to it, but were chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in their inward man, &amp; fruits of righteouſneſs were brought forth, and they were as lights in the world, and did bear wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs againſt the world, that they were evill; and ſaid they were of God, and had the witneſs in themſelves, and were bold to ſay the whole world lay in wickedneſs. To you who are called ſeparated Churches and fellowſhips, under this or that name; to you I write; my ſoul pities you above the reſt of the world; and in love to thoſe deſires which was once among you, I write; that ſo if it be poſſible you may come to ſee your ſelves and the foundation on which you ſtand, that thoſe deſires which was after God begotten, may not wholly be ſlayn, extinguiſhed, and betrayed, through the ſubtiltie of the ſerpent, whoſe wayes are crooked, and whoſe ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiltie is great, to keep man under his power.</p>
            <p>This I have to ſay unto you: There was and is a zeale in you, but not according to knowledge: bear my words, and judge that in your ſelves which would be angry. There was that which ſhewed you the Nationall way of worſhip under Epiſcopacie and Prelacy, and Presbyterie; which is one in the ground and nature that this was, the broad way, and not according to the mind of the Lord; neither was it accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to precept, nor the practiſes of the Churches of Chriſt; which is cleare from the Scripture: Now you ſeeing this was not according to Chriſt, nor his Miniſters, nor the Churches; you began to ſeparate from them into this or that body, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this or that name, as a body ſeparate from the world and their worſhip; becauſe you found in the writings of that which is called the Goſpel, people be gathered out of the world: now your eyes being ſtill without you, conformed to
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:116522:4"/>
their practiſes, as you judged, both in matter and manner; and practiſing thoſe things which you read in the Scripture that the Churches practiſed, and ſo ſome zealous did go forth and gather people together in this or that forme: and here was your beginning; and ſo here you ſet up your reſt, that you walk according to the moſt exact patern that is viſible or written: yet ſince this you do not agree, but are divided in your ſelves; one ſets up this, and another that thing, which you in your reaſon judge right. Now many things I might write unto you, which you cannot bear; but rather in love a few words, that you may ſee the vaſt difference betwixt your aſſemblies and Churches, and the Churches which you ſay is your example.</p>
            <p>And firſt of all, I will ſhow in the ground how far you fall ſhort: although it may be you may hate my inſtruction, yet I ſay, Suffer me a little, for I am one who have obtained mercy, after a long and a ſore travel, and toſſed up and downe in great tempeſts, but at laſt entered into the everlaſting reſt, and do not deſire to contend with you; for out of debates carnal I am brought; but rather in love to the honeſty in you all, which is not of this world, I ſpeake.</p>
            <p>Firſt, they received power from on high, and commiſſion given to preach the Goſpel to all nations. I ſpeak of the Miniſters of Chriſt; and thoſe things which they had heard, and ſeen, and felt, and taſted of, and had handled, of the word of life; which life was manifeſt in them; this they preached, and were ſent to turne people from darkneſs to light, and from Satan's power unto God's power; and as many as received and believed the word which they preached, which was the word of faith; and faith was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten by the preaching of it, and they heard and learned of the word of life: fayth came by hearing that word: and this word which they preached unto them, was nigh them, in their mouth and in their heart, which as people turned to it, and received it, and believed; ſo a change was wrought in the hearers of it; and they were turned from dead workes unto the meaſure of the living God, and they ſeparated from
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:116522:4"/>
the temple, and left Circumciſion, and all thoſe things of the firſt Prieſthood, which were commanded by God, and out of the worlds ways, faſhion, cuſtom, worſhips; and came to ſee the worſhipping in ſpirit and truth, was that worſhip God required; and the ground of their ſeparation was not from any literal command or precept; for all that was written there, was flat againſt it; but they which were Miniſters of Chriſt, which had believed in him, preached him the ſubſtance, and the meaſure of him and of his grace which was in them unto whom they preached; and this was the Apoſtles witneſs in their hearts, unto which they did commend themſelves in the ſight of God, which is a great myſtery; and they are not Miniſters of the letter, but of the ſpirit. Now in theſe few words before written; with much more I could write, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare your Miniſtry and your members gathered; and you will ſee you differ in the ground in the firſt; for your command you take from the letter, and ſo are miniſters of the letter, and not of the ſpirit.</p>
            <p>2. Ye preach the letter for the word of faith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which they did not, as is playne in their own writings, without adding.</p>
            <p>3. Them whom you gather, its but into conformity to the letter, and to that which is viſible: which all this may be done in the will of man, which is fallen from God; and ſee if it be not ſo with you, both Paſtors and Members, not witneſſes of that word which they preached, which did beget faith in them that received it, and believed in it; which faith was in them, wrought by the power of God, which gave them aſſurance, and their aſſurance was in them, and their hope in them, brought in, and wrought by the operation of the Spirit: which the preaching of the letter, ſound, or declaration only of that which was in them, never workes aſſurance, nor true faith, nor hope. And now conſider where had your ground of the knowledge of God been, and your Goſpel, and your faith, and hope, if you had not had the letter. I ſpeak not to upbraid you, but to the light of Chriſt Jeſus I ſpeake, which will let you ſee how far ſhort you are, and that you muſt come backe againe to the firſt principle:
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:116522:5"/>
and now you may ſee, if it had been the ſame word or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, it would have the ſame effects as it had, and Change into it's own nature all that received it: now ſee what Change is in you or not; ſome of you, yea, many running back after the foot-ſteps of the prieſts, preaching for hire, and uphold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Idols Temple, if you can get into them, and in the coſtomes of the world; nay, moſt of you not come to yea and nay in your communication, but one with the world in all or moſt of things, differ only in words and names; and your Goſpel you have preached, hath nor begotten ſuch a faith as was in them that had the Goſpel, not to reſpect perſons; nor none dare own cleanſing from ſin in the body, but calls that a deluſion: but the word and faith which they preached and received, gave them victory over the world, ſin and death; and by it's power made them more then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querors, and their hope purified their hearts: but you cannot believe that ever you ſhall be made free from ſin, nor hath not hope in that, and therefore are ignorant of the body of Chriſt you ſo much talk on, which made them clean and free from ſin.</p>
            <p>Secondly, your Doctrine is the ſame with the world; your hope, your faith, your juſtification is all at a diſtance ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon the report of Chriſt dying at <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> and of their report that knew him: and believing this, you call it faith, and ſo are one with the faith and hope which the world hath: for the report of Chriſts righteouſneſs, what he did ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, and wrought in the Saints, if this be the ground of ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, then why have you ſeparated from the world? If you ſay<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Becauſe the world hath not right to the Ordinances: I ſay, Doth not faith in Chriſt give Intereſt to all his ordinances? And if this be onely your faith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the world hath as good an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt as you: ſo why do you ſeparate from them? And ſo you ſhall ſee the matter is the ſame with the world, of which your fellowſhips conſiſts; and the name of Chriſt is a great myſtery, which they were ſent to baptize in<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who knew his name: his name is not letters and ſyllables, and uſing theſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> this with the lips ſpeaking over, is not to baptize into his name: And ſo, friends, in love I ſpeak unto you: There was ſuch as ſeparated
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:116522:5"/>
themſelves, and were ſenſual, and had not the ſpirit; and ſo there was no difference betwixt them and the world, for they are clouds without rayn; appeared wells, but had no wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in them; ſeemed ſomething, but were but a ſhow. Freinds, your foot-ſteps I know; your ground I know, and your compaſs and your meaſure; yet I ſhall not glory over you, nor boaſt my ſelfe againſt you; but rather, to informe your minde, that you may not build upon a foundation which will moulder away: and now boaſt not your ſelves in your Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, as water, bread and wine, which is but elementarie, and was never but a ſigne; and in the day of appearance of Chriſt, the elements ſhall melt with fervent heat; and while you ſtand here, and have confidence in theſe things, your ſun will ſet in obſcuritie, and you ſhall know the old heavens and earth will paſs away with a noyſe; which when you come to know and heare, your hearts will fayle for fear: for this I ſay to the higheſt of you, If you build upon any thing, or have confidence in any thing which ſtands in time, and is on this ſide Eternity, and the Being of beings, your foundation will be ſwept away, and night will come upon you; and all your gathered in things, and taken on, and imitated, will all fayle you.</p>
            <p>Many more things I might write, time would fayle me to utter; but theſe few among many, I have written, that you may compare your ſelves with the Miniſters of Chriſt then; and the Goſpel which they preached, which were ſeparate from the world in the ground and nature: and if you ſee your ſelves in the light of Chriſt in your conſciences, not to be the ſame, neither in matter nor maner, let not a deceived heart lead you aſide any longer.</p>

            <p>O what righteouſneſs is that you lay hold of, which is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect, and leads not out of imperfection? that is not true faith that lays hold on a righteouſneſs which is imperfect: and all of you ſay, all that is in you there is defects and Imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in it, yea even the graces and gifts of God, you ſay they are Imperfect: then Conſider, if you ſee Imperfection in all thoſe things you have laid hold on, and have received, then you know not faith, nor grace, nor the gift of God, which is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect; but believes in a dream of a thing done, and an apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of a thing at a diſtance without you: Imagining you are eating, but when you awake you are hungry; Imagining you are ſaved, but when you enter into your Hearts, ſee nothing witneſſed, nothing done, nor redeemed from nothing; your faith and hope ſtands in works, and that is all; preaching the letter over, and proving that which is proved, and was proved in them that witneſſed the life of thoſe things in them that are written: but nothing is proved in you, but applies their

            <p>Awake, awake; Ariſe, ariſe, and ſtand all up to judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: let the heathen be awakened, for the Lord ſhall roare out of <hi>Sion,</hi> and utter his voice as a whirlwind; and the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens and the earth ſhall ſhake, and the mountains ſhall melt at his preſence, and all the hills ſhall melt before him, and all the Iſles ſhall flie away at his preſence, who is riſen to take Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance upon all the ungodly; and all ſhall be ſlain before him.

Awake, all you that are aſleep, and ſtand up to Judgement; the Angell of the Covenant is come, and the time of harveſt draws neer; the reaper is come with his ſharp Sickle, and is come, for the preſs is full, and the fats overflow; for their wickedneſs is great: Multitudes, multitudes ſhall be ſlain, and bound in bundles, and caſt into the lake, and into the valley of deciſion: the Sun and the Moon ſhall withdraw their ſhining, and the ſtars ſhall fall, and loſe their light; yet a little while and time ſhall be no longer, but you will be ſwept into the pit, where ſhall be weeping and wailing, and gnaſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of teeth, and overturned as <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrha,</hi> and you ſhall know there is a God, who is pure and holy, who will judge you not according to your words and feigned de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfull hearts, but in righteouſneſs.
