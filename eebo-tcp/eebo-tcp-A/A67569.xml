         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To the
READER.</head>
            <p>THE Author of this Book al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
he had never suffered
it to be published, had he not
been assured that it is not
(for the main) much liable
to just exception, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
he hath no further care of the reception
&amp; entertainment of it, then the consequence of it
may deserve (whereof the Reader and not him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
must be the Judge.) And so he is not moved
by the common passions of such as use to make
Epistles and Prefaces, to their Readers, yet some
thing although but for custome only he was wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to premise, and to acquaint the Reader with
thus much by way of Apology for himself.</p>
            <p>That this was written divers years since
without any purpose of ever letting it go abroad,
<pb facs="tcp:115953:3"/>
that the chief end of it was to cleer to himself
who is a lover of rationall knowledge, an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of the grounds of his own belief, and to
that end to lay in order his scattered notions
concerning that subject; and this he intends as
an Apology for the homelinesse of the stile.</p>
            <p>That at the same time when it was written,
it was also delivered in a private course of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
exercise, and that will be the excuse
for such repetitions as might otherwise seem ill-favoured
in the severall Sections of it.</p>
            <p>That at the time of his composing it, he
was destitute of the assistance of his Bookes,
which is one cause that it is not adorned with
Testimonies and citations out of Authors, but
comes out naked, being supported onely by
the order and plainnesse of reason that it
trusts to.</p>
            <p>That since the composing of this he knows
that divers Bookes of the same Argument have
been written by men farre more knowing then
himselfe, but that he hath not yet read any of
them, nor knows whether he doe agree with them
or not, which abstinence hath been caused part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
for that he is himselfe satisfied by what is
here delivered, and partly for that he had no
leisure or minde to alter this which he had done,
though possibly it might be for the better.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:115953:3"/>That whereas he speakes of <hi>Epicures, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiavelians,</hi>
and the like, he makes use of
those names onely in a popular way as they are
names of Characters well known amongst us,
and that he intends not to traduce those Authors
or cast any contumely upon them.</p>
            <p>Lastly, He must needs acknowledge, that
before the edition of this he hath seen M. <hi>Hobs</hi>
his Leviathan, and other Bookes of his, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
that which is in this Treatise intended as the
main Foundation whereon the second Discourse
<hi>(Of the Souls Immortality)</hi> insists, is
said to imply a contradiction, <hi>viz. That there
are any such things as Immateriall or
Incorporeall substances.</hi> Upon which oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
he thought good onely to say, That he
hath a very great respect and a very high esteem
for that worthy Gentleman, but he must inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuously
acknowledge that a great proportion of it
is founded upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a belief &amp; expectation concerning
him, a belief of much knowledge in him, and
an expectation of those Philosophicall and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematicall
works, which he hath undertaken;
and not so much upon what he hath yet publish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to the world, and that he doth not see reason
from thence to recede from any thing upon his
Authority, although he shall avouch his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
to proceed Mathematically. That he is
<pb facs="tcp:115953:4"/>
sure he hath much injured the Mathematicks,
and the very name of Demonstration, by bestow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it upon some of his discourses, which are
exceedingly short of that evidence and truth
which is required to make a discourse able to
bear that reputation.</p>
            <p>That in this case M.<hi>H.</hi> is onely a negative
witnesse, and his meaning in denying incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reall
substances, can rationally import no more
but this, that he himself hath not an apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of any such beings, and that his cogitation
(as to the simple objects of it) hath never ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen
beyond imagination, or the first apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of bodies performed in the brain; but to
imagine that no man hath an apprehension of
the God-head, because he may not perhaps think
of him so much as to strip off the corporeall cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances
wherewith he doth use to fancy him;
Or to conclude every man under the sentence of
being non-sensicall, whosoever have spoken or
written of Incorporeall substances, he doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
to be things not to be made good by the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of M. <hi>Hobs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That whereas very many men do professe an
apprehension of such beings, and he in the mean
time professes this to be impossible, this Author
is hard put to it to excuse this from much inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility,
and conceives the import of it to amount
<pb facs="tcp:115953:4"/>
to thus much, that he conceives himself in the
highest and utmost bound of humane apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
and that his reason is the measure of truth,
and that what he sees not is invisible, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the case in this to be alike, as if whilest
two men are looking at <hi>Jupiter,</hi> one with his
naked eyes, the other with a Telescope; the
former should avow that <hi>Jupiter</hi> had no atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants,
and that it were impossible he should
have any: the reason why M.<hi>H.</hi> denies those
beings whilest other men apprehend them, is for
that he lookes at them with his Fancy, they with
their minde.</p>
            <p>Many more things he had to say for himself,
but he understands not fully the use or benefit of
Apologies.</p>

               <p>ALthough I am not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
apprehension, that
the discourse which I
design may be prejud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
unprofitable, as
pretending to lay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
that foundation which hath long
since been layed in the mindes of all
that will be readers of it; yet when I
consider those scandals which the loose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of our times have offered even to
the religious, and the bold and horrid
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:115953:10"/>
pride and presumption of Atheists and
Epicures, which by a prophane and
confident asserting the uncertainty of
all things (undervaluing the abilities
of our Natures to raise an opinion of
their personall excellencies) have la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured
to introduce into the world a
generall Athiesm, or at least a doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
Scepticism in matters of Religion:
And when we consider the nature of
our mindes, which is upon any ill sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gestions
apt still to receive some im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression
(those things being of like o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration
with Calumny, which if it
be confidently and boldly charged, will
be sure to leave some scarre behinde it.)
When we observe this use and inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in our selves which is in things
where we have not a belief of what is
spoken, or do not give perfect credit
to an accusation, yet to admit of a sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion
that things may be as they are
spoken; and although the strength of
our contrary beleef do keep us from a
full assenting to the thing in question,
yet if it happen that the things concern
our selves, and we have happened to
crosse our opinions, or our beleef in
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:115953:10"/>
our way of practise, such is the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versenesse
of our hearts, that in such

I cannot think it uselesse, nay not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necessary,

neglecting the more knowing party of

               </list>
               <p>WE may begin with the conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of the definition (and
the design of our selves in the matter)
of Religion; however the practise of
the world may contradict it; I hope
we may take this definition of Religion
as one that is agreeable to the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension
which all of us have of it. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
is a resignation of our selves to
God, with an expectation of reward;
The designe indeed of Religion, howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
it ought to be meerly obedience to
the pleasure and the will of God, and
height of it is barely terminated in his
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:115953:11"/>
glory, (so that the highest act of it is
Adoration) yet I say the designe of
mens Religion is that it may be well
unto themselves, and to bring them to
an estate of happinesse. The very defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition
of Religion supposeth a God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head,
according to that of the Apostle,
<hi>He that cometh to God must believe that God
is.</hi> The very designe of it supposeth that
both the party worshipping is capable
of rewards, and that God likewise doth
not neglect his services (in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
words of the Apostle) that he is
the rewarder of those that diligently
seek him.</p>
               <p>Again, the resignation of our selves
supposeth the resignation of our su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
faculties, those are our under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standings
and our wils, <hi>viz.</hi> our wils to
an obedience to his will, to a perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance
of his injunctions, to a submis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
to his providence; and a resigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
likewise of our understandings to
his truth. Now it is agreeable to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
as well as to the Apostle, that we
cannot practise the will of God, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
we know it, and that we cannot
know it unlesse it be discovered to us.
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:115953:12"/>
So then in our profession of Religion,
there are these supposals. That there is
a God; and That he is a rewarder of
those that seek him (and that suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
that they are capable of his
way of rewarding;) That the dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
of our seeking must be exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
in a way conformable to his will;
and That to this purpose we want not
rules for this conformity. These are I
say the generall suppositions of every
Religion under Heaven. You see that
the being of Religion is in self-resigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
but the end of that resignation it
is reward (still retaining in minde that
caution, that mercenarily to labour for
reward is not the supream exaltation
of Religious acts, but that it is the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
degree of mens Religion, and
an allowable and commendable step,
and a degree unto the other; it being
the strong powerfull motive to <hi>Moses</hi> to
neglect the momentany pleasures of
<hi>Pharaohs</hi> Court, because he had respect
unto the recompense of reward:) I say
it is the naturall way of reason in every
act to look at some or other end, and to
undertake no labour without an eye
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:115953:12"/>
upon reward. Now so it is, that some
men who account themselves the wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sest,
observing as they think the design
and issue of Religion, and comparing
the labour and the wages, they with
much wisedome as they think, conclude
that all the businesse of gain which
comes by Religion is no way worth the
pain and labour. They see that all
things come alike to all, there is but
one issue to the just, and to the unjust;
nay, they think they see that the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse
of things it is not equall to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
and irreligious; but that besides
the pleasures and enjoyments which
religious men doe fondly deny them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
besides that melancholy life
which they by their strictnesse and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisenesse
bring upon themselves, they
often anticipate and hinder the thri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
and successe of their own designes
by a dangerous and prejudiciall scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulosity:
whereas the other party be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
the pleasure of their lives in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate,
they carry matters of state, and
either by force or fraud they circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
and overcome the narrow and fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
spirits of the others; and the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:115953:13"/>
of things they oft observe to be
answerable to this Hypothesis, ready
they are to say with those in <hi>Mal.</hi> 3. 14.
<hi>Surely it is in vain to serve God, and what
profit is it to keep his Ordinances, to walke
mournfully before the Lord of Hosts, whereas
we see the proud happy, and they that work
wickednesse are set up, and they that tempt, God
are even delivered?</hi> Upon such observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
upon the reward, they conclude
clean contrary to the suppositions of
Religion, God is no rewarder of those
that seek him; such as deny themselves
the most for him, they have no other
reward but sadnesse of soul and debili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of body, and exility of fortune:
surely if he were a God, he would not
thus desert his party, and give them o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
to the scorn and derision, and mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
of the world: surely therefore
there is no God, or surely he sees it not,
or tush God cares not for it, and so
these mens Religion is vain: or else
these men they have not hit upon the
true way of worship, the rules they go
by they are uncertain, that which they
pretend to be the word of God, it is
not so, but some bundle of Impostures,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:115953:13"/>
devised by some body, and put upon
these simple people to delude them,
they indeed flatter themselves with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations
when they are dead, but
those are but vain, for who knows that
the spirit of a man goes upward, and
that the spirit of a beast goes down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward?
as a man dies, so dies a beast,
wherefore let us eat and drink, for to
morrow we shall die. These are the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of those allegations which by A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theists,
Epicures, and Machivillians are
set in competition with Religion: these
are those Engines by which the devill
hath prevailed to the seduction of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
and to the entertainment of a
suspicion by men, otherwise prudent
and sober-minded: the main foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations
upon which we differ they are
these.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. The Being and providence of God.</item>
                  <item>2. The Immortality of the soul.</item>
                  <item>3. The Authority of the holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Before we come therefore to the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
mysteries of faith, it is necessary
that these be cleared before we come
to settle in particular differences of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:115953:14"/>
that we justifie our selves against
the petulances of those men that would
laugh and scoff us out of all Religion;
crying to every party (as they see the
variable chances of the world to give
occasion) where is now their God?
Indeed if there were not a God to
worship, or if God did not see, and
regard, and reward our worship, or
had we no rule to work by, we should
have none encouragement to Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
Nay, upon all that happens to
men in this life, we cannot but allow,
that, upon their supposition, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
not irrationally. Concurre we
must with our Apostle, that <hi>If in this
life only we had hope, we were of all men most
miserable;</hi> But we know assuredly that
thou God seest, and that thou hast gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
us thy holy Word to be a light to
our feet, and a lanthorn to our paths;
and that though now we see but
through a glasse darkly, yet the time is
coming when we shall see thee face to
face. The state of the controversie then
is this, which of the parties is in the
wisest way; The Atheist thinks that
the Religious is a fool; the Religious,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:115953:14"/>
that he is a fool that saith in his heart
there is no God: The Athiest that the
souls of men are mortall as the souls
of beasts; the Religious, that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theist
is a beast to say so, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But such
kindes of contests are vain, wherefore
let's see where the truth lies.</p>

               <p>THe Question is, Whether or no
there be a God?</p>
               <p>And here first I must entreat that it
may be remembred what that party is
which defends the negative, and what
is the designe that we are upon, that
so the following discourse be not
thought uselesse or industriously set out
of our ordinary road. Our enemies are
Atheists: and that which is to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:115953:15"/>
is the Atheisticall pronenesse of
men; so that in the controverted que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions
it will not be a sufficient way of
answering, to say that the Scriptures
and the Spirit of God make it evident
that there is a God; and again that the
Scriptures are evinced to be the Word
of God by the Spirit of God bearing
witnesse with the heart of man. It is
true, that the Scriptures clearly deliver
that there is a God, and as true it is
that God by his grace doth work the
heart of man to a beleeving of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures:
these things they are really
true to those who already are beleevers,
and each of them conduceth to a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation
of each other: but to a man
that doubts of the Godhead, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
the Scriptures, to use those argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
for satisfaction, were to minister
a scandall to him, and by circular way
of reasoning and assuming <hi>gratis</hi> the
matter of the question (for they doe
no otherwise who only say, We must
beleeve the Scriptures to be the Word
of God, because God saies so, and a
God we must beleeve because the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures
say so) to make them think we
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:115953:15"/>
have no more to say but this, it is so be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it is so: and so confirm them in
their Atheism and irreligion. It was a
certain observation of <hi>Aristotle,</hi> that <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> in every acquisition of knowledge, the
understanding doth proceed from pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises
which were known, to the infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
of a new conclusion, which was
before unknown: and so was that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Aphorism of his, that there is no
disputation unlesse upon principles,
which are confessed on both sides, and
such only are the common principles of
intelligence, and the plain discoveries
of the senses there where the mysteries
of faith are questioned; it will not be
sufficient therefore in the present case,
to alledge that saying of the Apostle,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 20. <hi>For the invisible things of him
from the creation of the world are clearly seen,
being understood by the things that are made,
even his eternall power and Godhead; so that
they are without excuse:</hi> but we must clear,
and demonstrate the truth of that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legation,
by reasons taken from things
visible: however, it may be lawfull for
us to make use of the direction of this
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:115953:16"/>
place, as a canon for our enquiry, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
not of the authority of it, as a
sufficient argument to enforce a belief
from the gainsayer. I say therefore that
an eternall power may beevinced from
the creation of the world, and that the
creation of the world may be demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated
from the consideration of things
visible, so that by Reason as well as
Faith (though not so readily) we may
be brought to understand that the
world was made of things which dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appear.
I say, that the world was not
eternall but created, is demonstrable
from things that are visible; our argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
shall be from generation: What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
is begotten was begotten of some
other, for nothing can possibly beget,
or make it self, otherwise it will follow
that the same thing is and is not both at
one instant, seeing it is both the produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer
and the thing to be produced: it is
to be produced, and so it is not yet, it is
likewise a producer, and that supposeth
that it is in being: It is therfore in being,
and it is not in being, that's a manifest
contradiction: Wherefore nothing can
generate, or make, or produce it self:
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:115953:16"/>
Wherefore every thing that is begotten,
is begotten of some other, and then the
other which begat it either was it self
in the same manner begotten, or it was
not, if it was not, we are already come
to the first principle which was unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten,
and so have discovered a God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head:
If it was begotten, either we must
follow up the course of successive gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
to some first production from a
cause eternal, or else we must necessarily
say that the course of generations had
no beginning, and consequently that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
successions are already past, which
is as much as to acknowledge that an
infinite number of successions are past,
and if past, then they are at an end; so
we have found an infinite which hath
had an end, that is another contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.
Again, if any shall affirm that
the course of generation had no begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
but that the number of them
hath been infinite, let us put a case and
reason with him: we will imagine the
generations of <hi>Abraham</hi> for example,
and of <hi>Joseph,</hi> the sonne of <hi>Jacob,</hi> the
son of <hi>Isaack,</hi> the sonne of <hi>Abraham.</hi> I
demand therefore whether before the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:115953:17"/>
birth of <hi>Abraham,</hi> there had past an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
series of generations or not? if
the series was finite, the work of gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
had beginning, which is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion
I contend for, if the series past
was infinite, then at the birth of <hi>Ioseph</hi>
'tis evident that more generations were
past, so we have found a number grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
then that which was supposed to be
infinite, and consequently that was not
infinite, so it was both infinite and not
infinite, a manifest contradiction: but if
we say that <hi>Abrahams</hi> series was infinite,
and that so was <hi>Iosephs</hi> also, then it will
follow that the number of <hi>Abrahams</hi>
was equall to the number of <hi>Iosephs,</hi> but
<hi>Abrahams</hi> was but a part of <hi>Iosephs,</hi>
wherefore the part is equall to the
whole. Else admit that <hi>Abrahams</hi> was
finite, but when it came to <hi>Ioseph,</hi> that
then the number was infinite, it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
then that a finite number added
to a finite shall make an infinite, which
likewise is against the common light of
reason. We see therefore that supposing
the eternity of the world, or the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of generations doth force the
minde to contradictions, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:115953:17"/>
the fiction is vain, and utterly
impossible; and as we have argued in
the way of generation, so we may like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
in every thing where there is mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
or mutation, that is in all the
parts of the visible world, the creation
therefore of the world from the visible
things thereof, is manifest, which was
to be demonstrated, and from the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
of the world we may infer those
invisible Attributes of the Eternity and
Power, and wisedome, and Providence
of God, that which rests yet to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrated.</p>

               <p>THat which we are yet upon, it is
a generall introduction to Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and a demonstration of the Neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:115953:18"/>
of it against Atheists and Epicures,
and such as are the despisers of it: that
which we pretend is that their rejection
of Religion cannot proceed from any
considerate solid reasoning of their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding,
but from an evill disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of their affections, which makes
them, we beleeve, rather wish, and so
give out that their assertions are true,
then that themselves beleeve them to be
so; particularly in that grand princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
and fundamentall of a God, and of
a Providence, from whence the rest will
freely and naturally follow: We have
by plain and easie demonstration evin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,
that from the visible things of this
world, the creation of it may be evict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
and that the Apostle, although to
such as were initiated in Christianity,
he did propose it upon the well attest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
authority of the Spirit of God, by
many mighty signs and wonders decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to be with him: although to them
he thought it needlesse any more then
to referre them to the naturall princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of their understandings: yet that
he was not wanting to the infidels, but
by designing to them so ready a topike
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:115953:18"/>
or medium; from whence to beginne
their argument hath not deserved of the
unbeleeving that slender estimation
which they have been pleased to afford
him: there is no action or mutation in
any thing visible whatsoever, but it is
performed by motion, nor any moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
followed home successively through
it's causes, but will force the minde of
man to a first mover, which is it self
unmoved, and though for some rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
I did propose the argument in the
name of generation, yet if in the place
of it you should have been pleased
to substitute motion in generall, or bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
action (for either they are formal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the same, or consequent at least to
one another) the variation of the terms
of the argument would no way have
changed the substance of the conclusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
which I intimate to give notice
of the sufficiency of that argument,
which in it self comprizes a multitude
of others more particular, lest any ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
might possibly be made against
the want of number in my argument.
Well, having concluded the creation,
and beginning of the world, we see it
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:115953:19"/>
follows that thence we conclude the
eternall power and God-head, that is,
the eternity and power of the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head:
to which that we may fully
convince our Atheist, we will likewise
adde the wisedome, and providence,
and the immensity, and other attributes
of God.</p>
               <p>And first for Eternity,<note place="margin">Eternity.</note> we have by
undeniable consequence resolved all
motions in the world into the bosome
of a first mover, and if we suppose him
a first mover, this supposition will evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
conclude, that he is eternall, that
is that he is without beginning of es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence,
or without any term or limit of
duration; for if it had any beginning
of essence or duration, that beginning
of being presupposeth a priority of not
being (that is, that actuall being is not
of the essence of it) and so that we may
without any contradiction, suppose it
not to be yet in being, that is we may
bring our understanding without error
to the apprehension of it as being yet in
the state of power only, or potentiall
being, so as things are in their causes:
so then let us conceit it in this state, and
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:115953:19"/>
compare this state with the other when
it hath a being, and it evident that this
passage or transition from want of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to a being cannot be without a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
nor motion without an actuall
mover: but that which moves a thing
from not being to a state of being is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily
a precedent mover to that
which from it receives its being: so
then that which we supposed to be the
first originall mover, it will have a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
which shall of necessity have gone
before it, and consequently it will be
both a first and not a first mover, that
is a plain and evident contradiction.
Instead of multiplying Arguments
without necessity, we will only return
by the footsteps of our analysis, and
so from the being of a first mover con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
the Eternity: If it be a first mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
then it had no former mover, and
if so, then it never was produced from
not being unto being; and if so, then
it never had any beginning of its being,
then it is Eternall: therefore whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
is the first mover it must of necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
likewise be Eternall. But from the
common affections of things visible we
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:115953:20"/>
did before demonstrate an originall and
first mover, wherefore the visible things
of this world they likewise do evict the
Eternity of the Godhead.</p>
               <p>Having demonstrated the Eternity of
God, the rest of his Attributes, such as
we are able to comprehend in this life,
they all of them will follow, his Neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity,
Independency, Infinity, Unity, Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotency,
Omniscience.</p>
               <p>And first for his Necessity:<note place="margin">Necessity.</note> whereby
I mean his Necessity of being, not his
Necessity of operation, so as it is oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to freedom of will and power to
act, or to forbear. I say then, that the
Godhead is a necessary being, that is,
that it is impossible it should fail, and
implies a contradiction, that it should
not be, that is it which Divines mean,
when they say it is eternall, <hi>à parte post,</hi>
as well as <hi>à parte antè:</hi> for if it be not a
necessary being, that is, if necessity of
being be not included in the essence of
the God-head, then it is not impossible
that it should lose his being, that is, it
is possible that it should lose his being,
that is, it is in the power of something
to cause it to lose his being: but no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:115953:20"/>
can passe from being to not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
without a change or motion, so
then the motion of it is in the power of
some other, and consequently this is
not the first originall of motion, but
that other; but we supposed this to be
the originall of motion, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently,
It is not possible it should be
deprived of its being, that is, it is a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
being in respect of others, and
as impossible it is that it should lose its
being of it self. Indeed it is a manifest
contradiction, that any thing should
have a power over its own essence, and
needs no further conviction or opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
seeing the active power of any
thing is founded in the essence of it,
and consequently cannot exceed the es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
or bring it not to be: However
the necessity of the existence of God
will be evinced from the Simplicity<note place="margin">Simplicity</note> and
uncompounded property of his nature,
and that from his Eternity; for ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
him to be compounded, then it
must be of some principles of Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition,
and if so, then those principles
must be presupposed to his being, and
precede him in a priority of nature: so
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:115953:21"/>
then there will be somewhat in nature
before that which was before evinced,
and now supposed to be eternall: and
if he be a simple essence and eternall,
he must be purely actuall and nothing
potentiall, for if in his essence be any
thing potentiall, that is, if it be in any
possibility, that possibility relates to
some superiour and former cause:
Whereas we have all this while been
reasoning about the first cause and su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme:
Simple he is therefore and
pure, and a simple act out of the
bounds of possibility, and of suffering,
and so again we have concluded his ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity of being.</p>
               <p>Now as we have demonstrated his
Necessity, so likewise we may thence
collect his Independency.<note place="margin">Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency.</note> We are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
in a great deal of blindenesse in
the contemplation of the God-head,
and most humbly crave leave of God
to be admitted to enquire and speak af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the manner of men: God doth not
exact that we should exceed the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of our understandings in our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation
of him, or that we should
deliver him as he is in himself, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:115953:21"/>
then he is pleased to reveal
himself to our weak and feeble under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standings,
and so we hope his Majesty
will not be offended at us, if after the
manner of men we labour to deduce
one attribute out of another, if withall
we take this caution, that upon our
dependency of inference, and the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedency
and following in our dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,
we doe not conclude that suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession
or dependency of attributes in
God, and imagine that to be in the
object which is only in the Organ. I
could not but take this advantage for
this caution now, that from his Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
Simplicity, and Necessity I am
concluding his Independency; this,
to our understanding and discourse
may well enough (as concerning us)
depend upon those other, that is, the
supposition of those will force the
minde to an acknowledgement of this,
but to imagine that order to be in God,
were to imagine a contradiction, by
putting a dependency upon the attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
of Independency: If he be a sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
act and pure, it is impossible he
should at all depend upon another for
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:115953:22"/>
his being: for suppose his being to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
upon another, then that other
must necessarily be presupposed, and
he the cause likewise of his being; for
if it depend upon another for his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
his being cannot be without that
other, and so it is presupposed, and
therefore it is before this in order, and
as in order so in causality, for we speak
of a reall and essentiall dependency, not
of a Logicall or notionall; wherefore
this other, and not the God-head will
be a cause and a former cause; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
the God-head, unlesse it be
independent, will neither be the first
cause, nor eternall; contrary to that
which was before demonstrated.</p>
               <p>Again the Simplicity and the Impas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibility
of God will necessarily evict
him to be incorporeall,<note place="margin">Incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reality.</note> seeing that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
body is compounded and passible,
nay we may go so farre as to say that
corporeity is passibility, for corporeity
is quantity, and in the last abstracted
notion consists in three dimensions, but
quantity is nothing else but divisibility,
that is, an aptitude to suffer division,
that is passibility; whatsoever there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:115953:22"/>
is impassible, that likewise is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporeall
which was to be demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated.</p>
               <p>And if it be incorporeall, then like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
it is unbounded and unlimited by
place, for whether place be taken for
the surface of some ambient body, or
for a space, the very essence of a place
consists in relation to a body enclosed;
but that which is no body cannot ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
of an enclosure, therefore that
which is incorporeall is free from the
limits and terms of place, so then it is
euident that the first cause is free from
the limits and restraints of place, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we proved that it was free from
any limits of duration, but in the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
from time and place consists the
notion of immensity,<note place="margin">Immensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</note> and so the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mensity
of God is now demonstrated
(or, which is all one, his Infinity.)</p>
               <p>But if the God-head be infinite, then
likewise it is but one, and so we may
demonstrate the Unity<note place="margin">Unity.</note> of the essence of
the God-head. Now that there cannot
be two infinite essences we will demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate.
But first for the help of our ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination,
and to render that servicea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:115953:23"/>
to our understandings, we will i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magine
two bodies infinite, then thus,
either the one of those bodies is in all
the space wherein the other body is or
it is not: if they be both together in
the self same space, then that which is
the longitude of the one is the longi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of the other, and their latitude is
the same, and so likewise their profun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity
the same, I say not only equall:
for as from filling equallity of spaces
we must inferre equality of dimensions,
so from identity of space we must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
them to have the same dimensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
but the last and most abstracted
notion of a body is mathematically re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
into those dimensions, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
those which fill the self same space
are the self same body, and so two bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
they will be but one body, which
is a manifest contradiction: but if we
shall say that where one of these infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
bodies is, the other is not, then
there will be some space where one of
these bodies is excluded, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
it will be limited and finite,
which yet we supposed to be infinite;
so then, it will be infinite and not infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:115953:23"/>
which is a manifest contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
We have demonstrated therefore
that there cannot be two infinite bodies,
the truth is we ought to demonstrate
that there cannot be two infinite essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
but the notion of being and essence
is so abstracted and high, that it would
strein our understanding to keep it so
long intent upon its abstracted object,
as were required to goe through a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration
where infinite simple being
should be the subject, and unity the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
to be demonstrated, but if we
shall proceed but to other degrees, as
for example, of power, or wisedom, or
the like, the demonstration will run as
clear to the minde, as in the case of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
it did to the fancy: for either
those infinite powers are the same, or
not the same; if they by the same, then
it is but one power which was vainly
imagined to be two: but if the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
be not the same, then one power is
where the other power is not (not
meaning <hi>in ubi</hi> of place, but of case)
and consequently a case where one of
the powers is not, and consequently
the power is limited, which yet is sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:115953:24"/>
to be infinite, there can be there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
but one infinite power, nor any
more then one infinite essence, and so
we have demonstrated the Unity of the
God-head.</p>
               <p>It remains that we demonstrate the
Omnipotence of God, and his Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science:<note place="margin">Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence.</note>
and first for his Omnipotence,
That God was a God of power it was
demonstrated then when we found him
to be the first cause, and originall mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
and the creator of the world, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
we demonstrated that he is sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
and free from all manner of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position,
purely actuall, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
doth not consist of subject and
accidents: his power therefore is no
accident to his being, but his power is
his being, and his being having been
demonstrated to be immense and infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite,
his power likewise must be illimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and infinite, and conseqently he is
Omnipotent.</p>
               <p>The same argument will prove him
likewise to be Omniscient,<note place="margin">Omnisci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</note> for as he is
the first cause of every thing created;
so likewise of all the created know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
and consequently all know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:115953:24"/>
is derived from him, wherefore
it is primitively in him, and then it
follows that his knowledge and his es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
is the same as well as his power,
and his being; therefore as that is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite,
so is this likewise: and so we
have evicted his Omnisciency, that is
an infinite knowledge, which includes
in it the knowledge of all particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars,
for if any particular in the
world were excluded it were not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite,
but limited; so then the thoughts
of the heart are open to the the view
of his Omniscience: And thus ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to that Canon of direction,
which we took from the Apostle, we
have proceeded, and that strictly and
warily, according to the laws of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration,
and from the visible
things of this world, enforcing our
selves first to an acknowledgement of
the creation of the world we have
thence; taking in only the common
principles and common notions
(<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) of intelligence, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
higher, to a demonstration of
the eternall power and God-head:
that is, of those Attributes of the

and Atheists have been pretended not

to that which is to be delivered.</p>
               <p>Now the substance of all that I shall
speak towards the demonstration of the
souls Immortality shall be summarily
comprised in this one Syllogism.</p>
               <p>Whatsoever substance is incorpore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
it is immortall. But the souls of
men are incorporeall substances, <hi>Ergo,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The former of these Propositions is
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:115953:27"/>
indeed in it self undemonstrable, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a principle evident to a considering
minde, and so not resolvible into any
former principles, so that all that can
be done to a further clearing of it will
only be to examine and follow home
the terms, to their first originall noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
which they are assigned to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent.
Indeed the word mortality, as it
is usually apprehended, hath alwaies
reference to a compounded substance,
or to a body which hath in it self some
principle and cause of motion, and
signifies no more but a capacity of the
materiall and passive part, to be depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
of that inward active principle of
its motions, as is evident by those
things which we use to say may die, or
are dead, as men, and beasts, and
plants: but when the question is only
of that active principle, it cannot so
justly be put in the terms of mortality,
as of corruptibility, or a naturall ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency
to a corruption: so then that
which we are to strive for is the true
and accurate notion of corruption,
and when we have driven it to the
highest, we shall finde that corruption
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:115953:27"/>
is nothing else but a dissolution of
things joyned together, and that this
dissolution is nothing but a separation,
and that separation is nothing but di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision,
and that division is an immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
and â formall act of quantity, and
quantity is nothing else but a mode of
corporeity, so as you see that corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptibility
doth even in the notion of it
include corporeity: whatsoever there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
is incorporeall it is incorruptible,
which was to be demonstrated.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>A Proof of this Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that the souls of men
are incorporeall substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
by comparing the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
of bodies with
those of souls.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>BUt the souls of men are incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reall
substances.</p>
               <p>That they are substances is evident,
seeing that they are subjects of certain
properties and affections, which is the
very formall notion of a substance. It
remains only therefore that we demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate
them to be incorporeall.</p>
               <p>Now for the clearing of this it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite
that we consider wherein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists
the being of a body, and wherein
consists the being of an humane soul:
nor can we use any possible means to
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:115953:28"/>
come to an apprehension of their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
but by considering those primary
passions and properties whereby they
make discovery of themselves: the first
and primary affection of a body is that
extension of parts whereof it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded,
and a capacity of division,
upon which as upon the fundamentall
mode the particular dimensions (that
is the figures) and the locall motions
doe depend, the figure being nothing
but a particular and determined ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tension
of the matter, towards such
and such parts, and locall motion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
nothing but division, so that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
may possibly be performed by
any body, it must have its originall
ground-work in divisibility, and its a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall
being in division towards which
the situation and figure and determined
quantity of parts must make the dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition.</p>
               <p>Again for the being of our souls if
we reflect upon our selves we shall
finde that all our knowledge of them
resolves into this, that we are beings
conscious to our selves of severall
kindes of cogitations, that by our out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:115953:29"/>
senses we apprehend bodily
things present, that by our Imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
we apprehend things absent, that we
oft recover into our apprehensions
things past and gone, that upon our
perception of things we finde our selves
variously affected, sometimes with
pleasure or pain for things present,
sometimes with hope or despair of
things absent, and the like: Nay, we
are conscious to our selves of objects,
which could not by any bodily im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions
be wrought in our fancies or
our brain; and of superiour passions
answerable to those objects. In one
word, we finde that our souls are a
kinde of essences which are conscious
(or having a sence) of things.</p>
               <p>Now then we are to compare toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
these two properties of a body and
a soul, and so conclude either an agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
or a disagreement in the natures
of those subjects. And here upon the
very first view of a considering minde
it will appear that divisibility is not
apprehension, or judgement, or desire,
or discourse, that to cut a body into
severall parts, or put it into severall
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:115953:29"/>
shapes, or bring it to severall motions,
or mix it after severall waies, will not
serve to bring it to apprehend or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire;
it is not the hammering and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
and fitting of the wheels of a
watch; which can make it apprehend
the end for which it serves, or compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
the motion of the sun which it is
made to measure, nor is it materiall
whether we take an example in things
naturall or artificiall, or upon what
principles of mixture we proceed, the
conclusion will be still the same; for
sence and perception, and apprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and desire, &amp;c. they are as great
strangers to the obscure notions of
heat and cold, and moisture, and
drought, and of those elements to
which they are assigned, to fire, and air,
and earth, and water, as they are to
quantity, and scituation, and figure,
and motion, and the like, there is no
man certainly that can clearly appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend,
that combining any proportion
of fire, and air, and water, and earth,
should make the lump of it to know
or comprehend what is done to it or
by it: we see not then any the least
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:115953:30"/>
inducement in our notion of bodies
simple or mixed, or howsoever varied
to bring us to an apprehension of cogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>
               <p>Nor yet will our reflection upon our
cogitation bring us to any apprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of corporeity or divisibility: the
truth is our sense and apprehension of
bodies cannot infallibly assure us that
there are any bodies in the world;
but we must be forced to an higher
principle, whereon to ground that as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance,
so farre is cogitation, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension,
and the like, from invol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
in its being any corporeity; nay,
we see manifestly, that upon the divisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the body the soul remains entire,
and undevided: it is not the losse of
an hand, or foot, or eye, that can maim
the understanding or the will, or cut
off the affections: so that we have not
any the least inducement under the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of cogitation to involve division,
or under the subject of cogitation to
include the subject of division or divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibility,
to come then to a conclusion:
it doth evidently appear that corporeity
consists in divisibility, and that the es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:115953:30"/>
of the soul consists in being a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scious
essence, or a cogitative being,
to be cogitative is farre different from
being divisible or extended: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the essence of the soul is far diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
from the essence of a body:

               <p>And first of all from the very
way of our apprehensions in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall,
from our apprehensions even
of sensible objects, for however we are
apt to imagine that those may be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
by bodies, upon an exact scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiny
we shall finde it otherwise: That
this may appear we shall do well to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
and take off an errour, which
even from our childehood we have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
in: it is a common beleef of ours,
that sence is performed in the outward
organs, touching, for example in the
hand, seeing in the eye, and so of the
rest: (In them, I say, and not only by
them) and then we put our selves to
no further trouble, for to know how
sence is made, then only to thinke
that something hot toucheth the hand,
and so the hand feels heat, that the i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:115953:31"/>
of some body appears in the eye,
and so the eye sees the body; briefly,
that sence is performed either by an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
contact, as in touching and
tasting, or by a resemblance, which
by the object is wrought in the organ,
and that in the matter of sensible per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
there is no exceeding the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of these two bodies, the object, and
the organ; nor any superiour operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to that which may be performed
by the application of severall bodies:
but to take off this imposture of the
sences, I shall need to doe no more,
but to demonstrate that all our sense is
immediatly performed in the brain,
and not in the limbs or organs: We
will instance only in the sences of feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and sight.</p>
               <p>And first that our feeling is perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the brain by the mediation of
the nerves it is made manifest by our
observation of such diseases as take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
the sense of feeling, how that
the seat of those diseases, it is not in
the limbs but in the head, Palseys,
Epilepsies, Apoplexes, and the rest:
the seat of them is in those parts
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:115953:32"/>
of the brain from whence doe spring
those nerves by which our operations
are performed, and the way or reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
for restitution of our feeling, it is to
take away those obstructions from the
brain, whereupon the effect doth fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low;
now all this were needlesse, if
sence were performed immediatly in the
limbs themselves: Indeed it may possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
be imagined, that in those cases
we are therefore deprived of sence, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
our motion is intercepted, that
there is some activity towards sence de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending
upon the motion of the limbs:
although there be no visible strength
in this objection, yet there are suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
instances to take it off, seeing there
either are or lately were examples li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
of such as had no sense at all of
feeling, and yet performed their locall
motions perfectly. Moreover many un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>questionable
experiments have been
made of such as have affirmed that
they have felt in such a finger, and
such a toe, and after their hands or their
legs have been cut off. Many other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
and arguments may be brought
to prove, that the sense of feeling is not
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:115953:32"/>
performed in the outward limbs.</p>
               <p>And secondly, for the sense of see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that that likewse is not performed
in the eye, it is as evident, the cause
why it would seem to be so, is because
it is very evident that the images of
things do indeed passe thither, and are
conveighed after diverse refractions and
reflexions through the coats and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours
of the eye, to the bottome of
that tunicle which is called <hi>retiformis.</hi>
Hence it is obvious to conclude that vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
is therefore performed within the
eye. But if this were so, beside that no
reason could be given why with both
our eyes and two images of it, we see
but one thing: it would necessarily
follow that we could not see any quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
bigger then our eye in its naturall
scituation, for if Images were seen in
the eye, they would be seen as they are
in the eye, but in the bottom of the eye
the images of things are inverted, and
consequently the things themselves
would seem to be inverted, men would
seem to us with their heads below and
their feet above, that which is on the
right hand would seem to be on the left.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="48" facs="tcp:115953:33"/>Now that the Images are there in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted,
besides the demonstrative rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
that so it must be, we may at any
time make experiments to attest to
those demonstrations. It is impossible
but that the visuall beams of larger ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
must intersect each other in the
eye, and by that cutting one the other,
the scituation of the parts must be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted,
and thus much hath ever been
apprehended, and confest by all those
that have understood the laws of radi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation,
but some conceiving that by an
inverted species an object could not be
seen upright, have with mighty indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry
devised most ingenious errours
concerning waies of refraction, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
the coats and humours of the eye
should come to reerect the image be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it comes to the nerve, whereby
vision is performed, but time and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
have evicted all those witty
speculations to have been nothing but
snbtile and fine impostures of the fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
of their authours, aery reasons of
a vain and ungrounded supposition:
for it is evident to him that will take
the pains to take off all the muscles
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:115953:33"/>
and tunicles, which serve for the feed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and motion of the eye, and clear
that part only where the visuall nerve
is fastened, then darkening a room, and
only leaving an hole sufficient to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
this eye, and will stand behinde it,
and look through it; to such an one it
will be evident, that the images of
things without are inverted in the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome
of the eye, at the place where is
the passage of the visuall nerve, and
consequently as feeling was not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
in the hand, so neither is see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the eye, but both of them in
the brain. But before things are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veighed
to the brain all the corporall
similitude will quite be marred, the
image of a man cannot be carried
whole, through the optive nerve into
the hollow of the brain, nor the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure,
or other quality of that we touch
be carried quite along the nerves, from
the fingers ends unto the head, and ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall
of the nerves: but all that can be
imagined to be done in the brain, it is
some motion and alteration made ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by a vellification of the nerves, or
by a vaporous and spirituous substance,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:115953:34"/>
passing through them which retains no sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nature
or naturall sculpture of those
things which are apprehended by them;
all that is done by the bodies, the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
and the subject it is utterly of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
kinde: there is no naturall simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
betwixt a motion in the forepart
of the head, and betwixt an horse
which it represents, our apprehensions
of things they are farre beyond those
means by which they are occasioned,
and consequently the subjects of these
apprehensions do far exceed the subjects
of those poor and grosse productions,
that is, the nature of souls is far other
and better then that of bodies, which
was to be demonstrated.</p>

               <p>First of all from simple apprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
which is the first operation of the

and time, and is the taking in of sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple

it with materials for judgement
and discourse; we shall finde then the
souls incorporeity if we shall but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect
upon such simple Ideas in it self
which represent things in themselves
incorporeall, for a corporeall thing
can neither be the Idea of an incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reall
being, neither can an incorpore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,
immateriall be subjected in a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriall
or corporeall: we found be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
that the application of bodies
could not perform that which we call
the sense of bodies, much lesse then
can that produce in us Ideas incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reall,
yet such and very many such we
finde to be within our souls.</p>
               <p>We finde in our selves Ideas of spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall
substances, as of God and Angels
and of their simple and incorporeall
properties and attributes, it is but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning
back and recalling into our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrances
those demonstrations of
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:115953:35"/>
the severall Attributes of the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head,
to which we did arise, even from
the visible things of this world, and
they will satisfie us in this particular:
our endeavour there was to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate
the truth of them in themselves,
here to consider the way and manner
of their objective existence in our ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensions,
and the truth of demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration
which satisfies the souls of
men: it is that clear agreement be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
the understanding and the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
that is, that things be in the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
as they are in themselves.
We clearly then demonstrated God to
be an immateriall substance, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we gained an apprehension of a
substance immateriall and incorporeall,
and of immateriall properties, and
consequently the notions of the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head,
and his attributes were in our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandings
incorporeally, and so they
are incorporeall.</p>
               <p>It cannot here be denied but that in
our ordinary and transient thoughts
and discourses, we are very apt toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with spirituall beings to draw in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
our fancies the images of things cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreall;
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:115953:36"/>
for example, when we speak
of God we are very apt to have in our
fancies the visible heavens, and a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentation
of something sitting or
acting in them: when we think or
speak of Angels we are apt to call to
our remembrances the shapes of beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull
winged, aery bodies, and so
when we meditate upon Eternity, we
are apt to reflect upon the image of
time, of the revolution of the Sun and
Starres, which are the usuall measures
of it, at leastwise of a successive dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of things, and there are diverse
of us which terminate our thoughts in
these images, and never obtain a flight
beyond them, nor ever come to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
in our souls the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
imagination and intellectuall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension;
but yet notwithstanding
when we have the patience to stay up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the consideration of these objects,
and warily attend to that inward light
which we bear about us, we presently
reject these images from the essence of
God, and Angels, and Eternity, and
by discourse we strip off these materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
and grosse representations, and
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:115953:36"/>
finde that the causes why upon such
occasions as these they come into our
mindes, is, because we commonly hear
of them together, and because of those
symbolicall expressions of these beings
which have delivered to us the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of these. God Almighty cals
himself the ancient of daies, and it is
not our custome to imagine any thing
but cloathed with circumstances, in
some place, and the place that is usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
mentioned with God, it is the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens,
and those heavens which are the
object of our senses and imagination,
it is the place of the Sunne, and Moon,
and Starres; and so we are apt to form
to our selves an image of God, or at
least through incogitancy to let slip in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
our thoughts a fancy of some reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend
image sitting above the Firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>Thus likewise the descriptions of the
Angels, they are usually made to us
in Scriptures by such representations:
we see nothing fairer then our own
kinde, and so we conceive of them in
the fairest shapes we can imagine, (and
contrariwise of the devils in the most
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:115953:37"/>
ugly) assigning to them wings, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
under such forms the notion of
of them is veiled to us.</p>
               <p>And yet at the same time we know,
and can perhaps demonstrate evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that if God were a body, he could
not be a God, that is, that the proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of a bodily substance can no way
agree with that notion of the God-head,
which is immoveably fastened
in the very essence of our souls.</p>
               <p>We know habitually that the nature
and essense of the Angels that stood,
it is the same with those that fell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way;
however we have fair and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant
imaginations usually when we
speak of those of light; and foul, and
ugly, when we think of those that are
in chains of utter darknesse: however
the name of <hi>Michael</hi> and his Arch-An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
recall into our mindes the images
of the fairest of the children of men, and
that of <hi>Beelzebub</hi> the Image of a Dragon.</p>
               <p>So likewise the common measure of
the duration of things, wherewith we
usually converse, they are hours and
daies, and moneths, and years, and
these are made by the revolution of the
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:115953:37"/>
sun, and of the starres, and those are
attended with severall positions of
them in respect of themselves, and us
with light and darkness, cold and heat,
Winter and Summer, and those other
vicissitudes, and speaking of Eternity
we presently think of a long continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
and so call into our imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a long continued series of these re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volutions
and vicissitudes; whereas yet
we know that where there is a vicissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
there is a priority, and where
there is a priority there must be a
beginning, and where there was a
beginning that was not eternall:
'tis plain that if in eternity there
were such parts as daies and years,
there must be as many millions of
years, as minutes, and so that a
minute were equall really to a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
years, and so it follows clearly
that Eternity even in our notion is an
infinite and undivided unsuccessive du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>
               <p>These examples are sufficient to
shew the difference betwixt the intelle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall
apprehension of things, and
the imagination which accompanies
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:115953:38"/>
our superficiall thoughts, our slight
and cursory taking them to our mindes
and to illustrate that, however in our
fancies we may have corporeall repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentations,
attending upon these spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
beings, yet the Idea's whereby the
understanding apprehends those simple
essences, are incorporeall, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
the understanding part of
man is incorporeall.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>ANd now whatsoever of perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
may be evinced to be in the
souls of men, from the simple appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensions
of single objects, may much
more strongly be concluded from those
more perfect operations, exercised in
comparing severall things together,
and working out the truths, striking
forth the light from those collisions.
A judgement takes in two severall sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:115953:38"/>
terms, and upon them passeth the
sentence of their agreement or disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement.</p>
               <p>A discourse takes into consideration
two of the judgements already past
and decided by the soul, and from
those two draws forth a third, and so
brings into act those truths which fold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in their causes lie in the secret pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of the soule concealed from it
self.</p>
               <p>Now as the souls of men are consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
to themselves of certain essences
within themselves, which neither in
their being nor in their operation upon
the soul are any way mixed with ought
that is corporeall; and so from thence
the incorporeity of the soul was imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly
concluded, so here in these se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
and third operations of the soul,
we have this further advantage, that
however the simple objects which are
the terms in the matters of judgement
may be bodies, yet the acts of judging
and discerning and reasoning, they are
no bodily acts, nor come within the
compasse of bodily motions to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed,
and that even in those things
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:115953:39"/>
which are most obvious to the outward
sences or the inward, the understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
part is yet carried away farre be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
the bounds and territories of
the sences, and raises it self into the
contemplation of causes of the things
it either sees or hears, or otherwise
perceives and frames to it self conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences
and corrolaries, such as are
not sensible but are only discoverable
by a diviner light, by this diviner fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
it is that seizing upon any thing
whatsoever, and fixing it self steddily
upon the contemplation of it, it pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
from the most contemptible of
creatures up to the incomprehensible
creator, it climbs up by degrees, and
passing through the continued chain of
causes till it comes to that link which
is fastened to the chair of God, it rests
not in things below, but soars up sted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
to immensity and eternity. It is by
this faculty, that upon sight of the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
of things, it doth foresee the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
and consequences: and seeing the
effects it makes to it self a conclusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of what must be the causes, and by
frequent exercise in these contemplati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:115953:39"/>
attains to a kinde of mastery over
the works of nature, and produceth
things strange and wonderfull in ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
it applies the active powers un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the passive (as the Schoolmen speak)
and so imitates God and nature in
great and marvellous conclusions.</p>
               <p>He observes the properties of a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spicable

in the contemplation of the consequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of those properties that he dares
adventure himself vpon the huge unru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ocean, under the conduct and dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of it, and he findes experience
to answer to his contemplation, he
gets the mastery of that unruly boiste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
element: he rides securely upon
the back of the dark waters: he makes
a needle touched with a stone to supply
the place of the stars of heaven: when
the eyes of heaven are veiled from him
amidst the darke waters and thicke
clouds of the skey; he examines all
the chambers of the sun, and imitates
him in compassing the world, he goes
out from the East, and returns again
from the West; returns, and that load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
with the treasures of the world,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:115953:40"/>
with the blessings which <hi>Moses</hi> did assign
to <hi>Joseph,</hi> Deu. 33.13. the precious things
of heaven for the dew, and for the
deep, that coucheth beneath, the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
fruits brought forth by the Sun,
and the precious things put forth by
the Moon, the chief things of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
mountains, and the precious
things of the lasting hils, the precious
things of the earth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> he settles a
correspondency betwixt the utmost di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants
of the world, and opens a traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fique
betwixt nations opposite in place,
in manners and affections, such as had
lien concealed from the knowledge
of one another, even almost from the
time of the Ark that floted upon the
waters, but what do I speak of these
things? he displays the banner of
Christ in the regions of death and hell;
he sheds forth the glorious light of the
Gospel to the people that sate in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
and in the shadow of death: what
sensible analogy or correspondency is
there betwixt the scituation or motion
of a stone, and the salvation of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde,
and yet by various consequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
he discovers how by the means of
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:115953:40"/>
that, this likewise may be effected; he
discovers it, and puts it in a successefull
and happy execution.</p>
               <p>What is there more contemptible
then a stone? hardly any thing that is
a substance, and yet it is much lesse con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible
then a shadow, he observes
a shadow, and that carries him aloft
to a contemplation, and a discovery
of that most glorious creature which
comes forth as a Bridegroom out of
his Chamber, and rejoyceth as a Giant
to runne his course: From the shadow
he riseth to the Sunne in the Firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and to a perfect understanding
of his course in the Ecliptique, and
then brings back again his understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the shadow, he makes thereby
an instrument that shall designe to the
eye the daily circuits of its motion:
his eye that gave occasion to his minde
to discover them in contemplation,
and now his minde is impregnated
with the light of knowledge, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns
with usury to the senses that oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casionall
advantage which they affor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
it, and gives them the pleasure of
the viewing of its practise it gives the
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:115953:41"/>
eye and hand directions for drawing of
lines, which by the regular applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of a stick, or wire, stone, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
body shall discover not only the
divisions of the day, the hours that
are past, or else to come, but even all
the mysteries of the Sunnes motion:
how it measures out the night, and in
what quantity it dispences out the
day: how near are his approaches at
noon, and how farre distant he is from
us at midnight; by what degrees he
draws towards us, and how by eqnall
measures he retreats; how he riseth
from his greatest southern declination
to the North, and from thence returns
again to his chambers in the South, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
touched the boundaries that he
cannot, he must not passe; and how in
this his continuall progresse he dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
the severall seasons of the year,
what time he enters into every sign,
when he beginnes to rejoyce the hearts
of any of the nations by his presence,
and what time he leaves them in the
darknesse: these are but some few and
lesse considerable of those wonders
which are performed by that which
hath no being.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="65" facs="tcp:115953:41"/>To insist upon it how the reason and
wit of man hath found out severall
Arts and Sciences, from principles most
contemptible, how it ariseth to most
admirable speculations, and upon poor
beginnings to what issues it brings;
how it can give the height or distance
to which it never can approach, how by
the application of a piece of wood or
other matter to the eye, it can assigne
the distances and places and motions,
and appearances of the starres of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
and foretell the positions and
combinations of the Planets, the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clipses

               </argument>
               <p>THe third thing which I propound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to speak of by way of prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to the entertainment of the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
of our Religion, it was the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of the holy Scriptures, that
which we have already demonstrated
was of a more generall designe, this
comes to be more particular, that
was against Atheisme and irreligion,
this against superstition, and the false
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:115953:43"/>
religions of the world, the will-wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships
of the Heathen and the Jews, and
of a party of those that do professe the
name of Christ. Out of what hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
been delivered, a necessity of
Religion in the generall will result,
for it is the first consequence of reason
from the consideration of the attributes
of God, and the condition and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties
of the souls of men, for having
by necessary force of argument drawn
up the vast number of mankinde to one
originall cause, even to God as their
Creatour, we cannot chuse if we will
insist upon that consideration but fall
upon a necessity of Religion. For if
God have created man he must have
done it for some end and purpose, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
he is an intelligent agent, and such
agents as work with understanding,
they alwaies work upon designe, and
propound some good to themselves in
all their actions, for they cannot be
supposed to work but upon desire, and
the object of desire is only goodnesse;
if now we employ all our wit and our
invention to discover what good can
accrue to the God-head by the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:115953:43"/>
of man, we can finde none that is
imaginable in the way of profit or of
gain: that which the Psalmist hath
layed down is a conclusion following
from the light of reason as well as
from the speciall revelations of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Scripture <hi>that our goodnesse extendeth
not to God,</hi> and it was a question, which
might with good congruity fall from
<hi>Eliphaz</hi> the <hi>Temanite,</hi> Job 22. 1. Can a
man be profitable to God, as he that is
wise may be profitable to himself? Is
it any pleasure to the Almighty that
thou art righteous? or is it any gaine
to him that thou makest thy way per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect?
And the matter of gain being
excluded from the end of God in our
creation, if we runne over all the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
of pleasure which come within
the spheres of the souls of men, we
shall finde no pretence of reason for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thing of ours to please the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and so to be assigned as an intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible
cause of our creation, but the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
which the God-head might take
in the communication of his goodnes,
in the explication or unfolding of those
glories which lay enwrapped within it
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:115953:44"/>
self, in having something (if I may
so speak) without and besides it self,
which might be apprehensive of the
excellencies of it, might be subject and
conformed, and might perform to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
it the acts of glorification and
praise.</p>
               <p>So then the glorifying of God is all
the end that can be found out why God
should ever have created us: and the
next thought to this conclusion of our
reason must be of the waies and means
whereby he may be glorified by us:
and there again when we shall have run
over all the waies imaginable, we can
fasten upon none other then the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration
of his excellency, the adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his Majesty, the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to his will. And these are the
acts and performances of Religion,
so that the consideration of the God-head
and his Attributes, doe natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
cast us upon a necessity of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</p>
               <p>Now as the consideration of the
God-head doth naturally enforce a
Necessity of Religion, so doth likewise
the consideration of the Immortality
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:115953:44"/>
of the souls of men: for if we shall
but consider, that our souls shall never
fail of their existence, but continue in
being to all Eternity, we can hardly
avoid the thoughts of the shortnesse of
our duration in this world, or the
comparison of the time of our durati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
here, with that other continuance
which doth abide for us hereafter: and
if we will have the patience in our
thoughts to insist upon the proportion
of a few years unto an unlimited, and
unmeasurable Eternity, we shall una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidably
fall upon this judgement, that
our condition here is no way compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
to that which shall be: that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentany
pleasure bears no proportion
to eternall happinesse or eternall mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry:
that these <hi>light afflictions which are
but for a moment, are not to be compared either
to the joys or miseries which are to be expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi>
and consequently that our care for
this life ought not, nor cannot in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
prudence equall our care for eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.
So then whatsoever befals us here
we shall conclude it requisite to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
that we be not miserable hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:115953:45"/>
and consequently that we make
our selves a friend of him that hath
the issues of death in his power, and
moderates and dispenses the rewards
of Eternity: but there is no way to
have him propitious to us, but by obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
no reason to expect that he
should satisfie our longing, or fulfill
our will to all Eternity, unlesse we
fulfill his will for our time of triall in
this life, and that is by the exercise of
Religion only attainable. So that the
consideration of the Souls Immortality
will likewise enforce us to a necessity of
Religion.</p>
               <p>Thus farre the common principles of
naturall reason will force us, even the
first and most common principles of
intelligence, such as are grounds of
clear, evident, and perfect demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
so that it must be the Fool alone,
as the Psalmist speaks, which can be an
Atheist, so that they are without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse
whoever glorifie him not as God:
thus farre those poor remains of sight
which yet is left to the corrupted off-spring
of our degenerate Parent will
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:115953:45"/>
serve to leade us, to the generall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
of Religion: but here indeed it
Jeaves us destitute of the certain waies
of pleasing God: and consequently
destitute of clear and solid grounds of
hope of attaining to eternall happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.
And here it is that the Scoffers
and irreligious men take occasion
to reason themselves and others to
destruction: seeing that nature hath
here deserted us, and left us no
infallible Rules of particular waies
of devotion, they contend that
ther are none such, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
that our Religion is vain
and uncertain, uncertain in the

and principles. And here now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst

such time as our wils are guilty of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ormous
sinnes.) A fancy that is the
mother of diverse prodigies lately bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
into the Church, as that either
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:115953:48"/>
God sees no sinne in beleevers, that
Murther, Adultery, Incest, Sacrilege,
(any thing) may be committed, and
that these are no sinnes in beleevers,
arguing thus, that they which have the
holy Spirit are free from sinne, such as
do beleeve the Gospel they have the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Spirit, because there is no other mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
sufficient besides a private illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
so then they cannot be guilty
of sinne, but yet they may, and doe
commit such things as those we men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned;
wherefore those are no sinnes.
Thus doth Satan transform himself in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
an Angel of light, and act his Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedies
in the likenesse of the holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit:
Nay we say, and doe beleeve that
the Devils <hi>also beleeve and tremble,</hi> that
the Kingdome of Heaven is like a Net
which drew to shore fishes of all sorts,
some to be put into vessels, and others
to be thrown away. We say and doe
acknowledge to the glory of God, that
the internall light of the holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures
is sufficient to make the man of
God perfect to salvation, and that in
some it is the means of generating faith
in men, but that the most of those be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:115953:48"/>
who have the happinesse to be
trained up from their infancy in any
part of the Christian Church; by ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving
the esteem which in their
Church is had of those holy Bookes,
they doe betimes upon the reputation
of their Church receive them with a
kinde of veneration, that upon this
motive they receive the faith; and that
others doe upon other inducements en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain
it, and once for all we say,
that besides the secret and free illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations
of the holy Spirit, these want
not Arguments to enforce the reason
of unbvassed men to entertain the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
as the Word of God, and that all
such as without the engagement of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse
affections shall admit those Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
in their apprehensions must ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily
be of that belief.</p>
               <p>Before I betake my self to the proof
of this assertion, I must premise that
by the books of the holy Scripture, I
mean such books of the old and new
Testament as in the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
have been accounted Canonicall,
and that I intend not here to take up
the controversie which is betwixt the
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:115953:49"/>
Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and us concerning
the books which are Apocryphall, the
drift of my discourse being against
those who beleeve too little, and not
those who beleeve too much.</p>
               <p>Secondly, I must premise that we
are not here to expect the necessity of
demonstrations, but must content our
selves with such arguments as the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of our subject will admit: there
can be no true and perfect demonstrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
unlesse the property to be demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated
do naturally flow from the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of the demonstration. In matters
then depending upon the free election
of causes there cannot possibly be any
perfect demonstration, and such is the
giving of a rule of life in respect of
God, so that there cannot be a perfect
demonstration of it. So then we must
content our selves with arguments fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
short of the necessity of demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration,
but such as no man shall be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to deny, without denying some such
principles as all men doe acknowledge
to be true.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>The Assertion resolved into
two Propositions, the
former undertaken, that
whosoever beleeves the
Historicall part of the
Scripture must beleeve
the Doctrinall.</p>
               </argument>
               <list>
                  <item>1. TO beleeve that these Books of
Scripture are the Word of God,
there are very great and important rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.</item>
                  <item>2. To disbeleeve it there are no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
or not any sufficient reasons.</item>
               </list>
               <p>And first of all, to prove that those
bookes of Scriptures are the Word of
God, it is sufficient if we prove the
truth of them, because themselves pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to be of divine inspiration. All
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:115953:50"/>
Scripture is of divine inspiration, the
tenor of the Old Testament runnes ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
so, The Lord spake unto <hi>Moses</hi>
or other of the Prophets, such as were
the Penmen of the holy Scripture, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
the generall pretence of those that
wrote both Testaments, is, that holy
men did speak and write, as they were
inspired by the holy Ghost, so then, if
this pretence of it be true, it must be
true, that it proceeded from the holy
Ghost, and consequently to prove the
truth of it will conclude that it is the
Word of God.</p>
               <p>Now as concerning the truch of those
writings we have 1. The same Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
or as great as for the truth of
any writings in the world. Nay 2. We
have Arguments (morall Arguments)
to evince the truth of them, such as no
other writings can pretend to. That we
may shorten that we have to perform,
you may consider that the things deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
to us in the holy Scriptures are
either matters of History or Doctrine,
and that these are frequently interwo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
in the Scripture, so as when Saint
<hi>Matthew</hi> doth in an historicall narration
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:115953:50"/>
bring in our Saviour preaching in the
Mount, and delivering there a summa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of his Doctrine, so that it will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
that if the historicall part of the
Scripture be undoubtedly true there
cannot rationally be any doubt made
of those doctrinall rules and precepts
which there are delivered. As for the
doctrine of any party whatsoever con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
God there is not imaginable a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
argument so ready to evince the
truth of it as God himself, freely at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testing
to the deliverers of it by migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
signes and wonders, by great and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniable
miracles, such as are instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of the immediate hand of God;
such as by skillfull and knowing men
are acknowledged to be no way per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable
by the praestigatory act of
Magicians, or by the power of evill spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits.
Such were the miracles which are
delivered to us by <hi>Moses</hi> all along the
course of Gods bringing the children
of <hi>Israel</hi> out of <hi>Egipt</hi> to his own land;
and afterwards wrought by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets.
And such were the works of our
blessed Saviour all along the course of
his Ministry before his passion, and
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:115953:51"/>
such and more admirable was his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection
and ascention. Whosoever
doth beleeve, that there was such a <hi>man</hi>
as <hi>Moses,</hi> that this man <hi>Moses</hi> did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse
himself to have received from
God a Law, which was to be delivered
to a people, he may hitherto very well
doubt, whether or no he was not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,
in imagining that he had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
such a law. But if withall he shall
be assured or stedfastly beleeve, that this
man <hi>Moses,</hi> to make good his pretences
to Gods revelations, could obtain so
much of God as, to the eyes and sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
of millions of gainsayers and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posers
of what he did deliver, to shew
great and palpable miracles: whoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
doth beleeve that he did turn a
rod into a serpent, and that back again
into a rod; that by stretching forth that
rod upon the River <hi>Nilus</hi> he turned
their waters into bloud, and slew their
fish: how afterwards he brought frogs
upon all the land of <hi>Egipt,</hi> even into
their Kings chambers; how he brought
flies, and caterpillars, and lice, and
thunder, and lightning, and mighty
hail-stones; how he brought botches
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:115953:51"/>
and murrain amongst men and cattell;
how he brought upon all the land of
<hi>Egypt</hi> a darknesse that might be felt, and
slew their first-born; afterwards how
he divided the Red Sea for the people
to passe through it, and when he had
served the turn of his party, how the
flouds returned and overwhelmed his
enemies; he that shall beleeve that after
this he brought water out of the rock,
sweetned the waters of <hi>Marah,</hi> brought
Quails into the wildernesse, procured
Manna to fall about their tents all the
week, and none upon the Sabbath; how
the fire from Heaven consumed <hi>Nadab</hi>
and <hi>Abihu,</hi> only for adventuring to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
strange fire, otherwise then he had
prescribed them; that the earth open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and swallowed up <hi>Korah,</hi> and cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Congregation of <hi>Abiram;</hi> that
at the time of the promulgation of his
Laws, God himself appeared visibly,
that the glory of his presence oversha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed
the Mount, how there were
thunder and lightnings, and a thick
cloud upon the Mount, <hi>Exo.</hi> 19. how
Mount <hi>Sinai</hi> was altogether on a
smoak, because the Lord descended
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:115953:52"/>
upon it in fire, and the smoak thereof
ascended as the smoak of a furnace, and
the whole mountain shaked exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
Whosoever beleeves these works
to have been done by the same party
that professed a revelation from God,
cannot avoid the beleif of his professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
unles he can beleeve that God by so
great miracles would attest to Blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy
and Sacrilegious impostures,
a thing which is palpably mad to be
beleeved, and is against the light of
common sense and reason.</p>
               <p>So likewise whosoever doth beleeve
that in the daies of <hi>Augustus Caesar</hi> there
was such a man as <hi>Jesus of Nazareth,</hi>
commonly called Christ, and that this
man did professe himself the sonne of
God, and pretended to deliver to all
the world a way of Religion, a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
of life eternall, an abrogation
of the ceremonies of the former law,
and those other things which he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed,
there is no necessity that he
should beleeve that either he was the
Son of God, or that his doctrine was
infallible. But if together with these
professions he shall take into beleif
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:115953:52"/>
those things which Jesus did, though
for his owne sake he see no reason to
beleeve him, yet at least he will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve
for the works sake, if he shall
beleeve that God himself did attest
to these professions, he will likewise be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve
those professions of his to have
been true, and Gods attestation he will
beleeve, if he shall beleeve that a little
before his birth a company of Angels
appeared to Shepherds and told them
of it; that presently after it a starre
appeared to wise men in the East, and
conducted them to the place of his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity:
that in his life time he did such
works as never man did: how he turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
water into wine, commanded the
windes and the sea: how he cured all
manner of diseases with his Word, how
he gave sight to such as were born
blinde<gap reason="illegible: broken type" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> which was never known since
the world began, how he cured most
obstinate diseases of long continuance
meerly by the touching of his gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
how he cast out devils from
such as were possessed: how he raised
up the dead to life, and every way de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrated
the power and presence of
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:115953:53"/>
the God-head, how at the time of his
crucifixion the frame of Nature seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to be dissolved; how the vail of the
Temple rent, and the graves opened,
and many bodies of the dead, which
slept, arose, and came into the holy city,
and appeared to many; how there was
darknesse over all the earth, the Sunne
eclipsed at the time of the Jewish passe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over,
when the Moon was at the full;
and lastly how after three daies he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rose
again, appeared severall times to
his Apostles, gave them power to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
the miracles which he had done,
and visibly ascended up into heaven:
Whosoever doth beleeve these matters
of fact, must of necessity beleeve the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
which he beleeved; unlesse he
will accuse God of bearing false wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
or own some such other detesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and odious incongruity.</p>
               <p>You see then, how the matters of
fact being cleared, and the historicall
narrations being asserted to be true, the
doctrinall parts will follow of their
owne accord: and that if we can clear
such things to have been performed by
<hi>Moses,</hi> and <hi>Jesus of Nazareth,</hi> and that
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:115953:53"/>
such doctrines were delivered by them;
it follows that those doctrines are true,
and are the Word of God.</p>

taken from the thing it self that is deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered,
or from the persons which have
delivered the relation, and from such
qualifications of them as upon the
grounds of reason he can discover, if
the matter it self doe involve a clear
and evident contradiction to some na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
principles, it is not the assevera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of all the men of the world that
can work a beleif in the understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
it not being in the power of man
to entertain a beleif contrary to his

have not suffered any fallacy to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed

runne over the matter again unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,

in reference to his principles.</p>
               <p>But if the thing it self be not incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible,
however difficult or strange it
be, that which then he doth consider
is, the qualities of the relators, and the

               <p>Men usually consider whether or no
the things be such as may be certainly
and evidently known, and whether
these parties had sufficient means to
come to the certain knowledge of
them, and whether they contain them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
in their relations within the
bounds of things liable to certain
knowledge: thus then those things
which may be certainly known they
are the outward events of things,
whereas the secret causes may lie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed,
the former are such as are the
objects of common sence, and come
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:115953:55"/>
within the cognizance of all: the later
are such as are indiscoverable by any
man, they being oftentimes made up
of a complexion of actions and dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions
of multitudes of men; or things
perfectly to be known, onely of him
that sees all things <hi>in speculo aeterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If the History (or Relation) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
it selfe within the bounds of evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
and certainty, the next thing to
be considered is, whether or no the
party that is Author of the Relation
had sufficient meanes of knowledge;
whether himself were an eye or eare-witnesse
of the things which he relates;
or whether the things were so publike<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
acted and knowne, that he might
certainely, and particularly informe
himselfe, without any danger of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit.</p>
               <p>If the party be of known ability,
both in himself, and in reference to the
things, the next question will be of his
Integrity, and whether there be suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
reason to beleeve, that he would
not voluntarily deliver a falshood, in
stead of truth, and because it is not
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:115953:55"/>
reason to beleeve that men will lye, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
they either be known to be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
or some end be visible of gain to
them from their lying. Men use to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
these things likewise before they
settle upon beleef.</p>
               <p>These are the grounds and conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations,
and inward discourses where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
men doe proceed to the receiving
of historicall beleef, even of any rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
whatsoever: and accordingly as
all of these conditions be clear or ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure,
doubtfull or certain, such is the
strength of his belief; if all of them
concurre there remains no reason at
all of doubting: if some of them fail,
there will follow a debility, answerable
in the belief; seeing that the belief of the
conclusion can never exceed the force
and evidence of the premisses.</p>
               <p>That there is or lately hath been
such a City as <hi>Rome,</hi> or <hi>Hierusalem,</hi> or
<hi>Paris,</hi> there are none of us that doubt,
although we have not seen them; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they are things very easily known,
as being the objects of the eyes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the reporters have been there to
see them, and because no end or rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:115953:56"/>
can be imagined why or how men
should combine to abuse those that have
not travelled.</p>
               <p>That there have been formerly such
Cities as <hi>Corinth,</hi> and <hi>Philippi,</hi> and <hi>Lace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demon,</hi>
&amp;c. we make even as little doubt
as of the former, because the things in
their nature are evidently to be known,
and they have all of them been men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
in the Books of <hi>Polybius</hi> or <hi>Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarch,</hi>
or a multitude of Historians that
knew them.</p>
               <p>That the History of <hi>Caesars</hi> warre a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the <hi>Gaules</hi> is true, though written
by himself, it is beleeved, because of his
abilities to know, and because it makes
not things appear to be strained in his
behalf, because it might have been
contradicted if it had been otherwise,
and because he is delivered to us in the
complexion of Histories as a man of
honour that would not write a
lye.</p>
               <p>That the Histories of <hi>Salust</hi> are true,
it is beleeved because he wrote of
things done within the compasse of his
time whereof he might well informe
himself, he was a man of knowledge
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:115953:56"/>
and could not gain by any thing that
he hath delivered if it were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>true.</p>
               <p>That all of these Histories were
written by those that bear the name of
them, there is hardly any man that
doubts, because there is no improba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
in reason: they have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly
so received in the world, and
mentioned successively in Authors fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
one another from their severall
generations down to ours.</p>
               <p>We see the various degrees of qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications
(some of them) upon
which we build an historicall beleif,
that this beleif comes short of the clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of our assent to a Mathematicall
demonstration is evident, because there
is an absolute impossibility that things
should be otherwise, there being a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction
involved in the very tearms,
and <hi>in adjecto:</hi> but here is no impossibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
but only an exceeding difficulty
which makes up (not indeed a Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticall
but) a morall impossibility;
it is possible that all men may combine
together to say that they have seen such
things as they have not seen, because e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:115953:57"/>
man is a lyar: but how they should
come to doe it, or to what end is so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visible
and inconceivable, that the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
taken in the grosse, is altogether in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible.
It is absolutely possibly that
all those writings which we receive as
delivered down from ancient times, may
have been of late devised by some men
to abuse the world, rnd put upon other
names: but to what end, any men should
ttke the pains, and how they should fit
them with circumstances, and make
them all depend upon each other, in a
constant succession, agreeing in the men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of persons, places, and actions, is a
thing so difficult, as that it would argue
madnesse to beleeve, and conclude him
to want the use of reason, that should
reject the light of all antiquity.</p>

               <p>SUch madnesse then, and no lesse it

no lesse madnesse? nay,
it is much greater, and that not only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they are of more concernment to
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:115953:58"/>
us then the acts of men of former times,
but even because of the advantages of
the delivery of those Histories. We
will beginne with those of the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament.</p>
               <p>And here first, The Books of the New
Testament were written by those whose
Names they bear; that the four Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spels
were written by the four Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lists,
and that the Acts of the Apostles
were written by Saint <hi>Luke,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Now that these Books were written
by these men, it is impossible affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively
to demonstrate; all that can be
said is, that there is as great evidence of
it as of any other writing in the world;
that by whatsoever argument it can be
made appear that any Books have been
written by those who are reputed for
their Authours in antiquity, (that the
works of <hi>Homer,</hi> or <hi>Plato,</hi> or <hi>Aristotle,</hi>
or <hi>Tully</hi> are theirs) by the same it may
be made evident, that these have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
from our Authours.</p>
               <p>Have they been successively deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed?
so have these: have they been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
mentioned under those names?
so have these: have they been acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:115953:58"/>
by all parties? so have these:
those that in the primitive times did
oppose the doctrine of Christ, yet did
it not under the pretence that their
Books were spurious, neither Jews nor
Pagans had the impudence to make
that objection. <hi>Julian</hi> the Apostate
doth freely acknowledge (<hi>Cyrill.</hi> 10.
<hi>Grot.</hi> 3. <hi>ver.</hi>) that the Books which by
the Christians were received under the
names of <hi>Peter, Paul, Mathew, Marke, Luke;</hi>
they were the writings of those Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours.</p>
               <p>It is true, that there are some Book
received of the Canon of the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament,
whose Authors are unknown;
as the Epistle to the Hebrews, and some
others: but concerning them I hope to
speake in answering those objections
which are made against the Scripture.
In the mean time we may justly assume
it for granted, that those whereof no
question hath been made in ancient
times they are the writings of those to
whom they are ascribed.</p>
               <p>And now this being supposed, which
cannot with any pretence of reason be
denied, it follows clearly that the
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:115953:59"/>
things they have related are to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved:
for first, the things which they
have delivered they were matters easily
to be known; in respect of the things
themselves, they were matters of fact
and speeches performed by our Saviour
or by themselves: Secondly, the acts
were acted publiquely in the face of the
world; and the speeches which they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver
as spoken by others, they were
for the most part spoken publiquely,
either in the Synagogue, or in the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
or to the multitude somewhere ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
together, on a mountain, by
the sea-side, in publique places: so as
they might have easily been contradict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
if they should have delivered a false<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood:
Thirdly, the parties which have
delivered them had all the opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
in the world to know the truth of
things; they were things done either by
themselves, or within their owne sight,
or hearing for the greatest part; or at
least wise in the times and places where
the reporters lived.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mathew</hi> and <hi>John</hi> the two Evangelists
which wrote the History of Christ,
they were two of his Disciples: two
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:115953:59"/>
that were intimately acquainted with
his actions, and his words, more famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar
with him then the rest; the one was
the disciple that <hi>Jesus</hi> loved, and used
to lean in his bosome, as they lay at
meat; the other was usually taken with
him when most of the rest were left be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde;
and hence it follows that they
themselves were present at almost all
the acts, and speeches which they have
delivered.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Marke</hi> and <hi>Luke</hi> the other two Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelists,
they lived in the same territories,
at the same time, where and when our
blessed Saviour bestowed his conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
and moreover Saint <hi>Marke</hi> was
(as 'tis very probable) first a Disciple
of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> who was miraculously
chosen to deliver the doctrine of Christ:
Afterwards he was undoubtedly a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
and companion of Saint <hi>Peter,</hi>
who was an Apostle of our Saviour, did
live familiarly together with him, was
present at almost all things which <hi>Marke</hi>
hath written: and besides whatever is
delivered by Saint <hi>Marke</hi> is to be found
in the writings of the Apostles. <hi>Luke</hi>
was an individuall companion of <hi>Paul,</hi>
                  <pb n="102" facs="tcp:115953:60"/>
and so he might learne of him such
things as he delivered; besides that he
saith, that he spoke with those that
were eye-witnesses of the things which
he delivered, he was borne near hand,
he travelled through <hi>Palestina,</hi> might
converse with those very men, upon
whom <hi>Jesus</hi> had wrought his miracles,
such as had seen the life of <hi>Jesus,</hi> his
death and resurrection.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Acts of the Apostles</hi> were likewise
written by Saint <hi>Luke;</hi> and that Book
containes some things done by the rest
of the Apostles; but the most of it is
concerning the actions of <hi>Paul</hi> after his
miraculous conversion: the former it
was easie for him to know, either from
the Apostles themselves or others: of
the latter he could not be ignorant, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he was continually with <hi>Paul</hi> in
all his labours and his journeys, even
from the time of his conversion to his
imprisonment at <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for the matters of fact which are
delivered in the Epistles of <hi>Paul,</hi> and <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi>
and <hi>James,</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> and <hi>Jude,</hi> they
are such, as either were done by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
and so they could not possibly
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:115953:60"/>
be ignorant of them, or by others with
whom they held a correspondence, or
by our Saviour whose Apostles they
were, all but <hi>Paul;</hi> or else they are
things done by others, publiquely and
notoriously known.</p>
               <p>Lastly, As for the Epistle to the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews
and the Revelations, though the
authours of them be not certainly
known in the Church, yet thus much
is plain, that the Authour to the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews
saith, that the Gospel of Iesus was
preached at first by Christ, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
unto him (Us) by them that
heard him, 2. v. 3. and so that he could
not be ignorant of that; nor yet was
it possible that the Authour of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations
should be ignorant, whether or
no he had those visions which he hath
delivered.</p>
               <p>Now these are all the Books of the
New Testament, and it appears, that
the Authours of them had as much op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
to know the things which
they delivered as is possible to be had:
wherefore the businesse is clear in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of their Sufficiency of knowledge;
and all the Question which remains,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:115953:61"/>
it must be in regard of their <hi>Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whosoever challengeth or questions
the Integrity of an Historian, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that cause refuseth to receive his
Testimony, it is requisite that he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
the reasons of his suspition, that
he charge the Authours of corruption,
and prove the charge which he hath
objected; or that he discover and
manifest the ends, which he might
propound to himself, as the reward
of his imposture; that he shew the
gain that might accrue, or the losse,
or perill, or ignominy that he might
avoid; and manifest that his accusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
hath not proceeded from ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice,
but from judgement, from some
grounds of reason, and not from per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versenesse,
or spight, or any inhumanity.
Here then it is that we challenge men
or Devils to produce the crimes, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect
and prove the villanies of these
Writers; nay, to assign the ends which
they might have in relating falshood,
the gain, the pleasure, the glory, the
safety, or whatsoever it is that prevails
upon the appetites and lusts of men:
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:115953:61"/>
and let their infidelity and jealousie
out-doe the malice of the grand Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state.
Indeed I think scorn to stand up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this argument, it was the contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation
of these things chiefly that
gained from me that second assertion.
That there is greater reason to beleeve
the Scripture then any other writings in
the world: the first Proposition being
already demonstrated <hi>That we have as
great.</hi>

               <argument>
                  <p>That there is much great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er

History of the New

               </argument>
               <p>HAving already demonstrated, that
considering the qualifications of
the persons who have recorded unto us
the New Testament of our Saviour;
there is as great reason to give cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
to their Histories as to any other
ancient Histories in the world, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of their means of knowledge, and
opportunities for discovery of the truth
of those matters of fact, which they
have delivered. It follows now that
we make good that, which in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
place we propounded concerning
them, which was, That we have greater
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:115953:62"/>
reason to beleeve them then to beleeve
any Historians whatsoever, and this
now will be manifested to us by these
Arguments following,
<list>
                     <item>1. Greater obligation.</item>
                     <item>2. Their sufferings.</item>
                     <item>3. Their Miracles.</item>
                     <item>4. Their predictions.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>First then, They were more power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
obliged to the delivery of the
truth then others, not that others were
not obliged likewise to deliver nothing
but the truth: there is in the consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of every soul setled a principle
dictating unto him, that he ought not
not to recede from the truth in his rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
but yet this principle is, in the
most of men, very much overclouded
and overborn; as is manifest, not only
by the fabulous relations of ancient
Histories, even after the institution of
the Olympiads; but by that inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which we finde, almost in all men, to
make their relations handsome; in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
wherunto even the gravest of them,
<hi>Josephus, Livy,</hi> and the rest of those or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
of Historians, have often changed
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:115953:63"/>
the form of Circumstances, and varied
from the truth, to make a coherence
of things according to their fancy, such
as might please their owne imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
               <p>The truth is, that which held in the
Heathen, so far as they were held with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the boundaries of truth, it can be
conceived to be no other then a certain
magnanimity, and a morall generosity
that was actuated and quickned in
them by the conceit of a reputation,
thereby gained amongst the people, of
their own generation, their hopes of
perpetuating their owne fame, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with the acts which they record<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and consecrating them to eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and immortality; I do not say, that
this was all the motive which they had,
but that upon the consideration of
them, in the whole complexion of their
circumstances, I cannot finde out any
more powerfull motive, nor any stron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
obligation.</p>
               <p>But, besides all that these men had to
move them, the writers of the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament
had likewise other motives, as
farre beyond these, as the heaven is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:115953:63"/>
the earth, either in dignity, or
situation: A most severe injunction
of their Master, such as they themselves
have delivered, such as they could not,
neither durst neglect: their writings
abound in precepts of truth and of ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racity,
and that prescribed under far
other conditions, and setled upon a far
surer foundation, upon the foundation
of truth it self, the originall and the
Ideall truth of the world; and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
to them under far other pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalties:
they knew full well and taught
to others, that of every idle word, which
men shall speak, an account must be
given at the day of judgement: how
dreadfull an account then must they
have expected, if they should have deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
falshood in the place of truth, if
they should have told a lye for God, or
lyes of God, or delivered impostures
in the name of God? nay verily, the
necessity which lay upon them, compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to others, doth as farre exceed it; as
the fear of a little disreputation is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
by the horrour of eternall tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments:
and now their practise was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
answerable to their obligation, and
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:115953:64"/>
what they delivered, in their speeches
and writings, was fully exampled in
their lives. We have before intimated
that whosoever will charge an authour
with a lye, he must either detect the
lewdnesse and corruption of their lives,
or at least wise manifest what they
might gain by their report; the former
could never be by their sworn enemies
detected, nay <hi>Julian</hi> the great Apostate
could charge them with nothing but
simplicity: now then, all the gain that
can be, is reducible

they were forced to undertake labours,
and travels, and watchings, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniencies
of great and painfull in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry:
they were daily opposed to
hunger and thirst, and cold and naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse;
nay, to torments and to death:
instead of gaining an estate, they were
enforced to forsake all that they had to
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:115953:65"/>
live an ambulatory kinde of life, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any certain being, depending as it
were on the Ravens, to provide them
their meat from one day to another.
Instead of that same freedome and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
which men affect, they entred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a straighter and more narrow way
then the way of the world, they were
forced to deny themselves, even such
things as they knew were lawfull, and
they were abridged even of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
enjoyments of mankinde, not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
to converse with freedom, or to
breath with safety: they no sooner
came to a city, but there they were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuted
and forced to fly unto another.
That which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> spoke of himself
as he was making his last voyage up to
<hi>Jerusalem,</hi> might have been the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Motto of them all, Now I goe
bound in the Spirit up to <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> not
knowing what things shall befall me,
only the holy Ghost that testifies in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
city that bonds and afflictions abide
me there.</p>
               <p>As for the matter of honor and repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
that was all in the hands of their
enemies, the Jews, and the Greeks:
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:115953:65"/>
they preached Christ crucified, to the
Jews a stumbling block, to the Greeks
foolishnesse; and all the credit which
they obtained at their hands was, to be
accounted a company of silly men, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentious
for a thing of nothing, a que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
about names, about one Jesus
which was dead, whom they affirmed
to be alive: this was the opinion of
the Gentiles; and by the Jews they
were looked upon as revolters, and so
not fit to live: as for this sect we know
that it is every where spoken against;
and they were hereby rendred the scorn
and derision of the world, the off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scouring
of the people: what shall I
more say? they were deprived of all
the enjoyments of the world, and cast
into all the miseries, or in the words
of the Authour to the Hebrews, <hi>They
wandred about in sheep-skins and goat-skins,
being destitute, afflicted, tormented; and all for
the delivery of the things contained in those
bookes:</hi> and if we will sadly consider it
we can assigne no cause of this their
choice, but the force of truth prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on them, and the urging of their
conscience, by the continuall instiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:115953:66"/>
of them by that spirit which act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them, making their hearts hot, and
kindling a fire within them, a fire in
their bosome, which they could not
suppresse. We cannot but speake the
things which we have seen and heard:
they suffered for their profession that,
never men did; and so we have greater
reason to beleeve them then any other
men.</p>
               <p>And we have still greater arguments
then these, because that God himselfe
gave testimony to their words and wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings;
and that both in their own times,
and the times which did succeed them:
in their own times by miracles; in the
succeeding generations by accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their predictions.</p>
               <p>The Apostles then, in confirmation of
their doctrine, were endowed with a
miraeulous power from on high, and
manifested to all the world, that they
had received in great abundance their
portions of the spirit, from him that
had the spirit not by measure: they
preached, and as they preached, they
confirmed their doctrine by mighty
signs and wonders, and evident manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stations
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:115953:66"/>
of the holy Ghost; so evident,
that when they had delivered the rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of them to a gain-saying, a croo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
and perverse generation, assigning
the times and places, and other circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances,
their spightfull enemies could
never detect them of the least impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture;
but were forced, though their
teeth gnashed while they spake, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse,
that indeed great miracles were
done by them; that this was evident
and they were not able to deny it; nay,
such was the evidence of the miracles
performed by them, that some of them
have been recorded in the annals of
heathen Authours (<hi>Phlegon,</hi>) that they
were appealed unto by the primitive
Christians (in the times next succeed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Apostles) in all their Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies
for the Christian faith, in their A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pologies
made to the Heathen Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours,
they are appealed unto as things
commonly known by the world, yeeld<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
without contradiction, which could
not with any fore-head be denied; they
were, I say, appealed unto, and that
to the greatest enemies of the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
and that by way of challenge to
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:115953:67"/>
the triall, and that without any reply
as to the falshood of them, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any recrimination; nay, which is
yet much more, there were not only by
these men themselves, but even at their
sepulchres when they were dead, great
miracles performed, for divers centuries
of years, and that so certainly, that it
was confessed by the sorest enemies of
the Church, such I mean, as were of the
School of <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> that by Magick
Arts strove to out-doe the performances
of Christ, particularly by that mad
Dogge <hi>Porphyrius,</hi> and others. Unlesse
then, men will deny God the honour
due unto him, and make him by his
presence, and testimony authorize im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posture,
there can be no scruple made
of the truth of these mens writings, but
they must be beleeved before the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
of any others in the world, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
they likewise could have done such
acts as these have done, unlesse they
could have cast out devils by their
words, have given the holy Ghost by
the imposition of their hands, unlesse
they could have healed all manner of
diseases, the blinde, the lame, the deaf,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:115953:67"/>
the dumb, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> by words, touch, shad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow;
or could have spoke all sorts of
Languages, or rather at one speaking
could have brought to passe, that men
of every language should perfectly have
understood their speech, as if it had
been their own: <hi>Parthians,</hi> and <hi>Medes,</hi>
and <hi>Elamites,</hi> and the dwellers in <hi>Meso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potamia,</hi>
and <hi>Judea,</hi> and <hi>Cappadocia, Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi>
and <hi>Asia, Phrygia,</hi> and <hi>Pamphilia,
Egipt,</hi> and the parts of <hi>Lybia,</hi> about
<hi>Cyrene,</hi> strangers of <hi>Rome, Jews,</hi> and
<hi>Proselytes, Cretes</hi> and <hi>Arabians,</hi> they all
heard them speak in their own tongues.</p>
               <p>Nor did it please the Lord of the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
of all flesh, here to stint the dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sations
of his holy spirit to them, he
gave them not only the power of mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,
but the spirit of prophecy, he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folded
to them the everlasting rolls, and
admitted them into his decrees, and
would not hide from them the things,
which he meant to bring to passe, in
the generations to come: he urged them
by his holy Spirit, and they foretold
the fates of the world, they foretold it,
and God brought it to passe: I cannot
stand to reckon up all their prophecies
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:115953:68"/>
which they delivered, and shortly after
they were fulfilled, of the spreading
of that leaven, of the growth of that
grain of mustardseed, of the mighty
and wonderfull propagation of the
faith, and the perpetuall enduring of
it, of the rejection of it by the Jews,
and the receiving of it by the Gentiles,
of the hatred of the Jews, and the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
which were to be undergone by
the glorious Martyrs, of the destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and the calamities of
that faithlesse Nation: all these make
it evident that God was with them;
that there is infinitely more reason to
beleeve the writers of the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
then any other writers.</p>
               <p>That none can disbeleeve them, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
forfeiting his reason, by asserting
that God would give testimony to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posture.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>That the Old Testament is
the Word of God. A
Proposall of three seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
assertions, whereby it
is concluded.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>HAving demonstrated that the Books
of the New Testament are all of
them to be received under the authority
and credit of the word of God, that
the dogmaticall parts are to be recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
upon the credit of the Histories,
and the Histories upon the common
principles of reason, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
that no man professing to be guided
by reason and judgement can refuse
them. It remains, that we demonstrate
the same of the Old Testament, and
that we take off those colours, and
answer those Sophisms, which by some
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:115953:69"/>
men are urged against the Scripture, and
so conclude this argument.</p>
               <p>Before I proceed to the former of
these, I must call to your remembrance
that which, in the beginning, I did pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise,
that under the title of the Books
of the Old Testament, I did compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
those, and those only, which in the
Church of <hi>England</hi> have been admitted,
under the name of the Books of the
Canonicall Scripture: and that I had
no purpose at all to meddle with the
controversies, which are betwixt us and
the Romane Church, about the books
which are Apocryphall: the reason,
why the Church hath entertained them
only, into the Canon, is, because they
onely were of the Canon of the Jews
beleef, before the coming of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,
they only being written in the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew
tongue, and consigned by <hi>Esdras</hi>
at the return of the Jews from the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilonish
captivity, as is generally belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
amongst the Jewish Rabbines,
whilest the Prophets <hi>Haggai, Zachary,</hi>
and <hi>Malachy</hi> were yet alive.</p>
               <p>Now although the way to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate
the truth of them, considering the
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:115953:69"/>
question apart, and by ic self, be the
same with the way, whereby we did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrate
the truth of the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
by asserting the Authours of them
to have been those men to whom they
were evermore ascribed; and from the
qualities of the things delivered (in
matter of History) and the characters
of those persons, who have delivered
the severall parts of it, to demonstrate,
that no reason can be imagined, why
such men, as those are and must be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
to be, should deliver such impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stures
as those must be, supposing them
to be impostures; that no end or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
can be discovered, which they
should propound to themselves for their
reward, but on the contrary that many
reasons are visible, why they should
have held their peace, if they durst have
concealed those things from the world;
the reasons from safety, gain, glory, and
the like, as might either jointly or se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verally
be demonstrated, of even all the
books of the Law, and of the Prophets,
which make up the greatest part (<hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi>
together with the Law having deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
likewise the shame of himself, and
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:115953:70"/>
                  <hi>Miriam,</hi> and <hi>Aaron.</hi> The Prophets ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
been all or most of them hardly
used: which of the Prophets have not
your Fathers persecuted?) Although,
I say, this had been the naturall way to
demonstrate the matter in question, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
singly and apart by it selfe; yet
partly to avoid the similitude of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
which renders unpleasant even the
most profitable discourses, and partly
to make a present dispatch of this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument,
I shall content my self to have
put you thus in minde, that all those
generall arguments, for the truth and
credit of those writers, are common to
these as well as to the others; and that
there needs no variation of them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to be applied to the question now
in hand, any other then the interchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
of their severall names, their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonall

accidents: In a word, that the
kindes of the Arguments are the same,
and the force of reason alike in both,
allowing only the difference of gradual
and individuall circumstances.</p>
               <p>This being premised, the summe of
what I shall further say is briefly this,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:115953:70"/>
That 1. In the time of our Saviour, and
the Apostles, these Bookes were true.
2. That since that time they have not
been changed.</p>
               <p>From which two Propositions it will
follow, that still they are so; and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
that the Books of the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament,
as well as of the New, are the
Word of God.</p>
               <p>As touching these propositions, the
truth of them will be inferred by this
ratiocination.

               <argument>
                  <p>The first Assertion proved,
That the Books of the
Old Testament which
we now receive are the
same which the Jews doe
now receive.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THat those Canonicall Books which
we receive are the self same with
those which the Jews at the present do
receive, is a case so plain, that it needs
no manner of proof, but only this, that
it is obvious to every man to compare
our English or Latine Bibles with the
Hebrew Bibles, which are used amongst
the Jews at present, and daily put
forth by the present Rabbines, residing
in the severall parts and dominions of
the world; upon such a comparison it
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:115953:71"/>
will be found, that we do own the self
same Books which they do, without
any difference in the number or inscri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptions,
chapters, or verses of those
Books: such as do doubt of this, they
must take the pains to try, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve
themselves by their own experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
or else if they are not able, or
not willing to take the pains to make
themselves their own resolvers, they
must of necessity beleeve the multitude
of those, that have already tried it, and
finding it to be generally granted, and
allowed of all men, and all parties,
however differing otherwise amongst
themselves, they must upon that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
either beleeve the Proposition, or
else devise some way how, and for what
end it should be brought to passe, that
the learned men of all Nations, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligions,
Jews, Christians, Papists, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants,
Turks, Pagans, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> should a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
together to impose upon that part
of people, that cannot or will not fit
themselves, to resolve a question, so easie
and of such concernment.</p>
               <p>Now, that all these sorts of men doe
thus agree, must likewise be beleeved,
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:115953:72"/>
untill some one instance can be produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to the contrary: the truth is, the
thing being a matter liable to the triall
of common sence, and obvious to all
the world, there is no more controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie
made of it, among the learned, then
of a principle in Mathematicks.</p>
               <p>It is true indeed, that as concerning
the interpretation of those books, there
is, and almost, ever was a great deal of
controversie amongst the learned, (but
none as to the number and to the parts
of those that are delivered amongst the
Jews) and it is likewise true, that the
beleif, of farre the greatest number of
Christians, doth in its kinde depend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the questionable fidelity of transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
and that fidelity of theirs, if it be
to be tried, that must be done by means
which are not exempt from question:
all therefore which can be said in this
matter is that unlesse we can attain to
skill sufficient for our own satisfaction
in this question, we take into thought
the qualifications of Translators, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of skill and of fidelity; and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partially
that we consider all those ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall
heads and grounds, whereon men
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:115953:72"/>
use to settle their belief, amongst which
no greater evidence can be expected
then there is in cases where all agree;
and such is the main body of ours, and
other translations likewise: this that I
have spoken of translations is indeed a
digression from the proposition I should
demonstrate, seeing when we speak of
the sacred authority of the holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures
we mean it not of translations, as
they are such, but primarily of the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginals,
and of translations, only so far
as they are consonant to those origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals.
And thus much is indeed sufficient
both for the assertion, and explication of
that proposition, that the books which
we receive, they are the same which the
Jews receive.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>That the Bookes, which the

the same which they
have received ever since
the Consignation of their
Canon.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>BUt secondly, the Bookes which the
Jews do now receive, they are the
same which they did formerly receive,
upwards to the time of our Saviour, and
his Apostles; nay, beyond them to the
very time of the consignation, or sealing
up the Canon of their beleif, that is,
their Bookes were never changed nor
corrupted.</p>
               <p>It is not here my purpose to assert,
that never any letter or word hath been
changed, or formerly read otherwise
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:115953:73"/>
then now it is in the Jewish Bibles, (I
am not so far unacquainted with their
<hi>Keri</hi> and <hi>Chetib,</hi> or with the notes of
the <hi>Massoreth</hi>) but that there hath not
been made any variation so considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
as to shake the authority of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
coppies. Of these various readings
I hope to speak in the answering obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.
In the interim, I am to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate,
that they have not received any
considerable depravation.</p>
               <p>And now this being a negative Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position,
common reason doth present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
offer it to every ones judgement, that
it cannot be positively proved, the very
nature of such propositions, contradict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that manner of proof: the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
then, which are producible, are
some of them taken, from the causes
why they could not (morally) be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted;
the other from signs that <hi>de fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cto</hi>
they have not been so.</p>
               <p>The first argument then is taken from
the multitude of copies, which it was
impossible to combine together to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
upon design, or that they should
accidentally agree together in the same
casuall corruptions.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="130" facs="tcp:115953:74"/>
It is certainly apparent out of the
Histories of the Jews, that after their
first and second captivities, they did
store themselves with multitudes of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies
of the sacred books, and that both
publikely and privately; that which, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they were dispersed, either was not
so necessary to them, or else was not so
apprehended by them: so long as the
first Temple was yet unrazed, we reade
but of very few (if any) Synagogues
of the Jews in other Nations, out of the
bounds and terrirores of <hi>Iudea:</hi> but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
by their long and wofull captivity,
when their confidence in the protection
of their Law and their Temple had, by
their sad experience and wofull suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
worn it self out of their mindes,
their Temple being utterly demolished,
the best of them began to think that it
was possible that even the Law might
fail: (<hi>Habbakuk</hi>) and they now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thought
themselves, of making use of
the rationall means of the preservation
of it; in the mindes of men, and seeing
there could not be any readier way
thought upon then the erecting of Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogues,
and writing many copies,
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:115953:74"/>
these were the courses which they took,
(they had had experience of the incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience
of having one only copy, in
the losse of that copy, which being
found again by <hi>Hilkiah</hi> the Priest, made
King <hi>Iosiah</hi> to rend his clothes, at the
hearing of those things written in the
Law) and accordingly we finde, before
the coming of our Saviour, many Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues
erected in forrain places, and
the books of the Law, and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
in every Synagogue, reade every
Sabbath day; now every dispersion en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased
the number of Synagogues and
Books. And besides the first captivity
of the Tribes carried into <hi>Media</hi> by the
Assyrians, we shall finde them, even af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
they had licence from <hi>Cyrus</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn,
continuing still abroad, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
many new occasions again disper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed:
those that reade over sacred Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
and prophane, shall finde them seat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in most of the Eastern Countries ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jacent
<hi>Iudea,</hi> or not farre distant from
thence: the Macedonians invited them
to <hi>Alexandria,</hi> the cruelties of <hi>Antiochus,</hi>
the civill warres of the <hi>Asmonaei,</hi> the
armies of <hi>Pompey,</hi> and <hi>Lossius,</hi> drove ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:115953:75"/>
of them from their habitations: the
cities of <hi>Cyrene,</hi> of <hi>Asia, Macedonia,</hi> and
<hi>Lycaonia,</hi> the Islands of <hi>Cyprus</hi> and <hi>Crete,</hi>
and divers others, even <hi>Rome</hi> it self, they
were all of them furnished with Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
and Synagogues of the Jews: now
so it is that the Books of all these did
agree together amongst themselves,
which they could not have done if any,
and not all of them should have been
corrupted; and that all of them should
either casually or by design be corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
(besides that no end can appear to
encourage such a designe) the thing
it self makes it impossible.</p>
               <p>Besides, had any such thing been, they
must, to make a correspondence, have
corrupted likewise the Septuagint tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slation,
which for almost three hundred
years before our Saviour was extant in
<hi>Egipt;</hi> that I speak nothing of the <hi>Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dee
Paraphrase</hi> extant before the time of
our blessed Saviour: so then, as far as
the nature of a morall subject will ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit,
we have shewed, as from the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
that the Scriptures of the Old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
could not be corrupted.</p>
               <p>Now as from the signes we have like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:115953:75"/>
powerfull arguments, that to our
Saviours time, they were uncorrupted,
because our Saviour never discovers any
corruption of the Text, which certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
he would not have spared, at such
times as he taxes the Scribes and Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sees
of making the Law of God of none
effect, by their traditions.</p>
               <p>Now, that the Hebrew Canon hath
not been corrupted since our Saviours
time, we have this sign likewise, that
never any of the ancient Fathers have,
in their greatest heat of zeal against the
Jews accused them of such corruption,
though <hi>Justin Martyr</hi> complain of wron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
the Septuagints Translation; and
certainly if they should have corrupted
them upon design, either before or since,
it would have been in all those places
which conclude against them, for Christ,
(the true Messiah, that stumbling stone,
upon which they stumbled and fell:) but
those do remain unaltered.</p>
               <p>The truth is, to them were committed
the Oracles of God, and they have, by
the visible ordination of the providence
of God, discovered so much care and
diligence that way, as is not to be found
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:115953:76"/>
to have been bestowed upon any other
writings under heaven: witnesse the
Criticall notes of their <hi>Massoreth,</hi> which
gives an account of the numbers of
of letters in every Book almost, and
almost, if not altogether, of every vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
lection. I conclude then that they
have never been corrupted.</p>

               <p>BUt we, in our Saviours time they
were true, and the Word of God,
as appears by our Saviours testimony,
and the testimony of the Apostles, who
still referre to them as being of divine
inspiration, as being the truth and
Word of God, their using the testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
almost of every particular Book, as
anthenticall, their disputations found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon their Authority. Particulars
in this kinde are so many, and so plain,
that without any more speaking I will
conclude, that we are to receive the
Old Testament upon the credit of the
New; and the New Testament (as I
have formerly demonstrated) upon
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:115953:77"/>
greater reason far then any other wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
in the world; and consequently
that we must receive the Books of the
Old Testament upon the same Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
               <p>We have already discovered some of
those many reasons, whereupon we are
to receive the Books of the Old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and the New, under the credit
and authority of the Word of God.
Besides those whereupon I have insisted
there are many more; some of them
taken from the quality of the writers,
some from the manner of the writings,
the former shewing that those men, from
whom they proceeded, were not fit per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
to devise such things, they being ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
if not most of them, simple and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned
men; the latter manifesting that
such things are not, of their nature, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious
to be devised, because they tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend
the wit and invention of man;
the Majesty and simplicity of the stile,
the concord and harmony, the end and
scope, the power and efficacy, the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity;
besides the Testimony of the
Spirit in the hearts of men.</p>
               <p>But the evidence of truth no way de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:115953:77"/>
upon the multitude of argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
or reasons, and all of these be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
insisted on in some or other of those
Authours which are obvious, I shall at
this time finish what remains, of that
which at the first I propounded, which
was to shew, That as there are many and
important reasons, moving wise men to
receive them, so there neither are nor
can be any sufficient arguments on the
contrary, to make men to refuse them.</p>

               <p>Those who refuse the whole Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures,
they are some of them Atheists,
others professe themselves Christians,
and yet doe deny the authority of the
written word, pretending to private
and secret illuminations, as the last rule
of their actions: the design of my dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:115953:79"/>
being against the former, I shall
only intimate the frenzy of the later.
They pretend, that that, which we call
the written word, is not the Word of
God, because
<list>
                     <item>1. The Word of God is God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe.</item>
                     <item>2. Christ is the Word of God.</item>
                     <item>3. The Letter kils.</item>
                     <item>4. The Word of God is spirit and
life.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>These are the arguments which, by
some Enthusiasts, are used against the
written Letter. And for answer to
them, we may only observe, how, by ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guing
against the authority of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures,
these men do tacitely assert it;
for taking their arguments out of it,
and proceeding no further, either by
reason or revelation, to the discovery of
their antecedents, but barely resting in
the recitall of those words which are
there written, they do resolve all the
power and force of their argument into
the authority of those very writings
which they would impugne, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
they do at once deny and grant,
the authority of the Scripture; which
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:115953:79"/>
is to deserue the Epithete, which is given
them, of fanaticall Enthusiasts.</p>
               <p>That the Word of God is God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
(taking the Word of God for the
immanent act of the diuine understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing)
is indeed a truth attainable by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
principles, by those I mean from
whence the absolute simplicity of the
divine nature is attainable. But that
Christ is the eternall word of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and that there is such a spirit and
life, as the argument doth imply, and
that there is a divine and mysticall mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of that letter of the word, they
either owe their faith unto that word,
or else they have not done very chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably
in concealing those waies where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
they come to know it, and very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>providently
in giving occasion for us to
beleeve, that their pretences of illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
are but pretences.</p>
               <p>Now for that other party, who
doe reject the Scriptures (the whole
bulk of them) their Arguments are
these,
<list>
                     <item>I. Because they deliver things impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible,
and consequently incredible, and
so they are not to be beleeved.</item>
                     <item>
                        <pb n="142" facs="tcp:115953:80"/>
2. Because they deliver things repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
and contradictory to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</item>
                     <item>3. Because the Books of the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament
are doubtfull, by reason of the
differences of the Text and Margent.
And the Books of the New Testament
are likewise uncertain, by reason of the
various readings of severall copies.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. Those things which the Atheisti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
partie use to object, against the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of the Scripture as impossible
and incredible, they are the miracles
performed by <hi>Moses</hi> and the Prophets,
by Christ and his Apostles, but if we
shall attentively consider them, we shall
finde, that they doe include in them no
contradiction, nor any absolute impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
of the performance; the utmost
that can be justly concluded from them,
is, that they transcend the ordinary
course of the dispensation of that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,
which orders the world, and
administers the laws of the government
thereof. But, upon the hearing or read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of extraordinary events, presently,
(though they have been sufficiently at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tested)
to disbeleeve them, upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:115953:80"/>
of reason to the contrary, discovers
palpably the want of the exercise of
that reason, whereto they so much pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend:
for a man to deny, such matters
of fact as he is not able to comprehend
the reason of, must either suppose the
party, to know the causes of all appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances
in nature, or conclude him guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of childish, and ridiculous increduli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
We have before demonstrated the
Omniscience, and the Omnipotence of
the Divinity; and that being, as hath
been actually proved, clearly and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
demonstrable, for the contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptible
wit, and reasoning of man to
prescribe limits, and bounds to that
power and knowledge, is no lesse, then
to own the acknowledgement of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction,
by professing that, to be li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited
and finite, which the naturall
principles of our understandings, will
force us to acknowledge of necessity to
be immense and infinite.</p>
               <p>It cannot be thought a thing impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible,
that God should either raise the
dead, or command the Sunne to stand
still in <hi>Gibea,</hi> by him that considers,
what it is to be the originall of life, or
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:115953:81"/>
to have created the Universe with the
word of his eternall power, the things
which are impossible with men, they are
possible with God: and consequently
we having before concluded the vanity
and madnesse of Atheism, shall need to
say no more, to evince the frivolous
weaknesse of this Argument, from the
impossibilities.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As for those repugnances and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions,
which some men vainly
please themselves, imagining they have
found them in the Scripture, if they be
well examined, they will be proved to
be but so many instances of the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
or inadvertancy of the Objectors
those which have been made against the
Old Testament, have long agoe been
found by <hi>Rabbi Moses ben Maimoni</hi> not to
have taken in all those conditions,
which have been by Philosophers disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
to be required to make up a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
contradiction, that is, that contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
assertions be made of the same thing
at the same time, according to the same
part, or motion, or apprehension: and
the same hath been lately performed by
<hi>Manasseh ben Israel,</hi> in his conciliator for
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:115953:81"/>
the Old Testament. It hath likewise, for
the New; been long since performed by
many of the Fathers, and of late by
diverse of all professions, Papists, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants
and their severall subdivisions.
The matters of Doctrine are easily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled
by distinguishing the notions of
severall terms, so for example, as faith
is said by <hi>Paul</hi> to justifie, and works by
<hi>Jame.,</hi> by distinguishing of Justificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
and the matters of History are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled
by attending to times, and pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
persons, and forms of speech. Thus
are the differences cleared, which are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the Genealogies of our Saviour,
delivered by Saint <hi>Matthew</hi> and Saint
<hi>Luke.</hi> The truth is, there could never
any considerable difference, either in
matter of doctrine or history, be urged
against the Scriptures; yet if some
slight and inconsiderable circumstances
should seem to us so to differ that we
could not reconcile them, it ought ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to confirme our beleef, then any
way to shake it; seeing it is the custome
of those who designe to impose upon
mens beleef, so to contrive all circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
as they may be sure to have no
difference discovered.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="146" facs="tcp:115953:82"/>Such is, in truth, the agreement and
harmony of all these authors, so distant
in time, in place, in institution, as is
not to be found in any other authours
in the world, though of the same sect,
either in Philosophy, Law, Physick, or
any other faculty; nor yet in any one
man with himself; as might be manifest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
if either this time or place requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
it. And so instead of an objection to
shake us, we have found an argument to
confirm us.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The third Argument or objection
against the whole Books of Scripture is
taken from the <hi>Keri</hi> and <hi>Chetib</hi> of the
Old Testament; and from the various
readings of the New; from those they
conclude them to be doubtfull, from
these corrupted.</p>
               <p>Now the former of these is answered
by the Jewish RR <hi>Isaac Jacob</hi> of old, <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lias
Levita</hi> of later times, who do deny
the consequence of that Argument, and
make it manifest that those were added
for signification of some mystery, and
not because the Text was doubtfull:
and for proof of their assertion they
prove, that the Books of <hi>Haggai, Zachary,
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:115953:82"/>
Malachy, Daniel</hi> and <hi>Ezra,</hi> had those mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall
notes added to them by their au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours,
who all were members of the
<hi>Synagoga magna,</hi> and made the consigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Jewish Canon: these could
not be doubtfull of the sense of their
own writings; and consequently from
those marginall notes, the doubtfulnesse
of the Old Testament can no way just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
be concluded.</p>
               <p>As touching the various readings of
some places of the New Testament, we
cannot deny but that through the fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of some Scribes, there are found in
the most ancient copies of those books
some differences of letters, or some few
syllables, or words; but this we deny,
that those are sufficient, from whence
to conclude the books not to be credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted;
for upon the same reason it will
be concluded that no Book in the world
is to be credited, unlesse they can be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifested
to be exempted from the slips
and failings of transcribers. Nay, the
consideration of those various readings,
are very strong arguments that the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of the writings are incorrupted,
and that they were never changed upon
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:115953:83"/>
design, seeing the differences that are do
no way inferre any difference, either in
the Doctrine or History of the Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
it was of the favour and mercy
of God to preserve to his Church those
various readings, that by comparing
them together, and likewise with the
rest of the holy Scriptures, both the
true sence and the true reading of them
might at once be manifested.</p>

                     <hi>Hebrews</hi> was rejected by the <hi>Latine;</hi>

and because of some passages
especially seeming to favour the Nova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian

                  <p n="1">1. It is not the name of an authour
which gives credit to his Writings, but
that character of his person which is
drawn from his abilities and integrity.
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:115953:84"/>
Now these were never doubted of in
that Authour.</p>

admit it, we may as well beleeve, that
that Church had reasons which satisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them of the authority of it, at such
time as they did receive it.</p>
                  <p>The Epistles of Saint <hi>James,</hi> 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> of
<hi>S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Peter,</hi> the second and third of <hi>S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> John,
Jude, Revelations,</hi> have all of them been
doubted of, for some time; by some par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
whether or no they were indeed
written by those authours, under whose
names they are now received: but
though they were some time doubted by
some, they were alwaies received by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers;
and those Churches which did
refuse them, so long as they were unsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied,
are to be supposed to have been
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:115953:85"/>
satisfied when they did receive them; and
so we ought to give as great, if not grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
cedit to them, then to such others as
had not been questioned; inasmuch as
that which hath been deliberated, and
debated, and then decided, is to be cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dited,
as well as that which silently hath
passed on unquestioned.</p>
                  <p>And now I have with brevity (as I
suppose) congruous to such an Essay
as I intended, made evident the last as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertion
which I undertook, That to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleeve,
either the whole body of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
or any part of it, there is no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son;
or not any sufficient reason.</p>
