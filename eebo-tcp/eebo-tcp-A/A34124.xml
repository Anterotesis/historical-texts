            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>Fellow CITIZENS,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> Am no Orator, I own it, nor ever made a Speech in my Life, but once in the Vestry, about choosing a Lecturer, and new Lettering the Church-Buckets: but this I'll be bold to say, That no Man is a hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier Well-wisher to the Prosperity of this Protestant City than my self. Now I must tell you, Gentlemen, that you don't take so much Notice of a certain Author, who does you the Honour to reside among you, as his great Qualities deserve. You only consult him as a Physician; and indeed I must needs say he is a pretty Physician; He has eas'd many of you of those heavy Burdens, call'd Wives and Children; and, out of his Zeal to the Publick, has helpt to thin the overstock of Traders: But still you must give me leave to tell you, that you overlook his principal Talent, for Physick is what he va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lues himself least upon. He is a Poet, pray be not scandalized at the Word, he is a Poet, I say, but of sober solid Principles, and as hearty an Enemy to Wit as the best of you all: he has writ twenty thousand Verses and upwards without one Grain of Wit in them; nay, he has declar'd open War against it, and, despising it in himself, is resolved not to endure it in any one else. When he is in his Coach, instead of pretending to read where he can't see, as some Doctors do; or thinking of his Patient's Case, which none of them do, he is still listning to the Chimes, to put his Ear in tune, and stumbles upon a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stich every Kennel he is jolted over. Nay, even in Coffee-houses, when other People are cleansing <hi>Chester</hi>-Harbour, banishing Popish Priests, disposing the Crown of <hi>Spain,</hi> repairing <hi>Dover</hi>-Peer, pitying the poor <hi>Scots</hi> at <hi>Darien,</hi> or settling the Affairs of <hi>Poland,</hi> he is enditing Heroics on the back of a News-Paper with his Pencil, and wou'd give more for a Rhime to <hi>Radziouski</hi> than a Specific for the Gout. Those flashy Fellows, your <hi>Covent-garden</hi> Poets, are good for nothing, but to run into our Debts, lye with our Wives, and break unman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerly Iests upon us Citizens; then, like a parcel of Sots, they write for Fame and Immortality; but this Gentleman is above such Trifles, and, as he prescribes, so he writes for the Good of Trade. He's a particular Benefactor to the Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facture of the Nation; and, at this present Minute, to my certain knowledge, keeps Ten Paper-mill a going with his <hi>Job</hi> and <hi>Habakkuk,</hi> and his other <hi>Hebrew</hi> Heroes. There's scarce a Cook, Grocer, or Tobacconist within the City-Walls but is the better for his Works; nay, one that is well acquainted with his Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret History, has assured me, that his main design in writing the two <hi>Arthurs,</hi> whatever he pretended in his Preface, was only to help the poor Trunk-makers at a Pinch, when <hi>Quarles</hi> and <hi>Ogilby</hi> were all spent, and they wanted other Materials. Above all, you can't imagine what a singular Deference he pays to a golden Chain; 'tis impossible for a rich Man with him, either to be a Knave or a Blockhead: he never sees the Cap of Maintenance, but is ready to worship
<pb facs="tcp:46238:3"/>
it; and, in compliment to the Sword-bearer, wou'd, I dare engage for him, sooner write a Panegyric upon Custard, than any of the Cardinal Virtues, tho' he pretends to be their Champion.</p>
            <p>This may serve, Fellow-Citizens, to give you some Idea of the Man; but what we most want his Assistance in, is to reform several enormous Abuses that have crept in among us. <hi>The Poetry of our</hi> Bell-men, <hi>which in its first In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution contain'd many excellent Lessons of Piety,</hi> is grown very <hi>loose and immoral,</hi> and gives our Wives and Daughters wicked Ideas, when it awakes them at Midnight. The Tobacco-boxes too <hi>seem engag'd in a general Confederacy to bring Vice into esteem</hi>; their lewd Inscriptions <hi>charge Religion with desperate Resolution, and have given it many deep and ghastly Wounds.</hi> Our Posies for Rings <hi>are either immodest, or irreligious;</hi> and we <hi>see few Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi> on our Ale-house Signs, but <hi>have some spiteful and envious Strokes at Sobriety and Good-manners, whence the</hi> Apprentices of this Populous City <hi>have apparently received very bad Impressions. 'Tis great Pity that</hi> our Magistrates, <hi>in whose Power it is, have not yet restrained the Licentious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of</hi> these Rhimes, <hi>and obliged the Writers of them to observe more Decorum.</hi> But, since they are so remiss in their Duty, retain this Gentleman <hi>on the side of Religion,</hi> and you'll soon see these Enormities Vanish. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, being of a goodly Person, if you desired him now and then, upon a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Occasion, to walk before a Pageant, or march at the Head of the Blew-coat Infantry, at the Burial of one of his own Patients, with how much more Decency and Gravity wou'd those Public Ceremonies be perform'd? And then who so proper to inflame the Courages of our City-Militia, as our Parson tells me, one <hi>Tyrtaeus</hi> did of old, by the Repetition of his own Lines? Well, cou'd I but be so happy as to see him once appear in the Front of our <hi>Finsbury</hi>-Squadrons, or animate with his noble Compositions the Wrestlers in <hi>Moor-fields,</hi> I shou'd not doubt to see our ancient Military Genius come in Play, and every <hi>London</hi> 'Prentice able to worst his Brace of Lions. Therefore, Fellow-Citizens, for mine, for your own, and your Families sakes, hug and cherish this worthy Gentleman, make him free of all your Companies, for he's as well qualified for any of them as his own; carry him to all your Entertainments, nay even to your private Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berations over Brawn and Quest-ale, and when any foreign Ambassador is treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the City, get him to pay the Compliment in Verse, and the R-c-rd-r may second him in Prose; put the entire Management of <hi>Smithfield</hi> into his Hands, and make him absolute Monarch of all the Booths and Poppet-shews. Above all, let him endeavour by the Melody of his Rhimes (and what can withstand 'em?) to call back our fugitive Mercers from <hi>Covent-garden</hi> to <hi>Ludgate-hill</hi> and <hi>Pater-noster-row.</hi> Since we are for new Painting our City-gates, why should we not Furbish up our old Heroes in new Metre? Why should poor King <hi>Lud</hi> and his two trusty Sons, <hi>Temancus</hi> and <hi>Androgeus,</hi> be forgotten? Or what harm have the Giants at <hi>Guild-hall</hi> and <hi>Whittington</hi>'s Cat done to be buried in ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livion? There are a thousand other Subjects to employ his Muse, wherein he may discreetly intersperse some notable Precepts against Trusting, some pretty Touches in defence of Vsury, and some handsom Consolations for Cuckoldom, all which might be of admirable use to season and confirm our City-Youth in the true Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of their Ancestors: And what if you cou'd perswade him to write a few pacifying Strains to calm the distemper'd Spirits of our Car-men and the Oy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster-women at <hi>Bilingsgate?</hi> In short, these are some of the Topics you may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend to him. Let him make Verses for us Citizens, and prescribe Physic to the Fools without <hi>Temple-bar.</hi> I am,</p>
