         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Wherein also is something declared both to Judges and
Justices so called, concerning Contempt of Authority.</p>
            <p>Also the Ground and Cause of the Imprisonment of

the breach of no known Law, and cause some to be whip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped,

complain for the help of Magistrates, to have this people,
called <hi>Quakers,</hi> suppressed because they are affraid that
their Tythes and maintenance should faile them, and
they come to lose their gifts, and rewards; because we
cry against such as <hi>Isaiah</hi> cryed against, <hi>who seek for their

<hi>Matt.</hi> 23. and we cry against such as go in <hi>Cains</hi> way and
<hi>Balaams,</hi> which <hi>Iude</hi> cryed woe against <hi>Iude.</hi> 11. And
here they are affraid that their riches and honour should
faile them, whose riches is earthly, and honor is earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:
and here you Magistrates uphold such as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,
Christ, and his Apostles cryed against, and causes
the innocent to suffer by your wills, contrary to the Law
of Justice<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and equity; and so <hi>are filling up the measure of
your iniquities,</hi> who persecuted the true prophets of
Christ and his Apostles; and you may consider by the
Light in your consciences, what Reformation and Just
government is established by you, who have long professed
Liberty, Justice, and equity; when now this is the end of
your profession, and praying, and your fasting, and your
dayes of thanksgiving, even persecution, and <hi>oppressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and strengthening the hands of evil doers against the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent,</hi>
and so neglect the fast which the Lord requires,
read <hi>Isa. 58. 6. Is not this the fast that I have chosen, saith
the Lord, to loose the bands of wickedness, to undoe the heavy
burthens, and to</hi> Let <hi>the oppressed goe free, and that ye break
every yoak, but</hi> instead of this, ye strengthen the bands of
wickedness, and goes on in your cruelty, and oppression.
Ah wo, word, is the end of your profession, who are so

acting in your Cruelty, and Tyranny; against them who
for conscience sake cannot <hi>bow</hi> to your wills, but witness

of the Rulers, of <hi>Sodome,</hi> and people of <hi>Gomorrah</hi> was,
which the prophet <hi>Isai</hi> cryed against, who said unto

herein they seek not themselves, nor their own glory,

honoured and glorified among them who act in truth

of evil doers, and make strong the bands of wickedness,
who indite, and fine, and imprison those who cannot for

to satisfie your corrupt wills: wherein you are seeking

did suffer by that generation you are in, <hi>who suffered

for these vanities, will not hide you: for you say that
though you have no written Law of the Nation, for pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

that it is the custome of the Nation; as bowing
&amp;c and that the very heathens do bow, and that the

accustomed in this Nation,</hi> which many that act in, go
unpunished, which the righteous Law of God takes hold

<pb n="12" facs="tcp:107454:7"/>
be ashamed of your customs, who makes a Custome
a Law, to act in envy and cruelty, against the servants of
the Lord. And when you alledge, that <hi>Jacob bowed to
Esau, and called him Lord, and that Abraham bowed to
Seth,</hi> who was a Heathen. I answer, that which was act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

you and that you might seek honour one of another,
who profess your selvs to be Believers and Christians, to

and Abraham bowed, and Jacob called Esau Lord,</hi> who
was the elder, but when the elder was made to serve the

state, and the Heathenish nature, we are redeemed, and
the one Lord, who is the true God, we witness: so out
of the many gods, and many Lords, which are in the

vvho reigns over the house of <hi>Iacob,</hi> and is greater then

all your limits, who live in envy, and rage in the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenish

limit the righteous to walk in their steps, and to bow to
your proud flesh,: <hi>for as I live, saith the Lord, every knee
shall bow to me, and every Tongue shall confess unto god;</hi> as
you may read, <hi>Rom. 13. 11. Isai. 45. 23. Phil. 2.</hi> 10.
Therefore bow to the Lord of hosts, and let proud flesh
stoop before him, who seeks honour to your selves,
which belongs to God, <hi>Fear before the Lord, and tremble,

God: whose honour and glory we seek, and not the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor
of man: and therfore we cannot stoop nor bow to
your pride, nor conform to your vanities, which are act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in your wills, contrary to the pure Law of God; which
respects no mans person: and here you act for your own
ends, and punish the servants of the Lord, who for his
sake cannot submit to your deceit, and heathenish vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties;
you act contrary to the Law of God, and the Law
of the Nation, and for the Lords sake act not, neither

man and man, according to the truth, and equity,
by an outward Law, which takes hold upon transgressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,

said, the Kings of the Gentiles exercised Authority over

               <p>Therefore, ye Magistrates of this Nation, see whom

Just by that of God in your consciences, and your Just

whom Christ hath sent, you persecute Christ: therefore
now while the Lord doth not speedily execute his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments

is brought forth: when as we, who are sent of the Lord,
to bear witness unto pure religion, and to witnesse forth
a good conscience, and our labour and travel is, that
justice and equity might be set up, and deceit confound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
and also we being free born English men, may not
have freedom, to passe the high-way about our lawful
calling. But have such bonds, and snares, laid upon us
both contrary to the Law of God, and the law of the
Nation; and contrary to that liberty which hath been
promised to them professing Godlinesse by the supreme
of this Nation. As in the act for the government of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,

peace on their part; provided that this liberty be not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to Popery or Prelacy, nor to such who under the
profession of Christ hold forth and practise Licentious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</p>
               <p>Article 38: That all lawes, statutes, ordinances and

what performance there is acted by you, of these

is winked at, and acted by you who professe justice, and
are set in authority to act according to the law of justice
and to remove unjust causes: when now both contrary
to the law of God, and contrary to your own law, you
cause the servants of the Lord to suffer Whipping and
Imprisoning, them which you cannot charge which the
breach of any law: here be ashamed of your unjust act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
ye oppressors and persecutors of the innocent,
and know that at your cruelty the Lord will not winke,
but though you joyne hand in hand you shall not go
unpunished, and the very heathens may condemn you
that whip and act contrary to your own law, against
them, whom the law condemnes not: for when they
were ready to Whip <hi>Paul,</hi> he said to the centurion, Is it
lawfull for you, to scourge a man that is a Roman and
uncondemned, and said he was free borne, and so both
the centurion and the chiefe Captaine, who bound <hi>Paul</hi>
were afraid, after they knew that he was a Roman, and
caused him to be loosed: but though we be free-borne
English men and uncondemned by the law, you are
not ashamed to Whip and act in cruelty against us, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

sword of justice, ought not to be a terrour to good work-but
to the evill, and saith the Lord by his prophet <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>vid</hi>
he that ruleth over men must be just, ruling in the
feare of God, and such who rule in the feare of God,
are not persecutors of the innocent, but doth defend and
preserve, such as these men before mentioned whip and
persecute. For the law which because of transgression is
added, doth not take hold upon the innocent, which
no law hath transgressed. So ye who have acted your
cruelty upon the innocent, who in the sight of God, are
free from the breach of any known law, who according
to your own law, by you ought to be protected; here you
are found transgressors of the law, which because of
transgression is added, and with it are condemned, and
with the light of Christ you are seene to be the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates,
which beares the sword in vaine, who turnes
the edge of the sword against the righteous seed, which
you ought to turne against the wicked, that the land
might be emptyed of transgressors and evill doers: for
the law was not made for the righteous, but for the
lawless and disobedient; which law is witnessed by us,
(to be good in its place<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) who suffer by the wills of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable
men, contrary to the law of God and the
law of the Nation: for we who professe faith in God, by
Jesus Christ, and through faith hath victory obtained
over that nature, which leads into the transgression of
the Law, ought according to your own law, to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected
in the exercising of our religion, but you instead
of protecting us, whip and imprison us. And here
let your own law be a witnesse against you, and be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shamed
of your unjust actings, but the Lord of God of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
and Earth, (who is our protector) who is righteous,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:107454:11"/>
who beares not the sword in vaine, who will execute
the judgment upon the transgressor, who will reward
you according to your works, before him you shall not
be able to stand in judgment, in the day of your account,
therefore come downe to the light in your consciences,
which calls for justice and equity, and awake to righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse,
all ye that li<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

and therein act against the innocent, for the day
hastens wherein you will be found out by the righteous
judgments of God: for the cry of the innocent, which
is oppressed by you, hath entred into the eares of the
Lord of Sabbath, who will come quickly and reward e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
one of you according to your deeds. Therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
of your cruelty before the evill day come, least you
be found guilty of the blood of the innocent, when the
Lord calls you to an account: for know this that when
the Lord comes to plead with you, that of God in all
your consciences, will witnesse for God in his righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
judgments; therefore by that light which is pure
in your consciences learne your condemnation, and
own it upon those things before mentioned, which are
contrary to the light, that peradventure you may be hid

            <p>WHereas by many of the Magistrates, Priests, and
People of this Nation, we are accused of idleness,
who are sent by the Lord of the Harvest into his
Vineyard to dresse it (as the Disciples of Christ ever were) and
are faithful and diligent in his work, who hath called us,
(as the true Ministers, sent forth by Christ, were in all ages)
and are not idle, but do (as they did) by the same spirit, bear
witness against all such as live in idleness, and prophanenesse,
as the most part of these people do, who accuse us: such, as live
in pride and wantonness, who work not at all with their hands,
accuse us of idleness, who have a Cloud of witnesses for our
practice; for the holy men of God travelled from place to
place, (as we do) as they were moved of the Lord, and they
were sent (as we are) by the Lord; to testifie against such un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly
practices, as the people of the world live in; and the
same Generation in nature, hated and persecuted them, as do
hate and persecute us; And by the same holy spirit, ye are
tryed and found to be the idle persons, who accuse the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
of the Lord of idlenesse, who are in the work of the
Lord, labouring in his Vineyard. You Magistrates, Gentry,
Priests and people, who sport your selves in the day-time, and
wantonly lives upon the earth, feeding your selves with dainty
dishes, Dives-like, wasting the Creatures of God upon your
lusts, devouring the Creation, decking your selves in gorge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
attire, that you may be set up and esteemed of, above
your poor brethren, &amp; so are found Gentils in nature, exercising
Lordship over your brethren persecuting &amp; imprisoning them,
who are redeemed out of that nature you live in, who cannot
bow and worship you (as the Heathen do;) but know this, you
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:107454:13"/>
Gentiles, Priests and people, who lives in these practices, (in
envy, pride, idleness, and fulness of bread.) The day drawes
nigh, wherein you an account must give to the Creator, for
your envy and cruelty, and for the Creatures which you have
wasted, and do waste and devoure, upon your ungodly lusts;
and in the day of account, you will houle and lament, for the
misery which will upon you come; for, to the mighty God
of Heaven and Earth, the Creatour of all things, you an
account must give, for your pride and idleness, fulness and
gluttony, which you have lived in, and do live in, and your
reward you must receive, according to your deeds and practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
your outside formal profession will not at all avail you, in
the day of the Lord: And you shall then know, who have
lived in idleness, whether you who are found in the sins of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
alive, or we whom the Lord sends amongst you, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
against such practices, and to forewarn you of the evil,
which is to come upon you, who are found in these practices
and doth in life and word bear true testimony against you,
who live in, and practise such things daily, as is before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned.
And many of you are grown so dainty, and so curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
in your Dyet, and Apparrel, that you scarce know what to
eat, what to drink, or what to put on; and so causes the
whole Creation, to groan under the weight and burthen of
your corruptions: who lives in idleness, whose belly is your
God, who glory in your shame: And here both Priests and
Gentry, who accuses others of idleness, are caught in their
own snares: You who accuse us for idleness, who are in the
work of the Lord, or you your selves, who are found in the
work of the enemy of God, let the honest hearted judge, who
live in idleness: you who are enemies to the Servants of God,
which labours to have such practices destroyed, as causes the

not hide you; for the righteous judge, who will plead the
cause of the innocent, will finde you out, in the day of his
fierce wrath, which is comming upon you, which you cannot

cease, cease, from your pride and vain glory, ye high-minded
