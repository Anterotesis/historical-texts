            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HIS <hi>Tract</hi> will need <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronage,</hi> as Great as may be had, that's <hi>Yours.</hi> Yet, when I first Printed part of it, I presumed not to ask any, but thrust it out at the end of another's La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, that it might seem, at least, to have the same <hi>Patron,</hi> your <hi>Royal Father</hi> of Blessed Memory, as the other Work, on which this at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, had. But now I humbly beg for it Your <hi>Majesties Patronage;</hi> And leave withal, that I
<pb facs="tcp:62620:3"/>
may declare to Your <hi>Most Excellent Majestie</hi> the <hi>Cause</hi> why this Tract was then written: Why it stay'd so long before it looked upon the Light: Why it was not then thought fit to go alone, but rather be led abroad by the former Work: Why it comes now forth both with <hi>Alteration,</hi> and <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition:</hi> And why this <hi>Addition</hi> made not more haste to the Press, than it hath done.</p>
            <p>The Cause why this <hi>Discourse</hi> was written, was this: I was, at the time of these Conferences with Mr. <hi>Fisher,</hi> Bishop of S. <hi>Davids;</hi> And not onely <hi>directed,</hi> but <hi>commanded</hi> by my bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Master <hi>King JAMES</hi> to this <hi>Conference</hi> with him. He, <note n="a" place="margin">May 24. 1622.</note> when we met, began with a great Protestation of seeking the <hi>Truth</hi> onely, and that for it self. And certainly, <hi>Truth,</hi> especially in Religion, is so to be sought, or not to be found. He that seeks it with a Roman <note n="b" place="margin">One of these Biasses is an Aversion from all such Truth as fits not our Ends. And A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versus à Veritatis luce, ab hoc luci Veritatis adversus (fit) &amp;c. S. Aug. l. 2. cont. Adversarium Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gis &amp; Prophet. And 'tis an easie Transition, for a man that is Averse from, to become adverse to the Truth.</note> Bias, or any (b) <hi>Other,</hi> will run Counter, when he comes near it, and not finde it, though he come within <hi>kenning</hi> of it. And therefore I did most hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily wish, I could have found the <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suite</hi> upon that fair way he protested to go. After the Conference ended, I went, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>my Duty</hi> called me, to my <hi>Diocess;</hi> not suspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting any thing should be made Publike, that was both Commanded, and acted in Private. For <hi>W. I.</hi> the Publisher of the Relation of the first Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence with D. <hi>White</hi> (the late Reverend and Learned Bishop of <hi>Ely</hi>) <note n="c" place="margin">In the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistle to the Reader.</note> confesses plainly,
<pb facs="tcp:62620:3"/>
               <hi>That M.</hi> Fisher <hi>was straightly charged upon his Allegiance, from his Majestie that then was, not to set out, or Publish what passed in some of these Conferences, till He gave License, and until Mr.</hi> Fisher <hi>and they might meet, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, and Confirm under their Hands, what was said on both sides.</hi> He says farther, <hi>that</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
               <hi>Mr.</hi> Fisher <hi>went to Dr.</hi> White's <hi>house, to know what he would say about the Relation, which he had set out.</hi> So then, belike Mr. <hi>Fisher</hi> had set out the <hi>Relation of that Conference,</hi> before he went to Dr. <hi>White,</hi> to speak about it. And this notwithstanding the Kings <hi>Restraint</hi> upon him, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his <hi>Allegiance.</hi> Yet, to Dr. <hi>White</hi> 'tis said he went; but to what other end, than to put a Scorn upon him, I cannot see. For he went to his house to know, <hi>what he would say about that Relation of the Conference, which he had set out before.</hi> In my absence from <hi>London,</hi> Mr. <hi>Fisher</hi> used me as well. For with the same Care of his <hi>Allegiance,</hi> and no more, <note n="c" place="margin">These words were in my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Epistle. And A. C. checks at them, in defence of the Jesuite, and says: That the Jesuite did not at all so much as in Speech, and much less in Papers publish this, or either of the other two Conferences with Dr. White, till he was forc'd unto it by false reports given out to his private disgrace, and the preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice of the Catholike Cause. Nor then did he spread Papers abroad, but onely delivered a very few Copies to special friends, and this not with an intent to calumniate the Bishop, &amp;c. A. C. in his Preface before his Relation of this Conference. Truly, I knew of no Reports then given out to the prejudice of the Jesuit's either Person or Cause. I was in a Corner of the Kingdom<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> where I heard little. But howsoever, here's a most plain Confession by A. C. of that which he struggles to deny. He says he did not spread Papers. What then? What? Why he did but deliver Copies. Why but doth not he that delivers Copies (for instance, of a Libel) spread it? Yea, but he delivered but a very few Copies. Be it so<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I do not say, how many he spread. He confesses the Jesuite delivered some, though very few; And he that delivers any, spreads it abroad. For what can he tell, when the Copies are once out of his power, how many may copie them out, and spread them farther? Yea, but he delivered them to special friends. Be it so too: The more special friends they were to him, the less indifferent would they be to me, perhaps my more special enemies. Yea, but all this was without an intent to calumniate me. Well: Be that so too. But if I be calumniated thereby, his intention will not help it. And whether the Copies, which he delivered, have not in them Calumny against me, I leave to the Indifferent Reader of this Discourse to judge.</note> 
               <hi>he spread abroad Papers of this</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:62620:4"/>
               <hi>Conference, full enough of partialitie to his Cause, and more full of Calumny against me.</hi> Hereupon I was in a manner forced to give M. <hi>Fisher's Relation</hi> of the Conference an <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,</hi> and to publish it. Though for some <hi>Reasons,</hi> and those then approved <hi>by Authority,</hi> it was thought fit I should set it out in my Chaplain's Name <hi>R. B.</hi> and not in my own. To which I readily sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted.</p>
            <p>There was a cause also, why at the first, the <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course upon this Conference</hi> stayed so long, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it could endure to be pressed. For the <hi>Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence</hi> was in <hi>May,</hi> 1622. And M. <hi>Fisher's</hi> Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per was scattered and made common, so common, that a <hi>Copy</hi> was brought to me (<hi>being none of his spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial friends</hi>) before <hi>Michaelmas.</hi> And yet this <hi>Discourse</hi> was not printed till <hi>April,</hi> 1624. Now that you may know how this happened, I shall say for my self, It was not my <hi>Idleness,</hi> nor my <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willingness</hi> to right both my self, and the Cause, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Jesuite, and the <hi>Paper,</hi> which he had spred, that occasion'd this delay. For I had then <hi>Most Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Witnesses,</hi> and have some yet living, That this <hi>Discourse</hi> (such as it was, when <hi>A. C.</hi> nibled at it) was finished long before I could perswade my self to let it come into Publike View. And this was caused partly by my own <hi>Backwardness</hi> to deal with these men, whom I have ever observed to be great Pretenders for <hi>Truth,</hi> and <hi>Unity,</hi> but yet such as will admit neither, unless <hi>They</hi> and their <hi>Faction</hi> may prevail in all; As if no <hi>Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:62620:4"/>
had been necessary. And <hi>partly</hi> because there were about the same time <hi>three Conferences</hi> held with <hi>Fisher.</hi> Of these, this was the <hi>Third;</hi> And could not therefore conveniently come abroad into the world, till the two former were ready to lead the way; which till that time, they were not.</p>
            <p>And this is in part the Reason also, why this <hi>Tract</hi> crept into the end of a larger Work. For since that Work contained in a manner the substance of all that passed in the <hi>two former Conferences:</hi> And that this third in divers points concurred with them, and depended on them; I could not think it <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantive</hi> enough, to stand alone. But besides this <hi>Affinity</hi> between the Conferences, I was willing to have it pass as silently as it might, at the end of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Work, and so perhaps little to be looked after, because I could not hold it worthy, nor can I yet, of that Great Duty, and Service, which I owe to my Dear Mother, the <hi>Church of England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is a cause also, why it looks now abroad again with <hi>Alteration</hi> and <hi>Addition.</hi> And 'tis fit I should give your <hi>Majesty</hi> an Account of that too. This <hi>Tract</hi> was first printed in the year 1624. And in the year 1626, another <hi>Jesuite,</hi> or the same, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the name of <hi>A. C.</hi> printed a Relation of this <hi>Conference,</hi> and therein took Exceptions to some Particulars, &amp; endeavoured to Confute some Things deliver'd therein by me. Now being in years, and unwilling to die in the <hi>Jesuites</hi> debt, I have in this <hi>Second Edition</hi> done as much for him, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what more. For he did but skip up and down, and
<pb facs="tcp:62620:5"/>
labour to pick a hole, here, and there, where he thought he might fasten; and where it was too hard for him, let it alone. But I have gone <hi>through</hi> with him; And I hope, given a full Confutation: or at least such a <hi>Bone</hi> to gnaw, as may shake his teeth, if he look not to it. And of my <hi>Addition to this Discourse,</hi> this is the Cause; But of my <hi>Alteration</hi> of some things in it, this. <hi>A. C.</hi> his Curiosity to <hi>winnow</hi> me, made me in a more curious manner fall to sifting of my self, and that which had formerly past my <hi>Pen.</hi> And though (I bless God for it) I found no cause to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter any thing that belonged either to the <hi>Substance,</hi> or <hi>Course</hi> of the Conference: Yet somewhat I did find, which needed better, and <hi>cleerer expression;</hi> And that I have <hi>altered,</hi> well knowing I must expect <hi>Curious Observers</hi> on all hands.</p>
            <p>Now, Why this <hi>Additional Answer</hi> to the <hi>Relation</hi> of <hi>A C.</hi> came no sooner forth, hath a Cause too, and I shall truly represent it. <hi>A. C. his Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Conference,</hi> was set out, 1626. I knew not of it in some years after. For it was prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted among divers other things of like nature, either by M. <hi>Fisher</hi> himself, or his friend <hi>A. C.</hi> When I saw it, I read it over carefully, and found my self not a little wrong'd in it; but the <hi>Church of England,</hi> and indeed the <hi>Cause of Religion,</hi> much more. I was before this time by <hi>Your Majesties Great Grace,</hi> and undeserved favour, made <hi>Dean of Your Majesties Chappel Royal,</hi> and a <hi>Counsellor of State,</hi> and hereby, as the Occasions of those times were, made too much a Stranger to my <hi>Books.</hi> Yet

And while the one faction cryes up the <hi>Church</hi> above the <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;</hi> and the other the <hi>Scripture</hi> to the neglect and Contempt of the <hi>Church,</hi> which the <hi>Scripture</hi> it self teaches men both to honour, and obey: They have so far endangered the <hi>Belief</hi> of the One, and the <hi>Authority</hi> of the Other, as that neither hath its <hi>Due</hi> from a great part of Men. Whereas according to <hi>Christs Institution:</hi> The <hi>Scripture,</hi> where 'tis plain, should guide the <hi>Church;</hi> And the <hi>Church,</hi> were there's Doubt or Difficulty, should
<pb facs="tcp:62620:10"/>
expound the <hi>Scripture;</hi> Yet so, as neither the <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> should be forced, nor the Church so bound up, as that upon Just and farther Evidence, She may not revise that which in any Case hath slipt by Her. What Success this <hi>Great Distemper</hi> caused by the Collision of two such <hi>Factions,</hi> may have, I know not, I cannot <hi>Prophesie.</hi> This I know, That the use which Wise men should make of other mens <hi>falls,</hi> is not to fall with with them; And the use which <hi>Pious and Religious men</hi> should make of these great <hi>Flaws in Christianity,</hi> is not to <hi>Joyn</hi> with them that make them, nor to help to dislocate those main <hi>Bones</hi> in the <hi>Body,</hi> which being once put out of <hi>Joynt,</hi> will not easily be set again. And though I cannot <hi>Prophesie,</hi> yet I fear That <hi>Atheism,</hi> and <hi>Irreligion</hi> gather strength, while the <hi>Truth</hi> is thus weakned by an <hi>Unworthy way</hi> of Contending for it. And while they thus Contend, neither part Consider, that they are in a way to induce upon themselvs, and others, that <hi>Contrary Extream,</hi> which they seem most both to <hi>fear,</hi> and <hi>oppose.</hi>

               <hi>Besides:</hi> This I have ever Observed, That many <hi>Rigid Professors</hi> have turn'd <hi>Roman Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholiks,</hi> and in that Turn have been <hi>more Jesui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi> than any other: And such <hi>Romanists</hi> as have chang'd from them, have for the most part quite lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped over the <hi>Mean,</hi> and been as <hi>Rigid</hi> the other way, as <hi>Extremity</hi> it self. And this is there be not both <hi>Grace,</hi> and <hi>Wisdom</hi> to govern it, is a very <hi>Natural Motion.</hi> For a man is apt to think he can never run far enough from that, which he
<pb facs="tcp:62620:11"/>
once begins to hate; And doth not Consider therewhile, That where <hi>Religion Corrupted</hi> is the thing he hates, a <hi>Fallacy</hi> may easily be put upon him. For he ought to hate the <hi>Corruption</hi> which depraves <hi>Religion,</hi> and to run from it: but from <hi>no part of Religion</hi> it self, which he ought to Love, and Reverence, ought he to depart. And this I have <hi>Observed</hi> farther: That no one thing hath made <hi>Conscientious men</hi> more waver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in their own mindes, or more apt, and easie to be drawn aside from the sincerity of <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion professed in the Church of England,</hi> than the Want of <hi>Uniform</hi> and <hi>Decent Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> in too many Churches of the <hi>Kingdom.</hi> And the <hi>Romanists</hi> have been apt to say, <hi>The Houses of God</hi> could not be suffer'd to lye so <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stily</hi> (as in some places they have done) were the <hi>True worship of God</hi> observed in them: Or did the People think that such it were. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>istrue, the <hi>Inward Worship</hi> of the Heart, is the <hi>Great Service of God,</hi> and no Service acceptable with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it: But the <hi>External worship of God</hi> in his Church is the <hi>Great Witness</hi> to the World, that Our heart stands right in that <hi>Service of God.</hi> Take this away, or bring it into Contempt, and <hi>what Light is there left to shine before men, that they may see our Devotion, and glorifie our Father which is in Heaven?</hi> And to deal clearly with <hi>Your Majesty,</hi> These <hi>Thoughts</hi> are they, and no other, which have made me labour so much, as I have done, for <hi>Decency</hi> and an
<pb facs="tcp:62620:11"/>
Orderly settlement of the <hi>External Worship of God in the Church.</hi> For of that which is <hi>Inward</hi> there can be no <hi>Witness</hi> among men, nor no <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample</hi> for men. Now no External Action in the world can be <hi>Uniform</hi> without some <hi>Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies.</hi> And these in <hi>Religion,</hi> the <hi>Ancienter</hi> they be, the better, so they may fit <hi>Time</hi> and <hi>Place. Too many</hi> Over-burden the <hi>Service of God;</hi> And <hi>too</hi> few leave it naked. And scarce any Thing hath hurt <hi>Religion</hi> more in these broken Times, than an Opinion in too many men, That because <hi>Rome</hi> had thrust some Unnecessary, and many Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitious Ceremonies upon the Church, therefore the <hi>Reformation</hi> must have none at all; Not considering therewhile, That <hi>Ceremonies</hi> are the <hi>Hedge</hi> that fence the <hi>Substance of Religion</hi> from all the Indignities, which <hi>Prophaneness</hi> and <hi>Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi> too Commonly put upon it. And a Great Weakness it is, not to see the strength which <hi>Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies</hi> (Things weak enough in themselves, God knows) adde even to <hi>Religion</hi> it self; But a far greater to see it, and yet to Cry Them down, all, and without Choyce, by which their most hated Adversaries climb'd up, and could not crie up them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and their Cause, as they do, but by them. And <hi>Divines</hi> of all the rest might learn, and teach this <hi>Wisdom</hi> if they would, since they see all other <hi>Professions,</hi> which help to bear down their <hi>Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies,</hi> keep up their own therewhile, and that to the highest.</p>
            <p>I have been too bold to detain <hi>Your Majesty</hi> so

long; But my Grief to see <hi>Christendom</hi> bleeding in Dissention, and which is worse, triumphing in her own Blood, and most angry with them, that would study her <hi>Peace,</hi> hath thus transported me.

But then this Priviledge of not erring dangerously in the Faith, was not made over absolutely to the <hi>Romans,</hi> that are such by <hi>Birth,</hi> and dwelling only; but to the <hi>Romans, qua tales,</hi> as they were such as those first were, <hi>whose Faith was famous through the World,</hi> and as long as they continued such; which at that time it seems they did. And so S. <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s words seem to import, <hi>eos esse Romanos,</hi> that the <hi>Romans</hi> then under Pope <hi>Cornelius,</hi> were such as the <note n="*" place="margin">Rom. 1. 8.</note> 
                  <hi>Apostle</hi> spake of; and therefore to whom at that time (or any time, they still remaining such) <hi>perfidious misbelief</hi> could not be welcom; or rather indeed, <hi>perfidious Misbelievers</hi> or <hi>Schisma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks</hi> could not be welcom. For this very Phrase, <hi>Perfidia non potest habere accessum,</hi> directs us to understand the word in a Concrete sense: <hi>Perfidiousness could not get access,</hi> that is, <hi>such perfidious persons,</hi> Excommunicated out of other Churches, were not likely to get access at <hi>Rome,</hi> or to finde admittance into their Communion: It is but a <hi>Metonymie</hi> of speech, the <hi>Adjunct</hi> for the <hi>Subject,</hi> a thing very usual in <hi>Elegant</hi>

                  <hi>were translated by him, and delivered to the simple people of the</hi> Church <hi>of</hi> Rome, <hi>that by his means they might loose the verity of the Faith, which they had learned from the Apostle.</hi> Therefore the <hi>Praestigiae</hi> before-mentioned, were the cunning illusions of <hi>Ruffinus,</hi> putting <hi>Origen</hi>'s Book under the Martyr <hi>Pamphilus</hi> his name, that so he might bring in <hi>Heresie</hi> the more cunningly under a name of Credit, and the more easily pervert the peoples Faith. So, of the <hi>Faith</hi> he speaks. And secondly, I shall as easily confess that S. <hi>Jerom</hi>'s speech is most true, but I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not admit the <hi>Cardinal</hi>'s sense of it: for he imposes upon the word <hi>Fides.</hi> For by <hi>Romana Fides,</hi> the <hi>Roman Faith,</hi> he will understand the <hi>particular Church of Rome;</hi> which is as much as to say, <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manos Fideles,</hi> the Faithful of that Church: And that no wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly delusions, or cousenage in matter of Faith can be imposed upon them.

For <hi>Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na Fides,</hi> the <hi>Roman Faith,</hi> as it was commended by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle (of which S. <hi>Jerome</hi> speaks) is one thing; and the <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Roman Church,</hi> of which the <hi>Cardinal</hi> speaks, is another. The <hi>Faith</hi> indeed admits not <hi>Praestigias,</hi> wily delusions into it; if it did, it could not be the <hi>whole and undefiled Faith of Christ,</hi> which they learned from the <hi>Apostle;</hi> and which is so fenced by <hi>Apostolical Authority,</hi> as that it cannot be changed, though an Angel should preach the contrary. But the <hi>Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Church of Rome</hi> hath admitted <hi>Praestigias,</hi> divers crafty Conveyances into the <hi>Faith,</hi> and is not fenced, as the <hi>Faith it self</hi> is. And therefore though an <hi>Angel</hi> cannot contrary that, yet the <hi>bad Angel</hi> hath sowed Tares in this. By which means <hi>Romana Fides,</hi> though it be now the same it was for the <hi>words</hi> of the <hi>Creed;</hi> yet it is not the same for the <hi>sense</hi> of it: nor for the <hi>super</hi> and <hi>praeter-structures</hi> built upon it, or joyned unto it. So the <hi>Roman Faith,</hi> that is, the <hi>Faith</hi> which S. <hi>Paul</hi> taught the <hi>Romans,</hi> and after commended in them, was all one with the <hi>Catholike Faith of Christ.</hi> For S. <hi>Paul</hi> taught no other then that <hi>One;</hi> and this one can never be changed in, or from it self, by <hi>Angel</hi> or <hi>Devil.</hi> But in mens hearts it may receive a change; and in particular Churches it may receive a change; and in the <hi>particular Church of Rome</hi> it hath received a change. And ye see S. <hi>Hierome</hi> himself confesses, that the <hi>Pope</hi> himself was afraid <note n="†" place="margin">Ne fidei ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritatem quam ab Apostolo didicerant, per te perderent, <hi>ut suprà.</hi>

                  <hi>ne perderent,</hi> lest by this Art of <hi>Ruffinus,</hi> the <hi>people might lose the verity of the Faith.</hi> Now that which can be lost, can be changed: For usually Habits begin to alter, before they be quite <hi>lost.</hi> And that which may be lost among the <hi>People,</hi> may be lost among the <hi>Bishops,</hi> and the rest of the <hi>Clergy</hi> too, if they look not to it, as it seems they after did not at <hi>Rome,</hi> though then they did. Nay, at this time the whole <hi>Roman Church</hi> was in danger enough to swallow <hi>Origen</hi>'s <hi>Book,</hi> and all the Errours in it, coming under the name of <hi>Pamphilus:</hi> And so S. <hi>Hierome</hi> himself expresly, and close upon the place cited by <hi>Bellarmine.</hi> For he desires <note n="*" place="margin">Muta titu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum, &amp; Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam simplici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatem tanto periculo libera. <hi>Ibid.</hi> fol. 84.

                  <hi>Ruffinus</hi> his words then run thus: <hi>Before I come to the words of the Creed, this I think sit to warn you of, that in divers Churches some things are found added to the words</hi> (of the Creed.) <hi>But in the Church of the City of</hi> Rome, <hi>this is not found done: And as I think, it is, for that no Heresie did take its rise or beginning there: And for that the Old Custom is there observed, namely, that they which are to receive the grace of Baptism, do publickly repeat the Creed in the hearing of the people, who would not admit such Additions. But in other places (as far as I can understand) by reason of some Hereticks, some things were added, but such as were to exclude the sense of their Novel Doctrine.</hi> Now these words make little for <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi> who cites them, and much against <hi>Ruffinus</hi> that uttered them. They make little for <hi>Bellarmine. First,</hi> because suppose <hi>Ruffinus</hi> his speech to be true, yet this will never follow: In <hi>Ruffinus</hi> his time no <hi>Heresie</hi> had taken its beginning at <hi>Rome:</hi> therefore no <hi>Heresie</hi> hath had rooting there so many hundred years since. <hi>Secondly, Bellarmine</hi> takes upon him there to prove, <hi>That the particular Church of</hi> Rome <hi>cannot Erre.</hi> Now neither can this be concluded out of <hi>Ruffinus</hi> his words. First, because (as I said before) to argue from <hi>Non sumpsit,</hi> to <hi>Ergo sumere non potest:</hi> No <hi>Heresie</hi> hath yet begun there; therefore none can begin there, or spring thence, is an Argument drawn <hi>ab Actu ad Potentiam negative,</hi> from the Act to the Power of Being; which every Novice in Learning can tell proceeds not <hi>Negatively.</hi> And common reason tells every man, 'tis no consequence to say, Such a thing is not, or hath not been, therefore it cannot be. <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,</hi> because though it were true, that no <hi>Heresie</hi> at all did ever take its beginning at <hi>Rome,</hi> yet that can never prove, <hi>that the particular Church of</hi> Rome <hi>can never Erre</hi> (which is the thing in Question.) For suppose that no <hi>Heresie</hi> did ever begin there, yet if any that began elsewhere were admitted into that Church, it is as full a proof, <hi>that that Church can Erre,</hi> as if the <hi>Heresie</hi> had been hatched in that Nest. For that Church
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:62620:18"/>
erres, which admits an <hi>Heresie</hi> in it, as well as that which <hi>broa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches</hi> it. Now <hi>Ruffinus</hi> says no more of the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> then <hi>non sumpsit exordium,</hi> no Heresie took its beginning there; but that denies not, but that some Heretical Taint might get in there: And 'tis more then manifest, that the most famous Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies, in their several times, made their abode even at <hi>Rome.</hi> And 'tis observable too, that <hi>Bellarmine</hi> cites no more of <hi>Ruffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> his words then these (<hi>In Ecclesia Urbis</hi> Romae <hi>neque Haeresis ulla sumpsit exordium, &amp; mos ibi servatur antiquus</hi>) as if this were an entire speech, whereas it comes in but as a Reason gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of the speech precedent; and as if <hi>Ruffinus</hi> made the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> the great Observer of the Customs of the Church, whereas he speaks but of one particular Custom of <hi>reciting the Creed before Baptism.</hi> But after all this, I pray did no <hi>Heresie</hi> ever begin at <hi>Rome?</hi> Where did <hi>Novatianism</hi> begin?

It must needs <hi>ordinarily</hi> have <hi>Tradition,</hi> to prepare the mind of a man to receive it. And in the next place, where he speaks so sensibly, That <hi>Scripture</hi> cannot bear witness to it self, nor one part of it to another; that is grounded upon <hi>Nature,</hi> which admits no created thing to be witness to it self; and is acknowledged by our Saviour, <note n="‖" place="margin">S.

His words are, <hi>So that unless, besides Scripture, there be,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Besides Scripture;</hi> therefore he excludes not <hi>Scripture,</hi> though he call for another Proof to lead it in, and help in assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, namely, <hi>Tradition,</hi> which no man, that hath his brains about him, denies. In the two other Places, <hi>Brierly</hi> falsifies shamefully; for folding up all that <hi>Hooker</hi> says, in these words; <hi>This</hi> (other means to assure us besides <hi>Scripture</hi>) <hi>is the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of Gods Church;</hi> he wrinkles that <hi>Worthy Author</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperately, and shrinks up his meaning.

                  <hi>Spirit of God</hi> inwardly inclining our hearts, and sealing the full <hi>Assurance</hi> of the sufficiencie of all <hi>Three</hi> unto us. And then, and not before, we are certain, <hi>That the Scripture is the Word of God</hi> boty by <hi>Divine,</hi> and by <hi>Infallible</hi> Proof.

               <p>I have said thus much upon this great Occasion, because this <hi>Argument</hi> is so much pressed, without due respect to Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. And I have proceeded in a <hi>Synthetical way,</hi> to build up the <hi>Truth</hi> for the benefit of the <hi>Church,</hi> and the satisfaction of all men Christianly disposed.

the <hi>Question,</hi> thus: How do you know the Testimony of the Church (by which, you say, you know <hi>Scripture to be the Word of God</hi>) to be <hi>Divine</hi> and <hi>Infallible?</hi> If they prove it by <hi>Scripture</hi> (as all of them do, and as <hi>A. C.</hi> doth) how do<note place="margin">A. C. p. 53. Et vid. §. 16. N. 28.</note> they know <hi>that Scripture</hi> to be Scripture? It is but a <hi>Circular Assurance</hi> of theirs, by which they found the <hi>Churches Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility</hi> upon the <hi>Testimony of the Scripture;</hi> And the <hi>Scriptures Infallibility</hi> upon the <hi>Testimony of the Church:</hi> That is upon the Matter, the <hi>Churches Infallibility</hi> upon the <hi>Churches Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility.</hi> But I labour for edification, not for destruction.

The time was, before this <hi>miserable Rent</hi> in the Church of Christ (which I think no true Christian can look upon, but with a bleeding heart) that you and We were all of <hi>One Belief:</hi> That belief was tainted, in tract and corruption of times, very deeply.

Of these, this was one of the greatest, <note n="*" place="margin">Inter omnes penè constat aut certè id quod satis est, inter me &amp; il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>los, cum qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus nunc agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur, convenit hoc, &amp;c.

                  <hi>That the Scripture is the Word of God;</hi> For our belief of all things contained in it, depends upon it.

                  <hi>Satis superque,</hi> enough and more than enough; which your selves have not done, do not. And for begetting and setling a Belief of this Principle, we go the <hi>same way</hi> with you, and a <hi>better</hi> besides. <hi>The same way with you:</hi> Because we allow the <hi>Tradition</hi> of the present Church to be the <hi>first inducing Motive</hi> to embrace this <hi>Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;</hi> only we cannot go so far in this way as you, to make the present <hi>Tradition</hi> always an <hi>Infallible Word of God unwritten:</hi> For this is to go so far in, till you be out of the way. For <hi>Tradition</hi> is but a <hi>Lane</hi> in the Church; it hath an end, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to receive us in, but another after, to let us out, into more open, and richer ground. <hi>And we go a better way than you:</hi> Because after we are moved, and prepared, and induced by <hi>Tradition,</hi> we resolve our Faith into that Written Word, and God delivering it; in which we find <hi>materially,</hi> though not in <hi>Terms,</hi> the very <hi>Tradition,</hi> that led us thither. And so we are sure by Divine Authority that we are in the way, because at the end we find the way proved. And do what can be done, you can never settle the Faith of man about this great Principle, till you rise to greater assurance, than the Present Church alone can give. And therefore once again to that known place of <hi>S. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine:</hi>

therefore it is not likely that these places should serve alike for all. The first Place is Saint <hi>Matthew</hi> 16. There Christ told<note place="margin">S.

But the Promise reaches not to this, that the Church shall never Erre, no not in the lightest matters of <hi>Farth,</hi> For it will not follow: Hell-Gates shall not prevail against the Church; Therefore <hi>Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish Devils</hi> shall not tempt, or assault, and batter it.

The only Difficulty was to accommodate the <hi>Places</hi> and <hi>Precedencies</hi> of Bishops, among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, for the very Necessity of <hi>Order</hi> and <hi>Government.</hi> To do this, the most equal and impartial way was, <hi>That as the Church is in the Common-wealth, not the Common-wealth in it</hi> (as <note n="†" place="margin">Non enim Resp. est in Ecclesia: sed Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesia in Repub. <hi>Optat.</hi>

It was thought fit therefore, though (as <note n="*" place="margin">S. <hi>Cyprian.</hi> L. de Simp.

                  <hi>To this Church</hi> (he speaks of <hi>Rome</hi>) propter potentiorem prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipalitatem, <hi>for the more powerful Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pality of it, 'tis necessary that every Church, that is, the faithful,</hi> undique, <hi>round about, should have recourse. Should have recourse,</hi> so <hi>A. C.</hi> translates it. And what doth this avail him? Very<note place="margin">A. C. p. 58.</note> great reason was there in <hi>Irenaeus</hi> his time, That upon any <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference</hi> arising in the <hi>Faith, Omnes undique Fideles,</hi> all the Faithful, or, if you will, all the Churches round about, should have recourse, that is, resort to <hi>Rome,</hi> being the <hi>Imperial Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> and so a Church of <hi>more powerful Principality,</hi> than any other at that time in those parts of the world. Well: Will this exalt <hi>Rome</hi> to be the Head of the Church Universal? What if the <hi>States</hi> and <hi>Policies</hi> of the world be much changed since, and this Conveniencie of <hi>resorting to Rome</hi> be quite cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed? Then is not <hi>Rome</hi> devested of her <hi>more powerful Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pality?</hi> But the meaning of <hi>A. C.</hi> is, We must so have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course to <hi>Rome,</hi> as to submit our <hi>Faith</hi> to hers: And then not only in <hi>Irenaeus</hi> his time, but through all times reform Our selves by <hi>her Rule:</hi> That is, all the Faithful, not <hi>undique,</hi> round about, but <hi>ubique,</hi> every where, must agree with <hi>Rome</hi> in point of Faith. This he means, and <hi>Rome</hi> may thank him for it. But this <hi>Irenaeus</hi> saith not, nor will his words bear it; nor durst <hi>A. C.</hi> therefore construe him so, but was content to smooth it o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver with this ambiguous phrase of <hi>having recourse to Rome.</hi> Yet this is a place as much stood upon by them, as any other in all Antiquity. And should I grant them their own sense, <hi>That all the faithful every where must agree with Rome</hi> (which I may give, but can never grant) yet were not this saying any whit prejudicial to us now. For first, here's a <hi>powerful Principality</hi> ascribed to the <hi>Church of Rome.</hi> And <hi>that</hi> no man of Learning doubts but the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> had within its own <hi>Patriar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chate</hi> and <hi>Jurisdiction;</hi> and that was very large, containing <note n="‖" place="margin">

he did, and being of <hi>Italy,</hi> as he was, he might very well know the <hi>Bounds</hi> of that <hi>Patriarchs</hi> Jurisdiction, as it was then practised: <note n="*" place="margin">Apud <hi>Alexandriam,</hi> ut in urbe <hi>Româ</hi> vetusta consuetudo servetur, ut ille <hi>Aegyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti,</hi> ut hic Suburbicariarum Ecclesiarum so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitudinem gerat. <hi>Ruffin.</hi> L. 1.

                  <hi>Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Peron</hi> lays load upon <hi>Ruffinus.</hi> For he charges him with Passion, Ignorance, and Rashness. And one piece of his Ignorance is, That he hath ill translated the <hi>Canon of the Councel of Nice.</hi> Now be that as it may, I neither do, nor can approve his <hi>Translation</hi> of that Canon; nor can it be easily proved, that he purposely intended a Translation. All that I urge is, that <hi>Ruffinus</hi> living in that time and Place, was very like well to know and understand the Limits and Bounds of that <hi>Patriarchate of Rome,</hi> in which he lived. Secondly here's, That it had <hi>potentiorem,</hi> a more <hi>powerful Principality</hi> than other <hi>Churches</hi> had. And that the <hi>Protestants</hi> grant too; and that not only because the <hi>Roman Prelate</hi> was <hi>Ordine pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,</hi> first in Order, and <hi>Degree,</hi> which some <hi>One</hi> must be, to avoid Confusion; <note n="‖" place="margin">Quia cùm Orientales &amp; Graecae Ecclesiae, &amp; Africanae etiam, multis inter se Opinio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num dissentionibus tumultuare<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>But also because the Roman Sea had won a great deal of Credit, and gained a great deal of Power to it self in Church-Affairs: Because while the Greek yea, and the African Churches too, were tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulent, and distracted with many and dangerous Opinions, the Church of Rome all that while, and a good while after</hi> Irenaeus <hi>too, was more calm and constant to the Truth.</hi> Thirdly, here's a Necessity (say they) required, That <hi>every Church,</hi> that is, the faithful, which are every where, agree with <hi>that Church.</hi> But what? simply with that <hi>Church,</hi> what ever it do or believe? No, nothing less. For <hi>Irenaeus</hi> adds, <hi>with that Church,</hi> in quâ, <hi>in which is conserved that Tradition which was delivered by the Apostles.</hi> And God forbid but it should be necessary for <hi>all Churches;</hi> and <hi>all the faithful</hi> to agree with that <hi>Ancient Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolike Church</hi> in all those Things, in which it keeps to the <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and Discipline delivered by the Apostles.</hi> In <hi>Iraeneus</hi> his time it kept these better than any other Church, and by this in part obtained <hi>potentiorem Principalitatem,</hi> a Greater power <hi>than</hi> other Churches, but not <hi>over</hi> all other Churches. And (as they understand <hi>Irenaeus</hi>) a Necessity lay upon all other Churches to agree with this: but this Necessity was laid upon them by the <hi>Then Integrity of the Christian Faith there profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, not by the Universality of the Roman Jurisdiction now challenged.</hi> And let <hi>Rome</hi> reduce it self to the <hi>Observation of Tradition Apostolike,</hi> to which it then held, and I will say as <hi>Irenaeus</hi> did; <hi>That it will be then necessary for every Church,</hi>
                  <pb n="121" facs="tcp:62620:73"/>
                  <hi>and for the Faithful every where, to agree with it.</hi> Lastly, let me Observe too, That <hi>Irenaeus</hi> made no doubt, but that <hi>Rome</hi> might fall away from <hi>Apostolical Tradition,</hi> as well as other <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Churches</hi> of great <hi>Name</hi> have done. For he does not say, <hi>in quâ servanda semper erit, sed in quâ servata est:</hi> Not, in which Church the Doctrine delivered from the Apostles shall ever be entirely kept: That had been <hi>home</hi> indeed: But in which, by God's Grace and Mercy, it was to that time of <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renaeus</hi> so kept and preserved.

                  <hi>Gregory the Seventh</hi> had set the <hi>Popedom</hi> upon a broad bottom before this <hi>Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cents</hi> time. So that now 'tis the less wonder, if he make so bold with the <hi>Emperor,</hi> as to depress him as low as the <hi>Moon,</hi> upon no better ground, than a groundless Resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance. But beside this <hi>prime Reason,</hi> there are divers other, which may easily be drawn out of the same <hi>Resemblance.</hi> For since <hi>Innocentius</hi> his main aim was to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish the <hi>Popes</hi> greatness over <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors:</hi> Why doth he not tell us, That the <hi>Pope</hi> is as the <hi>Sun,</hi> and the <hi>Emperor</hi> as the <hi>Moon?</hi> Because as the <hi>Moon</hi> borrows all her light from the <hi>Sun:</hi> So the <hi>Emperor</hi> borrows all his true light from the <hi>Pope.</hi> Or because as the <hi>Moon</hi> still increases in light so long as she follows the <hi>Sun,</hi> but so soon as ever she steps before the <hi>Sun</hi> she waines presently, and her light decreases: So the <hi>Emperor,</hi> so long as he is content to follow the <hi>Pope,</hi> and do all that he would have him, his light, and his power, encrease; but if he do but offer to step before (though that be his proper place) then his light, and honour, and power, and all decrease. And this <hi>Pope Gregory the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth</hi> made too good upon the <hi>Emperour Henry the Third.</hi> And <hi>Pope Adrian the Fourth,</hi> and <hi>Alexander the Fourth,</hi> and <hi>Lucius the Third,</hi> with some others, upon <hi>Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derick Barbarossa.</hi> And some other <hi>Emperours</hi> were alike serv'd, where they did not submit.

Next, S. <hi>Augustine's</hi> Dispute is against S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> and the Councel held at <hi>Carthage</hi> about <hi>Baptism by Hereticks;</hi> in which Point, that <hi>National Councel</hi> erred (as now all agree.)

The words are plain, and the <hi>Non obstante</hi> must necessarily (for ought I can yet see) be referred to both Clauses in the words following, because both Clauses went before it, and hath as much force against Receiving under both kindes, as against Receiving after Supper.

For either the <hi>Fathers of the Church, Greek</hi> as well as <hi>Latine,</hi> knew this Proposition to be true, <hi>That the Pope cannot Erre Judicially in matters belonging to the Faith,</hi> or they knew it not.

                  <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine's</hi> own Opinion is, <hi>That if the Pope be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a manifest Heretick, he presently ceases to be Pope and Head of the Church, and may then be Judged and punished by the Church.

                  </note> This also is granted. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> He that is to be made <hi>Pope,</hi> can never be in <hi>Holy Orders,</hi> but by receiving them from One that hath <hi>Power to Ordain.</hi> This is notoriously known; So is it also, that with you <hi>Order is a Sacrament properly so called.</hi> And if so, then the <hi>Pope,</hi> when he did receive the <hi>Order of Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con,</hi> or <hi>Priesthood</hi> at the hands of the <hi>Bishop,</hi> did also receive a <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament.</hi> Upon these Grounds I raise my Argument, thus. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Church, nor any Member of the Church, can know that this <hi>Pope</hi> which now sits, or any other that hath been, or shall be, is <hi>Infallible.</hi> For he is not <hi>Infallible,</hi> unless he be <hi>Pope;</hi> and he is not <hi>Pope,</hi> unless he be in <hi>Holy Orders;</hi> And he cannot be so, unless he have received those <hi>Holy Orders,</hi> and that from one that had Power to Ordain; And those <hi>Holy Orders</hi> in your Doctrine are a <hi>Sacrament;</hi> And a <hi>Sacrament</hi> is not perfectly given, if he that Administers it have not <hi>intentionem faciendi quod facit Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sia,</hi> an intention to do that which the Church doth by <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi> Now who can possibly tell, that the <hi>Bishop</hi> which gave the <hi>Pope</hi> Orders, was <hi>first,</hi> a man <hi>qualified</hi> to give them; and <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,</hi> so devoutly set upon his Work, that he had, at the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant of giving them, an <hi>Intention</hi> and purpose to do therein as the Church doth? Surely none but that <hi>Bishop</hi> himself. And his testimony of himself, and his own Act, such especially as, if faulty, he would be loth to Confess, can neither give <hi>Knowledge</hi> nor <hi>Belief</hi> sufficient, that the <hi>Pope,</hi> according to this <hi>Canon,</hi> is in <hi>Holy Orders.</hi> So upon the Whole matter, let the <hi>Romanists</hi> take which they will (I will give them free Choice) either this <hi>Canon of the Councel of Trent</hi> is false Divinity, and there is no such <hi>Intention</hi> necessary to the <hi>Essence</hi> and <hi>Being</hi> of a <hi>Sacrament:</hi>
                  <pb n="179" facs="tcp:62620:102"/>
Or if it be true, it is impossible for any man to know, and for any advised man to Believe, <hi>That the Pope is Infallible in his Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial Sentences in things belonging to the Faith.</hi> And so here again a <hi>General Councel,</hi> at least such a one, as that of <hi>Trent</hi> is, can <hi>Erre,</hi> or the <hi>Pope</hi> is not Infallible.</p>

                  <hi>ut caeteros Theologos dede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rint in stuporem;</hi> as amazed the other Divines which were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent. And concluded, <hi>That no Internal Intention was required in the Minister of a Sacrament, but that Intention which did ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear</hi> Opere externo; <hi>in the Work it self performed by him: And that if he had unworthily any wandring thoughts, nay more, any contrary Intention within him, yet it neither did, nor could hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the blessed effect of any Sacrament.</hi> And most certain it is, if this be not true, besides all other Inconveniences, which are many, no man can secure himself upon any Doubt or trouble in his Conscience, that he hath truly and really been made partaker of any Sacrament whatsoever, No, not of Baptism; and so by Consequence be left in doubt whether he be a Christian or no, even after he is Baptized. Whereas 'tis most impossible, That <hi>Christ</hi> should so order his <hi>Sacraments,</hi> and so leave them to his <hi>Church,</hi> as that <hi>poor Believers in his Name,</hi> by any unworthiness of any of his <hi>Priests,</hi> should not be able to know whether they have received <hi>His Sacraments</hi> or not, even while they have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived them.

                  <hi>Bellarmine</hi> tells us <hi>No Pope hath done, or can do.</hi> And a <hi>Maxime</hi> it is with you, <hi>That a General Councel can erre, if it be confirmed by the Pope;</hi>

                  <hi>But if it be confirmed, then it cannot erre.</hi> Where <hi>first,</hi> this is very improper Language. For I hope no Councel is confirmed, till it be finished. And when 'tis finished, even before the <hi>Popes confirmation</hi> be put to it, either it hath Erred, or not Erred. If it have Erred, the <hi>Pope</hi> ought not to <hi>confirm</hi> it; and if he do, 'tis a <hi>void act.</hi> For no power can make Falshood Truth. If it have not Erred, then it was True be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Pope confirmed</hi> it. So his <hi>Confirmation</hi> addes nothing but his own <hi>Assent:</hi> Therefore his <hi>confirmation</hi> of a <hi>General Councel</hi> (as you will needs call it) is at the most <hi>Signum, non Causa;</hi> a <hi>Signe,</hi> and that such as may fail, but no <hi>Cause</hi> of the <hi>Councels</hi> not Erring. But then <hi>secondly,</hi> if a <hi>General Councel</hi> Confirmed (as you would have it) by the <hi>Pope</hi> have Erred, and so can Erre; then certainly the <hi>Pope</hi> can Erre <hi>Judicially.</hi> For he never gives a more <hi>solemn Sentence for Truth,</hi> than when he decrees any thing in a <hi>General Councel.</hi> Therefore if he have Erred, and can Erre there, then certainly he can Erre in his <hi>Definitive Sentence</hi> about the Faith, and is not <hi>Infallible.</hi> Now that he hath Erred, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore can Erre in a <hi>General Councel confirmed,</hi> in which he takes upon him to teach all <hi>Christendom,</hi> is most clear and evident.

                  <hi>Petilian</hi> the <hi>Donatist</hi> brag'd in the case of <hi>Baptism.</hi> But in truth, 'tis nothing. For the Syllogism, which it frames, is this. <hi>In Point of Faith and Salvation 'tis safest for a man to take that way, which the differing Parties agree on. But Papists and Protestants (which are the differing Parties) agree in this, that there is salvation possible to be found in the Roman Church. Therefore 'tis safest for a man to be, and continue in the Roman Church.</hi> To the <hi>Minor Proposition</hi> then; I observe this only, that though <hi>many</hi> Learned <hi>Protestants</hi> grant this, <hi>all</hi> do not. And then that Proposition is not <hi>Universally true,</hi> nor able to sustain the <hi>Conclusion.</hi> For they do not in this all agree; nay, I doubt not, but there are some <hi>Protestants,</hi> which can, and do as stifly, and as churlishly deny them <hi>Salvation,</hi> as they do us. And <hi>A. C.</hi> should do well to consider, whether they do it not upon as good reason at least. But for the <hi>Major Proposition;</hi> Namely, <hi>That in Point of Faith and Salvation, 'tis safest for a man to take that way, which the Adversary confesses, or the Differing Parties agree on.</hi> I say, that is no <hi>Metaphysical Principle,</hi> but a bare <hi>Contingent Proposition,</hi> and being indefinitely taken, may be <hi>true</hi> or <hi>false,</hi> as the matter is to which it is applied; but being taken universally, is false, and not able to lead in the <hi>Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</hi> Now that this Proposition <hi>(In point of Faith and Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, 'tis safest for a man to take that way, which the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Parties agree on, or which the Adversary confesses)</hi> hath no strength in it self, but is sometimes <hi>true,</hi> and sometimes <hi>false,</hi> as the <hi>Matter</hi> is, about which it is conversant, is most evident. <hi>First,</hi> by Reason: Because Consent of disagreeing Parties is neither <hi>Rule,</hi> nor <hi>Proof</hi> of <hi>Truth.</hi> For <hi>Herod</hi> and <hi>Pilate, disagreeing</hi>
                  <pb n="189" facs="tcp:62620:107"/>
                  <hi>Parties</hi> enough, yet agreed against <hi>Truth it self.</hi> But <hi>Truth</hi> rather is, or should be the <hi>Rule</hi> to frame, if not to force Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And <hi>secondly,</hi> by the two <hi>Instances</hi> 
                  <note n="†" place="margin">§. 35. <hi>N.</hi> 3.</note> 
                  <hi>before</hi> given. For in the Instance between the <hi>Orthodox Church</hi> then, and the <hi>Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tists,</hi> this <hi>Proposition</hi> is most false; For it was a Point of <hi>Faith,</hi> &amp; so of <hi>Salvation,</hi> that they were upon, Namely, the right use and administration of the Sacrament of <hi>Baptism.</hi> And yet had it been safest to take up that way, which the differing Parts agreed on, or which the adverse Part Confessed, men must needs have gone with the <hi>Donatists</hi> against the <hi>Church.</hi> And this must fall out as oft as any <hi>Heretick</hi> will cunningly take that way against the <hi>Church,</hi> which the <hi>Donatists</hi> did, if this <hi>Principle</hi> shall go for currant. But in the <hi>second</hi> Instance, concerning the <hi>Eucharist,</hi> a matter of <hi>Faith,</hi> and so of <hi>Salvation</hi> too, the same <hi>Proposition</hi> is most true. And the <hi>Reason</hi> is, because <hi>here</hi> the <hi>matter</hi> is true; Namely, <hi>The true, and real participation of the Body and Blood of Christ in that Blessed Sacrament.</hi> But in the <hi>former</hi> the <hi>matter</hi> was false, Namely, That <hi>Rebaptization</hi> was necessary after <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptism</hi> formally given by the <hi>Church.</hi> So this Proposition <hi>(In Point of Faith and Salvation it is safest for a man to take that way, which the differing Parties agree in; or which the Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary confesses,)</hi> is, you see, both <hi>true</hi> and <hi>false,</hi> as men have cunning to apply it, and as the matter is, about which it is Conversant. And is therefore no <hi>Proposition</hi> able, or fit to settle a <hi>Conclusion</hi> in any sober mans minde, till the <hi>Matter</hi> contained un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it, be well scanned, and examined. And yet as much use as you would make of this Proposition to amaze the weak, your selves dare not stand to it, no not where the matter is undeniably true, as shall appear in divers Particulars beside this of the <hi>Eucharist.</hi>

And is this no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; Nay, is not this full, and home to the present case? For the present case is this, and no more. <hi>That it is safest taking that way of Belief which the differing Parties agree on: or which the Adversary Confesses.</hi> And in the second of those Cases concerning the <hi>Eucharist,</hi> your Proposition indeed is true, not by the Truth which it hath seen in it self, <hi>Metaphysically,</hi> and in <hi>Abstract,</hi> but onely in regard of the <hi>matter,</hi> to which it is applied; yet there you desert your own Proposition, where it is true. And is this nothing? Nay, is not this also full, and home to the present case, since it appears your Proposition is such as your selves dare not bide by, either when it is true, or
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:62620:108"/>
when it is false? For in the Case of <hi>Baptism</hi> administred by the <hi>Donatist,</hi> the <hi>Proposition</hi> is <hi>false,</hi> and you dare not bide by it, for <hi>Truths</hi> sake. And in the case of the <hi>Eucharist,</hi> the <hi>Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition</hi> is <hi>true,</hi> and yet you dare not bide by it, for the <hi>Church of Romes</hi> sake.

As for the <hi>Learned</hi> of those <hi>zealous</hi> men that died in this Cause in Q. <hi>Maries</hi> days, they denied not the <hi>Real presence</hi> simply taken, but as their <hi>Opposites</hi> forced <hi>Transubstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation</hi> upon them, as if <hi>that,</hi> and the <hi>Real pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence</hi> had been all one. Whereas all the <hi>Ancient Christians</hi> ever believed the one, and none but <hi>Modern</hi> and <hi>Superstitious Christians</hi> believe the other; if they do believe it: for I, for my part, doubt they do not.

And to such I dare not deny a <hi>Possibility of Salvation,</hi> for that which is <hi>Christs</hi> in them, though they hazzard themselves extremely by keeping so close to that, which is <hi>Superstition,</hi> and in the Case <hi>of I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages,</hi> comes too near <hi>Idolatry.</hi> Nor can <hi>A.

Therefore according to the former Rule, (and here in truth too) 'tis safest for a man to believe the Commemorative, the the Praising, and the Performing Sacrifice, and to offer them duely to God, and leave the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> in this Particular to her <hi>Superstitions,</hi> that I may say no more. And would the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> stand to <hi>A.

Now all other <hi>Divines,</hi> as well <hi>ancient</hi> as <hi>modern,</hi> and both the <hi>dissenting Churches</hi> also, agree in the two former; but many deny that the <hi>Intention</hi> of the <hi>Priest</hi> is necessary. Will <hi>A. C.</hi> hold his <hi>Rule, That 'tis safest to believe in a controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Point of Faith that which the dissenting Parties agree on, or which the Adverse Part Confesses?</hi> If he will not, then why should he press that, as a <hi>Rule</hi> to direct others, which he will not be guided by himself? And if he will, then he must go professedly against the <note n="*" place="margin">Concil. Trid. Sess. 7. Can. 11.</note>

               <p>My <hi>fifth</hi> Instance is: We say, and can easily prove there<note place="margin">Punct. 5.</note> are divers Errours, and some gross ones, in the <hi>Roman Missal.</hi> But I my self have heard some <hi>Jesuites</hi> confess, that in the <hi>Liturgie of the Church of England</hi> there's no positive Errour. And being pressed, why then they refused to come to our Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and serve God with us? They answered, they could not do it, Because though our <hi>Liturgie</hi> had in it nothing ill, yet it
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:62620:113"/>
wanted a great deal of that which was good, and was in their <hi>Service.</hi> Now here let <hi>A. C.</hi> consider again, Here is a plain <hi>Concession of the adverse Part:</hi> And both agree, there's no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in our <hi>Service,</hi> but that which is <hi>holy</hi> and <hi>good.</hi> What will the <hi>Jesuite</hi> or <hi>A. C.</hi> say to this? If he forsake his ground, then it is not safest in point of Divine Worship to joyn in Faith as the dissenting Parties agree, or to stand to the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries own Confession. If he be so hardy as to maintain it, then the <hi>English Liturgy</hi> is <hi>better,</hi> and <hi>safer</hi> to worship God by, than the <hi>Roman Mass.</hi> Which yet, I presume <hi>A. C.</hi> will not confess.</p>

Virgil, <hi>and others.</hi> Whereas <hi>first</hi> these words are express in a most fair, and ancient Manuscript of <hi>Gildas</hi> to be seen in Sir <hi>Rob. Cotton</hi>'s Study, if any doubt it. <hi>Secondly,</hi> these words are as express in the printed Edition of <hi>Gildas</hi> by <hi>Polyd.

And <hi>Lastly,</hi> whereas he says: The Protestants them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves confess so much, I must believe he is as false in this as in the former, till he name the <hi>Protestants</hi> to me, which do confess it.

Will the <hi>Father,</hi> and the <hi>Mother,</hi> God, and the Church, cast one Childe out, because another is angry with it? Or when did Christ give that power to an El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Sister, that She, and her <hi>Steward,</hi> the <hi>Bishop</hi> there, should thrust out what Childe she pleased? Especially when she her self is justly accused to have given the Offence that is taken in the House?

And sure it is so. For I have since spoken with D. <hi>White</hi> the late Reverend Bishop of <hi>Ely,</hi> and he avows this, and no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Answer. <hi>He was asked in the Conference between you, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Popish Errours were Fundamental? To this he gave an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, by distinction of the Persons which held and professed the Errours: Namely, that the Errours were Fundamental</hi> reductivè, <hi>by a Reducement, if they which embraced them did pertinaciously adhere to them, having sufficient means to be better informed: Nay farther, that they were</hi> materially, <hi>and in the very Kinde and Nature of them,</hi> Leaven, Dross, <note n="†" place="margin">1 Cor. 3. 12.</note> Hay, and Stubble. <hi>Yet he thought withal, that such as were misled by Education, or long Custom, or over-valuing the Soveraignty of the Romane Church, and did in simplicity of heart embrace them, might by their general Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and Faith in the Merit of Christ, attended with Charity, and other Vertues, finde mercy at God's hands. But that he should say</hi> signantèr, <hi>and expresly, That none either of yours, or your Fellows Errours were damnable, so long as you hold them not against Conscience, that he utterly disavows. You delivered nothing to extort such a Confession from him. And for your self,</hi>

                  <hi>he could observe but small love of Truth, few signes of Grace in you (as he told me:) Yet he will not presume to judge you, or your Salvation; It is the</hi>

For <hi>A. C.</hi> confesses, he did but <hi>gather,</hi> that this was Doctor <hi>White's</hi> Opinion. And what if he gathered that, which grew not there, nor thence? For suppose all the <hi>Premises</hi> true, yet no Cartrope can draw this <hi>Conclusion</hi> out of them. And then all <hi>A. C's</hi> la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour's lost.

White</hi> could not assigne any Church <hi>differing from the Romane,</hi> that did this; Yet this will not follow, that therefore the <hi>Romane</hi> did it. And that because there's more in the <hi>Conclusion,</hi> than in the <hi>Premises.</hi> For <hi>A. C's</hi> Conclusion is, <hi>That in D.</hi> White's <hi>Opinion</hi>
                  <note place="margin">A. C. p. 67.</note> 
                  <hi>the Roman Church held and taught in all Ages unchanged Faith in all Fundamental points.</hi> And so far perhaps the Conclusion may stand, taking <hi>Fundamental points</hi> in their literal sense, as they are expressed in <hi>Creeds,</hi> and approved <hi>Councels.</hi> But then he addes: <hi>And did not in any Age erre in any Point Fundamental.</hi> Now this can never follow out of the <hi>Premises</hi> before laid down. For say some one Church or other may still be Visible; And that Visible Church hold all Fundamental Points in all Ages; And no man be able to name another Church different from the <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> that hath done this; yet it follows not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <hi>That the Church of Rome did not erre in any Age in any Point Fundamental.</hi> For a Church may hold the <hi>Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Point literally,</hi> and as long as it stays there, be without control; and yet erre <hi>grosly, dangerously,</hi> nay <hi>damnably</hi> in the <hi>Exposition</hi> of it. And this is the <hi>Church of Rome's</hi> Case. For most true it is, it hath in all Ages maintained the Faith unchanged in the Expression of the <hi>Articles</hi> themselves; but it hath in the Exposition both of <hi>Creeds,</hi> and <hi>Councels,</hi> quite chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, and lost the sense, and the meaning of some of them. So the <hi>Faith</hi> is in many things Changed both for Life and Belief, and yet seems the same. Now that which deceives the World, is, That because the <hi>Bark</hi> is the same, men think this Old Decayed Tree, is as Sound as it was at first, and not Weather-beaten in any Age. But when they

                  <hi>no Infallible Rule of Faith, but Scripture onely, can be infallibly sure that they believe the same entire Scripture, and Creed, and the Four first General Councels, and in the same in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corrupted sense in which the Primitive Church believed?</hi> 'Tis just as I said. Here are many Questions in one, and I might easily be caught, would I answer in gross to them all together; but I shall go more distinctly to work. Well then; I admit no <hi>ordinary Rule</hi> left in the Church, of Divine and Infallible Verity, and so of Faith, but the <hi>Scripture.</hi> And I believe the entire Scripture, <hi>first</hi> by the <hi>Tradition</hi> of the Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Then</hi> by all other <hi>credible Motives,</hi> as is before expressed: And <hi>last</hi> of all, by the <hi>light</hi> which shines in the Scripture it self, kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled in Believers by the <hi>Spirit of God.</hi> Then I believe the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire Scripture <hi>Infallibly,</hi> and by a <hi>Divine Infallibility</hi> am sure of my <hi>Object:</hi> Then am I as sure of my <hi>Believing,</hi> which is the <hi>Act</hi> of my <hi>Faith,</hi> conversant about this <hi>Object:</hi> For no man <hi>believes,</hi> but he must needs know in himself whether he <hi>believes</hi> or no, and wherein, and how far he doubts. Then I am Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly assured of my <hi>Creed,</hi> the <hi>Tradition</hi> of the Church indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing, and the <hi>Scripture</hi> confirming it. And I believe both <hi>Scripture</hi> and <hi>Creed</hi> in the same uncorrupted sense which the Primitive Church believed them; and am <hi>sure</hi> that I do so <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve</hi> them, because I cross not in my <hi>Belief</hi> any thing delivered by the <hi>Primitive Church.</hi> And this again I am sure of, because I take the Belief of the <hi>Primitive Church,</hi> as it is expressed, and delivered by the <hi>Councels,</hi> and <hi>Ancient Fathers</hi> of those times. As for the <hi>Four Councels,</hi> if <hi>A. C.</hi> ask how I have them, that is, their true and entire Copies? I answer, I have them from the <hi>Church-Tradition</hi> onely: And that's Assurance enough for this. And so I am fully as sure as <hi>A. C.</hi> is, or can make me. But if he ask how I know infallibly I believe them in their <hi>true and uncorrupted sense?</hi> Then I answer, There's no man of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, but he can understand the plain and simple Decision ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed in the <hi>Canon</hi> of the <hi>Councel,</hi> where 'tis necessary to Salvation. And for all other <hi>debates</hi> in the <hi>Councels,</hi> or <hi>Deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions</hi> of it in things of less moment, 'tis not necessary that I, or any man else, have <hi>Infallible Assurance</hi> of them; though I think 'tis possible to attain, even in these things, as much <hi>Infallible Assurance</hi> of the uncorrupted sense of them, as <hi>A. C.</hi> or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Jesuites</hi> have.</p>

                  <hi>A. C.</hi> asks again, <hi>What Text of Scripture tells, That Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants now living do believe all this, or that all this is expressed</hi>
                  <note place="margin">A. C. p. 69.</note> 
                  <hi>in those particular Bibles, or in the Writings of the Fathers and Councels, which now are in the Protestants hands?</hi> Good God! Whither will not a strong Bias carry even a learned Judgment!
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:62620:121"/>
Why, what Consequence is there in this? The Scripture now is the onely Ordinary <hi>Infallible Rule</hi> of Divine Faith, There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Protestants</hi> cannot believe all this before mentioned, unless a particular Text of <hi>Scripture</hi> can be shewed for it. Is it not made plain <hi>before,</hi> how we believe Scripture to be <hi>Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,</hi> and by Divine and <hi>Infallible Faith</hi> too, and yet we can shew no particular <hi>Text</hi> for it? Beside, were a <hi>Text of Scripture</hi> necessary, yet that is for the <hi>Object</hi> and the thing which we are to believe, not for the <hi>Act</hi> of our believing, which is meerly from God, and in our selves, and for which we cannot have any <hi>Warrant</hi> from, or by <hi>Scripture,</hi> more than that we ought to believe; but not that we in our particular do believe. The rest of the Question is far more inconsequent, <hi>VVhether all this be expressed in the Bibles which are in Protestants hands?</hi> For <hi>first,</hi> we have the same <hi>Bibles</hi> in our hands, which the <hi>Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nists</hi> have in theirs; Therefore either we are Infallibly sure of ours, or they are not Infallibly sure of theirs; For we have the same <hi>Book,</hi> and delivered unto us by the same hands; and all is expressed in ours, that is in theirs. Nor is it of moment in this Argument, that we account more <hi>Apocryphal</hi> than they do; For I will acknowledge every <hi>Fundamental point of Faith</hi> as proveable out of the <hi>Canon,</hi> as we account it, as if the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cryphal</hi> were added unto it. <hi>Secondly, A. C.</hi> is here extreamly out of himself, and his way; For his Question is, <hi>VVhether all this be expressed in the Bibles which we have? All this?</hi> All what? Why, before there is mention of the <hi>four General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels;</hi> and in this Question here's mention of the <hi>Writings of the Fathers and the Councels.</hi> And what, will <hi>A. C.</hi> look that we must shew a Text of Scripture for all this, and an express one too? I thought, and do so still, 'tis enough to ground Belief upon <note n="*" place="margin">Non potest aliquid certum esse certitudine Fidei, nisi aut immediatè contineatur in Verbo Dei: aut ex Verbo Dei per evidentem Consequentiam de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducatur. <hi>Bellar.</hi> L. 3. de Justif. c. 8. §. 2.</note>

Therefore <hi>Purgatory</hi> is not to be believed as a Doctrine delivered by <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postolical Authority,</hi> by <hi>Bellarmine's</hi> own rule; For it hath a <hi>Beginning. Thirdly,</hi> I observe too, that <hi>Bellarmine</hi> cannot well tell where to lay the <hi>foundation</hi> of <hi>Purgatory,</hi> that it may be safe. For <hi>first,</hi> he labours to found it upon <hi>Scripture.</hi> To that end <note n="†" place="margin">

                  <hi>he brings no fewer then ten places out of the Old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and nine out of the New,</hi> to prove it.

                  </note>, he flies to <hi>unwritten Tradition.</hi> And by this <hi>Word of God unwritten, he says 'tis manifest, that the Doctrine of Purgatory was delivered by the Apostles.</hi> Sure if <hi>Nineteen places of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture</hi> cannot prove it, I would be loth to flie to <hi>Tradition.</hi> And if Recourse to <hi>Tradition</hi> be necessary, then certainly those <hi>places of Scripture</hi> made not the proof they were brought for. And once more, how can <hi>Bellarmine</hi> say here, That we finde not the <hi>Beginning, hujus dogmatis,</hi> of this Article; when he had said before, that he had found it in the <hi>Nineteen places of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture?</hi> For if in these places he could not finde the beginning of the Doctrine of <hi>Purgatory,</hi> he is false while he says he did: And if <hi>he did finde</hi> it there, then he is false here in saying, we finde no beginning of it, And for all his Brags of <note n="*" place="margin">Omnes veteres Graci &amp; Latini, &amp;c. <hi>Bellarm.</hi> L. 1. de Parga. c. 11. §. <hi>Detertio modo.</hi>

                  <note place="margin">A. C. p. 72.</note> 
                  <hi>we can (according to the ordinary Course) be Infallibly assured that it erres in one, and not in another, when it equally by one and the same Authority defines both to be Divine Truth? A. C.</hi> taking here upon him to defend M. <hi>Fisher</hi> the <hi>Jesuite,</hi> could not but see what I had <hi>formerly</hi> written concerning this difficult Question about <hi>General Councels.</hi> And to all that (being large) he replied little or nothing. Now when he thinks that may be forgotten, or as if he did not at all lye in his way, he here turns <hi>Questionist,</hi> to disturb that business, and indeed the Church, as much as he can. But to this Question also I answer again, If any <hi>General Councel</hi> do now erre, either it erres in <hi>things ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely necessary to Salvation,</hi> or in things <hi>not necessary.</hi> If it erre in <hi>things Necessary,</hi> we can be infallibly assured by the <hi>Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,</hi> the <hi>Creeds,</hi> the <hi>four first Councels,</hi> and the <hi>whole Church,</hi> where it erres in one, and not in another. If it be <hi>in non ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessariis,</hi> in things not necessary, 'tis not requisite that we should have for them an infallible assurance. As for that which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, it is notoriously both <hi>cunning,</hi> and <hi>false.</hi> 'Tis <hi>false</hi> to suppose that a General Councel defining two things for Divine Truths, and erring in one, but not erring in another, doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:62620:130"/>
both equally <hi>by one, and the same Authority.</hi> And 'tis cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, because these words <hi>(by the same Authority)</hi> are <hi>equivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal,</hi> and must be distinguished, that the Truth, which <hi>A.

Thus then, suppose a <hi>General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel</hi> erring in one point, and not in another, it doth define both, and <hi>equally by the same delegated Authority which that Councel hath received from the Catholike Church,</hi> But it doth not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine both, and much less equally, <hi>by the same Authority of the Scripture,</hi> (which must be the Councels <hi>Rule,</hi> as well as private mens) no nor by the same Authority of the whole Catholike Church (who did not intentionally give them equal <hi>power</hi> to define <hi>Truth,</hi> and <hi>errour</hi> for Truth.) And I hope <hi>A.

Secondly,</hi> the true Story of that <hi>Epistle,</hi> and that which led S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> into this Expression, was this. <hi>Cornelius</hi> then cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen <hi>Pope,</hi> expostulates with S. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> That his Letters to <hi>Rome</hi> were directed onely to the <hi>Clergie</hi> there, and not to <hi>Him;</hi> and takes it ill, as if S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> had thereby seemed to disapprove his <hi>Election.</hi> S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> replies, That by reason of the <hi>Schism</hi> mov'd then by <hi>Novation,</hi> it was uncertain in <hi>Africk</hi> which of the Two had the more <hi>Canonical Right to the See of Rome;</hi> and that therefore he nam'd him not: But yet that during this uncertainty, he exhorted all that sailed thither, <hi>ut Ecclesiae Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licae Radicem &amp; Matricem agnoscerent &amp; tenerent;</hi> That in all their carriage they should acknowledge, and so hold them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves unto the <hi>Unity</hi> of the <hi>Catholike Church,</hi> which is the <hi>Root and Matrix of it,</hi> and the onely way to avoid participation in the <hi>Schism.</hi> And that this must be S. <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s meaning, I shall thus prove. <hi>First,</hi> because, This could not be his meaning or
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:62620:132"/>
Intention, <hi>That the Sea of Rome was the Root or Matrix of the Catholike Church.</hi> For if he had told them so, he had left them in as great, or greater difficulty, than he found them. For there was then an <hi>Open</hi> and an <hi>Apparent Schism</hi> in the <hi>Church of Rome. Two Bishops, Cornelius and Novation; Two Congregations,</hi> which respectively attended and observed them. So that a perplexed Question must needs have divided their thoughts, which of these <hi>Two</hi> had been that <hi>Root and Matrix</hi> of the Catholike Church. Therefore had S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> meant to pronounce <hi>Rome the Root and Matrix</hi> of the Catholike Church, he would never have done it at such a time, when <hi>Rome</hi> it self was in Schism. Whereas in the other sense, the Counsel is good and plain, Namely, that they should hold themselves to the <hi>Unity and Communion of the Catholike Church,</hi> which is the Root of it. And then necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily they were to suspend their Communion there, till they saw how the <hi>Catholike Church</hi> did incline, to approve, or disaprove the Election of the One, or the Other. And thus S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> frees himself to <hi>Cornelius</hi> from the very least Touch of <hi>Schism. Secondly,</hi> Because <hi>this sense</hi> comes home to <note n="*" place="margin">Baron. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal. 254. Num.</hi> 64. where he cites this Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle.</note> 
                  <hi>Baronius.</hi> For he affirms that S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> and his Colleagues the <hi>African Bishops</hi> did <hi>Communionem suspendere,</hi> suspend their Communion until they heard by <hi>Caldonius</hi> &amp; <hi>Fortunatus,</hi> whose the undoubted right was. So it seems S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> gave that Counsel to these Travellers, which himself followed. For if <hi>Rome,</hi> during the <hi>Schism,</hi> and in so great uncertainty, had yet been <hi>Radix Ecclesiae Catholicae,</hi> Root of the Catholike Church of Christ, I would fain know, how S. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> so great and famous an Assertor of the <hi>Churches U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi> durst once so much as think of <hi>suspending Communion with her. Thirdly,</hi> Because this sense will be plain also by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Passages out of other Epistles of S. <hi>Cyprian.</hi> For writing to <hi>Jubaianus</hi> an <hi>Africane Bishop</hi> against the <hi>Novatians,</hi> who then infested those parts, and durst <hi>Rebaptize</hi> Catholike Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, he saith thus. <note n="†" place="margin">Nos autemqui Ecclesiae unius Caput &amp; Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicem tenemus, pro certo sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  <hi>But we who hold the Head and Root of One Church, do know for certain, and believe, that nothing of this is lawful out of the Catholike Church; And that of Baptism, which is but One, we are the Head, where he himself was at first Baptized, when he held the Ground and Verity of Divine Unity.</hi> Now I conceive 'tis all one, or at least as Argumentative to all purposes, to be <hi>Caput</hi> or <hi>Radix Baptismatis,</hi> Head or Root of <hi>Baptism,</hi> as Head or Root of the <hi>Church.</hi> For there's but One <hi>Baptism,</hi> as well as but One <hi>Church,</hi> and that is the entrance in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this. And S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> affirms and includes himself, <hi>Nos esse Caput,</hi> that we are the Head of <hi>Baptism.</hi> Where yet (I pray observe it) he cannot by <hi>Nos,</hi> We, mean his own <hi>Person</hi> (though if he did, he were the more Opposite to <hi>Rome</hi>) much less can he mean the <hi>Romane Church,</hi> as it is a Particular, and stands se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate from others.

that we are the Head? Therefore he must needs mean the <hi>Unity</hi> and <hi>Society of the Church Catholike,</hi> which the <hi>Novatians</hi> had then left, and whereof he and his Church were still Members.

But because the Obstinate, and inflexible pertinacy of the other Party had not onely refused</hi> Radicis &amp; Matris sinum, <hi>the bosome of their Mother and embracings of their Root, but the Schism increasing and growing raw to the worse, hath set up a Bishop to it self,</hi> &amp;c. Where 'tis observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and I think plain, That S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> employed his <hi>Legates</hi> not to bring the <hi>Catholike Church</hi> to the communion of <hi>Rome,</hi> but <hi>Rome</hi> to the <hi>Catholike Church.</hi> Or to bring the <hi>Novatians</hi> not onely to Communicate with <hi>Cornelius,</hi> but with the <hi>Church Universal,</hi> which was therefore <hi>Head</hi> and <hi>Root</hi> in S. <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s judgment, even to <hi>Rome</hi> it self, as well as to all other, <hi>Great, Ancient,</hi> or even <hi>Apostolical Churches.</hi> And this is yet more plain by the sequel.

And then there is <hi>Radix Existentiae,</hi> the <hi>Root</hi> of its <hi>Existence,</hi> and formal Being, which always presupposes <hi>Being;</hi> And is therefore a <hi>sense less Principal.</hi> Now to apply this. The Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike or Universal Church is, and must needs be the <hi>Root</hi> of <hi>Essence</hi> and <hi>Being</hi> to <hi>Rome,</hi> and all other Particulars. And this is the <hi>Principal Root, Head,</hi> or <hi>Matrix</hi> that gives <hi>Being.</hi> And <hi>Rome,</hi> but with all other Particular Churches, and no more then other <hi>Patriarchal Churches,</hi> was and is <hi>Radix Existentiae,</hi> the <hi>Root</hi> of <hi>The Churches</hi> Existence. And this agrees with that known and received <hi>Rule in Art:</hi> That <hi>Universals give Essence to their Particulars, and Particulars supply their Universals with Existence.</hi> For as <hi>Socrates</hi> and every Particular man bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row their Essence from the <hi>Species</hi> and <hi>Definition</hi> of a man, which is Universal, but this Universal Nature and Being of Man hath no <hi>actual Existence</hi> but in <hi>Socrates</hi> and all other par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular men: so, the <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> and every other particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Church in the world, receive their very Essence and Being of a Church from the Definition of the <hi>Catholike Universal Church of Christ;</hi> But this <hi>Universal Nature</hi> and Being of the Church hath no <hi>actual Existence</hi> but in <hi>Rome</hi> and all other <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Churches,</hi> and <hi>equal</hi> Existence in all her particulars. And should all the Particular Churches in the world fall away from Christ, save onely <hi>One</hi> (which God forbid) yet the <hi>Nature, Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence,</hi> and <hi>Being</hi> of the Universal Church would both <hi>Exist</hi> and <hi>Subsist</hi> in that one <hi>Particular.</hi> Out of all which to me most clear it is, That for the Churches <hi>Being,</hi> the <hi>Catholike Church,</hi> and that in <hi>Unity</hi> (for <hi>Ens &amp; Unum,</hi> Being, and Being one, are Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible) is <hi>Radix,</hi> the <hi>Root,</hi> Head, <hi>Matrix, Fountain,</hi> or <hi>Original</hi> (call it what you will) of <hi>Rome,</hi> and all other <hi>Particular Churches.</hi> But <hi>Rome</hi> is no more than other <hi>Churches,</hi> the <hi>Root,</hi> or <hi>Matrix</hi> of the <hi>Catholike Churches Existence,</hi> or <hi>Place</hi> of her actual Residence.

I may not deny God hath hitherto preserved Her, but for a better end doubtless than they turn it to. But <hi>Infallible</hi> She was never: Yet if that Lady did as the <hi>Jesuite</hi> in his close avows, or others will rest satisfied with it, who can help it? Sure none but God. And by <hi>A. C</hi>'s leave, this (which I said, is no work for my Pen) cannot be learned, no not of the <hi>One, Holy, Catholike, and Apostolike Church,</hi> much less of the <hi>Roman.</hi> For though the <hi>Foundation</hi> be one and the same, and sufficiently known by <hi>Scripture</hi> and the <hi>Creeds;</hi> Yet for the building upon the <hi>Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation,</hi> the <hi>adding</hi> to it; the <hi>Detracting</hi> from it; the <hi>Joyning</hi> other things with it; The <hi>grating</hi> upon it: Each of these may be <hi>damnable</hi> to some, and not to others, according to the <hi>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, Wisdome, means of Information</hi> which some have, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers want: And according to the <hi>ignorance, simplicity, and want of Information,</hi> which some others have<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and cannot help: And according to the <hi>Negligence, Contempt, Wilfulness,</hi> and <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice,</hi> with <hi>Obstinacy,</hi> which some have against the Known Truth; and all or some of these in different degrees in every particular man. And that in the whole <hi>Latitude of mankinde,</hi> from the most wise and learned in the School of Christ, to the simplest Idiot that hath been so happy as to be initiated into the Faith by <hi>Baptism.</hi> Now the Church hath not this knowledge of all particulars, <hi>Men,</hi> and <hi>Conditions,</hi> nor can she apply the <hi>Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> to the <hi>Men.</hi> And therefore cannot teach just how far e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very man must believe, as it relates to the <hi>possibility,</hi> or <hi>impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility</hi> of his salvation in every particular. And that which the Church cannot <hi>teach,</hi> men cannot <hi>learn</hi> of her. She can teach the <hi>Foundation,</hi> and men were happy if they would <hi>learn</hi> it, and the Church more happy would she <hi>teach</hi> nothing but that as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to <hi>Salvation;</hi> for certainly nothing but that is Neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary.

                  <hi>Church of England;</hi> To this <hi>A. C.</hi> excepts, and says, <hi>That I neither prove, nor can prove, that it is lawful for one (per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded especially as the Lady was) to go to the Protestant Church.</hi> There's a great deal of Cunning, and as much Malice in this passage: but I shall easily pluck the <hi>Sting</hi> out of the Tail of this <hi>Wisp.</hi> And <hi>first,</hi> I have proved it already through this whole Discourse, and therefore can prove it, That the <hi>Church of England</hi> is an <hi>Orthodox</hi> Church. And therefore with the same labour it is proved, that men may lawfully go unto it, and <hi>communicate</hi> with it; for so a man not onely <hi>may,</hi> but <hi>ought</hi> to do with an <hi>Orthodox Church.</hi> And a <hi>Romanist</hi> may communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate with the <hi>Church of England,</hi> without any Offence in the <hi>Nature of the Thing</hi> thereby incurred. But if his <hi>Conscience,</hi> through mis-information, check at it, he should do well in that Case, rather to <hi>inform his Conscience,</hi> than <hi>forsake any Orthodox Church</hi> whatsoever. <hi>Secondly, A. C.</hi> tells me plainly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>That I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not prove that a man so perswaded as the Lady was, may go to the Protestant Church;</hi> that is, That a <hi>Romane Catholike</hi> may not go to the <hi>Protestant Church.</hi> Why, I never went about to prove that a <hi>Romane Catholike</hi> being and continuing such, might against his Conscience, go to the <hi>Protestant Church.</hi> For these words (<hi>A man perswaded as the Lady is</hi>) are <hi>A. C's</hi> words; they are not <hi>mine.</hi> Mine are not simply that the <hi>Lady</hi> might, or that she might not: but Comparative they are, <hi>That she might more easily answer to God for coming to, than for going from the Church of England.</hi> And that is every way most true. For in this doubtful time of hers, when<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> upon my Reasons given, she went again to Church; when yet soon after (as you say at least) she was sorry for it. I say, at this time she was in heart and resolution a <hi>Romano Catholike,</hi> or she was not: If she were not, (as it seems by her doubting she was not then fully resolved) then my speech is most true, that she might more easily answer God for coming to Service in the <hi>Church of England,</hi> than for leaving it. For a <hi>Protestant</hi> she had been, and, for ought I knew, at the end of this Conference, so she was; and then 'twas no sin in it self to come to an <hi>Orthodox Church;</hi> nor no sin against her Conscience, she continuing a <hi>Protestant,</hi> for ought which then
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:62620:135"/>
appeared to me. But if she then were a <hi>Romane Catholike,</hi> (as the <hi>Jesuite</hi> and <hi>A. C.</hi> seem confident she was) yet my speech is true too. For then she might more easily answer God for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the <hi>Church of England,</hi> which is <hi>Orthodox,</hi> and leaving the <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> which is <hi>Superstitious,</hi> than, by leaving the <hi>Church of England,</hi> communicate with all the <hi>Superstitions of Rome.</hi> Now the <hi>cunning</hi> and the <hi>malignity</hi> of <hi>A. C.</hi> lies in this: He would fain have the world think that I am so <hi>Indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent in Religion,</hi> as that I did maintain, the <hi>Lady,</hi> being consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entiously perswaded of the Truth of the <hi>Romish Doctrine,</hi> might yet, against both her <hi>conscience,</hi> and against open and avowed <hi>profession,</hi> come to the <hi>Protestant Church.</hi>

                  <hi>Azorius</hi> affirms this in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press terms; And what do you think, can he prove it? Nay, not <hi>Azorius</hi> onely, but other <hi>Priests</hi> and <hi>Jesuites</hi> here in <hi>England,</hi> either teach some of their <hi>Proselytes,</hi> or else some of them learn it without teaching, That though they be perswaded as this Lady was, that is, though they be <hi>Romane Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes,</hi> yet either to gain honour, or save their purse, they may go to the <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant Church,</hi> just as the Jesuite here says, <hi>The Lady did out of frailty and</hi>

                  <hi>fear to offend the King.</hi> Therefore I pray <hi>A. C.</hi> if this be gross dissimulation both with God and the world, speak to your fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows to leave perswading or practising of it, and leave men in the <hi>profession of Religion</hi> to be as they seem, or to seem and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear as they are; Let's have no Mask worn here. <hi>A. C's second Reason</hi> why one so perswaded as that Lady was, might not go to the <hi>Protestant Church,</hi> is, <hi>Because that were outwardly to profess</hi>
                  <note place="margin">A. C. p. 73.</note> 
                  <hi>a Religion in Conscience known to be false.</hi> To this I answer, <hi>first,</hi> that if this Reason be true, it concerns all men, as well as those that be perswaded as the <hi>Lady</hi> was. For no man may outwardly profess a <hi>Religion</hi> in conscience known to be false; <hi>For with the heart man believeth to righteousness, and with the mouth he confesseth to salvation, Rom.</hi> 10. Now to his own<note place="margin">Rom. 10. 10.</note> salvation no man can confess a known false Religion. <hi>Secondly,</hi> if the Religion of the <hi>Protestants</hi> be in conscience a <hi>known false Religion,</hi> then the <hi>Romanists Religion</hi> is so too; for their <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion</hi> is the same; Nor do the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> and the <hi>Protestants</hi> set up a different <hi>Religion</hi> (for the <hi>Christian Religion</hi> is the same to both) but they differ in the same <hi>Religion:</hi> And the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence is in certain <hi>gross corruptions,</hi> to the very endangering of salvation, which each side says the other is guilty of. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> the Reason given is most untrue; for it may appear by all the former Discourse to any <hi>Indifferent Reader,</hi> that <hi>Religion,</hi> as it is professed in the <hi>Church of England,</hi> is nearest of any Church now in being to the <hi>Primitive Church:</hi> And therefore not a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion known to be false.
