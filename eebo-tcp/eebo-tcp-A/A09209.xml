            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To the most Honourable Assembly of Knights, Citizens, and
Burgesses of the House of Parliament.</head>
            <head type="sub">The humble Petition of the Aduenturers in the Ship called the Pearle.</head>
            <p>HVmbly shewing: That Shee departed out of the Port of London in Nouember 1611. and returned
two yeeres after laden with goods, to the value of 20000.<hi rend="sup">li</hi>. Vpon the 26. of Nouember 1613. be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore
the goods came to London, <hi>Morris,</hi> one of the Aduenturers, was sent for before diuers of the Lords
of his Maiesties Councell, Who deliuered that the Spanish Embassador had made a great Complaint to
his Maiestie, that the Pearle had beene in the East Indies, and rob'd the King of <hi>Spaines</hi> Subiects, desiring therefore
that the goods might be sequestred into his Maiesties Custodie (as indifferent betweene the Embassador, and the
Aduenturers, vntill the point of Piracie was tryed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Morris</hi> answered he neuer was Pirate,<note place="margin">Heerein the Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner was debar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of the benefit of the Law, as he conceiues.</note> but a Merchant, and had paid the King many Thousands for Custome
and Impost; and yet if he were, the Law of England was, that giuing securitie, he was to possesse the goods vntill
the Law had tryed the Title; but this would not be granted. But their Lordships ordered that the goods should
be put into Ware-houses (the weights and contents first taken by <hi>Morris)</hi> vnder three locks, whereof his Maiesty
had one key committed to Sir <hi>Lionel Cranfield</hi> and Sir <hi>Arthur Ingram;</hi> the Embassador another key;<note place="margin">The key of the Ware-house <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris</hi> had, yet the locks were broken open, the goods carried away, and sold without his priuitie.</note> and <hi>Morris</hi>
a third key: and if by Law they appertained to him, God forbid (said the Earle of Northampton) but they should
haue them.</p>
            <p>Afterwards the cause was brought into the Admirall Court, and in Aprill 1614. after seuerall daies of hearing of
the same, before Sir <hi>Daniel Donn,</hi> knight; and Doctor <hi>Treuor</hi> doctors of the Laws, chiefe Iudges of the said Court
(in the presence of Master <hi>Manning</hi> Proctor for the Embassador, and <hi>Francis Fowler</hi> Sollicitor for his Lordship, and
of <hi>Iames Ireland</hi> Proctor for <hi>Morris</hi>) It was vpon the 21. of the said Month of Aprill ordered, that the goods so
sequestred, should be prized, and sold by the publique Officers of his Maiesties Exchequer, or by any other that
were able at the full value with all Celeritie that might be, and the moneis arising thereof to be sequestred, and safe
kept in the hands of Sir <hi>Lionel Cranfield,</hi> and Sir <hi>Arthur Ingram</hi> Knights, they giuing fit caution to pay the moneis
to the true proprietors.</p>
            <p>But vpon the 23. of the said Month of Aprill 1614. Sir <hi>Arthur Ingram</hi> came before the said Iudges,<note place="margin">Of these goods, to the value of 2600. li. were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered to the Spanish Embas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sador, who was to giue securitie to pay them to the Proprietors, if the suggestion of the Piracie made by his Lordship was acquitted, but yet they neither haue the money, nor the securitie.</note> and alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
refused, both for himselfe, and Sir <hi>Lionel Cranfield,</hi> to giue any caution for the said moneis, as they had or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
them to doe: Whereupon the Iudges the same day ordered, that the said goods should be by Sir <hi>Lionel Cran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field</hi>
and Sir <hi>Arthur Ingram,</hi> prized, and sold to such as would giue most for the same; And that the moneis thereof
accruing, should be deposited in safe keeping in his Maiesties Receipt at Westminster, for whom right had.</p>
            <p>That in Aprill 1615. the said cause receiued finall hearing before the Right Honourable Sir <hi>Iulius Casar,</hi> Knight;
Sir <hi>Daniel Donn,</hi> Knight, chiefe Iudge of the Admirall Court; Sir <hi>Iohn Crooke,</hi> Knight; and diuers others his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iesties
Iudges of the Admiraltie of England: where the point of Piracie was legally acquitted, and discharged by
Proclamation.</p>
            <p>Since which, they haue often attended the Lord Embassador of Spain, that as he was the Author of this their mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune,
so he would be pleased to get them restitutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of their said goods, or the moneis they were sold for, with such
damages as they haue sustained for want thereof:<note place="margin">That after the Piracy acquitted, so much of the goods as came to 2800. li. or there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts, were sold, and the moneis disposed of with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out their consents.</note> from whom, they haue receiued many faire and hopefull answers,
and in truth neuer went from his Lordship vnsatisfied with strong assurance to effect their request within some
short time after: And in these hopes they haue spent many Moneths, but yet no reliefe thereby, but they, their
Wiues and Children still suffred to languish in great miserie; besides diuers others to whom they are indebted, are
also like to be vndone, for that the Petitioners are not able to giue them satisfaction, by reason their goods are kept
from them as aforesaid.</p>
            <p>That they haue likewise diuers other waies endeuoured to haue restitution of their goods, or the true value there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
but neuer could obtaine the same, nor certainely vnderstand how they haue beene disposed.</p>
            <p>THerefore the humble Suite of the Complainants is, That this Honourable House will be pleased to take
into their considerations these Points following, as well for the reliefe of the Complainants, in restitution
of their goods, or the true value, with such further damages, as they haue sustained for want thereof, as for
the generall good of the People.</p>
            <p>Whether the goods were sold to the full value, and according to the true intent of the Order in the Admirall Court.</p>
            <p>Whether the moneis they were sold for, were deposited in his Maiesties Receipt at Westminster, or what is became
of them.</p>
            <p>And whether it be not a iust grieuance to the Common-wealth, That vpon complaint, and suggestion of Piracie
by any Forraigne Princes Minister, the Subiects, by strong hand, and powerfull proceedings, should be kept from
their goods, and the moneis they were sold for, after the Point of Piracie legally cleared, and acquitted by Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation,
as the Complainants haue beene euer since Aprill 1615.</p>
            <p>And if these, or any of them shall in the high Wisedome of this Honourable Court be found to be grieuances<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p>Then, the Complainants humbly pray, that they may be relieued therein, as the Iustice of their cause shall
require.</p>
