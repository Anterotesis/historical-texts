         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>of vrines, to wit, ſuch as do decline from any one extreame,
what concerneth the ſame, may eaſily, by that which hath
bene ſaid of the ſame extreame, be vnderſtood. Now if any
ſhall enquire what is the cauſe I ſpend ſo much time about
this ſubiect: I anſwer, it is by reaſon of the old inueterate o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion,
or rather errour, which moſt people haue conceiued
concerning this ſtrumpet; whom for this cauſe I haue here
vnmasked, and layed open to the view of euery one that will
not ſhut his eyes in the cleare Sunne-ſhine; and that to the
end that none may be circumuented by the fraud and coze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage
of ſuch as abuſe her for their owne benefit. But leſt any
ſhould imagine theſe things to be but fancies fetcht from
mine owne braine, therefore not contented to ſet down mine
owne poſitiue opinion, I haue both backt, fortified and flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
it with the bulwarks of the best writers of ancient and
later times, whoſe owne words I haue truly tranſlated, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting
thee likewiſe, learned Reader, to the marginall quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,
where for thy recreation and better ſatisfaction, not
the names of the authors onely, and the particular places, but
the very words of the originall are often ſet downe, that ſo
it may more euidently appeare, that this latter iurie finds her
guiltie, as the former great enqueſt after the inditement
found <hi>Billa vera.</hi> The condemnation muſt then of neceſsitie
follow, ſince the parties offending hauing had theſe three laſt
aſsizes allowed them to pleade for themſelues, haue ſaid no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.
This ſentence I referre to this<note n="*" place="margin">The hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Court of Parliament.</note> ſage aſſembly, who, as
I hope, will take this publicke buſineſſe, as a matter of no ſmall
moment, into their ſerious conſiderations. But me thinkes I
heare ſome ſay, what is then the vſe of vrines in diſcerning
of diſeaſes? or ſerueth it for no vſe at all? I anſwer, that ſo
farre am I from abrogating this ſo ancient and neceſſarie
a ſigne, receiued by all our ancient and late writers, which
I do highly eſteeme, and account of the ſame being rightly

ſome diſeaſes being of no vſe at all) to giue vs notice of the
nature, together with the changes and alterations, as like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
what is like to be the iſſue of the ſame. The Phyſitian is
therefore firſt to enquire diligently into the nature of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe,
together with all the other ſignes and circumſtances
thereof: and then, comparing all together, to giue forth his
beſt and moſt aſſured iudgeme<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t.<note place="margin">Fooliſh cuſtom of the countrey people.</note> Moſt fooliſh therefore and
abſurd is the ſottiſh cuſtome of the countrey people now a
dayes, bringing the vrine to the Phyſitian, it may be in ſome
old oylie or inkie bottle, and then to demand of him as of ſome
<hi>Delphian oracle,</hi> the whole nature of the diſeaſe, the pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents
age, and diuerſe other things wherewith they ought to
acquaint vs, as alſo with all the other ſignes and circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of the diſeaſe: euen as the client is to lay open his cauſe to
the Lawyer, how learned ſoeuer, and skilfull in his profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.
It is yet not vnworthie the obſeruation, that one and the
ſame vrine hath often diuers and ſeuerall ſignifications, and
therefore vnleſſe by diuerſe other ſignes and circumſtances
limited, can neuer affoord vs any certaintie, as hereafter
both in the colours and contents the enſuing diſcourſe ſhall
make manifeſt. And thus may the right vſe to the wiſe and
vnderſtanding eaſily appeare; eſpecially to ſuch as haue bene
or yet ſhall hereafter be admitted vnto ſuch myſteries. And
therefore ignorant Empiricks, women, and many other ſuch,
haue no ſhare or intereſt in theſe affaires, as not being able to
diue into the depth of the premiſſes. And as for cleargie men,
they cannot be ignorant, that they ought to be employed about
buſineſſes of an higher nature. And if they will haue a care
<pb facs="tcp:4002:3"/>
of the ſoules entruſted to them, they need not trouble them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
with their bodies. Now that one ſigne, in ſome diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes

learned. The pulſe will pleade for a preheminence aboue the
vrine: and to iudge of this, as of a number of other ſignes,
it will of neceſsitie require the Phyſitians preſence. Now
that the vrines in many diſeaſes, and thoſe of vndoubted
danger, do often ſhew thee no more then the ground thou go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt on;
and that many other ſignes beſides are of neceſsitie to
be obſerued, hath bene at great length related in the former
tractate, and ſhall yet more plainly and particularly in this
which followeth appeare. And for thy more particular infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
I haue ſet downe the ſeuerall ſignifications of vrines,
and that according to the opinions of ſuch Authors as haue
written of them; together with ſome particulars which haue
neuer yet bene publiſhed by any Engliſh writer that I haue
as yet ſeene, as by the contents of the bookes and chapters may
appeare. Some things alſo which haue bene by others written
and auouched for vncontrolled truths, I haue confuted as
falſe and erronious: and that, as I thinkt, by vnanſwerable
arguments, illuſtrating the ſame with varietie of ancient
and recent authorities, together with plentie of pertinent
examples, being true hiſtoricall relations, obſerued both by my
ſelfe and other Authors: the which howſoeuer they do not
ſimply proue; yet do they not a little illustrate the matter in
hand, and make it more perſpicuous to the meaner ſort. Now
whereas I ſometimes inſert ſomething of the ignorance and
vnſufficiencie of ſome offenders, ſome may, perhaps, reply,
that it may ſometimes befall a good Phyſitian to faile as well
as any of them. I confeſſe Indeed, <hi>Bernardus non videt om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia:

that I ſay nothing of a medling Miniſter that neuer was

Reader iudge ingenuouſly, whether the offenders be furniſhed

the other ſexe will needs haue a ſhare in theſe buſineſſes alſo:

My purpoſe is not to dwell vpon this ſubiect, nor yet to
vrge many arguments againſt it, the thing being ſo abſurd in it
ſelfe. I will relate but one tragicall ſtorie out of a late writer,
of a mother who made away her owne child,<note place="margin">A tragicall ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie.</note> with an intent, as
ſhe thought to cure him. <hi>A countrey woman</hi> (ſaith mine author)
<hi>hauing a young ſonne of cacheoticall diſpoſition, and now entring into
a dropſie,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Alexand. Bened. de curand. morb. lib. 15. cap. 25.</note>

his will, his head foremoſt, into an ouen, immediatly after the drawing
of the bread, ſtopping vp againe immediatly the mouth of her ouen.
Her gabling goſſips were officiouſly attending a better euent then they
found, as alſo helping her to bring to paſſe this braue exploit. He be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
once in, was preſently ſuffocated with the ſmoke for want of freſh
aire. The mother within a little ſpace calleth to her ſonne oftener then
once in an audible voyce, enquiring what benefit he found; who an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
her no more then Baal did his Prieſts.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. King. 18. 26 27. 28.</note> 
                  <hi>Theſe pratling goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſips
perſwaded this ſimple woman, that his ſilence was an aſſured ſigne
of the benefit he thereby receiued: the which this credulous woman,
ſtill hoping where no hope was, eaſily beleeued: but at length found
that which ſhe least looked for; drawing out of the ouen her dead
ſonne, cured not onely of this, but of all other diſeaſes alſo; and then
(but all too late) blameth as well her owne too too credulous ſimplici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
as the malapert boldneſſe of the ſhe-phyſitians, inducing her to vſe
a remedie farre worſe then the diſeaſe it ſelfe.</hi> As for you, <hi>Ladyes
and Gentlewomen</hi> (with your good leaues let me be ſo bold as
to tell you my mind in a word or two) howſoeuer I cannot but
much commend your great charitie and loue, in affoording
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:4002:12"/>
both your paines and your purſes for the relieuing of ſicke di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſed

buſie, the life of a man being no matter of ſmall importance,
and which being once loſt,<note place="margin">Soles occidere &amp; redire poſſunt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nobis cum ſemel occidit breuis lux, Nox eſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petua vna dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mienda<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Catull.</note> can neuer till the reſurrection be
recouered. And remember, that there may be an ouerſight as
well in neglecting a fit and conuenient remedie in due time, as
in exhibiting a dangerous and deſperate remedie. And whereas
often it cometh to paſſe, that either your neceſſitie or importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie
doth extort from the learned Phyſitian good and whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
remedies either for your owne or others infirmities: yet I
intreate you, not to be ſo indiſcreete, as to make one ſalue ſerue
for euery ſore.<note place="margin">A good remedy ignorantly or out of ſeaſon ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited, may yet proue dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſed.</note> The remedie indeed may be good, but (as often
cometh to paſſe) ill vſed, or rather abuſed. And that which you
haue ſometimes tried to be a ſoueraigne medicine for your
ſelues; yet another time, by reaſon of a number of new occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,
the ſame remedie may produce an effect farre differing
from the former: how much more then in another? The conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution
of the partie ſhould be conſidered, the ſexe, age, time of
yeare, yea and of the diſeaſe it ſelfe; as whether it be in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning,
in the increaſe, in the height, or declining, with many
moe circumſtances are here to be conſidered. But put yet the
caſe the remedie be good againſt ſuch a diſeaſe; yet may many
other circumſtances croſſe this iudication in any indiuiduall
perſon, which were here too tedious to relate. It may then eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
appeare, that this is a buſineſſe of an higher ſtraine then many
do well conſider: but of this matter no more. Now howbeit
this fretting canker (I meane of vnſufficient, vnlearned, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skilfull
Phiſitians) hath crept ouer the whole Chriſtian world,
yet the inconuenience is not in all alike. For howbeit in Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manie
Empiricks do ſo abound that they haue begun of late
yeares (ſuppoſing it may be that we are here vnfurniſhed) to
come and viſit vs here in this Iland,<note place="margin">The laudable cuſtome of the Germane natio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in prouiding fit and learned Phyſitians, and allowing them good mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance.</note> yet can I not but much
commend and praiſe their care and induſtrie in prouiding for
the maintenance of the honeſt and learned Phyſitian. There
each ſeuerall Citie, towne, or corporation, hath certaine Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians
entertained by ſtipends out of the chamber ſtockes
(which there by reaſon of their admirable induſtrie, as being
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:4002:13"/>
much addicted to the publicke good are very rich) a dwelling
houſe being likewiſe allowed them for their liues: and each
Citie or towne according to the proportionable bigneſſe, hath
moe or fewer of thoſe ſtipendiarie Phyſitians: and none among
them admitted, but ſuch as for their ſufficiencie, and long time
ſpent in the ſtudie of that profeſſion, haue taken their degrees in
ſome famous Vniuerſitie. All the Apothecaries and Surgeons

and by them to be controlled;<note place="margin">They often viſit the Apotheca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries ſhops, and take a ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

them muſt be admitted. And of all the Apothecaries drugs,
as well ſimples as compounds, they take a narrow ſuruey twice
a yeare; to wit, euery Spring and fall: beſides the viewing of
their drugs immediatly after the buying of them (which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
moſt commonly to paſſe twice a yeare, at Lerpzig or
Franckfort faire) not being lawfull for them to make vſe of any
of them vntill ſuch time as they be firſt viſited and allowed by
the aforeſaid Phyſitians. At the viewing and viſiting of their
wares, is appointed one fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the chiefe Magiſtrate of the Citie,
commonly called the Burger maiſter, to ſit in commiſſion with
the Phyſitians. If the Apothecarie ſhall be found faultie, or his
drugs any wayes vnſufficient, the aforeſaid perſons fine him at
their pleaſures; as alſo ſet a reaſonable rate or taxe vpon all his
drugs and compoſitions, and that according to the riſing or fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of the prizes of the drugs. Neither yet may the Apothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carie
of himſelfe make, mixe, or compound any great compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of many ſeuerall ingredients, vnleſſe the Phyſitians, one or
more being preſent, firſt ſee all the ſeuerall ingredients, and then
allow of the ſame. He can likewiſe take no apprentice into his
ſeruice, but ſuch as firſt ſhall be ſworne faithfully to make and
compound according to the Phyſitians preſcriptions, not alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
any thing in his bill without his knowledge and allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance:
the which oath the Phyſitians haue power to exact of
the aforeſaid apprentices.<note place="margin">The great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moditie of this ſo laudable a cuſtome.</note> Of this ſo laudable and praiſe-worthy

wholeſome counſell: as alſo that the inhabitants in their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremitie
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:4002:13"/>
are preferred before ſtrangers. The moderation of fees
likewiſe, in regard of their ſtanding ſtipends, is ſome eaſe to the
purſes of priuate men, but eſpecially to the poorer ſort, to whom
by this meanes they are the better enabled to affoord their
counſell for little or nothing. The countrey round about findeth
likewiſe euery where learned Phyſitians to aduiſe with, as alſo
good and ſufficient ſtuffe, neither fuſtie not ſophiſticate, and
that at a reaſonable rate. Now how farre we come ſhort of this
ſo laudable and worthie pollicie, thoſe that know any thing are
not ignorant. We are apt enough to imitate that which is
naught in our neighbour nations, and why make we not vſe of
ſuch things as deſerue praiſe and commendation? From the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forenamed

whereof moſt people are perſwaded that the Phyſitian is able to
find out, not onely the diſeaſe in generall, but euen euery ſigne

declared to be diuers, whereof this is the chiefe, to wit,
that the chiefe and principall part of Phyſicke diagnoſticke or
ſemioticke, which teacheth vs to know the nature, cauſes, and
ſubſtance of the diſeaſe by the ſignes and grounds of the ſame,
is either not knowne at all, or at leaſt altogether, in regard of

do onely labour to know and diſcerne the nature and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
of the diſeaſe by the ſole and fraudulent indication of the
ſtuckring vrine. But it is acknowledged of all true Phyſitians,
that the ground and beginning of finding out aright the true
method of curing diſeaſes, is the knowledge of the diſeaſe, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with the place ſeiſed with the ſame, which is not
knowne by the bare inſpection of the vrine onely, being but a
doubtfull ſigne; but (as <hi>Galen</hi> ſaith well) the knowledge of the
diſeaſe is collected by meanes of the place affected, together
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:4002:15"/>
with the diſpoſition of the ſame beſides nature: which being
the internall cauſe of the diſeaſe (or the diſeaſe it ſelfe) annoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the action, it is no maruell if the ſignes of each be common
to both: and thus is the diſeaſe and place affected diſcerned
and knowne, both by the parts of the ſubſtance therof, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents,
adherents, the action intereſſed, together with the acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents
of the diſeaſe, from the parts of the ſubſtance of the part
affected: as if we ſhall perceiue any griſtle of the windpipe to
be ſpit vp with coughing, it doth argue and indicate to vs an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ulceration
of the lungs, together with a conſumption of the
ſame. From the contents; as if thou ſhalt perceiue the chyle
(that is, the meate receiued into the ſtomacke and a little al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered)
or the ordure iſſue out of a wound, thou mayeſt from
thence ſafely collect that either the ſtomack, or guts are woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.
Such things alſo as do adhere or grow to the part, do both
declare the diſeaſe and the part annoyed therewith. For if vpon
a fracture of the ſcull there grow out little round lumps like vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
little muſhromes, it doth argue the dammage and hurt of the
membrane or skin couering the braines. No leſſe doth the
hurt of the action bewray as well the hurt of the organe and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument
of it, as the diſeaſe it ſelfe: as the retention of the v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine
doth argue an obſtruction in the pipes conueighing the v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine
from the kidneyes to the bladder: or the exceſſiue fluxe of
the ſame being crude and not concocted, doth argue the indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition

accidents of the ſame, commonly called <hi>pathognomonica,</hi> the

And yet this the ordinarie ſort of vrine-monging Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians
will neuer be able to diſcerne, as not being preſent with
the patient. For as in the yellow Iaundiſe, a yellow and ſaffron
like colour of the skinne doth better declare any obſtruction

and foole-hardie finding out of diſeaſes, by meanes of the vrine
onely, for whoſe ſlanderous backbiting I care not a ruſh. For
ſuch as cannot helpe, I ſee not how they can hurt me. No more
can I conceiue what the Phyſitian can performe, as concerning
the cure of the diſeaſe, being ignorant of the nature and eſtate
of the ſame. For this cauſe the ancient Phyſitians did with
great labour, trauell, and induſtrie, ſearch out the cauſe, the
nature and ſubſtance of the diſeaſe, from the which the indica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of remedies are deriued, and not from the vrine onely, but
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:4002:17"/>
from the ſignes called Pathognomonicke, and from the whole
concourſe of the ſymptomes or accidents: who did likewiſe
deuide Phyſicke principally into two parts, to wit, that which
we commonly call Therapeuticke, whoſe moſt large and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
ſcope, is to cure diſeaſes by contrary remedies: and into
that part which we call Diagnoſticke; whoſe moſt common
ſcope is to diſcerne the whole and ſound from the like, and the
ſicke and infirme from the whole, being vnlike the one to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
And this part of Phyſicke doth farre excell the other, to
wit, the Therapeuticke, the which without the Diagnoſticke
is of ſmall vſe or profit. And becauſe it did lay open the perfect
and abſolute knowledge of the diſeaſe, by meanes of the ſignes
Pathognomonicke, proper and peculiar to euery diſeaſe, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with the concurrence of accidents, which the Empiricks
called <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> (which were nothing elſe but the collection

                     </gap>,
or that part of Phyſicke which handleth the ſignes of diſeaſes.
Wherefore we cannot but much wonder at <hi>Galen,</hi> a man of ſo
great learning, who beſides two hundreth and fiftie bookes
written of diuerſe ſciences, and of all the other parts of Phyſicke
aboue foure hundreth; all being likewiſe written in ſo good
order and method, that notwithſtanding he hath not brought
to full perfection this ſo noble a part of Phyſicke, called Diag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noſticke,
but onely diſperſedly here and there, eſpecially in that
booke called the Conſtitution or ordering of the Art of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicke,
hath as it were ſowne ſome ſeeds of the ſame. But yet <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uicenna,
Rhazes,</hi> and other Arabian Phyſitians, and ſuch among
the Greeks as haue written of late after <hi>Galen,</hi> as <hi>Paulus, Aegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neta,
Aetius, Actuarius,</hi> and <hi>Alexander Trallianus,</hi> following
the footſteps of the ancient Empiricks, did collect and gather
together in euery ſeuerall Chapter which did diſcourſe of the
diſeaſe, a great number of the ſignes and ſeuerall accidents of
the ſame: but ſo confuſedly and indiſtinctly, that hardly coul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt
thou diſcerne one manner of ſigne from another inſomuch
as thou mayeſt, not without cauſe, call their Diagnoſticke Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicke,
the confuſed chaos of <hi>Democritus.</hi> And further they do
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:4002:18"/>
not inſtruct vs ſufficiently what ſigne of the diſeaſe doth argue
or ſhew foorth the greater or ſmaller ſtrength. But there is in
Germanie at this day,<note place="margin">And in England alſo.</note> a ſort of idle prating fellowes, more foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
then any others, who, as if all the ſignes of euery diſeaſe
were to be ſeene in the vrine, are not aſhamed, by the ſole and
bare inſpection thereof, to prate and pronounce ſentence con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the ſubſtance of the diſeaſe, and the life and death of
the diſeaſed, as hath bene ſaid alreadie. To the end therefore
that their impudencie may be made manifeſt, and layd open to
euery one, I purpoſe to inſert ſomething in this Epiſtle concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the differences of ſignes, to the end that I may miniſter
occaſion to ſome others more learned then my ſelfe, to handle
the ſame by an abſolute &amp; exquiſite method: the which taske I
will alſo willingly vndertake for the good of the ſicke, if I may
obtaine ſo much time and leiſure, that at length this ſo hainous
a fault, and worthy of no ſmall puniſhment, may be baniſhed
from among the companie of all honeſt and ingenuous Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians,
and a right and perfect method, as well for diſcerning as
for curing,<note place="margin">Diuiſion of the ſignes.</note> may be ſet downe. Now it is granted, as well among
Phyloſophers as Phyſitians, that the effects and accidents do
indicate and declare their cauſes. It is likewiſe well knowne,
that the accidents are nothing elſe but the effects of the diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
of the diſeaſe. No man therefore can deny, that the acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents
(of which number are alſo the actions intereſſed, and
ſome things which eſſentially do adhere thereunto) do indicate
and declare, as well the diſeaſe as the place affected, as being
the harbour and receptacle of the ſame, and vnto which the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies
ought to be applyed. Now as concerning the accidents,
ſome of them are called by the Greekes <hi>Epiphaenomena,</hi> that is,
ſuch as do appeare indeed, but vaniſh away againe before the
diſeaſe be at an end: others againe called <hi>Pathognomonica,</hi> which
being of the eſſence of the diſeaſe, do both begin and end with
the ſame. And theſe be inſeparable and certaine ſignes of the
diſeaſe, the concourſe of which doth more certainly and truly
declare vnto vs, the nature, manner, and kind of the diſeaſe, then
any vrine can do. As a continuall feauer, together with a pric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
and ſtinging paine in the ſide, a great cough and ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:4002:18"/>
of breath, when as they concurre together, and come as
it were all at one inſtant, are euident and certaine ſignes of a
<hi>Pleureſie.</hi> But other accidents which do after ſucceed, are called
<hi>Epiphaenomena</hi> or <hi>Synedreouonta,</hi> as if thou ſhouldeſt ſay, aſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors
or aſſiſtants to the diſeaſe, vnto the which alſo they are not
inſeparably annexed, nor yet haue their originall together with
the ſame; but for the moſt part, either ſeldome, or after a doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
manner, do accompanie the diſeaſe, not making vp the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
but certaine differences of diſeaſes. As in a <hi>Pleureſie</hi>
a red, bloudie, or yet yellowiſh ſpittle, a paine extending it ſelfe
to the breaſt bone or neather part of the <hi>midriffe,</hi> watching,
deliberation, and terrible dreames: theſe accidents are called
aſſiſtant or accompanying, and do declare either the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
of the diſeaſe; or elſe the mildneſſe or malignitie of the
ſame. Now it behooueth the Phyſitian to ponder and expend
with himſelfe in ſuch a concourſe of accidents equally, the
ſtrength of euery accident apart, and to compare together ſuch
as be dangerous, with the other which do promiſe greater ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie.
For if thoſe which are dangerous do vanquiſh and ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
the ſtrength and vigour of nature, either by their force or
number, then mayeſt thou boldly pronounce, that danger is
not farre from the doore. And againe on the contrary, if ſuch as
do promiſe ſecuritie be of greater power then the former, then
ſhall the ſicke eſcape out of the deepe danger of <hi>Scylla</hi> and <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rybdis,</hi>
and by the vertue and power of a happy <hi>Criſis,</hi> ſaile forth
into the hauen of health: and that yet more aſſuredly, if in the
meane time perfect ſignes of concoction ſhall appeare. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
ſuch ſignes ſome are called <hi>Decretorie,</hi> or <hi>Iudicatorie;</hi>
other ſignes of cruditie and concoction; others againe do fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell
the ſecuritie or danger of the diſeaſe.<note place="margin">Signes of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction.</note> Now the ſignes of
concoction, after the beginning of the diſeaſe is paſt ouer, and
the humours by meanes of the naturall heate, well concocted,
ſequeſtred, and ſeparated from that which is putride and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt,
do appeare about the time of the increaſing or vigour
of the diſeaſe, in the <hi>vrine, ſpittle, ſuppuration of Impoſtumes,
(which is not vnlike vnto concoction performed in the veines)</hi> as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
in other excretions: for the excretions of euery part of the
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:4002:19"/>
body, as alſo of the humours, which are nothing elſe but the
ſuperfluities and relickes of concoction, do ſhew foorth the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſition
of the ſame. Wherefore in the infirmities of the
cheſt, and inſtruments of reſpiration, a ſpittle white, euen of an
equall conſiſtence, is alwayes a good and laudable ſigne of
concoction. But if the ſicke be not at all able to ſpit out any
thing, then doth it ſhew foorth abſolute cruditie; and if he
ſhould chance to ſpit a ſpittle without any mixture, being thin,
wateriſh, &amp; of a leaden colour, or of the colour of verdigreaſe,
it doth not onely argue cruditie, but doth alſo portend the vtter
ouerthrow of the patient. But the vrine being an excretion of
the ſecond concoction, doth certainly ſhew foorth the crudity
and concoction of the humours contained in the veines, guts,
liuer, and places adioyning, the ſaid parts being annoyed, either
with feauer, inflammation, Scirrhus, or yet any other diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
whatſoeuer. For if the ſame both in colour and ſubſtance be
like vnto ſuch vrines as are vſually ſeene in perfect health, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
a reſidence white, euen, and like vnto well concocted
matter, it doth truly witneſſe vnto vs, not onely the concoction
of the diſeaſe, eſpecially in feauers, but alſo that the naturall
force and power is a great deale ſtronger then the diſeaſe, and
therefore that it is like to obtaine the victorie in the conflict
with the criſis.<note place="margin">Vrine no Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thognomonick ſigne of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction, and yet to be obſerued.</note> But by this meanes the vrine is no Pathogno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monicke
ſigne, and yet a neceſſarie ſigne of concoction and
cruditie, and worth the obſeruing in feauers, diſeaſes of the
neather belly or intrails, and places adioyning to them. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Galen</hi> in the expoſition of the predictions of <hi>Hippocrates,</hi>
doth grant, that the vrine doth ſhew foorth and demonſtrate
the ſtate and diſpoſition of the parts of the liuer, kidneyes, and
bladder; as likewiſe of the ſtrength or weakneſſe of the veſſels
containing the bloud, and of the naturall power and vertue
which is the ingenderer of the humours: howbeit the ſame
<hi>Galen</hi> againe affirmeth, that there are other Pathognomonicke
ſignes belonging to the braines, lungs, mother, ſinewes, &amp;c.
And yet notwithſtanding, might one, not without cauſe, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouch,
that the vrine giueth notice of ſome infirmities of the
place through which it paſſeth, not primarily and principally,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:4002:19"/>
but by accident, to wit, by reaſon of the contents thereof, which
are nothing elſe but excretions proceeding from thoſe parts
which do conueigh and carrie the vrine. Wherefore <hi>Hippocra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi>
witneſſeth,<note place="margin">Praenot. lib. ex e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit. Preſ. vel prognoſt. 2. ex e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit. Heur. &amp; lib. de natura homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis circa finem.</note> that if any do void by vrine, either <hi>grauell, or little
thinne ſcurfe, or matter like vnto ſcales, or courſeſt dreſſings of bran,
little gobbets of fleſh, congealed bloud, matter or ſmall haires or
threeds, like vnto the ſmall veines knit together vnder the creuices
taile;</hi> theſe things declare that the bladder is annoyed with a
ſcab, and the kidneyes with the ſtone, ſuppuration, the rup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of ſome veine, or ſome other infirmitie. But leſt any ſhould
raſhly apply the ſignes of vrine to any other then the aforena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
diſeaſes, this famous father of Phyſitians doth adde imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly:
<hi>Take heed therefore leſt thou be deceiued, the party making
ſuch an vrine when the bladder is amiſſe; for then ſuch vrines belong
not to the whole body, but ought to be referred to the bladder onely.</hi>
There is yet another fearefull and dangerous diſeaſe belonging
to the kidneyes,<note place="margin">Diabete.</note> called <hi>Diabete</hi> or <hi>Poldropſy;</hi> being an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie
fluxe of the vrine, called of the Greekes by reaſon of
this vnſatiable deſire of drinking <hi>Dipſacus.</hi> This diſeaſe is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable
to the diſeaſe called <hi>Lienteria:</hi> and for this cauſe they
are continually forced to drinke, all which being nothing at all
changed, in colour, ſubſtance, or in ſmell, they do voide forth
againe as they receiued it, and that by reaſon of the imbecillity
of the returning and altering powers and faculties of the kid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neyes.
Now that ſuch an vrine is the proper and pathognomo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicke
ſigne of this diſeaſe, no man of vnderſtanding, I thinke,
will denie. Followeth now the third ſort of ſignes of conco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of ſuperfluities, to wit, the excretions of the bellie, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
to the firſt concoction; the which being ſoft, faſhio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
according to the concauitie of the guts, and ſomewhat
faſtened or ſtiffe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> being alſo voyded at the accuſtomed time,
and anſwering in proportion to the food receiued: then, as ſaith
<hi>Hippocrates,</hi> they do ſhew forth and declare the ſtrength of the
naturall faculties of the ſtomacke, together with the good di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion
thereof. Theſe three ſorts of ſuperfluities then giue par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
notice of the proper ſtate and diſpoſition of ſuch parts of
the bodie as they paſſe thorow, together with the ſtrength of
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:4002:20"/>
the naturall powers: and firſt the ſuperfluities of the meate do
argue and declare the force and ſtrength of the ſtomacke. For
this cauſe the Emperour <hi>Antoninus</hi> his groomes of his ſtable
did daily both taſte and ſmell to the ordure of his ſtately horſe,
knowne by his greene furniture, to know whether he had well
digeſted his food or not. Now the vrines are ſignes of the ſtate
of the bloud in the <hi>veines,</hi> and diſpoſition of the <hi>Liuer,</hi> which
is appointed to be the hote harth or kitchin for concoction of
the humours. The ſpittle in diſeaſes of the cheſt, is vnto vs a
ſigne and token of concoction or cruditie: and thoſe of the firſt
ſort, to wit, of cruditie, are for the moſt part euill, and often
proue very dangerous: the others againe are often meſſengers
of an healthfull and long looked for <hi>criſis:</hi> whence is this ſaying
of <hi>Hippocrates: Concoction doth portend and ſignifie both the ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſſe
of the criſe and aſſured health: but on the contrarie, cruditie
doth menace and threaten either the breaking forth of ſome tumour,
or great ſwelling, or elſe ſome great paine or griefe, or yet a relapſe
into the ſame diſeaſe againe.</hi> There are yet many moe decretorie
ſignes which concerne the future <hi>criſe,</hi> as alſo diuerſe progno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticke
ſignes foreſhewing life or death, the full explication of
which would rather require a great volume then an Epiſtle (the
which haue bene exactly deſcribed by <hi>Hippocrates,)</hi> but eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
the intricate ſignes of prediction by the pulſe, as alſo the
ſignes both of the diſeaſe it ſelfe, and of the place affected or
intereſſed; the which alſo I willingly paſſe ouer, by reaſon that
their power, force, efficacie, and ſignification, doth depend vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
the ſignes of concoction; neither are there any amongſt all
the ſignes of concoction more neceſſarie for the Phyſitians vſe,
then theſe <hi>pathognomonicke</hi> ſignes. And tell me, I pray thee,
how ſhall the Phyſitian euer be able to cure vncouth and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne
diſeaſes, vnleſſe the <hi>pathognomonicke</hi> ſignes firſt lay
them open to his view and conſideration; in the finding out of
which, the ancients tooke ſo great paines, as hath bene ſaid al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie.
But ſince it is not the worke of the Phyſitian, but of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,

in theſe our countries ſo great and ſo frequent a number of them, which
without any controll or puniſhment, euen in the best Cities and
townes, both wheres and Iewes, as alſo any deſperate villaine, and bold
ignorant Empirickes, do kill and deſtroy the ſimple and ignorant peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.
And all of them by meanes of this ſo neceſſarie a ſigne doth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing

abuſe, that many of good worth amongſt our ſelues, haue required,
and do yet require, not of my ſelfe alone, but of many others alſo both
iudicious and learned Phyſitians, that by the ſole inſpection of the v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine,

we ſhould Prophet-like tell them, whether the vrine be a mans or

yet when as in ſome caſes, with certaine cautions, we do attribute ſome

diſeaſe do much differ from other mens. And yet heare I pray
thee what a learned late writer of no ſmall experience witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth

of a great number of ſuch as were infected with this loathſome

point, my purpoſe is, firſt to propound ſome reaſons againſt the
ſame: and in the next place ſhall march ſome authorities of the
learned: and in the laſt place ſomething ſhall be added out of
mine owne experience. Now in the firſt place, according to
the common rule ſet downe, and confirmed by a number of
learned writers, <hi>That the vrine ordinarily giueth vs notice of ſuch
diſeaſes as are contained within the veines, as alſo of ſuch places
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:4002:27"/>
through which it paſſeth,</hi> it is apparent, that the conception par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipateth
of neither. For in the firſt place, it is apparent and
manifeſt, that the matrix or wombe is none of thoſe parts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
within the veines: neither yet in the next place, doth
the vrine paſſe through the ſame. How then is it poſſible to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
any infirmitie of this part by the vrine? Now beſides,
the bladder and the wombe are two diſtinct and ſeuerall parts,
appropriated to ſeuerall ends and vſes. And put yet the caſe
that ſometimes ſomething might be, by reaſon of the neare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of the two orifices, conueyed through the common paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage,
yet this would but ſeldome come to paſſe. And moreouer
in women with child this conueyance could not be granted, in
regard of the exact ſhutting vp of the aforeſaid paſſage during
the whole time of this burden, inſomuch that the leaſt ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluitie
can then haue no paſſage,<note place="margin">In aphor. 51. &amp; 54. lib. 6 &amp; 3. de natur. facult. cap. 3. 6. de locis af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. cap. 5. 15. de vſu part.</note> as witneſſeth <hi>Galen</hi> in diuers
places. Now if any will deny the truth of this point, in the firſt
place I anſwer, that as I grant that ſometimes there my be,
notwithſtanding that which hath bene ſaid, ſome euacuation
during that time, and that ſome part of the ſame matter might
be conueyed into the bladder, yet this cometh to paſſe but ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
ſeldome, and in a few. And againe, this would make more
againſt them: for all that is by the learned at the moſt granted
in this caſe is, that the vrine may ſometimes declare a retention
and ſtopping of the menſtruous fluxe, whereof if any part du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
their being with child is voyded foorth (as ſometimes
ſome women haue ſome to ſpare) the vrine can no more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
any ſtoppage of this fluxe, and by conſequent nothing
concerning the conception, vnleſſe thou wouldeſt imagine
that there be certaine <hi>ideas</hi> or ſhapes and pictures of young
children conueyed at that time into the vrines of women with
child. And yet if this were true, who told theſe vrine-mongers
that the wombe daunced attendance on the bladder, to voyde
their ſeuerall excretions at one and the ſame time? But put yet
the caſe that ſome part of this menſtruous fluxe, now and then
iſſuing out at the common conduit with the vrine, might ſhew
vs ſomething, yet could it not follow, but that a number of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſignes were alſo neceſſarie, as hereafter ſhall appeare.
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:4002:27"/>
Their chiefe ring-leader <hi>Actuarius</hi> himſelfe, confeſſeth that
the vrine alone is not able to leade vs vnto this truth. Moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
<hi>Ariſtotle</hi> acknowledgeth,<note place="margin">Ariſt. 4. de gener. anim. cap. 6.</note> that the vrines of women with
child do differ according to the time that is paſt ſince the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception;
ſo that there is not one certaine vrine whereon to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
our iudgement. And according to the opinion of diuerſe
others, the vrines of women with child alter almoſt euery day.
One of theſe vrines therefore ſhall neuer giue notice of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception,
although it might be ſometimes diſcerned by the v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine.
And is not this abſurditie, to preſume to know that by one
ſigne, which many ioyned together can hardly declare vnto vs?
Diuerſe contents are ſet downe by ſome authors following
<hi>Auicenna,</hi> which are ſaid to be found in ſuch <hi>vrines,</hi> which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheleſſe,

deſcribeth: and that moreouer he had often obſerued ſuch
contents in mens vrines.</hi> Adde yet this argument to the former,
that the conception, as alſo the further growth of the child in
the wombe, is properly a naturall action, and no diſeaſe at all:
for this cauſe their vrines ought to differ little or nothing from
other healthfull womans waters, eſpecially in the firſt moneths,

child be ſurpriſed with ſome acute diſeaſe, as commeth often to

And if there were any certainty in this ſigne alone, what
needed our Phyſitians trouble themſelues with ſo many? and

that the vrine may giue vt certaine and aſſured notice of a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans

as if he had ſeene a child in the vrine. But of another opinion are all
the ancient Phyſitians, who haue left vs no ſignes of the ſame in the
vrine: as alſo reaſon it ſelfe teacheth vs no leſſe. For ſince the birth or
conception is without the veines, and the vrine chiefly giueth vs no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of ſuch diſeaſes as are contained within the veines, it can giue vs
no certaine aſſurance of this matter, vnleſſe we ioyne therewith all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

Arabian Phyſitians mind, who haue deuiſed certaine contents which
are not to be found in vrines, to wit, certaine grounds like vnto carded
wooll, little motes, &amp;c. No more am I of that opinion, that a Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian
may aſſuredly know by the vrine whether a woman be with child
or no; by reaſon that of all the ſignes which Hippocrates hath in diuers

               <p>The ſame opinion is by his countrey man <hi>Sauonarola</hi> yet ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conded.</p>
               <p>But here we muſt be very circumſpect,<note place="margin">Sauonarola libr. de vrin. cap. 2. rubr. 10. de vrin. praegnantium.</note> in regard that all theſe
ſignes of conception may ſometimes be without the ſame, as in the ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>page

Let yong Phyſitians therefore be carefull, that with the vrine they
ioyne all the other ſignes belonging to conception; amongſt which one
is chiefe, which belongeth to the midwife to find out, &amp;c.</p>

of ſome Phyſitians, that they are perſwaded women with child make
vrines differing from other womens. It is true, that in women with

and kept in, wherefore becauſe the ſame in the firſt moneths eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
not being wholly ſpent on the nouriſhment of the child, as being then
but ſmall, it commeth to paſſe that the action of the ſtomacke, as like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
the appetite, together with the concoction are not a litle troubled.
And therefore being often, by reaſon of their longing deſires, carried
away with a deſire of ſuch things as engender little good nouriſhment,
they engender great ſtore of crudities, which may plainly be ſeene by
their vrines, the which are alſo common to all ſuch as abound in cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities.</p>

               <p>Truth it is, that we muſt not altogether relie vpon the vrine, to

thee no further aſſurance of the ſame, then by the retention of her ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed

ſome preſumption of conception. Now it may eaſily come to paſſe, that
a woman may be ſurpriſed with many infirmities, which may hide and

ſuch as be headach, any cold, eſpecially being accompanied with

                  </gap>, that in the yeare 1555. in the Citie
of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ienna, a certaine friend of mine (ſaith he) called Georgius Ritha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merus,
a man of ſingular learning, being very deſirous of iſſue, came to
one of the Phyſitians of the Colledge of beſt note, bringing with
him his wiues vrine, to know whether ſhe were with child, as he dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
or no. The Phyſitian vpon the bare ſight of the vrine onely, did
peremptorily affirme, that ſhe was for certaine with child, and that of a
boy. After the which time Rithamerus began quite to diſtaſte me;
and that onely by reaſon that vpon the ſight of her vrine, together
with diuers other ſignes and circumſtances thereto belonging, I had
deliuered my opinion, that ſhe was not at all with child. And beſides,
he prouided with all expedition both midwife, nurſe, and all other
things belonging to that buſineſſe. It was afterwards constantly and
confidently euery where noyſed abroad, that ſhe was with child. The
women her attendants by reaſon of ſome accidents wherewith ſhe was
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:4002:29"/>
now and then troubled, appointed her diuerſe baths, by meanes where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
being ſurpriſed with the falling ſickneſſe, ſhe was in a very ſhort
time freed from all the miſeries of this mortall life. Of whoſe death
being aduertiſed, I did very earneſtly intreate the aforeſaid Ritha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merus,
that both in regard of that ancient bond of loue and amitie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
him and me, as likewiſe to finde out the whole truth of this
matter, he would be pleaſed to giue way to the opening of the dead
corps. The which at length, being ouercome, as well by my earneſt
ſuing vnto him, as for the great and earneſt deſire he had to be reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
of the truth of the matter, he did willingly yeeld vnto. In making
the inciſion, we began firſt with the muſcles of the neather bellie, diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uering
ſuch parts as before were hid, &amp; afterwards ripping vp the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritonaeum,
we proceeded to the place where the wombe was ſituate; and
although we did perceiue it to be but very ſmall, and to containe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
within it; yet to the end we might the more clearly ſee the truth
with our eyes, we ript it vp alſo, and found it cleane, and empty of any
thing within it. Now in her life time ſhe was of a whitiſh bleake colour,
and of a cachecticall diſpoſition, and had neuer in all her life time borne
any child: from whence I did by very probable coniccture collect, that
ſhe was troubled with ſome other infirmitie. For the which cauſe we
proceed ſtill in our inciſion towards the ſtomacke; whereas betwixt the
peritonaeum, and the guts we found good ſtore of water, which did ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the motion of the body, fall ſometimes to the right and
ſometimes to the left ſide; and from hence aroſe this erronius opinion
of the ſuppoſed motion of a liue child. This being after this manner
finiſhed, I ſpake after this manner, My good friend George, you ſee
now after what manner your wife proueth with child. And he, ſeeing
the caſe ſo plaine, did ingenuouſly acknowledge, that he had wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
and vndeſeruedly bene offended with me, and withall did freely
acknowledge his errour. Witneſſes with me at this inciſion, were Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor
lacobus Walch, companion with me in my Italian ſtudies; as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
Andreas Perlachius, a great Mathematician, being alſo the onely
man who had ſo ſtedfaſtly maintained that ſhe was with child.</p>
               <p>Now with two inſtances of mine owne experience I will fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
this point.<note place="margin">Hiſtorie of a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man with child in the firſt moneths.</note>
               </p>
               <p>A Gentlewoman dwelling neere Northampton ſome yeares ago,
ſent me her vrine, which in euery reſpect, as well in colour as contents,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:4002:30"/>
reſembled the vrine of an healthfull yong man. Hauing found out by
ſome circumstances that it was a womans, I began to ſuspect that
which afterwards proued true, that ſhe was with child. The meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger
demanding whether ſhe was not entred into a Dropſie: I repli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
I rather enclined to the opinion that ſhe was with child, the which
proued to be true. The ſeruant confeſſed, another Phyſitian had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
put her in needleſſe feare of a Dropſie. The Gentlewoman after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
conceiued a better opinion of my skill in this point, then I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe
it deſerued.</p>
               <p>The ſame Harueſt,<note place="margin">Another of one in the latter moneths.</note> within ſeuen miles of this towne of Northamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,
a Lady great with child, being now within two moneths at moſt
of her deliuerie, ſent me firſt her vrine, and then deſired mine owne
perſonall preſence for ſome infirmitie whereof ſhe then complained.
The vrine ſent reſembled, as the former, the vrine of a luſtie young
man in the Aprill of his age: I obſerued it very narrowly, and yet
could I diſcerne none of thoſe Arabian contents, neither cardedwooll,
flaxe, nor huſwiues cloth. Being afterwards with her, I found no alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
in her vrine, ſaue that it was paler coloured which was made
in the night, and higher coloured which was made in the day time,
contrarie to that which we commonly obſerue; and yet neither of them
exceeding the colour of a cholericke mans vrine. The Gentlewoman
had bene for a long time, euen before her being with child, much
troubled with a hote and feauer-like diſtemper.</p>
               <p>This point then being cleared, we proceed now to the ſexe,

for the diſcerning of the ſexe in thoſe of riper yeares, the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:4002:30"/>
would ſeeme to be more fauourable. The chiefe and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall
reaſon alledged for this is, becauſe men are commonly of
an hoter conſtitution then women, which is the cauſe that their
vrines are dyed of an higher colour; and moreouer, that the
contents in womens vrines, in regard of their idle and ſeden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarie
life, do often exceed mens in quantitie. But this muſt not
ſimply be conſidered, but as we commonly ſay, <hi>caeteris paribus:</hi>
that is, a man of a good and laudable conſtitution of body, v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
diet anſwerable both in quantitie and qualitie, and auoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
idleneſſe: a woman likewiſe of a colder complexion, as
often they are, vſing moderate diet, a ſedentary and lazie life,
auoyding hote diet. If, I ſay, one ſhould bring thee two ſuch
vrines, demanding to know which were the mans and which
the womans, then without great difficultie mighteſt thou giue
out a right verdict. But if one ſhold bring vnto thee two vrines,
the one of a man, the other of a woman, the one not differing
from the other, and the womans perhaps higher in colour and
thinner in ſubſtance, (which may by diuerſe meanes come to
paſſe) thou ſhouldeſt giue wrong ſentence, then being thus
gulled, thou mighteſt be made a gazing ſtocke to thy neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,<note place="margin">Some women of an hoter con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution then men.</note>
by reaſon of thy peremptorie opinion. Now that ſome
women are of an hoter conſtitution of bodie then ſome men, I
thinke who ſo denieth, deſerueth rather to haue his pate purged,
then to be dealt with with by any reaſon. I my ſelfe haue alſo
knowne many a man make paler vrines, with greater quantitie
of contents, then women: which may eaſily come to paſſe, by
reaſon of great quaſſing, daintie fare, and abundance of eaſe
and idleneſſe, the engendrers of all manner of crudities. Haue
we not now adayes more then a good many whoſe God is their

looke, before thou couldſt diſcerne any thing materiall or to
the purpoſe? As for out women, what if their <hi>Liuer</hi> and <hi>Kid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neyes</hi>
be hote, as I haue not ſeldome obſerued, may not this
bring forth an high water? and will not obſtructions eaſily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priue
it of contents. But eſpecially if theſe women be well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with a pipe of Tobacco, a cup of good ſherry Sacke,

with ſugar, nutmegge and ginger, may it not now and then not
onely colour the vrines, but make their faces flouriſh with ſome
orientall carbuncles and rubies? Beſides the former reaſons,
will not faſting, watching, perturbations of the mind, diet in
quantitie and qualitie, with diuerſe other things moe, alter the
vrine as well in man as in woman? It were, perhaps, an eaſier
matter to obſerue this difference in ſome hoter climat then our
owne, to wit, in <hi>France, Spaine,</hi> or <hi>Italy,</hi> where women drinke
more water then with vs; eſpecially in <hi>Italie,</hi> where the women
are caged vp like linnets to ſing, and are not ſo buſie with the
fruite of the grape, nor with the ſtrong barley water as our <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh</hi>
women. If I ſhould inſtance alſo in our virgins, more man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
then many men, how were any able to contradict it? But
if I ſhould ſend to the cunningeſt piſſe-prophet in this king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
the vrine of ſome <hi>Hermaphrodite</hi> or man-woman, what
would or could they ſay? and to which of the ſexes would they
aſcribe the vrine? Now that ſome ſuch are to be found, cannot
be denied. It hath bene holden for a truth in all ages: and of late
yeares a learned Phyſitian hath written a booke concerning
that ſubiect,<note place="margin">Gaſpar. Bauhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus de Herma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phroditis.</note> where he bringeth in a number of hiſtories of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
and later times. I haue bene alſo credibly informed of
ſome ſuch who haue liued here in theſe parts of the countrey.
But if the woman ſhall be ſurpriſed with any hote and acute
diſeaſe (as the vrine is ſeldome ſent to the Phyſitian but in ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe)
will not theſe confound thy iudgement? Now if the ſexe
cannot be diſcerned by the vrine in perſons of yeares, what ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurditie
is it to demand the knowledge hereof in a woman with
child, where the conception it ſelfe cannot be thereby diſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned?
as alſo where there are ſo many rubs in the way. It is alſo
worth the obſeruation, that whereas that learned <hi>Mercatus</hi>
diſcourſeth of all the ſignes whereby one may know whether
a woman be with child of a male or female, where he omitteth
not ſo much as the blowing of the wind, yet ſpeaketh he not ſo
much as one word concerning the vrine: no more do many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

otherwiſe were entailed to the next heires male. This Parſon being

of her, whether ſhe did not complaine of any inward diſtemper of
heate; who replyed, that ſhe complained of no diſtemper at all. But
within a few dayes ſhe found that diſtemper in ſuch a meaſure, as ſhe
was glad to admit both of Phlebotomie and other fit and neceſſarie
remedies. The conſtitution of her bodie is hote, and her vrine anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably
high coloured, vnleſſe it be accidentally hindered. And this I
dare boldly affirme, that during her huſbands ſickneſſe, being a long
and tedious, firſt Tertian, then double Tertian feauer, yet neuer ſaw
I his vrine of ſo high and intenſe a colour as that of hers lately
mentioned.</p>
               <p>And now I hope it doth plainly appeare, that neither the
conception, nor ſexe can be by the vrine onely diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned.
Let vs now proceed to the exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
and Anatomie of the vrine it

of the vrine, &amp;c. And yet the ſame Author maintaineth the

regions of the bodie, which I will here confute as moſt
falſe and erronious.<note place="margin">Hieron. Reuſ. ſchol. ad cap. prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict. prope finem.</note> Now to this purpoſe I thinke it will not
be amiſſe, to ſet downe the words of his interpreter, which may
ſerue ſufficiently to ouerthrow this error: <hi>Hence may it euidently
appeare, in how great an error thoſe Phyſitians are inuolued, who
hold a proportion betwixt the height of the vrine and of a mans bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die.
Hence alſo cometh it to paſſe, that they affirme that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents
of the vppermoſt region do declare and lay open the griefes of
the head, &amp;c. Did thoſe men euer ſee fat fall to the bottome or mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
region of the vrinall? Doth not oyle and any fat thing commonly
and of its owne accord ſwim vpon the top of the vrine? Neither yet
doth it therefore neceſſarily follow, that the head is principally affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted;
but doth declare and ſhew foorth, either the waſting of the
whole bodie, or ſome diſeaſes of the kidneyes. Let them ſhew vs the
reſidence called</hi> hypoſtaſis, <hi>in the garland or vppermost part of the
vrine. The like may be ſaid concerning the bubbles which do alwayes
ſtay vpon the top of the vrine,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Aphor. 34. lib. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>and according to the doctrine of Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrates,
do Prognoſticate ſome long and lingring diſeaſe of the kid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neyes.
To what end and purpoſe then keepe they ſuch aprating, that
the bubbles which do in order compaſſe the whole crowne or garland
about, do declare ſome great paine in the whole head: and if they
compaſſe and enuiron but the halfe of the circle or garland, then do
they argue a paine but in one ſide of the head? How often are ſuch
people pained with the wind Colicke or Hypochondriacke melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly?
In which caſe howſoeuer ſome wind may aſcend vp into the
head; yet is not this axiome alwayes of vndoubted truth. The like
iudgement may we pronounce concerning other things of the like na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
which moſt commonly follow the condition of their owne natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
inclination and matter, and not the altitude or ſituation of this
or that part of a mans bodie.</hi> Thus farre our Author. And the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
vrine ſo continuing, of the which ſhall be ſpoken in the
next Chapter, may ſerue to ouerthrow the ſuppoſed proportion
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:4002:34"/>
betwixt the regions of the vrine and the body of man; this
headach being diſcerned by the whole body of the vrine, and
neither by the circle or garland, nor yet by any bubbles, ſpume,
or froth in the top of the ſame. But concerning the vncertainty
of theſe particulars, as alſo concerning the crowne and gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
hereafter when we ſhall ſpeake of the contents of vrines,
I purpoſe to diſcourſe at greater length. It is now time we
come to the ſubſtance of vrines, and then to all the parts of
the ſame.</p>
               <p>I will with the learned <hi>Mercuriall,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Diuiſion of the vrine.</note> diuide the whole vrine
into three parts, the ſubſtance, the accidents, and the contents.
In the ſubſtance againe we are to conſider, whether the vrine be
thicke or thinne,<note place="margin">Of the ſubſtance of vrines.</note> and whether cleare, or troubled and muddie.
And this we vnderſtand of the whole bodie of the vrine. Thin
vrines according to <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>aſſeus</hi> haue manifold ſignifications.<note place="margin">Diuerſe ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations of thin vrines.</note> Firſt
a failing of naturall heate. Secondly, a ſtoppage of the Liuer,
kidneyes,<note place="margin">Iohannes Vaſſeus Meldenſ. lib. de vrin. iudicijs. pag. 30. &amp;c.</note> and the vrinarie veſſels. Thirdly, weakneſſe of nature.
Fourthly, that the attractiue power of the paſſage or pipes of the
vrine is endamaged. Fiftly, extreame coldneſſe ioyned with
drought. In acute diſeaſes it argueth: Firſt the weakneſſe of the
concocting facultie. Secondly, the cruditie of the diſeaſe, and
of the humours contained in the veines. Thirdly, if it thus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
for a long time, death, if nature be not able to hold out:
&amp; if ſtrength continue, ſome abſceſſe or Impoſtume in the nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
parts. And in a Criſis threateneth a relapſe, as in <hi>Hermo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates
3. Epid.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Hippocr. 3. Epid.</note> Now how ſhall any by the bare inſpection of
theſe vrines, be able to know whether it hath long thus conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
or no, which neuertheleſſe maketh much for a true pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction?
The partie ſeldome taketh notice of it, vntill ſuch time
it be ſent to the Phyſitian. The meſſenger employed, oftentimes
hath not ſeene the partie ſince the beginning of his ſickneſſe,
much leſſe his vrine. Thinne vrines which afterwards turne
thicke in an acute diſeaſe,<note place="margin">Sauonar. lib. de vrin. cap. 3.</note> ſaith <hi>Sauonarola,</hi> without any eaſe or
alleutation enſuing, ſignifieth a waſting away of the whole bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die,
&amp;c. But concerning thinne vrines, which afterwards turne
thicke, ſomething ſhall be further ſaid, when we ſhall ſpeake of
thicke vrines. And concerning thinne vrines in generall, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:4002:34"/>
I ſhall haue ſome further occaſion to ſpeake hereafter
when I ſhall handle the colours, I will not dwell ſo long vpon
this point. But now come we to the thicke vrines.</p>

                  </note> Firſt the combat or fight betwixt nature and

ſlime and the other parts next vnto it, by reaſon of cold,
if thinne vrine went before.<note place="margin">Significations of thicke vrines.</note> Fourthly, the beginning of conco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
ſuch in the fit of an Ague ſo continuing. Fiftly, the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of the ſtrength, and no ſmall ſtore of humours. The ſame
Author againe diuideth theſe thicke vrines into two ſorts:<note place="margin">Diuiſion of thicke vrines.</note> 
                  <hi>into
thicke transparent, pellucide, and troubled,</hi> called by him <hi>turbida.</hi>
This firſt ſort ſignifieth (ſaith he) a diſſoluing or melting of
glaſſie phlegme, as we ſee in the vrines of <hi>Epilepticke</hi> perſons
proceeding of phlegme. If it be of a citrine or yellowiſh co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour,<note place="margin">Of thicke trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled vrines.</note>
it ſignifieth choller, like the yolkes of egges. But becauſe
the other ſort of thicke vrines called <hi>turbida,</hi> or troubled and
muddie, is more obuious to the eye, and eaſilier diſcerned, I
will inſiſt a little the longer vpon the ſame.<note place="margin">Their ſeuerall ſignifications.</note> The ſame Author
aſſigneth three ſignifications to ſuch vrines. Firſt, a great agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and ſtirring of crude and vnconcoct humours, together
with no ſmall ſtore of windineſſe. Secondly, abundance of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours,
which neuertheleſſe are by nature expelled. Thirdly, the
great trouble and encombrance nature hath in the expelling
and ſequeſtring ſuch humours.<note place="margin">Diuiſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of thick troubled vrines.</note> But theſe troubled thicke vrines
are yet diuided into three ſeuerall ſorts. Firſt, ſome being thinne
at the firſt making, do afterwards thicken: others are made
thicke, and after a while ſettle: and finally, ſome are made thick,
and do ſo continue, being like vnto horſe-piſſe. Such vrines
(ſaith <hi>Ranzouius)</hi> as are made thinne,<note place="margin">Henricus Ranzo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius lib. de con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerannda vale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tud. cap. 19.</note> ſometimes ſuddenly thic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
and grow troubled: this in health cometh often to paſſe
after exerciſe, and to others after ſickneſſe. <hi>And after I haue
drunke hard</hi> (ſaith the ſame Author) <hi>I make a cleare vrine, which
in a very ſhort time groweth thicke, and ſo ſetleth to a great reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</hi>
Others hold that it ſignifieth, that nature now beginneth
to ſet vpon the humor, and to concoct it. I haue often obſerued
ſuch an vrine, both in perfect health and before and after ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:4002:35"/>
Cold winter weather alſo often altereth thinne vrines in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
thicke. Such as are made thicke at firſt, and after ſettle to a
thicke reſidence, and become cleare, ſignifie and declare vnto
vs, that the diſeaſe waſteth away; as declaring nature now to
make a ſeparation, after which it expelleth at a place conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient.
Vrines made thicke at the firſt, and ſo perſiſting, are ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
accounted,<note place="margin">Aph. 10. lib. 4.</note> and that not without cauſe, the worſt of the

if ſtrength decay, it is an infallible token of death: and that by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of the agitation and motion of the matter within the bodie, and

by a common error, which many as well in towne as countrey
do hold, to wit, that when they ſee ſuch a thicke vrine ſtaine
the vrinall, they are incontinent conceited all the danger of
the diſeaſe is paſt. But this to be moſt falſe, I haue often my
ſelfe obſerued, and no doubt ſo haue a many moe beſides my
ſelfe. <hi>Reuſner</hi> maketh this one of his ſignes to know whether
the vrine were thinne at the firſt making or no: for if it were ſo,
then when it thickeneth, it commonly ſtaineth the vrinall.
Now when the ſtrength holdeth out, the patient may recouer,
and not otherwiſe. I will inſtance in one onely, in whom I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued
the vanitie of this opinion, and ſhall ſerue in ſtead of a
many to iuſtifie my aſſertion.</p>
               <p>Some nine or ten yeares ago,<note place="margin">Hiſtorie.</note> I was ſollicited to affoord my preſence
and beſt counſell to a Parſon, dwelling within ſome foure miles of the
towne of Northampton, ſurpriſed with a burning feauer. Hauing
diligently enquired what remedies he had hitherto vſed (for if I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
right, it was the tenth day of his diſeaſe) and by whoſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription,
I learned that no leſſe then three at leaſt, if not foure Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon-Phyſitians
had adminiſtred to him, and then the moſt famous for
<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>romancie of all the countrey about: howbeit ſince that time ſome
others are alſo crept into that ſocietie. I enquired moreouer whether
Phlebotomie had bene as yet vſed. They replyed that Phlebotomie
had not bene ſo much as once mentioned by any of them, but that they
had purged him, as I thinke with Diaprunum, and I remember not
what elſe, and appointed him ſome cooling drinkes. His wife added
moreouer, that one of them thinking to purchaſe himſelfe ſome praiſe
beyond his fellowes, would haue bribed Death with foue pounds worth

vrged ſtill the payment of the debt he came to demand. I told them
that Phlebotomie, in due and conuenient time adminiſtred, had proued
a more ſoueraigne medicine for this diſeaſe, then all the gold of Ophir
and both the Indies. I being by them much importuned to let him
bloud, abſolutely refuſed, his ſtrength being now well nigh ſpent, and
ſome ill ſignes (the vndoubted harbingers of death) offering them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:4002:36"/>
to my eyes, adminiſtring onely ſome cordials. The next mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
I find all waxe worſe and worſe; howbeit his wife, ſhewing me his
vrine, which before had bene thinne, and now ſetled to a thicke reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
a part whereof did ſticke to the ſides of the vrinall and ſtaine
the ſame, which ſhe, beleeuing her neighbours, began to conceiue
ſome better hope of his recouerie, and that onely vpon this falſe
ground. I aſſured her of the contrary, which ſhortly afterwards pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
too true, and the ſame day, being Saturday I departed. The
Monday after comes one of his former Phyſitians (not the Parſon
who miniſtred Aurum Potabile; for after the ſame he had no moe ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes
left in his quiuer) who, if faire buttered ſpeeches and perempto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
promiſes could cure diſeaſes, he might cure more then euer did the
Apoſtles: who then all too late letteth his patient bloud, who ſurui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
not long after the loſſe of this liquor of life, but dyed either that
night, or the next morning very early, being about the fourteenth day
from the beginning of his diſeaſe. <hi>One thing I muſt yet adde con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the ſignification of thicke vrines, which deſerueth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Abſurd opinion of a Phyſitian, affirming one to be bewitched by the vrine onely.</note>
                  <hi>to wit,</hi> That a Phyſitian maintained, that he could
know by the vrine that any were bewitched: <hi>to wit, that ſuch a ones
vrine was thicke and muddie, and could not by any heate be
turned, as they terme it. To whom it was no leſſe learnedly
then truly replyed,</hi> Did you neuer reade in Hippocrates of vrina
confuſa? <hi>I cannot but much maruell, that any man that had euer
ſuckt in the principles and grounds of Phyſicke, ſhould be ſo
farre ouerſeene, this being a peculiar propertie of ſuch vrines,
that they will not be turned by any heate whatſoeuer. It is then
apparent, how little certaintie is to be collected concerning
the iudgement of diſeaſes, by the ſole inſpection either of thick
or thinne vrines: to wit, that after many cautions and diuers
interrogations, if thou meete with an vnderſtanding meſſenger,

                  <hi>And that thou mayest yet be more rauiſhed
with admiration, Rufus Epheſus in his booke of the infirmitie of the

ſpace of twelue yeares voyded all his vrine by the bellie, and not by the
ordinarie paſſage. What then could a man haue iudged concerning this
mans bladder, and the other parts depending thereupon?</hi> And this

                  <hi>The next accident of vrine is the qualitie: and the qualities,

as witneſſeth</hi> Mercuriale,<note place="margin">Mercur. lib. de vrin. cap. 6.</note> 
                  <hi>according to the doctrine of the</hi> Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bian
Phyſitians,<note place="margin">Of the ſmell of vrines.</note> 
                  <hi>are fiue: the ſmell, the taſt, the ſound, the touch,

                  <note place="margin">Vrines without ſmell.</note> 
                  <hi>or finally a ſtinking ſmell. No

the extinguiſhing of naturall heate: howbeit it may ſometimes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
from drinke of a cold qualitie, like as we ſee in cold countries, and
the like complexions,<note place="margin">Vrines ſmelling well.</note> the ſmell of the vrine is not ſo much to be diſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.
<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rines ſmell well, either in regard of diet or drugs: but eſpecially

by foure ſeuerall meanes. 1. By meanes of cruditie and indigestion
of the food. 2. By reaſon of putrefaction. Galen witneſſeth, that
whatſoeuer thing is putrified hath an euill fauoured ſmell.<note place="margin">Galen lib. 5. de ſimplie. med. facult.</note> Wherefore
in Peſtilentiall feauers the vrines are moſt commonly of a ſtinking
ſmell. As alſo if the vrines paſſe through any place oppreſſed with pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trid
vlcers; or yet if any purulent matter be mingled with them, they
become ſtinking. 3. The too long retention of vrine in the bladder
may make it to ſtinke. 4. The qualitie either of diet or drugs, (as
hath bene ſaid of the good ſmell of vrines) may likewiſe procure vnto
it an euill ſmell.<note place="margin">Lib. de vrin. cap. 3. rub. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>Looke at large what</hi> Sauonarola <hi>ſaith of this
point, if thou be diſpoſed to ſee further. But what certaintie
doth the ſmell of the vrine affoord vs? whoſoeuer ſhall thinke
to helpe his vncertaine coniectures by the ſame,</hi> ſhould leape out
of the frying pan (as the prouerbe ſaith) into the fire. <hi>In the firſt
place it is to be obſerued, that as well in ſickneſſe as in health,
vrines may offer no pleaſing ſmell to the noſe, and yet the party
may be free from any danger at al. But becauſe healthfull folkes
ſeldome ſend their vrines to the Phyſitian, we will let them
paſſe,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Loco prius cita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to.</note> 
                  <hi>and come to the ſicke. I will let</hi> Scribonius <hi>ſpeake for me.</hi>
Concerning the ſicks vrine (ſaith he) moſt do teach vs that ſtinking
vrines ſignifie putrefaction of humours, in ſo much that by the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
of the ſmels, they take vpon them to iudge of the ſeuerall hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours
ſo putrified. <hi>O wiſe woodcockes!</hi> I willingly yeeld to them,
that ſtinke or ſtrong ſmell doth argue putrefaction in ſuch vrines: but
of which parts ſhall this putrefaction be? whether of the bladder onely,
or of the Liuer alſo, of the chest, or other members? Nay ſo farre off
is the ſtinking ſmell from giuing vs any particular notice of the diſeaſe,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:4002:38"/>
that it cannot ſo much as affoord vs any certaine generall knowledge
of the ſame. For many ſweet ſmelling ſimples (ſaith Montanus) may
cauſe a most ſtinking vrine. Cholericke and hote complexioned men
void often very ſtrong ſmelling vrines, howſoeuer free fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> any diſeaſe,
as I haue often obſerued in my ſelfe. And by what meanes, I pray thee,
ſhouldſt thou from the ſtinking ſmell of the vrine know putrefaction?
or how can this putrefaction procure this ſtinking ſmell? If this were
ſo, then would it neceſſarily follow, that whoſoeuer were ſeiſed with a
feauer proceeding from putrefaction of humours, ſhould voyd ſtinking
vrines, the which is most falſe. The truth of this aſſumption may
from hence appeare, that for the moſt part among an hundred ſicke of
ſuch feauers, ſcarce ſhalt thou find one of their vrines ſo to ſmell, nor
yet their bloud at the opening of a veine. And for this cauſe well ſaid
Sauonarola in his treatiſe of Vrines, that there are other ſignes alſo
to be obſerued in the annoying of putrified members, if we purpoſe well
and orderly to examine, trie and finde out any skill concerning vrines.
And indeed a thouſand cauſes there are which may alter and change
their ſmell. By the ſmell then onely there can neuer be any certaintie
collected to informe our iudgements concerning any diſeaſe. <hi>But I am
afraid the Reader will take it ill, that I ſo long detaine him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
ſo vnpleaſing ſmels;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Medici certe de hac iudicandi ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione ſcribentes digni eſſent, qui in dies lotium potare cogeren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur.

ſhould yet enter vpon the taſt, I feare I ſhould be worſe taxed.
I can tell no man their taſt by mine owne experience. Salt they
haue alwayes bene counted; as the teares likewiſe: If any be
incredulous I will not hinder him. If our vrinemongers had no
better beere allowed them, they would not ſo much adore the
piſſepot as ſome of them do.</hi>

they may more eaſily deceiue ſuch as will be caught in their

For oftentimes when they make the faireſt ſhew, doth not
euen death knocke at the doore? My purpoſe is not here to
make any phyloſophicall diſcourſe concerning the cauſes of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours
in generall, and then to apply the ſame to vrines in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular,
and ſo to inſiſt vpon each ſeuerall colour: for this might
proue too tedious, and perhaps, not ſo pertinent to the purpoſe
we haue in hand. And yet, notwithſtanding, I will ſay ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of each of the chiefe and principall colours; by the which
it may more eaſily be conceiued, that the like deceit may be
ſeene in the others like vnto them.<note place="margin">Palew and light ſaffron colour.</note> Now my purpoſe is to begin
with that colour which is the beſt of all others, being as it were
the rule and ſquare whereby we do diſcerne and iudge of the
failings and defects of all the reſt. This colour is called in Latin
<hi>Subrufus, ſubaureus,</hi> or <hi>ſubcroceus:</hi> and in Engliſh, palew, or
light ſaffron. This colour our Phyſitians do generally account
the beſt of all others, and that it beſt betokeneth exact conco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.
Neither yet muſt this firſt and beſt colour arguing good
concoction, be ſimply and in it ſelfe ſo conſidered, but reſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to flouriſhing age. For in old men, women and children,
(whoſe vrines, eſpecially childrens, do commonly decline to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
white and pale) it doth betoken that their bodies are too
hote, either by reaſon of diet, exerciſe or ſome other meanes.
But if one ſhould bring vnto thee ſuch an vrine, how couldſt
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:4002:39"/>
thou tell whether it were an old or a yong mans, a womans or a
childs, the meſſenger not acquainting thee with the particular
circumſtances? It may be thou wilt ſay, the contents will make
the caſe cleare. I anſwer, that many cauſes may depriue them of
contents in part or altogether, as hereafter ſhall appeare in the
contents: and how the ſubſtance may alter, hath bene ſaid alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die.
The common opinion is, the higher the colour is, the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
heat is argued; which opinion to be moſt falſe &amp; erronious,
ſhall hereafter in other colours appeare. Beſides, may not a little
extraordinarie watching, faſting, <hi>rheubarb, ſaffron, madder roots,</hi>
or ſuch like, colour the vrine without any exceſſe of heat? And
will the ſeuerall ſeaſons of the yeare produce no alteration in
the vrine? that I ſay nothing of an infinite number of other cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
which may in like manner alter them. But one ſignification
of ſuch a coloured vrine I cannot here paſſe by, which I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
I once read in an Engliſh vrine booke:<note place="margin">Called the key of vnknowne knowledge, or a ſhop of fiue windowes.</note> to wit, that a maide
which maketh an vrine of this colour, deſireth the companie of
a man. Doth not our maiſter vrine-monger now diue into the
depth of the matter? But good man, I know what, I can aſſure
thee that <hi>Tom</hi> and <hi>Dicke</hi> in the countrey can tell as well, that
<hi>Maud</hi> the dairy maide would be married, by the reflected rayes
and benigne aſpects of her ſuperiour orbs vpon their hemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſphaers,
and the ſuffering ſome ſyllibub; and ſome other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities
committed to her cuſtodie, now and then to come
into their poſſeſſion; by this meanes hindering her miſtreſſe to
further her ſelfe in her ſuite: as the moſt cunning piſſe-prophet
in all the countrie ſhall do by the vrine, if he had as many eyes
as euer had that watchfull <hi>Argus,</hi> or his noſe weighed downe
with ſpectacles. The <hi>ſanguine</hi> and beſt complexioned (which by
conſequence ſhould produce the beſt vrines) are not alwayes
the moſt amorous. Many as ill coloured drabs as euer any hath

Gentlewoman in the land in ſuch a caſe. And it is held by many

experience.</p>
               <p>The iudgement of diſeaſes by the ſole inſpection of the vrine, is hard
to attaine vnto, and of great difficultie: for ſometimes it commeth to
paſſe that the vrine, as well in colour as in all other points, doth ſhew it
ſelfe of a very laudable conditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the view of any indicious eye, when,
notwithſtanding, death ſtandeth at the doore: the reaſon of this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that all diſeaſes are not eaſily diſcerned, nor yet the dangers of
them perceiued by the vrine alone; but ſuch eſpecially as haue their
being in the bladder, veines, kidneyes and Liuer. As it came to paſſe
anno 1581. in a yong man about 24. yeares of age newly married.
This yong mans vrine being, as well in colour as contents, moſt like vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
an healthfull vrine, he being neither depriued of his accuſtomed
appetite, either to meate or drinke, neither troubled with exceſſiue
headeach, thirſt, watching, anxiety and toſſing of his body too and
fro; nor yet diſtempered with any noyſome heate which might by fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
be diſcerned. The pulſe notwithſtanding, being weake, frequent
and ſwift with great inequalitie and feebleneſſe, gaue vs ſome
coniectures of I know not what kinde of feauer, the which now and
then was not without ſome exacerbations. Hence was I of opinion,
that the vitall facultie did then by little and little decay; the vſe and
neceſſitie whereof in euery action of this life is, not without great cauſe,

Authors do here mention, attributing to each
of them a ſeuerall ſignification; of all which, it
were too much this ſhort Treatiſe ſhould take
vpon it to diſcourſe; conſidering alſo that the
vncertaintie of the ſame may be partly colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
from that which hath bene ſaid alreadie, and partly by
ſome things yet to be handled hereafter: now I will cleare this
point concerning red vrines. This colour of vrine, howbeit it
hath many degrees, ſome being of an higher, and ſome againe
of a lower coloured red: yet (ſaith <hi>Galen)</hi> all are coloured with
a greater or ſmaller portion of bloud therewith mingled. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheleſſe,
that this ſame colour of vrine is procured by the
mixture, more or leſſe, not of bloud alone, but alſo of an high co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loured
choller, ioyntly or ſeuerally according to the greater or
ſmaller quantitie thereof, is not by a ſmall number of learned
Phyſitians maintained: as alſo that this ſame colour of vrine is
often and vſually ſeene in hote and acute diſeaſes, is not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne
to the very vulgar and vnlearned ſort of people. Now
a many cauſes may bring foorth this effect: this colour of vrine
higher or lower appearing in a many hote and acute diſeaſes;
which would puzzle a good Phyſitian, by the bare ſight of ſuch
an vrine,<note place="margin">Dangerous to let bloud vpon the bare ſight of an high red coloured vrine.</note> to know what diſeaſe it were. But yet is not this rule
ſo infallibly true, that it admitteth of no exception, as is the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
of many. And therefore moſt erroneous and dangerous
is the practiſe of ſuch, as vpon the bare ſight of an high colou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red

of circumſtances, both preſcribe Phlebotomie, and adminiſter
all maner of cooling medicines, to the great &amp; ineuitable dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
and preiudice of the patient: from the which errour alſo
the learned <hi>Arabian Auicenna</hi> is not free, as our learned late
writers haue well obſerued. And as I deny not but that this
may often prooue true; ſo on the other ſide, it is moſt certaine,
that the vrine may be of ſuch a colour, and yet either proceed
from a cold cauſe, or elſe from ſome imbecillitie and weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
as cometh ſomtimes to paſſe in Dropſies, &amp;c. But leſt this
ſhould ſeeme ſtuffe of mine owne braine, and hatched at home,
heare from the mouth of a worthie Author,<note place="margin">Rhamb. Dod. ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruat. medic. cap. 32.</note> ſomething con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the ſame purpoſe. <hi>It is not ſeldome obſerued, that the vrine,
by reaſon of a commixtion of bloud with it, doth appeare of a red co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour:
but by reaſon that it is either thicke or clotted, it is no great
difficultie to diſcerne the ſame. But that ſo thinne a bloud ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mingled
with it, that not the ſubſtance of the vrine, but the colour
onely ſhould be altered, is but ſeldome ſeene. Such a caſe befell a young
man of 28. yeares of age or neare by.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This young man voided an vrine of an high red colour,<note place="margin">Hiſtorie.</note> and thinne
ſubſtance for many dayes together, being very like to the vrines made
in hote acute feauers. The aforeſaid patient had vſed the aduice of
diuers ancient learned Phyſitians, who had appointed him ſuch
meanes as are vſed for the cooling of hote Liuers. At length he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired
to my ſelfe, at that time but a young Phyſitian. Looking on
his vrine, and withall ſeeing it of ſo high a red colour, as alſo percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
him, who was there preſent, free from any feauer, I asked him
whether heretofore he had complained of any: which he denyed, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
moreouer, that for ſome moneths by-paſt he had felt a chilneſſe
and coldneſſe, together with a great extenuation or leanneſſe, and
ſhortneſſe of breath, ioyned with a generall decay of ſtrength; as alſo
that hitherto he had found no benefit by ſuch meanes as he had vſed.
All which hauing attentiuely heard, I thought good to keepe by me
the ſaid vrine vntill the next day, and then to view the reſidence
thereof, the which was of a colour like vnto bloud, as being indeed no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
elſe but bloud, the vrine aboue it, being but very little, dyed
with a pale yellow colour; ſhewing no ſigne or token at all of any feauer.
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:4002:42"/>
For the which cauſe I did then collect, that there was no exorbitant
heate in his Liuer, but a great weakeneſſe in the kidneyes, by reaſon
whereof the ends of the ſmall veines being opened and looſened, let
ſome part of the bloud paſſe away. And therefore I tooke a new courſe
for curing of the ſame, by vſing ſuch meanes as were fit for the corro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borating
and ſtrengthening of the kidneyes and veines, not omitting
fit and conuenient diet, and among other things, goats milke. And ſo
at length the vrine came to its owne naturall colour againe, his bodie
alſo enioying the benefit of nouriſhment as it was wont in former
times: and thus in a ſhort time recouered his vigour, ſtrength, and
former perfect health againe.</p>
               <p>Such an excretion of bloud,<note place="margin">Idem D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>d. in ſchol.</note> which cometh thus to paſſe by
reaſon of the looſeneſſe and wideneſſe of the mouthes of the
ſmall veines, or yet of the thinneſſe of bloud, is commonly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Diapedeſis:</hi> that is, as much as a ſtreining through. It cometh
alſo to paſſe, that ſome bloud is voyded by vrine many other
wayes: ſometimes ſome great ſtone fretting the paſſages be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
the kidneyes and the bladder, called <hi>Vreteres,</hi> bloud doth
alſo accompanie the vrine, but withall it is blacke and clotted.
The ſtone continuing for ſome certaine ſpace in the bladder,
prooueth likewiſe ſometimes the cauſe of this inconuenience,
and that eſpecially after riding, or ſome other violent motion of
the bodie. In women alſo ſome part of their menſtruous fluxe
is ſometimes intermingled with it. Sometimes againe the
bloud iſſuing out of the gummes, being ſuddenly ſtopt, doth
ſearch for it ſelfe a paſſage through the bladder. The kidneyes
being wounded, firſt doth bloud iſſue out by the vrines, and
afterwards matter mingled with it: as it befell that woman
which was ſtabbed in the loynes with a dagger, firſt voyding
blouddie vrines; then afterwards mingled with matter, vntill
ſuch time as both the wound and the kidneyes were cured. And
that this was a wound in the kidneyes, did plainly appeare, by
ſome portion of the ſame taken out of the wound. The exulce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of the kidneyes is alſo accompanied with bloudie vrine,
after the which (vnleſſe remedie be in due and conuenient time
procured) matter doth follow. It is likewiſe ſometimes ſeene,
that decrepit old men do voyd vrines mingled with bloud,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:4002:42"/>
which are of a blackiſh colour, accompanied with ſome red, the
which doth declare, that the vigour and power of the kidneyes
is almoſt quite aboliſhed.</p>
               <p>But I wiſh thee yet to lend thine eare a little to the ſame Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor,<note place="margin">Idem obſeruat. medicin. cap. 31.</note>
yet againe in a ſtorie or two more, which will adde not a
little light to this matter.</p>
               <p>The vrine doth appeare of a reddiſh colour, not onely when
the Liuer is ſurpriſed with a Gangrene, or the bodie with any
hote or acute diſeaſe, ſuch as are Tertian agues, burning fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers,
inflammation of the internall parts: but often alſo in the
debilitie, weakeneſſe, and coldneſſe of the Liuer or ſtomach,
proceeding from long and lingring diſeaſes. The like tincture
it receiueth now and then in the extreame pinching Collicke
paſſion, when as ſome tough and clammie humours poſſeſſing
the guts, do hinder the paſſage of the faecall excrements.</p>
               <p>A Gentleman of account <hi>(ſaith he)</hi> voyded vrine of a very high
red colour,<note place="margin">Hiſtorie.</note> howbeit free from any feauer: being at the ſame time
much tormented with the Collicke, accompanied with a retention of
the faecall excrements. After the iniection of an anodine, or mitigating
gliſter, the paine was much eaſed, and withall the vrine became of a
remiſſe and light colour, ſuch as it was wont to be in his former
health. After a ſhort ſpace his vrine reaſſumed againe its former high
colour, vntill ſuch time as by frequent reiteration of gliſters, the vrine
at length perſiſted in that laudable ſtate and condition once before be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun,
the bodie alſo without any artificiall meanes performed its ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie
functions.</p>
               <p>A Citizen of good account,<note place="margin">Another.</note> about fiftie yeares of age, being freed
from a Quartane ague,<note place="margin">Idem Ibidem.</note> which had held him for the ſpace of foure or
fiue moneths, fell into that kind of laske which we commonly call <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enteria.</hi>
His excretions by ſtoole were very liquid and crude, and
no remainder of the heate of the Ague to be diſcerned. His vrines alſo
were of as high a red colour, as is at any time to be ſeene in the moſt
violent burning feauers, or inflammations of the inward parts. But
yet did I not build vpon any ſo rotten a foundation, but hauing a more
watchfull eye on other matters, I thought it neceſſarie in the firſt
place to haue a care of the ſtomach, and in the next place of the Liuer,
both being by meanes of the former Quarterne ague, not a little
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:4002:43"/>
weakened. For this end and purpoſe I preſcribed his diet in qualitie
hote and drie, allowing him for his drinke the beſt and ſtrongeſt wines,
ſuch as are Sacke and Canarie. Phyſicall meanes were <hi>Diagalanga,
Diatrion-pipereon,</hi> and ſuch like. By continuance of which meanes,
this much at length was obtained, that the ſaecall excrements did
now ſhew forth good concoctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, the vrines alſo as in his former perfect
health. After all the premiſſes the aforementioned patient aſſuring
himſelfe of perfect health, did ſecretly fall againe to the too liberall
drinking of beere. Immediatly after this diſorder, the colour of his
vrine was againe altred into an high deepe red, vndoubtedly declaring
vnto vs, that ſometimes the vrines receiue an high and deepe colour,
by reaſon of the cruditie and coldneſſe of the ſtomach.<note place="margin">Vrine ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times red by reaſon of the cruditie of the ſtomach.</note> After that time
therefore he refrained againe from beere, vpon the which his vrine
returned to its former laudable condition, neither did he after that
vſe any beere, vntill ſuch time as he had perfectly recouered his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
health againe.</p>
               <p>Theſe things haue I related, becauſe of the ignorance and
error of many, who are perſwaded, that the vrine cannot be
died with ſo high a colour, any other way then by heate, who
whenſoeuer they ſee ſuch an vrine brought to them, the patient
being tormented with the Collicke, they very vnaduiſedly and
raſhly haue recourſe to the cure of a feauer, neglecting the cure
of the Collicke, which by theſe meanes they are ſo farre from
curing, that they do rather much increaſe the paine of the ſame.

and weakneſſe of the Liuer: for he cannot conceiue
how that bloud can come from any other part of the bodie
without ſome indiſpoſition of the kidneys. But yet (by the
leaue of ſo learned a man) many things there be which make
againſt this aſſertion. For oftentimes by experience we ſee ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
plethoricke young men, feeding on abundance of daintie
diſhes, &amp; liuing in eaſe and idleneſſe, to piſſe bloud by meanes
of a relaxation of ſome veine,<note place="margin">Per <gap reason="foreign">

And who can here I pray thee, accuſe the kidneyes, there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

               <p>And thus may the deceit and vncertaine iudgement had by

be conceiued, for the which cauſe I will here ſurceaſſe from in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting
any more vpon them: but now, becauſe mention hath
bene made of ſome ſmall quantity of bloud iſſuing foorth with
the vrines, we will ſay ſomething of the abundant piſſing
of bloud, illuſtrating it by ſome authorities, as heretofore we
haue done.</p>
               <p>Now as theſe vrines of an high and intenſe red colour,<note place="margin">Of piſſing of bloud.</note> do

pipes and paſſages, cauſe no ſmall amazement to the eyes of
the ignorant, and ſometimes of the more iudicious beholder
of it. And yet doth not this alwayes portend ſo infallible and
vndoubted danger, as by many is deemed. Sometimes indeed
the danger is ſo great, that not onely a meane and ordinarie
vnderſtanding, but a more refined iudgement, may iuſtly feare
the future danger: as in the rupture of ſome great veine neare
the Liuer, or the kidneyes, after which doth an vlcer often en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue,
and after a long torturing and tormenting paine, Death
moſt commonly maketh an end of their ſo miſerable and pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
life. Sometimes againe this fluxe prooueth very ſafe and
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:4002:44"/>
ſecure, as in criticall and periodicall excretions. But heare, I
pray thee,<note place="margin">Aretaeus Cappa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox. lib. 4. cap. 3. diuturn. morb.</note> an ancient Author deliuer his opinion concerning
this point.</p>
               <p>Some men there are, who by certaine turnes, and at certaine
times do piſſe bloud abundantly, being a diſeaſe not vnlike to
the haemorrhoides or piles. The ſtate and conſtitution of their
bodie alſo is not vnlike: for they are very pale, dull, ſluggiſh,
and lumpiſh: they loath their food, and after this excretion of
bloud, there followeth a certaine reſolution and faintneſſe of
their ioynts, their head notwithſtanding becometh much
lighter and better. But if at this accuſtomed and wonted pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod
of time, there ſhall happen a ſuppreſſion or ſtoppage of
the aforeſaid fluxe, they are preſently ſurpriſed with a great
head-ach, their eye-ſight waxing dim, ſeconded with a giddi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
and ſwimming in the head. Vpon which occaſion it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
to paſſe, that many of them fall into the falling ſickneſſe:
ſome of them againe being puffed vp and ſwollen, with their
eye-ſight ſomewhat darkened, do reſemble <hi>Hydropicke</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons:
others are oppreſſed with melancholicke diſeaſes, and
ſome againe with Paralyticke paſſions. All theſe inconueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
do follow vpon the ſuppreſſion of any former fluxe of
bloud.</p>
               <p>Sometimes piſſing of bloud <hi>(ſaith</hi> Hollerius) is criticall,<note place="margin">Holler. Schol. ad cap. 52. lib. 1. de morb.</note> and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth

Archembault the Counſeller, by turnes did ſometimes caſt
vp by the mouth, and ſometimes did voyd it downewards by ſtoole,

the Spring do piſſe bloud; and this I find written by Archigenes, that
ſome do by certaine turnes voyd great ſtore of bloud by the yard, being
firſt collected in and about the kidneyes, and that they find themſelues
much eaſed thereby.</p>
               <p>I am very familiarly acquainted with one Donatus Arrigonius,<note place="margin">Hiſtorie.</note> a

vpon his iourney homewards to Mantua, and faſt aſleepe in his Inne,
being accompanied with another friend, who lay in the ſame bed with

great ſtore of blackiſh bloud; in ſo much that his companion being all

               <p>A certaine yong man,<note place="margin">Another.</note> after the eating of great ſtore of garlicke,
piſſed afterwards great abundance of bloud; and after a little while
ſignes of an impoſtume in the kidneyes might be obſerued: to wit, ſome
matter iſſuing forth from the ſame: from whence I did collect, that the
ſharpneſſe of the humour had cauſed an excoriation in theſe parts, by

the paine whereof made him caſt forth ſuch pitifull cries and
complaints, that his ſorrowfull neighbours did much commiſerate his
diſtreſſed eſtate. His wife no leſſe perplexed then amazed, at this ſo
ſudden and vnexpected accident, at his deſire ſent to intreat my ayde
and counſell in this his ſo great extremitie. Some halfe an houre or
leſſe after the adminiſtration of a diureticke drinke inwardly, and a
Cataplaſme outwardly applyed to his ſhare, he filled almoſt a chamber
pot with bloud, ſome ſmall quantitie of vrine being mingled with the
ſame: whereupon followed immediatly caſe and alleuiation of all his
former annoyance. The ſame night, about an houre after, he ſent me
a little wooden diſh almoſt halfe full of gobbets of congealed and clot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
bloud, reſembling the ſubſtance of the Liuerie ſelfe. The next
morning againe he ſent me an vrinall almoſt full of bloud voyded at
the ſame place, no vrine to the iudgement of the eye at the firſt to be

beſides other fit and conuenient remedies, as well in diet as otherwiſe;

be collected within the veines of an healthfull man. But howſoeuer
in a laudable and healthfull conſtitution of body, it doth not ſo much
abound in the veines as do the other humours, yet is it on the other
ſide moſt certaine, that this humour doth abound in that temperature
of body which is cold and drie, ſince that from thence the cold and dry
conſtitution taketh its name. And this did I my ſelfe obſerue in a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine

the coldeſt and drieſt conſtitution of body that euer I did yet know,
who for the ſpace of ſixe whole yeares, during his abode here with vs,

               <p>That this blacke vrine may prooue a criticall excretion,<note place="margin">Blacke vrines critical in diuers diſeaſes.</note> not

&amp;c. But I produce my authorities. We muſt not vnadui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedly
and without any limitation, iump with the iudgement of
<hi>Galen</hi> in condemning of blacke vrines. For howſoeuer he did
neuer perhaps ſee any ſaued after the voyding of ſuch an vrine,
yet haue diuerſe other of no ſmall note and fame ſince his time
ſeene and obſerued the ſame: for the which cauſe it ought not
ſo much to be condemned; nay not if thou wouldeſt euen tye
thine aſſertion to acute diſeaſes: yea though thou ſhouldeſt yet
further ſuppoſe many other bad and dangerous ſignes to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre
with the ſame. For beſides <hi>Rhaſes, Auicenna,</hi> and <hi>Actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arius,
Hippocrates</hi> himſelfe, in his epidemicall hiſtories, did ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue,
that ſome with ſuch vrines did recouer. The vrine there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
may be often of that colour without any imminent dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
to the patient, and that vpon the taking of any meate,
drinke, or medicine, of a blacke colour, &amp; perhaps indued with
a <hi>diureticall</hi> qualitie; concerning which there is a prettie ſtorie
in <hi>Actuarius.</hi> It proueth alſo often a criticall excretion in Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tane
agues, in diſeaſes of the <hi>ſpleene,</hi> as alſo in the ſuppreſſion of
womens menſtruous fluxes, and of the Hemorthoides or piles
in both ſexes. And yet moreouer according to the minde of
<hi>Auicenna,</hi> it cureth ſometimes feauers of long continuance,
whether they take their denomination from the day or from
the night.<note place="margin">Nocturnae <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> diurnae febre.</note> And yet further, in ſome infirmities of the kidneyes,
or yet a ſtone congealed in the bladder, the vrine ſometimes
preſenteth it ſelfe in the foreſaid habit and colour. And finally,
it doth ſometimes preſage the happie iſſue and euent of feauers
by bleeding at the noſe or ſweating. Since therefore ſometimes
it is a foretunner of extreme danger, to wit, when it doth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
from extreme hear or cold, and ſometimes againe ſecure
and without any danger at all, <hi>Rhaſes</hi> and <hi>Auicenna</hi> do thus ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord
them. If the foreſaid vrine be voyded in a great quantitie
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:4002:47"/>
and thinne, ſucceeding a cleare and wateriſh vrine, as alſo if
eaſe and alleuiation do follow vpon the voyding thereof, it
doth preſage nothing but good: and on the contrarie, without
the foreſaid circumſtances, a blacke vrine is very dangerous;
and in the ſtoppage of womens monethly diſeaſe, it is an vſuall
and accuſtomed, howbeit not a perpetuall and certaine ſigne.
But now I will inſtance in ſome hiſtories the proofe of theſe
criticall euacuations.</p>
               <p>I am very familiarly acquainted with a Church man,<note place="margin">Another.</note> who ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily
three or foure times a yeare complaineth of the ſwelling of his
ſpleene to an exceſſiue bigneſſe,<note place="margin">Anton. Valet ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercit. 40 ad Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler. de morb. in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern.</note> especially towards the Spring and Fall:
and vpon the approaching of the foreſaid diſeaſe, then doth he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine
of great griefe and paine in his ſides, his bodie becomming all
ouer of a leaden colour, and in this caſe daily waxing worſe and worſe,
vntill at length by voyding abundance of vrine blacke like vnto inke,
and that during the ſpace of ſixe or ſeuen dayes, the foreſaid ſwelling,
as alſo his great paine vaniſhing quite away, he recouered againe his
wonted and accuſtomed health. It is now twelue, if not fifteene yeares
ſince he was firſt acquainted with this criticall excretion by vrine, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
before that time bene troubled with the piles or hemorrhoides,
which notwithſtanding did yeeld but little matter.</p>
               <p>I haue of mine owne experience obſerued (ſaith the learned Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentius)
ſuch as haue bene troubled with the Spleene,<note place="margin">Another.</note> by meanes of a
plentifull euacuation by blacke vrine to haue bene cured.<note place="margin">Andr. Laurent. anat. lib. 1. quaeſt. 38.</note> Now it is
alſo to be obſerued, that ſuch vrines were blacke, not by generation,
by reaſon that ſuch vrines in Hippocrates his Prognoſt. Praedict. and
Aphoriſm, are alwayes deadly. For ſuch vrines do ſhew forth and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare,
either an extraordinarie great parching heate, or elſe a totall
extinction or ouerthrowing of naturall heate. But theſe vrines were
blacke by permixtion of a melancholicke humor, the which the Spleene
did ſend forth through the kidneyes into the bladder.</p>
               <p>Howbeit blacke vrines be by Hippocrates condemned as deadly
(ſaith <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>aleriola) or at leaſt very dangerous,<note place="margin">Franciſe. Valer. comm. ad libr. Gal. le constit. art. med. pag. 355</note> especially in acute diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes;
yet doth experience teach vs, that this manner of vrine may
proue criticall in ſome diſeaſes; as namely, in inflammations, or inue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate
obſtructions of the Spleene: as I did my ſelfe obſerue in a yong
youth called Iohn Ruffus,<note place="margin">Another.</note> ſonne to our Apothecary Anthonie Ruffus,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:4002:47"/>
who being once (as was ſuppoſed) readie to yeeld vp the ghoſt, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon

and that by meanes of thicke blacke vrine, together with ſuch
fit and proper remedies as are appropriated to the Spleene, exhibited
and applyed both outwardly and inwardly. Syluius hath ſeene diuers
who haue had euery yeare ſuch fluxes of vrine, and that without any
griefe or moleſtation whatſoeuer.</p>
               <p>But I will inſtance in a Tertian ague, ſuch vrines being more
ſeldome obſerued in this diſeaſe then in Quartanes and the like:
in the which my ſelfe being the patient, I cannot much be mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken.</p>
               <p>After I had continued about the ſpace of two yeares in France,<note place="margin">Another.</note> and
liuing at that inſtant in the towne of Fontenay le compte,<note place="margin">Of a baſtard Tertian in my ſelfe.</note> in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince
of Poictou, about the latter end of Iuly, I was ſurpriſed with a
baſtard Tertian ague, which thus continuing for the ſpace of three
weekes, yet without any violent accidents, I did at the first contemne.
After the foreſaid pace, the enemie aſſaulting me more fiercely then
at firſt, and that by redoubling of the former fits, being now of a ſingle
Tertian become a double, I armed my ſelfe with ſuch weapons as were
fit to encounter with ſo furious an aduerſarie. After the vſe of diuers
fit and proper remedies for the extirpation of the foreſaid infirmitie, I
voyded for the ſpace of three or foure dayes together great ſtore of
thicke blackiſh vrine like vnto inke, at the first ſight whereof (ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
read ſomething before in Hippocrates, concerning the danger of
ſuch vrines) I was ſomething afraid; but after more mature delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
I reſted better ſatisfied. I remember I had for certaine dayes
together drunke of an infuſion wherein was ſome quantitie of Sene
leaues, which as it ſeemeth by the attraction of the humour of that
colour did dye the vrine therewith. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto this criticall excretion was
ſhortly after added another: to wit, a violent laske, not without the
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:4002:48"/>
mixture of ſome bloud, which lasted at leaſt for the ſpace of a full
forthnight, and which did at length waſt away the mateer of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe
before the approaching of Winter; howbeit the imbecillitie of my
bodie was ſuch that I recouered not my full former ſtrength againe
vntill the Spring following.</p>
               <p>I gaue vpon a time to a patient of mine (ſaith <hi>Crato)</hi> much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled

with an vlcer-like matter all ouer his head and necke, and for
diuerſe dayes did runne great ſtore of this putrid matter from the
foreſaid ſores. But after a moneths ſpace, this child voyded abundance
of thicke blacke vrine for the ſpace of three dayes together, not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ſome acrimonie and ſharpneſſe, accompanied with a paine in his

recouer; neither would I ſuffer any thing to be applyed to his head
for curing of his ſcabs, which did very ſhortly heale of it ſelfe. Now
this vrine proued to be in this child criticall for the remouall of this
infirmitie.</p>
               <p>It may then plainly appeare, how little truſt we are to repoſe
in theſe vrines more then any other, either in ſickneſſe or in
health; and how eaſily the Phyſitian may be deceiued, who ſhall
giue too much credit thereunto. And who can tell by the ſight
of ſuch a blacke vrine onely, whether it be criticall as we ſay, or
ſymptomaticall, denouncing danger in an acute diſeaſe? This
the other circumſtances, eſpecially the ſight of the patient,

thicke withall, it ſignifieth that blacke choller, proceeding firſt
from yellow choller very aduſt, doth colour the vrine: or elſe
ſo great cold of the inward parts, that they are almoſt quite
mortified. It ſignifieth moreouer, extraodinarie exerciſe of the
bodie by running. In ſuch as do recouer out of any diſeaſe, it is
a ſigne of a laudable criſe, eſpecially if it come in any great
quantitie: for by this meanes the a duſt parts are voyded foorth.
In old men, if ſuch an vrine perſiſt long, it argueth that the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
conſtitution of the bladder is altered and changed by bad
and corrupt humours. In ſuch as are ſubiect to the ſtone, it is a
ſigne of the approaching of the Strangurie. The ſame vrine is
alſo ſometimes obſerued to be thinne, then ſignifying the mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of melancholy, which doth but a little colour the vrine.
And ſometimes alſo it ſignifieth blowes and ſtripes, howbeit
not in any violent or exceſſiue manner, and in ſuch a caſe it is a
laudable and good ſigne.</p>
               <p>As concerning greene vrines,<note place="margin">Of greene v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rines.</note> of them our Phyſitians com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
make two ſorts: one properly ſo called, and the other
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:4002:49"/>
called greene oylie vrines. As for the firſt, it ſignifieth accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to our writers, abundance of choler aduſt, and of a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligne
qualitie, and almoſt readie to be turned into blacke, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
daily more and more parched and burnt vp. And com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
in the beſt ſignification it ſignifieth aduſtion of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours,
long continuance and perſeuerance of the ſame. And
ſometimes cold in extreameſt degree, as was ſaid before of
blacke, and then is mortall: eſpecially if leaden colour and
blacke follow ſucceſſiuely at diuers times, pulſe feeble, with
thirſt or ſhort breath. Sometimes againe a Quotidian ague and
yellow laundiſe, eſpecially with an ague. And howbeit theſe
vrines often proue dangerous, yet is not the caſe alwayes alike:
for ſometimes this colour may be alſo ſeene in found &amp; health<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
bodies.<note place="margin">3. de rat. vict. acut.</note> 
                  <hi>Galen</hi> doth willingly confeſſe the ſame. <hi>Cholericke
people</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>which faſt long, do oftentimes make greene and fie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
coloured vrines.</hi> And that feeding vpon certaine kinds of
foode, may produce ſuch an vrine, this enſuing hiſtorie may
eaſily declare.</p>
               <p>There was a certaine Phyſitian,<note place="margin">Hiſtorie.</note> who hauing fed on ſome nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of that colour,<note place="margin">Guil. Adolph. Scribon. de in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect. vrin. prope finem.</note> did afterwards voyd an vrine of the ſame colour,
which he ſent to another Phyſitian, to fiſh out his opinion concerning
the ſame. This other Phyſitian gaue out his verdict concerning the
great danger this vrine did threaten the owner. But the other ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
him backe word againe, that vpon the feeding on ſuch and ſuch
food it was no vncouth thing for him to voyd ſuch an vrine: and
withall aduiſed him not to pronounce his opinion ſo peremptorily vpon
the colour of the vrine onely.</p>
               <p>The other ſort of greene vrines is a light popiniay greene,<note place="margin">Of popiniay greene, oylie vrine.</note>
called alſo an oylie vrine: that is, ſuch whoſe ſubſtance is clam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie
and thicke, as oyle or fat molten. It commonly ſignifieth
colliquation, and waſting of the fat within man or woman, as
proceeding from exceſſiue heate. And yet ſuch vrines, if blacke
vrines went before, ſignifieth health at hand. If it come ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly
and in a ſhort time, it argueth the colliquation or wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting
of the kidneyes only. The higher this colour is, the worſe
they commonly hold it. But I will dwell no longer vpon this
colour, ſince the vncertaintie thereof may be collected by that
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:4002:49"/>
which hath bene ſaid alreadie.</p>
               <p>As for aſh-coloured or leaden coloured vrines,<note place="margin">Of aſh-colou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, or leaden coloured vrines.</note> they haue not
alwayes one and the ſame ſignification more then the former.
If an vrine of this colour be thicke, and greene coloured vrine
went before, it ſignifieth extreame heate an <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>urning: if pale
coloured vrine went before, it doth portend extre a me cold and
mortification. This kind of vrine may alſo proceed from the
affluxe of melancholicke humours, or elſe by reaſon of great
blowes or ſtripes: and then it may prooue a good ſigne, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſiue
power expelling ſuch reſidence towards the bottome.
In feauers an vrine of this colour without any ſetling or reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
is a ſigne of death. But in a burning feauer it doth por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
a Strangurie. The ſame cauſes which did produce blew
vrines, do alſo bring foorth this colour, but that in this all
things are more violent. Sometimes ſuch an vrine is a ſigne of
the blacke Iaundiſe proceeding from melancholy. But then it
portends health, eſpecially if it be voyded in any great quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titie
and thicke in ſubſtance, by reaſon of the euacuation of
ſuch thicke humours. It is then apparent that theſe colours
ſignifie not alwayes one certaine thing, but ſometimes quite
contrary. For the which cauſe it is no maruell if a Phyſitian
who ſhould ſettle his iudgement ſolely thereupon, might eaſily
be deceiued.</p>

had need to conſider many things before we proceed to deliuer

And howſoeuer <hi>Hippocrates</hi> pronounceth this to be a moſt
dangerous vrine; yet haue I my ſelfe often obſerued the ſame
without any danger to the party, as I doubt not but ſo haue ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
moe beſides my ſelfe.</p>
               <p>About ſome eight or nine yeares ago,<note place="margin">Hiſtorie.</note> there came to me a yeoman
of Northamptonſhire, bringing with him his vrine which well nigh
filled the vrinall, being as cleare as any cryſtall, without any contents
at all, except ſome few motes, ſuch as they ſay are found in the vrines
of women with child. And becauſe I did ſee ſo great ods betwixt his
complexion and his vrine (he bring indifferent well coloured in regard
of the vrine, howbeit neare ſiftie yeares of age) not ſuspecting this
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:4002:50"/>
vrine to be his owne, began to enquire ſome circumſtances concerning
the ſame, as namely the time of continuance. At length he freely and
of his owne accord confeſſed, that the vrine was his owne, and that
aboue the ſpace of ſixe yeares by-paſt his vrine had not altered nor
changed from that I did new ſee it. He added moreouer, that he felt
neither griefe nor trouble in his bodie, as being able to go about his
ordinarie employments and workes of his calling; that he was now and
then troubled with ſome wind in his ſtomach, and that he himſelfe
wondered not a little at the long continuance of his vrine after this
manner. I gaue him directions againſt obſtructions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and crudities,
with ſomethings for the ſtrengthening of his ſtomach, and neuer ſince
heard any more newes of him.</p>
               <p>The like vrine haue I often obſerued in many other caſes, and
will inſtance but in one: to wit, an <hi>hyſtoricall paſſion,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
called the mother.</p>
               <p>Some ten yeares ago I had in cure a young maid,<note place="margin">Another.</note> much moleſted
with that diſeaſe which is commonly called the Mother. For foure
dayes together, from twelue of the clocke at noone till night, her fits
were ſo violent and tedious, and the intermiſſions ſo ſhort, that both
her father and other friends tooke (as they thought<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>) their iuſt leaue
of her. In her time of intermiſſion, or rather remiſſion, when ſhe was
moſt ſenſible of her ſelfe, ſhe voyded almoſt a chamber pot full at a time
of thinne cleare vrine, like vnto ſpring-water, without any manner of
contents diſcernable to the ſharpeſt eye-ſight, and this commonly foure
or fiue times in an afternoone, and that during the dayes of the foure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid
fits. But being afterwards freed from this infirmitie, ſhe was
likewiſe freed from the aforementioned accident. Neither did I euer
ſince that time know her trouble with this diſeaſe, ſaue once ſince ſhe
was married, and yet was nothing in regard of the former ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremitie.</p>
               <p>If any <hi>Argus</hi> had bene there with his hundreth eyes, or yet
the ſharpe ſighted <hi>Lynceus</hi> himſelfe, where ſuch vrines had bene
brought in two ſeuerall vrinals (I meane the mans laſt mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,

difference betwixt theſe two vrines: much leſſe then the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
Empiricke, the peticoate or woman-phyſitian, or the cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningeſt
piſſe-prophet among them all: and if thou wilt, put in
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:4002:51"/>
maſter Parſon-practiſer to make better weight. And if any had
brought ſuch an vrine, ſo often, in ſo great quantity, to any Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitian,
was there any reaſon why he ſhould not rather haue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectured
a <hi>Diabete,</hi> or <hi>piſſing euill,</hi> then any other infirmitie?
And this I thinke may ſuffice to prooue the vncertaintie of
iudgement by thinne white vrines: now ſomething of thicke
white vrines.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Of thicke white vrines.</note> in the late alledged place, doth include very
thicke vrines, of whatſoeuer colour they be, within the ſame de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
of danger. And <hi>Galen</hi> himſelfe ſeemeth to ſecond this o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion,
auerring that the thicker an vrine is, the more danger
hath he moſt commonly obſerued in the ſame. <hi>Rondeletius</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth,
that white vrines which are not tranſparent, but thicke
almoſt like vnto milke, do ſignifie abundance of phlegme, and
ſecondarily wormes, the falling-ſickneſſe, head-ach, palſie,
conuulſions, great coldneſſe of the naturall parts: and finally,
all manner of diſeaſes proceeding from phlegme. If ſuch an v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine
then were offered to thy view and conſideration, good
maſter vrine-monger, for which of theſe diſeaſes wouldeſt thou
giue out ſentence? There being many moe phlegmaticke diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes
beſides the laſt rehearſed; and many of them proceeding
from other cauſes, muſt by conſequent be accompanied with
other vrines: yea and in the ſame cauſe the vrine may by diuers
meanes not be the ſame. And theſe thicke vrines ſometimes ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied
with a copious reſidence, and ſometimes againe
without the ſame. I will now proceed to ſome inſtances of
both, where it ſhall appeare that ſometimes ſome ſuch vrines
are not ſo dangerous as they are deemed.</p>

dwelling in the South ſuburbe of Northampton, commonly called

elſe, as one would haue iudged by the eye, but thicke curdled
milke, which did very neare fill the vrinall, onely on the top of it did
ſwim a little liquor like vnto white poſſet drinke, being not halfe an
inch thicke aboue the foreſaid contents. And howbeit I did twice or
thrice ſee her vrine afterwards, yet could I neuer againe ſee theſe
curdled contents, it being onely like the aforeſaid white poſſet drinke,
howbeit ſhe had ſometimes before voyded ſuch an vrine, as I was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed.
She died about two moneths after: and as it ſeemeth, of a
conſumption and waſting of the kidneyes and other vrinary paſſages,
as by ſome ſignes did appeare. And what if the ſpermaticall parts did
participate with the former? The woman had lyen long languiſhing,
neither was I euer called to ſee her, and for any thing I know, had
few or no meanes adminiſtred vnto her, being but of poore and meane

had for a long time voyded great ſtore of ſuch tough phlegmaticke

ſome vrine was to be ſeene of a darke colour, not vnlike to transparent
horne. His paine was exceeding great, prouoking him almoſt euery
minute of an houre to this vntimely excretion of his vrine. The coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels
of the beſt Phyſitians were not wanting, ſome being of opinion it
was a ſtone in the bladder, others iudging otherwiſe. My opinion
being demanded, I told him I was not of their opinion, who held that
there was a ſtone in the bladder, moued hereunto by ſome probable
coniectures. But ſeeing him much macerated and weakened by much
Phyſicke, exhibited both by the learned Phyſitian and by the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
Empiricke alſo, my aduice was, that he ſhould abſtaine from all
manner of laxatiue medicines, except it were now and then ſome
gentle gliſter or lenitiue to procure the benefit of nature. I appointed
him alſo fit and conuenient diet: and all his Phyſicke was nothing ſaue
ſome certaine Emulſions, as alſo ſome Iuleps compoſed of ſome ſyrupes

circles or garlands are no ſuch round rings or circles as haue

which ſwimme in the liquor of the ſame, and for the ſame rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,

Of the former of the two do our Phyſitians moſt commonly

theſe circles or garlands aright, a ſharpe and very quicke ſight
is very requiſite. Moreouer, may not thine owne ſight, together
with the qualitie or quantitie of the light, the diuers manners
of ſituation of the vrinall, one or all of theſe, eaſily alter the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
of this thy circle, making it appeare ſometimes of one,
ſometimes of another colour? Beſides, theſe circles or garlands
are ſuppoſed to be ſeene in ſuch vrines onely as are not of one

<hi>Another learned author lately mentioned,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Idem Reganus de prouid. ex v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinis lib. 3. cap. 8.</note> 
                  <hi>would alſo willingly
haue them baniſhed out of all the Hippocraticall common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth,
in theſe words following:</hi> But perhaps in vaine do I la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
to roote out this ſo inueterate and inbred opinion (meaning con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
froth, ſpume and bubbles) out of the minds of our ordinarie
Phyſitians. The like may I ſay concerning the crownes or garlands in
vrines, the opinion whereof hath now almoſt ſo deeply poſſeſſed euery
mans mind. It is moſt certaine that Actuarius himſelfe neuer did
prognoſticate any ſuch thing by this circle or line compaſſing round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the ouermoſt part of the vrine, hauing onely brought it in, to the
end he might prognoſticate by the bubbles when as they do appeare in
it. And who is ſo blind, that doth not ſee how ridiculous a thing it is
to prognoſticate by a certaine circle or roundring, which may be as
well obſerued in any other round veſſell filled with any liquor,<note place="margin">Idem lib. 2. de cauſ. vrin. cap. 9.</note> as in an
vrinall? As concerning that crowne or garland which is the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficies
or ouermoſt part of the vrine, which Actuarius ſeemeth to haue
borrowed from <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> we haue by the authorities of <hi>Galen,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie
reiected. Wherefore in my opinion theſe crownes and garlands
ſhall be baniſhed farre from vrines. <hi>So farre our author. It is not
alſo vnlikely, that if they had bene of ſuch vſe and neceſſitie, but</hi>
Hirpocrates <hi>or</hi> Galen <hi>would haue mentioned them; together
with their ſeuerall vſes in Phyſicke, they both being ſo curious
in ſearching out the ſeuerall ſignifications of this ſigne. If any
will yet obiect, that our moderne Phyſitians haue added many
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:4002:54"/>
things to former inuentions; I could reply, it is true indeed, and
might well come to paſſe in ſuch things as neuer did preſent
themſelues to their ſenſes, or elſe in ſuch things whereof they
had no experimentall knowledge: but I ſuppoſe they were as
eagle eyed in</hi> Aſia <hi>and other parts, and could ſee as farre into a
milſtone as any of our late</hi> Europaean <hi>Phyſitians. And this ſhall
now ſuffice concerning</hi> circles <hi>or</hi> garlands, <hi>we now proceed to
the reſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bubbles,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Of bubbles, ſpume or froth.</note> 
                  <hi>ſpume, or froth,</hi> are all accounted to proceed from one
and the ſame cauſe, differing in ſome circumſtances onely. Now
if we ſhall narrowly obſerue and marke what can be ſaid of
them, we ſhall find no leſſe vncertaintie in the predictions by
them,<note place="margin">Idem lib. 2. de cauſ. vrin. cap. 9.</note> then in the former. <hi>Actuarius</hi> (ſaith our aboue named au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor)
maketh mention of many things concerning this matter
which neither <hi>Galen</hi> nor <hi>Hippocrates</hi> haue obſerued, and that in
my opinion (ſaith he) becauſe they were not worth the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing.
And againe a little after: <hi>Such things as</hi> Actuarius <hi>hath ſet
downe concerning the ſpumes and bubbles, are nothing to be regarded.
For who ſeeth not, that as well the ſpume as the bubbles ſtay longer in
the crowne or garland of the vrine, and in the middle part of the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficies
or ouermoſt part they are ſooner diſſolued. For the caſe is not
here alike as in the garland, where the ſolid body of the vrinall is an
occaſion that they ſticke longer and more firmely to the ſame. And
this not in vrine onely, but in any other liquor in like manner may
eaſily be obſerued, to wit, that ſuch froth and bubbles do longer per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt
in the circle ioyning to the veſſell then in the rest of the ouermoſt
part of the ſame, &amp;c.</hi> This foundation then being rotten, the
reſt of the building muſt needs fall to the ground. They tell vs
in the firſt place that bubbles which ſtand round about ouer the
garland onely, and continue without parting, if they be of the
ſame colour the vrine is of, they declare that there is great paine
in all the parts of the head. But if they occupie onely the one
halfe of the garland, then is that paine in one halfe of the head.
But I aſſure thee, ſuch bubbles may be ſeene, and thou not able
to diſcerne whether the wind be in the head or taile. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
thou mayeſt ſometimes finde a good fellow who could
quickly fill a baggepipe with his bum, and yet in his vrine ſee
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:4002:54"/>
neither bubble nor any other ſuch babble.<note place="margin">See before in the beginning.</note> But concerning the
vncertaintie of theſe things, ſomething hath bene ſaid alreadie
in another place, whereas mention was made of the regions of
the vrine anſwering to the parts of mans body, which was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
moſt falſe. It is granted, that ſometimes theſe bubbles do
not appeare at the firſt in the beginning of the diſeaſe, howbeit
after a while they begin to ſhew themſelues: and then is it an
argument that nature waxeth ſtrong to concoct and ouercome
the bad humours. In feauers therefore ſuch do ſignifie the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining
or decaying of the ſame. But if they haue bene from the
beginning ſtill ſo continuing, then is the danger greater, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit
better with a thicke then with a thinne vrine. Now put the
caſe that in an vrine brought to thee from afarre thou mighteſt
diſcerne ſome ſuch bubble or froth, yet how ſhalt thou be able
to diſcerne whether any were in the vrine at the beginning of
the diſeaſe, or no? The meſſenger for the moſt part can tell
thee no more then the ground he goeth on: and it may be, that
neither the patient nor any about him are able to obſerue ſuch
nice curioſities, as often not obſeruing matters of greater mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
But put yet the caſe thou couldſt diſcerne ſome headach

but rather prognoſticating the long continuance of the diſeaſe.
Such frothie vrines with ſome bubbles are to be ſeene in feuers
proceeding from the abundance of crude or raw humours. And
not ſo onely, but in the infirmities of the kidneyes alſo; <hi>Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi>

               <p>Such vrines haue this fat ſwimming on the top,<note place="margin">Of fat ſwim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming on the top of vrines.</note> ſometimes

alſo ſignifie ſometimes a waſting of the whole bodie, if there be
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:4002:55"/>
a feauer ioyned with the ſame; or of the kidneyes onely, if with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
it.<note place="margin">Gal. Comm. 3. in lib. 3. epid.</note> This feauer is ſometimes very ſpeedy and ſwift in opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
waſting ſuddenly not the fat onely, but the ſolid ſubſtance
of the body alſo; called therefore by our Phyſitians, <hi>Febris col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquans;</hi>
and ſuch are often <hi>Peſtilentiall</hi> feauers. It is againe ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
an <hi>Hecticke,</hi> which endeth in a <hi>Maraſme,</hi> vnleſſe it be firſt
preuented. But how ſhall one be able by the bare ſight of the
vrine onely, to diſcerne all theſe ſeuerall circumſtances and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences?<note place="margin">De prouid. ex v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinis lib. 3. cap. 6.</note>
But this is yet worth the obſeruing (ſaith <hi>Roganus)</hi>
that when as theſe waſting or conſuming feauers haue wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nigh
waſted away the whole bodie, then are no more ſuch wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting
excretions, which he calleth <hi>ſyntectica excrementa,</hi> either
fat vrines or faecall excrements to be ſeene. For the fleſhie parts
being hardned and dried vp, that which melteth and waſteth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
falleth now no more into the guts or the paſſages of
the vrine,<note place="margin">Lib. 1. meth. med. cap. vlt.</note> but paſſeth away like a vapour. This <hi>Galen</hi> ſetteth
downe by a very prettie and pertinent compariſon, taken from
fleſh broyled on a gridiron. Now if any one ſhould conceiue
ſome better hope by reaſon that this fat matter did no more ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare,
ſhould he not miſſe the marke, the caſe being now farre
more dangerous then before?<note place="margin">Guil. Adolph. Scrib. de inſpect. vrinar. prope fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem.</note> The words of <hi>Scribonius</hi> make
not a little to cleare this point in hand. <hi>By theſe fat vrines (ſaith
he) ſome do teach vs that we may eaſily diſcerne and know all the
kinds of a feauer Hecticke, by reaſon it ſignifieth a waſting and mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of the parts of the bodie.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">3. de praeſagit. ex pulſ.</note> 
                  <hi>But whatſoeuer reaſon we render of the
ſame, Galen notwithſtanding in expreſſe words affirmeth; that the v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine
of ſuch as are ſurpriſed with a feauer Hecticke hath no certaine
ſignification. Experience alſo doth teach vs, that ſome being of a cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lericke
constitution of body, as alſo ſuch as haue eaten fat meates, or
haue fat kidneyes, vſe often to make fat vrines. What reaſon is there
then to pronounce either a feauer Hecticke, or yet any waſting or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption
thereby? This is not erronious onely, but full oftemeritie al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo.
The truth of this aſſertion may alſo in this more plainly appeare,
that many haue dyed of ſuch conſumption and waſting, who neuer, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
had any fat ſwimme on their vrines. Sometimes it hath
bene alſo obſerued, that the veſſell wherein the vrine hath bene car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed
to the Phyſitian, hath before contained either oyle or ſome other
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:4002:56"/>
fat matter, which hath by this meanes bene communicated to the v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine.
It is therefore the Phyſitians part diligently to enquire concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
all the circumſtances of the diſeaſe, and not by the inspection of
the vrine onely peremptorily to pronounce any thing.</hi> Thus farre our
author. Many of my friends and patients haue voyded vrines
with this fat like a ſpiders web floting on the top for diuerſe
yeares together, and yet were neuer ſubiect to any conſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
or waſting, either in the whole bodie or their kidneyes.
And how eaſily one may be deceiued in theſe fat vrines, may by
this which followeth appeare.</p>

procured, and want of food, which may alſo make the
vrine of an higher colour. The inflammation of any part of the
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:4002:56"/>
bodie, by drawing of the humours thither, may produce the
like effect. In lasks alſo or fluxes of the bellie, as the vrine ſhall
be the leſſer, ſo ſhall the contents be few or none at all. Some
certaine conſtitutions alſo gather no ſetlings in their vrines:
and ſuch as are in preſent health, and eate much, haue a more
copious reſidence, and in Winter it doth more abound then in
Sommer. Laborious and very painfull people may alſo haue lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
or no contents at all in their vrines. The time of the ſickneſſe
in which this cometh to paſſe, is alſo narrowly to be obſerued:
for in the beginning and increaſe of acute diſeaſes, then this
want of contents argueth great defect of naturall ſtrength and
vigour. In the declining of the diſeaſe it is not a meſſenger of
ſo bad newes, yea although it were in the vigour and ſtrength
of it. And moreouer that many diſeaſes are brought to a hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie
and expected iſſue without any contents at all, is no vncouth
thing. What certaintie then can be collected, either by the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
or yet by the abſence of the contents? Now howbeit
heretofore ſome contents on the top of the vrine haue bene
mentioned, yet are theſe laſt mentioned, moſt commonly and
conſtantly to be ſeene ordinarily in vrines; and therefore are
more properly called contents, and ſo to be vnderſtood by that
name. Now all theſe three, cloud, ſwimme, and grounds, haue
one and the ſame materiall cauſe, and their generation is alſo
alike, differing onely in place and ſituation, according to the
weight of the matter and the concoction of the diſeaſe. When
the diſeaſe is yet crude and not concocted, yet in ſome for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſſe
thereunto, then appeareth that which is commonly
called a cloud,<note place="margin">The cloud.</note> for the proportion and analogie it ſeemeth to
haue with the clouds of the aire. When the diſeaſe is yet in a
better forwardneſſe, then is to be ſeene in the vrine, that which
is commonly called the ſwim or ſublimation,<note place="margin">The ſwimme.</note> hanging as it
were betwixt the ouermoſt and neathermoſt region of the v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine.
But when nature hath now gotten the vpper hand of the
diſeaſe,<note place="margin">The ground.</note> then doth this which we call ground, ſettle to the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome
of the vrinall. My purpoſe is not here to enter into a large
diſcourſe concerning the engendring of this ſubſtance, and
farre leſſe yet the controuerſies about the ſame, which I leaue
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:4002:57"/>
to be diſcuſſed in the ſchooles, my intent here being onely to
diſcouer the vncertaintie of iudgement which theſe contents
do affoord vs. Now when thou ſeeſt the cloud, ſwim, or reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
what canſt thou pronounce but ſome generall and inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
verdict concerning the cruditie or concoction of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe?
but what this thy diſeaſe is, thy vrine will neuer reueale
vnto thee, nor any of the reſt of the ſignes and circumſtances
to be obſerued in diſeaſes. And howſoeuer the materiall cauſe
of all theſe three be one and the ſame, differing onely in cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances,
yet may ſometimes the one be without the other.

from them. It is generally agreed vpon among Phyſitians, that
great ſtore of yellow grounds argueth great ſtore of yellow
choler in the bodie; and the lighter coloured it be, it argueth
the leſſe, the higher coloured the greater exceſſe. Now beſides
that thou canſt not tell what particular diſeaſe proceeding

Ague, or ſome other diſeaſe: and againe, if an Ague, of what
ſort or kind, continuall or intermittent: ſo much leſſe art thou
able to tell the time of it, which notwithſtanding maketh not

at the firſt there be either ſmall quantitie of choler, or yet none

by changing from a white thin to a ſaffron coloured ground)
it is a ſigne and token that nature doth vnburden it ſelfe of this
heauie ballaſt of choler, and ſo conſequently that health is like
ſhortly to enſue. But if after a ſaffron colour it change to a
white, it is a bad ſigne, eſpecially without ſignes of concoction:
for the which cauſe it will be requiſite that thou obſerue the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall
alterations of the vrine, and then be well acquainted with
the ſtate and nature of the diſeaſe of the patient. The like may
be ſaid of red reſidence,<note place="margin">Red reſidence.</note> the which in the beginning of diſeaſes
doth not portend any good, and that by reaſon it argueth great

The bare inſpection of the vrine onely will neuer acquaint thee
with the particular. Sometimes both the afore-mentioned
contents are to be ſeene in one and the ſame vrine, which is
ſometimes deadly, and ſometimes againe proueth a fore-runner

                  </gap>uritie: I will inſtance in two examples of
mine owne experience, to make the truth of this appeare.</p>
               <p>About ſome three yeares ago,<note place="margin">Hiſtorie.</note> or a little aboue, a young Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
in the countrey, to mine owne knowledge, voyded ſuch an vrine
for a quarter of a yeare together, and by appearance had ſo continued
long before my ſight of the ſame: and yet notwithſtanding all the eua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuations
were vſed, it continued ſo more or leſſe vntill his dying day.
His diſeaſe was a Dropſie, and with the ſame was ioyned the yellow
Iaundiſe, which did outwardly ſhew it ſelfe to the view of the eye.
His Liuer hote, and the whole conſtitution of his bodie participating
of the ſame diſtemper.</p>
               <p>But in the yeare 1613.<note place="margin">Another.</note> a woman of Northampton of good ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
being with child, voyded an vrine with the like reſidence, and
that for as long a time at leaſt, and yet did their diſeaſes farre differ.
For beſides her being with a liue child (for vntill that time was not
my counſell craued) ſhe was for a many weekes together neuer free
from a Tertian, Quotidian, or both agues conioyned: the which were
accompanied with a continuall cough, proceeding from a thinne ſalt
rheume, with ſpitting of bloud, reaching and caſting, as alſo a great
laske, all which accidents, or the moſt of them, did not forſake her till
neare the time of her deliuerie. Phlebotomie for diuerſe conſiderations
I durſt not then attempt. Other euacuations, both vpwards and
downewards, came in greater abundance then was wiſhed. It was now
deepely imprinted, not in her owne onely, but in the conceits of her
neighbours and others alſo of good vnderſtanding, that (in regard of
her ſpitting of bloud) ſhe was now farre ſpent in an irrecouerable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption.
Vpon the relation of others I inclined to the ſame opinion.
But at my firſt ſight of her, together with the ſight of the bloud ſhe
ſpat vp I changed my opinion. And ſo, God adding his bleſſing to the
meanes ſhe vſed by my directions, ſhe brought foorth at the time ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed,
a liue manchild, which neuertheleſſe liued not aboue the ſpace
of a moneth. The mother two or three dayes after her deliuerie was
ſurpriſed with the Meaſels, and afterwards recouered her health a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:4002:58"/>
the which at this preſent day ſhe yet enioyeth.</p>
               <p>Here was no Dropſie at all, nor yet could I euer perceiue any
ſigne of a hote Liuer, and the matter of the Iaundiſe was voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
both by ſtoole and vrine. It may then plainly appeare, how
farre the diſeaſes may ſometimes differ, the reſidence being ſtill
alike in two ſeuerall bodies, ſexes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>As concerning bloudy reſidence,<note place="margin">Bloudie reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and the ſeuerall cauſes of the ſame.</note> as was before ſaid of
bloudy vrine, it may come either of abundance of bloud in
a plethoricall body, or elſe by weakneſſe of the retentiue
power, and of the Liuer; the which rightly to diſcerne, wee
muſt be acquainted with diuers other circumſtances, which the
vrine can neuer make knowen. It hath beene likewiſe already
related, that ſometimes great quantitie of bloud it ſelfe hath
beene voyded without any danger: and ſometimes againe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the voyding of a very ſmall quantitie thereof, death hath
not long deferred his approaches.</p>
               <p>In the yeere 1614.<note place="margin">Hiſtorie.</note> about the beginning of Ianuary, my counſell
was demanded for a Gentleman dwelling neare <hi>Northampton,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
fiftie yeares of age or vpwards. In his vrine at my firſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
at him, was to be ſeene great ſtore of yellowiſh contents, clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
to the bottome of the vrinall, wherewith were intermingled
ſome red ſtreakes of bloud. And howbeit I often earnestly intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
him to admit of Phlebotomie, as the onely remedy to preuent a
greater inconuenience, yet could I not preuaile, vntill ſuch time as
bloud now iſſuing out in great abundance, both vpwards and downe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
his ſtrength now decaying, and hairy irrecouerable occaſion
ouer paſt, with a too late repentance, he would willingly haue paied
a good fine for the renewing of the leaſe of his life, but all too late.</p>
               <p>As concerning white,<note place="margin">See ſomewhat in the colours heretofore.</note> blacke, leaden, or aſh-coloured; as

all the ſorts of wormes commonly recorded by our Phyſitians,

how many young childrens vrines haue they found any ſuch

                  <hi>In a certaine citizen at Paris, the baſilica or Liuer veine being o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened,

by the ſight of wormes in the vrine. There are yet ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
motes to be ſeene in the vrine, which according to our

the ſeuerall colours of the ſame, vpon the which I will not long
dwell, but yet ſay ſomething of the blacke, which may ſeeme
to threaten greateſt danger. Such duſt falling to the bottome,
either blacke or of a leaden colour, proceeding of melancholie,
is thought to ſignifie fluxe of the <hi>Emeraudes,</hi> preſent, or ſhortly

               <p>In the beginning of the yeare 1623. my counſell and perſonall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence

ſome clotted bloud, matter, knob or bunch, or any tumour, the

Eightly, by meanes of a Palſie or reſolution of the bladder. The
vncertaintie therefore of the vrine in diſeaſes of this nature and

ſome Empiricke or vnskilfull Phyſitian, his conceit will

clotted bloud I haue inſtanced alreadie.</p>
               <p>This last Spring a young Gentleman of Leiceſterſhire,<note place="margin">Mercat. Tome. 1. lib. 3. par. 3. claſſ. 3. quaeſt. 217.</note> of good
worth, trauailing towards London thorow this Towne of Northamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,<note place="margin">Hiſtorie.</note>
was ſuddenly ſurpriſed with a ſuppreſſion of vrine. Being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid
of a ſtone in his bladder (howbeit he had neuer heretofore
complained of this infirmity) yet tried he what the art of Surgerie
could doe, by meanes of a Catheter thruſt vp thorow his yard to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the necke of his bladder, together with ſome other meanes,
which notwithſtanding tooke no effect. The next morning, about
eight of the clocke, I was ſent for to the patient, whoſe belly began to
ſwell, and ſome fumes to aſcend into his head. By meanes of a gentle
opening inlep, together with a Cataplaſme applied to his ſhare, it
pleaſed God to accompliſh his deſires: howbeit a meſſenger had bene
already ſent away to bring with him an expert Surgeon to make in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion.
He voyded that day abundance of vrine of a laudable colour,
and anſwerable contents; ſo that none could find any fault in the ſame,
and the next day he went forward in his intended iourney towards
London.</p>
               <p>The paſſage of the vrine in this patient was ſomewhat nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,
as ſeemeth, and that by reaſon of ſome former infirmity;
and perhaps ſome wind gathered in the great gut might make
ſome compreſſion of the necke of the bladder. Now that ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion

               <p>This laſt yeere 1623.<note place="margin">Another.</note> Auguſt the 28. an Alderman of Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thampton,
a man of good account in this Corporation, neare fiftie
yeares of age, ſubiect of late yeares to a great paine in his head, and
ſometimes my patient: riding abroad in his corne-field, about ſome
three miles off this Towne, was ſuddenly ſurpriſed with a chilneſſe
in his legges, and ſhortly after complained of the like in his backe,
bones, and vpper parts of his body: vpon which occaſion he hyed him
home, and imagining it to be ſome cold, continued ill that night, and
the next day and night following. The Satterday after, and the
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:4002:63"/>
third day of his diſeaſe, by perſwaſion of ſome of his friends, his vrine
with a letter was carried to a Parſon practiſer, dwelling about a
dozen of miles hence, one of our chiefe Calculators of Natiuities in
all the countrey. The Parſon ſent backeword, it was a blind Ague,
and withall ſends him a vomit, and preſcribes Phlebotomie. The
Surgeon being ſent for, perceiues a Iaundiſe, and the patient com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaines
of ſome faintneſſe; vpon which occaſion he refuſes to let him
bloud, wiſhing his friends to acquaint the Parſon with theſe occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents.
The Parſon repeales his former ſentence, and commends
the Surgeon for being ſo ſparing. And indeed he dealt honeſtlier
then the Parſon: for he truſted none but his owne eyes, and ſo told
his mind freely to his friend: but the Parſon both ſaw with other
mens eyes, and heard with other mens eares; and building vpon this
ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ndy foundation, ſent his Oracle to the abſent, which he as eaſily
recalled againe vpon the firſt information, and ſends him another
Oracle written now in a peece of paper, and withall ſends him an
Electuary and Iulep for his laundiſe, and ſome directions for a
drinke. But let vs heare the laudable effects of this vomit. It
wrought vpwards effectually, and ſomething downewards: and while
the patient was able to take any ſuſtenance, it returned backe by the
ſame way it went in. And beſides, after the operation of this vomit,
the Iaundiſe appeared, a ſuppreſſion of vrine and ordure, together
with a troubleſome and tedious Hicket, which neither day nor night
forſooke our patient. To the former accidents was ſhortly added a
difficulty in ſwallowing, with an extreame ſoreneſſe in his mouth,
which like a Canker ſpread it ſelfe ouer all the parts of the ſame,
with an vlcer (as appeared) in the Almonds or parts adioyning,
which yeelded ſuch abundance of white corrupted matter at firſt,
and afterwards coloured, as I neuer did obſerue the like in euery re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect.
The Parſon being earneſtly intreated to affoord his patient his
preſence in this his ſo great extremity, no prayers would preuaile;
but ſent him backe word, that the Iaundiſe now appearing, he hoped
the worſt was paſt. The patient ſeeing himſelfe forſaken now in his
greateſt need, hauing learned by a too late repentance, that his Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
proued not ſo truſty a friend as he ſuppoſed; <hi>Cum nemini ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trudi

<pb n="111" facs="tcp:4002:63"/>
of his diſeaſe, he ſent for me, moſt earneſtly intreating me that I
would be pleaſed to affoord him my preſence with what ſpeed I could<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
I preferring Chriſtian charitie and loue of my old friend before any
late ingratitude, repaire preſently to his houſe, where I find him in
that caſe I haue alreadie related. Hauing acquainted his wife and
friends with the extreame danger I then found him in, yet being both
by himſelfe, his wife and all his friends earneſtly intreated to do my
vttermoſt endeauour to helpe him in this extremitie, and at leaſt to
eaſe him of theſe troubleſome accidents; ſo much by gliſters and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
mild meanes in two dayes ſpace I preuailed, that moſt of the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue-named
accidents vaniſhed quite away: his vrine alſo came in
great abundance, of a laudable colour, without any bad contents, and
the other egeſtion obſerued now a good and orderly courſe: the hicket
came but ſeldome, and with ſmall annoyance. But the pulſe
played not his part ſo well as I wiſhed, and the ſoreneſſe of his mouth
increaſed ſo faſt, that it began to get ground vpon his lips. The which
I then perceiuing, as likewiſe that he was not as yet free from his
Feauer, willing to trie if Phlebocomie would any thing auaile, I gaue
way to the vſing of this remedie. About ſixe ounces of very corrupt
bloud were taken from him on Saturday morning, (his noſe hauing
made ſome offer twice or thrice before, and once after his Phleboto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie)
not without alleuiation, whereupon enſued reaſonable good reſt
the night following. On Sonday morning was little alteration to be
diſcerned, but that he complained much of faintneſſe, and yet was bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
able to ſwallow then before: the ſoreneſſe of his mouth began like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
to amend, being duly dreſſed diuerſe times of the day: his hicket
alſo was no more to be heard. Not full two houres after our departure,
Death ſends him new ſummons by ſome change and alteration to the
worſe, which could not be concealed from the moſt vulgar eye. In the
afternoone viſiting him, I found no further hope or encouragement to
proceed, and yet farre leſſe on Monday morning, ſaue that I wiſhed
them ſtill to continue the giuing of him a Cordiall Inlep there in a
readineſſe, and ſo left viſiting him any more, and he ere nine of the
clocke at night, obeying Deaths laſt ſummons, diſcharged that debt
which we haue yet to pay.</p>
               <p>But now Maſter Parſon, our patient reſting in peace, I would
willingly expoſtulate a little concerning your careleſſe (and as I
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:4002:64"/>
thinke) irregular and ignorant proceeding in this buſineſſe,
which concerned no leſſe then a mans life: the life, I ſay, not of
an ordinary man, but of a magiſtrate, whom this corporation
could not ſo well at this time haue ſpared; beſides the intereſt
his wife and children and other friends had in him. In the firſt
place your Oracle being asked, it anſwered, His diſeaſe was a
blind Ague.<note place="margin">Raro aut nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam eiſdem accidentibus &amp; conditionibus in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignata apparet huiuſmodi febris, ſed pro varietate corporei appara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus &amp; aliarum rerum, quae cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus humanam mutare habent, variari ſubinde ipſam contingit. Mercat. tom. 2. lib. 7. cap. 2.</note> Of maligne Feauers I haue both read, and knowne
them poſſeſſe now and then ſome of my patients; but as for
blind Agues, we leaue them to Parſons that cannot ſee. And
what be the <hi>Pathognomonicke</hi> ſignes of a blind Ague, and what
Authors write of it? The vrine told you no ſuch matter, and I
dare ſay, the meſſenger was much amazed at ſo blind an Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle.
But this is no new practiſe of your ſelfe and others of your
cloth, leſt you ſhould ſeem to be ignorant of any thing, to coyne
new names for diſeaſes, whereof you are altogether ignorant.
And thus another of your double profeſſion, ſome few yeares
ago, his iudgement by a Gentleman concerning his diſeaſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
demanded, anſwered, It was a diſeaſe in his ſpirits. The
Gentleman died within a few dayes after of a Feauer, which
tooke poſſeſſion of the whole bodie; and a Phyſitian that came
afterwards to him, thought it to be a Squinancie, and that the
Parſon had wronged him in deferring Phlebotomie too long,
by the which he gaue the patient ſome eaſe for the preſent. If
this Parſon had euer learned the grounds of Phyſicke, he could
haue told that that Feauer which we call <hi>Ephemera,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gal. 1. de differ. febr. cap. 1.</note> not excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
foure and twentie houres, is properly ſaid to be in the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
being commonly free from danger: but if it exceed this
terme, then turneth it to ſome other Feauer, and ſo loſeth the
former name. But what remedies were by you appointed for
this patients blind Ague, as it pleaſeth you to call it? If a blind
Ague, it had as blind a remedie, a vomit was exhibited, Phle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>botomie
preſcribed. As for your vomit, although I neuer did
ſee it, yet I am not ignorant of the matter and nature of it. But
be what it would, that it was then vnſeaſonable, I thinke any
of common ſenſe cannot deny. For in the firſt place he had not
long bene ſicke, neither yet came his ſickneſſe by any ſurfet, to
induce you at firſt daſh to preſcribe him ſuch a vomit before
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:4002:64"/>
any other remedie. Againe, you ought not to be ignorant, that
in moſt diſeaſes (acute eſpecially) the appetite faileth at firſt,
and yet vſe we not alwayes to begin with ſtrong ſtibiate vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits.
But what were the effects of your vomit we haue heard,
and the patient fared the worſe for it. He was ſubiect to an old
paine in his head, and with this vnſeaſonable vomit the torrent
of thoſe ſharpe and maligne cholericke humours wherewith
his bodie abounded, were drawne vp towards the throate, and
other parts adioyning: hence had he that exulceration in his
throate and mouth, the hicket, &amp;c. I know your grauitie would
diſdaine the name of an Empiricke, but pardon me good maſter
Parſon, this courſe was too Empiricall. I wiſh both your ſelfe
and ſome of your brethren to be more circumſpect in exhibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
your vomits.<note place="margin">Strong ſtibiate vomits ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily vſed by our Parſon-practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers in moſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes, and for the moſt part with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the ſight of their patient.</note> It is too well knowne in the countrey, that

Phyſitian, often quoted in this Diſcourſe. This doctrine of
<hi>Thurnheuſers</hi> (ſaith<note n="*" place="margin">Guil. Adolph. Scribon. de in. ſpect. vrin. ſub finem.</note> he) cannot by any ſound argument be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated.
For admit that the vrine be ſeparated into ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
elements, according to the ſeuerall parts thereof, yet can
nothing but the elementarie qualities (as they call them) heat,
cold, &amp;c. be diſcerned by the ſame. And by this meanes ſhall
we onely be able to iudge of the diſeaſes of the ſolid parts; as
of obſtructions, exulcerations, and the like. And is not the
vrine an excrement of the bloud contained in the veines, that
is of one body? What vtilitie or profit therefore can come by
this ſeparation into ſeuerall parts? Thou ſhalt thus onely ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue
the number of the parts which are in the ſubſtance of the
bloud, and of what nature and kind it is. Thou mayeſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
perceiue it either to bee cauſed of Mercurie, Sulphur, or
Salt. But wilt thou ſtraight-waies maintaine, that all Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall
diſeaſes are ſeated in the head onely? &amp;c. If this bee true,
then will it follow, contrary to that which thou and <hi>Paracelſus</hi>
maintaine, that theſe three grounds or elements are not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
to all diſeaſes. For I am of opinion, that if we will needs
vſe the names of theſe three; as well ſuch diſeaſes as haue their
originall from this Sulphureous and ſalt matter, as any that
proceed from a Mercuriall cauſe, haue their root and originall
from the head,<note place="margin">Abſurditie of this opinion.</note> &amp;c. Thus farre our Author. And may not this
opinion ſeeme ſo abſurd in it ſelfe, that it needeth no further
confutation? For if when thou hadſt vſed all thy art and cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
a countrey-man ſhould aske thine opinion concerning
his vrine, and thou ſhouldſt tell him hee were troubled with
ſome ſulphureous, Mercuriall, or ſaltiſh and tartareous diſeaſe,
would he not laugh thee to ſcorne, and thinke, it may be, thou
hadſt beene that day too well acquainted with ſome pots and
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:4002:68"/>
pipes of Tobacco? And if hee ſhould deſire to know what
were his particular diſeaſe, and where or what particular part
of the body it had taken vp for its abode; would it ſeeme
ſtrange if he looked for ſome extraordinary skill after ſo great
an outward oftentation? And if he ſhould go home and tell
his wife of a Tartareous, Sulphureous, or Mercuriall diſeaſe,
who knowes but ſhe might call him Good-man Wood-cocke
for telling her ſuch a tale of <hi>Robin-hood?</hi> But put the caſe thou
mighteſt yet ſee ſome Sulphureous diſeaſe (as they terme it)
by meanes of this ſeparation and diſtillation; yet amongſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
ſuch Sulphureous diſeaſes, vpon which of them wouldſt
thou faſten thy coniecture? As if a Feauer might be found out,
how may the kind be knowne, whether a continuall or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittent;
and whether ſymptomaticall or dependant vpon
ſome other diſeaſe; or elſe be it ſelfe a principall gueſt,
with many moe circumſtances? The like may be ſaid of the
other two principles. So that it may euidently appeare, there
is greater vncertaintie in this then the other way. But if they
will be ſo skilfoole, I wiſh they would diſtill the other excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
alſo; for I am ſure they may learne of both alike. But
yet wiſh I them to take this <hi>Prouiſo</hi> with them, that the ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings
of their ſtils and Alembicks be well luted with <hi>lutum
moſchatum,</hi> or <hi>ambarinum,</hi> that none of this fragrant ſmell be
carried away with the wind, and ſo ſome part of this precious
liquor loſt. But it may be, when the patient had caſt vp his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
he would find this manner of caſting of waters, as they
terme it, more coſtly then the ordinary. But for my part, I wiſh
our vrine-mongers would vſe it: for by this meanes this great
abuſe might the better be ſuppreſſed. But this opinion being
ſo abſurd in it ſelfe, needeth no further confutation. But fearing
ſome infection, or at leaſt annoyance to my noſe by ſuch Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curiall
and Sulphureous ſmels, I thinke it is more then time to
withdraw my ſelfe out of ſo ſtinking a place. The like libertie
is allowed thee kind Reader, to whom I am afraid I haue now
bene too tedious; but yet I muſt once againe intreat thy pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence

rather to be buried in obliuion: and after ſome further diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
concerning that ſubiect (all which notwithſtanding, would not
ſatisfie her more then nice curioſitie) he taketh his leaue for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent.
A few dayes after, cauſing carefully to watch and obſerue the
actions of this Aeſculapius, he was obſerued to go to a certaine place
within two little leagues of Paris, called</hi> Bois de Vincennes, <hi>that is,</hi>
Vincence wood, <hi>and there to dig vp certaine rootes. The Phyſitian
therewith acquainted, reſorteth thither with ſpeed, and finds that it
was nothing elſe but a certaine kind of Spurge (whereof there grew
in that place and about no ſmall ſtore) whereof this Clowne had at
ſeuerall times digged vp great ſtore, eaſily diſcerned by the holes there
round about that place, ſome being but new digged. After a narrow
ſearch, he found that moſt of thoſe whom this new Aeſculapius was
ſaid to haue cured, either died after a certaine time of a bloudie
Fluxe, this violent medicine hauing procured an excoriation in their
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:4002:71"/>
guts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> being especially exhibited, without any preparation of the ill
qualitie, or obſeruation of the due doſe or quantitie: or elſe that they
liued a languiſhing life, worſe then a ſpeedie dispatch by a ſudden
death, from whoſe mercileſſe clawes notwithſtanding this former
Purgatorie was not able to free ſome of them. The Phyſitian repai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
againe to the Ducheſſe, acquainteth her Grace with theſe ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
circumſtances: as alſo that it ſeemed most of thoſe people were
able, ſtrong, and cacochymicall bodies, who would preferre the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell
of this Clowne, before that of the learned and iudicious Phyſitian.</hi>
The iſſue notwithſtanding did make it appeare, that if any did
recouer, it came not to paſſe through his skill or ſufficiencie,
which as ſeemeth, was none at all, but by the ſtrength of nature,
able to expell both the Plague and the poyſon of the medicine.
The learned and iudicious Phyſitians againe met for the moſt
part with thin and tender bodies, brought vp in eaſe and idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
and for this cauſe apteſt to receiue the poyſoned impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
of the peſtilentiall aire, and therefore the diſeaſe prouing
greater then the meanes were able to ouercome, the patients
were often forced to faint vnder the burthen. Neither were
ſuch dangerous, or r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

vſed, in their opinions to be adminiſtred to any, much leſſe to
perſons of qualitie and weake conſtitution. The Noble woman
hauing heard the Phyſitians apologie, was afterwards better
pleaſed with her Phyſitian, and after that time conceiued a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
opinion, both of the Art and the profeſſors of the ſame. I
was likewiſe informed during my abode at Leua in Germanie,<note place="margin">Dangerous me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines exhibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by Paracel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts.</note>
of many rare cures ſeemed to be performed by that medicine
which they call the <hi>Philoſophers ſtone, Aurum potabile,</hi> and many
other ſuch hyperbolicall medicines, exhibited by the Paracel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts
of thoſe parts. And yet moſt of them to whom they were
exhibited, before the full period of a twelue moneth, went to
viſite their friends in another world: and little better ſucceſſe
for the moſt part had their maiſter <hi>Paracelſus</hi> himſelfe.</p>

a certaine Empiricke, and Iriſh by nation, was accounted one of the
moſt famous vrine-mongers in all the countrey about, but eſpecially
in telling whether women were with child or no. And yet his skill in

Phyſicke was confined to one forme of purge, compoſed of a certaine
portion of the Electuarie <hi>Diaphoenico<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> mingled with ſo much powder
of <hi>Diagridium</hi> as he could take vp betweene his finger &amp; his thomb,

other euill accidents, as I haue heard ſince from ſome of themſelues:
