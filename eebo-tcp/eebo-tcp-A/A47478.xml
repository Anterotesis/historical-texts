            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>The King's Reaſons</hi> (With ſome <hi>Reflections</hi> upon them) For withdrawing himſelf from <hi>Rocheſter,</hi> written with his own Hand, (<hi>Or rather Copied from his own Speech after the Bawdy Affi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>davit.</hi>) and ordered by him to be publiſhed, (<hi>By</hi> Henry Hills, <hi>but that he was out of the way.</hi>)</head>
            <p>THE World cannot wonder at my withdrawing my ſelf now this ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond time, (<hi>or rather making my</hi> Exit <hi>from a Stage, where, after I had plaid my laſt Act, there was nothing more to be done.</hi>) I might have expected ſomewhat better uſage, after what I had Writ to the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> by my Lord <hi>Feverſham,</hi> and the Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions I gave him, (<hi>that is, to have been reſtor'd as I was, with all my Prieſts and Iriſh about me.</hi>) But inſteed of an Anſwer, ſuch as I might have hoped for, (<hi>had I deſerved it</hi>) What was I to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect after the Uſage I received by the making the ſaid Earl a Priſoner, againſt the Practice and Law of Nations; (<hi>though it was an over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight in me, indeed, to ſend an Obnoxious Perſon of my Errand, and he neither Ambaſſador, Herauld, Drummer nor Trumpeter.</hi>) The ſending his own Guards at Eleven a Clock at Night to take Poſſeſſion of the Poſts at <hi>White-hall,</hi> without advertizing me in the leaſt manner of it. (<hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there was no occaſion for it.</hi>) The ſending to me at one of the Clock, after Midnight, when I was in Bed, a kind of an Order by three Lords, to be gone out of my own Palace, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore 12 that ſame Morning? (<hi>But perhaps they wanted my Room, not my Company, and then what ſayes the Proverb,</hi> Cede Majoribus.) After all this, How could I hope to be ſafe, (<hi>And yet 'twas well I was no ſafer,</hi>) in the power of one who had not only done this to me, (<hi>Which was juſt nothing at all.</hi>) and Invaded my Kingdoms without any juſt occaſion given for it, (<hi>but my going about to ruin the Eſtabliſhed Government of the Nation and the Proteſtant Religion. Though now I better recollect my ſelf, I cannot call it an Inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion neither, becauſe he came in at the ſolemn Invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the Nobility and Gentry of my whole Realm.</hi>) but that did by his firſt Declaration lay the greateſt Aſperſion upon me that Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice could Invent, in that Clauſe of it which concerns my (<hi>Adopted</hi>) Son. I appeal to all that know me, nay, even to himſelf, that in their Conſciences, neither he nor they can believe me in the leaſt capable of ſo unnatural a Villany, nor of ſo little common ſenſe, to be Impoſed on in a thing of ſuch a nature as that. (Vid. <hi>My Speech to the Lords in my Book of Midwifery,</hi> Fol. 36, 37.) What had I then to expect from one, who by all Arts hath taken ſuch pains to make me appear as Black as Hell to my own People, as well as to all the World beſides? What Effect that hath had at home, all Mankind have ſeen, by ſo general a defecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in my Army, (<hi>Becauſe they would not fight with their Bodeis againſt their Souls.</hi>) as well as in the Nation amongſt all ſorts of People. (<hi>All which I drew upon my ſelf, as is well known by the Reaſons of the Lords, for inviting in His Royal Highneſs the Prince of</hi> Orange, <hi>by my Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearing to pernicious Popiſh Councils, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to ſettle a Popiſh Succeſſion, to advance the Kingdom of Antichriſt: And I did ill to ſay</hi> One, <hi>when the crie againſt me was ſo univerſal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I was Born Free, and deſire to continue ſo; and tho I have ventur'd my Life very frank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on ſeveral occaſions for the Good and Honour of my Country, (<hi>in needleſs Wars for the deſtruction of the Proteſtant Religion</hi>) and am free to do it again, and which I hope I ſhall yet do, as old as I am; to redeem it from the Slavery it is like to fall under (<hi>God forbid it, for 'tis ill falling into the hands of an Exaſperated Prince.</hi>) Yet I think it not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient to expoſe my ſelf to be ſecur'd (<hi>which might eaſily have been done, had it been thought convenient,</hi>) as not to be at liberty to effect it, and for that reaſon to withdraw (<hi>tho fore-warn'd fore-arm'd you'l ſay</hi>) but ſo as to be within call, when the Nations eyes ſhall be open'd (<hi>by putting on a huge pair of Jeſuitical Spectacles</hi>) to ſee how they have been Abus'd and Impos'd upon by the ſpecious pretences of Religion and Property, (<hi>which I was going about to deſtroy.</hi>) I hope it will pleaſe God to touch their Hearts, to make them ſenſible of the ill condition they are in, and bring them to ſuch a Temper, that a Legal Parliament may be call'd (<hi>tho this Prayer be needleſs, for I hear ſuch a Parliament, a thing I ne're intended in my Life, is at hand</hi>) and that among other things which may be done, they will agree for Liberty of Conſcience, for all Proteſtant Diſſenters (<hi>tho I ſpeak not this from my heart</hi>) and that thoſe of my own Perſwaſion may be ſo far conſider'd as to have a ſhare in it, as they may live peaceably and quietly (<hi>till they ſhall be in a condition again, as ſoon as may be, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge my Cauſe</hi>) as Engliſh-men and Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans ought to do (<hi>with Plots and Maſſacres</hi>) and not be oblig'd to tranſplant themſelves, which would be very grievous, eſpecially to ſuch as love their own Country (<hi>ſo long as it is in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to the Pope</hi>) and I appeal to all Men, who are conſidering Men, whither any thing can make this Nation ſo Great and Flouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as <hi>Liberty of Conſcience. (There's no body queſtions it, but</hi>) ſome of our Neighbours dread it (<hi>eſpecially the French Clergy,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I could add much more to confirm all I have ſaid, but now is not the proper time: (<hi>Enough a conſcience, and more than will be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd this Hundred Years.</hi>
