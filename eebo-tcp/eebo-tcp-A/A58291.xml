         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Generall Assembly.</head>
            <p>THe Kings Majestie having declared, that it is his
Royall will and pleasure, that all Questions about
Religion and matters Ecclesiasticall, be determined
by the Church: having also by publike Proclamation
Indicted this free <hi>Nationall Assembly,</hi> for setling the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
distractions of this Church; and for establishing a
perfect Peace, against such divisions and discords), as
have been sore displeasing to his Majestie, and grievous to
all his good Subjects. And now his Majesties Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioner
<hi>Iohn E. of Traquair,</hi> instructed and authorized with
a full Commission, being present and sitting in this As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblie,
now fully conveened and orderly constitute, in
all the members thereof, according to the order of this
Church having at large declared his Majesties zeal to the
Reformed Religion; and his Royall care, and tender
affection to this Church; (where his Majestie had both
his Birth and Baptisme) his great displeasure at the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold
distractions, and divisions of this Church and
Kingdome; and his desire to have all our wounds per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
cured, with a faire and Fatherly hand. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
in the way approved by this Church, tryall hath
been taken in former Assemblies before from the Church
Registers to our full satisfaction. Yet the <hi>Commissioner</hi>
making a particular inquirie, from the members of the
Assembly now solemnly conveened concerning the reall
and true causes, of so many and great evils at this time
past, and so sore troubling the Peace of the Church and
Kingdome. It was represented to his Majesties <hi>Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioner</hi>
by this Assembly; That besides many other, the
maine and most materiall causes were,</p>
            <p>1. First, the pressing of this Church by Prelates with a
<hi>Service Booke,</hi> or <hi>Booke of Common Prayer,</hi> without dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
or warrant from the Church, and containing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
the Popish frame thereof, divers Popish errours, and
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:94711:4"/>
Ceremonies; and the seeds of manifold grosse superstitions,
and Idolatrie: with a Book of <hi>Canons,</hi> without warrant er di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
from the <hi>Generall Assembly;</hi> establishing a Tyrannicall
power over the Church in the person of Bishop; and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwing
the whole discipline and government of the Church
by Assemblies<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with a Book of <hi>Consecration, and Ordination,</hi>
without warrant of authoritie Civill or Ecclesiasticall, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing
Offices in the house of God, which are not warrant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the Word of God; and repugnant to the Discipline and
Acts of our Church: with the Commission erected without
the consent of the Church, subverting the Jurisdiction and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie
Judicatories of this Church; and giving to persons
meerly Ecclesiasticall the power of both Swords; &amp; to persons
meerly Civill, the power of the Keyes and Church Censures.</p>
            <p>2. A second cause was the Articles of <hi>Perth (viz.)</hi> Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of Festivall dayes; kneeling at the Communion; Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation;
Administration of the Sacraments in private places
which were brought in by a Civill Assembly; and are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the Confession of Faith 1590 as it was meant and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
in <hi>Ann.</hi> 1580. and divers times since to the order and
Constitution of this Church.</p>
            <p>3. A third cause was, the change of the Government of the
Church, from the Assemblies of the Church to the persons of
Church-men; usurping the priority and power over their bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
by the way, and under the name of Episcopall govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
against the Confession, <hi>Anno</hi> 1580. Against the order
set down in the Book of Policy; and against the intentions and
Constitutions of this Church from the beginning.</p>
            <p>4. A fourth cause was, the Civill places and power of Church
men, their sitting in Session, Counsell, and Exchequer: Their
Ridding sitting and voting in Parliament; and their sitting
in the Bench as Justices of Peace, which according to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions
of the Church, are incompatible with their spiritual
function, lifting up above their brethren, and worldly pomp,
and do tend to the hinderance of the Ministry.</p>
            <p>A fifth cause was, The keeping and authorizing of corrupt
Assemblies at <hi>Linlithgow</hi> 1606. 1608. at <hi>Glasgow</hi> 1610. at <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berdene
1616.</hi> at S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Andrews</hi> 1617. at <hi>Perth</hi> 1618. which are

to introduce Novations within this Church, against the

            <p>A sixt cause was, The want of lawfull and free Generall As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies,

Church, expressed in the <hi>Book of Policy,</hi> and acknowledged in

all objections to the contrary being answered to the full. The
whole Assembly with expresse consent of his Majesties Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioner,

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions
of the Generall Assemblies of this Church, and upon
the grounds respective above specified, that the foresaid <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
Booke, Book of Cannons, and Ordination,</hi> and High Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
be rejected still: That the <hi>Articles</hi> of <hi>Perth</hi> be no more
practised: That Episcopall Government and the Civill places
and power of Churchmen, be holden still as unlawfull in this
Church: That the above named pretended Assemblies at <hi>Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lithgow</hi>
1606. 1608. at <hi>Glasgow</hi> 1610. at <hi>Aberdean</hi> 1616. at <hi>St.
