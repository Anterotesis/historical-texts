            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Mr. <hi>Speaker,</hi> who can frame an argument a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, unlesse he can tell against what hee is to argue?</p>
            <p>Would you confute the Convocation-house, they were a holy Synod, they were Comissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners? will you dispute their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               </gap>? they will mingle all power together and perhaps

            <p>Mr. <hi>Speaker,</hi> I have conferred with some of the Founders of those <hi>Cannons,</hi> but I professe here, that I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               </gap> never meet with any one of that Assembly, who could well answere to that first question of the Catechisme, <hi>What is your name?</hi> Alas, they were parted before they knew what they west, when they were together.</p>
            <p>The summe of all the severall answeres that I have received, doe altogether amount unto this: They were a Convocationall, Synodicall Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly of Commissioners: Indeed a threefold <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mera,</hi> a Monster to our Lawes, a <hi>Cerberus</hi> to our Religion.

                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> when the Parliament was dead. A strange holy Synod, when the one part never saw nor conferred with the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>But indeed, there needed no conference, if it be true of these Cannons which I read of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, <hi>Quis nescit, Canones Lambetha formari prius<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam in Synodo ventilentur?</hi>

            <p>YEsterday wee did regulate the most im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant businesse before us: and gave them motion, so that our great and weighty affaires, are now on their feete in their progresse, iourning on towards their severall pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riods, where some I hope will finde their latest home.</p>
            <p>Yet among all these I observe one, a very maine one, to sleepe <hi>sine die:</hi> give me leave to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waken it; it is a businesse of an immense weight, and worth; such as deserves our best care, and most severe circumspection. I meane the Grand Petition long since given in by many thousand Citizens against the dominering Clergy.</p>
            <p>Wherein (for my part) although I cannot ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove of all that is presented unto you, yet I doe clearely professe, that a great part of it, nay the greatest part thereof, is so well grounded, that

my heart goes cheerefully along therewith.</p>

            <p>The same grievances which the Cittie groans under, are provinciall unto us, and I much feare they are Nationall among us all.</p>
            <p>The pride, the avarice, the ambition and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression, by our ruling Clergy is <hi>Epidemicall,</hi> it hath infected them all. There is not any, or scarce any of them who is not practicall in their owne <hi>great cause in hand,</hi> which they impiously doe mis-call, <hi>the Piety of the times,</hi> but in truth, so wrong a Piety, that I am bold to say,

            <p>Here in this Petition is the disease represented, here is the cure intreated.</p>
            <p>The number of your Petitioners is considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, being above five &amp; twenty hundred names, and would have beene foure times as many, if that were thought materiall.</p>
            <p>The matter in the Petition is of high import: But your Petitioners themselves are all of them quiet and silent at their owne houses, humbly expecting &amp; praying the resolution of this great <hi>Senate,</hi> upon these their earnest and thrice hearty desires.</p>
