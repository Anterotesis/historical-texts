            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <bibl>GAL. vi.10.</bibl>
               <q>As we have therefore opportunity, let us do good unto all men, especially unto them who are of the Houshold of Faith.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hese Friendly and Charitable Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, Men, Fathers and Brethren, you have now, by the blessing of God, for several years, renew'd with no just offence to any, though with the grief, and envy perhaps of some, who are not of our Houshold of Faith; but to the comfort of all that are; for the present benefit, and relief
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:51114:4"/>
of many, and with well-grounded hopes, and presages of much greater things for the future.</p>
            <p>Of these our Annual Solemnities there being two principal intentions; the one to answer a most unjust objection of the Enemies to the married Clergy, by shewing a full ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of their Children, who are in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to credit the Church, and serve their Country; The other, for relieving those of the same descent, who may have been reduc'd to Distress, and Poverty: For the first of these, I need no other defence, no other commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, than this very Company, to which I speak. For what Argument, either Civil, or Ecclesiastical, can justify, can commend the Marriage of Church-men, and vindicate our whole Reformation on that account, if this Sight be not sufficient to do it? This Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly? The lawful Offspring of such Marriages, the genuine Seed, the proper Issue of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation; and if you permit me to say it, I dare say, the Honour of it too. An Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly compos'd of men considerable in all wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Professions; eminent in many wayes of life; all honest wayes, some venerable, some honourable: Men favour'd by God in your Birth, your Education, your several Stations
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:51114:4"/>
in this world: so far above what the Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries of our Church most injuriously upbraid, so far above contempt or meaness, that you are plentifully bless'd by our gracious God with ablilities; and, which is more, endued by him with hearts too, to do good to others.</p>
            <p>In that part therefore of our design in this Meeting, which concerns the vindication of our whole Race; I will use no other Apology; if I intended a Panegyric, I should need no other, but only this one unanswerable, living Argument, which you your selves here pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent afford me.</p>
            <p>The other great end of it, which is Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty towards those of the like original with our selves, whom their necessities may have made unable, asham'd perhaps, to appear amongst us at this time; the Recommendation of so prudent, so pious a work, deserves certainly to be the chief subject of the Preacher, the chief duty of the Hearers, and Preacher, in all such Assemblies of men of our extraction; and in this of this year, in a special manner, for an extraordinary cause.</p>
            <p>For your former worthy beginnings of this kind having lately receiv'd incouragment by a Royal Establishment; I cannot but believe.
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:51114:5"/>
that this advantage has inspir'd all your hearts with the most chearful resolutions, to perfect, by the help of so great a Patronage, what you your selves had before so generously attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: that what you have hitherto done in your private bounty, as a secret Free-will Offering, you will persevere to do, and do much more, now you are invited to it by publick Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; now you are admitted by the King him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self into a share with him, as I may say, in one of his most Sacred Offices; are become <hi>Nursing Fathers</hi> too of the Church:<note place="margin">Esa. 49.23.</note> He of the flourishing part; you under him, of the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted part of the Church of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wherefore, intreating first your favourable interpretation, that by reason of the sickness of the Reverend Prelate, who had undertaken this employment, I have been over-ruled to approach this place, so much out of my own order, so very much in all things unequal to those, who have gone before me; that I may (now I am here) be somewhat serviceable to the great Charitable design of this Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I have chosen to speak on this Scripture: In which we find a serious Exhortation of the Apostle to all manner of Charity, In its largest extent; <hi>The doing good to all men</hi>! And then
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:51114:5"/>
directed, and limited in two particulars, of Time, and Persons. It is to be practised with regard to some Times above others: we are to do good, <hi>As we have an opportunity.</hi> It should be with a careful choice and preference of some persons above others: To All, but <hi>espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially to the Houshold of Faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>According to this plain Method, my follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Discourse will be most naturally divided.</p>
            <p>First, As the Foundation of all, we are to suppose this most Christian Principle, That, by the obligation of our Holy Faith, we are all indispensably bound <hi>to do good to all men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, We may observe, That though our Charity should be universal, yet as it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be actually exercised, but on particular times, so it should be chiefly on special <hi>opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, We must conclude, That the true, Evangelical Charity may, and should admit of different measures and degrees; though it ought not to be confined to any, yet should principally be applied <hi>to the Houshold of Faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That the true Profession of Christianity in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>violably engages all its followers, to do good to all men, I will not here much labour to
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:51114:6"/>
prove, but rather take it for granted; the very repetition of this truth giving a sufficient con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation to it, in any Assembly of true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians; much more in such a one, as you are; whose Fathers, by virtue of their Holy Office, were appointed the special Guardians of the great Doctrine of Charity, and Teachers of it to the rest of the world. To you therefore it may well be esteemed as a domestic Doctrine, received by you almost with your first milk, as one of the very first Elements of your Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</p>
            <p>A Doctrine, that is represented to our im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect indeed, but yet to our sincere imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in the glorious, primitive Patern of most perfect, most adorable goodness in the Divine Nature it self: by which the whole Frame of the Creation, the whole stock of Mankind, the sound, the unsound part, the good, the bad, were all made, and have been always sustain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and encompassed with such inexpressible Grace, such unbounded Mercy, as is always ready for those that desire it; always finds out those that seek for it; often stands in the way of those, that would avoid it; and overtakes them that flye from it.</p>
            <p>From that most blessed Original of doing
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:51114:6"/>
good, that is essential to the infinite Being of our Creator, we have an excellent Copy transcribed for all our use in the Gospel; here made necessary to us by innumerable Precepts; here illustrated to us by a most gracious Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample; here made easie for us by Promises of Divine Assistance; here rendred pleasant and profitable to us by assurances of unspeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Rewards.</p>
            <p>This Doctrine of Gods good-will towards men; this command of mens proportionable good-will to one another, is not this the very Body and Substance, this the very Spirit and Life of our Saviours whole Institution? It is intermingled with all the Truths He teaches: It overspreads and gives one colour to all his Precepts; 'tis the very distinguishing Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of the Christian Law; by which that has exceeded, and advanced all the true Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctates of Natural Reason; by which it has ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell'd, and put to shame all the best Preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of false Worships; nay by which God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self seems to have made the last Addition to his own Discoveries and Instructions to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind: For as in many other things the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel appears in respect of the Law to be a clearer Revelation of the mystical part; so
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:51114:7"/>
in this it is apparently a far more benign, more generous Dispensation of the practical part of the True Religion.</p>
            <p>In this matter, what need we Christians be our own Witnesses, or our own Judges? We might refer the examination of it to any so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber judicious Heathen, or unprejudic'd Jew, if any such could be found. 'Tis true, they might at first sight observe the common pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of too many, that call themselves Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, to be very different from the Doctrine they seem to own. They might justly won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that men so taught, so obliged to be kind to all, gentle to Strangers, merciful to the Afflicted, loving even to Enemies, should behave themselves in every point so contrary to such heavenly Instructions, such indissoluble Obligations! that so many, that any fierce, stubborn, revengeful, avaritious, uncharitable Passions could possibly spring up under the shadow of such a Religion! nay, that some men should make such a Religion, and their Zeal for it, to be the pretence, and excuse even to justifie, even to sanctifie such passions!</p>
            <p>All this the Adversaries of the Faith have too much reason to object against too many of its Professors; but against the Faith it self
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:51114:7"/>
nothing at all. In that all things of this nature must excite their admiration, or overwhelm them with confusion. Should the wisest Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then search into all the highest flights of their best Moralists; should the most devout <hi>Iew</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collect the most virtuous Counsels, and Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of their Patriarchs, and Prophets; and then should both these compare what they can find in either of them, with the free-spirited, the large-hearted, the universally-charitable design of the whole tenour of our Blessed Saviours Teaching, and Life; and that unanimously ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded by all the inspired Writers after him; and they must both at last agree, that here are introduc'd far more Heroic Principles of Meekness, Forgiveness, Bounty, and Magna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimity, than ever all the Learning of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens could invent, or all the Antiquity of the <hi>Iews</hi> could boast of.</p>
            <p>What could the light of Nature, what could the Mosaical shadows, which yet were clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than that; what could either of these pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce that is comparable to the true Evangelical Spirit? By our Law of doing Good, no good is to be left undone towards all, not the good of the Tongue, the Hand, the Heart; none is to be done unwillingly to any; none only for our

own sakes; none only in one season, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways. Here are confirm'd all our other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, Civil, Political tyes of Mutual good Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices; nay here, when they are not, or can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be Mutual: Here many new Titles of kindness, many new Relations of endearment are superadded to them: Here the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, the desires, the occasions of Envy, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, Coveteousness Revenge are abolish'd: Here a new race of Virtues, and Graces more Divine, more Moral, more Humane are planted in their stead.</p>
            <p>If I will believe, and obey the Gospel, no difference of outward condition, no Calamity, no Misery can make any man not to be equal to me, or to deserve my neglect: no distance of Place, no strangeness of Country, no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariety of Temper, or Interest can make any Man a stranger to me, or to deserve my indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference: no ill Will, no ill Speech, no ill Deed of another against me can make any Man an Enemy to me, or to deserve my ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred. With Men indeed these considerations are usually, naturally the causes of Despite, Disdain, or Aversion from others: But with God they seem to pass for so many new rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of our greater tenderness towards others;
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:51114:8"/>
even as so many new degrees of our Consan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guinity with them.</p>
            <p>Should we not do good to Strangers? The Gospel allows no such term, as a Stranger: makes every man my Neighbour. Should we not forgive our Enemies? those that Curse, Persecute, and would Destroy us? The Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel knows no such thing, as an Enemy. <hi>We are to bless,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 5.44.</note> 
               <hi>to pray for, to love our Enemies</hi>: and if not for that very reason, yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing it. Ought we not to pity, and sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the Poor, and Afflicted, though they have no Relation to us? No Relation? That can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be. The Gospel styles them all, our Brethren: nay they have a nearer Relation to us, our fellow Members: and both these from their Relation to our Saviour himself; who calls them his Brethren, his Members; and makes them his proper Charge, his peculiar Care: Titles of Honour and Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges which the Rich, and the Great, as such, can never deserve; and will never have, unless they employ their Riches, and Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, for the help, and protection of these the true Wards, and Children, and Friends of God.</p>
            <p>Wherefore since we are to do good, to the Poor, to Strangers, to Enemies; those whom
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:51114:9"/>
Nature is too apt to make us Despise, Disregard, or Hate; then undoubtedly we are to do good <hi>to all Men,</hi> To all Men, <hi>as we have an opportunity,</hi> which is my second particular.</p>
            <p>I cannot but take notice of the fulness of the Original Phrase in this place. For though it is evident, that the Holy Ghost is scarce ever so Various, and Copious, and Efficacious, on a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny one Divine Argument, as when it recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends to us the great duty of Charity; yet there are few expressions, on this very subject, so expressive; none, I think, more powerful than this, throughout the whole Scripture.</p>
            <p>First 'tis here said, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>ã in non-Latin alphabet ã</desc>
               </gap>, A Word, that signifies, not only some empty good will, and good wishes; not only some verbal assistance, or the cold comfort of barren pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises; not only some slender kind of good work, perform'd by chance, with little cost, or no pains; but an active, expensive, inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fatigable goodness; such as our Apostle, else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where,<note place="margin">1 Thess. 1.3. Heb. 6.10.</note> in two several places, calls <hi>a work, and labour of Love.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly 'tis said, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>ã in non-Latin alphabet ã</desc>
               </gap>, which may be translated not only <hi>doing Good,</hi> but <hi>the Good</hi>; the Good I suppose, that others necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties most call for, and our circumstances most
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:51114:9"/>
enable us to perform; and so implying much cautious Care, and Cicumspection, in suiting the kinds of our relief to our own abilities, and to the wants of those we would relieve. And a doing good in this wise manner, this truly-Gospel sense, is a wonderful addition to the good action it self. Of so beautiful, and ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able a thing as Charity is, nothing can more increase the Lustre, and Beauty, than a pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent election of Objects, and a fit application of it to them. In good works, as in all other good things, there may be goodness in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, but Decence, and Gracefulness can be only in the particulars, in doing the good.</p>
            <p>Thirdly therefore, To make this decence of our Beneficence compleat, 'tis added, That we must do it, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>ã in non-Latin alphabet ã</desc>
               </gap>. <hi>As we have opportunity.</hi> Most of the Learned Versions on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly render it, <hi>whilest we have time</hi>: whilest by the favour, and long-suffering of Almighty God, our frail, and uncertain Lives are, for this very end, prolong'd to us in this World: which is our chief opportunity of doing Good; as after this Life; begins Gods chief opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of recompensing us for so doing. But in all works of Bounty, and Liberality, something more is to be consider'd besides the occasion of
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:51114:10"/>
the Givers: and that is the occasion of the Receivers; and therefore our Translation takes in both, rightly saies, not only whilest we have time, but, <hi>as we have opportunity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Opportunity is in respect to time, in some sense, as time is in respect to Eternity. 'Tis the small Moment, the exact Point, the criti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Minute, on which every good work so much depends; that whenever you just light upon it, it is able to make all your Religious performances more easy to your selves, more beneficial to others, more acceptable to God himself. Has not every common action of life, every virtue in Morality, and so every grace in Christianity its due season, its proper time? out of which whenever it is practis'd, I will not say it changes its Nature, and becomes evil; but most truly it loses very much of the comeliness, and vigor, and ornament of its goodness.</p>
            <p>There is,<note place="margin">Eccles. 3.1.</note> saies the Wiseman, <hi>a season, and time,</hi> that is, <hi>an opportunity to every thing</hi>: the same which the Poet means, when he saies <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>ã in non-Latin alphabet ã</desc>
               </gap>
               <g ref="char:punc">âª</g>
               <note place="margin">Hesiod. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>ã in non-Latin alphabet ã</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> So your Christian For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, and Patience have their <hi>opportunity,</hi> in times of Affliction, and Persecution: So your Temperance, and Humility have theirs, in Plenty, and Prosperity, especially unexpected
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:51114:10"/>
Prosperity; so your Devotion has its <hi>opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi>:<note place="margin">Ephes. 6.18.</note> 
               <hi>We must Pray always,</hi> but chiefly at certain times: on stated Days, in most solemn Places: so your Fasting, Contrition and Mortificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, when the Church and State appoints, and that especially in times of greater Riot and Luxury: so true Zeal, in times overflowing with Atheism and Prophaness: so Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and Christian Prudence, in times a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounding with blind and furious Zeal: so all the rest; so Charity has its <hi>opportunity,</hi> as well as the rest.</p>
            <p>Indeed so diffusive, so comprehensive, so ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholic a Grace is Charity above any of the rest, that whatever time is the special <hi>opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi> of any other moral Virtue, or Christian Grace, that very time is also the special <hi>oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity</hi> of Charity. It must immediately, inse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parably attend all your Christian Fortitude, your Patience, your Devotion, your Mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, your Prudence, your Zeal. In what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Heart, or Head any one of these takes possession, it must never go single; it must bring Charity with it, or it is there it self in vain.<note place="margin">Psal. 149.9</note> 
               <hi>Mercy is over all Gods works,</hi> and should be in all ours.</p>
            <p>Such is the large <hi>opportunity</hi> of Charity,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:51114:11"/>
whereby it is made the constant Companion and Perfection of all Virtues; impower'd to enter into every one of their Provinces: and well it is for that Virtue, where it most en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and longest stayes. Indeed so much em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment it has, that whoever shall read over St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s enumeration of the Duties in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent upon it,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 13.</note> he might almost conclude, that well-nigh the whole business of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity is laid on the shoulders of Charity alone. <hi>Charity bears all,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Verse 7.</note> 
               <hi>believes all, hopes all, endures all,</hi> and much more to the same purpose. What can be spoken more effectually? Whereas the same Apostle, in the same Chapter, tells us, That <hi>of the three things which remain,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Verse 13.</note> 
               <hi>Faith, Hope and Charity, the greatest is Charity</hi>; here much more is said; not only that it is greater than Faith, and Hope, but that <hi>it believes all, hopes all it self</hi>: has all these other Graces, and their <hi>opportunities,</hi> contained within it self.</p>
            <p>Certainly therefore Charity is the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>ã in non-Latin alphabet ã</desc>
               </gap> here intended; not only a good, not only the chiefgood, but that without which nothing else can be good.</p>
            <p>Yet besides this general <hi>opportunity</hi> of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, which, you see, is common to it with all other goodness: it has also many Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:51114:11"/>
peculiar to it self. As when it is to be practis'd towards persons of great, and unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd Wants, or of extraordinary Merits, or of extraordinary Demerits: That is one great <hi>op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity</hi> of Charity. Or when in places, that can shew very few, and little, or very great, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny instances of Beneficence: That is another of its <hi>opportunities</hi>; that where there are few, and small examples of good works, they may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creas'd; where there are many, and great, they may be incouraged to continue. Or in times of public Fasting, Mourning, and Humiliation; that is another <hi>opportunity</hi> of it: For the best sign, and fruit of denying our selves, is mercy to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. Or in times of Thanksgiving, of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable Temporal or Spiritual Blessings; in times of Joy, and Feasting, and enlargement of Heart; that is another. In all such times, when we more freely enjoy the bounty of God our selves; we make it an imputation to us, if we do not take care, that others also shall partake of some good by it. Such honest re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshments, and comforts of Life, our Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Liberty has made it lawful for us to use: our Temperance, and Sobriety in using them will make them innocent: But nothing can render them truely Christian Comforts, except
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:51114:12"/>
the mixture of some good work of Kindness, and Liberality with them.</p>
            <p>And therefore the only Feasts we read of in Scripture,<note place="margin">Jude v. 12.</note> amongst the Primitive Christians, besides the great Feast of the Holy Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, were their <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>ã in non-Latin alphabet ã</desc>
               </gap>, their Feasts of Charity. <hi>Cicero</hi> brings in <hi>Cato</hi> reproving the Levity of the <hi>Greeks,</hi>

               </gap>, from their drinking then together; and rather commends the Gravity of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> who nam'd such meetings <hi>Convivia,</hi> from their Living, and Conversing then to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. But we Christians have another man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of example to follow, from our first Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decessors <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>ã in non-Latin alphabet ã</desc>
               </gap> of which the very word may teach us our duty in them:<note place="margin">Tertul. Apol. cap. 39. <hi>where they are describ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi>
               </note> For these took their Name not from the Mirth, not from the Conversation, but only from the Charity of the Guests. That indeed is the only thing, that can season all our Mirth, that can sanctify all our freedom on such times: That indeed is the only true Christian life.</p>
            <p>I come in the Third place to examine, what ought to be the proper object of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians doing good. It must be done to all, but <hi>especially to the Houshold of Faith</hi>: which is the last particular in my Text.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:51114:12"/>'Tis manifest throughout the Bible, that besides the whole compass of Heaven, and Earth; in which God is pleas'd to reside, therefore calling <hi>the one his Throne,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 5.34, 35.</note> 
               <hi>the other his Foot-stool</hi>; though both are far from contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Immensity; but, besides that more ample Habitation of his Power, he has al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways condescended to take to himself, amongst the Sons of men, a peculiar <hi>Houshold</hi> of his Love: which, in all times, he has cherish'd as a Father, by his special Providence and Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection; and govern'd, as a Master, by a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Oeconomy of his own.</p>
            <p>This is the proper <hi>Houshold of Faith.</hi> And in the first Ages of the World, 'twas some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times literally no more than a single Hous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, or some few Families. Before the Fall of our first Parents, it could be no otherwise; and after it too 'twas so for several Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: whilest the Mysteries and Worship of the true Religion were almost confined to the Succession of one beloved Race, and the rest of Mankind left to be, what they had made themselves,<note place="margin">Eph. 2.12</note>
               <hi>Aliens and Strangers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor ought any to repine on this account, at the unsearchable Judgements of God, that so many were at once excluded out of his Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:51114:13"/>
Ought not all rather, we especially, to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire and adore his apparent Mercy, that any were still permitted to have a right in it; since none could merit, all had forfeited that right?</p>
            <p>But in process of time, when this chosen Family was multiplyed into a Nation, that Nation too became the <hi>Houshold of Faith</hi>; a greater, but still a Houshold: Limited in its Members, almost to one People; in its public Worship, almost to one House: But still a <hi>Houshold of Faith</hi>: a <hi>Faith,</hi> that was true, though obscure; a <hi>Faith,</hi> that had then the hope <hi>of things not seen,</hi> though it was not, as afterwards under the Gospel,<note place="margin">Heb. 11.1.</note> 
               <hi>the Evidence of such things.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Under the Gospel indeed the next, and the greatest increase of this <hi>Houshold of Faith</hi> has been made: when, by the Universal admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration of Grace, begun by our blessed Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, enlarged by his Apostles, carried on by their immediate Successors, and to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated by the rest to the Worlds end; all Types that darken'd this Faith, are enlighten'd; all Veils, that hid it, are rent, and taken away; all <hi>Walls of partition broken down</hi>;<note place="margin">Epis. 2.14.</note> all confine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to Families, or People, all narrowness of Opinions removed; all Nations under Heaven invited; some of all received into
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:51114:13"/>
this <hi>Houshold</hi>: which therefore has taken to it self, as it deserves, the most <hi>August</hi> Name of <hi>Catholic</hi>; that, without it, no other House, nor Religion, nor Empire could ever justly claim; nor within it, can any one Church above others rightly pretend to it, but only all together, united in the same Faith, the same Hope, the same Charity.</p>
            <p>Such have been the different extents of this <hi>Houshold of Faith,</hi> through all its successions. And what all along were the different ranks? what the distinct Offices? what degrees of Privilege, and Command maintain'd amongst all its members? None at all? Yes certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly very much of all. In so divine a <hi>Houshold,</hi> so united in one <hi>Faith,</hi> were there no other Means of Order, or Methods of Union? no Superiority of some? no submission of others? no reverence towards any? How could it then be a <hi>Houshold?</hi> A Herd of wild Beasts on the Mountains, a salvage Drove of men in Caves might be so order'd, or rather so dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order'd:<note place="margin">Eph. 3.15. Chap. 2.19. 1 Pet. 2.9. Tit. 2.14.</note> But never a <hi>Family,</hi> a <hi>City,</hi> a <hi>People, a peculiar People</hi>; all which the <hi>Houshold of Faith</hi> is often called: for to all these Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and Subordination, Government, and Subjection are most necessary for their well-being,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:51114:14"/>
for their being in a Civil State; certainly therefore as necessary to a Spiritual Family, and City, and People.</p>
            <p>Can there be any reason imaginable, why the <hi>Houshold</hi> of God alone should throw off all that Rule, and Discipline, that orderly De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence, and Duty, and Service, by which all other Houses in the world are best go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd? Nay by which they can only be well govern'd? No. So far is an indistincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all persons, or equality of all Orders, and, by consequence, an Anarchy of all things; so far from being agreeable to the Will of God; declared in the Beautiful, and Harmonious frame of his great Houshold, the World, and especially in all the Ministeries of proper Houshold, the Church; that there was never yet any time, since the Church was a considerable Number; I believe, since it was a Number; when some of its Members were not more Sacred than others, when some were not appointed Spiritual Rulers, some Temporal Governours, some both over others.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Patriarchs</hi> were indubitably invested with both these Authorities. In <hi>Moses,</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> they were divided in persons; but still united as in Brethren. In the <hi>Iewish State,</hi> of
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:51114:14"/>
which every part was of Gods own prescrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; 'tis needless to tell, how great was the Preeminence of the Priestly Office; how Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred their Degrees; how Separate; how Plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful their Maintenance.</p>
            <p>Or if that Example be not Spiritual, be not Christian enough: What can be more Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, more Spiritual, than our blessed Saviours making the like distinctions between his own Evangelical Ministers? His sending not all his Disciples equally, but first his Apostles, and them chiefly? and his impowering them to send others with the like differences? as is plain from their practice. And of those very Apostles (for I see not, why, as we pass, we may not plead our own cause too) of those A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles some, even the greatest, Married men; of their successors many Married Men: all en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with indelible power from above, to Feed, to Govern this Houshold; to Create, to continue a Succession in it; to Consecrate, to ordain Pastors, and Stewards of it, to the worlds end:<note place="margin">Luke 10.7.</note> all worthy of Livelyhood, some of Honour, and, if we will believe S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Paul,</hi> even in the times of greatest purity,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 5.17.</note> and simplicity, <hi>some worthy of double honour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We have now discover'd, what is the true
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:51114:15"/>
               <hi>Houshold of Faith</hi>: In general, the whole Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of the Faithful, divided in times, and places, joyn'd in one mystical <hi>Houshold</hi>: In a particular, more eminent manner, the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of that Houshold, the Dispensers of that Faith: and so many of the best Interpreters understand my Text.</p>
            <p>Hence therefore we behold to whom all Christians are to do good: to all Men; especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to all Christians; more especially to all the Ministers of Christ. And this being laid down, as undeniable, if you give me leave to make one short step farther, we may then by an easy, and necessary consequence, reduce this general advice to our present, particular purpose.</p>
            <p>For if the Fathers, and Husbands of those, whose relief this your Meeting intends, were unquestionably of the <hi>Houshold of Faith,</hi> both as the Members and Ministers of it; and if on that account all were especially to do good to them; then certainly their Relicts, and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren cannot be Strangers in this <hi>Houshold</hi>; ought not to be Strangers to the Good, that is done in it, if they want it. If to the Ministers of Christ, whilest Living, all are to do Good, as to the chief Officers <hi>of the Houshold of Faith;</hi>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:51114:15"/>
then certainly, when they have ceased from their labours, at least as much to their posteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; to whom there is near the same obligation, too frequently a far greater need, and occasion of doing good. And if all Christians are bound to do good, in a peculiar manner to the <hi>Hous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold of Faith,</hi> so understood; then no doubt those of the <hi>Houshold</hi> it self, who are in some estate of Prosperity, which, God be prais'd, is your case, have much stronger ties to do good to the other members of the same <hi>Houshold,</hi> who are in adversity.</p>
            <p>You now see, Reverend, and Beloved in our Lord and Saviour, the course of my Text has brought us to the great design of this our Assembly; which is mercy to those distressed persons, who have the same relation to this <hi>Houshold of Faith</hi> with our selves. But before I come to them, I beseech your patience, whilst I speak something to our selves here present: to whom, from what has been said, methinks a little seasonable Counsel, some honest, hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble intreaties at least, are due from me at this time; as from all of us a relief is due to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
            <p>We have heard our Common, our Proper Title to the <hi>Houshold</hi> of God laid open before
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:51114:16"/>
us. We find our selves inrolled in this heavenly Family, as Servants, as Sons, as Sons to the chief, and most Sacred part of this Family. The best Philologers say, that the Original word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>ã in non-Latin alphabet ã</desc>
               </gap>, which is here translated <hi>of the Houshold,</hi> does not only signifie Domestic, as oppos'd to Foreign, to those without doors; but also pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate, as oppos'd to common, and those that are only just within doors. On both these Senses our claim is founded. We are not only <hi>of the Houshold,</hi> out of which a great part of the World is excluded; but we are more privately, more intimately <hi>of the Houshold,</hi> in which a great part of the Faithful are only as common Members.</p>
            <p>Thus we have all a double relation to it: some of us a threefold: All of us as Christians; all as Sons of the Ministers of Christ: some not only so, but as Ministers our selves. And can our duty then be single? Is there nothing expected from us, more than from other Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians? Does our greater privelege require no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing from us, but what is Common? Yes certainly very much. Let me briefly put you in mind, what it is.</p>
            <p>First, since we claim a proper interest, above others, in the preeminent rights of the <hi>Hous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:51114:16"/>
of Faith,</hi> then, no doubt, to make good that claim, we are all proportionably oblig'd above others, to conform to the proper man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and virtues, that belong to, and become this <hi>Houshold,</hi> and distinguish it from all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: then, no doubt, if in every one of such Virtues, whether they respect God, or Man, we do not exceed others, we scarce do our ordinary duty: what great deficience is it, if we come short of others! what hainous shame, if we notoriously offend in the opposite sins!</p>
            <p>We have far greater obligations than all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to do good: we have not so much as the false excuses, that some others may think they have, to do evil. If we forsake the waies of Grace, and Goodness, we cannot allege any colour of Ignorance, or want of Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: we cannot say we have not learn'd them, or we could not: nay we cannot say, we have forgot them. They were familiar to us from our Cradles; imprinted on our Childish Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mories; insinuated into our tenderest Age; endear'd to us by the nearest Examples. Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue in us not only our Duty, but should be our Portion, our Inheritance. Vice in us were not only wickedness, but Apostasie, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate wickedness.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:51114:17"/>Wherefore of those Graces, which no Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian can be without, we ought to exhibit a greater measure: of those, which adorn a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Life, we should aspire to the most excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent degree. Far should be from us not only all scandalous evil, but all <hi>the least appearance of evil</hi>: and, as <hi>Caesar</hi> said of his House, not only the Sin, but the suspicion. The spotless mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desty of private, and public life, that sobriety of Conversation, that mildness of behaviour, that Innocence, that Benignity of words, and actions, that Liberal, that Generous Spirit which all other other Christians ought to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour after, should look in us, as if they were natural to us, and born with us. In those good things, which all others are to study, and imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate, we are to give, some of us Rules, all of us Examples. What all others should practice, we should scarce to know how to practice other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise.</p>
            <p>I urge this the rather, because we live in an Age, when there is an universal complaint, (and God knows, there is too much reason for it,) of an universal Corruption of good Manners. The complaint indeed is far more general, than the indeavours to redress it. Abroad every Man would be a Reformer, how very few at home?
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:51114:17"/>
But in truth, if all would really intend an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment, and set about it in good ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest; I cannot imagine any more likely means to effect it, than to have it seriously begun, and steddily carried on by men of our birth.</p>
            <p>Great and powerful; I am confident, irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistible would be the influence, which this ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Assembly would have on the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. <hi>If judgment begins at the house of God,</hi> says St. <hi>Peter,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Pet. 4.17.</note> 
               <hi>where shall the ungodly, and wicked appear?</hi> And why should we not expect that judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment will begin at the House of God, if re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation begins not there? But then let me add, if reformation begins at the Houshold of God, where shall ungodliness, and wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness appear? Your Examples will meet it at every turn; and put it out of countenance in every place: even in private corners 'twill soon lose that confidence, which now it too much assumes in public.</p>
            <p>Secondly, This consideration, that we are all united in one <hi>Houshold,</hi> are all of the more inward part of the same <hi>Houshold,</hi> may suggest to us all, that we especially of all Men, of all Christians, ought most to promote Unity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst our selves, and others.</p>
            <p>I beseech you mistake me not. I do not
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:51114:18"/>
only mean our Unity in matters of Religion. That amongst us, I suppose. I cannot reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably suspect, that any of us should be dissatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with, or disobedient to the Church of <hi>England.</hi> I cannot fancy that those little scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and groundless prejudices, and weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses of Conscience instead of tenderness, which mislead too many others, too many, otherwise good men; should find place in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of our minds, against so Pure, so Pious, so Regular, so Moderate a Church: at whose Breasts we were more than ordinarily nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish'd: a Church, which deserves to be to all a common Mother, and is to us so much more than a common Mother.</p>
            <p>Wherefore I will not, I need not undertake to exhort you to an Ecclesiastical Union within your selves. I am rather ready to congratu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late that to you. But there is another Unity, which, next that in Spiritual things, would be of all others most delightful to God himself, most advantageous to our Country: and that is your endeavour after a Civil, a Political Union in the whole Nation; a fair, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did Correspondence between all ways of life; a strict, and friendly Communion of good, and kind Offices, between Men of all Ranks, and Professions among us.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:51114:18"/>This is that, to which I would most ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly, and I believe I should most seasonably advise you all. You know who has said, <hi>That every Kingdom divided against it self is brought to desolation</hi>:<note place="margin">Mat. 12.25.</note> 
               <hi>and every City or, House divided a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst it self, shall not stand.</hi> And most cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly nothing more shakes the Superstructure, nothing more strikes at the Foundation of any Society of Men; nothing more disables a House, a City, a Kingdom, from doing good and great things, than mean divisions between the several Orders, and Conditions of its Members: their narrow-hearted repining at each others gain; their ill construction of each others advantages; their envying the fruits of each others labours: when one Trade, or Art, even those, that should be the most Liberal, shall make it their business to Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain, and Calumniate another; shall impute the faults of any particular men, to the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credit of any whole Calling: when any di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct way of life shall think, that all others injoy too much Profit, or Power, or Honour; they alone too little.</p>
            <p>What can be more destructive to public Quiet, and Concord? What to a private, easy, and honestly-pleasant life, than in full peace
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:51114:19"/>
to have, as it were, an open War between all professions? for any of the Clergy to murmur against the Priveleges of the Laity? for any of the Laity invidiously to aggravate the Rights, and Immunities of the Clergy? For Church-men to look with a greedy, or malicious eye, on the Incomes, or Preferments of Lawyers, or Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicians, or Merchants, or the Gentry, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out weighing their hazards, and expenses? For any of these, without regarding the pains, and burdens of Church-men, to grudge, or upbraid to them those small remains of Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Piety, which the Rapacity of some Ages has left, scarce left to the Church?</p>
            <p>Whether this be not, on all sides, a most ill-natured, most pernicious temper; whether it has not too much sower'd, and infected the humor of too many of our Countrymen; I leave to you to judge: yet not only to judge: but to you, of all men living, the cure of this Distemper is to be recommended. You are not only the most proper, but, I believe, the only instruments capable of effecting this hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py work. Unspeakable is the opportunity to this end, which is in your power, that no other generation of men can equally pretend to.</p>
            <p>'Tis an evident observation, than no other one
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:51114:19"/>
Race, not the Sons of any one other Professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, not perhaps all together, are so much scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd amongst all Professions, all ways of life, as the Sons of Clergy-men alone. Of most o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers the Children are commonly bred up in their Fathers way; or so plentifully provided for, that they are left at large; some few per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to venture on the Church. But with Churchmen 'tis far otherwise. Their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, we see, flow abroad, are confin'd to none, overspread all our ways of breeding; and life: our Shops, our Schools, our Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versities, our Inns of Court, our College of Physicians, our Towns, our Country, our Court, our Cities; this Court, this City espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially.</p>
            <p>And if the dispersion of the Church from <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem</hi> by the reason of persecution,<note place="margin">Acts 8.4.</note> first into all <hi>Iudea,</hi> then into all the World, became, by Gods wonderful providence, the chief cause of enlarging the Gospel: why may not we hope, that the Sons of the Church being so much di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spers'd, though, God be thanked, without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing driven, into all quarters of the Land, there was some extraordinary design of Divine Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in it? Certainly yes, certainly 'twas in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, that we should carry along with us
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:51114:20"/>
into all other places, and Professions, wherever our stations are allotted, some of those good, and virtuous qualities, which we were strange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly careless, if we did not bring from home with us: something of that meek, condescen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, calm, affable, reconciling, composed, composing Spirit; which if Churchmen, and their Progeny have not, they cannot pretend to any other Virtues.</p>
            <p>We were all born, and grew up in the very native soil of Modesty, Humility, Peace, and Unity. And if we shall neglect to propagate these blessed dispositions, in all the other soils, where so many of us are transplanted: what others can we expect shall do it? What others can undertake it, without some blemish to us? some reflexion on our negligence? But if we shall endeavour it with Diligence and Constancy, we need not doubt but, by the ordinary blessing of God, our labors in this kind will prove the fortunate means, to make these Virtues thrive elsewhere, spread every where.</p>
            <p>For proof of all I have said, concerning the probability, the certainty of reforming, and uniting the whole Nation by our Example; I crave leave only to set before you an image,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:51114:20"/>
of what would surely be done to this purpose, in this one City: which may well be reckon'd not only the seat of Trade, and Commerce, not only the Fountain of Habits, and Fashions, and good Breeding, but of morally-good, or bad manners to all <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Throughout the whole extent of this vast City, I know, there is no one Ward, no Parish; I believe, no Street, not many Lanes, where there does not live one or more, that have our Relation to the Church: and live generally in so good a rank, as will rather invite, than discourage others, to follow what they shall practise.</p>
            <p>Now then, if amongst you of our number, who are Citizens, there were at once begun, by common consent, an universal amendment of Life, and other Conversation: If we shall make it our unanimous business, to oppose the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Vices of the time, by their contrary Virtues; Schism by Unity; Hypocrisie by so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber Piety; Debauchery by Temperance; mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staken Zeal by true Zeal, and the like: if so, then the change will soon appear remarkable; the Example will be spreading; Favor, Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, Credit, Custome, and at last Number too will be on the side of Grace, and Goodness.
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:51114:21"/>
And (if you remember, how your City first rose out of its Ashes, after the dreadful fire, which, no doubt, you can never forget) as that was rebuilt, not presently by raising con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued Streets, in any one part; but at first here a House, and there a House; to which others by degrees were joyn'd; till at last sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle Houses were united into whole Streets, whole Streets into one beautiful City: So e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one of your Houses being first rais'd, and appearing eminent above others in Piety; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers will soon take Patern and Incouragement from your building: and so House by House, Street by Street, there will at last be finish'd, not only, as before, a great, and a magnificent City; but, what is far better, <hi>a City, that is at unity in it self</hi>;<note place="margin">Psal. 122.3.</note> a Modest, a Grave, a Religious City : And <hi>London</hi> will in short time as much excel it self in all manner of Virtue, as even now, I dare affirm, it excels any other City in the whole World, that comes any thing near it, either in largeness, or number of inhabitants.</p>
            <p>But lastly, since we are all of one Spiritual <hi>Houshold</hi>; and that not only in a Spiritual, but a Temporal Sense: what remains to be said, but that there ought to be maintain'd between all the members of this our <hi>Houshold,</hi>
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:51114:21"/>
a free, and uninterrupted Communication of our Spiritual, and our Temporal good things to each other? From the wealthy, and able part, their Temporal good things of Bounty, and Munificence to the Poor, and unable a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst us; from the poor and unable the return of their Spiritual good things, their Blessings, and Thanks, and Prayers; which cannot be a less good than they receive; nay they will be a far greater benefit to the wealthy, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, than these can bestow on them.</p>
            <p>I bless God, many of you here present are of the wealthy part; I see most of you are of the able; none, I hope, of the unable part. And it was my intention, to have tryed by an ample exhortation to excite your greatest ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour, and most fervent Zeal in this work. But I find, I have employed so much time, by the way, in other matters: that I cannot presume on your Patience much longer. Yet my comfort is, that such an Exhortation which the hour already spent would now make tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; the free, and tender Nature of my Hearers has made unnecessary. A much longer Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course my Argument requires: your merciful dispositions a much shorter. Wherefore seeing it will be far better, for you your selves to reason
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:51114:22"/>
with your selves on this subject, than for me, or any man else, to load you with persuasions: I shall forbear enlarging, and only offer to your thoughts some few heads of consideration.</p>
            <p>You are now; Fathers, and Brethren; <hi>Sons of the Prophets; and of the Covenant God made with your Fathers,</hi> you are now, with happy, and auspicious beginnings, forming a Model of Charity: of a most Christian, truly-Protestant Charity: than which nothing can more fix the Root, nothing more spread the Branches, more cherish the tenderest, and weakest branches of the Reformation: nothing more stop the mouths of those, who by forbidding Marriage to the Clergy, would introduce in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Catholic Church,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 4.1. <hi>So interpreted by Bishop</hi> San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derson. Serm. 5. ad Pop.</note> what St. <hi>Paul</hi> calls <hi>the Doctrine of Devils.</hi> To confute these men there were Arguments enough before, drawn from Religion, Scripture, and Antiquity. One Political Argument they seem'd to have, and boasted of it, as unconfutable; That from such Marriages would inevitably ensue Pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in many of the Children, and thence a Disgrace, and Burden to the whole Church. But, by this design, you have opposed their false Policy, with true, and great Wisdom: what they boaded would be a mischief to us;
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:51114:22"/>
you are providing shall be one of our prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal strengths: you have consulted not only the strength, but the fame of the best Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Church: and are freeing it, not only from the scandal of its Enemies, but even from its own greatest defect, and inconvenience.</p>
            <p>The opportunity, that is now put into your hands for this purpose, is peculiar, and extraordinary: not only of this one day, or of other such days, which, I trust, will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways succeed this once a year; but the sure, and solid Foundation of a perpetual Corpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: by which, under a Reign of the greatest Mercy, and Clemency that ever the Sun beheld, you are Authorized to make this good work of Mercy a great one; call'd upon, many of you by name, to do it, by Royal Authority; to which a constant obedience, and most dutiful observance has been ever the proper, unsullied Honour of your Church, and of your Extraction.</p>
            <p>The Persons to be reliev'd by you, so nearly approach you all, in the strictest degrees, though not often perhaps of Kindred, nor always of private Friendship; yet always of Birth, and interest: that their support may not only be call'd bounty in you, but the most Father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:51114:23"/>
or Brotherly tenderness, and even some kind of self-love. From you their sad estate may well expect effectual comfort, since there are none, though never so much strangers to them, from whom it may not deserve com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miseration. They were left destitute, some of Education, all of a subsistance suitable to their former life; without any the least fault of their own; without any possibility of their preventing it; either by the narrow Provisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their Husbands, or Parents enjoy'd, in their best condition: or by the unavoidable fate of their untimely deaths: or no doubt some of them, by their frank hearts, and their open hands, and their Charity towards others, whilst they lived: or, which ought to be mention'd for their greater honour, by their Fidelity to the Crown, and sufferings for the Church.</p>
            <p>On these accounts, all innocent, some praise-worthy, some honourable, they were expos'd to hardship, and penury; to which they had never been used, and which, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out you, they could never have escaped. Nor was their Poverty all. That their Religion would have taught them to endure. But what was far more grievous, and deplorable, their
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:51114:23"/>
Poverty had expos'd them to be a cause of scorn and derision, an objection against Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it self.</p>
            <p>An objection, which now we shall happily see removed. For you, who have undertaken their relief, some of you by Gods blessing on your labours, some on your Studies, some by Gods, and the Churches blessing on your E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states, all of you by some blessing, or other, are abundantly furnish'd with power; and I know, with affections to; contribute your share to this work. So that though it should be true, as I fear it is, that never any time since the Reformation can shew so many poor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the Widows, and Orphans of Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, as this particular time: yet I believe it to be as true, and we all ought to rejoice at it, that God, in his Mercy, has now more than ever, provided, and pointed out a proportion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able supply for them, within our selves. As more Clergy-men were impoverish'd by the calamities of the late War, and Oppression of the Church and State, than ever in the like space before: so, I think, it may be said without Envy, I am sure, if this work proceeds, it may, that more Clergy-men, or their Heirs, than ever in one time before, since they were allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:51114:24"/>
Marriage, have been brought to a plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and prosperous condition by his Majesties, and with him the Churches, most happy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storation.</p>
            <p>What any of you, or your Fathers then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, was never a just objection against you, because you only received what was just, and your own: nay it has been, and will be for ever, not only no objection, but for your praise, and honour; that of what you then gather'd, as most lawfully your own, you have since already dispos'd so very much, in works of public Piety and Charity; and are still ready to scatter much more on this occasion, for the good of others.</p>
            <p>Scatter much, do I say? There is no abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute need of that. For towards your effectual carrying on of this design, nothing but what may easily consist with your Plenty, your Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperity; nothing that shall be any way bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>densome is requested of you: only what you can readily spare; from your necessities, your occasions? No, but even from your pleasures, your superfluities; only that which to give away will be a kindness to your selves, as well as to others.</p>
            <p>'Tis not the weight of Bounty, and good
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:51114:24"/>
Works from a few, so much as the number from so many, that is expected to make up and continue this heap. We have visible In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances in this City, where great, and well-nigh incredible effects are yearly accomplish'd towards maintaining the poor of almost all Trades, and Callings, only by a constant mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, and setled succession of small contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions wisely administred.</p>
            <p>And I hope it will never be said, that the Laity, who by the Clergy are taught to be charitable, shall in their Corporations, exceed the Clergy it self, and their Sons, in freeness of giving. But if any shall think, that in the practical prudence of managing such gifts, the Laity may have some advantage over the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy; whose experience is, and ought to be less of this World than the others: That in your Corporation is most wisely supplied. As there are Churchmen enough in this pious Foundation, most able to advise the good Works; so there are Laymen enough most a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to direct their Uses.</p>
            <p>To our Laity, and Clergy both, my Dear Friends, this Institution will turn to inestima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble advantage; without giving the least rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to suspect, that any other course of former
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:51114:25"/>
Charity will be dryed up or, diverted; but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther all of them will be much increas'd, and more filled by opening this new Fountain. Such is the nature of all true Charity: the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of it towards any always enlarges Mens desires to practise it towards more: Indeed as a Fountain it flows; always flowing, when once begun: the several parts of it not hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring, but either making way for, or pushing on each other.</p>
            <p>Yet though it be certain, that no other way of public Charity has any just ground to be jealous of this; I cannot but add, that as to public benefit, this will be inferiour to none, preferable to most others, if not to all: For by this means, not only many helpless persons will be provided for, whilst they live; but a Generation of Men will be bred up, within our selves, not depending on any other Patrons, not perverted by any other hopes: and whose principle, whose judgement, whose interest it will be to obey, and support our own Church and State, which cherishes a Married Clergy; to oppose a Foreign Church, that condemns it; but whose ill practices, for want of it, are one of the greatest justifications of such mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="45" facs="tcp:51114:25"/>In the Athenian State,<note place="margin">

               </note> which was the great Fountain of Learning, and Virtue to the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then World, one of noblest excitements to honourable actions was, that the Children of those, who had died serving their Country, were bred up at the Public charge, till they came to the age of manhood: and were then brought forth to the people, clad all in Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, one of their public Ministers proclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before them; That hitherto, in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of their Fathers Merits, the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth had educated these young men, and now dismiss'd them so arm'd, to go forth, and thank their Country, by imitating their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Examples.</p>
            <p>Methinks I may promise, and even foretell, that in your future Processions on these days, we shall see such a Train of Youth, by you so bred up, and prepar'd for the service of Church, and State; to whom it may be said: Thus far the memory of your Fathers deserts has maintain'd you: Now go forth in a lucky hour: Try to follow their Paterns of Loyalty to the King, and Zeal for the Public Interest: Try to return to your Benefactors, that kind of Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, which of all others, will be most ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to them: by endeavouring to put
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:51114:26"/>
your selves into a condition of doing the good to others, that has been done to you: by endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring the Peace, and Welfare of a Church, to which you owe, not only your spiritual, but your natural life.</p>
            <p>A Church, that excels all its Enemies, on both sides, as in many other things; so espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in the great Doctrine of Charity: In which the Papists, on the one side, pretend to be most triumphant: and I heartily wish, too many of the Sectaries, on the other side, were not apparently too deficient. But our Church has most wisely, most piously chosen, and the blessed Spirit of God has most graciously assisted it in the choice of, the midle path between both these extreams. It gives as much due to Good Works, as is consistent with the Grace of the Gospel; It gives as much preference to Divine Grace, as is consistent with the Precepts of the Gospel; Commands us to return to God, and, as to him, to the Poor, his Gifts, out of meer duty and thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness; not to deposite them with him, in hopes of meriting by them; requires us to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form all deeds of Charity equally to any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>others, but not with equally presumptuous pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tensions.</p>
