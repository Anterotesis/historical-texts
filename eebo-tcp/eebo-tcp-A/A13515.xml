         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>For a lamentable example of the Diuels malice, and mans

not to be matched, a fellow not be fellowed, &amp; one that scarce

            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:24008:3"/>This <hi>Iohn Rowse</hi> being a Fishmonger in <hi>London,</hi> gaue ouer
his trade, and liued altogether in the Towne of <hi>Ewell,</hi> neere
<hi>Nonesuch,</hi> in the County of <hi>Surry,</hi> ten miles from <hi>London,</hi>
where he had Land of his owne for himselfe and his heires for
euer to the value of fifty pounds a yeere, with which hee liued
in good and honest fashion, being well reputed of all his
neighbours, and in good estimation with Gentlemen and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
that dwelt in the adioyning Villages.</p>
            <p>Vntill at the last he married a very honest and comely wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
with whom hee liued quietly and in good fashion some
six moneths, till the Diuell sent an instrument of his, to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbe
their Matrimoniall happinesse: for they wanting a
Maidseruant, did entertain into their house a Wench, whose
name was <hi>Iane Bl<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ndell,</hi> who in short time was better acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with her Masters bed then honesty required, which in
time was found out and knowne by her Mistris, and brake the
peace, in such sort, betweene the said <hi>Rowse</hi> and his Wife, that
in the end, after two yeeres continuance, it brake the poore
womans heart, that she dyed &amp; left her Husband a widdower,
where he and his Whore were the more free to vse their cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
contentments, and vngodly embracements.</p>
            <p>Yet that estate of being vnmarried was displeasing to him,
so that he tooke to wife another woman, who for her outward
feature, and inward qualities was euery way fit for a very ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
man, although it were her hard fortune to match other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise.</p>
            <p>With this last Wife of his he liued much discontented, by
reason of his keeping his lewd Tr<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ll in his house, so that by
his dayly Ryot, excessiue drinking, &amp; vnproportionable spen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
his estate began to be much impouerished, much of his
Land morgag'd and forfeited, himselfe aboue two hundred
pounds indebted, and in processe of time to be (as a lewd
<pb facs="tcp:24008:3"/>
liuer) of all his honest neighbours reiected and contemned.</p>
            <p>His estate and credit being almost past recouerie wasted
and impaired, he forsooke his Wife, came vp to <hi>London</hi> with
his Wench, where hee fell in new league with a corrupted
friend; who (as he said) did most courteously coozen him of
all that euer he had, &amp; whom at this time I forbeare to name;
because it was <hi>Iohn Rowse</hi> his request before his execution, that
he should not be named in any Booke or Ballad, but yet vpon
a Dye his name may be picked out betwixt a sinke &amp; a trey.
This false friend of his (as he said) did perswade him to leaue
his Wife for altogether, and did lodge and boord him and
his paramore certaine weekes in his house, and afterward
caused him and her to be lodged (hauing chang'd his name)
as Man and Wife in an honest mans house neere Bishops<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate,
at <hi>Beuis Marks,</hi> where they continued so long, till his
money was gone, (as indeede he neuer had much, but now
and then small petty summes from his secret friend aforesaid)
and he being fearefull to bee smoak'd out by his Creditors,
was counselled to leaue his Country, and depart for <hi>Ireland;</hi>
and before his going ouer-Sea, his friend wrought so, that all
his Land was made ouer in trust to him, and Bonds, Coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants,
and Leases made, as fully bought and sold for a summe
of two hundred and threescore pounds; of all which money
the said <hi>Rowse</hi> did take the Sacrament and his death, that hee
neuer did receiue one penny, but hee said that now and then
he had fiue or ten shillings at a time from his said friend, and
neuer aboue twenty shillings, and that all that euer he had of
him, being summ'd together, was not aboue three &amp; twenty
pounds, the which moneys his friend did pay himselfe out of
his Rents. But some more friend to him, then he was to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
did doubt that he was cheated of his Land: whereupon
(to make all sure) he said that his false friend did so farre pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile
<pb facs="tcp:24008:4"/>
with him, that hee the said <hi>Rowse</hi> tooke an Oath in the
open Court at Westminster Hall, that hee had lawfully sold
his Land, and had receiued the summe abouesaid, in full sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
and paiment, and his said friend did vow and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
many times vnto him, with such oathes and vehement
curses, that he neuer would deceiue his trust, but that at any
time when hee would command all those forged Bonds and
Leases, that hee would surrender them vnto him, and that
hee should neuer be damnifide by them or him, to the value
of one halfe-penny. Vpon which protestations (hee said) he
was enticed to vndoe himselfe out of all his earthly possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
&amp; by a false oath to make hazard of his inheritance in
Heauen.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Ireland</hi> he stayd not long, but came ouer againe, and
was by his friend perswaded to goe into the Low Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries:
which he did, neuer minding his Wife and two small
Children which he had by her, hauing likewise a brace of ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stards
by his Whore (as some say) but he said that but one of
them was of his begetting. But he, after some stay in <hi>Holland,</hi>
saw that he could not fadge there, according to his desire,
and withall, suspecting that he was cheated of his Land, and
aboue all, much perplexed in his Conscience for the false
oath that he had taken, pondering his miserable estate, and
ruing his vnkindnesse to his Wife, and vnnaturall dealing to
his Children, thinking with himselfe what course were best to
take to helpe himselfe out of so many miseries which did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compasse
him, he came ouer againe into <hi>England</hi> to his too
deare friend, demanding of him his Bonds and Leas<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s of his
Land which hee had put him in trust withall. But then his
friend did manifest himselfe what he was, and told him plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that he had no writings, not any Land of his, but what hee
had dearely bought and paid for. All which (<hi>Rowse</hi> replyed
<pb facs="tcp:24008:4"/>
vnto him) was false, as his owne Conscience knew. Then
said the other, haue I not heere in my custody your hand
and Seale to confirme my lawfull possession of your Land?
and moreouer haue I not a Record of an Oath in open
Court, which you tooke concerning the truth of all our bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine?
And seeing that I haue all these especiall points of
the Law, as an Oath, Indentures, and a sure possession, take
what course you will, for I am resolued to hold vvhat I
haue.</p>
            <p>These (or the like) words, in effect passed betwixt <hi>Rowse</hi>
and his Friend (Trusty <hi>Roger</hi>) which entring at his eares,
pierced his heart like Daggers; and beeing out of money
and Credit, a man much infamous for his bad life, indeb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
beyond all possible meanes of paiment; a periured
wretch to coozen himselfe, hauing no place or meanes to
feede or lodge, and fearefull of being arrested, hauing so
much abused his Wife, and so little regarded his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
being now brought to the pits brim of desperation,
not knowing amongst these calamities which way to turne
himselfe, hee resolued at last to goe home to <hi>Ewell</hi> againe
to his much wronged Wife, for his last refuge in extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie.</p>
            <p>The poore Woman receiued him with ioy, and his
Children with all gladnesse welcomed home the prodigall
Father, with whom he remained in much discontentment
and perplexitie of minde: the Diuell still tempting him

               </gap>oluing that hee had beene a

of good Reputation and Calling, that hee had Friends,
Lands, Money, Apparell, and Credit, with meanes suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
<pb facs="tcp:24008:5"/>
to haue left for the maintenance of his Family, and
that now he had nothing left him but pouerty and begge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
and that his two Children were like to be left to go from
doore to doore for their liuing.</p>
            <p>Being thus tormented and tost with restlesse imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
hee seeing dayly to his further griefe, the poore case
of his children, and fearing that worse would befall them
hereafter, hee resolued to worke some meanes to take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
their languishing liues, by a speedy &amp; vntimely death,
the which practise of his (by the Diuels instigation and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance)
he effected as followeth.</p>
            <p>To bee sure that no body should stop or preuent his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uellish
enterprise; hee sent his Wife to <hi>London</hi> in a friuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
errand, for a riding Coate: and she being gone some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
timely, and too soone in the morning, both her Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
being in bed and fast asleepe, beeing two very pretty
Girles, one of the age of sixe yeeres, and the other foure
yeeres old, none being in the house but themselues, their
vnfortunate Father, and his ghostly Counsellor, the dores
being fast locked, hee hauing an excellent Spring of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

               <pb facs="tcp:24008:5"/>Which first Act of this his inhumane Tragedy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ended, hee carried the dead corps vp three payre of
stayres, and laying it downe on the floore, left it, and went
down into the Chamber where his other Daughter, named
<hi>Marry,</hi> was in bed; being newly awaked, and seeing her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
demanded of him where her Sister was? To whom he
made answer that he would bring her where she was. So ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
her in his armes, hee carried her downe towards the
Seller: and as hee was on the Seller stayres, shee asked him
what he would doe, and whither he would carry her? Feare
nothing, my Child (quoth hee) I will bring thee vp againe
presently: and being come to the Spring, as before hee had
done with the other, so hee performed his last vnfatherly
deed vpon her, &amp; to be as good as his word, carried her vp
the stayres &amp; laid her by her sister; that done, he laid them
out, and couered them both with a sheete, walking vp and
downe his house, weeping and lamenting his owne misery,
and his friends treachery, that was the maine ground of all
his misfortunes, &amp; the death of his Children: and though
there was time and opportunity enough for him to flye, &amp;
to seeke for safety; yet the burthen and guilt of his consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
was so heauy to him, and his desperate case was so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme,
that hee neuer offered to depart; but as a man wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of his life, would, and did stay, till such time as hee was
apprehended and sent to Prison, where he lay till he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded
with a iust deserued death.</p>
            <p>What his other intents were, after hee had drowned his
Children, is vncertaine; for hee drew his sword and
laid it naked on a Table, and after, he gate a poore woman
downe into the Seller, and in the same place where the two
Infants lost their liues, hee did helpe the woman to wring
a Bucke of his clothes, and then he requested her to help to
<pb facs="tcp:24008:6"/>
conuey his goods out of his house; for hee said that hee
feared that the Sheriffe of Surry would come and seaze vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
all. But the woman not thinking of any of the harme
that was done, imagined that he had meant that his goods
would be seazed for debt, and not for murther.</p>
            <p>But to returne to the miserable Mother of the murde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
Children, shee said that her heart throbbed all day,
as fore-boading some heauy mischance to come: and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
done her businesse that shee came about to <hi>London,</hi>
as soone as shee came home, she asked for her Children,
to whom her Husband answered that they were at a
neighbours house in the Towne. Then said she, I will goe
thither to fetch them home. No quoth he, I will goe my
selfe presently for them. The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> said his wife, let the poore wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
that is heere goe and bring them home. But at last she
saw such delay was vsed, she was going her selfe; then her
Husband told her that hee had sent them to a Kinsmans of
his at a Village called <hi>Sutton,</hi> foure miles from <hi>Ewell,</hi> and
that hee had prouided well for them, and prayd<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> her to bee
contented and feare nothing, for they were well. These
double tales of his, made her to doubt somwhat was amisse:
therefore shee intreated him for Gods sake to tell her true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
where they were. Wherevpon he said, If you will needs
know where they are, goe but vp the staires into such a
Chamber, and there you shall finde them. But in what a
lamentable perplexity of mind the poore woman was when
shee perceiued how and which way they lost their liues,
any Christian that hath an heart of flesh may imagine.
Presently the Constable was sent for, who tooke him into
his custody, who amongst other talke, demanded of him
why and how hee could commit so vnnaturall a fact, as to
murder his Children? To whom he answered, that he did it,
<pb facs="tcp:24008:6"/>
because he was not able to keepe them, and that hee was
loth they should goe about the Towne a begging: and
moreouer, that they were his owne, and being so, that hee
might doe what hee would with them, and that they had
their liues from him, and therefore he had taken their liues
from them, and was contented to lose his life for them: for
he was sure that their miseries were past, and for his part,
he had an assured hope to goe to them, though they could
not come to him.</p>
            <p>So being had before a Iustice, his Examination was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
briefe; for he confest all the whole circumstances of the
matter freely; so that he was sent to the common Prison of
<hi>Surry,</hi> cal'd the <hi>White Lyon,</hi> where hee remained fourteene
or fifteene weekes a wonderfull penitent Prisoner, neuer, or
very seldome, being without a Bible or some other good
booke meditating vpon; and whon any one did but menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his Children, he would fetch a deep sigh, and weepe, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siring
euery one to pray for him and vpon his owne earnest
request, he was praide for at <hi>Pauls</hi> Crosse, and at most of the
Churches in <hi>London,</hi> and at many in the Country, and at
the Sessions holden at <hi>Croydon,</hi> the latter end of <hi>Iune</hi> last, he
made such free confession at the Barre, declaring the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of his life, his odious Drinking, his abominable Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
his cruell Murther, and the false dealing of his deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
friend, which was the cause of his finall wracke: with
which Relations of his pronounced, with such vehemency
and protestations, he moued all that heard him to commi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seration
and pitie.</p>
            <p>So, according to Law and Iustice, he was there condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
and iudged (for the murthering of his two Children)
to be hang'd; which Iudgement was executed on him at
the common Gallowes at <hi>Croydon,</hi> on Munday the second
<pb facs="tcp:24008:7"/>
day of <hi>Iune,</hi> 1621. where he dyed with great penitency and
remorce of Conscience.</p>
            <p>This was the lamentable end of <hi>Iohn Rowse,</hi> a man of the
age of fifty yeeres, and one that might haue liu'd and dyed
in better fashion, if he had laid hold on the grace of heauen,
and craued Gods protection and fatherly assistance: but of
all that herein is declared, this one thing which I now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare,
is most lamentable &amp; remarkable; which is, that <hi>Ewell</hi>
being a Market Towne, not much aboue ten miles from
<hi>London,</hi> in a Christian Kingdome, and such a Kingdome,
where the all-sauing Word of the euer-liuing God is most
diligently, sincerely, and plentifully preached; &amp; yet amidst
this diligence, as it were in the Circle or Center of this sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity,
and in the floud of this plenty, the Towne of <hi>Ewell</hi>
hath neither Preacher nor Pastor: for although the Parso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage
be able to maintaine a sufficient Preacher, yet the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
beeing in a Lay-mans hand, is rented out to another
for a great sum, &amp; yet no Preacher maintained there. Now
the chief Landlord out of his portion, doth allow but seuen
pounds yeerely for a Reader, and the other that doth hyre
the Parsonage at a great Rent, doth giue the said Reader
foure pound the yeere more out of his meanes and courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie:
and by this meanes the Towne is serued with a poore
old man that is halfe blinde, and by reason of his age can
scarcely read: for all the world knowes, that so small a sti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
cannot finde a good Preacher Bookes, and very hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
bread to liue on; so that the poore soules dwelling there,
are in danger of famishing, for want of a good Preacher to
breake the Bread of Life vnto them: for a Sermon amongst
them, is as rare as warm weather in <hi>December,</hi> or Ice in <hi>Iuly:</hi>
both which I haue seene in <hi>England,</hi> though but seldome.</p>
            <p>And as the Wolfe is most bold with the Sheepe, when
<pb facs="tcp:24008:7"/>
there is either no Shepheard, or an impotent insufficient
one, so the Diuell (perhaps) tooke his aduantage of this
wretched man, seeing he was so badly guarded, &amp; so weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
guided to withstand his force and malice: for where
God is least known and called vpon, there Satan hath most
power and domination. But howsoeuer, I wish with all my
heart, that that Towne and many more were better proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
then they are, and then such numbers of soules would
not be in hazzard to perish; nor so many sufficient schollers
that can preach and teach well, liue in penury through want
of maintenance. I could runne further vpon this point, but
that I doe shortly purpose to touch it more to the quick in
another Booke.</p>
            <p>By this mans fall, we may see an example of Gods Iustice
against Drunkennes, Whoredome, and Murder; the Diuel
being the first Author, who was a Murtherer from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning:
who fil'd <hi>Cain</hi> with Enuy, that hee murdered his
brother <hi>Abel:</hi> who tempted <hi>Dauid</hi> first to Adultery, and
afterwards to Murther; who prouoked <hi>Herod</hi> to cause the
blessed Seruant of God <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> to lose his head, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
hee told him it was not lawfull for him to marry his
brother <hi>Philips</hi> Wife; and who was the prouoker of the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foresaid
<hi>Herod</hi> to murther all the innocent male children in
his Kingdome. And let vs but marke and consider the
plagues and punishments that God hath inflicted vpon
Murderers, Adulterers, and Incestuous persons: First, <hi>Cain,</hi>
although by his birth hee was the first man that euer was
borne, a Prince by his birth, and heire apparant to all the
world; yet for the Murther by him committed on his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
he was the first Vagabond and Runnagate on the face
of the earth, almost fearefull of his owne shaddow: and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
he had liued along time terrifide in Conscience, was
<pb facs="tcp:24008:8"/>
himselfe slaine (as is supposed) by <hi>Lamech. Simeon</hi> and <hi>Leu<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </hi>
the sonnes of <hi>Iacob</hi> were accurst of their Father for the
slaughter of the <hi>Sichemites; Ioab</hi> the Captaine of <hi>Dauids</hi>
Host, was slaine for the murthering of <hi>Abner; Dauid</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
for the death of <hi>Vrias,</hi> and the Adultery committed
with <hi>Bethsheba,</hi> was continually plagued and vexed with the
Sword of Warre, with the Rebellion of his owne sonnes,
and with the vntimely deaths of <hi>Amnon,</hi> and <hi>Abs<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

<hi>Saul,</hi> they were both by <hi>Dauids</hi> commandement put to
death, who had both their hands and feete cut off, &amp; were
afterward hanged ouer the Poole in <hi>Hebron: Samuel</hi> 2. 4.
The examples are infinite out of diuine and humane Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stories,
that God did neuer suffer Murder to goe vnrewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded:
and this miserable man, of whom I haue heere rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
is a most manifest spectacle of Gods reuenging venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
for that crying and hainous sinne.</p>
            <p>As concerning Lust and Incontinency, it is a short plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
bought with long paine, a hunnied poyson, a Gul<gap reason="illegible" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap> of
Shame, a Pickpurse, a breeder of Diseases, a gall to the
Conscience, a corrosiue to the heart, turning mans wit in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
foolish madnesse, the bodies bane, and the soules perdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
it is excessiue in youth, and odious in age; besides,
God himselfe doth denounce most fearefull threats against
Fornicators and Adulterers, as the Apostle saith, that
Whoremongers and Adulterers shall not inherit the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of Heauen, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 9. And God himselfe saith, that
he will be a swift witnes against Adulterers, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3. 5. And
the Wise man saith, <hi>that because of the whorish woman, a man
is brought to a morsell of bread, and a woman will hunt for the
precious life of a man:</hi> For, saith he, <hi>can a man take fire in his
bosome, and his cloathes not bee burnt? or can a man goe vpon
<pb facs="tcp:24008:8"/>
hot Coales, and his feete not be burnt? So hee that goeth in to his
neighbours Wife, shall not be innocent, Prou. 6. 27, 28, 29. Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melech,</hi>
one of the sonnes of <hi>Gedeon,</hi> murdered threescore
and ten of his Brethren; and in reward thereof (by the iust
Iudgement of God) a woman with a piece of a Milstone
beate out his braines, after hee had vsurped the Kingdome
three yeeres, <hi>Iudges</hi> the 9. Our English Chronicles make
mention, that <hi>Roger Mortimer,</hi> Lord Baron of <hi>Wallingford,</hi>
murdered his Master King <hi>Edward</hi> the second, and caused
the Kings Vncle, <hi>Edmund</hi> Earle of <hi>Kent,</hi> causelessely to bee
beheaded: but Gods Iustice ouertooke him at last, so that
for the said Murders hee was shamefully executed. <hi>Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrey</hi>
Duke of <hi>Glocester</hi> was murdered in the Abbey of <hi>Bury</hi>
by <hi>William de la Poole</hi> Duke of Suffolke, who afterward was
beheaded himselfe on the Sea by a Pyrat. <hi>Arden</hi> of <hi>Feuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sham,</hi>
and <hi>Page</hi> of <hi>Plimmouth,</hi> both their Murders are fresh
in memory, and the fearefull ends of their Wiues and their
Ayders in those bloudy actions will neuer bee forgotten.</p>
            <p>It is too manifestly knowne, what a number of Stepmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
and Strumpets haue most inhumanely murdred their
Children, and for the same haue most deseruedly been exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted.
But in the memory of man (nor scarcely in any Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story)
it is not to be found, that a Father did euer take two
Innocent Children out of their beds, and with weeping
teares of pittilesse pitie, and vnmercifull mercy, to drowne
them, shewing such compassionate cruelty, and sorrowfull
sighing remorcelesse remorce in that most vnfatherly and
vnnaturall deede.</p>
            <p>All which may be attributed to the malice of the Diuell,
whose will and endeuour is that none should be saued, who
layes out his traps and snares, intangling some with Lust,
some with Couetousnesse, some with Ambition, Drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
<pb facs="tcp:24008:9"/>
Enuy, Murder, Sloth, or any Vice whereto hee sees
a man or a woman inclined most vnto, as hee did by this
wretched man, lulling him, as it were, in the cradle of sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suality,
and vngodly delight, vntill such time as all his
meanes, Reputation, and Credit was gone, and nothing left
him but misery and reproach. Then hee leades him along
through doubts and feares, to haue no hope in Gods Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence,
perswading his Conscience that his sinnes were
vnpardonable, and his Estate and Credit vnrecouerable.</p>
            <p>VVith these suggestions, he led him on to despaire, and
in desperation to kill his Children, and make shipwracke of
his owne Soule, in which the diligence of the Diuel appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth,
that he labours and trauels vncessantly: and as Saint
<hi>Bernard</hi> saith, in the last day shall rise in condemnation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
vs, because he hath euer been more diligent to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy
