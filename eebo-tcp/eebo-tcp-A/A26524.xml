            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THE Dedicating of Books to Noblemen, is either Ambition in the Author, to adorn the Front of his Work with Illustrious Titles; or a counterfeit beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging their Patronage and Protection; or else an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment of Favours received from them. I am
<pb facs="tcp:45842:3"/>
not guilty of the first, nor have I flattered my self with the second, but I have made use of the last, to express in some measure, a sence of the many Obligations I have to you. I confess I have been quarrelling with my Studies, that they have not afforded me something of more value than a Translation, as a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to my Friend, who is so great a Master of Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals; yet this Anthology of Fables, for the Pains I have taken, in gathering and new modelling them, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with my Notes and
<pb facs="tcp:45842:3"/>
Observations on them, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving a Title somewhat above that, cannot, I hope, be thought improper to be submitted to your Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. I intended them for the benefit of such as have not the Skill to search for them in their several Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages, from whence I fetch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them. The representing of which pleasant Ideas, to the Readers Fancy, being like the placing of Pictures be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their Eyes, whereby more firm and lasting Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions of Vertue may be fix'd in them, than by plain
<pb facs="tcp:45842:4"/>
Rules and Maxims. This was <hi>Horace</hi>'s Opinion, who in his Art of Poetry, says,
<q>
                  <l>Segnius irritant Animos demissa per Aurem,</l>
                  <l>Quam quae sunt Oculis subjecta fidelibus.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>I have also been very careful that the Subjects of my Fables should be modest, grave, and accommodated to the best Precepts of Vertue and Wisdom; wherein I have exploded all manner of indecencies, too imprudent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb facs="tcp:45842:4"/>
used by <hi>I. Poggius</hi> the <hi>Florentine,</hi> and some others; that so they might be more proper for Instruction of Youth, whose minds are commonly delighted with such Fancies as these. And, in a plain Stile have I dres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed this Work, to their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage particularly, whose Parents either cannot or will not, be at the Charge of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving them bred to Learning, but will leave all to the strength of Nature, as their only School-Mistress. For these Seeds of Virtue natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally sown in them, will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate,
<pb facs="tcp:45842:5"/>
unless by some wholesome Precepts, stirred up, and made to exert their latent Qualities. Thus the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous Vine, if not timely pruned and dressed, becomes Wild and Unfruitful.</p>
            <p>Now as certain Medicines are used, as well for keeping Men in Health, as for Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Sick; so, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite and preserve Vertue, as well as to cure the Diseases of the Mind, good and sound Precepts of Morality are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite, which are always esteemed its properest Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caments. 'Tis the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg
<pb facs="tcp:45842:5"/>
and Practice of this Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality, which makes our Lives happy; by whose Rules, Violence and Oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion are separated from Justice and Equity: They show clearly the difference betwixt what is Vertuous, and what Vitious: with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which Distinction, as <hi>Iso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi> says, there could be no Society amongst Men. These are the sober Guides, which call back Fools from going astray, and even admonish and secure the Wise in the right Paths. Wherefore the <hi>Greeks</hi> very Significantly
<pb facs="tcp:45842:6"/>
called such Instructions <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, because they settle our Thoughts, and consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute our Understandings. Youths raised to this pitch are preferred to others, being pronounced by <hi>Plato,</hi> to be qualified for the good of Mankind, as having their minds adorned with such useful Knowledg, <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>.</p>
            <p>But I shall fall into the same Error with him, who read a Lecture of War to <hi>Hannibal</hi>; since no Man knows the Genius of Youth better than your self;
<pb facs="tcp:45842:6"/>
under whose Vigilant Care, Prudent Discipline, and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Culture, so many Noble Plants have been already, and others are now raising, for the Service and Glory of their Country. Your Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, Sedulous Reading, and quickness in all manner of Learning, have justly ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred you, in the Opinion of the best Judges, the most Compleat Master for Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Youth, in this our Age. Your School for its easie Methods, for the large Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirements there to be had, and for its Regularity, may
<pb facs="tcp:45842:7"/>
more properly be termed a Colledge; where you keep up to a Wonder the Forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of a Master, without the Pedantry; and have happily joyned the Gentleman, with the Scholar; by which you become a proper Governour, for the Sons of the most Eminent Families of this Kingdom. Amongst whom you dispence your Precepts, so full of Truth, Wisdom and Honour, that the being within your Walls, should be an Incitement to the worst of Tempers, to be in Love with Vertue and Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
<pb facs="tcp:45842:7"/>
Your Employment, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on as it is, ought to be as Honourable as it is Labori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and import its Rewards, as it exports its Cares.

            <head>The Preface.</head>
            <p>SOme Antient Philosophers have written, that every one of us partake of two different Natures or Qualities; the one of a Man, and the other of a Beast. The first of these is ever enclining us to Vertue and Honourable Actions: and the latter alluring us to things more Brutish, and unbecoming Humanity. Therefore, have the Poets feigned that <hi>Achilles,</hi> and many other Princes were commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to <hi>Chiron</hi> the Centaur, to be brought up under his admirable Discipline; who being half a Man and half a Beast, and having a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
<pb facs="tcp:45842:8"/>
understanding of both these Natures, might instruct them by Wise Precepts, to make their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Advantages of the one, and avoid the continual Allurements of the other. And tho' this Centaurs Methods of Instruction, were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably by Fables or Hieroglyfics, as was much of the Learning of those Antient Times; and his shape so very preposterous; yet his Scholars, of which number were <hi>Apollo</hi> and <hi>Aesculapius,</hi> had a due respect both to his Person and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, as even <hi>Achilles</hi> himself had, which <hi>Iuvenal</hi> thus hints in his Seventh Satyr.
<q>
                  <l>— Metuens virgae, jam grandis Achilles</l>
                  <l>Cantabat patrijs in Montibus: Et cui non tunc</l>
                  <l>
                     <pb facs="tcp:45842:9"/>Eliceret risum Citharaedi cauda Magistri?</l>
               </q>
Let none therefore dispise my two Principal Authors, <hi>Aesop</hi> for his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formitity, or the <hi>Thracian Phaedrus</hi> for his Barbarous Country, nor yet for their obscure Births; or meanness of their Conditions, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving both been Slaves: Neither let any think that these Fables were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented only for the pleasing of Children, as some weak and Indis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet Persons have fancied; since he that reads them with a Prudent Consideration, will find not only very useful Precepts of Morality, but also many of the most admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable notions of Philosophy, and solid Maxims of Policy contained herein. For who can imagine that our incomparable Philosopher <hi>Aesop</hi>

should have undertaken any thing, that was not Excellent and Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, seeing the Gods concerned themselves in the Vindication of his Vertue; and that the Divine Justice doomed those to an Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minious Death who conspired to take away his Life.</p>
            <p>But methinks there should need no great matter of Argument to gain a Credit to this our Mytho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy, which has been approved by the most Learned Men of past Ages, reverenced by all Nations, and esteemed even by Soveraign Monarchs. Such will therefore but betray their own Ignorance, as shall condemn these Pleasant Apologues, alledging that they rather become the Mouths of mean Persons<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Women and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, than Men of eminent Parts,
<pb facs="tcp:45842:10"/>
and such as bear any considerable Office in a Common-wealth; whereas 'tis evident that the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est States-men of all Nations, in their most supream Councils, as well as on divers other Occasions, have made frequent use of them. Do we not read that <hi>Demosthenes</hi> found no better means to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the Obstinacy of the <hi>Atheni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> than by entertaining them with a Pleasant Fable: The Divine <hi>Plato</hi> has inserted them amongst his Laws, as excellent Flowers. The Ancient Poets have enriched their Works with them, and have dextrously used them to make the Barbarous People receive with more delight, the Sacred Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of their Theology. <hi>Mennenius Agrippa,</hi> with a Fable, pacified the Mutineers against the <hi>Roman</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:45842:10"/>
Senate. And <hi>Phalaris</hi> of <hi>Agrigentum,</hi> tho' a fierce Tyrant, had been chosen by the <hi>Himerenses</hi> for Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral of their Army, if the Poet <hi>Stesichorus,</hi> by the Fable of the Horse and the Stag, had not affrighted them from it.</p>
            <p>Kings themselves have not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained to speak in this Language. <hi>Cyrus</hi> the Great refused, for some time, to grant the Ambassadors of the <hi>Ionians</hi> and <hi>Aeolians,</hi> the Pardon they were sent to sue for, after their ill success, when forced to truckle to him, whose Govern<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ment they had formerly rejected; the King answering them with the Fable of the Fisher, who expected to have made the Fishes Dance ashore, out of the Water, to the sound of his Pipe. And <hi>Theobaldus,</hi> King of <hi>Austracia,</hi> now <hi>Lorrain,</hi> as
<pb facs="tcp:45842:11"/>
               <hi>Gregorius Turonensis</hi> relates, intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to punish an Officer, who had enriched himself by Extortion, and unlawful Exactions on the People, assisted himself with the same Prudence. A Serpent, said he, slipping into a Vessel of Wine, so filled his Body with that sweet Liquor, that he could not possibly get out again at the Hole through which he entred, until he had first emptied himself of all the Wine he had drank. Nor did that great Man <hi>Iulius Caesar,</hi> less honour Fables; for when the Inhabitants of <hi>Cuidus</hi> had Revolted from his Party, to side with <hi>Pompey,</hi> he pardoned them, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for the sake of <hi>Theopompus</hi> the Orator and Historian, who had industriously made and Published a Collection of choice Fables.</p>
            <p>But what would some Ignorant People say, should I tell them of the
<pb facs="tcp:45842:11"/>
Thistle, that sent Ambassadors to the Cedar which was in <hi>Lebanon,</hi> saying, Give thy Daughter in Marriage to my Son; and that to punish this Arrogance of the Thistle, a Wild Beast of the Forrest coming thither, trod it down and destroyed it. Or should I relate what passed among the Trees, when they assembled together for choosing a King to rule over them; yet these are both taken out of the Holy Scriptures. And was not the Prophet <hi>Nathan</hi> sent from God to King <hi>David,</hi> after his Adultery with <hi>Bathsheba,</hi> and Murder of her Husband <hi>Vriah,</hi> to make this good King sensible of the double Crime he had committed; giving him this Relation? That there was a Rich man, the Master of many Flocks and Herds, and a Poor man who had but one Ewe
<pb facs="tcp:45842:12"/>
Lamb, which he loved and bred up with his Children, feeding it at his own Table, and cherishing it as his Child; and that when a Travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler came to the Rich mans House, he spared his own Flocks, and took the Poor mans Lamb out of his Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som, which he killed and dressed to feast the stranger. These were My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterious Words dictated by the Ho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly Ghost, which touched, and wounded the Heart of that incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable Monarch, opening a way to his Repentance.</p>
            <p>And our Blessed Saviour <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> whilst he was here on Earth, conversing among men, did he not also express himself in Parables? Which were no other than Fables, prudently invented, for convincing a stubborn, and unbelieving People. <hi>And without a Parable spake he not.</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:45842:12"/>
In one place he makes mention of a Grain of Mustard-seed, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very small, grew up higher than the tallest Trees. And in another, he tells of a man that sowed his seed upon a Rock, where the Birds of the Air came and eat it up. Now these things being full of Mysteries, and <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> being the Truth it self, we must believe that Fables, which he thought convenient to make use of, were the proper Characters of Truth; and that it could no way be more nobly, and more profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly represented, than by them. And St. <hi>August.</hi> says, <hi>Falsa illa quidpiam significantia, ac sensum absconditum involventia, ea non esse Mendacia sed Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guras Veritatis, quibus sapientissimi, &amp; Sanctissimi quique usi sunt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But if some unsatisfied Person, to justify his ill Opinion of Fables<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <pb facs="tcp:45842:13"/>
should think he had sufficient reason to slight and disesteem them for the meanness of their subjects: I shall answer, that a man would be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted but very weak, that should have a Fancy to cut down a Tree, only because its body was crooked, without having any regard to the excellent Fruit which it might bear in its proper Season. Nor would any but a very unskilful man throw a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way an unpolished Diamond, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause its splendour and sparkling Beauty was hid under the roughness and deformity of an ordinary Stone. So Fables though they may seem ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous for their introducing Beasts, Birds, and Trees talking together, yet are they to be highly valued for the Learning and profitable In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction they contain within them.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Arabians,</hi> as the Learned
<pb facs="tcp:45842:13"/>
               <hi>Huetius</hi> affirms, in his Book <hi>De Origine Fabulaerum Romanesium,</hi> were so great Lovers of Fables that their Prophet <hi>Mahomet</hi> has filled his <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coran</hi> with them; And as he boasted himself to be the Messenger of God, who speaks to men in Parables, he would there seem to imitate Him. These <hi>Arabians</hi> Translated <hi>Aesop's</hi> Fables into their own Language; by whose Pattern they also compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed divers others. And that <hi>Locman</hi> so famous over all the Eastern Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, is by many supposed to be no other than <hi>Aesop,</hi> whose Fables these People collected into one large Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume; adding many of their own to them, and they valued themselves very much, upon their knowledg of them; because in one Chapter, which for that reason is inscribed to the name of <hi>Locman,</hi> the <hi>Alcoran</hi> does
<pb facs="tcp:45842:14"/>
highly extol his Wisdom. The Lives of all the Patriarchs, Prophets, and Apostles of this Nation, are full of such Fables. And they have amongst them a certain Sect of Philosophers, who, that they may lay down their Precepts to the Capacity of the Common People, do them under the familiar way of Fables.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Persians</hi> were not at all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind-hand with the <hi>Arabians,</hi> in this pleasant Art of lying, altho' none more detest a lye in their Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Conversation than they, nor more reproved their Children for it. Yet 'tis a wonder to think how much they were pleased with a Lye (if such Inventions or Figments may be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led so) in their Books of Morality, and for the Propagation of their Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Witness the Fabulous Exploits of their great Law-giver <hi>Zoroaster</hi>; and <hi>Aesops</hi> Fables were so delightful to
<pb facs="tcp:45842:14"/>
their Pallats, that they boasted, the Author of them was their Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. Now he being the same Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son with <hi>Locman,</hi> in the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> so much reverenced by all the People of the East, they endeavoured to take from <hi>Phrygia</hi> the Honour of his having been Born there; and establish it among themselves. And whereas <hi>some Arabians</hi> would make his Descent to have been from the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> the <hi>Persians</hi> deny it, and affirm him rather an <hi>Aethiopian,</hi> which the Etymology of his Name seems to confirm, but that he lived at <hi>Cassuvium,</hi> which City many sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose to have been the ancient <hi>Arsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia</hi> in <hi>Media.</hi> Hence some Criticks in History, when they compared <hi>Locmans</hi> Life, written by <hi>Mircondus,</hi> with <hi>Aesops,</hi> done by <hi>Maximus Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nudes,</hi> find them to have a great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblance. For as the Angels be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow
<pb facs="tcp:45842:15"/>
Wisdom on <hi>Locman</hi> in his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor <hi>Marcondus,</hi> so do these Criticks observe <hi>Mercury</hi> to impart Fable to <hi>Aesop,</hi> in his Authors <hi>Philostratus</hi> and <hi>Planudes.</hi> Which brought into their minds that the <hi>Greeks</hi> might have taken this <hi>Locman</hi> from the Eastern Nations, and so from him feigned (as I may say) their <hi>Aesop.</hi> But I shall leave this Controversie, knowing the <hi>Grecians,</hi> as well as the Eastern Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, are too much addicted to mix Inventions with their History and Chronology. Yet to the first is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed the greatest credit of Faith and Industry. For the likeness which the <hi>Locman</hi> of <hi>Mircondus</hi>; has with the <hi>Aesop</hi> of <hi>Planudes</hi> and <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stratus,</hi> does not any more make <hi>Loc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> to be <hi>Aesop,</hi> than <hi>Aesop</hi> to be <hi>Locman</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Persians</hi> honoured <hi>Locman</hi> with the Sirname of Wise, and so is <hi>Aesop</hi> always ranked in the number
<pb facs="tcp:45842:15"/>
of the Wise. They report of him, that he found out the most abstruse Secrets of Physick, and had such pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found skill therein, that he could e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven raise men from the Dead. His Fables were so illustrated and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged with such Variety of Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions, that the <hi>Arabians</hi> made out of them that great Volume, which is now to be seen at <hi>Rome</hi> in the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tican Library. His fame was spread abroad overall <hi>Aegypt</hi> and <hi>Aethiopia,</hi> where his Name and Learning was had in so great Veneration, that many have supposed him to have been born there. Nor do the <hi>Turks</hi> less honour him at this Day.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mircondus</hi> and the <hi>Arabians</hi> make him to have lived in the Reign of King <hi>David,</hi> so that if this be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed the true <hi>Aesop,</hi> and any credit be given to the <hi>Greek</hi> Chronologers, those Eastern Writers have mistaken
<pb facs="tcp:45842:16"/>
no less than four hundred and fifty years, which is no unusual thing with them. But by this computation the Character of <hi>Locman</hi> might more properly agree with <hi>Hesiod,</hi> who flourished in <hi>Solomons</hi> time; and who, as <hi>Quintilian</hi> and <hi>Plutarch</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, was the first that might boast he laid down the Designs of those Fables, whose Inventions were attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to <hi>Aesop.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Name of <hi>Locman</hi> for his admirable book of Fables, is so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned, that it has reached even into <hi>India,</hi> where he is celebrated in their Songs, and by them said to be the brother of <hi>Ram,</hi> or <hi>Ramus,</hi> their excellent Law-giver, whom they adore as a Deity. Which <hi>Ram</hi> is reported to have been a very Holy Person, a great Warrior, and a most powerful King, reigning in the Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern parts of <hi>India.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:45842:16"/>The <hi>Americans</hi> also are said to be great Lovers of Fables, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward those who can relate them; being much delighted to hear of Dogs, Horses, and other Creatures, talking together.</p>
            <p>But I shall forbear, at present, any further discourse of <hi>Aesop,</hi> intending speedily to publish his Life at large, with another Volume of Fables, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready prepared for the Press, if these answer my Booksellers expectation. Yet I must acquaint my Reader, that these run not according to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon method of the <hi>Greek</hi> or <hi>Latin</hi> Fables used in Schools; for being a mixture of divers Authors, which I englished out of several Languages, I have Polished, and Methodized them to my own fancy, calling them <hi>Aesopian,</hi> from the Resemblance the rest have to his. Not that <hi>Aesop</hi> (as some have imagined) was the
<pb facs="tcp:45842:17"/>
first Inventor of these Apologues or Moral Fables, for <hi>Homer, Hesiod</hi> and <hi>Archilochus</hi> were before him, but he as <hi>Aphthonius</hi> says of him, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. has writ the best Fables. Hence <hi>Quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilian</hi> observes, That those Fables commonly reported to be <hi>Aesops</hi> though they were not all really his, for <hi>Hesiod</hi> seems to have been the Author of many of them (as I have before hinted) yet were they chiefly Celebrated under <hi>Aesops</hi> name. But I shall conclude my long Preface with what <hi>Phaedrus</hi> says of his work in his Prologue to it. <hi>Duplex Libelli dos est; Quod risum movet, &amp; quod Prudenti vitam consilio monet.</hi> That there is a double gift or advantage in this Book, It both excites Laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and gives wholsom Instructions for the Prudent Government of our Lives.</p>

art thou? Had a Jeweller, who knew thy value, been so happy to find thee, he would have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyced, for thou mightest have made him rich: But since thou art of no Benefit to me, I despise thee, and should rather have found a Grain of Barly, than all the Sparkling Gemms of the World.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By this Precious Stone may be meant Wisdom and Arts, and by the Dunghil Cock an Ignorant man, who has no Love for Knowledge, because he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstands not its Value. Again, The Cock may also signifie the Covetous and the Luxurious man, both which spend their Lives scratching amongst the Dirt of the World: The former in a search after Riches, the latter in satisfying his Brutish Lusts: And tho they have opportunities of acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Wisdom, are yet of so depraved a Nature, that they had rather gratifie their sordid Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites, than be possessors of that inestimable Iewel. But 'tis probable the Author of this Fable might more particularly allude to those who scorn this kind of Learning, which in former Ages has been held in great esteem. Such men know not the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue of these Precious Gemms, but raking in the Dunghil of unprofitable Books, had rather find some piece of Filthy Debauchery, than suck the Honey out of these fragrant Flowers. <hi>Optima saepè despecta:</hi> The best things are commonly despised.</p>

The Spring came, but he was then employed to fetch in Earth for making Bricks and Tiles. This made him cry out, O ye Gods! would the Summer were here, that my Master being busie at his Harvest, I might have time to get a little Rest. When it was Summer, they made the poor Beast

<pb n="13" facs="tcp:45842:23"/>
the saying true. For at some distance, being so happy to espy you pearched on this Tree, I came hither, out of Curiosity, to satisfy my self concerning a malicious Calumny I have often heard thrown on you; which is, that you were blacker than Pitch, and now I here find, that you may vye with the very Snow for Whiteness. Truly you excel, in my Judgment, the Swan in the purity of your Colour, and were you but as admirable at your Singing, as you are renowned for your Auguries, and ennobled by your Milky plumes, your Vertues and Merits might justly claim a Soveraignty over all other Birds. The Crow thought he had spoken in earnest, and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to show the excellency of her Voice, let fall the Cheese out of her Mouth; which the Fox quickly snatched up, not without a hearty fit of Laughter, and eat it in her sight: Whilst the vain-glorious Bird was both troubled, and ashamed she had listened to that gross Flattery, whereby she lost so valuable a prey.</p>

               </head>
               <p>WHen in a great concourse of Beasts it was argued, what should be the reason, they should all be so easily brought to slavery and oppression by Man, whose strength was so much inferiour to theirs, and yet they were taken and disposed of at his pleasure? The Fox told them, It was his opinion that the Wisdom and Reason of Man was so great and admirable, that no strength was capable to resist it. This set the Bear into a rage: Nay, said he, 'tis rather our Cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardice that ruines us, and our voluntary Tame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Submission that gives them the Mastery over us: For, to say nothing of the Horse, whose strength and vigour is sufficiently known, is not the Elephant a most valiant Creature, and yet he is rid by Men, and obeys them, nor does he in any respect refuse their Dominion over him. But if we would resolve to fight it out with them, as we too often do foolishly amongst our selves, and would rather choose to lose our Lives by their cunning Tricks, than basely submit to our Enemies, or let any Commerce be between them and us, we might by these means reasonably think to preserve our Liberty. When the Bear had roared out these words he held his tongue, expecting their Resolution herein<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but after a general murmuring, the Assembly broke up and dispersed. Not long after, this very Bear hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening into a Toil, was caught, had Rings put
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:45842:31"/>
into his Nose, and suffered himself to be led about by Men; He was taught to Dance, and perform the usual tricks done by tame Bears, and all this with a steddy patience, and without grumbling.</p>

                  <hi>This shows that Men change their Manners with their Fortunes.

At the strangers approach, after divers Questions, he asked them, What the World said of him and his Subjects, and what they thought
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:45842:33"/>
of his Greatness. The Flatterer speaking first, told him, That the World rang of his Magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence and Power, but that he found Fame was short in all her relations concerning him: being now sensible he was a mighty Emperour. And when demanded, What he thought of those about him? He answered, That by their noble appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, he presumed they were his great Lords, valiant Captains, and prudent Magistrates, suta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Attendants on so potent a Monarch. The Prince of the Apes hearing himself thus highly extolled, generously rewarded him for this gross Flattery. All which being observed by the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous man, If this Lyar, said he to himself, who has no bounds to his Tongue, be thus beloved, honoured, and rewarded; how much more shall I, that in all things love to tell the plain truth! While he was in this thought, the Chief Ape asked him, And what thinkest thou of me and these about me? He who was accustomed to speak truth, and ever hated Flattery, Thou, said he, art but an Ape, and so all these about thee are but a company of Apes, Baboons, and Monkeys, nor does the World esteem ye otherwise. The Prince of the Apes hearing this, in a great Passion commanded his Guards to take away this upright vertuous man, and tear him in pieces with their Teeth and Nails, which was immediately put in execution.</p>

swept off again. And the Gout, happening into a Poor mans Cottage, was also miserably en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained with a hard Bed, Course Sheets, mean Diet, and even a scarcity of that too. Which Inconveniences, next Morning when the two Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Travellers meeting, had well consider'd, they resolved to try their Fortunes another way. So that coming at Night to a City; the Gout en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into the House of a Rich Magistrate, where she was quickly entertained, with Honourable Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, Down Beds, and Soft Couches to lye on, Variety also of the best Meats and choicest Wines; nor was there any Pleasure she could wish for, which she enjoy'd not. Whilst the Spider in a Poor mans House, weaved all the Gins, Snares and Nets, which she could contrive necessary for the catching her Game; without any Interruption; and there she lived in great Quietness and Plenty, free from the fear of Brush or Broom. When they had spent some time in this Felicity; the two Friends met again, and after mutual Salutations, they enquired of each others good Fortunes, where both extolling their Admirable Success since their last parting; they made a Resolution that from thenceforward, which way soever they should happen to Travel, the Gout by consent, should turn into the Rich and Noble mens Palaces, and the Spider into the Cottages of Poor men.</p>

So after great Threats on both sides, how much they would spend rather than lose their Rights, they applyed themselves to the Lawyers; and then the War was soon declared. But e're their Advocates began to plead, one of the Clients considering with himself, called his Adversary aside, and whispering in his Ear, 'Tis not at all, said he, for our Credits, that we, who are by Nature so straightly bound to each other, should by Money be divided, and made Enemies. Pray consider that the Event of Law is as uncertain as that of War: 'Tis in our power to begin it, but not to bring it to an end. Our whole difference is about a hundred Staters of Gold, and if we proceed on in our Suit, we may spend double the summ before we shall have concluded it, amongst our Advocates, Solicitors and Clerks, also in procuring the assistance of Friends and Witnesses. All these must be waited on, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plemented, and fee'd; Besides we must be conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually trotting about with innumerable Cares and Vexations attending us. And then at last, he
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:45842:41"/>
who shall get the Victory, let him sit down and make the best Reckoning he can, he shall find himself a Loser. Is it not therefore better we should open our Eyes in time, before we put our selves into the Clutches of these Vultures? And that we should divide the Money that would fall to their shares, who will never thank us for it? Resolve therefore to quit half your pretensions, and I will do the like; Thus shall we both be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, and preserve our Friendship, which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise would soon expire, and thus shall we shift off an unspeakable Trouble from us both. Which proposal if you still refuse to accept, I will leave the whole matter to your own Conscience; use me as you please; for I had rather my Friend should have my Money, than these unsatiable Harpyes; and shall gain enough in saving my Credit, keeping my Friend, and avoiding all the Troubles and Vexations dependant on such a Law-suit. The Truth of the thing, together with the Frankness of his Kinsman, so much took with the Adversary; that they soon put an end to the Difference by themselves; To the great dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure of all their Lawyers, who were heartily vex'd to lose so good a Prey.</p>

               <p>IN those times when Trees could speak, came a Countryman into a Wood, desiring liberty of the Trees to let him make a Handle or Helve amongst them, for a new Instrument he had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented, called a Hatchet; which the Wood courteously granted. But the Man having com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated his Hatchet, first began to cut with it the Boughs and Shrubs, and then to hew down tall Trees. But when they perceived this Destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on come upon them by their own free leave, they all were troubled. This, said an old Oak to the rest, is but a just punishment fallen upon us, who by our rash and inconsiderate Gift to Man, have pull'd this Mischief on our own selves.</p>

               <p>TO escape the close pursuit of the Hunters, a Hart hid himself under the thick Branches of a spreading Vine, where he lay lurking till the Hunters were passed by; and so soon as he thought himself secure, he began to eat the Vine Leaves, with which making a rustling noise, it raised in the Hunters a Curiosity of searching what it might be; imagining it some Wild Beast hid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

               <p>AFter a long War between the Wolves and Sheep, they made a Solemn Truce for a Term of years, and gave Hostages on both sides for the keeping it inviolable. The Wolves sent their Young ones on their parts, and the Sheep, in exchange, delivered into their Custody their

Dogs, who were to remain with them till the Expiration of the Truce. But the young Wolves being separated from their Damms, began to howl and cry, which the old Wolves hearing, took thereupon an occasion most perfidiously to break the Truce, yet pretending the Sheep were the Aggressors by their ill usage of the Hostages in their hands, and then falling on the innocent Sheep, committed all manner of Hostilities and Depreda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions amongst them.

               <p>A Wolf almost famished after a three days fasting, met in his progress up and down the Woods a Fox, whom seeing so fat and sleek, he admired, asking him how in such terrible wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, being the depth of Winter, he could find such plenty of Food to keep him in so good plight. The Fox pointing towards an Apes Cave, Thither, said he, am I often invited, and there always welcom, when I fail of good success in
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:45842:44"/>
my hunting for Prey. And saying this, he offered the Wolf some Fragments of his Meat brought from thence, which the Wolf soon devoured; but they only serving to whet his Appetite, in order to a better Meal, he begged the Fox of all Loves, to tell him by what means he might insinuate himself in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the favour of this Ape? That, answered the Fox, requires no great Art to do, if you can but frame your self to Lying. He thinking this no difficult matter, ran eagerly to the Den, where he was no sooner entred, but his Nose being Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted with a very unsavory smell. O insuffera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, cryed he, What a stinking place is this? And looking forward, he saw the Old Ape fondly hugging her deformed Young. Here forgetting the Crafty Foxes advise, Well, said he aloud, in all my life time did I never behold such ugly Creatures as these. And as he was going nearer to them, they all at the same moment leaping violently on him, with great fury tore him; one hanging on his Nose, another on his Neck, the rest on all sides Persecuting him, that the wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Wolf with much difficulty got clear of them, and escaped with Life. At his return he found the Fox, to whom he gave a full account of his reception. I do not wonder at it, said the Fox, because you speak truth at your very going in, when I so straightly charged you to lye. Do you not think I have the Senses of Smelling and Seeing, as well as your self? And yet I told her at my first visit, that I was infinitely pleased with that comfortable Odour, and sate me down, as if in some room made sweet with delightful Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fumes. Then called her Beautiful Lady, Mother

Till <hi>Iupiter</hi> tired with their
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:45842:46"/>
importunity, cast down amongst them a Beam of an extraordinary bigness; the fall whereof into the Lake, struch such a terror amongst the Frogs, as caused them to make their first approaches with Fear and Trembling; but seeing him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue mild and peaceable, they made, with more assurance, their next Addresses towards him, paying him all due Honour, at a less distance. At last, when they found it to be only a Log, they threw aside all manner of respect, leap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon it, and made their King their sport and scorn. This caused the Frogs to renew their Prayers to <hi>Iupiter,</hi> to send them a Valiant and Active King: He to answer their desire, gave them a Stork, who with great Majesty walking about the Lake, soon curbed the unquiet Spirits of those his unsatisfied Subjects; which obliged them pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately to complain to <hi>Mercury,</hi> beseeching him to implore on their behalves, the favour of <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter,</hi> in this their distress, but he would not hearken to them. Under this Tyranny therefore have they ever since groaned, for <hi>Iupiter</hi> would never grant them any redress, which constrains them to keep up in their holes all day, seldom stirring out till evening, that the Stork takes Wing to fly to his Nest, and then they appear abroad with hoarse Voices, renewing their old Complaint <gap reason="foreign">

Then give me leave to tell you, proceeded the Fox, and pray be not angry with me; He that is of your temper, and under your Circumstances, was born, no doubt, with the Curse of the Gods on his Head.</p>

<pb n="73" facs="tcp:45842:53"/>
planted, with my Root deep in the ground, whilst thou sprouting out of the Mud, there stickest with thy feeble Body, obliged to bow with every blast of Wind, nay, with every breath of Air; and then for all this presumption, thy haughty Head is made to stoop and kiss the Dirt. The proud Oak boasting on this manner, put to silence the Modest Reed, who had no mind to prosecute this imprudent Quarrel, but waited a fitter op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to upbraid him. When straight a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Storm arose, making great Destruction wherever it came, which the sturdy Oak brave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly resisted a great while, but was at last forced to give way, and was torn up by the Roots; while the humble Reed by its submissive yielding endured the whole fury of the Storm. And af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards would often laugh at the great Insolence of his Presumptuous Adversary.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Wise and Vertuous men should establish such an equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity in their Souls, as not to suffer themselves to be torn up by any Storm of Adversity, when by a small yielding they may be able to endure the shock.

But by the Allego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of our Fable, we are advised to bow and yield every way to what we cannot certainly oppose. When</hi> Phocion <hi>councelled the</hi> Athenians <hi>not to resist</hi> Alexander, <hi>but give place, for the present, to the violent Torrent of his Conquests, he could not justly be blamed for want of Valour or Manly Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution.

must thus bend and suit himself to the occasion, like the Reed, by which he shall continue his Root firm and durable, when the Storms shall blow; whilst the proud stubborn Oak that refuses to be plyant, shall be torn up, and his place no longer known.

The Old Man protested he had never seen him before, and that he had not given him any notice of it. When I kill'd, said Death, your Companions, nay so many Young Persons, and Children, and that you felt your strength and vigour fail you, then was your Summons, then should you have fixed your Thoughts on me, and then made a fit Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration of all things, and kept them so in order till my coming.</p>

               <figure/>
               <p>THE Wolves on pretence of settling a Peace with the Sheep had a Conference with them, wherein they urged this cunning Discourse to them. That both You and We, said they, may for the future make our Lives Happy, we come to propose a means of living peaceably and ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cably together, without any of our accustomed Fears and Jealousies one of another. To this
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:45842:57"/>
end let us make a solemn League betwixt us, which that it may be kept firm, and by no private Injuries violated, it will be necessary that you take off, or banish from amongst you, those Wicked Dogs, the Incendiaries that are always troubling our Peace, and embroiling us in Mischief. For they create in you a Jealousie of us, that we cannot walk civilly by your Folds, but they are sallying out to molest us, by which rough usage they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke us, when, alas, we never intended it, to give you disturbance, meerly out of revenge to their affronts: So that we would fain know what need you have of these Pernicious Creatures, the sole cause of all our Misunderstandings. By this plausible Harangue the poor Sheep, full of Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity, being easily deluded, put away in all haste their Dogs, with great Disgrace, from amongst them, admitting the Wolves in their stead, and then being destitute of all Succour, they were soon miserably devoured by their merciless Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>This cautions us not to give credit to the deluding words of our Enemies, nor to yield up our Guards into their Hands.

               <p>AS a very Rich, but Covetous Man, lay at the point of Death, he ordered all his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney-Bags to be brought before him, and made this Discourse to them: O my Ungrateful Money! said he, with what intollerable pains have I scra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped you up together, and yet you have never given me any Pleasure, but rather a continual Vexation, Fear, and Melancholly. What can you do for me now at this last Exigency? Can you prolong my days beyond their appointed date? Or can you purchase me a good Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence when I shall appear in the other World, to render an account of all the Actions of my Life? No, answered the Money, we are able to do you no good in these respects, but we can give you the satisfaction to assure you, that your Heir shall soon consume us all, in Whoring, Drinking and Gaming; and that for our sake, your Soul shall go to the place of Everlasting Torment.</p>

               <p>A Stag that bore chiefest sway in a large For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest, had the pleasure, without incurring any danger, to see a brace of Grey-hounds course a Hare over a spacious Field; where one of the Dogs leaping eagerly through certain brambles broke his Leg. Now this Stag being of a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Spirit, seeing the Hare safe, (for the other Grey-hound wanting assistance had quitted her)
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:45842:58"/>
came out of his stand, or sheltring place, and made it a scruple of Conscience to suffer a Creature to perish, that had shown so much briskness in the Chase; out of meer compassion therefore, he offered to carry this Cripple to the next Village. The Greyhound was jealous at first, and would glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have excused the Complement, but convinced by the kind Expressions of the Stag of his sinceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, who stooped down to give him the advantage of getting on his back, the Greyhound was taken up, and by him carried towards the Town. As they were thus on their way, they related to each other their several Adventures; and the Stag was just saying, how happy he and his Brethren should be, if the Hounds would not maliciously hunt them by the scent, and make continual War against them. At which moment, they were overtaken by a Fox, who listening, had heard some of their Discourse, and Smiling, told the Stag, It was very strange, he was not sensible that he carried his greatest Enemy on his back. I have no Enemies, answered the Stag, but the Hounds, and this is a Greyhound, a Creature of another Species, whom I carry. Both Hounds and Greyhounds, replyed the Fox, are at open Hostility with all your Race: And I can assure you, that if your life were in his Power, as his is now in yours, you would find no mercy from him. The Stag then began to be angry, and would have thrown him off his back, but remembring he had given him his promise: 'Tis no matter, said he, though his Companions should be so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful to attack me, after doing him so good an office, I'll acquit my self as well as I can of

                  <hi>That a Wounded Man came running into a Ladies House, and up into her Bed-Chamber, begging her protect on from his Enemies; she pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised it, hid him in her Closet, and had no soon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er dressed his Wounds, but saw certain Officers rushing into the House to look for him. These had her free leave to search for him every where, but in her Closet where he lay; and after these, she saw her own Son brought in dead of three mortal Wounds, given him by the Person she had so careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly concealed. Then alas! did two violent Passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons struggle within her Breast, but at last Pity overcame her Revenge, so she went and threw her self upon the Dead Body of her Son, bathing it with her Tears; and after the Searchers were gone, she ran to the Assassin, Go Bloody Murderer

of my Son! cryed she; be gone thou Cruel Wretch! that hast robbed me of what was most dear to me in this World. Make haste from my House, since I have given thee my Word for this time, but when I shall have discharged my self of my Trust, and put thee in safety, take care I never see thee more, for if I do, I am resolved to revenge this thy Cruelty, with the greatest rigour of Iustice. When she had said this, she caused him to be secret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conveyed away in safety, by one of the most trusty of her Servants, without letting any of the rest of her Family know it.</hi>

But I have long since, said his Companion, settled that matter. And being demanded how? I shall ever, replyed he, faithfully and diligently proceed on in those Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods wherein I have always been hitherto bred up, and leave the Event to God, to dispose of all things as he shall best please. The Grave Man hearing this, told him with a scornful smile, He had known many, who relying on God, had found themselves at last short of their expectations. And then falling upon the Subject of his Doubts, and of the Incertainty of the things of this World, began to have a Dreadful Apprehension of his being

Blind; when with a sudden kind of Horrour, O Immortal Gods! cry'd he, what would become of me, should I lose my Sense of Seeing? In which Imagination, he had a mind to try how he could be able to go, in case of such a Calamity: And advancing a little before his Companion, he shut his Eyes very close, walking on blindfold, but with great caution, for fear of stumbling; thus going he happened to miss the sight of a Purse of Money, lost by some Person Travelling that way, which was soon espyed, and taken up by his Comrade following him, who passed the rest of his Journy more pleasantly than till that time he had done.</p>

               <p>AN Ape meeting a Fox, and observing him to be in good plight, having a plump Body, and his Coat lying smooth and sleeck, Ah! How much more bountiful, said she, has Nature been to thee, than to me, for she seems to have mademe, as it were, in spight, with a kind of exquisite Deformity. The Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Fox willing to convince her of her Errour, invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted her to walk on a while with him. I'll wait on you, answered the Ape, tho I confess I am ashamed to be seen on the Road, thus ragged, lean, and half naked as I am, with you, who are so hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som and well clad. They had not gone far, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they met an Elephant that had lost his Teeth; of whom the Fox enquired, what force was able to break Teeth of that mighty strength, which his, by the roots seemed to have been? It was the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetousness of men, answered he, who having long pursued me with fury, being greedy of such a Booty, I therefore thrust them in betwixt the Trunks of two Trees growing near to each other, and at the Expence of what they so earnestly sought after, I ransomed my Life. Going a little further, they
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:45842:67"/>
espyed coming towards them, a Beaver bleeding that had newly lost his Testicles. The Fox asking the occasion of his misfortune, understood by the poor Creature, that he himself had bit them off, being sensible that for their sakes, Men hunted him, and would have taken and kill'd him, Walking on, they were met by a Peacock, whose Wings and Tail having been stript of their Feathers, it was a hard thing to know what Bird he was: For which loss the Fox pitying him, desired to be informed who had, on that manner, plundred him? Men, said he, taken with the Beauty of my Glorious Plumes, caught me, and tore them off, to adorn their own pride with them. When they had left him, they went forwards and found a Vulture, whose Breast was all naked and raw, having had his downy Skin thus barbarously flee'd off alive; whom the Fox commiserating, entreated to tell how he had been brought into that deplorable Condition? Certain Curious Men, said he, coveting my soft Down, surprized me by their subtil Tricks, and used me as you see. They had scarce lost sight of the Vulture, when they met a Man loaded with several Bundles, followed by a small Troop of Children, ill clad, and his Wife bringing up the rear. He was courteously saluted by the Fox, and asked whither he was going, and whence he came with that Train. Alas! answered he, whither I go, I know not, but I come with this my distressed Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily from a Conquered City, lately most flourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; abounding in Riches, and flowing in a plenty of all things, which now by the fury of a Powerful Enemy is utterly destroyed, and in which Calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, I, from a Wealthy Citizen, have been reduced
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:45842:67"/>
to Beggery. Dost thou see? said the Fox to the Ape, that Riches and Plenty which are wont to raise their Minds, and so much please those who enjoy them, could not make their Possessors happy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Wherefore I advise thee so to dispose thy self, that thy Poverty may neither grieve thee, nor make thee ashamed.</p>

            <p>WE owe the first Invention of <hi>Fable</hi> to the Poets, but it is commonly made use of by the Orators, for inculcating their Arguments into their Auditory. A <hi>Fable</hi> is an invented <hi>Speech</hi> or <hi>Tale,</hi> which repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents the Truth by some pleasant Image. These <hi>Fables</hi> were anciently called either <hi>Sybaritic, Cilician,</hi> or <hi>Cyprian</hi>; Names taken from the Inventors of them, or Countries where they Inhabited; but because <hi>Aesop</hi> far out-did all others in Writing <hi>Fables,</hi> he got the Credit to have them called <hi>Aesopian,</hi> or <hi>Aesopic. Fable</hi> is said to be threefold, <hi>Rational, Moral,</hi> and <hi>Mixt.</hi> Rational, is when some thing is feigned to be done by Men: Moral, is when Mens Manners are imitated, by Creatures wanting Reason. Mixt, is that which introduces both Rational and Irrational Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. But the Admonition or Morality, for sake of which you invent the <hi>Fable,</hi> if you begin with it (as we often see it done by <hi>Phaedrus</hi>) 'tis called <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, or <hi>Antefabalatio</hi>: But if the <hi>Moral</hi> come after the <hi>Fable</hi> (as in <hi>Aesop,</hi> and most other My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thologists) it is called <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, or <hi>Adfabulatio.</hi>

               <p>A Man dying, left three Daughters; One of which was very Beautiful, and loving Gaye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that so she might entice Gallants to admire her. The second a good Huswife, extremely delighting
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:45842:71"/>
in a Country-life. The youngest unhandsom, and a great Wine-drinker. The Old Man made his Wife Executrix of his last Will and Testament, but on Condition, that she should distribute his whole Estate, real and personal, among his three Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters equally, and yet in such manner, as that neither of them should possess or enjoy what was given them; and that so soon as they should cease to have the proportions which fell to their respective shares, they should pay to their Mother a hundred Sertertia. The Rumour of this thing was spread over all the City of <hi>Athens</hi>; for the careful Mother consulted the most eminent Lawyers, but none could tell which way they should not possess their several Legacies, and yet receive the Benefit of them; and then, how they could pay such a summ to their Mother, when they could not come to meddle with any thing. After much time was spent, without being able to dive into the true mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Will, the Mother called Witnesses, and waving the Critical Interpretation of the Words, she undertook to dispose things on this manner: She gave the Amorous Lady the fine Cloathes, the Womens Jewels and Toys, the Plate belonging to the Bathes, and the like; also the smooth-faced Eunuchs to wait on her. To the good Huswife, she distributed the Country-House, the Fields and Flocks, the Labouring Servants, Oxen, Horses, with all the Necessary Furniture and Implements, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for a Country Life. And for the Drinker, she reserved the Cellers well stored with good Old Wines, a Magnificent House, with noble Gardens, Arbours, and Summer-houses, to drink in. When she would have Confirmed this Distribution, in
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:45842:71"/>
presence of her Friends and Acquaintance, <hi>Aesop,</hi> on a sudden, crouding in through the midst of them, Ah! said he, Were it possible for the Father to have a sense of this, after Death, how sorry, and how much ashamed would he be, that in all <hi>Athens</hi> there should not be a man able to explain the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his Will? He then being desired by them to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riddle it, began thus to clear it before them all: Give, said he, the City-House, Gardens, Orchards and Wines, to her that is enclined to a Country Life: The Rich Cloathes, Jewels, Plate, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> let the Bowsing Lady have: And to her that delights to spend her Life in Luxury and Wantonness, order the Fields, Vines, Flocks, Shepherds, and Plow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. On this manner, neither of them will enjoy what is suitable to their Humours. The unhand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som Daughter, that loves good Liquor, will sell all her Jewels for Wine. The Wanton Lady will part with her Lands to buy Gaudy Cloathes. And she that delights in Good Huswifery, and Country Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, being dissatisfied with her Splendid City-Dwelling and Furniture, will dispose of it. Thus none of them will possess what was given them, so that when they shall have sold their several shares, they may pay their Mother the summ appointed her by her Husbands Will. Thus the Prudence of one Man discovered what was a Mystery to so many.</p>

to do this, by the Goad which drives us on against our Wills. The Tree, with this reason, was satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied of their Innocence, and forgave them.</p>

               <p>NO Arguments could prevail with the Tail of a Serpent, but it would needs have its turn of Superiority, for sometime to precede and lead the others Members. They rationally urged the impossibility of it, the Tail having neither Eyes nor Nose to guide it, as other Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures had: But nothing would satisfie till it had its will. The tail then governed, and led the whole Body, but being blind, draged it till it fell into a deep Pit of Stones, cutting and bruising all the rest of its Members. In which distress, the afflicted Tail after this humble manner begged of the Head. Good Sir, be pleased to help us, for I have undertaken a presumptuous thing, and by my ill Conduct plunged my self into a Misfortune, from whence, without your prudent assistance, I shall never be able to redeem my self, nor those whom I have drawn into the same Calamity with me.</p>

very pleasantly, and telling him, that he brought such News as would (he doubted) scarce gain credit with him; and seeing the Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd listen to him, I come to you, proceeded the Fox, in behalf of the Wolf, who on any terms would be glad to see a Reconciliation of the Ancient Enmity betwixt the Sheep, and those of his Race. He condemns his nearest Relations and Friends, that cannot live with Creatures so peaceable and mild, that they may be justly termed the very Pattern of Goodness and Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence. And besides, he is so much in love with your Bagpipe, that hearing the Harmony you make with it, though so far off, he cannot for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear dancing; if therefore you please to permit him to come to you, you will find him of a most sweet Nature, and will rejoyce in his Friendship. The Shepherd who knew well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, the good understanding which for a long time had been betwixt those two Beasts, thus answered him. Though I have some small suspicion of the Messenger, yet I am content the Wolf should come hither, that he converse fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarly with the Sheep, and dance quietly to the Music of my Pipe: But on condirion, he first consent that I draw out his Teeth, and pair his Nails, they not being at all necessary for Conversation, nor for Dancing.

The Elephant hearing this, gave him a grave repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand for the saucy Character he had bestowed on him. But really it pitties me, added he, for our Friend the Whale, who has too unweildy a Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and which might therefore conveniently be reduced to a smaller Demension. The Whale, in anger, protested he liked well enough his large size. But, I must confess, pursued he, the Pis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire is a Creature too little for its Courage, Wit, and Industry; For so great Labours and continual
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:45842:82"/>
Fatigue require a stronger and more able Body to undergo them. You might spare your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marques on me, said the Pismire somewhat dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleased; For the Symetry of my Body is, in all respects, so compleatly adjusted to my Mind, that I desire it may remain just as it is. And she further told them that in comparison of the Mite, she seemed a huge Colossus. <hi>Iupiter</hi> then, after he had passed a pleasant Censure on them all, for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving so good Opinions of themselves, dismissed them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thus it is with us. Every one is a Linx to espy other Mens Faults, and a Mole at find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out his own.

               </head>
               <p>
                  <hi>ARion</hi> was an excellent Musician of <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thymna</hi> in the Isle of <hi>Lesbos,</hi> greatly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved and admired for his Skill, by <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riander</hi> King of <hi>Corinth.</hi> But he being curious to see other Countries, left the King and travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led into <hi>Sicily</hi> and <hi>Italy</hi>; where he not only ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired great Fame by his profound knowledge in that Science of Music, and his exquisit perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance thereof, but likewise gathered a conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable stock of Money in his Progress. There he spent some time till being desirous to return to <hi>Corinth,</hi> he Embarked on a Ship bound for that place. But the Marriners longing to share the Treasure they knew he had on board, resolved to kill him by the way. <hi>Arion</hi> perceiving their Design, for they had laid violent hands on him, begged them to spare his Life, and he would free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly give them all he had; or at least pray'd them to let him live till he had sung one Song to his Harp, to lament the hardness of his Fortune; which the Marriners, for sake of the Music, were content to grant. This excellent man then taking his Instrument, went up to the highest part of the Ships Stern, and sang aloud a Song in that Move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which the <hi>Greeks</hi> called <hi>Orthion,</hi> with ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable Sweetness and Passion, like the dying Swan; hoping thereby to have enclined the hard hearts of his Enemies to compassion. But when he had done, and found them still obstinate; He
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:45842:83"/>
threw himself immediately into the Sea with his Harp in his Hand, where those Wretches left him to perish. But a very strange and miraculous thing befel him; For a Dolphin, the Friend of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, swimming to him, took him on his back, and carrying him along upon the very surface of the Water, landed him safely at the Promontory of <hi>Taenarus</hi> in the Country of <hi>Laconia.</hi> From thence he went to <hi>Corinth,</hi> presenting himself be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore King <hi>Periander,</hi> and told him all that had happened. The King not giving Credit to his Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, sent him to Prison, till the Marriners of his Vessel, who were to have brought him, were examined; But they confessed only, that they heard he had been in <hi>Italy,</hi> much Honoured and Caressed in all the Cities where he came; and that he had there heaped up much wealth; which was all they knew of him. When they would confess no further, <hi>Arion</hi> appear'd to them, in the very same Cloaths, with his Harp, and all his Equipage, as he was when thrown into the Sea. The sight of which so astonished the Marriners that they could not deny the Fact, and soon after received the just punishment of their Crime. This Fable was much talked of, both in <hi>Lesbos,</hi> and at <hi>Corinth,</hi> where they had the Story most admirably represented in Brass, of a Harper dismounting from the back of a Dolphin, on the Sea shoar, near the Mountain <hi>Taenarus.</hi>

               </head>
               <p>
                  <hi>TWo Storks had their Nest on a House Top, wherein they not only kept their Young ones, but also their aged Father and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. These perceiving, first by an extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Smoak, and then by the appearance of Flame, that their House was accidentally set on Fire, and in danger of being burnt to the Ground. One of them took his Father upon his back, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying him down, left him in security, whilst the other made on the same manner a Flight with her Mother; for which they were angrily up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braided by a Kite, who called them Wicked and Cruel, unworthy to have Children, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded maliciously to tell them, they unnatural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly exposed their Young to the Flames, when it was in their power to preserve them, while they were thus employed in carrying off those Skelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons of their old Parents, who were now but a Burden to Nature. I love my Children very well, reply'd the Stork, but I love those better who brought me into the Light of the World, for I may in time have other Children, but can never have another Father and a Mother.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>'Tis impossible to foresee all Accidents that may happen; and it is great Prudence to endeavour to preserve what we have most value for, but especially that, which if lost can never more be recovered. God and Nature oblige us to prefer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> our Father and our Mother to any other thing in the
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:45842:89"/>
World. These Storks are the great Example of Filial Duty to Parents; and are reported not only to take care to nourish them in their old Age, but to pluck off from themselves their softest Feathers to make their Nests easie for them. <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> the Famous <hi>Athenian,</hi> to ransom his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, thrust himself into a Goal, where, when he was loaded with Chains and Fetters, he boasted he had never before enjoyed so great a pleasure. Another remarkable instance of this kind, is that of <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, who going to make War against <hi>Darius</hi> King of <hi>Persia,</hi> left <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pater</hi> an Assistant to his Mother, to help her Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern the Kingdom of <hi>Macedonia</hi> in his absence; but whether or no she managed affairs with the Prudence she ought to have done, or that she in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to favour some other Person more than himself, <hi>Antipater</hi> was often writing long Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to <hi>Alexander,</hi> complaining of the Disorders which happened by her ill Conduct: But as that incomparable Monarch, was on a time reading one of those Letters, in presence of his Dear Friend <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phestion. Antipater,</hi> said he, (expressing great Tenderness) does not know, that one Tear of my Mothers is sufficient to cancel all the Complaints, and Accusations of every one of his long Letters. Words which ought to be engraved in indelable Characters on the Hearts of Children, who have any pretence of Complaint against their Parents. <hi>Li Padri, e le Madri non sono d' alcuna cosa obligati a li Figliuoli, ed' essi per lo contrario tuto loro devono, poiche devono loro la vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta.</hi> Parents, saies an <hi>Italian,</hi> are not for any thing obliged to their Children, but on the

The kind Eagle left the Rock where she was accustomed to build, and made her Nest in a high Tree, beneath which, the Fox had lodged her Cubbs among certain Bushes. But this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidious Eagle on a time wanting food for her Young, and knowing the Fox was abroad seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his prey, she without regard to her plighted Faith, and Friendship, flew down to the shrubs, and seizing the Young Foxes, carried them all up to the Nest; where she with her hungry Brood devoured them. The Fox returning at night, and missing those for whom she had been making provision, was infinitly afflicted, easily concluding they had been taken away by her false Neighbour, and not able to revenge her self, she being a terrestrial Creature, and her Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my a valiant Towering Bird, she in the sorrow of her heart for her loss, cursed her cruel Enemy and invoked the Gods to punish the Treachery; turning from thenceforward all her Love into mortal Hatred. Now it happened a few daies after, that as they were sacrificing a Goat to the
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:45842:93"/>
God <hi>Pan</hi> in a Neighbouring Village, the Eagle snatched away a piece of the Flesh from the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, to which there hanging a Live Fire Coal, and she carrying it up into the Tree; the Coal quickly set the Nest on Fire, being all made of Straw, Sticks, and other combustible matter. So soon therefore as the young Eagles began to feel the Heat, and not being yet perfectly able to fly, they fell down to the Ground, where they were all seized with great eagerness by the Fox, who without any pity, eat them in sight of their afflicted Mother.</p>

                  <hi>Those who break Friendship and their Solemn Faith, tho the Persons injured cannot revenge themselves upon them, yet they seldom escape the Iudgement of God. Nor could the Eagle, for this action, have any pretence, of Mother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Charity, for preserving the Lives of her Young, since she should rather have chosen to have died with all her Brood, than have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted so base a Breach of Faith against a Friend.

               <p>A Monkey seeing a Walnut-tree well stored with Green Nuts, was curious to know the Name and Goodness of the Fruit, and being told that those Nuts contained Kernels of an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent and delightful tast, he began to be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed with the Thoughts of eating them, but was puzzled to find out a way to get to them, for the Tree was large, and the Body high before there were any Boughs to lay hold on. He was therefore at last forced to go to the next Village, where find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a long Ladder, he with great labour, drag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged it to the Tree, and with no less Toil and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry raised it, so that with infinite satisfaction, he climbed up. There taking a Nut, he bit it
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:45842:96"/>
entirely through the outward green Rind, the shell, and the kernel, and tasting the Bitterness of the Peel, threw it aside as Bad, or not ripe; but when he had tried several others, and found none of any pleasanter tast, all proving as bitter as the first, he threw them down in great anger, ne'r troubling himself further in search of the Ker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels. At which disappointment, after he had a while vexed and fretted himself: Ah! cursed be they, cried he, who first showed me these filthy Nuts, they who praised them to me, and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged me to take all this Trouble to gather, and to eat them: For in all the daies of my Life, I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver underwent so much Toil and vexation, and yet have spent all my time and pains to no Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit. Thus the sweet they made me believe I should find in this Fruit is in all respects turned to Bitterness. And when he had for sometime vented, on this manner, his rage, he went away.</p>

preserved as their Houshold Gods and Prote<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ctors, and ever kept them entire.

But when all entreaties could nothing avail, and that the Frogs derided them, alledging, that tho their Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors knew not how to make use of their own, yet we, said they, do.

For which, the just vengeance of Heaven was not long ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, and the wicked cruelty of this ungrateful Generation was quickly turned upon their own heads; For the Flags were no sooner eaten up, and the place become bare, but these Frogs were espyed, and lay wholly exposed, as well to the Birds and Fowls of the Air, as to the Serpents and Snakes inhabiting the Lake, by whom they were all in a short time devoured.</p>

               <p>A Shepherd and Shepherdess that for some years had lived together in a most hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Union, and with unspeakable content, were separated in an instant by the Death of that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compatable Woman; who sleeping on the Grass, was kill'd by the biting of a Serpent. The sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowful Shepherd having even to excess lamented his Misfortune, built a Tomb wherein he laid her: On which he let not a Day pass, without strewing the sweetest Herbs and Flowers: and took so great care of it, that he suffered not any kind of Creature to come near it, for fear of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facing it. One day as he was treading on the Worms, which crept out of the Grave, as his custom was, he heard certain mournful Groans issuing out from thence; which made him listen more attentively, and hear these Word. Curteous Shepherd, be not so Cruel to Her, whom thou didst once so dearly Love; Those Worms thou killest, thinking to do a kindness to me, are a part of my self, which if thou wilt not believe, raise up with thy hand the Stone that covers me, and thou wilt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of it. The Shepherd thereupon, lifting up the Stone, saw innumerable Worms creeping from her Face and Body, and heard the same voice continue to say; forget what I have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly been: but remember that thou thy self shalt 'ere long be what thou now seest I am
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:45842:102"/>
He was so touched with those her last Words, that neglecting his Flocks, he, for the future, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver fixed his chiefest thoughts on Death, and from that Object would seldom remove them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>This shews that none are exempt from dying. That Death hides himself the better to surprize us. That they may be said to love even after Death, who loved truly when alive. That the loveliest Body will turn to Putrifaction, and at last to Worms. The frequent thoughts we have of Death, makes it the less dreadful, and us the less fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of it. Our best Meditation is on Death, for the thoughts of that, are capable to teach us how to live well.</hi> Francis <hi>the first, Duke of</hi> Britany, <hi>finding himself near Death, in the very Flower of his Age.

               <p>THus arrogantly was a Princely Lion accost<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a brisk Gnat. Thou, said this little Creature, who unworthily usurpest the Title of King of the Beasts, what hast thou to boast of, besides thy huge Bulk, thy brutish Strength, and thy sharp Nailes, and Teeth; with which thou fightest, biting and scratching like a Woman; and on those generally shewest thy valour, who
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:45842:109"/>
are weak and not able to resist thee? Behold Me, a small Insect, yet of greater Courage and more true valour than thou Art; and to make good what I say, I here challenge thee to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, nor will I fall on thee basely, as thou for the most part dost treacherously on those whom thou makest thy prey; but I shall first bid thee defiance by the sound of my own Trumpet. The Gnat had no sooner ended, but flew briskly humming round the careless Lion, and got, e're he was aware, into his Nostril, where she began to bite and torment him. Which smart, the Lion not able to endure, tare with his Paws his own Nose; raging with great Fury, &amp; at last threw and beat himself on the ground, where he lay roar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. The Gnat then looking upon him as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered, came out, and with her Trumpet pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed her Victory. But as she thus flew tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphing about, by mischance she happened into a Spiders Webb; where finding her self ready to be devoured; Alas, cryed she, I, that have fought with, and vanquished the most no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and most valiant Creature of the World, am now to suffer Death by a Spider, one of the vilest of all Insects.</p>

               <p>AMongst other Precepts, which an old Lion taught his Son, he gave him an express charge never to engage in fight with a Man; For he, said the Father, is a Creature, subtil, and not to be conquered. The young Lion heard this, but with no intention to observe it: For, some time after, when grown almost to his full bigness, and become sensible of his great strength and vigor; he went out with a resolution to encounter a Man; and seeing in a Field a pair of Oxen yoak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed together, he came up to them, asking them if they were Men? They satisfied him, they were not Men, but that a Man had laid that yoak upon their Necks. Leaving these, he espyed a Horse well Equipped in all his proper Capari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, and tyed to a Tree by the reins of his Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle; Of him he demanded, Art thou a Man? No Sir, answered the Horse, but I am subject to a Man and serve him. Travelling on, he saw by the side of a Wood, a Carpenter cleaving a Tree, to whom he running, Art thou, demanded the Lion, a Man? I am so, answered he. Then, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded the other, will you fight me? With all my heart, replyed the Man. But first, pray do me the favour to help pull this Tree in pieces for me, where you see the Iron Wedges sticking in it; and afterwards we shall have leisure e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to fight. This the Lion readily under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took, and puting his Paws into the Clift, as the
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:45842:110"/>
Man directed him, he began to pull with all his strength, whilst the Man with his Ax forced out the Wedges; After which, the Tree suddainly closing, held the Lions Paws so fast, that he was no way able to get loose. The Man then whoop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and hallowing, called to his Neighbours and Fellow Work-men for help, to kill the Lion: who seeing himself in this Exegency, recollected all his Forces, and giving a suddain spring, he drew out his Toes, but left his Nailes sticking fast in the Tree; Then running with what speed he was able, home to his Father, and shewing his bloody Feet. Ah Father, cryed he, had I fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed your prudent Admonitions, I had not thus unfortunately lost my Nailes.</p>

<pb n="191" facs="tcp:45842:112"/>
and Bones. By these means I feed plentifully, sleep in a warm place under shelter, want no Drink, nor other Conveniencies, and spend my daies in Idleness; Ah Brother, said the Wolf, would I knew how I might enjoy so happy a life! That, without taking pains, I might lay me down at Night to sleep with my belly full. Well, said the Dog, if you desire to live thus in ease, and can but suppress a little, your ravenous Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, come along with me and fear nothing, for I doubt not but to procure you my Masters fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour.

At this sight, his curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>osity being moved, Brother, said he, what is it you wear about your Neck that leaves these un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seemly Marks behind it? To make me the Fiercer, answered the Dog, they chain me within all day, &amp; let me loose at Bed-time, that I may go up and down the House and Yard in the Night, or sleep, when and where I please. The Wolf hearing this, Much good may it do you with your easie life, said he, but as for my part, I had rather enjoy my Freedom, tho I suffer some small Inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies. For I go where I will, and have no chain to restrain me; I take my ranges about the Fields, the Mountains and the Woods without controul.

            <head>The PREFACE. TO The Third Century OF FABLES.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>FABLES</hi> are not only delightful, but very profitable to the <hi>Readers,</hi> if well understood; for as the <hi>Bees</hi> will not be satisfied with the Beauty of the Flower, till they have sucked out its Honey; so is not the <hi>Fable,</hi> or <hi>Tale,</hi> so much to be valued, as the good <hi>Morality</hi> and <hi>Erudition</hi> which is to be drawn from it. The Word <hi>Fabula,</hi> seems to be derived <hi>a Fando,</hi> from Speaking; for <hi>Fables</hi> are supposed to be things spoken only, but not done. They were first Invented, that by the Feigned Words, and Pleasant Tricks of Irrational Creatures, the ill Manners and Actions of bad Men might be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved, and the Vertues of good Men encouraged. We read of diverse sorts of <hi>Fables</hi> amongst the <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets,</hi> but I shall wave at present their several Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctions, and only speak of those whereof <hi>Aesop</hi> is generally supposed to be the Inventor. He, with the rest of my Authors, have taught the use of Speech, as well to things Insensible, as Sensible; and here, as in some Republick, they all Act in their se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:45842:126"/>
Sphers; They summon their Councils, or Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates; Determine the weighty Affairs of State; De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberate of Peace and War, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And what is all this for? but to Instruct Mankind by Moral Precepts and Examples, dressed up in these pleasant Tales, that they may be more readily entertained by all sorts of People. By <hi>Fables</hi> may even Children be taught by their Nurses, and that by way of Recreation, to be in Love with Vertue, and Hate Vice; which way of Instructing Youth has been recommended by great Men, but particularly by the two Princes of Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, <hi>Plato</hi> in his Second Dialogue, <hi>de Republ.</hi> and by <hi>Aristotle</hi> in his <hi>Politicks.</hi> And how in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed could vulgar Understandings be made capable of receiving such grave and solid Rules of Vertue, if they were not by some Art fixed in their Minds, by such Images, and Idea's, as these? Here are the Good and Ill Inclinations of Creatures represented. Here you find Simplicity commended in the <hi>Lamb,</hi> and in the <hi>Dove;</hi> Diligent Labour and Industry in the <hi>Bee,</hi> and the <hi>Ant;</hi> Fidelity in the <hi>Dog;</hi> Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and Generosity in the <hi>Lyon;</hi> which Vertues are likewise highly applauded in Man. We also see a Hair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brained Fury, and Rapacity blamed in the <hi>Wolf;</hi> a Sordid Dulness, and Slothfulness in the <hi>Ass;</hi> Fraud, Flattery, and subtle Insinuation in the <hi>Fox;</hi> and all manner of Vices by some Creature or other properly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed, and then rendred Odious. The Intention of all which is, that we seeing, as in a Glass, the Beauty of Vertue, and Deformity of Vice, might prudently steer the Course of our Lives, by those Lines which are here so Industriously laid down for our use.</p>

               <head>FAB. I. The Quarrel betwixt the <hi>Members</hi> of a Human Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and the <hi>Stomach.</hi>
               </head>
               <figure/>
               <p>IN those times when in Man, the several Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of his Body acted not as now they do, all by a mutual consent, but every one did accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his own Fancy. The Feet and Hands envi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:45842:127"/>
accused the Stomach of Slothfulness; You, said they, receive all our good things, and enjoy them: We take the pains, whilst you reap all the Profit and Pleasure; whatsoever we acquire by our Labour and Industry, you devour, living in continual Laziness: You therefore shall take your choice of two things, either to learn some Art for your own Maintenance, or else resolve to Perish by Hunger; and thus in a Passion these Members deserted it. Now the Stomach know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not how to subsist of it self, begged several times, with great Humility, their Help and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour; but they still refused to listen to it. So that being for some days forced to live without Nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishment, its natural heat was quite gone, and Thirst having dryed up the Throat, Nature had utterly lost all her Powers; And then alas! the Hands, when too late, perceiving the Body ready to expire, offered it Meat and Food in abund<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, with all sorts of Delicates; but it was to no purpose, for the Stomach having been long empty, was become feeble, and could not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form its Functions. Thus died the whole Body, by the Effects of the Envy and Dissenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of its Members.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Society of the Members with the Stomach, are like Human Society, each Member having need of the rest of the Members to be able to subsist: So does every one want the <gap reason="illegible: over-inked" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> and Friendship of other Men; for Riches and Honour are not sufficient here without Friends to stand by and assist us. But I cannot pass by this admirable</hi> Fable, <hi>without giving a larger account of its History and Allegory.</hi> Titus Livius <hi>tells us in
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:45842:127"/>
his</hi> Decades, <hi>That the People of</hi> Rome <hi>revolt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the Senate, had assembled together on Mount</hi> Aventine, <hi>resolving no longer to pay O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to the Senate. But the Senate sent</hi> Menenius Agrippa, <hi>a man of great Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and Reputation in the City, who related to them this</hi> Fable <hi>at large, letting them see by the Example of the Stomach, and Parts of mans Body, the mutual dependence of the Senate and the People one upon another.</hi> For do not think <hi>(said he)</hi> my fellow Citizens, that tho the Government or Senate seem Idle to you, and that they keeping the People to their several Trades and Occupations, are for that Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son the less necessary for your preservation. It is the Government which dispenses the Heat to you, which fits and distributes the good Nourishment to all its most remote Members. Nor suppose that you work for them, but they much more for you. Do not then so weaken this part of you, by your factious Mutinies, that it be made incapable of serving you; for after some little time, Necessity will constrain you to fly to the Senate for their help, when perchance it may not be in their power. Your Seditions and Extravagancies may oblige them to take another course, and then you will live with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out defence, void of all Counsel and Help, without Riches, without Authority, and in one word, a Prey to your Neighbours. <hi>This, or the like Speech, wrought so effectually with the Mutineers, that they all retired home to their Houses. By which we may Iudg how necessary
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:45842:128"/>
it is, that there should be a mutual Union of all the Members for preservation of the Body, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Natural, or Politick: For it is impossible, that either the one, or the other should subsist with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Concord, which is the Chain that binds them together. 'Tis therefore no wonder, that the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor hereof, proposed this</hi> Fable <hi>of the Stomach and the other Members, to make us hate Factions and Divisions, which often prove the Ruin and utter Destruction of Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths, by exposing them to the Fury of their Enemies.</hi> Concordiâ res parvae crescunt, Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordiâ, vel maximae dilabuntur.

               <p>IT was a Horses hard Fortune to serve a cruel Master, who allowing him scarce half his due proportion of Meat, his Bones seemed ready to start through his Skin. This poor Beast drawing a heavy load in a deep way, happened to be set

fast in a miry place, from whence not being able to stir, he, by the surly Carter, was miserably bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten. The wretched Horse then considering the difficulties he laboured under, and that this unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable Man imposed a task on him, which he had not strength enough to perform, was very sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowful, accusing his Master of too great severity and injustice. But the furious Driver enflamed to a greater pitch of Rage, without any sense of pitty towards him, still lashed him more and more, and instead of cherishing him, gave him at last this uncomfortable Sentence: I'll force thee, either to draw out this Cart from hence, or here I'm re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved to make thee breathe thy last.</p>

               <p>OUT of his closest lurking Places in the Woods, as a Stag was chased by Hunters, being guided by his blind Fears, he fled for shelter to a near Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage, and it being Evening, there opportunely hid himself, in a Stable amongst certain Oxen. Whom <hi>one</hi> of the Oxen courteously saluting, What safety canst thou here, said he, propose to thy self, wretched
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:45842:130"/>
Creature, that comest posting to thy inevitable Destruction, thinking to save thy self among Men? Do not I beseech you discover me, said the Stag, and I will be gone with the first opportunity. When it was Night, a Servant came in to feed the Oxen, but saw him not; next, several other Clowns went in and out, without espying him, who had hid himself in the Hay. After these, the chief Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant looked in, and did not perceive him. The Trembling Stag then began to take some Courage, hoping the Danger over, and thanked the Oxen for having so kindly entertained him in this Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency. We wish you well, answered they, but lye close yet a while longer, lest he who has a hundred Eyes should come, and then your Life would be in great hazard. Whilst they were saying this, the Master himself newly risen from Supper, came in, and having lately observed his Oxen to be lean and neglected, looked into the Manger, where he found they wanted Hay, and that other things were in disorder; He therefore taking care to put them as they ought to be, espyed the Stags Horns appearing aloft out of the Hay. Then calling his Servants, he commanded them to kill him. Which being done, he possessed himself of the Prey.</p>

               </head>
               <p>THE great overflowing of a River by some violent Rains, had carried away from its Bankside a <hi>Dragon,</hi> who had long dwelt there; and the River falling on a sudden, left him very remote on a dry Sand; from whence not being able to get home, wanting Water, he was lamenting at the great distress he saw him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self in. But espying a Country-man, who was travelling that way with an Ass; the Dragon cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to him, entreating him to be so charitable to carry him home to the River, not being able to get thither without help, and promised for the favour, to give him great store of Gold and Silver. The hopes of such a reward made the poor Man undertake the charge, who according to direction bound the Dragon, laid him on his Ass, and carried him to his Cave; where so soon as he had untied him and set him at liberty, he demanded his pay. How said the Dragon, Do you expect Gold and Silver for tying and penion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me on that manner? I did it, replied the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try-man by your own Order. Well, added the Dragon, cease your impertinence, or I shall make bold to eat you, for I protest have a keen Stomach at this very moment. Would you then reward me Evil for Good? demanded the poor man. While they were in this dispute, a Fox came that way and enquired the cause of their difference? The Dragon told him, that the man had tied
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:45842:137"/>
and abused him, carrying him on his Ass, and now expected mony for the injury. Very unjustly, said the poor man, has this Dragon abused me, for I found him far from this place, left on dry Ground, whither he had been carried by this River; and from thence at his earnest request, promising me a considerable recompence of Gold and Silver, I brought him bound, as he directed me, safely home; and now he ungratefully threatens to devour me. You did saucily, said the Fox, to bind him so hard; but let me see how it was, and I shall the better Judg betwixt you both. The man beginning to bind him, Did the Fellow, said the Fox, bind you thus hard be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore? Not only so, answered the Dragon, but a hundred times worse. Then said the Fox, draw the Knots straiter. The Country-man being strong, tied the Cords with all his force. Was you thus cruelly bound? demanded the Fox. Ay Indeed Sir, answered the Dragon. 'Twas barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously done, added the Fox, for now you have no power to help your self. Not any, said the Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon. Then said the Fox to the Man, thou maist lay him again on thy Ass, and carry him back to the place where thou foundest him; there leave him bound, and thou wilt be sure he cannot eat thee. The man rejoycing to be so well delivered from, and revenged of this perfidious Dragon, did as the Fox had Judged, and left him there to perish.</p>

And to this purpose, continued he (raising his Voice somewhat high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,) O ye Judges! will I relate to you an admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Story, if you please, of the shadow of an Ass. At these words, the Judges ceased their Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, and having commanded a general Silence: There was a young Man, proceeded the Orator, who in Summer time, had hired an Ass, to carry <hi>goods</hi> from thence to <hi>Megara</hi>; with which coming about Noon to a place on the Road, that afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed no Shelter against the Scorching Beams of the Sun; and being tired with walking, he took off the Load, and was about to have lain down on it, in the shadow of the Ass; which the Owner, who went with him to bring back his Beast, would not suffer, but forced the young Man away, and alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that though he had hired the Ass, he could have no pretence to the shadow of it. The young Man on the other side, insisted on his right; for I having purchased, said he, with my Money the
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:45842:141"/>
use of the Ass for this day, he is only at my dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posal, and I, as his true Proprietor, during this Journey, ought to have the sole enjoyment also of his Shadow. Heat of Argument betwixt these two, at last produced a Quarrel, and from Words they fell to Blows. But after a fierce Combate, which could not determine the right of one or the other to the Asses Shadow; with bloody Noses and swel'd Eyes, they were glad to leave off by consent, and to proceed on in their Journey; both resolving that at <hi>Megara</hi> they would joyn Issue, and try it out by Law. <hi>Demosthenes</hi> coming thus far, and observing the Court very attentive to his <hi>Fable,</hi> made a sudden pause, and was going from the Bar, but being called back by the Judges, and desired to go on with his Story: Are you, said he, so ready to listen to a foolish Tale of the Shadow of an Ass, and yet stop your Ears in a Cause wherein the Life of a Man is in Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion? Can you listen with pleasure to such idle Tales<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and are you so soon weary with hearing serious Matters?

<q>And I could wish (continues my Author) that many of our Magistrates Ears now a daies, were not more attentive to such Tales of the Shadow of an Ass, I mean, to things triffling and ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, than to those whereon depend the Lives and Fortunes of poor men in distress.

               <p>AN Ass, and a large pot of good Wine, was almost all the substance of a poor Wretch, who marrying his Daughter, had promised for her Portion all the Money for which he should sell that Wine and the Ass. But it unfortunately happened on the very Wedding Night, that the Ass fell sick, and just before he expired, as he was strugling for Life, he kicked out his Legs, brake the Pot, and spilt all the Wine; by which the Bride was deprived of her Dowry.</p>

that way. From thence he had cast his poison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Eyes on a harmless Weasel, whom he often observed to pass boldly within the Walks of his Precinct, and expected to stick dead with his Looks as it went to drink: But the little Creature by its Prudence, made impotent and void all the endeavours of its wicked Enemy. For this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustrious Warrior being defended by his proper Arms, durst face the dangerous mouth of that dismal Cave, knowing himself safe, whilst e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quipped with a branch of Rue, which is said to be a Preservative against all manner of Venom; for with this Herb he always girt his Body, still expecting to meet his Adversary; and by this means preserved himself from the mortal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagion.</p>

Drums and other Instruments; by which they picked up Money in the several places where they came. These Priests had an Ass, whereon they car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried about their Luggage; which Ass being dead, with his daily hard Labour, his continual Beat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and ill Usage by the Priests; they flea'd him, and with his Skin headed a Drum. Some People afterwards asking them what was become of their old Friend the Ass, whom they used to make much of? They were by the Priests, answered on this manner: He had thought he should have been at rest and quiet, at least when dead, but you see we still contiune beating him even after his Death. <hi>Phaedrus</hi> says:

               <p>'TIS dangerous both to Believe, and not to Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve; which I briefly can make out by Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples. For <hi>Hippolytus</hi> lost his life, because his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Theseus</hi> believed <hi>Phaedra,</hi> his Sons Mother-in-Law against him: And <hi>Troy</hi> was destroyed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the <hi>Trojans</hi> would not believe <hi>Cassandra</hi> their Prophetess. Therefore must we carefully examine the verity of every thing; lest by taking wrong Impressions into our minds, we be indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to give rash Judgments of them. But for fear I should lessen this Truth, by these Fabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Stories of Antiquity, I shall relate to you a memorable Accident, that I knew in my time.</p>
               <p>A Man who dearly loved his Wife, and had a Son to whom he was almost ready to give the White Robe (which was for Youths of about Fourteen or Fifteen Years of Age) had also a freed man, who plotting to become his Masters Heir, pulled him aside, and whispered false Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries to him against his Son, and more against the Honour of his Wife, who was really chast: At last, he added that which he thought would utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:45842:145"/>
destroy the Affection he knew he had for her; That she frequently entertained a Gallant, who used to come to her in private; which Infamous Correspondence of theirs, would blemish the Reputation of his Family with Adultery. The Credulous Husband transported with rage against his Wife falsly accused, pretended to take a Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney into the Countrey, but privately staid in the Town where they dwelt, and coming home sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly in the Night into his House, went directly up into his Wives Chamber, where the Son lay a sleep in the Bed with his Mother, who would have him near her, to take the greater care of him at this Age. Whilst the Servants were run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning about to get a Light, this impatient man not able to restrain the violence of his Jealous Passion, stept towards the Bed; where, as he groped in the dark, finding the Head of some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>body whom he felt had short Hair, he thrust his Sword through his Body, not thinking on any thing but the satisfying his Revenge, for the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front done to his Honour. By and by when the Light came, he saw his Son Murthered, and by him his chast VVife lying in the Bed, who being but in her first Sleep, heard Nothing of what had happened: The Husband when sensible of the horrid Crime he had committed; he, as a punishment for it, ran himself through the Body, with the same Sword, with which his rashness and credulity had thus made him kill his own dear Son. The Accusers afterwards pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuted this Woman, and brought her to <hi>Rome,</hi> before he <hi>Centumviri,</hi> or Hundred Judges. There was her Innocence blackned with scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:45842:146"/>
Surmises, because she remained Mistress of the Estate: But her Friends pleaded hard in her vindication; 'till the Judges at last were forced to beseech the Emperor <hi>Augustus,</hi> that he would be pleased to help them to acquit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves of their charge, they not being able to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine so ambiguous a Matter. This wise Prince having dispersed the Clouds of Calumny, which had 'till then obscured the Ladies Vertue, and penetrated to the very bottom of the Truth of this Affair, pronounced this Judgment; Let the Freed-man, said he, who was the only cause of all this Mischief, suffer the punishment he deserves: But as for the Woman, who has lost both her Son and Husband, I rather think her worthy of Compassion than Condemnation. For had the Husband taken good care to have examined these scandalous accusations against his Family; and had diligently made search into the matter to discover its Original, he had not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted so horrid a Deed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Do not therefore slight any thing that shall be told you; and yet do not immediately believe all you shall hear; for many times those are guilty, whom you think most Innocent; and those most mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciously accused as guilty, who are really most clear. The meanest Capacities may learn from this History, not to pass a rash Iudgment only from the insinuating Suggestions of another; for men being pushed on by different Desires and Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, do ordinarily act either by aversion or by favour. So you ought not to think you know a man by any report of him, 'till it be confirmed by your own Knowledg. I have been longer upon

               <p>A Young Scholler, who much delighted in hearing Fables, importuned his Tutor to tell him a very long one. Take heed, said the Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, the same happen not to you, which once did to a King from his Fabulist. Good Sir, said the Youth, let me know what that was? The Tutor then related to him the Following Fable.</p>
               <p>There was a King who kept a Fabulist, or Composer of Fables, that when the King was inclined to Mirth, was to tell him five Fables,
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:45842:150"/>
Tales, or Jests, for his Recreation. Now it chanced on a Night that the King being some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what indisposed, and not able to fall a Sleep, sent for his Fabulist, commanding him to tell some other Tales, over and above the usual Number. He unwillingly obeying, quickly told three: but the King complaining they were too short, bad him think on others that were longer; after which he should go to Bed. The Fabulist then began another on this manner. Once upon a time, there was a Country-man, who having by his Industry and good Fortune got together a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable Sum of Money, went to a Market and bought with it two Thousand Sheep; but in his Journey home, could not possibly get his Sheep over a River, neither by the common Ford, nor the Bridge, by reason of a sudden Flood, caused by some violent Showers of Rain, newly fallen there. The Country-man was troubled to think what he should do in this distress; til at last he found a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Boat, in which he could make shift only to Ferry over a couple at a time. With this was he forced to begin to Row over his Sheep, by two and two; and saying these words the Fabulist fell asleep. But the King calling, awaked him, and bad him proceed on in his Tale. May it please Your Majesty, said the Poor man, rubbing his Eyes; The River is broad, the Boat small, and the Number of the Sheep very great; I beseech you let the Countrymans Sheep be all Ferried over, and then I shall tell Your Majesty the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of my Fable. VVith which pleasant saying, the King who was such a Lover of Fables, was well enough satisfied.</p>

Who amongst all your Subjects, Royal Sir, has shown that care and concern for the Life and Health of his King as I have done? who have been travelling many Countries in search of a Medicine that might Cure you; and now at last, by my great Industry, have, I hope, found out a present and most effectual Remedy for your Distemper. The Lyon over joyed at the News, asked what it was? It is to take a Live Wolf, answered the Fox, strip off his Skin, and wrap it about your back, where your chiefest pain lies. This must be applied while the Skin is reeking warm; and in a short time it will give you ease. The Lyon hearing this, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the miserable Wolfs Skin to be torn off, which was immediately done, and applied to the Lyons back.

               <p>MAny Attempts had a Monkey made for some Roasted Chestnuts, which he saw lying in the Embers, and earnestly longed for, but could not come at them with safety to his Fing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; nor could he reach any Instrument, that would serve to draw them to him. At last he contrived to effect the business, by means of a young Cat, who lay sleeping in the Chimney Corner. Her he caught up, and holding her fast in his Arms, stretched out one of her fore Feet, and with it pull'd out the Nuts. The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jur'd Cat afterwards expostulating in Tears with the Monkey about her burnt Claw, asked him how he could be so cruel to her, whom he must needs think to be as sensible of the Fires heat as

One of these Female Apes, with her Twins, was running away to avoid an approaching Danger, having that which she best loved, in her Arms, and the other hanging on her Shoulders; But in her hasty flight, she chanced to strike the head of her Darling against a Stone, of which bruise it dyed.

               <p>
                  <pb n="286" facs="tcp:45842:162"/>
                  <hi>It often happens that the Son least beloved by his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, has better Fortune than the Darling, who is too frequently spoiled by their over fondness of him. When he must not, for fear of prejudicing his health, and killing him, he expos'd to the heat of the Sun, to the cold Winds, nor to the Rain, or any unseasonable Weather; Is not this to make him effeminate? When there is such Care to be used about the choiceness of his Diet, the feeding him by Weight and Measure, and often Physicking him: Is not this the ready way to throw him into some dangereus Distempers, and to hasten his Death? Why then should Childrens Constituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, be accustomed to that which may fail, and not rather to that which they may scarcely expect ever to miss of? Is it possible, to make them hate Idleness, and yet breed them up only in Wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonness and Pleasures? To teach them Sobriety, and yet suffer them to go on in an uncontrollable Course of Rudeness and Extravagance? And to take from them all Apprehension and Dread of their Enemies, whilst they are made afraid of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry cold blast, or showr of Rain. And yet this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessive Fondness of Parents, has far worse Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequences, since it corrupts the very Soul. For if good Instructions be a second Birth, and if that depend on, and be improved by the checking of Vices, to which our Nature is but too subject; Do not the Indulgent Mothers destroy their Children, whilst they will not suffer them to receive a just Correction for their Faults? If they be permitted to run on in a full Carrier of their Rage and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge; is not this to encourage them hereafter to be Assassinates? If they be left to execute their
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:45842:162"/>
private Piques, and Malicious Tricks, on their Brethren or Companions, is not this to make them become Traitors? If they be not chastiz'd for their loose, and obscene Words, and Discourses; Is not this to give them a fair Encouragement to Lewd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Dehauchery? And if they be commonly suffered to eat to excess; is not this to make them Gluttons? So that I may say of such Mothers; It had been better they had been Barren, than thus promoted the Ruin of their Children. Hence I infer that Youths, the less they are Humo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in their own idle Fancies, and Extravagan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, and the less indulged by the Fondness of their Parents; become afterwards the more Sober and Vertuous. For we find that by these means they attain to a strong Constitution of Body, which makes them Generous and Adventurous Men; That Exercise makes the best Blood; That Sobri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety in their Child-hood is confirmed in them, when at mature Age. And in a word, that Youth not spoil'd by Flattery, is capable of all Vertue.</hi>

O dear Mamma! cry'd he, what have I seen? VVhat was it, demanded the troubled Mother, thou sawest? Oh Mamma, answered he, I saw a terrible Creature, with a piece of Flesh on his Head like a Crown, and Horns growing on his Leggs; who with Things like Arms raised up himself, and beating his Breast, and Flank, made

of a considerable Reward, perswaded her to undertake it; who putting down her Long Bill into his Throat pulled out the Bone. But when she afterwards demanded of him the promised Recompence. Dost thou think it, answered the perfidious Wolf, but a small Recompence, that thou hast been suffered to draw back in safty thy Head out of a Wolfs Jawes, when it was in his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, (had he not been kind to thee) to have bit it off?

               <p>HOW to become Rich in a short time, was the daily study of a Covetous Man, who being told by one with whom he consulted, that by Merchandizing was a very probable way to effect it; He sold all his Goods and Patrimony, and with the Money, bought a Ship, furnished it with variety of Merchandise, and putting to Sea, he, by his Traffick in divers Countries, made such considerable Profit, that he returned home very Rich. Those who had known him before, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miring at so strange a Change, asked him, by what means he had acquired all that Wealth? He told them, 'twas by his Industry. After this, not being able to set Limits to his Covetous Desires, he must needs venture out to Sea again, where meeting with bad Weather, he, in a ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible Storm, lost his Ship, with all his Goods, and narrowly escaped in the Wrack, with his own Life. Being then asked by his Acquaintance, How he came to be reduced to that Low Ebb of
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:45842:173"/>
Poverty? I may thank, answered he, that Traytress Fortune for this Jadish Trick. Which Reproach when Fortune heard, she was angry, and appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to him: When thou, said she, hadst got toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a great Mass of Riches, thou gavest thy self the Glory of acquiring it; but layest on me the blame of this thy ill Success.</p>

These jealous Thoughts roused up his Courage within him; and strait this Magnanimous Warri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:45842:173"/>
directed his steps that way, whence he heard the terrible sound proceed. But when he appoach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Place, and beheld the clamarous Army of little Animals, that were able to form so great a Noise, he admired, and stopped his further progress.

What could this infinite Number of Little Creatures doe, now, contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible and unfit for all manner of Action, who yet make so horrid a Noise, if they had Bulk, strength and Heart given to each of them equal to mine? Whilst he was saying this, all that lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quacious Company, seeing so formidable a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture amongst them, were struck with a suddain Fear, fled, and hid thmselves in the impure Waters of their Melancholy Lake.</p>

               <p>GO, said a Country-man to his Son, take your Spade and dig the Field, that we may sowe it. The Son went out, but when he had viewed and considered the largeness of the Ground he was to work on, he was discouraged, thinking it impossible ever to be finished by one Man; and therefore concluded it better, to spare his pains than attempt an Impossibility. So laying himself down, he spent the day in Sleeping and Idleness.
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:45842:179"/>
The same thing he did the next, and the third day; But when his Father came to see what pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress he had made, and found the Field as yet undigg'd, he asked his Son, in what he had been employed, all that time. In nothing, answered he, for Alas! what could I alone do, towards the Digging such a Field as this? The Father per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving his Sons Error, prithee, said he, try but to Dig eight or ten Foot a Day. In this, the Son was content to obey his Father; and after a few days, seeing his Work go forwards pretty well, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to be pleased, and was encouraged to settle to it with all his Endeavours, whereby he finished his Undertaking to the great satisfaction of his Father.</p>

                  <hi>'Tis a difficult thing to make a just Computation of our undertakings before hand: For some Works may be done with as much ease, as measured. The Greek Proverb sayes <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, Principium dimidium totius. Incipe, dimidium qui caepit ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet. There is a great Difficulty in well disposing matters at first, for oftentimes that seems hard to accomplish, which is done with Ease. This shows also, that Mens Studies and Undertakings are much encouraged by a successful Beginning.</hi>

               <p>RAmbling over certain Fields, a Wolf found a parcel of Corn, which being no Meat for him, he left; travelling on further, but he met a Horse, whom he conducted to that place; and

there showing him the Barley: This I found, said he, and reserved on purpose for you, to have the pleasure of hearing you crump it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween your Teeth.

               <p>A Husband-man, about to rent a considerble Farm of <hi>Iupiter,</hi> refused to undertake it, unless he had these Conditions granted him in his Lease, <hi>viz.</hi> That he, at his Pleasure might go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern all the Seasons of the Year, when it should Rain, when Blow, be Hot Weather, Cold, Snow, or Frost, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This, after much pressing, <hi>Iupiter</hi> was content to grant; and the Country Man had what Weather soever he thought needfull, at his Desire. But when the Harvest should have come, there was neither Corne, Grapes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nor any other Product; for by the imprudent Manag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Husbandman, the Earth became Barren, and yeilded no manner of Fruit that year. The Poor Man at the Disapointment of his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected Crop, and loss of all his Labors, lamented and was extreamly sorrowful; which <hi>Iupiter</hi> saw, and willing to show him his Folly and Vanity,
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:45842:180"/>
who would pretend to know that better than himself, who knew all things so pefectly well. Friend, said he, you may, by this ill success, be sensible of your foolish Request, in making me govern the Seasons after your Discretion. But go your waies; now, Plow and Sowe; order your Vines and Fruit-trees, and make all other Preparations for the Year ensuing, which you were accusto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to do, leaving the Government of the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons to me for the future, to dispose them as I shall think fit; by which you shall see the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betwixt your Conduct and mine. This Advice the Man submitting to, had, the next Summer, a great Crop of Corn, a fruitful Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, and plenty of all things else, even beyond expectation; and seeing his own Folly, he left the care of Governing all future Seasons to <hi>Iupiter</hi>; wisely contenting himself with what Weather soever happened; and all his Husbandry suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded well and prosperously with him.</p>
               <p>
