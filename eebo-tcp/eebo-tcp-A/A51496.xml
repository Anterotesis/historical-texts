            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>AS Beauty in Distress has always found Protection
from the Generous and the Brave, to throw
herself into honorable Hands and hospitable
Walls, she seeks a Patron here; fearless even of greater
Dangers than those she has happily escap'd, when Your
condescending Goodness emboldens her to aspire to
Favours which her humble Thoughts wou'd scarce per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
her to expect. But while my fair Unfortunate rests
secure under so auspicious a Roof, my unhappier Hero
will inevitably be lost there: He'll find that Sweetness
of Temper, that Gracefulness, that Tenderness of
Soul, and every lovely Qualification so much above
him, that, where he enters with Pride, he will sit down
with Envy. He will find You dividing your equally
grateful Conversation betwixt the gravity of the Wise,
the gayety of the Witty, and the easy sprightliness of the
Fair, and entertaining the Solid, the Ingenious and the
Beauteous, so as to improve the first, cheer the second,
and charm the last. For, as none seems to have
more studied the Art of pleasing those whom the
Best deserving wou'd please, so a particular Genius of
Gallantry distinguishes You from most of those who
make any considerable Figure among the <hi>Beau monde.</hi>
You wisely consider that by such a Spirit the best Men
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:104583:3"/>
have been inspir'd with Sentiments productive of the
noblest Actions, and 'tis cheifly owing to such Examples
as Your self, that 'tis kept up in this degenerating Age,
when so many seem fondest of estranging themselves
from the most harmless Recreations and Improvements.
More happy those, who, like You, are convinc'd, that,
by a pleasing Converse with the other Sex, ours insen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly
gains that graceful Deportment, that elegant Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liteness,
and those Accomplishments which the ingenious
Fair seldom fail to impart more effectually than the most
lavish Nature itself, and even that Love of Glory,
which a desire to please 'em awakes or rather inspires in
Hearts. In that ingaging Society, Learning soon loses its
Pedantry, Youth its Indiscretion, and Bravery its
Roughness; and Man becomes with Ease and Pleasure
an absolute Master of those Graces that change a rude
Mass into a perfect Gentleman. But I ought not to dwell
on the Praise of others, while I have so fair an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
to enlarge on Yours. The Character which
You have still maintain'd, is what the ablest Pens might
be ambitious of Drawing; but what Colours of Speech
shall Rethoric, or Poetry it self, that bolder Paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
use, to do Justice to the great Original? If
like too many others you had need to borrow some
Glory from the reflected Lustre of your Ancestry, the
remotest Ages wou'd supply you with hereditary Marks
of Honor, while we trace up Yours long before the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest,
and find among the many noble Branches of so
Illustrious a Family, some of your Ancestors enriching
your Scutcheon in the Holy Wars by extraordinary At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievements
of Honour. and the acquisition of Laurels be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Walls of <hi>Jerusalem;</hi> and one particularly, killing
in single Combat the Champion of the <hi>Saracens</hi> before
the King and the whole Army, to the immortal Glory
of his Name and Country.</p>
            <p>But we need not look so far back as to Chronicles
and Monuments, when we have living Objects of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration;
<pb n="v" facs="tcp:104583:3"/>
before us Artful Painters, when they wou'd
copy such, endeavour to set every Perfection in its truest
light, and either to veil, extenuate, or throw into
shades those defects of which Nature is so seldom free;
they strive to heighten every grace, yet so as to preserve
the original Likeness, and give an advantageous Idea
of what they represent. While thus they flatter Nature,
I could only wish the first of these Talents, conscious
that I should have no occasion to exert the others, to
give a just Idea of your Accomplishments. But extror<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
Qualifications are yet more uneasily describ'd
to the Eyes of the Mind, than extraordinary Features to
those of the Body, and I have not so much of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor,
but that a Sense of Modesty and my own Incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city,
check my presumptuous Desires. Besides, even
Truth it self begins to cease to please the most deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,
when it makes too bold with their Praise; and the
illnatur'd World is apt to term that Flattery, which often
is but a just Acknowledgment, and the Incentive, and on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Reward of Vertue in this World; the want of Merit
of most Men making 'em displeased to hear the Worth
of others, and their Envy and uncharitable Thoughts
charging the fairest and most lively Complexions with
using Artifice. For my part, I hope never to seem so
imprudent as to debase with Flattery the real Worth
which I wou'd extol; I know that thus to add imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Virtue to the true, is like the injudicious laying paint
on a good Face, where some natural Beauty is wanting,
this only serves to disgrace the other Charms, and make
Deformity more conspicuous. Yet, without so much
as attemping a slight Sketch of your particular Endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
(tho most Poetical Dedications have more of the
Picture than of the Epistle) to whom shou'd aspiring
writers make their Court, but such as You, by whose
countenancing Generosity, Poetry, Music, and other
ingenious Arts are incourag'd? You, whose known Zeal
for those whom you espouse, and Humanity to all the
world, make every one fond of sharing your Smiles.
'Tis as You influence those whom we are proudest of
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:104583:4"/>
pleasing, that even our most labour'd Pieces must expect
to be receiv'd; and as You supply us with Instructions
and Examples, that we are enabled to succeed. 'Tis
not from the vulgar Order of men that we must learn to
write to the Heart, to touch the Soul, to trifle agreeably,
be witty without Affectation, solid without Dulness,
lofty without Bombast, and familiar without Meanness.</p>
            <p>But I ought to finish this Address, lest I usurp some
of those Moments which are due to your more enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
Diversions; and as the Business of this Epistle is
not more to secure to this Tragedy the Honour of your
Patronage, than to assure You of the deep Respect of
the Author, I cannot conclude better than with a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn
Protestation of being eternally, with the utmost
Veneration.</p>

            <head>The PREFACE.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> Have no reason to complain of the Reception which this Tragedy
met with, tho it appear'd first at a time not very favourable to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posures
of this kind, and divested of all the things that now recommend a
Play most to the Liking of the Many. For it has no Singing, no Danc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
no mixture of Comedy, no Mirth, no change of Scene, no rich
Dresses, no Show, no Rants, no Similies, no Battle, no Killing on the
Stage, no Ghost, no Prodigy; and, what's yet more, <hi>no Smut, no
Profaneness, nor Immorality.</hi> Besides: 'tis a single Plot, and the
whole Story, notwithstanding the great number of Turns in it, is trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted
on one individual spot of ground, and in no more Time than the
Representation takes up, which is an uncommon Confinement; the rather
if you consider that the Scenes are unbroken, no two and two coming on to
talk and then go out meerly because they had no more to say. Here I
study'd to bring the Actors to that Place only because they have Business
there, and make 'em go away because their concerns call for them else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where
yet never without leaving some Actor on, from the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
to the End of the Act. Add to this the Confinement in writing
to a Moral, the whole design tending to make good the last line in the
Poem; and the Difficulty in cloathing a Fiction like this with words that
may keep up the dignity of Verse, while the Tale requires all the Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
and natural Turn of Prose.</p>
            <p>I had the satisfaction of seeing the Audience pleasingly surpriz'd by the
Turns in the Plot; and if, as I am willing to believe, they came on some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
too fast, 'tis a Fault which I can with ease avoid another time.
Perhaps they only seem so now, because several things were left out, to
make the Play the shorter.</p>
            <p>Such as it is, it has had the honour of forcing Tears from the fairest
Eyes, and what I cannot too thankfully and humbly acknowledge, of
being the happy occasion of recommending me to Her Royal Highnesses
Bounty; Her Princely Gift alone outweighing the Benefit of a sixth Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentation:
This most excellent and pious Princess being pleas'd to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
thus an inoffensive Writer, doubtless that he may still keep to strict
Morality, even in the circumstances of a melancholic Fortune.</p>
            <p>I might say something now of the present Disputes about the Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness
or Unlawfulnes: of the Stage, but refer you to the following Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
which (as the Booksellers, who are men of fair and unquestion'd
Reputation, and above countenancing any little trick, can testifie) was
really writ by a worthy Divine of the Church of <hi>England.</hi>

I cannot be too cautious; for I find my uninterrupted good success has
rais'd me Enemies. But, since 'tis common for better Pens than my
self to be abus'd by the worst, as long as my Writings continue to be as
well receiv'd as they have been from the first, I can calmly leave Envy
and Detraction in their deserv'd Obscurity.</p>
            <p>I only beg leave to add the following lines, out of a Poem which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

            <head>A LETTER
FROM A
Divine of the CHURCH of ENGLAND,
To the Author of the TRAGEDY call'd,
BEAVTY in DISTRESS,
Concerning the Lawfulness and Unlawfulness of Plays.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>SINCE you have been pleas'd to desire my Opinion about the lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
or unlawfulness of writing Plays for the Stage, I shall give it
you with all the Freedom and Impartiality which becomes one of my
Function. Vpon reflecting on the present Management of our Thea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
on the Actions, Humors, and Characters which are daily represented there,
which are for the most part so Leud and Immodest, as to tend very much to
the debauching the Youth and Gentry of our English Nation; I might very
well diswade you from giving any Countenance to such unmanly Practices,
by offering any of your Works to the service of the Stage.</p>
            <p>But tho the <hi>Theatral</hi> Representations are become an Offence and Scandal
to most, yet I am not of their Mind, who think Plays are absolutely unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
and the best way to <hi>Reform</hi> is wholly to suppress them: For certainly
they might be of very great use, not only for the Diversion and Pleasure, but
also for the correction and information of Mankind. 'Tis no Crime to eat
or drink, but the Sin lies in the excessive and immoderate Vse, or rather a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buse
of those things which we either eat or drink: the Case is much the same
with Plays. In their own Nature they are innocent and harmless Diversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
but then indeed they become sinful and unlawful, to be made, acted, or
seen, when they transgress the bounds of Virtue and Religion; shock our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
put our Modesty to the blush; imprint nauseous and unbecoming Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
on our Minds; and in a word, when they are such as are a scandal to
the Author, and an offence to the Audience.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="x" facs="tcp:104583:6"/>
I am not willing (<hi>Sir</hi>) to believe so hardly of the Age, (tho 'tis bad e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
in all Conscience) but that most of the Persons who frequent the The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atres,
would be as well pleas'd to see a Play of Decorum and Modesty acted,
as they would be to see a leud and Atheistical Comedy. 'Tis upon this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration
that I am willing to encourage you in your design of writing Plays
for the Stage; for you have too much Prudence, Honour, and Conscience,
to subject the <hi>sacred Nine</hi> to base and servile ends. 'Tis to be hop'd that
such as you may be a means of reforming the Abuses of the Stage, and of
shewing the World that a Poet may be a man of Sense and Parts, without
renouncing his Virtue.</p>
            <p>I shall not trouble you at present with any farther Thoughts of my own,
but will here give you the sentiments of a very judicious Divine upon this
Subject. It seems he was consulted by a Gentleman, whether Plays were
lawful or not, and whether he might in Conscience exercise his Parts that
way: To this the Divine replies in the ensuing Letter, shewing how far
Plays are lawful and necessary, and when they become unlawful and sinful;
the Resolution of this will, I presume, come up to your Purpose.</p>
            <floatingText type="letter">
               <body>
                  <head>The LETTER is as follows.</head>
                  <opener>
                     <salute>SIR,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>I Have avoided as much as I could giving you my Opinion in writing
about Plays, considering the niceness of the Subject, and my own
Incapacity: But since you press me still to cure you of that scrupu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
Fear which lies upon your Mind, I must pass over those two Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties,
chusing rather to expose my self on your account, than not
to ease you of your Doubts. In truth, <hi>Sir,</hi> the more I examine the
Holy Fathers, the more I read the Divines, and consult the Casuists,
the less able I find my self to determin any thing in this matter. I
had no sooner found something in favour of the <hi>Drama</hi> among the
Schoolmen, who are almost all of them for allowing it, but I perceiv'd
my self surrounded with abundance of passages out of the Councils
and the Fathers, who have all of them declaim'd against publick Shows.</p>
                  <p>This Question would have been soon determin'd, if the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
had said any thing about it. But as <hi>Tertullian</hi> very well observes,
We no where find that we are as expresly forbidden in Scripture to
go to the <hi>Circus</hi> and <hi>Theatre,</hi> to see the fightings of <hi>Gladiators,</hi> or be
assisting in any Show, as we are forbid to worship Idols, or the being
guilty of Murder, Treason and Adultery. If you read the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
over and over, you will never meet with any express and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
precept against Plays. The Fathers assert that we cannot in
Conscience be any ways assisting to the <hi>Drama;</hi> the Schoolmen main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
the contrary: Let us therefore endeavour to make use of St.
<pb n="xi" facs="tcp:104583:6"/>
                     <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s Rule, who says, <hi>That Reason is to be heard where Holy Writ is
silent;</hi> and let us try to reconcile the conclusions of the Divines with
the determination of the Fathers of the Church.</p>
                  <p>But because 'tis a very nice Point, and the question consists in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciling
them together, I will not advance any thing of my own
Sentiments, but bring St. <hi>Thomas Aquinas</hi> to speak for me; who
being on one side a very Religious Father, and Holy Doctor of the
Church, and on the other side, the Angel of the School, the Master
and Head of all the Divines, seems to me the most proper of any to
reconcile the disagreeing Opinions of both parties. In the second
part of his <hi>Summs,</hi> among others, he starts this Question, What we
ought to think of Sports and Diversions? And he returns in answer
to himself, That provided they be moderate, he does not only not
think them sinful, but in some measure good and conformable to that
Virtue which <hi>Aristotle</hi> stiles <hi>Eutrapelia,</hi> whose business 'tis to set just
bounds to our Pleasures. The reason which he alledges for it is this,
That a man being fatigu'd by the serious actions of Life, has need
of an agreeable Refreshment, which he can find no where so well as
in Plays: and to back his Opinion, that great Casuist produces that
of St. <hi>Augustin</hi> in his own words, <q>In short, I would have you take
care of your self, for 'tis the part of a Wise man, sometimes to
unbend his Mind which is too intent upon his Bussness.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>Now, continues St. <hi>Thomas,</hi> How can this relaxation of the Mind
be effected, if not by diverting Words or Actions? 'Tis not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
sinful or unbecoming a wise and virtuous Man, to allow him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
some innocent Pleasures.</q> This holy Doctor does even in some
sort reckon it a Sin to refrain from Diversion; <q>Because (says he)
whatever is contrary to Reason, is vicious; now 'tis contrary to
Reason that a man should be so unsociable and hard upon others, as
to oppose their innocent Pleasures, never to bear a part in their
Diversions, or contribute to 'em by his Words or Actions. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Seneca</hi> had a great deal of reason to say upon this occasion,
Demean your selves in your Conversation with so much Prudence
and Discretion, that none may charge you with being morose, or
despise you as one unfit for human Converse: for 'tis a Vice to fall
out with all Mankind, and thus to be imputed a morose and salvage
Creature.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>'Tis easy, <hi>Sir,</hi> to determine from those words of that Father,
that under the general term of Recreations he comprehends the
<hi>Drama,</hi> when he says, that this unbending of the Mind, which is a
Virtue, is perform'd by diverting Words and Actions. Now what
is more proper and peculiar to Plays than this, since they only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
in jocose and witty Words and Actions, such as produce delight
<pb n="xii" facs="tcp:104583:7"/>
and recreate the mind? I do not think you will find in any other Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version,
Words and Actions thus united together. But hearken, I
beseech you, once more to this great Scholar.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>It seems (says he) as if those Players who spend their whole
lives on the Stage, did transgress the bounds of innocent Diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.
If then excessive Diversion be a Sin (as certainly 'tis) the
Players are in a state of Sin; and so likewise are all those who
assist at Stage-representations, and they who give any thing to
them are, as it were, Abetters of their Sin; which seems to be
false; for we read in the Lives of the Fathers, that one day it was
reveal'd to St. <hi>Paphnutius,</hi> That in the other Life he should not
arrive to a higher degree of Glory than a certain Player.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>If the Objection which St. <hi>Thomas</hi> here starts be nice, his Answer
is as delicate and solid. <q>Diversion (replys this excellent Doctor)
being therefore necessary for the comfort of human Life, we may
appoint several Employments for this very end, which are lawful.
Thus the Employment of Players being established to afford men
an honest Recreation, has nothing in it, in my mind, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves
to be prohibited; and I do not look upon them to be in a
state of Sin, provided they make use of this sort of Recreation
with moderation, that is, provided they neither speak nor act any
thing which is unlawful; mix nothing that is Sacred with Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane,
and never act in a prohibited time. And tho they may
have no other employment of Life, with respect to other Men,
yet with respect to themselves and to God, they have other very
serious Employments, such as when they pray to God, govern
their Passions, and give Alms to the Poor. From hence I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
that those who in moderation pay or assist them are guilty
of no Sin, but do an act of justice, since they only give them the
reward of their labour. But if any one should squander away
his whole Estate upon them, or countenance Players who act after
a scandalous and unlawful way, I make no question but that he
sins, and gives them encouragement to sin; and 'tis in this sense
that St. <hi>Augustin</hi>'s words are to be taken, when he says, <hi>That to
give one's Estate away to Players, is rather a Vice than a Virtue.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>To prove that 'tis only the Excess which ought to be condemned in
all Sports and Diversions, and that the holy Fathers had no other
design in declaiming against Plays, St. <hi>Thomas</hi> explains what he
means by Excess, and lays it down as an indispensible Maxim,
That in every thing which may be regulated according to Reason,
that which transgresses this Rule is to be reckon'd superfluous, and
that which does not come up to it defective. <q>Now, continues he,
diverting Words and Actions may be regulated according to Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son:
<pb n="xiii" facs="tcp:104583:7"/>
The Excess therefore in them is, when they do not agree to
this Rule, or are defective by the Circumstances which ought to
be applied to them.</q> 'Tis upon this Maxim that we ought to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
answer to the Authorities of the Fathers of the Church, since
according to St. <hi>Thomas,</hi> they declaim only against the Excess in
Plays, and we shall offer nothing on this subject, but in imitation
of this great Doctor, who, as his way was, applying to all the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
the Answer which he gives to only one, answers St. <hi>Chrysostom</hi>
in this manner. That eloquent Father had said, that it was not
God who was the Author of Sports, but the Devil; and the more
to back what he had advanc'd, produc'd this passage out of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Writ; <hi>The people sat down to eat and drink, and rose up to play.</hi> But
St. <hi>Thomas</hi> is for having those words of the great <hi>Chrysostom,</hi> to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
of excessive and immoderate Sports; and he adds, That Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
in play is a foolish pleasure, stil'd by St. <hi>Gregory</hi> the Daughter of
Gluttony and Sin; and that in this sense it is written, that <hi>the people
sat down to eat and drink, and rose up to play.</hi> This is the Answer
which we are to make to whatever may be objected against us out of
the Fathers, and the rather, because in examining them without pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice,
'tis easy to perceive, that if they did declaim so much against
the <hi>Drama,</hi> it was only because in their times its Excess was crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
and immoderate; whereas had they seen it as 'tis now-a-days in
<hi>France,</hi> conformable to good Manners and right Reason, they would
not have inveigh'd against it. But Plays as they were acted in the
time of our Forefathers, were so abominable and infamous, that those
Pious men could not but employ their greatest Zeal against a thing
which was so very offensive to the Church. For is it not the excess of
Plays, for instance, against which <hi>Tertullian</hi> cries out, when he says;
<q>Let us not go to the Theatre, which is a particular Scene of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modesty
and Debauchery, where nothing is lik'd but what is dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>approv'd
elsewhere; and what is thought most excellent, is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
what is infamous and lewd. A Player, for instance, acts
there with the most shameful and naked Gestures; Women for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting
the modesty of their Sex, dare do that on the Stage, and
in the view of all the World, which others would blush to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
at home where no body could see them. There they repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
the Rape of Virgins, the infamous Victims of publick De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauchery;
so much the more wretched, because expos'd to the
view of such Women as are suppos'd to be ignorant of such Licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiousness.
They are there made the subject of the young mens
mirth; there you are directed to the place where they prostitute
themselves; there they tell you how much they get by their infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
Trade, and there in a word those Strumpets are commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="xiv" facs="tcp:104583:8"/>
in the presence of those who ought to be ignorant of all those
things. I say nothing, adds this Father, of what ought to be bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
in eternal silence, for fear that by barely mentioning such
horrid Actions, I should in some measure be guilty of them.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>But the other Fathers are not so reserv'd as he, and make no scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
to discover all they know about it. You must not imagine that
I am ambitious of quoting all they have said: Those matters which
are so freely handled in another Language, might prove offensive in
ours; therefore I will only leave you to guess what Exorbitances
they have mention'd, by some of those lesser Infamies of which I dare
give an account out of their Writings.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Salvian</hi> was afraid to say any thing about it: <q>Who (says he)
can treat of those shameful Representations, those dishonest
Speeches, and of those lascivious and immodest Actions, the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>normity
and offence of which are discoverable by that restraint
which they in their own nature impose upon us not to rehearse
them?</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Lactantius</hi> is not so reserv'd, his most favourable Thoughts about
it are these. <q>To what end do those impudent Actions of the
Players tend, but to debauch the Youth of the Age? Their effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate
Bodies in Womens dresses, represent the most lascivious
Gestures of the most dissolute. And a little lower, he says,
From the licentiousness of Speech, they proceed to that of Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
they, at the instance of the people, strip, debauch'd Women
stark naked on the publick Theatre, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </q> Pray be you Judge, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
what this Father adds, can be acceptable to modesty.</p>
                  <p>St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> who <hi>ex professo</hi> composed a Book of publick Shows,
describes at large all the infamous Practices there. We may also
read something of that abominable Custom of their appearing naked
on the Theatres, in St. <hi>Chrysostom,</hi> St. <hi>Jerom,</hi> and St. <hi>Augustin.</hi>
The first of these does not scruple comparing those of his time who
went to Plays to <hi>David,</hi> who took pleasure in seeing <hi>Bathsheba</hi> naked
in her Bath; and saying that the Theatre is the Rendevouz of all
manner of Debaucheries, that 'tis full of Impudence, Abomination,
and Impiety. A more modern Writer (viz. <hi>Alexander</hi> ab <hi>Alexandro</hi>)
describing the Shows of the <hi>Antients,</hi> and especially their <hi>Bacchanalia,</hi>
gives us such horrible Pictures of their publick Infamies and Prostitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
that I should tremble to repeat them. You may imagin,
<hi>Sir,</hi> there could be nothing of good in them, since the infamous
<hi>Heliogabalus</hi> was the Author of some of them. But lest you
should suppose that Plays were much the same as they are now; and
that 'twas only to disswade the faithful from frequenting the
Stage, that the Fathers represented it in such frightful Colours;
<pb n="xv" facs="tcp:104583:8"/>
let us consult profane Authors. <hi>Valerius Maximus,</hi> speaking of
the detestable Custom which the <hi>Romans</hi> had, of exposing upon the
Theatre the naked Bodies of debauch'd Women, and the naked Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
of young Boys, relates of <hi>M. P. Cato,</hi> that he being one day at
those sights, and understanding by his Favourite <hi>Favonius,</hi> that out of
the Respect which they bore to him, the People were asham'd to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
the Players should appear naked on the Theatre; this great man
withdrew, that he might not by his presence hinder that which was
so customary. <hi>Seneca</hi> gives us the same Account of <hi>Cato,</hi> and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends
him for his being unwilling to see those debauch'd Women na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked.
I dare not repeat to you the words of <hi>Lampridius,</hi> because they
are too fulsom, when he says, that the Emperor <hi>Heliogabalus,</hi> who in
a Play represented <hi>Venus,</hi> showed himself all naked upon the Stage
with the utmost signs of Impudence. We also find that the public
Shows of the Antients were as dreadfully impious, as they were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moral.
<q>There (says St. <hi>Chrysostom</hi>) they blaspheme the Name of
God, and no sooner have the Players vented a blasphemous Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression,
but a loud Applause follows. This is what oblig'd the
third Council of <hi>Carthage</hi> by a Canon to condemn Players as
Blasphemers: Let not the Laicks themselves be present at the
Shows, for it has been always unlawful for any Christian to go in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Company of Blasphemers.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now who would not cry down the Stage, if it were so full of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morality
and Profaneness? There is no need of being one of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
the Light of Nature is sufficient to condemn so great an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess.
Thus we read in St. <hi>Chrysostom,</hi> 
                     <q>That certain <hi>Barbarians</hi>
having heard of those Theatral Plays, express'd themselves in those
terms worthy of the greatest Philosophers, <hi>viz.</hi> 'Tis fit that the
<hi>Romans,</hi> when they invented this kind of Pleasures, should be
look'd upon as Persons who had neither Wives nor Children.</q> And
<hi>Alcibiades</hi> among other things is commended for having cast a certain
Comedian, nam'd <hi>Eupolis,</hi> into the Sea, for being so impudent as to
repeat some infamous Verses in his presence, adding at his Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
this Expression, Thou hast plung'd me often in the debauche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
of the Stage, and for once I will plunge thee into the depths of
the Sea.</p>
                  <p>You may easily perceive, <hi>Sir,</hi> that all those passages out of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
and a thousand others which I could produce out of them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
Stage-Plays, prove nothing against the <hi>Drama</hi> as it now stands
in <hi>France.</hi> It would be superfluous to stand making a Comparison
between the one and the other; I desire that you would only take
notice, that far from weakning the Doctrine of St. <hi>Thomas,</hi> all that
has been hitherto alledg'd serves only to strengthen it: For 'tis only
<pb n="xvi" facs="tcp:104583:9"/>
against the Excess of the Stage that the Fathers appear'd so zealous,
whereas if they had found it divested of those unhappy Circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
which then attended it, they would have been of St. <hi>Thomas</hi>'s
Opinion, and at least have look'd upon it as indifferent.</p>
                  <p>I thought it proper to relate all this to you before I ventur'd to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
my own Thoughts on this Subject; and upon those indisputable
Principles which I have laid down, I affirm, that in my Judgment,
Plays in their own Nature, and taken in themselves, independent from
any other Circumstance whether good or bad, ought to be reckon'd
among the number of things purely indifferent. Upon due exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
you will find it to be the Opinion even of <hi>Tertullian</hi> and St.
<hi>Cyprian,</hi> the two who seem to declaim most against the <hi>Drama.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To begin with <hi>Tertullian,</hi> at the same time that he abominates the
infamy of publick Shows, he starts this Objection to himself: <q>God
(says he) has made all things, and given them to men, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
they are all good, such as the <hi>Circus,</hi> Lions, Voices, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
What then makes the use of them unlawful?</q> To this he answers,
That 'tis true, all things were instituted by God, but that they
were corrupted by the evil Spirit: That Iron, for instance, is as
much God's Creature as Plants and Angels; that notwithstanding this,
God did not make these Creatures to be instruments of Murder, Poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
and Magick, tho men by their Wickedness deprave them to
those Uses; and that what renders a great many things evil, which
in their own nature are indifferent, is not their Institution but Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption.
From hence, if we apply this way of arguing to publick
Shows, it follows, that consider'd in their own nature, they are as
harmless as Angels, Plants, and Iron; but that 'tis the evil Spirit
that has chang'd, perverted, and spoil'd 'em. You see then that
<hi>Tertullian</hi> has reckon'd Stage-Plays among indifferent Actions, and
that what he condemns in them is only the Excess.</p>
                  <p>St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> speaking of <hi>David</hi>'s dancing before the Ark, owns that
there is no harm in dancing or singing; but yet, says he, this is no
excuse for Christians, who are present at those lascivious Dances and
impure Songs, which are in honour of Idols. Whence 'tis easy for
you to infer, that this holy Doctor does not absolutely condemn
Dancing, Singing, Operas, and Comedies, but only those Shows that
represented Fables after the lascivious manner of the Greeks and
Romans, and which were celebrated in honour of Idols. This is
likewise St. <hi>Bonaventure</hi>'s Opinion, who says expresly, <q>That shows
are good and lawful if they are attended with necessary Precauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and Circumstances. </q>The great <hi>Albertus</hi> his Master taught him
this Doctrine: and the words which I met with upon this Subject in
St. <hi>Antoninus,</hi> Archbishop of <hi>Florence,</hi> are so pertinent that I cannot for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear
<pb n="xvii" facs="tcp:104583:9"/>
inserting them here. <q>The profession of a Comedian (says
he) because it is useful for the Diversion of men which is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site,
is not forbidden in its own nature: from whence it follows,
that it is no less lawful to get one's Livelihood by this Art,  <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </q>
And in another place, <q>Comedy is a mixture of pleasant Speeches
and Actions, for the Diversion of a mans self, or for that of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
If nothing is mix'd in it either unbecoming, or an Affront
to God, or prejudicial to one's Neighbour, 'tis an effect of that
Virtue which is call'd <hi>Eutrapelia;</hi> for the Mind which is fatigu'd
by internal Cares, as the Body is by external Labour, has as much
need of Repose as the Body has of Nourishment. This Repose
is procur'd by those kind of diverting Speeches and Actions which
are call'd Plays.</q> Can any thing, <hi>Sir,</hi> be said of greater weight
in favour of Comedy? Yet he who says it, is a Man of undoubted
sanctity: How comes it to pass that he does not declaim as loudly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
it, as the Antients did? 'Tis because the <hi>Drama</hi> grows more
correct and perfect every day; and I have observ'd in reading the
Holy Fathers, that the nearer they come to our times, the more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable
they are to Plays, because the Stage was not so licentious as
before. Thus likewise we see, that it is not prohibited by the Saint of
our times, the great <hi>Francis de Sales,</hi> who might without dispute serve
as a pattern to all Directors. And <hi>Fontana de Ferrara</hi> in his Institutes
relates, That the famous Saint, <hi>Charles Borromeus,</hi> allow'd Stage-Plays
in his Diocess, by an Order in the year 1583. yet upon condition,
that before they were acted they should be revis'd and licens'd by
his grand Vicar, for fear any thing which is immodest should be in
them. This pious and learned Cardinal did then allow of modest
Comedies, and condemn'd only the Immodest and Profane, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
by the third Council which he held at <hi>Milan</hi> in the year
1572.</p>
                  <p>Beside this multitude of Testimonies which are in my favour,
I might likewise form a strong Proof taken from the Words and
Practice of the Holy Fathers in general, and observe that those
who have cry'd out so mightily against the Stage, have been as
violent in declaiming against playing at Cards, Dice, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> They
have inveigh'd against Banquets and Feasts, against Luxury and
gaudy Dresses, against lofty Buildings, magnificent Houses, rich
Furniture, rare Painting, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> St. <hi>Chrysostom</hi> has whole Homilies up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this Subject: we find a particular Catalogue of them in the
<hi>Pedagogue</hi> of St. <hi>Clement Alexandrinus:</hi> St. <hi>Augustin</hi> treats very
largely of them in most of his Works, and particularly in his
Letter to <hi>Possidonius.</hi> St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> quoted by the same St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustin,</hi>
St. <hi>Gregory,</hi> in a word, all the Fathers have warmly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim'd
<pb n="xviii" facs="tcp:104583:10"/>
claim'd against the luxury and richness of Apparel; some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
exciting us to follow the Example of St. <hi>John Baptist,</hi> who
for the Austerity of his Life was so highly commended by our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour.
And yet we find that they did not raise so many doubts of
Conscience in mens Minds upon this score, as they did upon the
account of Stage-Plays; and none made a scruple either of wear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Habits sutable to their Quality, nor of living at ease, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
they did it within the compass of Modesty and Moderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Why then should we not extend this Indulgence to Shows,
and affirm, that as the Reproaches of the Doctors of the Church
are applicable to Luxury, Intemperance, and Prodigality, but not
to the innocent and moderate use of the good things of this Life,
so we may interpret their words of immoral and profane Plays,
but not of those that do not transgress the Rules of Prudence
and Morality?</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>To prove (says <hi>Albertus Magnus</hi>) that the Scripture does not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
Plays, Dancing, and Shows, consider'd singly, and without
those offensive Circumstances which make them condemnable; do
not we read in <hi>Exodus, That</hi> Miriam <hi>the Prophetess, the Sister of</hi>
Aaron, <hi>took a Timbrel in her hand, and all the Women went out af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
her with Timbrels and with Dances,</hi> Exod. 15. 20? Does not the
Royal Prophet say (<hi>Psal.</hi> 68. 25, 27.) That <hi>Benjamin</hi> was among
the Damsels who played with Timbrels? Nay, does not God
himself, by the Mouth of <hi>Jeremiah, Chap.</hi> 31. 4. promise the
Jews, that upon their return from <hi>Chaldee,</hi> they should play up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Timbrels, and go forth in the Dances of them that make
merry? Therefore (concludes <hi>Albertus Magnus</hi>) Dances and
Pleasures are not in themselves sinful or unlawful, but made so
by the criminal Circumstances added to them: and I would not
enjoin a Penitent to abstain from them, since God himself
not only permits, but promises them.</q> And indeed take away
the Excess which may possibly creep into <hi>Dramatick</hi> Represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,
and I know no harm in them: For 'tis a kind of speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Picture, wherein are represented Histories or Fables for the
Diversion, and very often for the Instruction of men.</p>
                  <p>Hitherto we find nothing amiss in the Design of the Stage; but
perhaps its enemies will object, that it must needs be bad however,
because 'tis prohibited. I protest, <hi>Sir,</hi> I never yet thought the
Prohibition of any thing made it sinful, but on the contrary, that
the Viciousness of it made it to be prohibited. But let us consult
those places of Scripture which seem to forbid Plays, and such
like Shows, and try to explain them, not as we please, but by the
words of the greatest Doctors. <hi>Albertus Magnus,</hi> who has col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected
<pb n="xix" facs="tcp:104583:10"/>
all those Passages, shall give us the Explanation of them.
The first which he mentions is that of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> who seems to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
all those Sports to immodesty; for the Apostle exhorting men
to avoid that Sin, expresses himself thus, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. As some of
them fell into Impurity, of whom it is written, <hi>The People sat down
to eat and drink, and rose up to play.</hi> The second is taken out of
<hi>Exodus, Chap.</hi> 32. where we find that Dances were first invented
before Idols; and by this they prove that 'tis an idolatrous Institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
to excite men to impurity. The third is that of <hi>Isaiah, Chap.</hi> 3.
who in the Name of God denounces great Threatnings against
those kind of Sports; <hi>Because the Daughters of</hi> Zion <hi>are haughty, and
walk with stretched forth Necks, and wanton Eyes, walking and tripping
as they go, and making a tinkling with their Feet: Therefore the Lord
will smite with a scab the crown of the Head of the Daughters of</hi> Zion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
And lastly, 'tis pretended that St. <hi>Paul</hi> includes all publick Sights
in those famous words, 1 Thess. 5. 22. <hi>Abstain from all appearance
of Evil.</hi> But <hi>Albertus Magnus</hi> returns this Reply to all those Passages,
<q>That Dancing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which are not in their own nature evil,
may become so by being attended with those unhappy Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
which St. <hi>Paul</hi> is to be understood to speak of: That 'tis
false to assert that they never danc'd but before Idols; and that
it has been done upon other occasions, witness <hi>Miriam</hi> the Sister
of <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> whom we formerly mention'd: That God
by the Mouth of his Prophet, reproves only those impudent Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stures,
with which the dancing of the <hi>Jews</hi> was attended. And
lastly, That St. <hi>Paul</hi> forbids even the appearance of real Evil, and
not of that which may become so by Accident and bad Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>But you will say, If Plays are good in themselves, why are the
Actors of them noted with Infamy in <hi>Justinian</hi>'s Institutes? But
pray let me ask you a Question or two; Does that Soldier sin who
runs away in Battel for fear of being kill'd? Or does a young Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow,
who cannot live single, commit a mortal Sin by marrying
a second Husband before her year is up? and yet the same Book
brands both of them with a note of Infamy, and a thousand other
Persons whose Actions are not criminal. 'Tis therefore a very
weak Consequence to prove the sinfulness of an Action, because
'tis noted as infamous: Suppose it true, that Players were infamous
by acting on the Stage, I would fain know why the Youth of the
Universities, and other Persons very prudent, and sometimes of the
best Quality, who for their own Diversion, and without scandal act
Parts in Play, are not as infamous as the common Players. I hope
none will say, 'tis because the latter act to get by it, whereas the
<pb n="xx" facs="tcp:104583:11"/>
others do it for their Diversion, for that is a very wretched Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
Suppose any Action be evil in it self, what signifies it whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
a Man gets by it or no? It will still be evil, and no Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
can alter its nature: So that as a perjur'd Man, or a Calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niator,
branded with Infamy by the Law you cited, will be always
infamous, let them be in what circumstances soever; so Plays cannot
be represented upon any occasion or motive whatever, without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring
the stain of Infamy, which you say is cast upon it. But to
understand the meaning of the Laws, 'tis requisite to have recourse
to those Doctors who have expounded them. Pray see what the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
<hi>Baldus</hi> says on this Subject; <q>The Players who act in a modest
way, either to divert themselves or please others, and who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
nothing against good Manners, are not to be reputed infamous.</q>
You perceive then according to this Commentator, that the Infamy
falls only on those who act infamous Plays.</p>
                  <p>Since time changes every thing, Men of Equity ought to consider
things in the time wherein they are. Were not the Physicians them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
turn'd out of <hi>Rome</hi> as infamous Persons? And in the esteem
wherein now they are, is there the least sign of their Infamy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining?
Why then should any Reflection stick on so ingenious a
Profession, which in <hi>France</hi> (and perhaps elsewhere) is become ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the School of Virtue than that of Vice? The reason why for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
Players were declar'd infamous, was the Infamy so predominant
in the Plays which they acted, and the Infamy which they themselves
added to it by their shameful way of acting. But now since that
Reason is out of doors, without doubt its Consequences are abolish'd;
and if any Consequences are to be drawn from it, 'tis that Plays be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
altogether unblameable, those who act them, provided they
live honestly, ought not to be reckon'd among the number of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honourable
Persons. This is so far true, that the being a Player does
not degrade any Man's Quality. <hi>Floridor,</hi> who is said to have been the
greatest Player <hi>France</hi> ever had, being a Gentleman by Birth, was
not judg'd unworthy of that Title upon the account of his Profession:
And when enquiry was made about the false Nobless, he was admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by the King and Council to make out the truth of his, which by
right of Inheritance descended to his Posterity. Those of the <hi>Opera,</hi>
if born Gentlemen, by the establishment of that Academy of Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick,
are not to lose their Quality: Now are there Prerogatives for
the one which are not to be allow'd the other? And if there be any
distinction between them, have not all Ages determin'd it in favor
of Comedy, since by the consent of all Nations, Poetry is the elder
Sister of Musick?</p>
                  <p>Several Doctors (you say) or at least such as pretend to be so,
<pb n="xxi" facs="tcp:104583:11"/>
have shown you certain Rituals, which forbid the Confessors to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minister
the Sacraments to Players, which they confirm by the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of several Councils. To this I answer, That those Rituals,
and the Canons of those Councils, only mean it of such Players who
act scandalous pieces, or who act them immodestly. But let those
People tell you what difference they make between Stage-plays and
other kinds of Sports; for as to the Rituals, the Canons, the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> they make none, but equally prohibit them all. Yet your
Doctors who talk so loudly of the Fathers and Councils, do not so
scrupulously follow their Decisions against Gaming and other Sports.
We find that the Abbots, Priests, Bishops and Ecclesiasticks make
no difficulty of playing, and pretend that all the Censures of the
Fathers ought to be understood of the excess in Sports, and not of
those which are moderate, and us'd without much application to pass
away a little time. Why then should not the same thing be urg'd,
and the same Indulgence allow'd in behalf of Plays, since we find
such a Dispensation with respect to other Sports? Besides, should you
ask the Bishops and Prelates what they think of Plays, they would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare,
that when they are modest, and have nothing in them which
wounds Morality and Christianity, they do not pretend to censure
them. And even if they were silent in the case, one may guess at
their Opinion by their Conduct, since in those very Diocesses where
those severe Rituals are us'd, Plays are acted, tolerated, and perhaps
approv'd. If they are bad, why are they tolerated? As they are
acted at <hi>Paris,</hi> I see no fault in them. 'Tis true, I cannot pass a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitive
Judgment upon them, since I never go to see them: But there
are three very easy ways of knowing what is done at the Theatres,
and I acknowledg that I have made use of all three. The first is to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
one self of it by Men of Parts and Probity, who out of that hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
they have to Sin, would not allow themselves to be present at those
sort of Shows, if sinful. The next is, to judg by the Confessions of
those who go thither of the evil Effects which Plays produce upon
their Minds. The third is the reading of the Plays: and I protest
that by these ways I have not been able to discover the least appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of the excess which the Fathers with so much Justice condemn'd
in Plays. A world of People of eminent Virtue, and of a very nice,
not to say scrupulous Conscience, have been forced to own to me that
the Plays on the French Theatre are at present so pure, that there is
nothing in them which can offend the chastest Ear: Every day at
Court the Bishops, Cardinals, and Nuncio's of the Pope make no
scruple to be present at them; and it would be no less Impudence
than Folly, to conclude that all those great Prelates are profane Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertines,
since they authorize the Crime by their presence. 'Tis ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="xxii" facs="tcp:104583:12"/>
a sign that the Plays are so pure and regular, that none need be
asham'd or afraid to see them. I have likewise sometimes made a
Reflection (which to me seems of some weight.) Upon casting my
Eyes on the Bills pasted up at the corners of Streets, wherein all
manner of Persons are invited to come to the Plays which are acted
by the King's Authority, and by his Majesty's Servants: I thought
to my self, if they invited People to some bad Action, to be in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous
places, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 'tis certain that the Magistrates would be so far
from allowing the publication of those Bills, that they would severe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
punish the Authors of them, who abus'd the King's Authority,
by inviting his good Subjects to the commission of such Enormities.
Therefore concluded I, 'tis plain that Plays are not so bad, since the
Magistrates do not put them down, nor the Prelates make any oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
to them, and since they act by the privilege of a religious Prince,
who would not by his presence authorize a Crime, of which he
would be more guilty than others.</p>
                  <p>As to Confessions, I could never by their means find out this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
mischief of Plays: For if it were the source of so many Crimes,
it would from thence follow that the Rich who frequent the Theatres,
would be the greatest Sinners; and yet we find that 'tis pretty equal,
and that the Poor who never saw a Play are as guilty as the Rich of
Anger, Revenge, Uncleanness, and Pride. I would therefore ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
conclude, and that with some reason too, that those Sins are
the effects of human Weakness or Malice, which take an occasion of
sinning from all manner of Objects indifferently.</p>
                  <p>As to the reading of the Plays which are now acted in <hi>France,</hi> I
never could find in those I have perus'd, any thing which could any
ways offend Christianity or good Manners. The greatest fault that
can be found in them is, that most of the Subjects are taken out of
Fables; and yet what harm is there in that? <q>They are such Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
out of which may be taken very fine Instructions of Morality,
capable of inspiring Men with a love of Virtue, and a detestation
of Vice.</q> These are the words of a very great Man (<hi>Peter</hi> Bishop
of <hi>Blois</hi>) who maintains, <q>That 'tis lawful to extract Truths out
of Heathen Fables, and that 'tis no more than receiving Arms
from our very Enemies.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>To leave nothing unresolv'd, let me examin the Precautions which
the Doctors give us in going to a Play. As to the lawfulness of the
<hi>Drama,</hi> St. <hi>Thomas,</hi> St. <hi>Bonaventure,</hi> St. <hi>Antonine,</hi> and above all
<hi>Albertus Magnus</hi> has said that in all Sports we ought to take care of
three things. The first is, that we should not seek for Pleasure in
immodest Words or Actions, as they did in the times of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients;
an unhappy Custom which <hi>Cicero</hi> laments in these words:
<pb n="xxiii" facs="tcp:104583:12"/>
There is a kind of jesting which is sordid, insolent, wicked, and
obscene. The second thing we are to take care of, says <hi>Albertus,</hi>
is, that when we would refresh our Spirits, we should not entirely
lose the Gravity of the Soul, which gives St. <hi>Ambrose</hi> occasion to say:
<q>Let us beware, lest in giving our Spirits some Relaxation, we
lose the harmony of our Souls, where the Virtues form an
agreeable Consort.</q> And the third Condition required in our
Sports, as well as in all the other Actions of our Lives, is, that they
be sutable to the Person, Time and Place, and regulated by all the
other Circumstances which may render them inoffensive. It would
be easy for me to prove that none of these Qualifications are wanting
to the Plays, as they are in <hi>France;</hi> from whence you ought to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
that they are good and allowable.</p>
                  <p>After all I have said for Plays, you cannot question but they ought
to be such as are free from all immodest Speeches and Actions. You
have told me your self, that the Players are very careful of this
point, and that they would not so much as suffer, when they accept of
any piece, that it should have any thing in it indecent, licentious, equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocal,
or the least word under which any poison might be conceal'd.</p>
                  <p>We have very severe Laws in <hi>France</hi> against Blasphemers; they
are bor'd through the Tongue, they are condemn'd even to be
burn'd: and should we caress the Players, or give them any privilege
if they were Blasphemers, Libertines, or Profane?</p>
                  <p>We own, say our Reformers, that they dare not openly speak any
thing that is profane, nor act upon the Stage those Infamies which
were formerly acted there, but there is still something remaining of
its primitive Corruption disguis'd under gay Names. Is there any
Play acted now, where there is not some Love-intrigue or other?
where the Passions are not represented in all their light? and
where mention is not made of Ambition, Jealousy, Revenge and
Hatred? A dangerous School for Youth, where they are easily dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
to raise real Passions in their Hearts by seeing feign'd ones re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented!
The first Duty of a Christian is to suppress his Passions,
and not to expose himself to the growth of them; and by a necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Consequence, nothing is more pernicious than that which is capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of exciting them.</p>
                  <p>A fine Speech this for a rigid Declaimer, but not sound enough for
an equitable Divine! Is there no difference, think ye, between an
Action or a Word which may by accident raise the Passions, and those
which do it in reality?</p>
                  <p>The last are absolutely unlawful and sinful; and tho it might hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
that a Man might be unmov'd by them, yet we are oblig'd to
avoid them, because 'tis only by chance that they produce not their
<pb n="xxiv" facs="tcp:104583:13"/>
effect, whereas in their own nature they are always attended with
pernicious Consequences. But for those Actions and Words which
may by accident raise the Passions, we cannot justly condemn them;
and we must even fly to Desarts to avoid them; for we cannot
walk a Step, read a Book, enter a Church, or live in the World,
without meeting with a thousand things capable of exciting the Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions.
Must a Woman because she is handsom never go to Church,
for fear of exciting the Lust of a Debauchee? Must the Great in
Courts, and the Magistrates lay aside that Splendor which is becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and perhaps necessary to them, for fear of exciting Ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and a desire of Riches in others? Must a man never wear a Sword
for fear of being guilty of Murder? This would be ridiculous: and
tho by misfortune a Scandal happen, and an occasion of sinning be
taken, 'tis a <hi>Passive,</hi> not an <hi>Active</hi> Scandal, (pardon those School-terms)
'tis an Occasion <hi>taken,</hi> not <hi>given,</hi> which kind alone we are
order'd to avoid; for as to the first, 'tis impossible to avoid it,
and sometimes, to foresee it.</p>
                  <p>All Histories (not excepting the Bible) make use of such words
as express the Passions, and relate great Actions of which they have
been the Cause. And will it be a Crime to read History, because
we may there meet with something which may be an occasion of our
falling? By no means, unless it be a scandalous, profane and loose
History, such a one as does infallibly stir up dangerous Passions, and
then 'tis no longer an occasion <hi>taken,</hi> but <hi>given.</hi> But this is not the
Character of our Plays; for tho they speak of Love, Hatred, Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition,
Revenge, and the like, 'tis not done with an Intention of
exciting those kinds of Passions in the Audience; nor are there any
such scandalous Circumstances in them, as will infallibly produce
such mischievous Effects in their Minds. Besides, as the wise <hi>Lycurgus</hi>
said, Shall we destroy all the Vines, because some men get drunk
with the juice of the Grape? An ill use has and may be made of the
most Sacred things, such as are the Holy Scriptures, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of the most indifferent and least serious: yet neither the one nor
the other ought to be forbidden, unless we would forbid every thing
that may be put to an ill Use.</p>
                  <p>As to the second Qualification which our Casuists require in Sports,
which is to avoid breaking the Harmony of the Soul by the excess
and length of our Pleasures; it may be said, that neither those who
go to Plays, nor those who compose them, nor those who act them,
so far unbend their Minds, as to destroy that just disposition of Soul.
As for the first, they have their Liberty to go or stay away; and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
a days Labour, two Hours of Refreshment may be allow'd. As
for the Authors and Players, whose Profession seems to be one conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="xxv" facs="tcp:104583:13"/>
Diversion, they do not certainly look upon their Lives to be a Play,
since they have other serious Business in their Families, besides the
common Duties of Christians to perform.</p>
                  <p>As for the circumstance of Time, of which our Casuists would
have us take care, it is observed in <hi>France,</hi> where they never act but
at proper Hours. One of the things against which the Fathers de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim'd
the most was, the time of acting the Plays; they lasted the
whole day, and People had scarce any time to go to Church. Thus
St. <hi>Chrysostom</hi> complains; <q>That the Christians in his time, and
in his Diocess, did not only go to Plays, but were so intent up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them that they staid whole days at those infamous Sights,
without going one moment to Church.</q> St. <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Damascus</hi>
condemn'd the same Excess, in these words, <q>There are several
Towns where the Inhabitants are from morning to night Feast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their Eyes with all manner of Sights, and in hearing always
immodest Songs, which cannot chuse but raise in their Minds
wicked Desires.</q> Is there any thing to be found like this in our
Plays? They begin at five or six a Clock, when Divine Service is
over, the Prayers and Sermon ended; when the Church Doors are
shut, and People have had time enough to bestow on Business and
Devotion; and they end about eight or nine.</p>
                  <p>As for the Circumstance of Places, 'tis observ'd in <hi>France;</hi> for,
whereas formerly they acted in Churches, now they have publick
Theatres for the purpose.</p>
                  <p>The Circumstance of the Persons is also observ'd, for those who
Act are civil People, who have undertaken the Employ, and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
behave themselves in it with Decency; at least there are as
few ill Men among them, as in other Professions: their Vice arises
from their own corrupt Nature, and not from the State or Calling
they are in, since all are not like them. I have convers'd, and
am particularly acquainted with some of them, who out of the
Theatre, and in their own Families, live the most exemplary Life
in the World: and you have told me your self, that all of them
in general, out of their common Stock, contribute a considerable
Sum to pious and charitable Uses; of which the Magistrates and

You see he has brought the Schoolmen to speak in favour of the
<hi>Drama,</hi> and has explain'd the Invectives of the Fathers against it, so as
to make them on its side. He has answer'd the most material Objections
which can be brought against the Stage, and given very necessary Precau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
to such as go to the Play-houses: You perceive 'tis a French Divine,<note n="*" place="bottom">

who has given us his Thoughts in this Letter; and 'tis in behalf of the
Plays acted in <hi>France</hi> that he has here argu'd. But were he to see our

            <head>To my Friend, the AVTHOR.</head>
            <l>'TIS hard, my Friend, to write in such an Age,</l>
            <l>As damns not only Poets, but the Stage.</l>
            <l>That sacred Art, by Heav'n it self infus'd,</l>
            <l>Which <hi>Moses, David, Salomon</hi> have us'd,</l>
            <l>Is now to be no more: The Muses Foes</l>
            <l>Wou'd sink their Maker's Praises into Prose.</l>
            <l>Were they content to prune the lavish Vine</l>
            <l>Of straggling Branches, and improve the Wine,</l>
            <l>Who but a mad Man wou'd his Faults defend?</l>
            <l>All wou'd submit; for all but Fools will mend.</l>
            <l>But, when to common sense they give the Lie,</l>
            <l>And turn distorted Words to Blasphemy,</l>
            <l>
               <hi>They</hi> give the Scandal; and the Wise discern,</l>
            <l>Their Glosses teach an Age too apt to learn.</l>
            <l>What I have loosly, or profanely writ,</l>
            <l>Let them to Fires (their due desert) commit.</l>
            <l>Nor, when accus'd by me, let <hi>them</hi> complain:</l>
            <l>Their Faults and not their Function I arraign.</l>
            <l>Rebellion, worse than Witchcraft, they pursu'd:</l>
            <l>The Pulpit preach'd the Crime; the People ru'd.</l>
            <l>The Stage was silenc'd: for the Saints wou'd see</l>
            <l>In fields perform'd their plotted Tragedy.</l>
            <l>But let us first reform: and then so live,</l>
            <l>That we may teach our Teachers to forgive.</l>
            <l>Our Desk be plac'd below their lofty Chairs,</l>
            <l>Ours be the Practice, as the Precept theirs.</l>
            <l>The moral part at least we may divide,</l>
            <l>Humility reward, and punish Pride:</l>
            <l>Ambition, Int'rest, Avarice accuse:</l>
            <l>These are the Province of the Tragic Muse.</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="xxviii" facs="tcp:104583:15"/>
These hast thou chosen; and the public Voice</l>
            <l>Has equal'd thy performance, with thy choice.</l>
            <l>Time, Action, Place, are so preserv'd by thee</l>
            <l>That ev'n <hi>Corneille,</hi> might with envy see</l>
            <l>Th' Alliance of his tripled Unity.</l>
            <l>Thy Incidents, perhaps, too thick are sown;</l>
            <l>But too much Plenty is thy fault alone:</l>
            <l>At least but two, can that good Crime commit;</l>
            <l>Thou in Design, and <hi>Wycherley</hi> in Wit.</l>
            <l>Let thy own <hi>Gauls</hi> condemn thee if they dare;</l>
            <l>Contended to be thinly regular.</l>
            <l>Born there, but not for them, our fruitful Soil</l>
            <l>With more Increase rewards thy happy Toil.</l>
            <l>Their Tongue infeebled, is refin'd so much,</l>
            <l>That, like pure Gold, it bends at ev'ry touch:</l>
            <l>Our sturdy <hi>Teuton,</hi> yet will Art obey,</l>
            <l>More fit for manly thought, and strengthen'd with Allay.</l>
            <l>But whence art thou inspir'd, and Thou alone</l>
            <l>To flourish in an Idiom, not thine own?</l>
            <l>It moves our wonder, that a foreign Guest</l>
            <l>Shou'd over-match the most, and match the best.</l>
            <l>In underpraising, thy Deserts I wrong:</l>
            <l>Here, find the first deficience of our Tongue:</l>
            <l>Words, once my stock, are wanting to commend</l>

A
TRAGEDY.</head>
            <head>ACT I.</head>
            <stage>The Scene throughout the Play is an Anti Chamber.</stage>
            <stage>Enter <hi>Vincentio</hi> in a Moorish-Dress, his Skin black'd over,
assuming the Name of <hi>Morat. Zemet</hi> his Servant.</stage>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mor.</speaker>
               <l>AH! poor <hi>Vincentio,</hi> alter'd more by Passions</l>
               <l>Than by this new Disguise, who now cou'd know thee?</l>
               <l>Thou'rt grown a Stranger to thy very self.</l>
               <l>'Tis scarce a Year since I fled hence to <hi>Afric;</hi>
               </l>
               <l>But oh! how Sorrow, Sickness, and Fatigue,</l>
               <l>And most my anxious Love, since that, have chang'd me.</l>
               <l>I doubt I wear this borrow'd Black and Dress</l>
               <l>Rather to try <hi>Placentia,</hi> thus unknown,</l>
               <l>Than to reclaim and save my wicked Brother.</l>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Zemet.</speaker>
               <l>You're but too kind to him, my Lord. I hear,</l>
               <l>That when a fatal Duel forc'd you hence,</l>
               <l>He stab'd the Friend who strove to get your Pardon,</l>
               <l>To hinder your Return.</l>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mor.</speaker>
               <l>With what unnat'ral Joy, he, in the Morning,</l>
               <l>Heard us confirm the Tidings of my Death!</l>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Zem.</speaker>
               <l>My Lord, if he's as wicked as he's thought,</l>
               <l>'Twou'd have been ill in him to have done better.</l>

Bad Men still act themselves in ev'ry thing that's bad,</l>
               <l>And are not to be blam'd for barb'rous Actions,</l>
               <l>More than the Beasts of Prey for Cruelty:</l>
               <l>Nor is it for their Vices, but their Natures,</l>
               <l>We shou'd destroy 'em both.</l>

            <sp>

               <l>Yes, he's my Shame;</l>
               <l>But still my Brother; therefore yet a while</l>
               <l>Let <hi>Lisbon</hi> think me dead, as I'm reported.</l>
               <l>In this Disguise I thought fit to confirm it;</l>
               <l>For, shou'd they think I live, the King wou'd never</l>
               <l>Grant him his Pardon for <hi>Don Carlo</hi>'s Murther.</l>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Zem.</speaker>
               <l>It seems he's sure of it, for he has left</l>
               <l>The Sanctuary, and lords it in your House.</l>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mo.</speaker>
               <l>Upon the confirmation of my Death,</l>
               <l>The King has sign'd the Warrant for his Pardon;</l>
               <l>So to prevent th' Extinction of our Name,</l>
               <l>Which Royal Gratitude still makes him value.</l>
               <l>Then let him revel, till the Seals are past,</l>
               <l>As a sole Brother in my large Estate;</l>
               <l>That done, I will revive, a severe check</l>
               <l>On all his future Life.</l>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Zem.</speaker>
               <l>I wish yours be secure, my Lord!</l>
               <l>Tools of Destruction still stand ready prest</l>
               <l>To a bad hand, and Murther watches sure.</l>
               <l>Then, give me leave to fear.</l>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mo.</speaker>
               <l>I'll keep Prevention's Eye upon the Watch;</l>
               <l>But I disdain to fear. For Death must come,</l>
               <l>And 'tis no matter when: Once in the Grave,</l>
               <l>Long Life and short are both become the same.</l>
               <l>Death levels all: Age, Beauty, Wealth, and Titles,</l>
               <l>Lye undistinguish'd, huddled up together,</l>
               <l>And none complain of what, or when, or how.</l>
               <l>Oh! I cou'd wish my Dust with thy dead Parents</l>
               <l>Lay blended in one Urn on <hi>Africk</hi>'s Shore,</l>
               <l>Rather than languish thus in hopeless Love,</l>
