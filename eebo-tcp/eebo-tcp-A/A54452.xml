            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>Whom I declare, that him who is the light of the world, all Nations may come to know, that all Nations may worſhip but one God, and have but one King and chief authority to rule and reign over them, and that by him who is the light of the world, you may be taught all things, as from the mouth of the Lord dayly, that no ſtrength may exceed your power, as ye ſhall know the hand of the Lord to be with you, and no wiſdom like unto your underſtanding as you take counſel of the Lord, and not of man, by which you ſhall ſee the utter overthrow and confuſion, yea the everlaſting deſolation of all that ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire againſt you, and the whole ſtrength and wiſdom of man to be but as duſt, and as a thing lighter then vanity in the air, that ſhal imbody themſelves as Hoſts, ſtriving to work your over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw.</p>

Thou oughteſt to know this one thing chiefly, that the dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Almighty God is King of the whole earth, and Lord of the Heavens alſo, with whom all nations are but as the duſt of the ballance, and drop of a bucket, who meaſureth the Heavens as with a ſpan, and holdeth the earth and the ſeas in the hollow of his hand, he is infinite in his Decrees, and his wayes paſt finding out; he hath overturned many Princes by his power, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown Kings by his might, and made many nations heaps of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation, and laid the pleaſant places waſte; foraſmuch as the Lord of Hoſts is jealous of his glory, which many have turned into contempt, even as the proud and lofty in heart have ſaid, Is there a God over us, that we ſhould fear to execute our wills upon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny? And ſo have turned equity backward, and have not had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard unto the Commandements of God, and have fruſtrated his Law, and caſt his holy Precepts behind their backs; and have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured the man of low degree, and oppreſſed the fatherleſſe and the widow, and have not had regard to the ſtranger which hath viſited them in loving kindneſs, but rather, have ſought to ſwallow up the innocent in his ſimplicity, with their horrid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bominable cruelty.</p>
                  <p>And in this the glory of the Lord hath been defaced, and is defaced by all that walk in the crookedneſs of the imaginations of their own hearts, ſtrengthning themſelves in their own wayes, making Fences for their ſafegard in iniquity, and Bulwarks for their ſtrength in unrighteouſneſs, and yet calls upon the name of the Lord, as if God had regard unto the cryes of the wicked, who will puniſh the ſinner in Zion, and reward the evil-worker in Jeruſalem.</p>
                  <p>And therfore all nations ought to be awakened leſt the ſons of men are cut off in the corruption of their wayes. And thou above all Princes and Kings, as the greateſt in all parts of the earth, oughteſt to ſhine forth as the brightneſs of the Sun at noon day, and as the chiefeſt of all nations in example of righteouſneſs, and purity of heart, which will crown thee with everlaſting honour, far exceeding the honours of the Kingdoms of men, and cauſe thy name never to be forgotten from gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration to generation, for ever, to be remembred after thee by all the Lords people, and ſervants of the living God; that thy
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:108889:4"/>
ſound alſo may ſtrike a dread through all the dead Worſhippers of Images in al lquarters of the whole world; and then it will come to paſs, that many will ſtand amazed at the excellency of thybeauty and renown, and thoſe that hate thee ſhall be tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedbecauſe of thee, and gnaſh their teeth at thy proſperity, and lie down in reſtleſſe pangs of perplexity.</p>
                  <p>And therefore for the glory of the Almighty Gods ſake, and that with it thou mayeſt be eſtabliſhed, and a holy ſeed after thee in perpetuall praiſe.</p>
                  <p>Ariſe and ſtand up, and ſhine forth in the excellency of meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and in the humbleneſſe, &amp; patience, and forbearance of thy heart, and in this moſt noble and excellent underſtanding, and choiceſt wiſdome, liſſen for a ſeaſon, and incline thine ear in due time to that in thee which is not of the Kingdomes of men; and behold from the Lord God, I ſhew thee the coming of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet in a Parable.</p>
                  <p>Like as the glory of the Sun ariſing in the Eaſt in mighty ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſiſtable power, diſperſing and ſending all the black clouds be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the appearance of the Weſt, where place cannot hide their blackneſs, as the Sun follows in his glorious flaming courſe, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king all to paſs a way as in ſhame and great fear.</p>
                  <p>Oh what can ſtand before the brightneſſe of the DAY? is not all the firſt in a tottering frame when the glory of the moſt high breaks forth? Men of ſtrength may wonderfully ſtrive, and men of prudence dive deeply, but no man is hid from the day.</p>
                  <p>Neither knoweth he the wiſdome of the whole World from whence the breath of the wind cometh, and out of what it breaketh.</p>
                  <p>No man hath deſcended into the deep to count the ſands hid with the waters of the Ocean. Who then can fathome wiſdom to underſtand that which the natural never ſaw nor thought of?</p>
                  <p>Under this I conclude the whole world; All fleſh hath corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it's way before the Lord, and the wiſdome of the firſt man <hi>Adam</hi> is not regained; foraſmuch as the reſtauration hath been hid from ages, which unto the deſolate is tendered, that a broken wall may not remain without repair in a whole Nation.</p>

And behold it is coming, it is coming, and with bleſſing thou wilt be bleſſed, and the ſeed of the whole Dominion, if thou ſtop not the courſe of bleſſing from thine own head.</p>
                  <p>Many generations before thee would have rejoiced to have ſeen this day which is coming towards thee of good things; if thou hearken to God, and deſpiteſt not the Meſsengers and Miniſters of his word, but liſteneſt with open ear to inſtruction, that thou mayeſt be eſtabliſhed for ever, the Throne of righteouſneſs to be the Lords, and thou the inſtrument in the Lords hand, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by Iuſtice, Mercy and Peace may be eſtabliſhed, and this know thee, That the Lord God of Heaven aad Earth, whoſe dread rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth unto the ends of all Dominions of the earth, <hi>Jehovah</hi> the Lord of Hoſts is his Name, can work without thee and beyond thee, and over the heads of all powers, who can change all hearts and affections in a moment, and in the twinckling of an eye; and make all affected onely with his own glory; but my God is the unſpeakable Fountain of mercy, and long ſuffering, who is riſen to prove and try many people, and behold he layes this work, and is laying it now at thy gates, &amp; one that loves thy ſoul is ſent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee, that canot flatter thee, but ſpeaks the ſimplicity of truth unto thee, and not his own words, as a lying divination.</p>
                  <p>But this is truth from him that dwelleth with the truth, God is light, and in him is no darkneſs at all, who is ariſen to try thee that thou mayſt be proved, whether in the pure tender love thou fingly ſtandeſt, or in the obſtinacy reſteſt, as one ſate down in a Chair of carved ſtone.</p>
                  <p>I ſay, Thus is the Lord God ariſen to try thee, even as he is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to make true proof of thy wayes, and to know therein whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thou art able to bear and endure, and paſs a tryall of thy wayes, in which the Lord who regardeth onely an humble heart will altogether ſift thee as unto the bottome, and prove thee, whether thou ſtandeſt as the holy Fathers and Kings did in the dayes of old, as <hi>David,</hi> who with an humble heart received the reproof and judgement of <hi>Nathan,</hi> and many more, who were precious patterns unto thee, and Examples before thee.</p>

May I be blamed in all this? doth not Wiſdome belong to the mighty, and doth not counſel become the Kings Court, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding the chiefeſt pallaces? and hath God bleſsed me with his word, and ſhewed me his wonders which are coming to paſs, and can I hide them from the King? Hath God put underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in my heart, to underſtand the deep things which have been hid from ages, and ſhall I darken and make void the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing with ſilence? Hath God ſhewed me the bleſſings of a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and the curſe of a Nation, and ſhall I bury this in the womb of obſcurity, and not publiſh the revelation of God, &amp; ſo through a careleſs heart come to be numbred among the curſed for ever?</p>

                  <p>And lo I ſhew this unto the JEWS of all ſorts, that the Jews alſo may come to be converted, and come to know the healing; They muſt all come to the cleanſiug of the heart by blood, and the purifying of their conſciences by the blood of ſprinkling; which is not uſed (in this the mighty day of God, which is dawn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) <hi>as an Ordinance of a carnal Commandment,</hi> but is come, and coming, as the ſubſtance of the eternal Decree of God concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the redemption from all the former, and reſtauration unto the firſt, and as the fulfilling of the promiſe of an endleſs life.</p>
                  <p>And therefore be awakened all ye that have ſlumbered, and are ſlumbering in the night of your Fathers, who were in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion againſt God, notwithſtanding they had the Law and the Precepts of God, even as from the mouth of God: Oh how did your Fathers the Jewes rebel and tempt the Lord God, although his mercies unto them were the greateſt!

                  <p>And therefore I ſay, Not as you will have times and ſeaſons, and Dayes and Worſhips, and Deliverances come to paſs, ſhall it come to paſs unto you, or be brought to paſs concerning you; but as the Word of the Lord God is and hath been the ſame from Ages which reacheth alſo unto this Age, from the Dread of which the ſons of men ſhall not eſcape, nor find a hiding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>place to reſt themſelves, who walks in the wayes of uncleanneſs and doth traverſe the paths of iniquity and unrighteouſneſs.</p>
                  <p>And therefore wait for the word of the Lord God unto you, that you may come to know your motion in righteouſneſs, that you may feel the vengeance removed which hath been long over your heads, that thereby you may come toknow the redemption in your dayes, and the reſtauration of God in the ſeaſon of his appointed time; until which, in vain is all your Synagogue and Temple-worſhips, and Altar-Offerings.

                  <p>And foraſmuch as wiſdom removeth the vails of darkneſſe, and openeth the path of iniquity, and leadeth to the Fountain of righteouſneſſe, and bringeth to the Well-ſpring of truth, I here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by hold forth the ground thereof, and from whence it ſprings, and how it comes to be received and ſtood in, to the honour of the living God, and beautifying the Face of the juſt, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nown of the upright.</p>

                  <p>This light is pure, which ſheweth a man every unclean ſpot of his life; and unto this light in a mans conſcience muſt a man turn in his mind, to be guided by it in his heart, which cometh from God who is light; and by it which cometh from God, who is the Fountain, a man will be led to the firſt principle of the good underſtanding, that is to ſay, unto the fear of the Lord, which is the beginning of wiſdome, which <hi>Solomon</hi> the wiſe King ſpoke, which was not only his words but alſo it was his life, whereby he came to grow in the wonderfull Underſtanding and admired wiſdome, which Regions round about were amazed at.</p>
                  <p>And unto this day the Lord God is the ſame to all that fear his Name in truth, and his loving kindneſſe is not ſhortned, not his mercy and favour ſlackned, but as man hath ſlackned his ſteps in diligence, waiting upon the Lord in the fear and dread, and awe of his Name.</p>

                  <p>And therefore a warning to the whole Earth is ſounded forth; Repent, repent, repent, the mighty day of the Lord God of Hoſts is at hand, a day of howling draweth nigh and the hour of bitter lamentation cometh to paſs, and thouſands, and ten thouſands ſhall roar and lament, and curſe the day that ever they were born, and yet not find eaſe of their miſery; behold, behold, Gods jealouſie even already burns like fire, and who can quench the flames?</p>
                  <p>Come forth, come forth, oh ye ſons of men, who have had eaſe in the fleſh for many years, &amp; have ſported your ſelves in the pleaſure thereof, and made your hearts groſs in uncleanneſs, and fatted your ſelves with fraud and with the ſlaughter of your innocent Neighbor; repent, and turn from your ſins, let the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the Nations lament themſelves, and the inhabitants of the earth rent their hearts, whileſt the Lord God is warning and viſiting you, before his judgements in ſore diſpleaſure as an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verflowing irreſiſtable flood overtakes the people, and ſweeps the Nations as with a beaſom of utter deſtruction, and ſcatters the wicked as the duſt and chaff of the high-wayes, as in a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt of a mighty Wind, with the breath of his mouth, and there be not a reſting place upon the face of the earth left for the
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:108889:10"/>
ſons of men to inhabit, becauſe of their abominations and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions, which God will repay with vengeance.</p>
                  <p>Remember <hi>Sodom,</hi> and call to minde the deſtruction of <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morah,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Nineveh</hi> alſo was warned, and <hi>Nineveh</hi> repented, and was ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the dayes of <hi>Ionah,</hi> and be it known unto you, this alſo is the day of your viſitation, written forth according to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment of God, and the motion of his word from on high.</p>
                  <p>And therefore whileſt ye have time, prize it, that as wiſe, ye may learn wiſdome, and live, and not as fools, hate inſtruction, and perſh.</p>
                  <p>I ſay unto thee O Turk, the Great One, I am not come into thy Coaſts to hide knowledge from thine eyes, or underſtanding from thine heart, but in love to viſit thee with the Meſſage of a goodly Treaſure, which never failed to ſtrenghen my Fathers in a ſtrange Land, or to nouriſh their ſeed in a Wilderneſs, or to give courage to them in weakneſs to vanquiſh the mighty force of their Enemies, that thou mayeſt come to the ſame, to drink of the ſame, and eat of the ſame, to be nouriſhed with the ſame, unto the ſame life &amp; dignity which the Lord giveth, which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celleth the honour of all mortall fleſh, which the Lord God will ſtain, that his honor, and ſuch as he honors, may be onely hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable.</p>
                  <p>Lo, I declare the ſubſtance of all things, that thou mayeſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply thy heart in diligence to the fear of the Lord, that thereby thou mayeſt know the operation of the ſubſtance in thee, that with the vertue, power and life thereof, thou mayeſt come to propheſie upon thy Throne, as <hi>Dauid</hi> did upon his Throne; and judge in Wiſdom in thy Pallace, as <hi>Solomon</hi> did in his Pallace and Court, unto whom a heart of underſtanding was given, that he judged the people aright, and ſought not for counſel, or inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, or advice from man, but had the word from the Lord, of Counſel, of Prudence, and of pure judgement; ſo that his Courts was bounded with Peace as with an Iron Band, and fen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced as with a Fort of Braſs, untill <hi>Solomon</hi> committed idolatry, and then was an adverſary ſtirred up againſt him. Behold the Lord God will work mighty wonders by thee, and thorow thee, if thou takes counſel of him with an upright ſober heart, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:108889:10"/>
thy bed; God is a Spirit and in ſpirit the Lord God will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich thee, if thou keepeſt thy minde to the Light in thy conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, to be ruled by it, that thou mayeſt rule and govern accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to it, all that are thy Subjects, the inhabitans and people that are within the compaſs of thy Dominion.</p>
                  <p>And herein thou ſhalt come to bear me teſtimony in the Spirit of Light (as thou turns thy mind to the Light which ſhews thee thy ſins) that will cleanſe thy heart, and purifie thy minde from the thoughts and motions of ſin and evill, and redeem thy ſoul and ſpirit from corruption, and reſtore thee as in the day of the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> in innocency, out of hurt and abuſe, unto that ſtate which God Almighty bleſſed, and all the creatures thou wilt come to have Dominion over, and the Earth ſubdue, and many will bleſs the day of thy birth, if Gods Seed in thee comes to live, that thy Seed may repleniſh every Iſland and Continent of the Earth; Thou knoweſt not Gods work what he is about to doe; if thou hearken, and obey, and with one heart, and with one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent thy Nobles and Nation ſayes <hi>Amen, Let the work of the Lord be done.</hi> I ſay then, If thy Ancients, and thy honourable men, and the Mothers of many children in thy Coaſts, with the man of low degree, turns from the evil of their walking, and corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their wayes, unto the Light in all their conſciences, to ſtand in righteouſneſs for the renown of the Lord, even the jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous God of his glory, as they come to honour and worſhip in ſpirit, them will he crown with dignity, and cauſe their fame to ſpread; and make the frame of thy Dominion to be the pattren of his mighty work, until the whole Earth be ſubject unto the ſame dreadful authority and power; and behold, this is the good which I ſhew thee, and the evil I have not hid from thy heart, that thou mayeſt not meditate it upon thy bed; but have opened both, and therefore chooſe thee whether; my conſcience to thee in the ſight of the Lord God I have cleared (touching this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter) in tender pure love to thy ſoul, and proſperity of thy Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in every quarter thereof.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Finally, Take this for thy ſtanding place, that thou mayeſt never be removed,</hi> Stand in the Light, as thy heart comes to be tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to it, and thou ſhalt know, that as thou ſtands in it, wiſdome will never depart thy habitation, and the deepeſt counſel, thy ſecret Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:108889:11"/>
which will eſtabliſh thee in thy Throne, as it did Solomon the wiſe King in his Throne.</p>
                  <p>But as thou haſt ſinned with thy lips, ſo thou muſt come to the mourning of a broken heart, that God may be honoured in the humility of thy ſoul and ſpirit, and thou thereby come in mercy to be exalted in his Kingdom of peace, plenty, and proſperity; Remember <hi>Nebucadnezzar</hi> the King, unto whom <hi>Daniel</hi> the Prophet propheſied, and ſhewed him the interpretation of hard things, chap 4.</p>
                  <p>Now I come to queſtion a few things, that the worth of Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome may be noted, which giveth alwaies the anſwer of true things, and ſuch as none other can ſtand againſt, to overturn, or gain-ſay.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Query</hi> 1. God looked upon the earth, and behold, all fleſh had corrupted his way before the Lord upon the earth. Now I do ask, In what can the truth and true worſhip of God be right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly holden? and who are the ſons of men that are not in the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted wayes? and what is that which they have attained unto, which will lead out of the corrupted wayes? and are not all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions living in lying, and ſwearing, and whoredome, and pride, and envy, and murder, and drunkenneſs, in the corrupted wayes?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Q.</hi> 2. By what is it that God tryeth the wayes of men? and what makes the truth and error, the corruption and incorrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all wayes manifeſt to man, whereby man comes to have aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance beyond all the traditions of his forefathers, that he is in the true way, a faithfull ſervant of the Lord, or that he is out of the true way of God, a ſervaut of Satan, through the luſt of corruption in ſin and tranſgreſſion?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Q.</hi> 3. What is the equal meaſure in man, which when the hand of the juſt meaſureth, giveth unto every man full due, and kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth not back the due from his Neighbor, neither can oppreſs any, but giveth unto his Enemies juſt weight and full meaſure alſo, and loveth his enemies, and rewardeth his enemies good for evill, ſhewing by his good, that his converſation is juſt, and his Religion not in vain?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="21" facs="tcp:108889:11"/>
Q. 4. Whether is it love or wrath, patience or raſhneſs, hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs or pride, temperence or immoderacy in life and gefture towards acquaintance or ſtranger, the good or the evil, that eſtabliſheth the Prince or the King upon the Throne? and what is the good that leads unto the good order of the beſt part? and how ought a man to follow it to be eſtabliſhed in righteouſneſs and in peace to the end? And whether if a man knows not the good in him to guide him, is not his foot ſubject to ſlip, and he to fall?</p>
                  <p>Q. 5. Whether would my owning of one Prophet in vertue, before another Prophets life, avail me any thing if I had not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the ſpirit of the Prophets? And how can the confeſſion of any Prophets Name, ſhew thereby that a people is of the Truth? And what if any man ſhould own God in words, and all the Prophets in words, and the Meſſiah in words what would that avail any man if he were not in the ſame pure way which the Prophets ſtood in, and knew ſomething in him which is of the nature of God?</p>
                  <p>Q 6. Will not that which trieth all people and Nations, try all Elders and Prophets alſo in all nations, and give teſtimony unto all people fearing God, whether they are of God, yea or nay? And is not this alſo the teſtimony of falſe Prophets, to ſay it ſhall come to paſs according to the words of their Propheſie, and it comes not at all to paſs, but they ſpeak preſumptuouſly, as ſaith the Lord unto <hi>Moſes</hi> concerning the falſe Prophets? And doth not this give teſtimony of a true Prophet, when the word of the Prophet cometh to paſs according to his Propheſie, that the Prophet ſhal be known to the people that the Lord hath tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſent him?</p>
                  <p>Q. 7. The Meſſiah was the promiſe of God from the beginning, and he was manifeſt in the fleſh in ſpirit; but how doth he now bruiſe the Serpents head? and what part in man is that which is the Serpent? and who hath felt the power and operation of the other Seed in his heart to bruiſe the Serpents Head without which there is no Salvation?</p>
                  <p>Q. 8. What and how is the world ſet in mans heart (as ſaith <hi>Solomon)</hi> whereby a man cannot find out the beginning or the end of the work of God? And how comes the myſtery of the
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:108889:12"/>
writings of the Prophets, which ſpeaks of the Kingdome and glory of the living God tobe known &amp; underſtood in ſpirit and life, as they were given forth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Q</hi> 9. Let me ask of the Prophets in <hi>Aſia,</hi> and enquire of thoſe that propheſie in <hi>Africa,</hi> what is the interpretation of my viſion; &amp; let the Emperour enquire of them one by one, leſt they dream a Divination of their own heart, and conſent together in falſhood, and ſo deceive thee, and but mock him that uprightly enquireth, that the Emperor may have the underſtanding of the Times.</p>
                  <p>In my Viſion I ſaw ſeven Trees planted in ſeven places, and the ground of ſix of them (where they grew) was of one nature, and each Tree had his Fence about him; and I ſaw many Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men labouring to raiſe the defence higher; they began to labour when it was a little light, &amp; the night ſhortly overtook them all that they could not work any longer; ſo that they ſaw not good of the works of their hands, and therefore they ſate down and ſlept in ſorrow.</p>
                  <p>And it came to paſs that there aroſe a Star, which while the Workmen ſlumbered, it ſhewed me, that the firſt Tree was full of Moſs, and withered without ſhooting a leaf, &amp; ſo waxed rotten; and I heard one ſay, that notwithſtanding it ſhould remain for a ſeaſon, untill a fire be kindled.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond ſprouted out ſome certain leaves, and it grew into two bodies from one root, the one was more green &amp; freſh in co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour then the other; and it came to paſs that a wind blew, and they daſhed each other, but the green part ſtood longeſt, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though her leaves falled therewith, and the body waxed dry at the Root.</p>
                  <p>The third proſpered for a little ſeaſon, but much heat parched the branches thereof, and that alſo decayed.</p>
                  <p>The fourth had a time of proſperity, but the Winter-ſeaſon blowed cold winds over her boughs, inſomuch that the rind ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of peeled away, ſo that the body was left naked, and it with<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> red ſtanding.</p>
                  <p>The fifth grew by a pleaſant Brook, &amp; the Waters thereof refre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed her Root, but the ground being not good to retain the moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture although that ſhe buded and bloſſomed, yet it came to paſs
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:108889:12"/>
that a wind from the north, gently blew over it, and many of the bloſſoms were blaſted, and the reſt that remained, although they came to grow towards the goodneſs of Fruits, yet after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards there came a ruſhing wind from the riſing of the Sun, and they all fell in an untimely ſeaſon.</p>
                  <p>The ſixth grew mightily, more tall and lofty then all the other five, and was the moſt of all beautified with the largeſt leaves, and delightful coloured bloſsomes, which covered her large quick ſpouting boughs, but imediately her root became a nurſe of rottenneſs.</p>
                  <p>And I ſaw an Ax<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>blade in the hand of a certain Shepherd, and Io he looked over all the ſix, and ſaid, <hi>This is becauſe of their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fruitfulneſs, and yet a ſorer thing muſt come to paſs;</hi> and he turned unto the ſeventh Tree, which was planted in a low valley, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploughed, and behold her body bowed, and ſhe ſtooped unto him that had the Ax blade in his right hand, &amp; he took a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of that Tree, without hurt to the body, and he made there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with a Helve for the Ax, and faſtened it thereunto. And he tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned again towards the ſixth Tree, and ſmote it that it fell to the ground, and ſo he paſſed to the Fences of all the other five firſt, and made breaches upon them, that they may all utterly become a deſolation for ever.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And he again ſaid,</hi> Even ſo muſt it be unto many Oaks and Cedars, and wild Apple Trees, in the Woods, and Wilderneſſe of the Forreſt of the Regions of the Earth.<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>And.<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                           <desc>•…</desc>
                        </gap> he returned to the ſeventh Tree, and digged about it, and pruned it, and it bare Fruit to his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. And he again uttered his word, and ſaid,</hi> This is to ſpread, and I will dig a well by her, and make her field pleaſant, and a refreſhing River ſhall compaſs her banks, that my flocks which I have in ſecret places may openly feed as one Herd within the compaſſe of this Fence which I have framed, and will build it round about, that no Thief may reach to taſt of her fruit.</p>
                  <p>And I ſaw it, and bleſſed the Lord, and magnified the Name of the Moſt high God.</p>
                  <p>Q. 10. Is there any pure Religion upon the Face of the Earth, but where the people doth do unto all men as they would men ſhould do unto them, which the light in a mans conſcience teacheth to do? And is not all profeſſion of pure Religion and
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:108889:13"/>
holineſs without that pure peaceable practiſe, any other than abomination and rottenneſſe in the account of the holy, juſt God?</p>
                  <p>Q. 11<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> God bleſſed me in the womb, and ſanctified me in the day of my birth, who hath ſeparated me from the land of my na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural nativity; and now how if my love is conſtrained to be more towards the Seed in the <hi>Turk</hi> then unto the fleſh of <hi>Englands</hi> Inhabitants? ought I therefore the more to be curſed by my own Nation, or leſſe bleſſed by thy Nation? Or am I faulty to ſtand againſt iniquity in the gate, to ſtop the flood of wrath which is ready to enter in as through a gap? or may I be blamed in wreſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, that bleſſing may over-ſpread the length and breadth of thy Dominion?</p>
                  <p>Q. 12. I would not offend the juſt, or trouble the righteous, yet I enquire of the wiſe men of thy Court, whether is it againſt the Law of God, and life of the holy men, to try all things, and hold faſt that which is good? and how ſhall any know the good ſimply as it comes from the Fountain, ſo as to be plainly diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhable from that which is but a ſhew in hypocriſie? is there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing that makes manifeſt, or that can make manifeſt truth in a mans ſpirit, and ſeal it to his heart, beyond the traditions of men or the perſwaſions of women, beſides the light in a mans conſcience, which convinceth him of his ſins?</p>
                  <p>Now I querie concerning that which will diſcover ſuch in the Cloſet of a mans heart, who are in other Nations, to be a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple walking in the pure Religion: there is a ſtone to try all met<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals by.</p>
                  <p>Q. 13 And what is the Touchſtone of tryal of all Nations? What is that by which <hi>Abel,</hi> and <hi>Enoch,</hi> and <hi>Noah,</hi> and <hi>Abraham,</hi> and <hi>Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Iacob</hi> walked, who walked by a Rule before <hi>Moſes</hi> was, to whom firſt the Law in Tables of ſtone was given? what was the Rule before the Prophets or the Scriptures, and the Law in Tables, by which the Holy men of God had the witnes &amp; teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the truth and Kingdom of God, which if the Scriptures and the writings of the Law given in tables of ſtone, had been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways hid from this generation, &amp; the prophets writings from the people of this age, yet might the ſeed have the ſame teſtimony by
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:108889:13"/>
the ſame thing which <hi>Abel</hi> and <hi>Enoch</hi> had of God, and which Gods ſervants now have.</p>
                  <p>Q. 14. Hath thy Nation the Faith of living after death? if they have not, I am then anſwered before I aske; but if they have that Faith, I then enquire, whether is it better to die as a ſtranger among men for conſcience ſake, and be received as an everlaſting ſojourner with the Lord in the endleſſe day of bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, then to be the moſt acquainted and beloved amongſt men, and after the time of man to periſh worſe then the beaſts of the field? And what is honour or profit of riches in this life, to be for ever miſerable in the life to come?</p>
                  <p>Q. 15 It was the great ſin of the <hi>Jews</hi> in the dayes of old, in making Idols of Gold, and Silver, and Stone, and Wood, and Men, and Prophets, and of their own ſtrength; it was alſo their ſin in having the Law and the Commandments, and yet walked with looſe hearts, worſhipping only with their lips and mouth, and in ſpirit and minde, were ſtrangers to God, the eternal ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit: And is it an evil for me to ſay, Enquire and ſee, and ſearch in thy own borders to find out if ſuch a thing, or the reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance of this thing be not within the compaſſe of thy Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion.</p>
