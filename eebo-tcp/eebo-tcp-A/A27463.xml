         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>MEMOIRS
OF
Sir JOHN BERKLEY.</head>
            <p>IN the Year 1647 her Majesty and
his Highness the Prince of <hi>Wales</hi>
were pleased to send me into <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
to condole the Death of the Prince
of <hi>Orange;</hi> and having performed that
Office, I returned with Mr. <hi>John</hi> and
Mr. <hi>William Ashburnham</hi> to <hi>France,</hi> by the
way of <hi>Calais;</hi> where we met with the
News of his Majesty's being seized by
one Cornet <hi>Joyce</hi> in <hi>Holmby</hi> House, from
whence he was carried with a Guard of
400 Horse towards the Army, the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net
producing no Authority whereby to
warrant this proceeding. The next
Post brought us Advertisement to <hi>Calais,</hi>
that his Majesty was well received by
the Officers and Soldiers of the Army,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:51505:3"/>
and that there were great hopes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
that they would both concur to
establish his Majesty in his just Rights.
From <hi>Calais</hi> we went to <hi>Rouen,</hi> where
we met a Confirmation of this Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence,
and heard withal, that one Sir
<hi>Edward Ford</hi> (who was Brother-in-law
to Commissary General <hi>Ireton</hi>) was sent
by her Majesty and his Highness the
Prince of <hi>Wales</hi> into <hi>England,</hi> to discover
the Intentions of the Army, and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
an Agreement between his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
and them. From <hi>Rouen</hi> we went
to <hi>St. Germains;</hi> where we were no soon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
arrived, but we heard that Mr. <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>
(who during his Imprisonment had
contracted a great Familiarity with Mr.
<hi>Peters,</hi> a Preacher, and a powerful per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
in the Army) was dispatch'd with
a Commission to the like effect with that
of Sir <hi>Edward Ford.</hi> As I was going up
to her Majesty, I met accidentally with
my Lord <hi>Culpepper,</hi> who scarce had sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted
me, before he told me, that I must
prepare my self immediately for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:51505:3"/>
Journey, her Majesty being resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to send me into <hi>England</hi> after Sir <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Ford</hi> and Mr. <hi>Denham.</hi> I answer'd,
that I had no Pass, nor any Acquaintance
with any one of the Army; and that I
doubted, if the King's Party should come
too thick upon them at first, those of
the Army would be jealous they should
have too many Sharers in the Places
and Preferments they might perhaps me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate
to procure and preserve to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.
His Lordship replied, That if
I were afraid to go into <hi>England,</hi> her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
and his Highness would serve them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
of some other person, because
they conceived it necessary to employ
some to the Army, that might be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
to have greater Trust both with
the Queen in <hi>France,</hi> and with the King
in <hi>England,</hi> than either Sir <hi>Edward Ford</hi>
or Mr. <hi>Denham</hi> had. I return'd, That
if after a serious consideration it should
be judged of use to dispatch me into
<hi>England,</hi> I would adventure, tho I had
not the honour to be very well known
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:51505:4"/>
to his Majesty, and therefore could not
expect any great Trust from him. To
that part his Lordship replied, That
there was an Intention to send Mr. <hi>John
Ashburnham</hi> after me; but that he would
not go without a Pass, and therefore
that I should have it added to my In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions
to procure him one. With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
few days after, I had my Dispatch,
and went by the way of <hi>Dieppe,</hi> where
I met with Mr. <hi>William Leg</hi> of the Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chamber
to his Majesty. He embarked
with me for <hi>England;</hi> we arriv'd at
<hi>Hastings,</hi> and from thence went the next
day towards <hi>London.</hi> Two miles on this
side <hi>Tunbridg</hi> I met with Sir <hi>Allen Apsley,</hi>
who had been my Lieutenant-Governor
of <hi>Exeter,</hi> and afterwards Governor of
<hi>Barnstaple</hi> in the County of <hi>Devon.</hi> He
told me that he was going to me from
<hi>Cromwel</hi> and some other Officers of the
Army, with Letters, and a Cypher and
Instructions, which were to this effect:
<q>That he should desire me to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
that in some Conferences with
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:51505:4"/>
Colonel <hi>Lambert</hi> and other Officers of
the Army upon the rendring of <hi>Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi>
I had taken notice of the Army's
bitter inveighing against the King's
person, as if he had been the worst
of men, and their excessive extolling
the Parliament; both which being
without any colour of ground, I had
concluded that those Discourses were
not out of any perswasion of mind,
but affected to prepare men to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the Alteration of Government
they intended the Parliament should
effect by the assistance of the Army;
which I had said was not only a most
wicked, but a very difficult if not an
impossible Design, for a few men not
of the greatest Quality to introduce a
Popular Government against the King
and his Party, against the Presbyteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
against the Nobility and Gentry,
against the Laws establish'd both
Ecclesiastical and Civil, and against
the whole Genius of the Nation, that
had been accustomed for so many
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:51505:5"/>
Ages to a Monarchical Government.
Whereas on the other side, if they
would but consider, that those of
their Party had no particular obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to the Crown, as many of the
Presbyterians had, and therefore ought
less to despair of his Majesty's Grace
and Favour; that the Presbyter began
this War upon specious pretences of
making the King a glorious King;
that under that pretext they had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
many well-meaning men, and
had brought great things to pass; but
that now the Mask was taken off,
and they discovered to have sought
their own Advantages, and at the same
time the Power almost wrested out of
their hands to do themselves much
good or others hurt, and that by the
Independent Party, who could esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish
themselves no way under Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
so justly and prudently, as by
making good what the Presbyterians
had only pretended, that is, restoring
King and People to their just and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:51505:5"/>
Rights; which would so ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiate
them with both, that they would
voluntarily invest them with as much
Trust and Power as Subjects are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of. Whereas if they grasped
more, it would be with the general ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred,
and their own destruction. To
this Discourse of mine they only gave
a Hearing, but no Consent, as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
from an Interest much divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
from theirs: but since they have
found by experience all or the most
part to be so reasonable that they were
resolved to put it in practice, as I
might perceive by what had already
pass'd; they desired for the present
nothing of me, but that I would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
them humbly to the Queen and
Prince, and be Suitor to them in their
Names, not to condemn them abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely,
but to suspend their Opinions
of them, and their Pretensions to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
his Majesty, and judg them ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by their future Behaviour, of the
innocence whereof they had already
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:51505:6"/>
given some Testimonies to the World,
and would do more and more daily.
When I should have done this Office,
they desired I would come over into
<hi>England,</hi> and become an Eye-witness
of their Proceedings. </q>I thought this
Rencounter no ill <hi>Omen</hi> to my future
Proceedings. Sir <hi>Allen Apsley</hi> told me
I should have to do with subtil men,
that govern'd themselves by other Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xims
than the rest of the World. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
I answer'd, that the Caution
was good, and that I would arm my
self the best I could; but that it was
hard to secure our selves from malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
men when we were absolutely in
their power. I took the best Informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
I could from Sir <hi>Allen Apsley,</hi> and
resolved with him to go into <hi>London</hi>
before I went to the King or the Army,
that I might be enlighten'd by the most
able men of our Party; which I did,
and collected this following Discourse
from them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:51505:6"/>
[During the time his Majesty was at
<hi>Newcastle,</hi> the Independent Party was
so prevalent in the House of Commons,
that the Presbyterians were forced to
consent to have the King render'd by
the <hi>Scots</hi> to the Parliament; and his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
was accordingly deliver'd by them
to the <hi>English</hi> Committee, and a Guard
of <hi>English</hi> set upon him of the Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian
party, and no passionate Enemies
of his Majesty. The Presbyterian par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
that was very numerous in the House
of Commons, and over-voted the other
in most Questions, had engaged them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
privately (by some of their Chiefs)
to the <hi>Scots</hi> in two points; first, that
the Army should be disbanded, and
then the King brought to his Parliament
with Honour and Safety. The disban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
was gone about very seriously by
the Parliament; and a Committee
(whereof the Earl of <hi>VVarwick</hi> was the
chief) chosen, and accordingly sent to
<hi>Newmarket</hi> or <hi>Saffron-walden,</hi> where the
Army then lay. Many of the Army
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:51505:7"/>
professed really their Obedience to the
Parliament as to the disbanding; but
none more solemnly than <hi>Cromwel,</hi> who
made great Execrations against himself
in the House, if he did not desire it cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dially.
He had always professed great
Submission to the Parliament, who had
very liberally rewarded him for his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
and was hopeful to have begotten
so great a confidence in them, that they
would have been contented to entertain
the Army as their Pretorian Band, and
therefore was very sorry to see the House
bent to license them, but durst not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
against it, because he had many
Ill-willers in the Army, and did believe
they durst not, or would not, unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mously
oppose the Parliament in that
particular, and therefore refused to go
to the Army, tho he was sent for often
by the mutinous Party, who upon that
score were not a little offended with
him; and at length, their Discontents
increasing, seeing themselves deserted by
their Superior Officers, thought of some
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:51505:7"/>
means to secure themselves from their
Ungrateful Parliament, which they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
now perfectly to hate, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
chose to themselves Adjutators in
every Regiment, and in every Troop
of Horse, by whom they engaged them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to be absolutely concluded. The
first Resolution these new-elected Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
took, was, not to disband, and the
next, to seize the King's Person. <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel</hi>
staid very long in <hi>London,</hi> for one
that had been the Author of that De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign:
however, he at last stole out of
Town, and joined with the Mutineers,
but did not so readily concur in the
seizing the King's Person, or at least
pretended not to do it: For he sent his
Kinsman <hi>VVhalley</hi> with Orders to use all
means but Force, to cause his Majesty
to return to <hi>Holmby;</hi> but his Majesty ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely
refusing, <hi>VVhalley</hi> marched with
his Majesty towards the Army.]</p>
            <p>This Account I had from the most
discerning of my Acquaintance in <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi>
from whence I went to the Head-Quarters
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:51505:8"/>
at <hi>Reading,</hi> with intention (af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
I had deliver'd my Message) to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
leave to wait on his Majesty at <hi>Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sum.</hi>
I was no sooner arriv'd at <hi>Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>
but I spoke with Sir <hi>Edward Ford</hi> and
Mr. <hi>John Denham.</hi> Both of them were
much of the same Advice with those I
had discoursed at <hi>London</hi> concerning the
present Power of the Adjutators, by
whom the most important Affairs of the
Kingdom and Army were transacted.
By them I learnt that His Majesty came
very unwillingly from <hi>Holmby;</hi> that his
Majesty would not go to the Army, tho
he were earnestly invited by the Officers;
that his Majesty, against the Consent of
the Army, concurr'd with the Vote of
the Parliament, to go to <hi>Richmond,</hi> where
he would have been out of the Army's
power, and would not be perswaded
out of his Resolution, till the Army for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
the Parliament to recal their Vote:
Then his Majesty would needs go to
<hi>Windsor,</hi> much against the sense of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my;
but because they could not perswade
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:51505:8"/>
his Majesty, they forced him from thence
by ill usage; and that the rather, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he would not be intreated to pass
by the Army in his way to <hi>VVindsor:</hi>
In sum, they doubted that his Majesty
hearkned to some secret Propositions of
the Presbyterians, and bent all his
thoughts to make an absolute Breach
between the Army and the Parliament,
which <hi>Ireton</hi> discerned, and told his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
plainly, <q>Sir, you have an intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to be the Arbitrator between the
Parliament and us, and we mean to
be it between your Majesty and the
Parliament.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Two or three hours after my arrival,
<hi>Cromwel</hi> sent an Officer to excuse him to
me, that he could not wait on me till ten
at night, by reason he was sitting with
the Committee of Parliament, and should
not rise till then. He came then accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied
with <hi>Rainsborough</hi> and Sir <hi>Hardress
VValler.</hi> After general discourse, I told
him the sum of my Instructions from the
Queen and Prince; which were to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:51505:9"/>
them, that her Majesty and his High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
were not partial to the Presbyteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
nor any way averse to them; that I
should endeavor to incline his Majesty to
comply with them as far as would stand
with his Honor and Conscience, and to
dispose them to press his Majesty no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
His answer was in these words:
<q>That whatever the World might judg
of them, they would be found no
seekers of themselves farther than to
have leave to live as Subjects ought to
do, and to preserve their Consciences;
that they thought no men could enjoy
their Lives and Estates quietly, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the King had his Rights, which
they had declared in general terms al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
to the World, and would more
particularly very speedily, wherein
they would comprise the several Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rests
of the Royal, Presbyterian, and
Independent Parties, as far as they were
consisting with each other;</q> which I
understood afterwards, to be meant of
the <hi>Proposals</hi> of the Army. I went the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:51505:9"/>
next day to the General, by <hi>Cromwel</hi>'s
direction, to ask his leave to see the
King; which he was pleased to grant.
I deliver'd my Letters and Instructions
to his Majesty. I found that his Majesty
discover'd not only to me, but to every
one he was pleased to converse with, a
total Diffidence of all the Army except
<hi>Huntington,</hi> and grounded it chiefly upon
the Officers backwardness to treat of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
any Favour or Advantage from
his Majesty. I was of his Majesty's sense,
that men whose hands were yet hot with
the blood of his most faithful Subjects,
ought not entirely to be trusted, but
thought they ought absolutely to be well
dissembled with whilst his Majesty was
in their hands, at least that he might the
better get out of them, and to this end
offered several Expedients; as, to suffer
<hi>Peters</hi> to preach before his Majesty, of
which he was very ambitious; and to
converse with him, and others of the
Army, with freedom; and by all means
to endeavour to gain the good Opinion
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:51505:10"/>
of the most active Adjutators, and the
like. But his Majesty concurred in none
of them; which made me doubt his
Majesty valued my Reasons something
the worse for the Author, and therefore
I meditated nothing so much as to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
a Pass for Mr. <hi>John Ashburnham,</hi>
with whom I hoped I might prevail, and
he with his Majesty; which within few
days after I did obtain, and caused it
to be deliver'd to his Servant.</p>
            <p>About four days after my coming to
the Army, there came two General Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers
from the Council of War to me,
to let me know, that they had been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
that I had some wrong done me
upon the Rendition of <hi>Exeter,</hi> to a
great value; and that if I would put the
Sum under my hand, they would see
that I should have satisfaction. I gave
them most hearty thanks; but withal
told them, that I came not to them up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
my own business, but that of his
Majesty; which as soon as they should
dispatch, no man living would be more
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:51505:10"/>
ready to receive and acknowledg this or
any other favour from them; till then,
it would no way become me to do it.
This was a Generosity which those Self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denyers
thought might do well in dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
and speculation: but could not
understand it when brought into prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice,
and therefore concluded that I was
so great a Presbyterian, that I would
chuse rather to lose twelve hundred
pounds (which was my pretension)
than to offend my Lord <hi>Roberts,</hi> a great
Presbyterian, who must have made me
Reparation; in which opinion they
were confirmed by two Letters they had
lately perused, the one from Sir <hi>Marma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duke
Langdale</hi> at <hi>Antwerp,</hi> and the other
from Sir <hi>William Fleetwood</hi> at <hi>London;</hi> both
affirming, that to their knowledg I was
an engaged Presbyterian. I was alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
a stranger to them both, and
therefore did attribute this either to their
Envy that I was admitted, or Grief that
they were excluded from the Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
between his Majesty and the Army.
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:51505:11"/>
However it was, upon those surmises
<hi>Cromwel</hi> came to expostulate the matter
plainly with me, and I replied to him
in these words, That I was as much Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian
as Independent; that I, as well
as others, was inclined to think the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of them, because they pretended to
mind the King's Restoration; but bid
them be assured, that as soon as I should
discover they were not real, I, and I
thought all the King's Party, would join
with any that would but dissemble bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
than they; and concluded, that I
thought nothing would separate the
Crown and the King's Party. <hi>Cromwel</hi>
seemed not unsatisfied with this plain
dealing, and so left me. The next day
<hi>Huntington,</hi> who was sent to me by the
King, made me acquainted with two
General Officers, whom I durst not name
because they are obnoxious to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
Power. With these I had often and
free Communication; and inquiring
what Opinion they had of the Army in
general, as to a conjunction with the
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:51505:11"/>
King, they replied, that they did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
it was universally desired both by
the Officers and Adjutators; that if <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel</hi>
was not real in it, he was a great Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembler,
and so was <hi>Ireton;</hi> that for the
present the whole Army was so bent up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it, that they durst not be otherwise;
that if they should ever happen to change,
they should easily discover it; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they had been in great part the
Cause that Sir <hi>Allen Apsley</hi> was sent to
me, they thought themselves obliged to
give me all the light they could of things
and persons; which to the last they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed,
in my opinion, most sincerely.
I let them know at our first meeting,
that I doubted there would be three great
Difficulties which would obstruct the
Agreement. First, they would expect
that the King should not only give them
Liberty of Conscience, but alter the Esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish'd
Ecclesiastical Government, which
his Majesty was perswaded he could not
in conscience do. The second, that
they would not be contented to separate
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:51505:12"/>
some few men from the Court, and from
bearing great Offices, unless they and
their Posterity were ruined, and that by
the King's Act, which his Majesty could
not in Honor permit. And thirdly, that
they would not be contented with a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity
of the Militia during his Majesties
life, and his Majesty could not grant it
farther, but infinitely to the prejudice of
his Posterity. They assured me that his
Majesty would be press'd in none of these
particulars, and that there was a draught
of Proposals which <hi>Ireton</hi> had drawn,
and which would certainly be voted by
the whole Army, wherein there was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
tending to any such purpose; and
if his Majesty would consent to them,
there would be an end of all difficulties;
and they thought the sooner his Majesty
did it, would be the better, because there
was no certainty in the temper of the
Army, which they had observed to have
alter'd more than once already. I ask'd
whether I might not have a sight of these
Proposals; they answer'd, when I plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed.
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:51505:12"/>
I went with them to <hi>Ireton</hi> for that
purpose, and remained with him almost
till morning. He permitted me to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
two of the Articles, and that in most
material points; and I would have done
a third, which was, the excluding seven
persons (that were not named) from
Pardon, and the admitting of our Party
to sit in the next Parliament. To the
first he answer'd, That being they had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed
in the War, if they should not in
the sight of the World make some distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
between themselves and those that
were worsted (who always bear the
blame of publick Quarrels) they had
so many malicious Enemies both in the
Parliament and Army, that they should
be censured of betraying their Party, and
to have sought their own ends by private
and indirect means. To the second,
He confess'd that he should himself be
afraid of a Parliament, wherein the
King's Party should have the major
Vote: but after the Agreement, if the
King's party and they could piece kindly
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:51505:13"/>
and cordially together, there would be
nothing easier than to procure his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
satisfaction in those two particulars.
He concluded, by conjuring me as I ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
his Majesties good and welfare,
that I would endeavour to prevail with
him to grant the Proposals, that they
might with the more confidence pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound
them to the Parliament, and
make an end of all differences. Out of
my Discourses and Inquiries I collected
these Observations: First, that the Army
was governed partly by a Council of
War, and partly by a Council of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
or Adjutators, wherein the General
had but a single voice; that <hi>Fairfax</hi> the
General had little power in either; that
<hi>Cromwel</hi> and his Son <hi>Ireton</hi> with their
Friends and Partisans, governed the
Council of War absolutely, but not that
of the Army, which was the most pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful,
tho they had a strong party there
also; but the major part of the Adju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tators
carried it. Amongst these Adjuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
there were many ill-wishers of <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel,</hi>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:51505:13"/>
looking on him as one who would
always make his advantages out of the
Army. These observed that <hi>Cromwel</hi>
resolved to prosecute his ambitious Ends
through all means whatsoever, and did
not only dissemble, but really change
his way to those Ends; and when he
thought the Parliament would make his
Fortune, resign'd himself totally to
them, even to the disbanding of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
before it was paid: When the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians
prevailed, he took the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant:
When he quitted the Parliament,
his chief dependence was on the Army,
which he endeavour'd by all means to
keep in Unity, and if he could not bring
it to his sense, rather than suffer any di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision,
went over himself, and carried
his Friends with him into that way the
Army did chuse, and that faster than
any in it. Upon this ground, when the
Army was for the Parliament, no man
so violent as he in both: When the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
became for the King against the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
no man drove so furiously as
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:51505:14"/>
he; and when the Army changed a third
time for the Parliament and against the
King, he was still the Leader: and if
the Army shall change a fourth time to
become Levellers (tho he will oppose
this at first, as he did all other Changes)
no man shall out-go him in Level<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.
All that he seems to desire is, that
the Army would be constant in any way,
that he might not be necessitated to the
playing of so many different parts, he
being equally indifferent to all that will
afford him equal Advantages.</p>
            <p>When I came to <hi>Reading,</hi> I found
many of the Adjutators jealous that
<hi>Cromwel</hi> was not sincere for the King,
and desired me, if I found him false
to their Engagement, that I would let
them know it, and they did not doubt
to set him right either with or against
his will. But in all my Conferences
with him, I found no man in appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
so zealous for a speedy Blow as he;
sometimes wishing that the King was
more frank, and would not tie himself
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:51505:14"/>
so strictly to narrow Maxims; some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
complaining of his Son <hi>Ireton</hi>'s
slowness in perfecting the Proposals, and
his not accommodating more to his
Majesty's sense, always doubting that
the Army would not preserve their good
inclinations for the King. I met with
him about three days after I came to
<hi>Reading,</hi> as he was coming from the
King then at <hi>Causum:</hi> He told me that
he had lately seen the tenderest sight
that ever his eyes beheld, which was
the Interview between the King and his
Children, and wept plentifully at the
remembrance of it, saying, That never
man was so abused as he in his sinister
opinions of the King, who he thought
was the uprightest and most conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
of his three Kingdoms; that they
of the Independent Party (as they were
called) had infinite Obligations to him
for not consenting to the <hi>Scots</hi> Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions
at <hi>Newcastle,</hi> which would have
totally ruined them, and which his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty's
Interest seemed to invite him to;
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:51505:15"/>
and concluded with me by wishing,
that God would be pleased to look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him according to the sincerity of his
heart towards his Majesty. I immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
acquainted his Majesty with this
Passage; who seemed not well edified
with it, an did believe that all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
out of the use <hi>Cromwel</hi> and the
Army had of his Majesty, without whom
he thought they could do nothing; and
this I conceive was inculcated daily by
<hi>Bampfield</hi> and <hi>Loe</hi> at first, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
by the Lord <hi>Lauderdale,</hi> who had
frequent Accesses to his Majesty from
the <hi>Scots,</hi> the Presbyterians, and the
City of <hi>London,</hi> who knew there was
nothing so fatal to them as a Conjunc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
between the King and the Army.
Out of all my Observations I drew these
Conclusions, which I prosecuted to the
best of my power: That his Majesty
was concerned to come to a speedy is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue
with the Army; that he might either
agree with them, or discover that they
intended not to agree with him; and
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:51505:15"/>
in that case that his Majesty should se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
his Escape, and in the mean time
that his Majesty should not give them
the least colour of exception to his Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
that seeing the Officers were more
easily fixed to his Majesty by a visible
prospect of their Interest in case of a
Conjunction, I took the least pains with
them, and applied my self to <hi>Peters</hi> and
the Adjutators, who sway'd their Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
more than their Officers command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them; and it was more hard to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy
them (being many) in point of
Interest, than their Officers who were
few.</p>
            <p>About ten days after my arrival at
the Army, the Contentions grew high
and hot between them and the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian
Party in the House, which was
the major part by much, and the City
of <hi>London;</hi> the one contending to have
the Parliament purged of corrupt Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
and the other to have the Army
removed farther from the City. This
caused the Army's March from <hi>Reading</hi>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:51505:16"/>
to <hi>Bedford,</hi> and consequently his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty's
Remove with his wonted Guard
from <hi>Causum</hi> to <hi>Woborn,</hi> a House of the
Earl of <hi>Bedford,</hi> where I procured his
Majesty a sight of the Army's Proposals
six or eight days before they were of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd
to him in publick. His Majesty
was much displeased with them in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,
saying, that if they had a mind
to close with him, they would never
impose so hard terms upon him. I replied,
That I should suspect them more than
I did (if they had demanded less) that
they did not intend really to serve his
Majesty, but only to abuse him, since
it was not likely that men who had
through so great Dangers and Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
acquir'd so great Advantages, should
ever sit down with less than was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
in the Proposals; and on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
side, never was a Crown so near
lost, so cheaply recover'd, as his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty's
would be, if they agreed upon such
terms. His Majesty was of another ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
and returned, That they could not
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:51505:16"/>
subsist without him, and therefore he did
not doubt but that he should see them
very shortly be glad to condescend
farther; and then objected to three par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
points of the Proposals. The
first was, The Exception of seven, not
named, from Pardon. The second,
the excluding his Party from being eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible
in the next ensuing Parliament.
And the third, That tho there was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
against the Church-Government
establish'd, yet there was nothing done
to assert it. To these I replied, That af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
his Majesty and the Army were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded,
it would be no impossible work to
make them remit in the first point; and
if he could not, when his Majesty was
reinstated in his Throne, he might easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
supply seven persons beyond the Seas
in such sort as to make their Banishment
supportable to them. To the second;
That the next Parliament would be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitated
to lay great burdens upon the
Kingdom, and it would be a happiness
to the King's Party to have no Voice in
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:51505:17"/>
them. To the third, That the Law
was Security enough for the Church,
and it was happy that men who had
fought against the Church, should be
reduced (when they were Superiours)
not to speak against it. His Majesty
broke from me with this expression,
Well! I shall see them glad 'ere long to
accept more equal terms. I now began
to long impatiently for <hi>Mr. Ashburnham,</hi>
as hoping he had some better Topicks
for his Majesty; and within few days af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
he arrived to his Majesty's great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment
as well as mine. His Instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
referr'd to mine, which we were to
prosecute jointly. I gave him presently
all the light I had, which he seemed to
embrace at first; but after he had dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coursed
more amply with his Majesty, I
found him so far from crossing him, that
he abounded in his Majesty's sense, and
held afterwards this discourse with me:
That for his part he was always bred
in the best Company, and therefore could
not converse with such sensless Fellows
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:51505:17"/>
as the Agitators were; that if we could
gain the Officers sure to the King, there
was no doubt but they would be able to
command their own Army, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he was resolved to apply himself
totally to them, and so did, and there
grew immediately great familiarities be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
him and <hi>Whalley</hi> Captain of the
Guard that waited on the King, and
then with <hi>Cromwel</hi> and <hi>Ireton;</hi> and daily
Messages between his Majesty and the
Head-Quarters, which <hi>Mr. Ashburnham</hi>
carried, and sometimes me with him,
tho I seldom knew the Message, at least
he would have me believe I did not; for
he chose to speak apart with <hi>Cromwel</hi> and
<hi>Ireton</hi> when I was present, alledging, that
they would not speak freely to two at
once. What with the pleasure of having
so concurring a Second as <hi>Mr. Ashburnham,</hi>
and what with the encouraging Messages
his Majesty had by my Lord <hi>Lauderdale,</hi>
and others from the Presbyterian Party
and the City of <hi>London,</hi> who pretended
to despise the Army, and to oppose them
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:51505:18"/>
to death, his Majesty seemed very much
erected; insomuch that when the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posals
were solemnly sent to him, and
his Concurrence most humbly and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly
desired, his Majesty (not only
to the astonishment of <hi>Ireton</hi> and the
rest, but even to mine) entertain'd
them with very tart and bitter Discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
saying sometimes, that he would
have no man to suffer for his sake, and
that he repented of nothing so much as
the Bill against the Lord <hi>Strafford;</hi>
which tho most true, was unpleasant for
them to hear; That he would have the
Church establish'd according to Law
by the Proposals. They replied, It
was none of their work to do it; that it
was enough for them to wave the point,
and they hoped enough for his Majesty
since he had waved the Government it
self in <hi>Scotland.</hi> His Majesty said that
he hoped God had forgiven him that Sin,
and repeated often, <hi>You cannot be without
me; You will fall to ruin if I do not sustain you.</hi>
Many of the Army that were present, and
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:51505:18"/>
wished well, at least as they pretended,
to the Agreement, look'd wishtly and
with wonder upon me and <hi>Mr. Ashburn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi>
and I as much as I durst upon his
Majesty, who would take no notice of
it, until I was forced to step to him and
whisper in his ear, <hi>Sir, your Majesty speaks
as if you had some secret strength and power
that I do not know of; and since your Majesty
hath concealed from me, I wish you had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed
it from these men too.</hi> His Majesty
soon recollected himself, and began to
sweeten his former Discourse with great
power of Language and Behavior. But
it was now of the latest. For Colonel
<hi>Rainsborough,</hi> who of all the Army
seemed the least to wish the Accord, in
the middle of the Conference stole away
and posted to the Army, which he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed
against the King with all the
artificial malice he had. As soon as the
Conference ended, I followed him to
<hi>Bedford,</hi> where the Army then lay. I
met with some of the Adjutators, who
ask'd me what his Majesty meant, to
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:51505:19"/>
entertain their Commissioners so harsh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly?
I told them, that <hi>Rainsborough</hi> had
delivered it amiss to them, as indeed he
had by adding to the truth. I then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired
a meeting with <hi>Ireton</hi> and the rest
of the superior Officers, and obtained
it, and there ask'd them, If the King
should grant the Proposals, what would
ensue? They replied, they would offer
them to the Parliament: But if they refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
them, what would they do then? they
replied, they would not tell me. I then
returned, that I would tell them, I
would lose no more time with them:
For if there came of Proposals but the
propounding, I could then propound as
well as they. They all replied, that it
was not for them to say directly what
they would do against the Parliament;
but intimated that they did not doubt to
be able to prevail with the Parliament.
When I appeared not fully satisfied with
this Reply, <hi>Rainsborough</hi> spoke out in
these words, <hi>If they will not agree, we will
make them;</hi> to which the whole Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:51505:19"/>
consented. But we had a harder
work with his Majesty, who was so far
from granting, that he sent for Sir <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas
Gardiner, Mr. Jeffry Palmer,</hi> and Sir
<hi>Orlando Bridgman,</hi> his learned Counsel,
Men indeed of great Abilities and Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity;
to these were added <hi>Mr. Philip
Warwick, Mr. Ashburnham, Mr. Denham,</hi>
Sir <hi>Richard Ford,</hi> Dr. <hi>Gough</hi> (who came
over with <hi>Mr. Ashburnham</hi> from <hi>France</hi>)
Dr. <hi>Sheldon,</hi> Dr. <hi>Hammond,</hi> and my self.
We easily answered the Proposals both
in point of Law and Reason. But we
had to do with what was stronger than
both.</p>
            <p>All this while there wanted not those
that mediated a better understanding be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Parliament and the Army;
but that not taking effect, the Army ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced
nearer <hi>London,</hi> and lodged at
<hi>Windsor,</hi> and his Majesty at <hi>Stoke.</hi> At
this time those that were supposed best
inclined to his Majesty in the Army, seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
much afflicted with his Majesty's back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardness
to concur with the Army in
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:51505:20"/>
the Proposals; and the rather, because
they conceived great hopes that within
few days they should be masters of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi>
which they doubted might alter the
temper of the Army towards the King.
<hi>Cromwel, Ireton,</hi> and the rest of the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior
Officers of the Army, knew that
<hi>London</hi> would certainly be theirs two
days before they communicated it to the
Army; and therefore sent an Express to
<hi>Mr. Ashburnham</hi> and to me, that since
his Majesty would not yield to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posals,
yet his Majesty should at least
send a kind Letter to the Army, before
it were commonly known that <hi>London</hi>
would submit. We caused a meeting
of the above-named persons at <hi>Windsor,</hi>
where the Letter was immediately
drawn: But his Majesty would not sign
it, till after three or four several De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates;
which lost one whole days time,
if not more. <hi>Mr. Ashburnham</hi> and I went
with it at last, and upon the way met
with Messages to hasten it. But before
we came to <hi>Syon,</hi> the Commissioners
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:51505:20"/>
from <hi>London</hi> were arrived, and our Letter
out of season; for tho his Majesty was
ignorant of the success when he signed the
Letter, yet coming after it was known,
it lost both the Grace and Efficacy. All
that the Officers could do, they did;
which was, whilst the Army was in the
Act of Thanksgiving to God for their
success, to propose that they should not
be elevated with it, but keep still to their
former Engagement to his Majesty, and
once more solemnly vote the Proposals;
which was accordingly done. The next
day the Army marched into <hi>London,</hi> and
some few of the Presbyterian Party, that
had been most active against the Army,
disappeared. From <hi>London,</hi> the Head-Quarters
came to <hi>Putney,</hi> and his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
was lodg'd at <hi>Hampton Court. Mr.
Ashburnham</hi> had daily some Message or
another from the King to <hi>Cromwel</hi> and
<hi>Ireton,</hi> who had enough to do both in
the Parliament and Council of the Army,
the one abounding with Presbyterians,
the other with Levellers, and both really
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:51505:21"/>
jealous that <hi>Cromwel</hi> and <hi>Ireton</hi> had made
a private Compact and Bargain with the
King; <hi>Lilburn</hi> printing books weekly to
that effect: and Sir <hi>Lewis Dives</hi> afterwards
acknowledged to me, that being his Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-prisoner,
he had daily endeavour'd
to possess him with that opinion, of which
altho he were not perswaded himself,
yet he judged it for the King's service to
divide <hi>Cromwel</hi> and the Army. On the
other side, the Presbyterians were no less
confident of their Surmises; and amongst
them, <hi>Cromwel</hi> told me, that my Lady
<hi>Carlisle</hi> affirmed, that I had said to her
Ladiship, that he was to be Earl of <hi>Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sex,</hi>
and Captain of the King's Guards.
I had the honour to be well known to
her Ladiship, but forbore, contrary to
my Duty and Inclination, to wait on
her, for fear of giving any Umbrage to
the Army, she being of the contrary par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
but having several Messages from
her Ladiship by my Lady <hi>Newport</hi> and
others, I waited on her. I was not long
there, but <hi>Arpin</hi> came into her Chamber,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:51505:21"/>
who was an Adjutator, and sent for, as
I conceived, to be an Eye-witness that I
was in my Lady <hi>Carlisle</hi>'s Chamber, tho
nothing pass'd but general Discourses;
and I should have ly'd if I had said any
thing to that purpose. But these and
like Discourses made great impression
on the Army; to which <hi>Mr. Ashburn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>'s
secret and long Conferences con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed
not a little; insomuch that the
Adjutators, who were wont to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
that <hi>Cromwel</hi> went too slow to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the King, began to suspect that
he had gone too fast, and left them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
him: From whence there were
frequent Complaints in the Council of
the Army, of the intimacy <hi>Mr. Ashburn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>
and I had in the Army; that <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel</hi>'s
and <hi>Ireton</hi>'s door was open to us
when it was shut to them; that they
knew not why Malignants should have
so much Countenance in the Army, and
Liberty with the King. These Discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
both in publick and private, <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel</hi>
seemed highly to be offended with;
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:51505:22"/>
and when he could carry any thing to
his Majesty's advantage amongst the
Adjutators, could not rest until he had
made us privately partakers of it; but
withal he told <hi>Mr. Ashburnham</hi> and me,
that if he were an honest man, he had
said enough of the sincerity of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions;
if he were not, nothing was
enough, and therefore conjur'd us, as
we tender'd his Majesty's Service, not
to come so frequently to his Quarters,
but send privately to him, the suspicions
of him being grown to that height, that
he was afraid to lie in his own Quarters.
But this had no operation upon <hi>Mr.
Ashburnham,</hi> who alledged, that we must
shew them the necessity of agreeing
with the King from their own Disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.</p>
            <p>About three weeks after the Army
had enter'd <hi>London,</hi> the <hi>Scots</hi> had prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with the Parliament for another so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn
Address to his Majesty, which was
performed in the old Propositions of
<hi>Newcastle,</hi> some Particulars in reference
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:51505:22"/>
to the <hi>Scots</hi> only excepted. The Army
was very unwiliing the King should
grant these Propositions, of which the
King advised with all the Persons above
mentioned, who were all of opinion, that
it was unsafe for his Majesty to close
with the Enemies of the Army whilst he
was in it; and therefore followed the
Advice of all the leading part of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent
Party both in the Parliament
and Army, by refusing the Articles, and
desiring a personal Treaty, whereof
his Majesty thought the Proposals a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
ground than the Articles, tho there
were something in them to which his
Majesty could not consent. We gave
our Friends in the Army a sight of this
Answer the day before it was sent, with
which they seemed infinitely satisfied,
and promised to use their utmost endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
to procure a personal Treaty, and
to my understanding perform'd it: for
both <hi>Cromwel</hi> and <hi>Ireton,</hi> with <hi>Vane</hi> and all
their Friends, seconded with great resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
this desire of his Majesty. But con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:51505:23"/>
to their and all mens expectation,
they found a most general opposition,
and that this Message of his Majesty had
confirmed the jealousy of their private
Agreement with the King; so that the
more it was urged by <hi>Cromwel,</hi> &amp;c. the
more it was rejected by the rest, who
looked on them as their Betrayers. The
Suspicions were so strong in the House,
that they lost almost all their Friends
there; and the Army that lay then about
<hi>Putney</hi> were no less ill satisfied: for
there came down shoals every day from
<hi>London</hi> of the Presbyterian and Levelling
Parties that fomented these Jealousies;
insomuch that <hi>Cromwel</hi> thought himself,
or pretended it, not secure in his own
Quarters. The Adjutators now begin
to change their Discourse, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained
openly in their Councils both
of the King and the Malignants a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
his Majesty. One of the first they
voted from him was my self. They
said, That since his Majesty had not
accepted of their Proposals, they were
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:51505:23"/>
not obliged any farther to them; that
they were obliged to consult their own
Safety, and the good of the Kingdom,
and to use such means towards both as
they should find rational: and because
they met with strong opposition from
<hi>Cromwel</hi> and <hi>Ireton,</hi> and most of the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior
Officers, and some even of the
Adjutators, they had many private so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn
meetings in <hi>London,</hi> where they
humbled themselves before the Lord,
and sought his good pleasure, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired
that he would be pleased to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal
it to his Saints, which they inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret
those to be who are most violent
or Zealous (as they call it) in the work
of the Lord. These found it apparent
that God had on the one side hardned
the King's heart, and blinded his eyes, in
not passing the Proposals, whereby they
were absolved from offering them any
more; and on the other side, the Lord
had led Captivity captive, and put all
things under their feet, and therefore
they were bound to finish the Work of
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:51505:24"/>
the Lord, which was to alter the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
according to their first De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign:
and to this end they resolved to
seize the King's Person, and take him
out of <hi>Cromwel</hi>'s hands. These Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
struck so great a Terror into <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel</hi>
and <hi>Ireton,</hi> with others of the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
that we supposed best affected to
us, that they were of opinion the Army
should be drawn to a Rendezvouz, and
their endeavours used to engage them
once more to adhere to the Proposals.
As soon as the tumultuous part of the
Army had notice of it, they resolved
before the day of the Rendezvouz to
seize the King's Person. I had been
now about three weeks removed from
the King, and about a fortnight after
me <hi>Mr. Ashburnham. Mr. Leg</hi> still re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained
with his Majesty, and waited
in his Bed-chamber.</p>
            <p>About eight or ten days before
the time appointed for the drawing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
of the Army, <hi>Mr. Ashburnham</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited
me from <hi>London,</hi> and <hi>Mr. Leg</hi> from
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:51505:24"/>
               <hi>Hampton Court,</hi> to dine with him on a
Sunday at <hi>Ditton,</hi> being the other side
of the Water. They were both there
long before me, and I a good while be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
dinner. But just as Dinner was
ready to come in, they took me aside in
the room, and told me that his Majesty
was really afraid of his Life by the tumul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
part of the Army, and was resolv'd
to make his escape; and that they had
order from his Majesty to command me
in his name to wait on his Majesty in his
intended Escape. I replied, It was a
great honor, and accompanied with not
a little danger; but withal it was new
to me, and therefore nothing occur'd
to my thoughts at present but two
things: the first was, that I thought it
absolutely necessary that <hi>Mr. Ashburn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi>
who kept the King's mony, should
immediately employ his Servant <hi>Dutton,</hi>
who was well acquainted with the Coast,
to provide three or four Ships in several
Ports, to be ready in all events; the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond,
that I also might receive his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty's
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:51505:25"/>
commands immediately from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.
To the first they seemed to concur,
but nothing was ever done in it, which
to this day amazes me. The other was
effected, and I went the <hi>Tuesday</hi> night af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to <hi>Hampton Court</hi> privately, being intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
a back way by <hi>Mr. Leg.</hi> The King
told me he was afraid of his Life, and that
he would have me assist in person in his
escape. I asked which way his Majesty
would go? his Majesty replied, that both
<hi>Mr. Ashburnham,</hi> who was present, and
I should know that by <hi>Will. Leg.</hi> The
<hi>Monday</hi> before, <hi>Mr. Ashburnham</hi> and I went
to the Head-Quarters, to desire Passes to
return beyond the Seas; and by the way
back he told me, that the <hi>Scots</hi> had much
tampering with the King, but could
come to no Agreement; that they would
fain have his Majesty out of the Army,
and to that end had much augmented
his just fears; and therefore ask'd me
what I thought of his Majesty's coming
privately to <hi>London,</hi> and appearing in
the House of Lords? I replied, Very
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:51505:25"/>
ill; because the Army were absolutely
masters both of the City and Parliament,
and would undoubtedly seize his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty;
and if there should be but two
Swords drawn in the scuffle, they would
accuse his Majesty of beginning a new
War, and proceed with him according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
He then ask'd me what I thought of
the <hi>Isle of Wight?</hi> I replied, better than of
<hi>London;</hi> tho I knew nothing of it, nor
who was Governor. He replied, that he
had had some communication with the
Governor of late, and conceived good
hopes of him, but had no assurance from
him. I then ask'd him, Why his Majesty
would not make his Retreat secure by
quitting the Kingdom? He replied, not
for two Reasons; the first was, the
Rendevouz would be a week after, and
his Majesty was not willing to quit the
Army before that were passed; because
if the Superior Officers prevailed, they
would be able to make good their pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Engagement; if they were overtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped,
they must apply themselves to the
King for their own security. The se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:51505:26"/>
was, that the <hi>Scots</hi> were in Treaty
with the King, and well nigh a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion,
which they would never come
to, but out of their desires to separate
the King and the Army; that if the
King went before, they would hold
him to impossible Conditions, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
his Majesty was resolved to conclude
with them first. In which advice <hi>Mr. Ash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burnham</hi>
was most positive, and told me
often, that the World would laugh at
us if we quitted the Army before we had
agreed with the <hi>Scots;</hi> and let them, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
I, so his Majesty be secure. On
the <hi>Wednesday,</hi> as I take it, we had Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
to send spare Horses to <hi>Sutton</hi> in
<hi>Hampshire,</hi> a place where I never had
been; and the <hi>Thursday</hi> after, his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty,
with <hi>Will. Leg,</hi> came out at the clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
of the evening, and immediately
went towards <hi>Oatlands,</hi> and so through
the Forest, where his Majesty was our
Guide; but lost our way, tho he were
well acquainted with it, the night be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
excessively dark and stormy. When
his Majesty fat first out, he discoursed
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:51505:26"/>
long with <hi>Mr. Ashburnham,</hi> and at last cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
me to him, and complained very
much of the <hi>Scots</hi> Commissioners, who
were the first that presented his Dangers
to him, and offer'd him Expedients for
his escape; but when he came to make
use of those they had offer'd, they were
fullest of Objections; saying, that his
coming into <hi>London</hi> was desperate, his
hiding in <hi>England</hi> chimerical, and his
escape to <hi>Jersey</hi> prevented, because my
Ship was discovered; which particular
my Lord <hi>Lanerick</hi> affirmed. The King
thereupon ask'd me, if I had ever a Ship
ready? I answered, that I neither had
not could have any, having not one pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of mony; that I had desir'd <hi>Mr. Ash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burnham</hi>
earnestly to make provision, but
knew not what he had done in it. The
King then ask'd me, what I thought might
be the reason they should say I had one,
and that discovered, if I had none? I
replied, It was hard for me to affirm
what was their meaning in that particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,
or in general in their proceeding
with his Majesty: but I did conjecture,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:51505:27"/>
they were very desirous to have his
Majesty out of the Army, which made
them present his Dangers to him so
frequently as they had done: and in
the next place they desired that his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
should put himself again into their
hands, but wanted confidence, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd
it would be ineffectual to move
it directly to his Majesty, because they
had given so ill an account when he
was last with them; and therefore they
objected against their own Expedients
of coming into <hi>London,</hi> and obscuring
himself in <hi>England.</hi> And because they
could find no other against his going to
<hi>Jersey,</hi> they pretended that I had a Ship
discovered; believing perhaps that I
was totally separated from his Majesty,
and so should not have had any occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to contradict it; and by this means
his Majesty being excluded all other
means of escape, should have been ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitated
to make use of <hi>Scotland.</hi> His
Majesty laid his hand upon my shoulder
and said, I think thou art in the right,
and believed it afterward more confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:51505:27"/>
than I did. I then ask'd his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty
which way he would go. His Majesty
replied, that he hoped to be at <hi>Sutton</hi>
three hours before day, and that while our
Horses were making ready, we would
consider what course to take. But what
by the length and illness of the way,
the darkness of the night, and going at
least ten miles out of our way, it was
day-break when we came to our Inn at
<hi>Sutton,</hi> where our Servant came out to
us, and told us there was a Committee
of the County sitting about the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
business. His Majesty thereupon
sent for our Horses out, and we conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
our way towards <hi>Southampton;</hi>
and his Majesty resolved that we four
should walk down the next hill with our
Horses in our hands, and as we walked
consult what we were to do. Then I
inquir'd if <hi>Mr. Ashburnham</hi> had gotten a
Ship, and finding he had not, I proposed
going farther West, where I was sure I
had some Friends would favour our
escape: and here again I found the two
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:51505:28"/>
reasons prevail, of not leaving the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
before the Rendevouz was passed,
and the Treaty with the <hi>Scots</hi> finished.
His Majesty resolved (and that the first
time for ought I could then discover) to
go for the <hi>Isle of VVight,</hi> whither he or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
<hi>Mr. Ashburnham</hi> and me to go with
these Instructions, by word of mouth, to
the Governor <hi>Hammond,</hi> and return to
his Majesty, who went with <hi>Will. Leg</hi> to
a house of my Lord <hi>Southampton</hi> at
<hi>Titchfield;</hi> that we should carry him a
Copy of the Letter his Majesty left be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
him at <hi>Hampton Court,</hi> and of two
Letters sent to him, one from <hi>Cromwel,</hi>
the other without a name. <hi>Cromwels</hi> and
the other Letter contained great appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension
and fears of the ill intentions of
the Levelling party in the Army and City
against his Majesty; and that from <hi>Cromwel</hi>
added, that in prosecution thereof a new
Guard was the next day to be put upon
his Majesty of that party. His Majesty's
Letter contain'd his distrust of the disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly
part of the Army, and his neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:51505:28"/>
thereupon of providing for his own
safety, which he would so do as not to
desert the Interest of the Army: that in
order thereunto we should let the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor
know, that of all the Army his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
had made choice of him to put
himself upon, as a person of a good
Extraction, and one, that tho he had
been enagaged against him in the War,
yet it had been prosecuted by him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any animosity to his Person, to
which he had been informed he had no
aversion: only his Majesty, that he
might not surprize him, thought fit to
send us before to advertise him, and
to desire his <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> protect his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
and his Servants to the best of his
power; and if it should happen that
he might not be able to do it, then
the Governor should <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> himself to
leave us in as good a condition as he
found us, that is, suffer us to make
our escape. With these Instructions
we parted: but before I had gone ten
yards, I return'd to his Majesty, and
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:51505:29"/>
said, I had no knowledg of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor,
and therefore could not tell
whether he might not detain us in the
Island; and therefore advis'd his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty,
if we came not to him by the
next day, that his Majesty should think
no more of us, but secure his own es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape.
His Majesty thank'd me for the
Caution, and pursued his way, and
<hi>Mr. Ashburnham</hi> and I ours. The first
thing we resolved was, that since his
Majesty went towards the East side of
the Island, that we would go on the
West, to a place called <hi>Limington,</hi> where
<hi>Mr. Ashburnham</hi> told me there was a short
passage over. By the way I ask'd <hi>Mr.
Ashburnham</hi> if he had any acquaintance
with <hi>Hammond</hi> the Governor. He replied,
not very much, yet he had lately had
some discourse with him upon the High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
near <hi>Kingston,</hi> and found him not ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
averse to his Majesty; but that which
made him conceive the best hopes of him
was the Character <hi>Mr. Denham,</hi> and the
Commendations my Lady <hi>Isabella Thynn</hi>
               <pb n="57" facs="tcp:51505:29"/>
gave of him. We came to <hi>Limington</hi>
that night, but could not pass, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of a violent Storm that blew. The
next morning we got over, and had
then eight miles to the Castle of <hi>Caris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broke,</hi>
where the Governor dwelt. We
came thither after ten in the morning,
and found the Governor was newly
gone out towards <hi>Newport.</hi> When we
overtook him, <hi>Mr. Ashburnham</hi> desir'd
me to open the matter to him, which he
would afterwards second himself. After
I had saluted him, I took him aside,
and deliver'd our message to him word
for word. But he grew so pale, and
fell into such a trembling, that I did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
believe he would have fallen off his
Horse: which trembling continu'd with
him at least an hour after, in which he
broke out into passionate and distracted
Expressions, sometimes saying, O Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen!
you have undone me by bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the King into the Island, if at least
you have brought him; and if you
have not, pray let him not come: for
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:51505:30"/>
what between my Duty to his Majesty,
and my Gratitude for this fresh obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
of Confidence, and my obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
my Trust to the Army, I shall be
confounded: otherwhile he would talk
to a quite contrary purpose. I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
to settle him the better, I said,
That, God be thanked, there was no
harm done; that his Majesty intended
a Favour to him and his Posterity, in
giving him an occasion to lay a great
obligation upon him, and such as was
very consisting with his relation to the
Army, who had so solemnly engaged
themselves to his Majesty: but if he
thought otherwise, his Majesty would
be far from imposing his Person upon
him. To that he replied, That then
if his Majesty should come to any mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance,
what would the Army and
Kingdom say to him, that had refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to receive him? To this I replied,
That he did not refuse him, who was
not come to him. He returned, That
he must needs know where his Majesty
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:51505:30"/>
was, because he knew where we were.
I told him he was never the nearer for
my part. He then began a little to
sweeten, and to wish that his Majesty
would have reposed himself absolutely
upon him, because it would have been
much the better for both. I then went
to <hi>Mr. Ashburnham,</hi> and told him, that
this Governor was not a man for our
purpose, and that for my part I would
never give my consent that his Majesty
should trust him. <hi>Mr. Ashburnham</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg'd
that he did not like him;
yet on the other side, he much feared
what would become of his Majesty if
he should be discovered before he had
made his point, and made appear what
his intention was; for then he would
be accused of what his Enemies pleased
to lay upon him. I replied, That if
we returned not that night, his Majesty
would be gone to Sea. I perceived
Mr. <hi>Ashburnham</hi> liked not that so well,
and therefore took the Governor to
task apart, and after some Conference
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:51505:31"/>
they came both to me; and the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor
said, that since we desired it, he
would say, that because he believed
his Majesty had made choice of him
as a person of Honour and Honesty, to
lay this great Trust upon, therefore he
would not deceive his Majesty's expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.
I replied, That Expression was
too general, and did not come home
to our Instructions. He then made
many Discourses not much to the
purpose, during which time he kept
himself between <hi>Mr. Ashburnham</hi> and
me; and when he found me still
unsatisfied, he added, that I was harder
to content than <hi>Mr. Ashburnham,</hi> and
he did believe that his Majesty would be
much easier pleas'd than either, and
thereupon concluded that I should go in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Castle, and that <hi>Mr. Ashburnham</hi>
should take his Horse and go to the
King, and tell his Majesty what he said.
I embraced the motion most readily,
and immediately went over the Birdg
into the Castle, tho I had the Image of
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:51505:31"/>
the Gallows very perfectly before me.
<hi>Mr. Ashburnham</hi> went, I believe, with a
better heart to horse; but before he was
gone half a flight shot, the Governor
(being before the Castle gate) called
to him, and had a conference of at least
a quarter of an hour with him, to what
purpose I never knew until I came into
<hi>Holland,</hi> where a Gentleman of good
Worth and Quality told me, that the
Governor affirmed afterwards in <hi>London</hi>
and in many places, that he then offer'd
to <hi>Mr. Ashburnham,</hi> that I should go and
he should stay, as believing his Majesty
to be less willing to expose him than me,
but that <hi>Mr. Ashburnham</hi> absolutely refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed.
Whatever passed between them, I
am sure they came both back to me;
and the Governor putting himself be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
us said, that he would say that
which he was sure ought to content any
reasonable man, which was, that he did
believe his Majesty relied on him as on a
person of Honor and Honesty, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he did engage himself to us to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:51505:32"/>
whatever could be expected from
a person of Honor and Honesty. Before
I could make any, <hi>Mr. Ashburnham</hi>
made this reply, <hi>I will ask no more.</hi> The
Governor then added, let us then all go
to the King, and acquaint him with it.
<hi>Mr. Ashburnham</hi> answered, with all my
heart. I then broke from the Governor
who held me in his hand, and went to
<hi>Mr. Ashburnham</hi> and said, What do you
mean, to carry this man to the King be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
you know whether he will approve
of this Undertaking or no? undoubtedly
you will surprize him. <hi>Mr. Ashburnham</hi>
said nothing but, <hi>I'll warrant you:</hi> and so
you shall, said I; for you know the
King much better than I do, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
when we shall come where the
King is, I assure you I will not see him
before you have satisfied his Majesty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
your proceeding. Well; he
would take that upon him. I then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired
he would not let the Governor carry
any with him, that in all events we
might the more easily secure him, which
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:51505:32"/>
he consented to. Nevertheless when
we came to <hi>Cows</hi> Castle, where we
were to take boat, <hi>Hammond</hi> took <hi>Bas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket</hi>
the Governor of the Castle along
with him; and when I complained of it
to <hi>Mr. Ashburnham,</hi> he answer'd, It was
no matter, we should be able to do well
enough with them two. When we came
to <hi>Titchfield,</hi> my Lord of <hi>Southamptons</hi>
House, <hi>Mr. Ashburnham</hi> according to his
promise went up to the King, and left
me below with <hi>Hammond</hi> and <hi>Basket.</hi> I
afterwards understood, that when <hi>Mr.
Ashburnham</hi> had given an Account of our
message and the Governors answer, and
came to say that he was come along with
us to make good what he had promised,
his Majesty struck himself upon the breast
and said, What! have you brought
<hi>Hammond</hi> with you? O, you have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done
me; for I am by this means
made fast from stirring. <hi>Mr. Ashburn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>
replied, That if he mistrusted <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond,</hi>
he would undertake to secure him.
His Majesty said, I understand you
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:51505:33"/>
well enough, but the World would not
him; if he should follow that Counsel,
it would be said and believed that he
ventured his Life for him, and that he
had unworthily taken it from him. No,
it was too late now of thinking any
thing, but going through the way he
had forced him upon, and leave the Issue
to God. But when his Majesty began
anew to wonder that he could make so
great an oversight, <hi>Mr. Ashburnham</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
no more to reply, wept bitterly.
In the mean time <hi>Hammond</hi> and <hi>Bas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket</hi>
were so impatient at this long stay
below in the Court, that I was forced
to send a Gentleman of my Lord <hi>South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ampton,</hi>
to desire that his Majesty and <hi>Mr.
Ashburnham</hi> would remember that we
were below. About half an hour after,
we were sent for up; but before <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi>
and <hi>Basket</hi> kiss'd his hand, his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
took me aside and said, Sir <hi>John
Berkley,</hi> I hope you are not so passionate
as <hi>Jack Ashburnham:</hi> do you think you
have followed my directions? I answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:51505:33"/>
no indeed Sir, but it is none of my
fault, as <hi>Mr. Ashburnham</hi> can tell you
if he please; I have exposed my life
to prevent it; and then told his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
the sum of what had pass'd, and
particularly of my being a Prisoner in
the Castle, and of <hi>Mr. Ashburnham</hi>'s com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
away without me, which <hi>Mr. Ash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burnham</hi>
had omitted. His Majesty
judg'd that it was now too late to bog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle,
and therefore received <hi>Hammond</hi>
cheerfully, who promised more to his
Majesty than he had done to us, and
we all went over that night to the <hi>Cows.</hi>
In the morning his Majesty went with
the Governor to <hi>Carisbroke,</hi> and was
met by the way with divers Gentlemen
of the Island, by whom we learnt that
we were more fortunate than we were
aware of; for the whole Island was u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimously
for the King except the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors
of the Castles and <hi>Hammond</hi>'s
Captains; that there were but twelve
old Men in the Castle, who had served
under the Earl of <hi>Portland,</hi> and were all
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:51505:34"/>
well affected; that <hi>Hammond</hi> might be
easily gained if not more easily forced,
the Castle being day and night full of
Loyal Subjects and Servants of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty;
and his Majesty having daily li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
to ride abroad, might chuse his
own time of quitting the Island. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
not only his Majesty and all that
were about him, but those that were
at a further distance, approved by their
Letters this resolution of his Majesty.
Both his Majesty and <hi>Mr. Ashburnham</hi>
attackt the Governor, and I think very
prosperously, for both he and his Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
seem'd to desire nothing of his
Majesty, but that he would send a Civil
Message to the Houses, signifying his
propension to Peace, which was done
to their Satisfaction. Three days after
our coming to the Island, a Messenger
was sent by the Parliament for <hi>Mr.
Ashburnham,</hi> Sir <hi>John Berkley</hi> and <hi>Mr. Leg,</hi>
but the Governor refused to let us go.
The fifth day after our arrival we heard
that in the Rendevouz of the Army, the
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:51505:34"/>
superior Officers had carried it, and that
one or two were shot, and eleven more
of the mutinying Levellers made Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners.
This made us bless God for the
resolution of coming into the Island:
and now <hi>Mr. Ashburnham</hi> and the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor
were frequent and fervent in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
conferences, and as I have heard
came to particulars of accommodation
for him, in case of the King's recovery:
Insomuch that now the Governor seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
sollicitous of nothing so much, as
that the Army should resume its wonted
discipline, and clear themselves of their
importunate and impertinent Adjutators,
of whose Authority in the Army he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
approved, and therefore sent his
Chaplain immediately to the Army
to conjure them to make use of their Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
upon the Adjutators. Two or
three days after, he moved earnestly,
that his Majesty would send one of us
three to the Army with colourable Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
to the General; but that he should
write with confidence to <hi>Cromwel</hi> and
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:51505:35"/>
               <hi>Ireton,</hi> to whom he would also write,
and did, conjuring them by their En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement,
by their Interest, by their
Honor, and their Consciences, to come to
a speedy close with the King, and not
to expose themselves still to the fantastick
giddiness of the Adjutators. My two
Comrades were very well contented
that I should go this Voyage, which I did
not without some apprehension of the
event as to my own particular. His
Majesty charged me to require <hi>Will. Ash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burnham</hi>
to provide a ship for him upon
the Coast of <hi>Sussex:</hi> But <hi>Mr. Ashburn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>
thought not fit I should be furnish'd
with mony for that, or for my journy.
I desired that in case the Army should
not intend well, I might have Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
to the <hi>Scots,</hi> but <hi>Mr. Ashburnham</hi>
did not think it fit. I then took a Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sin
German of mine with me, one <hi>Mr.
Henry Berkley</hi> Son to Sir <hi>Henry Berkley,</hi>
and procured a Pass from the Governor
of the <hi>Cows</hi> for his return within four
or five days, which had been other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:51505:35"/>
forgotten. Between <hi>Bagshot</hi> and
<hi>Windsor</hi> (then the Head-Quarters) I
met <hi>Traughton</hi> the Governor's Chaplain,
who told me he could carry no good
news back, the Army being as yet
come to no resolution as to the King.
As I was half way between <hi>Bagshot</hi> and
<hi>Windsor,</hi> Cornet <hi>Joyce</hi> a great Adjutator,
and he that had taken the King from
<hi>Holmby,</hi> overtook me. He seemed
much to wonder that I durst adventure
to come to the Army. Upon my dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses
with him I found, that it had
been discoursed among the Adjutators,
whether for their justification the King
ought not to be brought to a Tryal,
which he held in the affirmative, not
that he would have one hair of his Head
suffer, but that they might not bear the
blame of the War. I was quickly weary
of his discourse; but I perceived he
would not leave me until he saw me
in <hi>Windsor,</hi> and knew where I lodg'd.
About an hour after, I went to the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral's
Quarters, and found a General
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:51505:36"/>
meeting of the Officers there. After an
hours waiting I was admitted, and after
I had deliver'd my Compliment and
Letters to the General, I was desired to
withdraw; and having attended half an
hour, I was call'd in. The General look'd
very severely upon me, and after his man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
said, That they were the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment's
Army, and therefore could not
say anything to his Majesty's motion of
peace, but must refer those matters to
them, to whom they would send his
Majesty's Letters. I then look'd about
upon <hi>Cromwel</hi> and <hi>Ireton,</hi> and the rest of
my acquaintance, who saluted me very
coldly, and had their Countenance quite
changed towards me, and shewed me
<hi>Hammonds</hi> Letter, which I had deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd
to them, and smiled with much
disdain upon it. I saw that was no place
for me, and therefore went to my Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
where I staid from four until six, and
none of my acquaintance came at me,
which appeared sad enough. At last I
sent my Servant out, and wish'd him to
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:51505:36"/>
see if he could light upon any of my
acquaintance. At last he met with
one that was a General Officer, who
whispered in his ear, and bad him tell
me, that he would meet me at twelve
at night in a Close behind the <hi>Garter</hi>
Inn. I came at the hour, and he not
long after. I ask'd him what News?
and he replied, None good; and then
continued this Discourse.  <q>You know
that I and my Friend engaged ourselves
to you; that we were zealous
for an Agreement, and if the rest
were not so, we were abused;
that if there was an intention to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen
us, it would not be long hid from
us; that whatever we should disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
should not be secret to you; that
we, since the Tumults of the Army,
did mistrust <hi>Cromwel,</hi> and not long
after <hi>Ireton,</hi> whereof I informed you.
I come now to tell you, that we mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trust
neither, but know them and all
of us to be the archest Villains in the
World; for we are resolved notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:51505:37"/>
our Engagements, to destroy
the King and his Posterity; to which
end <hi>Ireton</hi> made two Propositions this
Afternoon, one that you should be sent
prisoner to <hi>London;</hi> the other, that none
should speak with you upon pain of
death: and I do hazard my Life now
by doing of it. The way that is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to ruin the King, is to send
eight hundred of the most disaffected
of the Army to secure his Person, as
believing him not so now, and then
bring him to a Tryal, and I dare think
no farther. This will be done in ten
days; and therefore if the King can
escape, let him do it as he loves his
Life.</q> I then inquired what was the
reason of this horrid change; what had
the King done to deserve it: He said,
nothing, and that to our grief; for we
would leap at any advantage against
him; I have pleaded hard against this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution
this day, but have bin laught
at for my pains. Well, but still, why
is this horrid perfidiousness resolved on,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:51505:37"/>
since there appears no occasion for it,
the Officers being superiors at the Ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>devouz?
He could not tell certainly,
but he conceived this to be the ground
of it, <q> That tho one of the Mutineers
was shot at the late Rendevouz, and
eleven made Prisoners, and the rest
in appearance overquell'd, yet they
were so far from being so indeed,
that there hath been with <hi>Cromwel</hi>
and <hi>Ireton,</hi> one after another, two
third parts of the Army to tell them,
that tho they were certainly to perish
in the Attempt, they would leave
nothing unessay'd to bring the whole
Army to their sense; and if all fail'd,
they would make a Division in the
Army, and join with any that would
assist in the Destruction of their Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posers:
<hi>Cromwel</hi> and <hi>Ireton</hi> therefore
argued thus; If the Army divide,
the greatest part will join with the
Presbyterians, and will, in all likeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,
prevail to our ruin, and we
shall be forced to make Applications
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:51505:38"/>
to the King, wherein we shall rather
crave than offer any Assistance; and
when his Majesty shall give it us,
and afterwards have the good fortune
to prevail, if he shall then pardon
us, it is all we can pretend to, and
more than we can promise our selves;
and thereupon concluded, That if we
cannot bring the Army to our sense,
we must go to theirs, a Schism be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
evidently destructive: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Cromwel</hi> bent all his Thoughts to
make his peace with the Party that
was most opposite to the King, in
which <hi>Peters</hi> was instrumental. He
acknowledg'd (as he had formerly
done upon the like occasion) that
the Glories of the World had so daz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
his eyes, that he could not discern
clearly the great Works the Lord was
doing; that he was resolved to hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
himself, and desire the Prayers
of the Saints, that God would be
pleased to forgive him his Self-seeking.
These Arts, together with comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:51505:38"/>
Messages to the Prisoners, that
they should be of good cheer, for no
harm should befal them since it had
pleased God to open his eyes, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
his Reconciliation, and he was
reinstated in the Fellowship of the
Faithful.</q> I then ask'd this Gentleman
whether I should not endeavour to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver
my Letters from the King to <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel</hi>
and <hi>Ireton:</hi> he replied, by all means,
lest they should mistrust I had discover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them.</p>
            <p>As soon as I came to my Lodging
I dispatch'd my Cousin <hi>Harry Berkley</hi>
to the <hi>Isle of Wight</hi> with two Letters;
the one containing a general Relation
and doubtful Judgment of things in
the Army, which I intended should be
shewn to the Governor; the other was
in Cypher, wherein I gave a particular
account of this Conference, naming the
Person, and concluding with a most
passionate Supplication to his Majesty to
meditate nothing but his immediate E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scape.
The next morning I sent Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:51505:39"/>
               <hi>Cook</hi> to <hi>Cromwel,</hi> to let him know
that I had Letters and Instructions to
him from the King. He sent me word
by the same Messenger, that he durst
not see me, it being very dangerous to
us both, and bid me be assured, that
he would serve his Majesty as long as
he could do it without his own ruin;
but desired that I would not expect that
he should perish for his sake. As soon
as I had this answer, I took horse for
<hi>London,</hi> with this resolution, not to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint
any man with the intentions of
the Army, nor of his Majesty's intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
escape, which I presumed would be
within few days, the Wind serving, and
the Queen having sent a ship to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
and pressed it earnestly by her let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.
The next day after my arrival at
<hi>London</hi> I had a letter from my Lord
<hi>Lanerick</hi> and Lord <hi>Lauderdale,</hi> desiring a
meeting with me, as presuming I had
a Commission to treat with them from
his Majesty. At our meeting they won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
to find the contrary. In my dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:51505:39"/>
with them I happen'd to say,
The last words his Majesty said to me
at parting were, that whatever I should
undertake to any person in his name,
his Majesty would make it good in the
word of a King. My Lord <hi>Lanerick</hi>
thereupon replied, that he would ask
no more Commission for me, believing
it to be true, both because I affirmed it,
and because he had received the like from
his Majesty upon the like occasion.
Our first conference was interrupted
through my Lord <hi>Lauderdale</hi>'s vehement
indignation against the Letter of <hi>Mr.
Ashburnham</hi> to the Speaker, wherein he
had this passage, <hi>That he would not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
his Honor to the discretion of either Scot
or Adjutator.</hi> This Letter was written
by <hi>Mr. Ashburnham</hi> before I left the
Island, upon the occasion of <hi>Whalleys</hi>
complaint to the House of Commons,
that <hi>Mr. Ashburnham</hi> had broken his
Engagement with him at his first com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to <hi>Woburn,</hi> wherein he undertook
that the King should not leave the Army
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:51505:40"/>
without his Knowledg and Consent.
Dr. <hi>Sheldon,</hi> Dr. <hi>Hammond, Mr. Leg</hi>
and I, objected hard against this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression;
but <hi>Mr. Ashburnham</hi> lik'd it so
well, that we could not make him de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
from it. On the <hi>Friday</hi> after, we
had another meeting, wherein we dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coursed
our selves well towards an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement,
and resolved on <hi>Monday</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
to conclude one way or other.
The next day, being <hi>Saturday,</hi> I had a
Letter from <hi>Mr. Ashburnham,</hi> requiring
me in his Majesty's name, to lay by
all other business whatsoever, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
instantly to his Majesty. I sent
therefore my Excuse to my Lords <hi>Lane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick</hi>
and <hi>Lauderdale,</hi> and went that night
out of Town, which they took very
ill, tho they had no reason for it; for
I would as willingly have excused my
Journy as they, as believing it was
only to assist in his Majesty's Escape:
for I had more than once observ'd, that
tho Mr. <hi>Ashburnham</hi> were willing enough
to appropriate Employments of Honor
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:51505:40"/>
and Profit, yet he was contented to
communicate those of Danger with his
Friends. The next morning I was with
his Majesty, who received me more
graciously than ordinary, and told me
that he had always a good opinion of
my Honesty and Discretion, but was
never so much confirmed in it, as by
my dispatch from <hi>VVindsor,</hi> for which
his Majesty thank'd me. After I had
return'd my Acknowledgments for his
Majesty's Favor, I ask'd, if his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty
approved the Advice so well, why
did he not follow it? Why was he
still in the Island? where he could not
long promise himself the Liberty he
now had, since there were Forces de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign'd,
both by Sea and Land, to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
his Person. His Majesty replied,
that he would have a care of that time
enough, and that he was to conclude
with the <hi>Scots</hi> before he left the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
because from their desire to have
him out of the Armies hands, they
would take reason; whereas if he went
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:51505:41"/>
before, they would never treat with
him but upon their own terms: and
in this opinion <hi>Mr. Ashburnham</hi> fully
concurred with his Majesty. Against
this I argued the best I could, and when
I saw it was in vain, I desired his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
would dispatch this Treaty, for
his condition would admit no delays.
His Majesty then order'd me to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw
with <hi>Mr. Ashburnham,</hi> Dr. <hi>Sheldon,</hi>
Dr. <hi>Hammond,</hi> and <hi>Mr. Leg,</hi> to see how far
his Majesty had gone in a Treaty with
the <hi>Scots.</hi> This Treaty had bin mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
in <hi>London</hi> by Dr. <hi>Gough,</hi> who in the
Queens name conjured his Majesty to
make his speedy escape, in all his Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
and in his own name beseech'd his
Majesty not to insist upon nice terms
in this present exigence of his affairs.
But <hi>Mr. Ashburnham</hi> refined much upon
several expressions of the Articles, that
concerned the Covenant, and Church
of <hi>England,</hi> of which he was a great
Professor, and made many replies and
alterations, and moved Messenger to be
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:51505:41"/>
sent after Messenger about it, and at
last insisted, that the King would send
for the <hi>Scots</hi> Commissioners to come to
him. The next day I fell sick, what
with my late journying, and what with
my vexation at this slow way of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding.
The day following I went
to his Majesty, and as soon as I could
be admitted spoke to him in these
words: <hi>Sir, if you make no more hast than
you do, I doubt you will not be able to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
your Escape; and therefore I humbly
beseech your Majesty to make two Papers
or Draughts, the one containing the utmost
extent of what your Majesty will give the</hi>
Scots, <hi>and sign it; and at the same time
send another containing the least you will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
of them, and let the</hi> Scots <hi>sign and
deliver that to Dr.</hi> Gough <hi>at the same
time that he shall deliver your Majesty's Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessions
to them, and provide instantly for
your Safety.</hi> About the middle of this
discourse with the King, <hi>Mr. Ash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burnham</hi>
came in, and when I had end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
very graciously smiling said, That
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:51505:42"/>
this Proposition was good if it were
practicable, which it was not; for
tho the <hi>Scots</hi> should agree to the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of all the Articles, yet they and
all men else would have their several
senses concerning the expressions, which
must be satisfied, or no Agreement
made, and therefore concluded that
the <hi>Scots</hi> were to be sent for. To
this I replied, that <hi>Mr. Ashburnham</hi> had
much reason ordinarily speaking for
what he objected; but his Majesty's
danger made this a very extraordinary
Case. His reasons carried it clear,
and Sir <hi>William Flemming</hi> or <hi>Mr. Mungo
Murray</hi> (for they both went and came
by turns) was sent to invite the <hi>Scots</hi>
Commissioners to come to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty.
The next day after his depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
in the evening, the King called
me to him and told me, I think you
are a Prophet; for the <hi>Scots</hi> Commissio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
at <hi>London</hi> have sent an Express, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siring
me to do the same thing in effect
you had moved, but that it was now
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:51505:42"/>
too late, for they would be come
away before another Express could
be gone out of the Island towards them.
I replied, that our concurrence was
accidental, for I had not the least In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence
with the <hi>Scots</hi> Commissio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners;
but when I saw there was no
remedy, I applied my self to what
was next the best I could. And God
knows there was work enough for
abler men than any of us were: for at
the same time the Scots were coming
to the King, there were also Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioners
sent by the Parliament to his
Majesty with offers of a Treaty, upon
condition that his Majesty as a pledg
of his future sincerity, would grant four
Preliminary Bills, which they had
brought ready drawn to his Majesty's
hands. The first contained the Revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of all Proclamations and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarations
against the Parliament,
wherein his Majesty made himself ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly
the Author of the War. The
Second was against the Lords that had
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:51505:43"/>
bin lately made by his Majesty, that
they should have no Seat or Vote in
Parliament, and that his Majesty nor
his Successors should make none for
the future without consent of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
which was to take away the
most unquestion'd flower of his Crown,
his being the sole fountain of Honor.
The third was a Bill of exceptions from
pardon, that included almost all of his
Majesty's Subjects that had any conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Estates. The fourth was an Act
for the Militia, which embraced ten
times more power, than the Crown
ever executed, for the two Houses, rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
men and money arbitrarily; which
was no more nor less than dethro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of the King, and enslaving the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
by a Law, and in effect to give the
King only the leave to discourse whose
the Glass Windows should be. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless
the Title and Frontispiece of
this vast Design was so modest, that
many well-wishing persons were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
to believe, that by all means
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:51505:43"/>
his Majesty ought to pass those Bills
for many reasons; but especially because
his Enemies would deliver his Majesty
to the World as obstinate to his own
and the Kingdoms ruin if he should
not accept this offer. To avoid both
the inconveniencies of granting or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusing,
I drew an Answer of the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
before it began; that if they would
needs think it expedient to require so
great Hostages from his Majesty, they
would not be backward to give some
token to his Majesty of their reality,
and then desired that at the same time
his Majesty should pass these four Bills,
the Houses would pass four of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty's
drawing, which were all most
popular, and such as they durst not
pass nor well deny: at least if they
did, they could with no colour of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
accuse his Majesty for not grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
what was most unjust and most un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>popular.
The first was a Bill for pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Army, which contained
their disbanding as soon as they were
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:51505:44"/>
paid. The second, a period to the present
Parliament. The third, for restoring
the King, Queen, and Royal Family
to their Revenues. The fourth, the
settling of the Church-Government
without any coercive Power; and in
the mean time, till such a Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
were agreed on, the old to stand,
without coercive Authority. I shew'd
this Answer first to <hi>Mr. Leg,</hi> then to
Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> and Dr. <hi>Sheldon,</hi> who
seemed to approve of the Expedient,
and desir'd <hi>Mr. Ashburnham</hi> would ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint
the King with it. But I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
heard any thing from his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty;
and I was resolved never to
have it obtruded, lest I should appear
fond of my own Conceptions. By his
Majesty's directions an Answer was
drawn, that gave a full Denial, which
was, in my judgment, very well pen'd.
But I thought good penning did not
signify much at that time, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
made this Objection: It is very
possible, that upon his Majesty's giving
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:51505:44"/>
an absolute Negative, the Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners
may have Orders to enjoin the
Governor to look more strictly to
his Person, and so his intended Escape
would be prevented. His Majesty
replied immediately, That he had
thought of a Remedy, which was,
to deliver his Answer seal'd to the
Commissioners; and so left us. I
could not hold from letting <hi>Mr. Ash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burnham</hi>
find my sense of this sorry
Expedient, by saying, that the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners
would either open the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,
or conclude that in effect it was
a Denial, and proceed accordingly:
but all was in vain. Some few days
after, the <hi>English</hi> Commissioners arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
and delivered their Message, and
desired an Answer within three or
four days. The next day the Lords
<hi>Lowdon, Lanerick, Lauderdale, Chiesly,</hi>
and others, Commissioners for the
Kingdom of <hi>Scotland,</hi> deliver'd a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testation
to the King, subscribed by
them, against the Message, as not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:51505:45"/>
with their Covenant. From
that time they began to treat seriously
with his Majesty, but would not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
that either <hi>Mr. Ashburnham</hi> or I should
assist at the Treaty, for which I for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give
them with all my heart; for it
would have bin very insecure for us to
have had any communication with
them at that time. At last they came
to such a conclusion as they could get,
not such a one as they desired from the
King, but much short of it, which
gave an advantage to the Lord <hi>Argyle</hi>
and the Clergy-Party in <hi>Scotland</hi> to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
it as not satisfactory, and by that
means retarded the proceeding of
Duke <hi>Hamilton</hi> and that Army four
Months, which was consequently
the ruin of <hi>Laughern</hi> in <hi>VVales,</hi> and of
the Forces in <hi>Kent</hi> and <hi>Essex,</hi> and of
the <hi>Scots</hi> Army also, which consist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of twenty four thousand men, all
which Forces were the result of the
Treaty; which appears to me, if it
had been sooner dispatch'd, to have bin
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:51505:45"/>
one of the most prudent Acts of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty's
Reign, however unprosperous.
When the time was come that the
King was to deliver his Answer, his
Majesty sent for the English Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioners,
and before he delivered his
Answer, ask'd my Lord <hi>Denbigh</hi> (who
was the chief Commissioner) whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they had power to alter any
substantial or circumstantial part of
their Message; and when they repli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
they had not, his Majesty deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd
his answer to the Lord <hi>Denbigh</hi>
sealed. After they had withdrawn
a while, my Lord <hi>Denbigh</hi> return'd
with the rest, and seem'd offended
with his Majesty for delivering the
Message setled, and express'd his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation
in harsher terms than one
Gentleman ought to use to another.
After long expostulations, his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
was perswaded to open his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,
which was so far from allaying
the Storm, as it increased it both in
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:51505:46"/>
the Commissioners and the Governor,
who altogether retired from the Castle
of <hi>Carisbroke</hi> to <hi>Newport,</hi> an English
mile from the Castle. As soon as they
were gone, I went to <hi>Mr. Ashburnham,</hi>
who told me he had newly dispatch'd
away a Footman over the Water, to
order four or five Horses to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved
from the Place where they
then stood, lest they should be found
and seiz'd by the Soldiers that were
coming into the Island. I conjured
him by no means to do it, lest the
Winds or the Parliament's Frigats
might force us in our escape to put
ashore, and we should want Horses.
He thereupon sent a Groom after him,
and brought him back, but within
few hours after sent him again with
the first Order, but upon what ground
I know not, unless that of good hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandry.
That night or the next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his Majesty resolved to endeavour
his Escape, but he met with two great
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:51505:46"/>
Obstacles: the Wind in the very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
became cross, and the Governor
return'd from <hi>Newport</hi> full of fury,
and lock'd up the Gates, and doubled
his Guards, and went not to bed that
night. In the morning he command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
all his Majesty's Servants from him.
Before we took our leaves, we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
his Majesty, that we had
left the Captain of the Frigat, and two
honest and trusty Gentlemen of
the Island, to assist his Escape, and that
we would have all things in readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
on the other side of the Water.
His Majesty commanded us to draw
a Declaration in his name that night,
and send it to his Majesty in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.
When we came to <hi>Newport,
VVill. Leg</hi> and I left <hi>Mr. Ashburnham</hi>
and the rest in the Inn, and went to
an Acquaintance's house of ours in
the Town, where, after we had staid
an hour, we heard a Drum beat con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusedly,
and not long after that, one
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:51505:47"/>
Captain <hi>Burley,</hi> with divers others,
were risen to rescue the King. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this Mr. <hi>Leg</hi> and I went to the Inn,
where we found Mr. <hi>Ashburnham</hi> mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Speeches to those poor well-affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
People, advising them to desist
from their vain Enterprize. I must
confess I thought any communication
of ours with them dangerous, and
therefore I advised Mr. <hi>Ashburnham</hi> not
to say any thing to them; for when
his words were out of his mouth, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
would interpret them, and say
he said what they pleased: and it was
well for him and us that we did so;
for the Prisoners were not only exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd
concerning us, but promis'd
Liberty and Pardon in case they would
peach us; and the Governor of the
<hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ows</hi> had order from <hi>Hammond</hi> to put us
a Ship-board, and to carry us to <hi>London</hi>
upon suspicion that we were accessory
to this Rising; which was a Design so
impossible for those that undertook it
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:51505:47"/>
to effect, consisting of Women and
Children without any Arms saving one
Musket, that no sober man could
possibly have been engaged in it. I
was desired that night to draw the
Declaration for his Majesty, which I
did, and it was approved of by all but
<hi>Mr. Ashburnham,</hi> and at last publish'd in
his Majesty's name. After we had staid
on the other side of the Water about
three weeks, expecting the Kings co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
over to us, and began at last
to despair of it, I moved to <hi>Mr.
Ashburnham, Mr. Leg</hi> and <hi>Mr. Denham</hi>
(who was then come to us from <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi>)
that some one might be sent to
the Queen from us all, which was
consented to, and I made choice of by
the rest.</p>
