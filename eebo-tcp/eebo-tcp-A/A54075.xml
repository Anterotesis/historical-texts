         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>MY Soul hath ſtil in remembrance the grievous ſhakings and rendings that have been in this Nation, which entred deep into the bowels of it, and made every heart ake, and every mind aſtoniſhed. This Nation was ſetled in religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and outward peace, in ſuch a way as was pleaſing to moſt: but yet there was a ſpirit within, which had been long groaning under oppreſſion, whoſe ſighs and cryes entred into the ears of the Lord; and he aroſe up in his fury and jealouſie, and rent the heavens, and rent the earth, ſo breaking the very foundations of both, that men generally were amazed, and wondred what would become of all. The former Religion was almoſt buried in confuſion, and in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of being utterly loſt: a long-ſpun corroding war were we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled in, which adminiſtred no hopes nor likelihood of peace. The hand of the Lord reacheth through all theſe dominions; Maſtracy, Miniſtry, the common people, the people of God (both ſuch as were accounted ſo, and ſuch as were indeed ſo) the line of confuſion was ſtretched over them all; they did all reel and tot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter like a drunken man, as if they had been ſo to fal, as to riſe up no more:</p>
            <p>But behold how ſuddainly and unexpectedly was there a ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of al again! The Nation ſetled in peace, Magiſtracy ſetled, Miniſtry ſetled, the common people ſetled; and thoſe which were ſhaken in their Spirits, got into their ſeveral waies in religion and ſetled again. Thus there was a general healing of all again ſave onely of a few, whoſe Spirits God had ſo reached, that their wound was incurable: and unleſs ſomewhat of God had been brought forth, which the world cannot know (nay the religions ſpirit of man which is below, can no more reach it, then the common ſpirit of the world) they had remained miſerable, loſt, ſcattered, and confounded to this day. But the Lord hath in infinitemercy viſited them, in the ſeaſon of diſtreſs; and there hath a little fooliſh thing broke forth (at which all the wiſe, and religious in the Spirit of this world cannot but ſtumble) which hath adminiſtred relief, and diſcovered the foundation whereupon they alſo can ſettle. So that
<pb facs="tcp:52304:2"/>
now there is as it were an univerſal ſettlement, as every creature is gathered into that center, which is proper and ſutable to its Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit to bottom on.</p>
            <p>Now this I have to ſay to all; Let every one look to his foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, for the Lord can ariſe again, yea and will ariſe again and ſhake once more; and then the heavens and the earth which have not a true foundation, cannot but fall. If the earth be not founded upon and ſettled in righteouſneſs, its preſent eſtabliſhment will not ſtand: if the heavens be not founded upon and ſetled in truth, they will melt and paſs away before the fire of the Lord. There is a ſpirit that mourneth deeply to the Lord, groaning in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly, and his ears are open to it, and he will plead the cauſe of his ſeed: and the Churches and religions, wherein the ſeed of the Serpent can live and flouriſh, ſhall wither and come to an end. Duſt is already become the Serpents food; the Spirt of man in all his exerciſes of religion, knoweth not the bread of life: but the dead feed upon the dead, and the dead ſpirit of man loves to have it ſo. But this cannot continue, for the Lord hath been at work all this while, and when he brings forth the people which he hath been forming, and their religion, the religion of man will appear what it is; and ſhame and ſorrow will be the portion of all who have pleaſed themſelves therein, and trifled away the day of their viſitation.</p>
            <p>Be wiſe now therefore, O ye wiſe ones; be religious, O religious ones! Open the eye and ear that hath been ſhut, ſhut the eye and ear that hath been open: Stumble no longer, leaſt ye fall and riſe no more. I know ye cannot ſee, for the wrong eye is open, and the Lord hath deſigned to hide his wiſdom from that eye. If it be poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for you, become poor in ſpirit, leaſt ye at laſt prove to be the rich, whom the Lord will ſend empty away. Sell all apace, that ye may have wherewith to buy the Pearl. Ye have not known the appearance of the Lord, but in your wiſdom have diſdained it, and he hath diſdained to make uſe of you in this great work; but it hath been pleaſant to him to lay ſtumbling blocks before you, that ye might fall and be broken. The children, the fools, the blind can ſee the way, and enter into life: but ye that are men, that are wiſe, that have both your eys, that can judge in religion, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine what is Orthodox and what erroneous, yet cannot.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:52304:2"/>
O hear, that your ſouls may live! Ye know not how ſhort your time is, the day of your viſitation paſſeth away faſter then ye are aware. The cry hath long gone forth, Behold the Bridegroom cometh, and his Spouſe hath been preparing for his bed. Ye muſt off with your old Garments, and have the new Garment on, ye muſt have the true oyl in your Lamps, or the door of the Kingdom will be ſhut upon you, and there will be no entrance for you. In plain terms, ye muſt part with all your Religion which ye have gathered in your own wiſdom, which hath grown up in the Apoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and which onely can make a fair ſhow in the dark, but cannot endure the ſearching light of the day of the Lord; and ye muſt purchaſe the true religion, the true righteouſneſs, the true inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency and purity of Chriſt: the old muſt be done away, truly done away, and the new come in the place; ſo that fleſh and ſelf may be quite deſtroyed, and nothing but Chriſt found in you, and you found no where but in Chriſt, if you enter into his Kingdom: for no unclean thing can enter. Therefore put away pride, and paſſion, and enmity, and fleſhly reaſonings; and ſeek out that which is pure, and enter into it, and take up the croſs againſt all that is contrary, that ſo you may be wrought into it, and found in it. And turn from all imaginings, and conceivings about the meanings of Scripture, in the uncertain and erring mind, and come to that which is infallible. And know the ſilencing of the fleſhly part, that the ſpiritual part may grow in the wiſdom, that ſo ye may learn in the ſpirit, and know the word of God, and be able to ſpeak it.</p>

The Lord had been kind to me in breaking of me in my religion, and in viſiting me with ſweet and precious light from his own ſpirit, but I knew it not. I felt, and could not but acknowledge a power up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me, and might have known what it was, by its purifying of my heart, and begetting me into the image of God: but I confind it to

So that I have no cauſe to boaſt over others, but to lie low in abaſement of ſpirit. And what I write, is not in any dominion or authority of my own, but to bring others unto that dominion and authority, which it is good for me, and for every one elſe to be ſubject to. The Lord ſtrip us of our own underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and of that righteouſneſs which is but ours (though we have called it his) that ſo we may be gathered into, and receive his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, and be cloathed with his righeouſneſs, and feel his reſt and peace. And happy is he that loſeth all to gain this; but he that keepeth what he hath too long, ſhall in the end loſe all, and yet not gain this neither.

               <p>That the Apoſtles, and Chriſtians in their days, had the true Spirit, the true Light, the true Life, I think will not be denyed. <hi>We know that we are of God, and that the Son of God is come, and hath given us an underſtanding that we may know him that is true: and we are in him that is true, in his Son Jeſus Chriſt. This is the true God and eternall life,</hi> 1 Joh. 5. 19. 20. They wer truly born of God, and knew the Son of God come, receiving from him a true underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and the true light and knowledge in that underſtanding, and both the underſtanding and knowledge was rooted and ſeated in him that is true, wher their ſcituation &amp; abiding was <hi>(we are in him that is true)</hi> wher they met with the true Spirit, the true God, the true Life, even life eternal. That they had the true ſpirit from God, <hi>(becauſe ye are Sons, God hath ſent forth the ſpirit of his Son into your hearts,</hi> Gal. 4. 6.) that they had the true light from God <hi>(God who commanded the light to ſhine out of darkneſſe, hath ſhined in our hearts, &amp;c.</hi> 2 Cor. 4. 6.) that they had the true life from and in the ſpirit <hi>(if we live in the ſpirit, let us alſo walk in the ſpirit,</hi> Gal. 5. 25.) is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally acknowledged concerning them.</p>
               <p>Now of an Apoſtacy from this, beginning even in their dayes, and to be compleated not long after, the Scriptures alſo make mention. The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks expreſly of the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:52304:5"/>
thing, that ther muſt come <hi>a falling away,</hi> and a revealing of <hi>the man of ſinne, the ſon of perdition,</hi> 2 Theſ. 2. 3. <hi>Chriſt</hi> the man of ſalvation had ſhewed and declared the path of life, had diſcovered the true Church, which was <hi>the pillar and ground of truth,</hi> againſt which the gates of he I could not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail; had ſent the true ſpirit, which could <hi>lead into all truth,</hi> and preſerve in the truth: but ther muſt ſpring up a <hi>man of ſinne, a ſon of perdition,</hi> who in a myſtery ſhould work againſt this, and cauſe a falling from this to another thing. And this the Apoſtle did not onely give a touch of here in writing, but he had likewiſe told them of theſe things by word of mouth, to which he refers them, <hi>verſ.</hi> 5. This wer enough to an ey opened; but for further illuſtration to the thick underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of man, which is ſurrounded with fogs and miſts of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, ſome more evidences from Scriptures may be given.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Chriſt</hi> foretold of falſe Prophets, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. 15. <hi>Beware of falſe Prophets, which come to you in ſheeps clothing, but inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they are ravening wolves.</hi> The Lord ſent true Prophets un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Law, and gave them true viſions to declare: Chriſt ſent true Apoſtles and Miniſters under the Goſpel, and gave them the truth which they ſhould preach and propagate. But then ther wer falſe Prophets, falſe Apoſtles and Miniſters to come after, who never wer ſent by Chriſt, nor never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the truth from his ſpirit. Now theſe do not come to gather into the life and truth of Chriſt, but to ſcatter from it; and ſo either to begin, or uphold an Apoſtacy. And, ſaith Chriſt, beware of them, for they come very ſubtilly, they come in the ſheeps clothing: They get the garment of the ſheep upon their backs, even that very garment which the ſheep did wear; but they have not the nature of the ſheep, but the nature of the wolfe, which is ravenous after the life of the ſheep. Mark wher ther is the Garment without, but not the nature within; wher ther is the form of God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe, but not the power; wher ther are Scripture-words and practiſes, but not the ſpirit of life from which they came, ther's the falſe Prophet, ther's the Wolf, ther's the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, ther's the Seducer from Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Aagin, <hi>Chriſt</hi> fore-tells of many falſe Prophets, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24.
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:52304:5"/>
11. <hi>And many falſe Prophets ſhal riſe, and ſhal deceive ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny:</hi> and verſ. 24. <hi>For ther ſhal ariſe falſe Chriſts, and falſe Prophets, and ſhall ſhew great ſigns and wonders: inſomuch that (if it were poſſible) they ſhal deceive the very Elect.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And as <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf, ſo his Apoſtles alſo after him, by the ſame ſpirit, foretel of the ſame thing.</p>
               <p>The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of ſeducing ſpirits in the latter times, and of Doctrines of Devils, which ſhould prevail to cauſe a departure in ſome from the faith, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 2. And if in thoſe days the power of Seducers was ſo great, as to draw from the truth, which was then ſo manifeſt and living, how eaſie would it be to keep from the truth afterward, when it had been long loſt and out of remembrance, and thereby de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit got into the place and name of it.</p>
               <p>The Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> alſo foretold of <hi>falſe Teachers,</hi> who ſhould <hi>privily bring in damnable hereſies, even denying the Lord that bought them:</hi> and that they ſhould ſo prevail, that their <hi>pernitious wayes</hi> ſhould be followed by many, and <hi>the way of truth evil ſpoken of,</hi> 2 Pet. 2. 1, 2.</p>
               <p>Again, <hi>Paul</hi> in his 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> Epiſt. to <hi>Tim.</hi> ſpeaks of the laſt days, that the times therin ſhould be <hi>perillous,</hi> Chap, 3. Chriſt had ſaid, <hi>The love of many ſhould wax cold, and iniquity abound,</hi> Mat. 24. 12. And <hi>Paul</hi> ſhowes how the times would prove very perillous by the abounding of iniquity. <hi>In the laſt dayes perillous times ſhall come; for men ſhall be lovers of their owne ſelves, covetous, boaſters, proud, blaſphemers, diſobedient to Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, unthankeful, unholy, without natural affection, truce-brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers, falſe accuſers, incontinent, fierce deſpiſers of thoſe that are good, traytors, heady, high-minded, lovers of pleaſure more then lovers of God,</hi> 2. Tim. 2. verſ. 1. 2, 3, 4. Behold what kind of fruit ſprung up from the falſe doctrine of the falſe Teachers in the Apoſtacy from the truth. And yet al this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a form of godlineſſe, <hi>Having a form of Godlineſſe, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying the power therof,</hi> verſ. 5. <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſent the power of God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe into the world, to ſubdue the root from whence al this ſprings, to kil the evil nature inwardly: but in the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goſtacy the evill nature is not killed, but the power denyed which ſhould kil it, and the form kept up to cover the evil
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:52304:6"/>
nature with. The inwardly ravening nature, which devours and deſtroyes the ſtirrings and ſhootings forth of the juſt one in the heart, that gets the ſheeps clothing, the form of God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe to cover it ſelfe with. Look any wher among the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtates from the Apoſtles ſpirit and doctrine, and ſee; Is ſelfe-love killed? is covetouſneſſe killed? is boaſting and pride killed? is the love of pleaſures killed? are Perſecutors and oppreſſors killed? and is your honour and glory laid in the duſt? Nay they are but covered with the form, there life is ſtil in them; the power wherewith they ſhould be killed was at firſt denyed, and now is loſt and not known, wher there is the life, ther is the power; and wher ther is the power, the evil nature is killed: but wher the evil nature is not killed, ther is onely a form of godlineſſe, a covering, a painted Sepulchre, but rottenneſſe within.</p>
               <p>Now thoſe laſt dayes and laſt times were not far off, but begun then: For the Apoſtle exhorts <hi>Timothy</hi> to turn away from ſuch, <hi>verſ.</hi> 5. <hi>From ſuch turn away;</hi> intimating that even then there wer ſuch to be turnedaway from. And he ſaith, <hi>verſ.</hi> 8. that they did then reſiſt the truth like <hi>Jannes and Jam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bres,</hi> who with a likeneſſe of what <hi>Moſes</hi> wrought, but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out life, did ſtrive to reſiſt the life and power that was in <hi>Moſes.</hi> (And this is the work of all deceivers, to get their own ſpirit into the likeneſs, and then to make uſe of the like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to oppoſe and ſuppreſſe the true life and power.) So that they were come even then, when the Apoſtle wrote this Epiſtle to <hi>Timothy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And <hi>Jude</hi> ſaith, that <hi>ungodly men, turning the grace of God into laſciviouſneſſe, and denying the onely Lord God, and our Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> were <hi>crept in</hi> already, <hi>verſ.</hi> 4. of his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle.</p>
               <p>And the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> ſpeaks very expreſly, 1. <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. 18, 19. <hi>Little Children, it is the laſt time, and as ye have heard that Antichriſt ſhal come, even now are ther many Antichiſts, wherby we know that it is the laſt time., They went out from us, &amp;c. Chriſt</hi> inſtructing his Diſciples concerning the laſt times, tells them ther ſhall ariſe falſe Chriſts, with great power of deceit, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. <hi>v.</hi> 24. Now ſaith <hi>John</hi> here, ther are come
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:52304:6"/>
                  <hi>many Antichriſts, wherby we know it is the laſt time,</hi> Mark, Ther wer many Antichriſts to begin and lay the foundation of the apoſtacy, and make way for the great <hi>Antichriſt</hi> (who was to be their ſucceſſor in the apoſtacy., and not the ſucceſſor of the Apoſtles in the truth:) And theſe did not. a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide in the doctrine of the Apoſtles, who preached <hi>the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Goſpel,</hi> nor in the ſpirit and principle which they were in; but <hi>went out</hi> from them, from theit ſpirit (from the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointing to which they kept, and by which they were kept) into another ſpirit, and preached another Goſpel; a Goſpel which was not the power of God to kil the earthly, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted in ſuch a dead literal knowledge of things, as the earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly might be fed and kept alive by. And as the great <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt</hi> was to come, ſo there Antichriſts who were to make way for him, were already come, and were already laying the foundation of, and beginning the apoſtacy. So that the Spirit of Antichriſt (that very ſpirit wherein Antichriſt ſucceeded, and in which he grew up, and perfected the apoſtacy) was then in the world, as this Apoſtle ſaith yet more manifeſtly, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. 3. <hi>This is that ſpirit of Antichriſt, wherof ye have heard that it ſhould come, ànd even now already is it in the world.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nor was it idle, but it was at work, working it ſelfe into the form of godlineſſe, that it might eat out the power, drive out the true ſpirit, and make a prey of the life. <hi>The myſtery of iniquity,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle <hi>Paul, doth already work,</hi> 2 Theſ. 2. 7. This ſpirit did work in a myſtery of iniquity to eat out the myſtery of godlineſſe, and to ſet up this myſtery of iniquity in the world inſtead of the myſtery of godlineſs. And it did pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail to wind it ſelf into the form, &amp; get poſſeſſion of the form, and alſo to trample upon &amp; keep under the life. It gained the <hi>outward Court,</hi> (for when that ſpirit had corrupted it, the Lord did not regard it, but gave it up to it) and it trod down the <hi>holy City,</hi> Rev. 11. 2. And this myſtery of iniquity did not begin to work many ages after the Apoſtles, but even then, in their dayes, <hi>already: The myſtery of iniquity doth already work.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And look now into the eſtate of the Churches then, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to what the <hi>Scripture</hi> records of them, and the ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptoms of its working will plainly appear. The Church of
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:52304:7"/>
                  <hi>Epheſus</hi> (among whom ſome of the grievous wolves had encred, <hi>Act.</hi> 20. 29.) had left their firſt love, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 4. The Churches of <hi>Galatia</hi> wer bewitched from the Goſpel, <hi>Gal,</hi> 3. 1. The Church at <hi>Coloſs</hi> was entangled and made ſubject to the rudiments of the world, and ordinances (which periſh with the uſing) after the commandements and doctrines of men, <hi>Col</hi> 2. <hi>v.</hi> 20, 22. (Mark. When once one comes to be ſubject to the commandments and doctrines of men, to pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing ordinances and worldly rudiments which men teach and command, the true ſtate is loſt, and the apoſtacy is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into. Here the wrong Teacher is teaching, and he teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the wrong thing, the wrong doctrines, the wrong Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments; and the wrong ear is hearing, which hears the wrong voice, and knoweth not the true: and ſo the more it heareth and practiſeth, and the hotter its zeal groweth, the deeper it ſtil runs into the apoſtacy.) The Church at <hi>Corinth</hi> alſo was haunted with falſe Apoſtles, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. <hi>v.</hi> 12, 13. in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch as the Apoſtle was afraid leſt that Church ſhould be corrupted by them, <hi>verſ.</hi> 3. The Church in <hi>Pergamus</hi> had them that held the doctrine of <hi>Balaam, Rev.</hi> 2. 14. The Church in <hi>Thyatira</hi> ſuffered the woman <hi>Jezebel,</hi> which cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led her ſelfe a Propheteſs, to ſeduce and bring forth children in the apoſtacy, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. <hi>v.</hi> 20. and 23. The Church in <hi>Sardis</hi> had a name to live, but was dead, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 1. having defiled her Garments, <hi>verſ.</hi> 4. The Church in <hi>Laodicea,</hi> looked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on her ſelf as rich, and increaſed with goods, &amp; as having need of nothing: but was wretched, miſerable, poor, blind, (ſo then the ey was put out) and naked, wanting the gold, wanting the rayment, wanting the eye-ſalve, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 17. 18. And laſtly all the <hi>Gentiles</hi> were warned by <hi>Paul,</hi> in his Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle to the Church at <hi>Rome,</hi> (whereby that Church might look upon her ſelfe as more particularly concerned therein) to look to their ſtanding, leſt they falling from the faith, from the truth, from the life into the apoſtacy (as the <hi>Jewes</hi> had done) might alſo feel the ſeverity of God, as the <hi>Jewes</hi> had, Chap. 11. <hi>ver.</hi> 20, 21, 22.</p>
               <p>Thus it is evident that the apoſtacy had got footing, and began to ſpread in the Apoſtles dayes: and the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi>
                  <pb n="7" facs="tcp:52304:7"/>
in the ſpirit beholding the future ſtate of things, ſees it o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſpread and over-run al, <hi>al Nations drunk with the cup of fornication,</hi> Rev. 18. 3. The way of truth had been evil ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of long before, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 2, and the rock of ages, which alone can eſtabliſh in the truth, had been forſaken, and al be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came as a <hi>Sea,</hi> and up gets the <hi>beaſt</hi> (which could not riſe while the power of truth ſtood) and the <hi>woman</hi> upon the beaſt, with the cup of deceit, and of errour from the life, in her hand; and this ſhe gives all the Nations to drink, and they drink and are drunk with it, ſo that al Nations have been intoxica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the doctrines and practiſes of apoſtacy. They have took that for truth, which the Whore told them was truth, and they have obſerved thoſe things as the commands of God, which the Whore told them were the commands of God. And by this means they have never come to be married to Chriſt, to be in union with him, to receive the law of life from his ſpirit, and to know the liberty from the bondage of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, but have been in the bed of fornication with the Whore, and have pleaſed, glutted, and ſatisfied the whoriſh principle in themſelves with this fornication. And thus cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption did over-ſpread al the earth: for taking in a corrupt thing in ſtead of the truth, it cannot purifie the heart, but cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt it more. A corrupt profeſſion, corrupt doctrines may paint, and make a man to himſelfe ſeem changed, but the corruption ſtill lodges within, which a ſpiritual ey can eaſily diſcern, though he that is in the corruption cannot. The <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees</hi> did ſeem glorious to themſelves, but <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſaw through them. And every ſort of people now, in their ſeveral ſtrains and forms of apoſtacy, ſeem glorious to themſelves, but the ſpirit of Chriſt ſees through them al, to that which lies under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath (in whom it raigns) and ther it finds corruption in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed and ſtrengthned in its nature by the form; though outwardly painted with it. Doth not fornication defile, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt? ſo doth the fornication of the Whoriſh ſpirit: <hi>the earth was corrupted with it,</hi> Rev. 19. 2. So that this hath been the univerſal ſtate of Chriſtendom ſince the apoſtacy, the errour, the deceit, the fornication of the Whore hath corrupted them, and withheld their eys from the ſight of that life and truth
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:52304:8"/>
which hath power in it to purifie them. <hi>Peoples, Multitudes, Nations, Tongues,</hi> have been al waters; weak, unſtable, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any foundation in religion, but fit to be ſwayed and toſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed up and down with every wind or breath of the Whore, of whoſe cup they had al drunk, and by whoſe ſpirit they were all guided: for <hi>the whore ſate upon them,</hi> Rev. 17. 15. The whore, which had whored from God, and ſo was not the true Church, <hi>ſate upon Peoples, Multitudes, Nations and Tongues.</hi> She ſate upon them, ſhe had them under her, ſhe ruled and gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded them by her cup of fornication, and with her ſpirit of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication, as a man would guide the beaſt whereupon he rides. So that al that the Nations do from henceforth, in religion is under the Whore, according to her guidance, by virtue of the wine that they have drunk out of her cup.</p>
               <p>And though God reſerved to himſelfe a remnant to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip him, and give ſo ne teſtimony to his truth al this time, yet the <hi>beaſt</hi> (which was managed by the <hi>Whore)</hi> had power over them: power to make war with them, power to overcome them, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13. 7. The <hi>beaſt</hi> had power over all <hi>kindreds, tongues and nations,</hi> every wher to overcome the <hi>Saints,</hi> and ſuppreſſe the truth they at any time were moved to give teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony to, and to ſet up the worſhip of the <hi>beaſt,</hi> and make al the earth fal down before that, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13. 7. 8. And the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond <hi>beaſt</hi> had and exerciſed al the power of the firſt <hi>beaſt,</hi> and ſet up his image, and gave it life, and cauſed men gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally to worſhip it, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13. 12. <hi>And he cauſed al both ſmal and great, rich and poor, free and bond to receive his mark,</hi> ſome way or other, either in their right hand or in their forehead, <hi>verſ.</hi> 16. And ſuch as would not receive his mark, nor worſhip him, he had power to perſecute and kil, and he did kil them, <hi>verſ.</hi> 15. and the Whore drunk their blood, Chap. 17. 6. and God required it at her hand, Chap. 19. 2. though ſhe made the hand of the beaſt execute it, and would ſeem to waſh her own hands of it.</p>
               <p>So that now ſince the dayes of the Apoſtles, even al this time of the Apoſtacy, ſince the man child hath been caught up to God, and was not to be found in the earth (which makes it ſeem ſuch a ſtrange thing for people to ſay Chriſt
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:52304:8"/>
is in them) and the woman hath been in the wilderneſs, and not in the habitable part of the world, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12. 5. 6. if al this time, any one wil look for the true religon, for the true Church, for the true knowledg and worſhip of God, he muſt not look on any Nation, or any People, or among the Tongues, which are cried up in Nations and people, for the original, and as the chief interpreters of the original; for they are al drunk with the whores cup; they are under the power, dominion, authority and ſervice of the <hi>whore,</hi> who rides upon the <hi>beaſt,</hi> to whom <hi>power was given over al kindreds, tongues and nations.</hi> But look among the Nations who was perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, whoſe blood was drunk, whom the powers of the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons made war againſt, ther alone the teſtimony of Jeſus is to be found, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12. 17. ther alone are the witneſſes againſt the preſent idolatry and corruption, and to ſome truths or other of Chriſts which God enlightned them with, and wherto he, ſtirred them up to give their teſtimony, though with the loſs of their eſtates, liberties or lives.</p>
               <p>Now by what hath been expreſſed, is it not manifeſt to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very ey, that hath room but to let in the letter of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, in ſimplicity and plainneſs, that there hath been a great apoſtacy from the true knowledge of Chriſt, and an univerſal corruption &amp; power of death ſprung up, inſtead of the power of his life and grace? <hi>The grace of God which bringeth ſalvation,</hi> hath diſappeared; and <hi>the abomination of deſolation</hi> hath took up its place, and filled it with deadly venome againſt the truth and againſt the life, ſo that enmity againſt God, under a pretenſe of love and zeal to him, hath reigned generally in the hearts of men, from the times of the Apoſtles to this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent day. And as the light breaks forth, and their eys come to be opened, they wil ſee that they have been and are ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of God, and of his life and ſpirit, but lovers of the world, and of ſuch a religion as ſuits the worldly Spirit.</p>

               <p>Now it may be inſtanced in every particular, how the ſtate of Chriſtianity was loſt, but that would be too vaſt and tedious: it may ſuffice therfore to inſtance in ſome conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles ones, which may lead into the diſcovery of the reſt.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>The true rule of Chriſtianity, or the rule of a Chriſtian, which is to direct, guid and order him in his whole courſe, was apoſtatized from and loſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What is a Chriſtians rule, whereby he is to ſteer and order his courſe?</p>
               <p>A Chriſtian is to be a follower of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and conſequently muſt have the ſame rule to walk by, as <hi>Chriſt</hi> had. A Chriſtian proceeds from <hi>Chriſt,</hi> hath the ſame life in him, and needs the ſame rule. <hi>Chriſt</hi> had the fulneſſe of life, and of his fulneſſe we al receive a meaſure of the ſame life. <hi>We are members of his body, of his fleſh, and of his bones,</hi> Epheſ. 5. 30. yea we came out of the ſame ſpring of life, from whence he came: <hi>for both he that ſanctifieth, and they who are ſanctified, are al of one: for which cauſe he is not aſhamed to cal them brethren,</hi> Ebr. 2. 11. Now what was his rule? was it not the fulneſs of life which he received? And what is their rule? is it not the meaſure of life which they receive? Was not Chriſts rule the law of the ſpirit, the law which the ſpirit wrote in his heart? And is not their rule the law of the ſpirit, the law which the ſpirit writes in their hearts? How was Chriſt made a King and a Prieſt? was it by the law of a carnal commandment? or by the power of an endles life? And how are they made Kings and Prieſts to God? <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. 6. Is it by the law of a car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal commandment? or is it by the power of the ſame endles life?

                  <hi>Lo I come to do thy will, O God,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>when he cometh into the world,</hi> Ebr. 10. ver. 5. &amp; 7. but by what rule? by what law? <hi>thy law is within my heart,</hi> Pſal. 40. 8. And the ſame ſpirit who wrote it ther, is alſo to write the new Covenant with al the laws of it, in the heart of every Chriſtian from the leaſt to the greateſt, <hi>Ebr.</hi> 8. 9. 10. yea the ſame ſpirit that dwelt in Chriſts heart, is to dwel in their hearts, according to the promiſe of the Covenant, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36. 27. This was <hi>Pauls</hi> rule, after which he walked, <hi>the law of the ſpirit of life in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> Rom. 8. 1, 2. This made him <hi>free from the law of ſinne and death.</hi> Wher is the law of ſin writ? wher is the law of death writ? is it not writ in the heart? And muſt not the law of righteouſneſs and life be writ ther alſo, if it be able to deal with ſin and death? The ſpirit forms the heart anew, forms Chriſt in the heart, begets a new creature ther, which cannot ſin <hi>(He that is born of God ſins not)</hi> and this is the rule unto righteouſnes, the new creature, or the ſpirit of life in the new creature, <hi>Gal</hi> 6. 15. 16. <hi>In Chriſt Jeſus neither cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion availeth any thing nor uncircumciſion, but a new crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. And as many as walk according to this rule, peace be on them.</hi> Mark, ther's the rule, the new creature which is begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in every one that's born of God. <hi>If any man be in Chriſt, he is a new creature;</hi> and this new creature is to be his rule. And as any man walks according to this rule, according to the new creature, according to the law of light and life that the ſpirit continually breathes into the new creature, he hath peace: but as he tranſgreſſes that, and walks not after the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, but after the fleſh, he walks out of the light, out of the life, out of the peace, into the ſea, into the death, into the trouble, into the condemnation. Here then is the law of the converted man, the new creature; and the law of the new creature is the ſpirit of life which begat him, which lives and breathes &amp; gives forth his law continually in him. Here's a Chri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtian, here's his rule: He that hath not the new creature form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in him, is no Chriſtian: and he that hath the new creature, hath the rule in himſelfe. <hi>Ye have an unction from the holy one, and ye know al things,</hi> 1 Joh. 2. 20. How came they to know al things? doth not <hi>John</hi> ſay, it was by the <hi>unction?</hi> the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointing
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:52304:10"/>
was in them, a foundation or wel-ſpring of light and life, iſſuing forth continually ſuch Rivers and ſtreams of life within, as they needed no other Teacher in the truth and way of life, <hi>ver.</hi> 27. The <hi>Comforter</hi> did refreſh their hearts ſufficiently, and lead them into all truth. Search the Apoſtles Epiſtles, and ye ſhall find them teſtifying of the Lords ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his ſpirit into the hearts of Chriſtians, and exhortations to them not to grieve or quench the ſpirit, but to follow as they were lead. They were to <hi>live in the ſpirit,</hi> and to <hi>walke in the ſpirit,</hi> Gal. 5. 25. and the ſpirit was to walk, and live, and bring forth his own life and power in them, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 16. And what can be the proper and full rule of Gods Sons and Daughters, but the light of the ſpirit of life, which they receive from their father? Thus God did advance the ſtate of a believer, above the ſtate of the <hi>Jews</hi> under the law: for they had the law, though written with the ſinger of God, yet but in tables of ſtone; but theſe have the law, writ by the finger of God in the tables of their hearts. Their's was a law without, at a diſtance from them, and the Prieſts lips were to preſerve the knowledg of it, and to inſtruct them in it: but here is a law within, nigh at hand, the immediate light of the ſpirit of life ſhining ſo immediatly in the heart, that they need no man to teach them, but have the ſpirit of propheſy in themſelves, and quick living teachings from him continually, and are made ſuch Kings and Prieſts to God, as the ſtate of the law did but repreſent. The Goſpel is the ſubſtance of al the ſhadowes contained in the law; A Chriſtian is he that comes into this ſubſtance, and lives in this ſubſtance, and in whom this ſubſtance lives, and his rule is the ſubſtance it ſelf, in which he lives, &amp; which lives in him. Chriſt is the ſubſtance who lives in the Chriſtian, and he in Crhiſt: Chriſt lives in him by his ſpirit, and he in Chriſt by the ſame ſpirit: ther he lives, and hath fellowſhip with the Father and the Son, in the light wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they live, and not by any outward rule, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 6. 7.</p>
               <p>But what is the rule now in the Apoſtacy?</p>
               <p>Among the <hi>Papiſts</hi> the rule is the Scripture, interpreted by the Church (as they cal themſelves) with a mixture of their own precepts and traditions.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="13" facs="tcp:52304:10"/>
Among the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> the rule is the Scriptures, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as they can underſtand them by their own ſtudy, or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as they can receive the underſtanding of them from ſuch men as they account Orthodox. And hence ariſe conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual differences, and heaps, and ſects, one following this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation, another that.</p>
               <p>An this is a grievous apoſtacy, and the root, ſpring and foundation of al the reſt: for he that miſſeth in his begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, he that begins his Religion without the true rule, how can he proceed aright in any thing afterwards?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But are not the Scriptures the word of God? and is not the word of God to be a Chriſtians rule? If every one ſhould be left to his own ſpirit, what confuſion and uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty would this produce?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> The Scriptures are not that living word, which is appointed by God to be the rule of a Chriſtian; but they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain words, ſpoken by the ſpirit of God, teſtifying of that word, and pointing to that word which is to be the rule. <hi>Search the Scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life, and they are they which teſtifie of me: and ye will not come to me that ye might have life,</hi> Joh. 5. 39. 40. The Scriptures are to be ſearched, for the teſtimony which they give of Chriſt; and when that teſtimony is received, <hi>Chriſt</hi> is to be come to, and life received from him. But the <hi>Phariſees</hi> formerly, and <hi>Chriſtians</hi> ſince (I mean Chriſtians in name) ſearch the Scriptures, but do not come to <hi>Chriſt</hi> for the life; but ſtick in the letter of the Scriptures, and oppoſe the life with the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, keeping themſelves from the life by their wiſdome and knowledg in the letter. Thus they put the Scriptures into the place of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> &amp; ſo honor neither <hi>Chriſt</hi> nor the Scriptures. I had been no honour to <hi>John</hi> to have been taken for the light, his honour was to point to it: nor is it any honour to the Scriptures to be called the word of God, but their ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour is to diſcover and teſtifie of the word. Now hear what the Scriptures cal the word: <hi>In the beginning was the Word, and the word was with God, and the word was God,</hi> Jho. 1. 1. <hi>and the word was made fleſh,</hi> verſ. 14. This was the name of Chriſt, when he came into the world in the fleſh, to ſow his life in
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:52304:11"/>
the world. And when he comes again into the world, out of a far Country, to fight with the beaſt and falſe Prophets, and to clenſe the earth of the Whores fornication and idols, wherewith ſhe had corrupted it, he ſhal have the ſame name again <hi>his name is called, The word of God,</hi> Rev. 19. 13. So <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> calleth that the word of God, which liveth and abideth for ever, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 23. And this word that liveth and abideth for ever, was the word that they preached, <hi>ver.</hi> 25. And they that believed, did not cry up the words that the Apoſtles ſpake, for the word; but received the thing they ſpake of, <hi>the ingrafted word, which</hi> being received with a meek, quiet, and ſubmiſſive ſpirit, <hi>is able to ſave the ſoul,</hi> Jam. 1. 21. This is <hi>the word of faith</hi> that is <hi>nigh,, in the heart and in the mouth,</hi> Rom. 10. 8. This is the word that ſtands at the door of the heart, and ſpeaks to be let in <hi>(Behold I ſtand at the door and knock:)</hi> and when it is let in, it ſpeaks in the heart, what is to be heard and done. It is nigh, it is in the heart and in the mouth, to what end? <hi>that thou mighteſt hear it, and do it.</hi> The living word, which is <hi>quick and powerful, and ſharper then any two edged ſword,</hi> divides in the mouth, and divides in the heart the vile from the precious, yea it reacheth to the very inmoſt of the heart, and cuts between the roots, <hi>Ebr.</hi> 4. 11. and this thou art to hear and do. Thou art to part with al the vile words, the vile converſation, the vile courſe and worſhip of the world outwardly, and the vile thoughts and courſe of ſin inwardly, as faſt as the word diſcovers them to thee, and to exerciſe thy ſelfe in that which is folly and madneſſe to the ey of the world, and a grievous croſs to thine own worldly na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; yea when the word reaches to the very nature, life, and ſpirit within, from whence al that comes; that ſtrong wiſe root of the fleſhly life in the heart, muſt not he ſpared, nor that fooliſh weak thing (to mans wiſe ey) which is brought in ſtead thereof, be rejected: which when it it received, is but like a little ſeed, even the leaſt of all ſeeds; and when it growes up, it is a long while but like a child: and yet keeping in that childiſhneſs, out of the wiſdom, it enters into that Kingdom, which the greateſt wiſdom of man (in al his zealous waies and forms of religion) fels ſhort, and is ſhut out of. This is the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:52304:11"/>
word of life, this is the true living rule, and way to eternal life; and this is the obedience, this is the hearing and doing of the word. <hi>He that hath an ear, let him hear. Examine your ſelves whether ye be in the faith: prove your own ſelves. Know ye not your own ſelves, how that Jeſus Chriſt is in you, except ye be reprobates?</hi> 2 Cor. 13. 5. Are ye in the faith? then Chriſt is in you. Is not Chriſt in you? then ye are in the reprobate ſtate, out of the faith. Is Chriſt in you, and ſhal he not hold the reins, and rule? ſhal the living word be in the heart, and not the rule of the heart? ſhal he ſpeak in the heart, and the man or woman in whom he ſpeaks, run to words of Scripture formerly ſpoken, to know whether theſe be his words or no? Nay, nay, his ſheep know his voice better then ſo. Did the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle <hi>John,</hi> who had ſeen, and taſted, and handled, and prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched the word of life, ſend Chriſtians to his Epiſtles, or any other part of Scriptures, to be their rule? Nay, he directed them to the anointing, as a ſufficient Teacher, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. 17. <hi>He that believeth on me, as the ſcriptuce hath ſaid, out of his belly ſhal flow rivers of living water,</hi> Joh. 7. 38. He that hath the fountain of life in him, iſſuing up rivers of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving water continually, hath he need to go forth to fetch in water? <hi>The Kingdom of heaven is within you,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, and he bids <hi>ſeek the kingdom.</hi> Light the candle, ſweep thine own houſe, ſeek diligently for the kingdom; there it is, if thou canſt find it. Now he that hath found the kingdom within, ſhal he look without, into words ſpoken concerning the kingdom, to find the lawes of the kingdom? Are not the lawes of the kingdom to be found within the kingdom. Shal the kingdom be in the heart, and the laws of the kingdom writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten without, in a book? Is not the Goſpel the miniſtration of the ſpirit? and ſhal he who hath received the ſpirit, run back to the letter to be his guid? ſhal the living ſpirit, that gave forth Scriptures, be preſent, and not have preheminence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove his own words? What is the proper intent of the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter? is it not to teſtifie of the ſpirit, and to end in the ſpirit; The <hi>Law,</hi> the <hi>Prophets, John</hi> led to <hi>Chriſt in the fleſh,</hi> and he was to be the increaſing light, when they ſhould decreaſe. Chriſt words in the fleſh, the Apoſtles words afterwards, and
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:52304:12"/>
al words ſince are but to lead to Chriſt in the ſpirit, to the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal living ſubſtance; and then the words of Chriſt, of the Apoſtles, or any words ſpoken from the ſame ſpirit in theſe dayes, have brought to the ſpirit, to the feeling and ſetling of the ſoul in the living foundation, and to the building and perfecting of the man of God therein, they have attained their end and glory. But to cry up theſe, not underſtanding their voice, but keeping at a diſtance from the thing that they invite to; the words hereby are put out oftheir place, out of their proper uſe and ſervice, and ſo attain neither their end nor their glory. And though men put that upon them which ſeems to be a greater glory, namely to make them his rule and guid, yet it being not a true glory, it is no glory, but a diſhonour both to them, and to the ſpirit who gave them to another end.</p>
               <p>Now for the other part of the Objection, that if men ſhould be leſt to their own ſpirits, and ſhould follow the gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of their own ſpirits, it would produce confuſion and uncertainty: I do acknowledge it, it would do ſo. But here is no leaving of a man to his own ſpirit, ſpoken of or intended, but the directing and guiding of a man to the word and ſpirit of life; to know and hear the voice of Chriſt which gathers and tranſlates man out of his own ſpirit into his ſpirit: and here is no confuſion or uncertainty, but order, certainty and ſtability.</p>
               <p>The light of Gods ſpirit is a certain and infallible rule, (and the ey that ſees that, is a certain ey) whereas mans un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of the Scriptures is uncertain and fallible; he having not the true ear, receiveth ſuch a literal uncertain knowledg of things, into his uncertain underſtanding, as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives his ſoul. And here man in the midſt of his wiſdom and knowledg of the Scriptures, is loſt in his own erring and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain mind, and his ſoul deceived, for want of a true root and foundation of certainty in himſelf. But he that is come to the true ſhepherd, and knows his voice, he cannot be decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. Yea he can read the Scriptures ſafely, and taſte the true ſweetneſſe of them: for he being in the life, can taſte the ſweetneſſe of the words that came from the life; but
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:52304:12"/>
man who is out of the life, feeds on the husks, and can receive no more. He hath gathered a dead, dry, literal, husky know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg out of the Scripture, and that he can reliſh: but ſhould the life of the words, and things there ſpoken of be opened to him, he could not receive them, he himſelf being out of that wherewith they were wrote, and wherein alone they can be underſtood. But poor man having loſt the life, what ſhould he do? he can do no other, but cry up the letter, and make as good ſhift with it as he can, though his ſoul the mean while is ſtarved, and lies in famine and death for want of the bread of life, and a wrong thing is fed.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees</hi> made a great noiſe about the <hi>law</hi> and <hi>ordinances</hi> of <hi>Moſes,</hi> exclaiming againſt <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his diſciples as breakers and profaners of them; yet they themſelves did not truly honor <hi>the law and ordinances of Moſes,</hi> but their own <hi>doctrines, commandements and traditions.</hi> So theſe now who make a great noiſe about the Scriptures, and about the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions of the Apoſtles, do not honor the Scriptures, or the inſtitutions of the Apoſtles; but their own meanings, their own conceivings, their own inventions and imaginations there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon. They run to the Scriptures with that underſtanding which is out of the truth, and which never ſhall be let into the truth; and ſo being not able to reach and comprehend the truth as it is, they ſtudy, they invent, they imagine a meaning; they form a likeneſs, a ſimilitude of the truth as neer as they can, and this muſt go for the truth: and this they honor, and bow before as the will of God; which being not the will of God, but a likeneſs of their own inventing and forming, they worſhip not God, they honor not the Scriptures, but they ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor and worſhip the work of their own brain. And every Scripture which man hath thus formed a meaning out of, and hath not read in the true and living lights of Gods eternal ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, he hath made an image by, he hath made an idol of: and the reſpect and honor he gives this meaning, is not a reſpect and honor given to God but to his own image, to his own idol. Oh how many are your idols, ye <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians of England</hi> (as ye think your ſelves to be!) how many are your idols, ye gathered Churches! how full of images and idols are ye, ye ſpiritual Notioniſts, who have run from
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:52304:13"/>
one thing to another, with the ſame mind and ſpirit wherewith ye began at firſt! But the founder of images hath never been diſcovered and deſtroyed in you, and ſo he is ſtill at work a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong you all: and great will your ſorrow and diſtreſs be, when the Lords quick eye ſearcheth him out, and revealeth his juſt wrath againſt him.</p>
               <p>In my heart and ſoul I honor the Scriptures, and long to read them throughout with the pure eye, and in the pure light of the living ſpirit of God: but the Lord preſerve me from reading one line of them in my own-will, or interpreting any part of them according to my own underſtanding but only as I am guided, led and enlightened by him, in the will and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding which comes from him. And here all Scripture, every writing of Gods ſpirit, which is from the breath of his life, profitable to build up and perfect the man of God: but the inſtructions, the reproofs, the obſervations, the rules, the grounds of hope and comfort, (or whatever elſe) which man gathers out of the Scriptures, (he himſelf being out of the life) have not the true profit, nor build not up the true thing; but both the gatherings and the gatherer are for deſtruction. And the Lord will eaſe the Scripture of the burthen of mans formings and inventions from it, and recover its honor again, by the living preſence and power of that ſpirit that wrote it: And then it ſhall be no longer abuſed and wreſted by mans earthly and unlearned mind, but in the hand of the ſpirit, come to its true uſe and ſervice to the ſeed, and to the world.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>The true worſhip was loſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The true worſhip of God in the Goſpel, is in the ſpirit. <hi>The hour cometh, and now is, when the true worſhippers ſhall wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip the Father in ſpirit, and in truth; for the Father ſeeketh ſuch to worſhip him,</hi> Joh. 4. 23. The true worſhip is in the ſpirit, and in the truth, and the true worſhippers worſhip there, and ſuch worſhippers the Father ſeeks, and ſuch worſhip he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts: but all other worſhip is falſe worſhip, and all other worſhippers are falſe worſhippers, ſuch worſhippers as God ſeeks not, nor can accept their worſhip. Did God refuſe <hi>Cains</hi> ſacrifice formerly, and can he accept any ſacrifice, or worſhip now that's offered in that nature? why, he that wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:52304:13"/>
out of the ſpirit, he worſhips in that nature. But he that worſhips aright, muſt have his nature changed, and muſt worſhip in that thing wherein he is changed in that faith, in that life, in that nature, in that ſpirit whereby and whereto he is changed. For without being in this, and keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in this, it is impoſſible to pleaſe God in any thing. He that is the true worſhipper is a believer, and in his worſhip he muſt keep to his rule, the law of faith, the law of the ſpirit of life in him, the law which he receives by faith freſh from the ſpirit of life continually. He muſt heat and obſerve the voice of the living word in all his worſhip, and worſhip in the preſence and power and guidance of that, as that moves and as that carries on, or it is not worſhip in the ſpirit. I ſhall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance only in prayer. <hi>Praying alwaies with all prayer and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication in the ſpirit,</hi> Epheſ. 6. 18. Mark, <hi>all prayer and ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation</hi> muſt be <hi>in the ſpirit,</hi> yea it muſt be <hi>alwaies</hi> in the ſpirit, which ſpeaks in the heart to God, and makes the <hi>interceſſion,</hi> or is is no prayer. If a man ſpeak never ſo much from his own ſpirit, with never ſo much earneſtneſs and affection, yet it is no prayer, no true prayer, but only ſo far as the ſpirit moves to it, and ſo farr as the ſpirit leads and guids in it. If a man begin without the ſpirit, or go on without the ſpirit, this is out of the worſhip; this is in his own will (and ſo will-worſhip) and according to his own underſtanding (and ſo fleſhly worſhip) both which are to be crucified, and not to be followed in any thing under the Goſpel. <hi>Wee are the Circumciſion, which wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip God in the ſpirit,</hi> (here are the true worſhippers, <hi>the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion;</hi> and here's the true worſhip, <hi>in the ſpirit;</hi> and they have no bounds and limits in the fleſh, wherein their ſtrength and confidence is broke) <hi>and have no confidence in the fleſh.</hi> If a man addreſs himſelf to any worſhip of God without his ſpirit, hath he not confidence in the fleſh? If he begin without the ving of his ſpirit, doth he not begin in the fleſh? if he go on, without the ſpirits carrying on, doth he not proceed in the ſtrength and confidence of the fleſh? But the worſhip of the ſpirit, is in its will, and in its time, and is carried on by its light and power, and keeps down the underſtanding and affectionate part of man, wherein all the world worſhip, and offer up the unaccepted ſacrifices, even the <hi>lame</hi> and <hi>the blinde,</hi> which Gods ſoul hates.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="20" facs="tcp:52304:14"/>
Now this worſhip, as it is out of mans will and time, and in that which continueth, ſo it is continual. There is a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual praying unto God. There is a continual bleſſing and prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of his name, in eating, or drinking, or what ever elſe is done. There is a continual bowing to the majeſty of the Lord in every thought, in every word, in every action, though it be in worldly things and occaſions, yet the ſpirit of the Lord is ſeen there, and the tongue confeſſeth him there, and the knee boweth to him there: this is the true worſhip. And this is the reſt or ſabbath wherein the true worſhippers worſhip. When the creation of God is finiſhed, when the child is formed in the light; and the life breathed into him, then God brings him forth into his holy Land, where he keeps his Sabbath. They that are in the faith, which is the ſubſtance of the things hoped for under the Law, are come from all the ſhadows and types of the Law, and from all heatheniſh obſervation of dayes and times in the ſpirit of this world, where the ſpirit of man is hard at work, into the true Sabbath, into the true reſt, where they have no more to work, but God works all in them in his owntime, and according to his own pleaſure. <hi>We which have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, do enter into reſt,</hi> Ebr. 4. 3. <hi>and he that is entred into his reſt, hath ceaſed from his works, as God from his,</hi> verſ. 10. He that hath the leaſt taſte of faith, knows a meaſure of reſt finding the life working in him, and his ſoul daily led further and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther into life by the working of the life, and the heavy yoke of his own labouring after life taken of from his ſhoulders. Now here's the truth, here's the life, here's the ſabbath, here's the worſhip of the ſoul thats led into the truth, and preſerved in the truth.</p>
               <p>But what is the worſhip now in the Apoſtacy?</p>
               <p>Among the <hi>Papiſts</hi> a very groſſe worſhip, a worſhip more carnal then ever the worſhip of the Law was: for that though in its nature it was outward and carnal, yet it was taught and preſcribed by the wiſdom of God, and was profitable in its place, and to its end: but this was invented by the corrupt wiſdom, and ſet up in the corrupt wil of man, and hath no true profit, but keeps from the life, from the power, from the ſpirit in fleſhly obſervations, which feed and pleaſe the fleſhly na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Look upon their daies conſecrated to Saints, and their
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:52304:14"/>
canonical hours of Prayer, and their praying in an unknown tongue, with their faſtings, feaſtings, ſaying of Ave-Maries, Pater-noſters, Creeds, &amp;c. are not all theſe from the life, out of the ſpirit, and after the invention, and in the wil of the fleſh? Ah their ſtink is greater then the fleſh-pots of Egypt.</p>
               <p>And the worſhip of the Proteſtants comes too near them: for their worſhip is alſo from a fleſhly principle, and in their own times, and wils, and according to their own underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and apprehenſion of things, and not from the riſing up and guidance of the infallible life of the ſpirit in them (for that they will quench.) They alſo obſerve dayes, and times, and periſhing ordinances, and are not come out of the fleſh into that ſpirit, where the worſhip is to be know and to be in.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>The Faith, the true faith was loſt.</hi> The faith which gives vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory over the world; the faith which feeds the life of the juſt, and ſlayes the unjuſt; the faith which is pure, the myſtery whereof is held in a pure conſcience; the faith which gives en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance into the reſt of God; the faith which is the ſubſtance of things hoped for, and the evidence of things not ſeen; this hath been loſt, and is not yet to be found among thoſe who go for Chriſtians.</p>
               <p>For thoſe who challenge the name of Chriſtians, and ſay they believe in Chriſt, and have faith in him, cannot with their faith overcome the world, but are daily overcome by the world. Where is there a Chriſtian, but he is either in the honours, or in the faſhion, or in the cuſtomes, or in the worſhips of the world, if not in them all? He is ſo farre from overcoming theſe, that he is overcome with them: yea ſo overcome, ſo drunk therewith, that he hath even loſt his ſenſes, and thinks he may be a Chriſtian, and in a good ſtate, while he is there.</p>
               <p>And the life of the juſt is not fed by their faith, but the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt nature is fed, and the righteous witneſſe (which is raiſed up and lives by the true faith) is kept down, and cannot bring forth his life in them, becauſe of their unbelife: for that is the proper name of their faith; for being not true faith, it is not faith, but unbelief.</p>
               <p>And the faith of Chriſtians (ſo called) is not a myſtery, (they know not the myſtery of it, which is held in a pure con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience)
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:52304:15"/>
but conſiſts in believing an Hiſtorical relation, and in a fleſhly improving of that, and can be held in an impure con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.</p>
               <p>Neither are they entered into reſt by their faith: for they know not the Sabbath in the Lord, but are ſtill in a ſhadowy Sabbarh.</p>
               <p>Neither is it the ſubſtance of what they hope for, but the ſubſtance of what they hope for is ſtrange to them. They are not come <hi>to Mount Sion, to the City of the living God, the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Jeruſalem, to the innumerable company of Augels, to the general aſſembly and Church of the firſt born, to God the Judge, Chriſt the Mediator, and the blood of ſprinkling,</hi> and ſo to uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and certainty in the life: but are in opinions, waies and practiſes ſuitable to the earthly ſpirit which may eaſily be ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and muſt be ſhaken down to the ground, if ever they know the building of God, and the true faith.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>The love, the true love;</hi> the innocent love, which think no il, nor wiſhes no ill, much leſſe can do any il to any; but ſuffereth long, and is kind, meek, humble, not ſeeking its own, but the good of others, this love <hi>is loſt.</hi> The love unfain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed is baniſhed, and a fained love, ſuch a love as enmity and violence proceeds from, is got in the place of it. The true love loves the enemy, and cannot return enmity for enmity, but ſeeks the good of them who hate it: but this love can perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute and hate that which it calls the friend, nay the brother, becauſe of ſome difference in opinion or practice. The love that was in Chriſt, taught him to lay down his life for his ſheep: and he that hath the ſame love, can lay down his life for his brother. But the love that is now among Chriſtians, tends rather to the taking away of life.</p>
               <p>What is the love among the Papiſts? See their Inquiſitions, their wraths, their fire and fagot, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>What is their love in <hi>New-England?</hi> is it not a love that can impriſon or baniſh their brother, if he differ but a little from them in judgement or practiſe about their worſhip? yea they can whip, burn in the hand, cut off ears, juſt like the Biſhops of old <hi>England.</hi> If one had told them, when they fled from the perſecution of the Biſhops here, that they themſelves ſhould have done ſuch things, they would have been apt to reply with
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:52304:15"/>
                  <hi>Hazael,</hi> what, are we dogs? But they fled from the Croſs, which would have crucified that perſecuting ſpirit, and ſo carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it alive with them; and being alive, it grew by degrees to as great an head there, as it did in the Biſhops here.</p>
               <p>And what is the love here in old <hi>England?</hi> is it not a love that whips, ſtocks, impriſons, ſtones, jeeres? yea the very Teachers (which ſhould be patterns of love to others) they will caſt into priſon, and diſtrein the goods of their brother, even almoſt to his undoing for maintenance, according to a Law of the Land made in the Apoſtacy. See <hi>the Record of Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings for Tythes in England,</hi> which may make any tender heart bleed to read it, and is like to lie as a brand of infamy on the Magiſtracy and Miniſtry of <hi>England</hi> to ſucceeding ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations. Is this the love of the righteous ſeed? or is it <hi>Cains</hi> love which is in profeſſion, in word, in ſhew; but not <hi>in deed and in truth?</hi> And how can theſe love God? nay if the true love of God were in them, this enmity could not ſtand, nor ſuch fruits of it ſhoot forth. But they have not ſeen the father or the Son, and that life of them which appears in the earth, the evill ſpirit in man ſeeks to deſtroy, that he may keep up his own image and ſhadow of life, which the nature of the true life (in its appearance) fights againſt. <hi>By this ſhall all men know that ye are my Diſciple, if ye love one another.</hi> And by this may all men know, that thoſe that now go for Chriſtians are not Chriſts Diſciples, in that they do not love one another. They are not in unity in the light, and ſo cannot love one another there; but are onely in unity in forms, in opinions, in profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, in practiſes; ſo any difference there ſtirs up the enmity, cauſing riſings in the heart againſt them at leaſt, if it proceed not further. The true love grows from true union and fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip in the light, where that is not known, there cannot be true love in the ſpirit, but a fained love in the fleſh.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>The true hope, joy, and peace is loſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The true ground of <hi>hope,</hi> is Chriſt in the heart, and the true hope is that hope which ariſeth from this ground, from the feeling of Chriſt there, <hi>Chriſt in you the hope of Glory,</hi> Col. 1. 27. What is the true Chriſtians hope? it is Chriſt in him, he <hi>hath eternal life abiding in him,</hi> and he knows that cannot but
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:52304:16"/>
lead to glory. But what is the common Chriſtians hope? He faſtens his hope upon the relation and his beliefe of an Hiſtory. <hi>He that believeth ſhall be ſaved:</hi> I believe, therefore I ſhall be ſaved. And thus as he hath got up a wrong faith, and a wrong love, ſo he gets up a wrong hope. And this hope <hi>will periſh:</hi> for this is <hi>the hope of the Hypocrite,</hi> or an hope in the hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical nature, which complies with Scripture-words, but is not in union with God, nor with the life of the Scriptures; and ſo being without the anchor is toſſed in the waves of the Sea.</p>
               <p>And the true <hi>joy</hi> is in he ſpirit, from what is felt, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned, and hoped for there. But the common Chriſtians joy is from things which he gathers into, and comprehends in his underſtanding, or from flaſhes which he feels in his affectionate part, from a fire and ſparkes of his own kindling, from whence he fetches his warmth and comfort.</p>
               <p>And the true <hi>peace</hi> ſtands in the reconciliation with God, by having that broken down which cauſeth the wrath, and to which the wrath is, where ever it is found. <hi>The Lambe of God</hi> breaks down the wall of ſeparation in the heart, the blood of Jeſus (wherein is the life) clenſeth away the ſin there, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the heart pure, uniteth the pure heart to the pure God: here's union, here's fellowſhip, here's peace. But the common Chriſtians peace is from a miſ-underſtanding of Scriptures, while the wall of ſeparation is ſtanding, while wickedneſſe lodges in the heart. They reaſon themſelves (from Scripture words) into an apprehenſion that God is at peace with them, and that they are in union with him, while that of God which is in them witneſſeth againſt them, and checks them, and wars with them: and they are not one with it, nor cannot be in that nature and underſtanding wherein their life lies, to which belongs no peace.</p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>The true repentance, converſion, and regeneration hath been loſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The true <hi>Repentance</hi> is from dead works, and from the dead principle whence all the dead works proceed: but theſe have not been repented of; but periſhed in the apoſtacy. The pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the ſtriving, the worſhipping, the fighting hath been from the dead principle. The building up, and whole exerciſe of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:52304:16"/>
in the Apoſtacy, hath been in that underſtanding which is to be deſtroyed: and the will, which ſhould have been cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified, hath been pleaſed and fed with its religion.</p>
               <p>The true <hi>Converſion</hi> is from the power of Satan to God, from the darkneſſe to the light. But in the Apoſtacy men have not known God or Satan, the light or the darkneſſe, but have miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took, taking the one for the other, worſhipping the Devil in ſtead of God, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13. 4. and following the dark conceivings of their own and other mens minds concerning ſcripture, and calling them light.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Regeneration</hi> is a changing of man, whereby the birth is born of the Spirit: the ſtripping of the creature of its own nature, of its own underſtanding, of its own will, and forming it anew in the wombe of the Spirit: ſo that the old creature is paſſed away, and there comes forth a new thing, which growes up daily in the new life towards the fulneſſe of Chriſt. But men have been ſo far from being born of the ſpirit, that they have not ſo much as known the gift of the ſpirit in them; but to this day are enemies, and at a diſtance from that of God in them which is pure. And if they could but open their eyes, they would ſee that their birth is fleſhly, and conſiſts (at beſt) but in ſuch a conformity to the letter, as the old nature may imitate and attain: but the immortal ſeed is not ſprung up in them, nor they dead to the mortal, or alive to the immortal.</p>
               <p n="7">7. <hi>The true wiſdome, righteouſneſſe, ſanctification and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption is loſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The true <hi>wiſdom</hi> ſtands in the fear of God and departing from evil: This, thoſe that are taught of God learn, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by are made wiſe unto ſalvation. But moſt that are called Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, are not come to the fear of God, and many are got a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove it, looking upon it as legall, and not appertaining to the Goſpel; but the Goſpel ſtate is love, which caſteth out fear. Doth the love of God refuſe, or caſt out the fear of God? Nay it caſts out the fear that, brings bondage, the fear that came in by tranſgreſſion, which fear is ſtirred up and diſcovered by the Law. And this is a fear of ſin, or a fear ariſing from ſin, through the Law's manifeſtation of it, and the wrath againſt it, which cauſeth both the fear, and much bondage from the fear: And
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:52304:17"/>
this the Goſpel (which diſcovers the love, the mercy, the grace, the power, and unites to them) frees from and caſts out. But then there is a fear of God, a fear wrought in the heart by his ſpirit, a fear which is part of the new Covenant, <hi>(I will put my fear in their hearts, and they ſhall not depart from me)</hi> a fear which is part of the <hi>everlaſting Goſpel,</hi> Rev. 14. 6, 7. and <hi>endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth for ever,</hi> Pſal. 19. 9. And this fear is not bondage, but liberty; it is indeed bondage to the unjuſt, but liberty to the juſt: for where this fear is, ſin is departed from; it ſets free, it delivers the feet out of the ſnare of iniquity: there's true liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Can ſin prevail in that heart, where the pure clean fear of God is placed by God to keep it down? The love of God doth not caſt out this fear, but keeps in this fear: and this fear keeps the heart clean from the evil which defiles, and preſerves the love from the enmity, which ſprings up where this fear is not. Now this fear in the Apoſtacy was loſt, or elſe what needed there an eſpecial miniſtry to be raiſed up to preach it again, <hi>Rev.</hi> 14. 6. 7? And the eſtate of Chriſtians every where doth ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt this loſs, for their hearts are not kept clean, which ſheweth that the fear, (which doth keep clean, where it is) is wanting in them. There's pollution, there's filth, there's deceit, there's high-mindedneſs, ſelf-conceitedneſs, and love of the world and worldly vanities, and many other evils to be found in the hearts of thoſe that go for Chriſtians; and the purity of heart (which comes from the fear, and ſtands in the wiſdom) is not known They are wiſe to do evil, but want the knowledge to avoid the evil, and do the good: They are wiſe to get and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy the world, but know not the true riches: They are wiſe to gather together many Scripture-words againſt ſin, and yet ſtill keep the nature and life of it in the heart, and it as a ſweet morſel under the tongue: They are wiſe to apply promiſes to comfort themſelves with (when ſometimes they receive a juſt wound in their hearts from the righteous one) but know not that nature, or that eſtate and condition to which all the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes are made, but are yet in that nature, and in that eſtate and condition to which the curſe appertains.</p>
               <p>The true <hi>righeouſneſſe</hi> ſtands in the faith, in hearing and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beying the word of faith. How comes the righteouſneſſe of the law, but by hearing and obeying the voice of the Law?
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:52304:17"/>
And how comes the righteouſneſſe of the Goſpel, but by hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and obeying the <hi>word of faith,</hi> who is preached, and the Preacher of righteouſneſſe in the heart? The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> makes this compariſon, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. The righteouſneſſe of the Law ſpeaketh on this wiſe, <hi>The man that doth thoſe things, ſhall live in them:</hi> But how ſpeaketh the word of faith? <hi>The word is nigh thee, in thy mouth, and in thy heart,</hi> he that doth that, he that heareth that, ſhall live in that. <hi>The hour is coming, and now is, when the dead ſhall hear the voyce of the Son of God: and they that hear ſhall live.</hi> Diſobedience to the Law is unrighteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and brings death; and diſobedience to the living word is unrighteouſneſſe, and cannot be juſtified, but condemned: and obedience to it cannot be condemned, but juſtified: So that when the ſoul hears, believes, and obeyes, then it is juſtified: then its former ſins are forgotten, and this is imputed to it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to righteouſneſſe. But when the ſoul will not hear, will not believe, will not obey; this unbelief is judged in him, and his ſins retained, and not remitted. Now is not this a juſt and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall way of juſtification, O ye ſons of men? is not your way unequal? ſhall a man continue in the unbelief and rebellion againſt Chriſt, againſt the light, againſt the faith; and yet be juſtified by Chriſt, by the light, by the faith? This cannot be, Gods way of imputation will ſtand; but mans invented way of imputation, which ſprung up in the Apoſtacy, will not ſtand. If we walk in the light, as he is in the light; the blood clen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, but not otherwiſe. If we walk after the ſpirit, and not after the fleſh, there is no condemnation, and not otherwiſe. The true Baptiſm is the plunging down of the old thing, with all its filth; and the raiſing up of a new thing: and it is the new thing, the circumciſion, the baptiſm which is juſtified. God juſtifieth his Son, and man onely ſo far as he is bound in his Son.</p>
               <p>The true <hi>ſanctification</hi> conſiſts in the growth of the ſeed, and its ſpreading (like a leaven) over the heart, and over the whole man. By faith Chriſt is formed in the heart, the hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den man in the miſtery is formed there: and as this ſeed, this leaven, this man growes; ſo he makes the man holy in whom he grows. The ſeed of life, the Kingdom of heaven is an holy thing; and as it grows and ſpreads, it purgeth out the old lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:52304:18"/>
and makes the lump new. But now, in Chriſtians that have grown up in the Apoſtacy, this ſeed is not known, this leaven is not ſo much as diſcerned; but their holineſſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in a conformity to rules of Scripture, received into the old heart and underſtanding. And what a noiſe hath this made in the world, all this night of the Apoſtacy, as if this were the heir, and ſhould inherit the Kingdom: Nay, nay, The heir hath appeared (by whoſe preſence it is ſeen, that this is not the heir) and ye ſhall not be able to kill him, but he ſhall live to enjoy his inheritance, and the inheritance ſhall not be yours.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Redemption</hi> conſiſts in being bought, by the price of the life, out of ſin, out of death, out of the earth, out of the power of the devil. It is a caſting off the ſtrong man out of the heart (with all that he brought in) and a delivering from his power. It is a diſſolving of the work of ſin, which the Devil hath wrought in the heart, and a ſetting the ſoul (which is immortal) at liberty; free from ſin, and free unto righteouſneſſe: this is the true Redemption. But this redemption in the Apoſtacy is a fained redemption; wherein ſalvation from ſin, and the Devil, and his power, is not felt: but the ſtrong man is ſtill in the heart, and keeps the ſoul in death, and brings forth fruits of death daily.</p>
               <p>The Chriſtians formerly (in the firſt day of the breaking forth of Gods power) had Chriſt in them, the living word; opened their hearts to him, received him in, felt him there, ſound him made of God to them their <hi>wiſdom,</hi> their <hi>righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,</hi> their <hi>ſanctification,</hi> their <hi>redemption,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 30. They had the thing that theſe words ſignifie, and ſpeak of, and knew the meaning of the words by feeling of the thing. But Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians now, in the Apoſtacy, have got ſeveral apprehenſions from the words, without feeling the thing the words ſpeak of, and ther lies their Religion. And now the true heir being come, holding forth the thing they have been all talking of, all Sects upon the earth are mad againſt him, and would fain kill him. They would not have the living ſubſtance (which is the heir) live, and nothing be eſteemed life but that; but they would have their dead apprehenſions from the words live, and their dead forms and practiſes owned: and the heir of life muſt
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:52304:18"/>
come in their way, in the way that they have hoped and wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for him, or they will not own him. Awake, awake, O ye Sons of the Apoſtacy, and of the night, riſe up out of the fleſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wiſdom, out of the dead fleſhly interpretations of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, out of the dead invented forms of worſhip, and bow to the Heir, kiſs the Son, leſt ye feel the force of that dreadful ſentence, <hi>Thoſe mine enemies,</hi> which would not <hi>that I ſhould reign over them, bring hither, and ſlay them before me.</hi> For of a truth the great Prophet is ariſen, and ſpeaks in the heart, and his ſheep hear his voice (there are many faithful witneſſes thereof) and he that will not hear his voice, muſt be cut off; there is no avoiding of it: for the two-edged ſword is in his hand, and he will cut down the tranſgreſſor.</p>
               <p n="8">8. <hi>The Church, the true Church was loſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The true Church was a company gathered out of the world into God, begotten of and gathered into his life, by the living word, and ſo had a true place and habitation in God. The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> writing to the <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> ſtiles them a Church in God. A Church under the Goſpel is made up of true Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites, gathered out of their own ſpirits and natures, into the meaſure of the ſpirit of God in them, as Chriſt was into the fulneſſe. They are ſuch as are begotten of God, born of his ſpirit, led by him out of Egypt, through the wilderneſſe to Sion the holy mount, there they meet with the elect precious corner ſtone which is laid in Sion, and they being living ſtones are built upon it into Jeruſalem the holy City, 1 <hi>Pet</hi> 2. 5, 6. <hi>Ebr.</hi> 12. 22. This is the true Church. Every one that believes in Chriſt, is a living ſtone, and being a living ſtone, he is laid upon the living foundation, and ſo is a part of the building in the Temple of the living God. Yea his body and and ſpirit be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing clenſed, he himſelf is a Temple wherein God dwels, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, and is worſhipped. And the gathering of any of theſe together at any time in the life, in the name of Chriſt, is a larger Temple, and ſuch a Temple as Chriſt never fails to be in the midſt of. But the great Temple, the ful Church is the general aſſembly of the firſt-born. This is the unerring pillar and ground of truth. This alwaies bare up truth, truth never failed here; but when it was at any time loſt in the world, it
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:52304:19"/>
might from hence be recovered again when God pleaſed, and as far as he pleaſed. Indeed the Law of the Lord hath alwaies gone forth from this Sion, and the living word from this Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem:</p>
               <p>But what hath the Church been in the Apoſtacy? a building of ſtone, ſay ſome: and that not onely among Papiſts, but here in <hi>England</hi> alſo, many have called the old Maſs-houſe a Church, a Temple, the houſe of God, pleading for it to be a holy place; and have ſhowed it by their practiſes, keeping off their hats while they were in it.</p>
               <p>Others ſay, not the ſtone building, but the people that meet there, is the Church: whereof many are openly prophane, yea ſo far from being gathered into the ſpirit, and ſo ignorant of his motions, that they are ready to ſcoffe, if they hear a man ſpeak of being moved by the ſpirit. What are theſe? are theſe living ſtones, whereupon the true Church alone can be built? are theſe children of the day? Nay theſe are children of the night, children brought up in the Apoſtacy from the true light, the true life, the true rule of Chriſtianity, the true wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, the true faith, the true love, &amp;c. and ſo are dead ſtones in that building, but not true living ſtones in Gods build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>Other ſorts ſeparate from theſe, and gather Congregations out of theſe; but ſtill in the ſame ſpirit, in the ſame nature, being not themſelves gathered out of the Apoſtacy from the ſpirit, into the ſpirit again; and ſo they build but with the ſame ſtones as were in the old building, and not with the new and living ſtones, and ſo are but a more refined appearance of a Church, but not a true Church. Not a Church in God, and by the gathering of his ſpirit; but of their own gathering, after a form, according as they have imagined from their reading and ſtudying of the Scriptures,</p>
               <p n="9">9. (Which may be the laſt inſtance) <hi>The Miniſtry, the true Miniſtry hath been loſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The true Miniſtry was a miniſtry made and appointed by the ſpirit, by the gift of the Spirit beſtowed on them, and by the ſpirit ſending of them, and appointing them to their work. Chriſt bid his Apoſtles and Diſciples wait at Jeruſalem for the promiſe of the ſpirit; and when he had given them the
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:52304:19"/>
ſpirit, he gave them to the Church for the work of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. 11. 12. <hi>Act.</hi> 20. 28. And if none can be a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the true Church, but by being begotten out of death into life by the ſpirit, ſurely none can be able to miniſter to him who is ſo begotten, but by the ſame ſpirit. So theſe receiving their Miniſtry of the Lord Jeſus, <hi>Act.</hi> 20. 24. and the gift of the ſpirit from him, they were made <hi>able Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the new Teſtament, not of the letter, but of the ſpirit,</hi> 2 Cor. 3. 6. They were able in God, to miniſter from his ſpirit to the ſpirits of his people. And they did not miniſter a literal knowledg of things to the underſtanding of man: but they led men to the ſpirit of God, and miniſtred ſpiritual things to that ſpiritual underſtanding which was given them of God. Neither did they make uſe of their own wiſdom and art, to tickle the natural ear; but ſpake to the conſcience, with the demonſtration of the ſpirit, in the ſight of God, as it pleaſed the ſpirit to give them utterance.</p>
               <p>But how have Miniſters been made in the Apoſtacy; By or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders from men, ſet up in their own wils, after their own inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. And how have they been qualified, but by humane arts and languages, which have been of high eſteem in that which men call the Church, ſince the language and skill of the ſpirit of God hath been loſt; God (who choſe in his own Church) doth not chuſe here, who ſhall be his Miniſters; but any man can appoint his Son to be a Miniſter, if he will but educate him in learning, and ſend him to the Univerſity, and ſo bring him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that way of order wherein men make Miniſters: and then he is able to miniſter unto man, the things of man, according to human skil. And this in the dark night of apoſtacy, muſt go for a true call to the miniſtery of God. Indeed they are as true Miniſters, as the Church is to which they miniſter: but they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver were, nor never can be thus made Miniſters of the Church of God: but as God alone can form and build his Church, ſo he alone can fit and appoint the Miniſters thereof. And though others, having ſeen the groſſenes of this, make their miniſters by a call in their Church, yet neither is that out of the apoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, but onely a ſtriving of man to get out of it, which man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not poſſibly do, till he meet with the ſpirit of God to lead out of it. So that that Miniſtry alſo is but an invention of man
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:52304:20"/>
made by man, and comes not from the ſpirit, nor is able to mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter ſpirit to the ſpirit.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But hath there been no true Religion ſince the daies of the Apoſtes? no true rule, no true worſhip, no true faith, no true love, no true hope joy or peace, no true repentance, conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion &amp; regeneration, no true wiſdom, righteouſnes, ſanctification and redemption, no true Church, no true Miniſtry? What hath become of all our fore-fathers? did they all periſh? And hath not this miniſtry converted many to God? were not yee your ſelves converted by it? Nay have not many of them been Martyrs, and witneſſed to the truth of God? And though ſome of them are bad, yet are not many of them zealous and conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entious Preachers of the Word at this day? By ſuch reaſonings as theſe, the wiſdom of man much ſtrengthens and hardens it ſelfe againſt the truth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> The rule in Nations, the worſhip in Nations, the faith, love, hope, joy, peace, repentance, converſion, regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, &amp;c. which have been cried up in Nations for the truth, the Churches in Nations, the Miniſtry in Nations; all theſe have been corrupted, and never recovered their true ſtate to this day. There have been changes from one thing to another, but the reſtauration hath not been known. The whoriſh ſpirit hath been hunted &amp; puriued, and ſo run out of one form into another, traverſing her way, and changing her ground and gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, but hath not been taken and judged to the death: and the true ſpirit hath not been able to find the bed of her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, but hath wandered from mountain to hil, all the time of this cloudy and dark day, forgetting her reſting place.</p>
               <p>Yet, though the whole earth was corrupted, and falſe do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and worſhip ſet up every where among the Nations, which continued the fornication and whoredom from the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of life in the publick wayes and national worſhips; not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding this, even all this while God reſerved a ſeed to himſelfe, which he cauſed to ſpring up in a remnant, and which he moved and carried on to witneſſe againſt ſomewhat of theſe corruptions, in their ſeveral ages and generations. And as faſt as the beaſt killed and knocked down theſe, God raiſed up more: yea though the whoriſh ſpirit, in ſome Nations, painted her ſelf curiouſſy, leaving ſome of the groſſe Doctrines and Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:52304:20"/>
of Popery, and got into a more refined way: yet God raiſed up witneſſes againſt her there alſo, and ſtill doth into what form ſoever ſhe gets: for though of late ſhe hath decked her ſelf very pleaſingly, as ſhe think, and covered her ſelfe round with ſcripture-words and profeſſions, and practiſes as like as ever ſhe can form them to the practiſes of former Saints, yet quick and lively is the ſpirit of God that ſearcheth after her, who hath found her out, and raiſed up witneſſes againſt her there alſo.</p>
               <p>Now this ſeed, this remnant, though they were not able to recover the poſſeſſion of the life and power that was loſt, yet they had a true taſte of it, and their teſtimony which they gave out from that taſte, was true: and ſo far as they kept to this teſtimony, in the faith and in the patience which they had lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and received from God, (though but in a low meaſure) they were accepted of him. So that all were not loſt in this night of darkneſs, but ſuch as feared God, and knew and heark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to his voice, had the teſtimony of his preſence with them, and taſted of his life and power in meaſure: God was not an hard maſter to them, but tender and gentle, and contented to reap what he ſowed. But the appearance of God, in this dark time was weak, and low, and eaſie to be made a prey of. And this is very obſervable, that ſo long as the ſimplicity ran pure it was preſerved, but ſo ſoon as ever the ſpirit of man was tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted either into any old, or into any new invented form, the wiſdom of the fleſh got in with it, grew up more than it, and when it had gathered ſtrength, corrupted the veſſel, betrayed the ſimplicity, and loſt the life. Thus many pretious beginnings and buddings forth of life, have been betrayed in theſe late daies. There was a pretious thing ſtirring in Queen <hi>Maries</hi> dayes, the life whereof was more hurt, and ſuppreſſed, by that dead form of <hi>Epiſcopacy,</hi> ſucceeding afterwards, then by the foregoing perſecution. The perſecution did clear and brighten it, but the fleſhly form of <hi>Epiſcopacy</hi> brought death over it. And the forms of <hi>Presbytery, Independency, Anabaptiſm,</hi> have been little leſſe then graves to bury and keep down the life. How many ſpirits, that had a precious ſavour in them at their entrance into thoſe forms, did ſoon become fleſhly, earthly, and very unſavory, looſing the quickneſſe and freſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:52304:21"/>
that was in them before, and falling into the deadneſs of the form, withering with it.</p>
               <p>And as touching the Miniſtry, though in it ſelf it was evill, being in the degeneration from the true Miniſtry, all this time of the Apoſtacy; and the perſons therein for the moſt very cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt, being brought up to it as to a trade, and making uſe of it as a trade: yet I do believe that there was a ſimplicity of heart in ſome perſons among them, which did cauſe them in ſome degree of faithfulneſſe, to ſeek the Lord, his ſervice, and the good of ſouls. And in the time of ignorance and darkneſs, it pleaſed God to wink at, and over-look the evill; and to cauſe good to paſſe from the good in them to the good in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, through the evil that hung about both. And this was the great tenderneſs of the Lord, in pitty to his poor creatures (who were very deſtitute to help in the thick night of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs) and ſhould not now be made uſe of to juſtifie and keep up the evil. Do ye thus requite the Lord, O fooliſh people and unkind? Becauſe his mercy and goodneſs extended to you not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the evil (which might have hindered) will ye make that an argument to keep up the evill, and to oppoſe the light which diſcovers it? Becauſe God cauſeth light to ſhine through the darkneſs, and viſiteth man in the dark, wil ye ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſet up the darkneſs as his proper way of miniſtration? The corrupt way, call, and exerciſe of the corrupt miniſtry, could not keep out the tender love of God, but he had reſpect to the ſimplicity of ſome who were found in it, and to the ſimplicity of others who waited on him for inſtruction there, and did pleaſe to give ſome anſwer to both. And will ye make this uningenious uſe of it, to interpret it as his approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that miniſtry, which ſprung up in the Apoſtacy from him, among thoſe that were apoſtatiſed, and is a great diſhonour to him, and the abhorring of his ſoul? A miniſtry of Chriſt, a miniſtry ſet up by his ſpirit is precious; but a miniſtry made by man, according to his will, and miniſtring in his wiſdom, the ſoul of the Lord beareth as a burthen, and is preſſed with it; and as he raiſeth up his own life, wil eaſe himſelf of it. And what do they miniſter from, but the literal part of the Scriptures, which killeth and cannot give life? and what do they miniſter with, but their own underſtanding part? what meanings they can invent, what deductions the wiſdom can draw from the
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:52304:21"/>
Scriptures, but do not ſee the true meaning in the infallible and unerring light: and what do they miniſter to, but the underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding part in you? whereas there is ſomewhat elſe to be mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred to by the true Miniſter; and what do they miniſter to you, but food for the underſtanding, food for the ſerpentine wiſdom, which alwaies fed upon knowledge, but never upon the true bread? and hereby another thing is fed in you, and not your ſouls, but they are kept in leanneſs and barrenneſs, under death and the bondage of corruption (which <hi>Paul</hi> cryed out upon as a wretched ſtate, and could find no eaſe, reſt, or free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom from condemnation there) and without the true life and redemption. I do do not deny but ye may there meet with ſome kind of warmth in the affectionate part, which may be heated by a fire and ſparks of mans kindling and blow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up, and this may go for life with you now: but in the preſence of the truth, where the eye is opened, it vaniſheth: yea the ſpirit of the Lord hath ſo blown upon it, that it is even withered in the ſight of a more inferiour eye in many peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>

Mark, the Goſpel that was preached to the Nations, all the time of the Apoſtacy, was not the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Goſpel, that Goſpel did not bring life and immortali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to life, but they were hid from mens eyes, and men had only a ſound of words in ſtead of the thing: And thus poor Nations, kindreds, people, tongues, were every where bewitched with a form of things, with an outward knowledg, a periſhing know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg in the periſhing part, a vain traditional invented worſhip, which ſtands in the wiſdom and will of man, but had no uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and fellowſhip with that which is everlaſting. And thus all the Nations in the ſmoke of the bottomleſſe pit, run into the pit from whence the ſmoke came. But the Lord hath a time to pitty the poor Nations, and to ſend forth his true everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Goſpel again, to deliver the Nations from that witchery, and ſorcery, and ſpiritual inchantment which got up in the dark. And as this everlaſting light ſprings up, then down goes <hi>Babylon,</hi> down go all invented doctrines, all invented forms, all invented worſhips, and that wiſdom and evill ſpirit that raiſed them up. <hi>Babylon is fallen, is fallen, that great City, becauſe ſhe made all Nations drunk of the wine of the cup of her fornication,</hi> Rev. 14. 1, And now the new wine of the kingdom, which is taſted of in the everlaſting Goſpel, purges out the old wine; and the drunkenneſſe, which thereby came upon the Nations, waſts. And they that have taſted of this life, and know this life, can never be bewitched back again, by the whoriſh ſpirit, to dead forms <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

Indeed the beaſt hath had all the ſtrength of the Nations, and the whore hath had all the wiſdom, all the eſteem, all the honor: who can make war with the beaſt? who can ſhew miracles and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders like the falſe Prophets? who can teach but the wiſe, learned, orthodox men, that have the arts, and know the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal?

yea there's another that can make war, and a Prophet, that can preach better then them, one that can preach life, one that can preach the everlaſting Goſpel, and knows the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal of it, one that is wiſer and ſtronger then the whore, and by his wiſdom and ſtrength is able to judge her, and caſt her out of the Nations, though ſhe hath got very ſtrong poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, <hi>Rev.</hi> 18. 8.

They that are in the faith, which hath ſince been gathered into the underſtanding, and did not ſpring up from the myſtery of life, in the heart, are not in the true faith. The ſame may be ſaid of love, hope, joy, peace, and all the reſt mentioned before, yea and all other things in religion, for all hath been corrupted, even the inward part. And while here hath been a great contention about forms of worſhip, and Church-Government, the power of godlineſſe, and the Government of Chriſt in the heart hath been loſt.</p>
               <p>Obſerve diligently what I have now to ſay. When the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, who had the true Miniſtry, preached the Goſpel, they ſtirred and raiſed up the power of God in the heart, and the power of ſin, corruption and deceit ſunk down, and was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der foot, and trampled upon by the power. But when Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt and the falſe Prophets aroſe, they raiſed up the corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on again, and fed it with doctrines of deceit, but the power ſunk down, and was not felt, but buried all that time of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing of the corruption and deceit. Now the power was not loſt all this while in it ſelf, but onely loſt to man, ſo that he knew not where to find it. Yet this power in this time of loſs did ſtir and move, and make men in ſome degree ſenſible of the loſſe, cauſing them to part and ſeek after the living truth. And this was good, this was of God. But then there was an evil ſpirit, which was neer to the good, and lay lurking in the ſerpentine wiſdom of the heart, and that drew the mind (which was bent toward the ſeeking of a right thing) a wrong way, that cryed <hi>loe here, loe there;</hi> look into the Scriptures, the Church was ſo and ſo; go get into ſuch a thing: the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans there did ſo and ſo, go do ſuch a thing: there's the way, there thou ſhall meet with the life and the power. And thus it drew from that which ſtirred within, into an imitation of a form without, and there they came to a loſſe. I dare appeal to all honeſt hearts, Was there not a good thing ſtirring in you,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:52304:23"/>
when ye went into your Church forms? were ye not led into ſimplicity, hoping to meet with life and power there? did ye find it ſo? did ye meet with the life and power there? nay did ye not loſe it there, and become deader? I know, if ye have not forgotten the taſte of life, ye will confeſse to me, that that which now ye have is not life, but far ſhort of that which ye had, when ye entred into your form. Ah poor hearts, the whore betwitched you, the harlot in your boſomes, and the falſe Prophets without, helped to increaſe the witchery, crying lo here and lo there, but ye knew no that the kingdom of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven was within, from whence that ſtirring of life was in you, where ye ſhould have kept, and not have gone forth. But now ye are dead and buried in your graves, lying there without ſenſe and are now got into the ſpirit of the world, and into the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity againſt that life in others, which was then your own life. And do ye know where ye are, and what ye are doing? Can ye bear to hear it?</p>
               <p>Of a truth ye are in the ſnare of the enemy, in the inchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from the life, in the whores bed, in the ſtrumpets bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, and not in the boſome of your beloved. And your practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes are branches of the ſornication, parcels of the whoredom, inventions which have been gathered in by that underſtanding, and ſet up by that will which whored from God. They are the effects and products of the whores cup, which gets new dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, new habits, new forms, new wayes to coſen and deceive the ſimple with; but ſtill ſhe remains the whore, and thoſe who are ſeduced by her, are led into her whoredom. For when God diſcovers and hunts her out of one form, then ſhe decks her ſelf with another, perhaps more ſeemingly ſpiritual, more Scripture like, and ſo more likely to take with the ſimple heart: and then ſhe lies in wait for the young man to entrap him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, ſaying, <hi>Come in hither,</hi> This is the true way of God without doubt; did not the Saints meet with life here formerly? Come thou hither alſo, heres the bed of thy beloved, take thy fil of life, thy fill of love. And thus the poor honeſt ſimple heart followes her, going like a fool to the correction of the ſtocks not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that it is for his life, until he come to feel the loſs of life. And there if ſhe find ſhe cannot keep him there, but freſh ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings of life ſpring up in him again, and withdraw him from
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:52304:24"/>
that which had deceived him, then ſhe paints again, and lies in wait for him again, to catch him in ſome more refined appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, or in ſome elevated notion, or at leaſt in the ſhadow of that which was true: for the whore hath not onely art and power to invent forms and likeneſſes of that which is true, and make Idols and Images of them: but it hath power alſo given it over the outward Court, ſo that that which is found there, it can make idols and images of. That which is corruptible, it can get into and corrupt, and make an enemy to that life, which lived in it before it was corrupted: and when it is corrupted, then there is no more truth or life to be found there, but the Idol, and the idolatry.</p>
               <p>The Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> who fore-warned of Antichriſt, and gave a mark whereby he might be known, namely by his not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing Chriſt come in the fleſh, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. 3. (which he that ſetteth up any thing of the old Covenant, or any invention or imitation of any thing therein, doth not) he bids alſo beware of Idols. <hi>Little Children, keep your ſelves from Idols,</hi> 1 Joh. 5. 21. Now what is an Idol? The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>An Idol is nothing in the world.</hi> An Idol is no true thing in its place, but a falſe thing ſet up in ſtead of the true. A falſe conception of God in the mind, is an Idol. A falſe Church or Temple, is an Idol: a falſe Miniſter, who is not made according to the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment of God, and by the gift of his Spirit, but came in another way, by the appointment of men, is an Idol-ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd: and the worſhip in this Church, and by this miniſtry, is publique Idolatry; and all the worſhip in families, which hath been erected after the ſame maner, is without the guidance of the ſpirit of God, is private Idolatry. Were the heathens Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, Altars, Prieſts, Sacrifices, and other inventions of theirs (in imitation of the Jews) Idolatrous? and are not the inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the heatheniſh ſpirit, or Antichriſtian nature in man, are not they alſo Idolatrous?</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> The praying which God appointed is not Idolatry. Praying in the Spirit of God, when he moves, and according to the will of God, which is onely known in the Spitit, is not I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatry;

but thy praying in thine own ſpirit, and at thine own times, and according to thine own wil (perhaps in way of imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the Jewiſh morning and evening Sacrifices) this is Idolatry. This is that which thou háſt ſet up, in ſtead of that which God ſet up, and ſo it is not the true thing which God ſet up, but an Idol of thine own making: and ſo thou wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippeſt not God therein, but that ſpirit which helped thee to invent and ſet up the Idol. The ſame might be ſaid concerning preaching, ſinging, waſhing with water, breaking of bread, and what ever elſe is practiſed in Religion upon theſe terms.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But doth not the Scripture mention theſe things? and did not the Saints practiſe theſe things? ſurely they were not Idolaters. Can I be an Idolater in practiſing that which they practiſed?</p>

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Nay, thou art miſtaken; they are not the things which they practiſed. The ſtreſs of their Religion lay in the life of it, in the preſence of the ſpirit of God in it: it was his breath made it the truth. Now if thou couldſt have the ſame things that they had, yet without the ſame living breath, they would be but dead things, but Idols. But thou haſt not the true form of things neither, thou haſt not the true Church, the true Miniſtry, the true Ordinances according to the form, but things ſet up in their ſtead, by the invention of man, in the time of the Apoſtacy from the true things, and what can theſe be, but Idols;</p>

                  <hi>The world wondered after the beaſt, and they worſhipped the Dragon which gave power unto the beaſt, and they worſhipped the beaſt,</hi> Rev. 13. 3, 4. Behold what was worſhipped at the time of the Apoſtacy! That which aroſe from the beaſtly invention of man, and not from the true ſpirit of life. And the inventing and ſetting up of theſe, and worſhipping according to theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions, is worſhipping the Dragon, (for he getteth in and lodgeth in mans inventions) and not the living God. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, at the end of this Apoſtacy, raiſeth up a new mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry to recal the Nations from worſhipping the Dragon, to the worſhip of God again, <hi>ver.</hi> 6. 7. of that Chapter, <hi>What the Gentiles ſacrificed</hi> of old, <hi>they ſacrificed to Devils, and not to God,</hi> 1 Cor. 10. 20. And what the late Gentiles ſacrifice, (I mean Chriſtians in the heatheniſh nature, Chriſtians to
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:52304:25"/>
whom the outward court was given, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. 2. and who have not a profeſſion of the Saints words and practiſes, but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out life) they ſacrifice not to God neither, but to that ſpirit that helped them to invent, and form a likeneſſe or image of the truth. Tranſgreſſing the principle of God within, they go from God, and from his worſhip; and the Devil (who went out from the truth) gets in, and they go into his power, and whatever they perform, in worſhip there, is to him: for when they go from the principle of God in them, the Devil gets into their hearts, and God goes out, and his true life, po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer and worſhip is not known, but an image or likeneſs which the Devil ſets up in ſtead of the true thing. So then, in that ſtate, let men conſider what they worſhip: for there they cry up ordinancies and duties, and kill one another about them, thinking that they worſhip and honour God thereby; but know not, nor are come to that wherein God alone can be worſhipped and honoured.</p>

                  <hi>I know the blaſphemy of them which ſay they are Jews, and are not, ſaith the ſpirit,</hi> Rev. 2. 9. is this blaſphemy? For a man to call himſelf a Chriſtian, who is not, what is that? to call that a Church which is not, what is that? to call him a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter of Chriſt, who is not, what is that? to call thoſe the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances of Chriſt which are not, what is that? to call that faith which is not, that juſtification which is not, &amp;c. what is that? Can ye ſpy out the blaſphemer? ye have made a great out-cry againſt him long, are ye willing now he ſhould be put to death? The Lord hath lighted his candle, he is ſearching for him, and he will find him out: and as he have deſired, ſo it ſhall be; the Lord will not ſpare him. O be awakened, be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakened, ye heatheniſh Chriſtians; Open the eye that can ſee, and behold where ye are, and what ye are doing, and how faſt ye are running into the pit. Ye have forgotten God, ye have loſt the true line of judgement, ye have loſt the key of knowledg, and the light that is in you is darkneſs, and leads to darkneſs, though ye cannot poſſibly believe it. Oh come back to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of God, and and to true holineſſe (without which no man ſhall ſee him: for the wicked ſhall be turned into hel, and all the Nations that forget God, and ye have forgotten him days without number.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>THat the onely way of recovery out of the Apoſtacy, is by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning to, and keeping in that ſpirit, from which the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtacy was.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Apoſtacy came by leaving the ſpirit of God, and run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning after another ſpirit: and the recovery muſt be by leaving that other Spirit, and returning to the ſpirit of God again. How did Chriſtians formerly begin their Religion? They began in the Spirit, <hi>Gal,</hi> 3. 3. and ſo they were to go on to perfection, and not intermix any thing of the fleſh. And had the anoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing been kept to, Antichriſt and the myſtery of iniquity had been kept out; and where that is returned to, the Antichriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an ſpirit is purged out by degrees, and the wayes thereof diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered and forſaken. Therefore know the whoriſh Spirit in thy ſelf, which is buſy to form likeneſſes in thy mind to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce thee, and to make thee fall in love with the likeneſſes which ſhe hath formed in other mens minds: and let her not deceive thee with her paint and gawdy appearances: but know likewiſe the little ſeed of life, from which truth ſprings up in thee, and in which the ſpirit of truth dwels, and is to be found; and take heed leaſt the ſerpentine wiſdom teach thee to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe and turn from it. From this ſpring it was that truth ſprung up in the witneſſes, all the time of the Apoſtacy: for they had their <hi>teſtimony</hi> from <hi>the ſpirit of Propheſie,</hi> Rev. 19. 10. So far as they kept to that, they gave a true teſtimony: ſo far as their own ſpirits mixed with it, they corrupted it. But to abide in that was very hard, and there was need of much affliction and perſecution to keep the fleſh down, and to preſerve the life pure. But as the life ſprings up more ſtrongly, and overcomes that ſpirit inwardly, (I mean the wiſe, fleſhly ſpirit) there wil be leſs need of outward afflictions or perſecutions, yea or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward either; but there will be a ſafe entrance into, and abiding in the joy, the reſt, the peace, where the whore within (which ſeduced from the life, where the power is, into ſome form, where the power is not) is burnt. Learn then, and know in
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:52304:26"/>
thy ſelf that ſpirit of propheſy, which ſpake in all the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs. Hear that, come to that, keep to that: feel the union, the fellowſhip, the ſpreading of that in thee. When that bids thee go, go<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when that bids thee come, come: when that bids thee do this, do it. But the fleſh is grown ſtrong, and ſtrongly reſiſteth this ſpirit, both inwardly and outwardly; and will not ſuffer him to riſe up in the heart, or to riſe up in the Nation: but at any time when he ſtirreth, and offers to ſpeak, or lead to God; there's a reaſon riſes up in the fleſhly wiſdom, that knocks him down, and denies his voice, and hearkens to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther voice in ſtead of his. Thus they firſt give way to the fleſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wiſdom, and ſuppreſs the truth in themſelves, and then they would go forth and ſuppreſs it in others: and they think them mad, and their rage riſeth againſt them, where the truth is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to grow, and mans reaſon or fleſhly wiſedom denyed. And thus is <hi>the Lord of Glory</hi> evil intreated, and ſlain at this day by this generation of Chriſtians, as he was by the <hi>Jewes</hi> ſlain formerly in the Prophets, in that his appearance in a fleſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly form, and in his Apoſtles: and his blood will be required; for the earth ſhall not alwaies drink it up and cover it, nor the adulterous woman be alwaies able to wipe her mouth, and ſay ſhe hath done no wickedneſs. Ye have ſaved alive the unjuſt, and killed the juſt. The murthering nature is alive in you, O ye Chriſtians, but the holy one is ſlain, and lies buried in your graves: and ye have painted your graves, and ſpeak good words of him, but ſtill keep him down, and let another riſe up and live in you. Ye cry up that appearance of Chriſt in the fleſh, and the words he then ſpake, and the words of his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, and think that if he had lived in thoſe dayes, ye would not have killed either him or his Apoſtles, and yet ye reſiſt and oppoſe the ſame life in your ſelves and in others, with ſuch a kind of wiſdom in the letter, as the Phariſees had. O what will ye do! the uncircumciſed ear is got up in you, and ye cannot hear; and the uncumciſed heart, and ye cannot underſtand; but when this is told you, ye deſpiſe, and wonder, and go on in the periſhing ſtate. My bowels, my bowels, I am pained at my bowels! O <hi>England, England,</hi> thou that killedſt the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs in Queen <hi>Maries</hi> dayes, thou that perſecutedſt the non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conformiſts
<pb facs="tcp:52304:26"/>
afterwards, that thou wouldſt not ſuffer the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God to meet together, to ſeek him with an honeſt heart, but wouldſt confine them, to thy groſs formal wayes of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip? Though the Lord hath appeared and broken the horns of the Oppreſſors, yet the perſecuting ſpirit is not broken in thee, but thou ſtill hunteſt after the precious life of the ſeed, and wouldſt not let it ſpring up in the Nation. The ſpirit of enmity is ſtill up in thee, which knows not the Lord of life, but by a natural inſtinct oppoſeth him, and would fain keep up ſome grave or other, it cares not what, ſo it might but thereby keep down the life: for thou canſt now bear with any form, and cheriſh it: and thy onely enmity is againſt thoſe, who are ſent by the Lord, to gather out of all forms into the life. How often would the Lord have gathered thee, but thou wouldſt not! and yet ſeeks to gather thee, but ſtill thou wilt not; but as if the former laws, made in Queen <hi>Maries</hi> dayes, were not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient, deſireſt new laws to enſnare and entangle the innocent! What wil become of thee! or what wil thou ſay to the Lord, when he ariſeth to plead the cauſe of the innocent? for that Spirit, which he raiſed up to witneſs againſt the whoriſh ſpirit, (which lies hid in thy forms of worſhip and religion, &amp; appears in all thy Laws, Councils and waies of Government, ſo far as they formed, and ſo far as they are guided by the wiſdom of the fleſh) is innocent: even as that ſpirit, which witneſſed former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly againſt Popety and Epiſopacy, was innocent before the Lord, though accuſed by them as guilty of error in it ſelf, and of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbance to the publique peace, as this is now by thee.</p>

            <head>Some Principles guiding out of the Apoſtacy to the Chriſtian Spirit, and Life again.</head>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>THat there is no ſalvation but by the true knowledg of Chriſt.</hi> The Jews had received the ordinances of God, and knew of the Meſſiah to come, and believed it, and were very zealous in their worſhip, in obſervation of <hi>Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion, the Paſſeover, New moons</hi> and <hi>Sabbaths,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>(Wherewith ſhall I come before the Lord, and bow my ſelf before the high God?)</hi> and yet God complains of them by his Prophet, <hi>My people periſh for lack of knowledg.</hi> And the ſtate is the ſame un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Anti-chriſtian Apoſtacy, wherein the whore hath made <hi>all nations, kindreds, tongues</hi> and <hi>languages</hi> drunk with the cup of her fornication, the true knowledg and worſhip hath been loſt, though the eyes of them that have been in the apoſtacy, and drunk with the cup could not ſee it, no more then the Jews could in their day. But to come cloſe to the thing.</p>
            <p>The knowledge of Chriſt is not litteral, traditional, or fleſhly; nor can it be received by the natural underſtanding: but it is ſpiritual, and the underſtanding muſt be given by God which receives it. <hi>He hath given us an underſtanding, that we may know him that is true,</hi> 1 John 5. 20. A man may read Scriptures, hear Sermons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and thereby gather a knowledge into the old underſtanding: but neither this underſtanding into which the knowledge is gathered, nor the knowledge it ſelf which is gathered is ſpiritual, but fleſhly, and ſo cannot ſave. He that comes once to receive an underſtanding from Chriſt, and to have the knowledge of Chriſt powred forth from Chriſt into his heart, knowes the difference between that, and the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding into which he gathers things. The knowledge of Chriſt after the letter (and a faith in him anſwerable to ſuch know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge) will not ſave: but a man muſt know him in that ſpirit, life and power wherein he lived, if he groundedly hope to be ſaved by him, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 16. 17.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>That Chriſt ſaves by the new covenant:</hi> Not by any thing
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:52304:27"/>
got into the minde by the oldneſs of the letter, but by a life begotten which is new. There are two covenants made men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of in Scripture, one whereof is called the old, the other the new. The old belonged to the Jewes, which is done away with their ceremonies, ſtate and polity: the new, which is better then the former Chriſt is the mediator of, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 6. By mediating between God and the creature, or by bringing them together in and according to this covenant, he ſaves. Man by his diſunion and diſtance from God, he periſheth: by being brought again to God, he lives again; which thing Chriſt effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteth by the new covenant. So then, he that is not lead by Chriſt into that covenant, is not in the ſtate of ſalvation.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>That the new covenant is written in the heart,</hi> or there is no other way of coming into the new covenant, whereof Chriſt is the High-prieſt and Mediator, but by having the Laws of God written in the heart. <hi>This is the covenant,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>I will put my Laws into their minde, and write them in their hearts,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>they ſhall not teach every man his neighbour, and every man his brother, ſaying, know the Lord: for all ſhall know me, from the leaſt to the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt.</hi> Heb. 8. 10. 11. He is ſpeaking of the covenant whereof Chriſt is mediator, <hi>ver.</hi> 6. which he cals a new covenant, <hi>ver.</hi> 8. and ſaith it is not like the old <hi>ver.</hi> 9. inſtancing in two main particulars, wherein it is very unlike. 1. The old was writ out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly in letters, to be read by the outward ey: but this is writ inwardly in the heart and minde, and ſo can only be read by a ſpiritual ey. 2. Under the old they needed teaching from men, the prieſts lips were to preſerve knowledge, and they were to ſeek the law at his mouth; but now they ſhould have the law ſo neer them, ſo cleerly written in them, that they ſhould need none to teach them. From the law is the knowledge of God; the law is in the heart; and from the law in the heart ſprings up the knowledge of God in the leaſt, and in the greateſt that are within this covenant, that they need not ſay know the Lord. This is the ſtate of the new covenant, which the Chriſtians came to in thoſe dayes. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. <hi>ver.</hi> 27. but it hath been a ſtrange thing in this dark night of Apoſtacy, and is yet a ſtrange thing to many. But let ſuch conſider, can a man be a Chriſtian, and be out of that covenant, whereof Chriſt is the mediator? Can a man be brought back again to God by Chriſt, and yet
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:52304:28"/>
be out of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>that covenant whereby Chriſt brings men back to God? O how hath Satan deluded poor ſouls in this thick night of darkneſs, to make men believe they have faith in Chriſt, and ſhall be ſaved thereby; while they are quite ignorant of, and ſtrangers to that covenant, whereby Chriſt the mediat or ſaves. <hi>They ſhall all know me, from the leaſt to the greateſt.</hi> Marke, there is not the leaſt in this covenant, but hath the law ſo writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in his heart, that he need not ſeek out for knowledge.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>That the ſpirit of God alone can write the covenant in the heart,</hi> or that Chriſt writes the covenant by his ſpirit. Man by all his wiſdom cannot attain it. Man is driven out from God, and cannot finde the way back again to him, without the teachings and leadings of Gods own ſpirit. It is not the being educated in any way of Religion from ones childhood, or the leaving of that, and running into any ſect afterwards, that will avail any thing hereto; but the alone hearkening to the true voice of the true ſpirit. It is written in the Prophets concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the children of this covenant, that they ſhall be all taught of God, <hi>And all thy children ſhall be taught of the Lord.</hi> It is the Lord alone, who by his ſpirit teacheth them to come to Chriſt, and to receive the new covenant into their hearts from Chriſt: For man is in an incapacity to know or receive Chriſt or his covenant, until the ſpirit hath fitted and taught him: <hi>John</hi> 14. 17. but when he hath prepared and fitted his heart, then with his own finger he writeth the pure law of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and life of Chriſt therein, by the receit where of he cometh out of his old dark ſpirit and nature into the true knowledge of God, and union with him. <hi>I will put my ſpirit within you,</hi> Ezek. 36. 27. This is part of the covenant, and indeed that part whereby all the reſt is wrought.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>Therefore the firſt proper ſtep in Religion, is to know how to meet with Gods ſpirit.</hi> There is no progreſs (no true progreſs) to be made in the true Religion, till a man comes into the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant: and there is no coming into the covenant, but by the ſpirit: therefore the firſt thing that is abſolutely neceſſary to be known in Religion is the ſpirit, his writing, or at leaſt his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and ſtirrings in the heart. It may further be evidenced thus, all things in Religion, acceptable to God, flow from the ſpirit: All knowledge is to come from him; for he alone hath
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:52304:28"/>
revealed and can reveal truth, and is appointed by Chriſt to lead into all truth: All worſhip is to be offered up in him they that worſhip the father, muſt worſhip him in the ſpirit, and in the truth, for the father ſeeketh ſuch to worſhip him, but rejecteth all other worſhippers and worſhip, how glorious ſoever their worſhip may ſeem to them: Particularly praying is alwayes to be in the ſpirit, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6. 18. <hi>Jude</hi> 20. ſo ſinging, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yea the whole life and converſation is to be in the ſpirit, <hi>Galath.</hi> 5. 25. The mortifying of all corruption is to be done by the ſpirit, <hi>If ye through the ſpirit mortify the deeds of the body, ye ſhall live,</hi> Rom. 8. 13. Indeed a Chriſtian is nothing, and can do nothing without the power and preſence of the ſpirit of God in him. So then, if nothing in Religion can be done (with acceptance to God) without the ſpirit, then the ſpirit is the firſt thing to be looked after, by him who would be truly and well-groundedly religious.</p>
            <p n="6">6. <hi>The firſt way of meeting with the ſpirit of God, is as a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincer of ſin.</hi> (Here is the true enterance, This is the Key that opens into life eternal; He that can receive it, let him. It is not by ſoring aloſt into high imaginations and forms of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, but by coming down to this low thing.) This is the firſt and moſt proper work of the ſpirit of God toward fallen man (whereby he makes way toward the writing of Gods Law in the heart) namely to convince of ſin. And where ſhould man look firſt to meet with him, but in his firſt work upon him? When Chriſt promiſed the comforter, the ſpirit of truth, he ſaid this concerning him, that he ſhould <hi>convince the world of ſin,</hi> John 16. 8. They who are created a new in Chriſt, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come his Diſciples, receive comfort from the ſpirit: but what is he to the world? or how may they feel any operation of him? why he is to them a convincer of ſin, and they may finde him checking them for, and convincing them of their ſins. So that the great work for man, while he lies in the darkneſs (for when he is tranſlated into the light, it will be eaſy) is to know how to diſtinguiſh the movings and ſtirrings of the ſpirit of God: And this is the beſt way for man in this ſtate to know them by: That which diſcovers that which is evill, that is good: that which diſcovers that which is ſpiritually evill, that muſt needs be ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually good: for evll is darkneſs and cannot make it ſelf mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt.
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:52304:29"/>
That which diſcovers that which is undoubtedly pure, and inclines to it, that muſt needs be of God. Now to know this, and be joyned unto it, is a joyning of the creature unto God, by ſome what of him that comes from his ſpirit, and ſo is a true beginning of life eternal.</p>
            <p n="7">7. <hi>That whereby the ſpirit of God convinceth of ſin, is his light ſhining in the conſcience.</hi> Fallen man is darkneſs; The light ſhines in the darkneſs, and ſhews man the evill which otherwiſe would ly covered in him. Man fel from God, loſt the image of God, and became wholly darkneſs: but the ſpirit of God is light, and ſhines in the darkneſs, and ſtrives with man to reduce him back again to that light from which he fel. <hi>God who commanded the light to ſhine out of darkneſs, hath ſhined in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God, &amp;c.</hi> 2. Cor. 4. 6. Where did the Apoſtles, and Chriſtians in thoſe dayes, meet with the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in Chriſt? God ſhined it in their hearts. He that made the light to ſhine out of the dark deep, <hi>Geneſ.</hi> 1. 2. by his ſpirit, he by the ſame ſpirit made the light of the knowledge of life ſhine in their dark hearts: and there it is alſo that the work of conviction is wrought by the ſame ſpirit. He that perfects the good work in the heart, the ſame is he that begins it there; and his beginning is by reproving and convincing of ſin, and ſo turning the heart from it unto God, and unto the obedience of that righteouſneſs which he makes manifeſt. And he that meeteth not with the ſpirit in the beginning of his work, or ſlinketh back and goeth not on with him, but ſmothereth his reproofes, not forbearing that, or parting with that, for which he is reproved, is never like to meet with him in the end. And then it will be too late for him to blame that Religion where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in there was only a dead form, but not the living power of God. He that will come to life eternal, muſt be tranſlated out of his dead underſtanding, and all his dead wayes and worſhips (which pleaſe that underſtanding) into a living principle and keep in that principle and then he ſhall know life indeed, and the true food of that life, and the true worſhip and ſervice from that life, and the reward belonging to all.</p>
            <p n="8">8. <hi>That this light convincing of ſin, ſhineth in every conſcience. He hath ſhewed thee, O man, what is good,</hi> Micah. 6. 8. <hi>The life,</hi>
               <pb n="51" facs="tcp:52304:29"/>
which was in Chriſt, was <hi>the light of men,</hi> Joh. 1. 4. Chriſt is <hi>the light of the World,</hi> Joh. 8. 12. God as he loved the World, ſo he manifeſted his love to the World, by ſending his light into it to enlighten every man that cometh into the World, that with the light they might ſee his Son, and as many as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him, to them he gives power to become the Sons of God. As God would have <hi>all men to be ſaved, and come to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the truth:</hi> So he hath given that light to all, which may bring to the knowledge of the truth which ſaveth. He is <hi>the true light, which enlighteneth every man that cometh into the World,</hi> Joh. 1. 9. <hi>The grace of God, which bringeth ſalvation, hath appeared to all men,</hi> &amp;c. As the enemy got poſſeſſion of every mans heart, by filling it with darkneſs: ſo Chriſt purſueth, and ſeeketh to diſpoſſeſs the enemy, by the light which he ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth after him into every man. And this is the condemnation of man, not that he wants a light to witneſs againſt, and draw him from the enemy: but that he loves the enemy, and chuſeth to be one with the enemy; but hates the light and turns from it, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 10. 20. He hearkens to the reaſonings of his minde againſt the light, and ſo ſmothers and choaks it; but does not turn to the light, to have all the reaſonings and ſtrength of his minde ſubdued by it, and ſubjected to it.</p>
            <p n="9">9. <hi>The true way to life eternal, is by believing in the light of the ſpirit, which ſhineth in the conſcience.</hi> Man is in darkneſs, which keeps him in death: and there is no way to come out of the death, but by coming out of the darkneſs: and there is no way to come out of the darkneſs, but by following that light which diſcovers it, and cals forth from it: And he that doth fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low that, cannot remain in the darkneſs, but muſt needs come out. There is an evil principle in man, calling for evil; and there is a good principle, calling from the evil to the good: Now he that follows the good, cannot follow the evil, but departs from it. <hi>I am the light of the World</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>he that followeth me, ſhall not walk in darkneſs, but ſhall have the light of life,</hi> Joh. 8. 12. But this is that which undoes man, he loves the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, he loves the world, the courſe of the world the worſhips of the world; He loves his own underſtanding, and his own will, and ſo hates that light which croſſeth theſe, &amp; which teach would him (by the denial of them) to crucify that nature from
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:52304:30"/>
whence they ſpring, and to which they are ſutable<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And from hence it comes to paſs (the love to ſin within being ſtrong; and Satan, the ſtrong man, keeping the houſe) that the motions of Gods ſpirit are eaſily overborn, either by reaſonings of the underſtanding, or by perverſnes of the will: But if man durſt truſt himſelf to them he would quickly finde of what nature they were, by the ſtrong oppoſition of the ſtrong man againſt them. It is indeed a ſtrait and narrow way, into which no fleſh can enter and walk. And yet it is the only way: for there is no life in God, no peace with God while the enemy lives in the heart. But when the light is received and turned to, then the power begins to work which ſlayes the enemy in the heart; and that being done, there is no more war, but peace. Then the true peace, which paſſeth underſtanding, fills and refreſhes the heart; where as the peace which was in the ſoul before, was but the peace of the enemy, and will abide no longer then the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my is ſuffered to keep poſſeſſion quietly.</p>
            <p n="10">10. <hi>That believing in the light of the Spirit, which ſhines in the conſcience, unites the ſoul to God, and opens the ſprings of life to it.</hi> Belief in darkneſs (which is unbelief towards God) diſunited the ſoul, and cloſed up the ſprings of life from it; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief in the light, which is ſent to lead from the darkneſs, u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites again, and opens the ſprings again. God is light he dwels in the light, and there enjoyes the fulneſs of life; and he gives a meaſure of his own light to draw from the darkneſs; and he who believes and follows this, is led by it unto God from whom it came: and being come out of the darkneſs unto him, he begins again to feel the ſprings of life (the freſh ſprings of life) which are in him. He that believeth, is come to the well of ſalvation, and draws living water out of it, and drinks of the living water continually, ſo that he can thirſt no more; yea <hi>out of his belly flow rivers of living water.</hi> This is the fruit of the true faith, but this is not the fruit of the faith of the Apoſtacy, but there the ſoul remains ſtil diſunited to God, and united to the darkneſs, and drinks not of the living ſtreams, but drinks dead water: the fountain of pure life is not open to it, but the fountain of iniquity: and that blood which clenſeth, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth away the ſin, is not known. There is onely a dream of theſe things in the dark night of apoſtacy, by which dream the
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:52304:30"/>
conſcience is a little quieted for the preſent; but when the witnes awakes, and the light of the day ſhines, the ſoul (which is lean) wil find it ſelf in the hands of the enemy, in the bonds of ſin, and feel that it never new that power that could redeem it, but the ſubtil Serpent deceived it with a name in ſtead of the thing.</p>
            <p>This is the true way, the narrow way (I can, in the preſence of the living God, ſet my ſeal to the truth of it) which it hath pleaſed God to diſcover and make manifeſt again, after the long dark night of Apoſtacy. And we come not to it, by hearing or receiving of any new notions or apprehenſions of things, but by feeling that which puts an end to all creaturely notions and apprehenſions: and we grow in it, by the increaſe of that thing in us. The ſeed to which the promiſe was made, the ſeed which was before <hi>Abraham</hi> was is felt, and his day is ſeen and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyced in, and by the light thereof the darkneſs is diſcovered and the kingdom of darkneſs is aſſaulted. And as it dayly fals, in many particulars, ſo it ſhall at length fal in the general, and the Kingdoms of this world ſhal become the Kingdoms of the Lord and of his Chriſt, and ye ſhal reign upon the earth, where ſin and Antichriſt have long reigned and kept him down. And though there be a great rage and out-cry among the people and heatheniſh profeſſors, yet the decree is gone forth, and Sions King ſhal reign upon the holy hill of Sion, and the hills and mountains ſhal melt before him, and the earth ſhal ſhake round about him.</p>
            <p>Therefore gather your ſelves together, muſter up your ſtrong forces, O ye ſeveral ſorts of carnal profeſſors. Let all your dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences one againſt another fal, and joyn together againſt him, who is againſt you all: improve the Serpents wiſdom, and form arguments out of the Scripture thereby, with the utmoſt of the skil and underſtanding of fleſh; get the Kings, Rulers, and Magiſtrates of the earth on your ſide too, handle all the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons of the fleſh, skilfully; Diſpute; reproach, revile, whip, ſtock, impriſon, ſtarve, nay put to death. See if you can up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold your kingdom: for there is a mighty one come forth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt you, who will take the vineyard, the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, the inheritance from you, and give it to another; and on you ſhall come that death and darkneſs, that miſery and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:52304:31"/>
which ye have put far from you, and preached as the portion of others. Therefore conſider your condition in the fear of the Lord: and if ye feel not your ſelves able to fight it out, make your peace betimes, and let your greateſt crowns (your choiſeſt wiſdom and ſtrength in the fleſh) be laid down at the feet of Chriſt, at the loweſt appearance of his light in the conſcience. Let not the leaſt check of his ſpirit be ſpighted there, but eſteemed above the higheſt notions of light that ye have gathered in, or can gather with your fleſhly underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. And indeed it is no leſs then its due: for this which runs freſh from the Spirit, is more living in it ſelf, and more proper to that mans preſent eſtate to whom it comes, then whatever he himſelf by his underſtanding can gather from the letter.</p>
            <p>There hath been a precious ſeed of God long ſtirring in this Nation, but it hath been oppreſſed, and kept in bondage by the ſpirit of Pharoah and his wiſe Egyptians, who would ſubject it to their laws and worſhips, and not let Iſrael go out of Egypt at Gods cal, to worſhip him in ſpirit and truth, but would keep him in forms and waies of mans invention. The Lord hath poured out his plagues upon this ſpirit, and more and more wrought out the liberty of his people: but as the plagues ceaſe, this ſpirit hardens it ſelf, and aſſaies the reducing of Iſrael into bondage again. And as Pharoah renews the bondage of Iſrael, ſo God renews the plagues on Pharoah and his Egypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans. Pharoah hath a ſtubborn wil, and a great wiſdom and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, and is loth to let Iſrael go: but the Lord alſo is wiſe and ſtrong, and hath a wil more righteous then Pharoahs, and by his wiſdom and ſtrength will he effect his will, and Pharoahs ſhal not ſtand.</p>
            <p>Who is ſuch a ſtranger in Iſrael, that hath not obſerved, that as God began to raiſe up the ſeed in this Nation, and cal it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to liberty, ſo the ſpirit of the wiſe Egyptians roſe up againſt it, exclaiming of error, hereſy, blaſphemy, new waies, new lights, &amp;c? And doubtleſs many tares have ſprung up, but the aime of the enemy was not ſo much to pluck up theſe tares, as to deſtroy the one good ſeed of wheat. <hi>Herod</hi> did not aime at killing all the Infants in <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> but he would rather kill them all, then have Chriſt live. What preaching on the one
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:52304:31"/>
hand? what running to the Magiſtrate on the other hand? and all to deſtroy this young babe. When any different way of worſhip did appear, as of <hi>Independency, Anabaptiſm,</hi> or of <hi>ſeeking</hi> and <hi>waiting</hi> for the truth; how did they make an head againſt them, and cry out againſt them, for fear the young child ſhould be born and appear there? And now they ſee their own image brought forth there, they are at peace with them: and having diſcovered that, where no part of the image or mark can be received, but there is another nature in life and truth brought forth, and no form without life wil down? now they know where to ſhoot all their darts, now they know againſt whom to invent, and ſpeak all manner of evil, and againſt whom to direct all their envy, rage and out-cryes, and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſs all ſorts of perſons every where, with all manner of prejudices, that the truth may not ſpread any where, but be oppoſed every, where And all perſons minds there, are ſo filled before hand with the venome of the Serpent, that truth cannot come any where, but it finds the enmity already ſtirred up, and prepared to withſtand it.</p>
            <p>This is a new way, a new light, ſaies one: we know a Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion before this came up, and we wil keep to that, let who wil run after theſe new ſects and ways. A natural light, the old light of nature, ſaith another, or the corrupted light of <hi>Adam</hi> which hath run along through all his poſterity. Another out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cry is, that it makes the Scriptures void and uſeleſs. Others cry out that it teacheth things contrary to the Scriptures, that it ſets up free-wil, that it leads to a covenant of works, that it breaks down Relations, Laws, Governments, takes away due reſpect from Magiſtracy and Superiours, and turns the world upſide down. Thus the worldly ſpirit is every where up in arms, and a zeal kindled every where, to keep it out of every heart, and out of every place and country.</p>
            <p>Now theſe are not real things, but ſuch kind of ſlanders and reproaches, as alwaies have attended truth. The <hi>Prophets</hi> of God, <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and his <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> though they have been ſpoken wel of afterwards, yet they have ever been hated, ſpoken il of, and perſecuted by the generation of profeſſors of their age. The <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees</hi> could not with ſo great advantage have perſecuted Chriſt and his Apoſtles, without a ſeeming zeal
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:52304:32"/>
for the Law and Prophets: and yet it was the ſame ſpirit that ſo vehemently cryed up <hi>the Law, the Prophets, the Ordinances of Moſes,</hi> that perſecuted the ſpirit and life in Chriſt and his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, from whence the Law, the Prophets, and Ordinances came. And thus it is at this day, though that Spirit is as blind now as it was then, and cannot ſee through its own cover, though it be as weak and narrow as theirs was. The guilty chargeth the innocent, that it might hide its own guilt, and keep its covering. The guilty <hi>Jewes,</hi> and the guilty <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees,</hi> charged the <hi>Prophets, Chriſt</hi> and his <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> that they might not be found guilty by them, and their formal co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering rent from them. And thus it is at this day, Truth is riſen to make manifeſt mens falſe coverings, and the guilt and hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſy that lies hid underneath: now to ſave themſelves, they are prepared before hand to lay that charge againſt truth, which truth hath againſt them.</p>
            <p>Search thine heart, reſiſt not the light, thou that haſte charged the truth with any of theſe things, and thou wilt find it thine own condition, The truth is no new light, or new way; and they that hold it forth, do not hold forth any new way, or new light: but it is thou that haſt left the good old light, the good old way which was before the apoſtacy, and haſt fallen in with ſome new light, ſome new way invented and ſet up ſince the Apoſtacy. It is thou again that ſetteſt up the natural light, the fallen wiſdom, the wiſdom which is out of the life, and in en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity with the life; with this thou feedeſt that underſtanding which is to be brought to naught: and when thou haſt done this thy ſelfe, then thou calleſt the ſpiritual light, wherewith God hath purſued it in all ages, a natural light. It is thou, that with this wiſdom ſearching into the Scriptures, and gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the oldneſs of the letter into the old underſtanding, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keſt the Scriptures void and uſeleſs to thy ſoul, and canſt not meet with that life and power which they ſpeak of, but ſtil art alive in thy ſins, and dead unto God: and then thou cryeſt out againſt that which comes to diſcover this to thee, and to bring thee out of this dead knowledg into the life of the Scriptures, thou cryeſt out againſt this, as if this made the Scriptures uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs. And when thou haſt ſet up an whole body of knowledge, religion, and worſhip quite contrary to the Scriptures, which
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:52304:32"/>
the truth comes to make manifeſt, then <hi>Cains</hi> nature riſeth up in thee, and thou takeſt up <hi>Cains</hi> weapons, and fain wouldeſt thou kill thy brother, becauſe his ſacrifice in the faith teſtifies againſt thine, which is out of the faith, and contrary to the true teſtimony of the Scriptures. Again, for free-wil and a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of works, Thou haſt ſet up a religion in the old will, and works, not according to the new Covenant of life, but accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the old Covenant of death: and by this thou preacheſt that wil to be free, which is in bonds, and ſetteſt up the works of mans righteouſneſs and conformity to the letter, for the works of the new Covenant. And for Governments and Laws, That which is according to God, which is a terror to the evil, and a praiſe to them that do wel, that which is liberty to the juſt, and a curb to the unjuſt; this thou art againſt, and cryeſt out daily for the turning of the Magiſtrates Sword againſt the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent, becauſe they are a light to diſcover thy deeds of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs (which be out of the light) and diſturb thy peace and thy ſettlement in that which is fleſhly, and of man, and not of God. So for relations, and honour to Magiſtrates, The tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſing nature hath brought up a wrong thing, a fleſhly thing, an honour, a duty which is of the fleſh, and pleaſeth the fleſh, and is not according to God. And this is not honour indeed, not an honour that wil ſtand, not an honour that will be juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in the ſight of God, but is a ſhame to them that give it, and a ſhame to them that receive it, diſcovering that they are ſervants to the fleſh, giving to and receiving from the fleſhly part, that which the fleſhly part (which crucifies the life) cals for, and is pleaſed with.</p>
            <p>All that the light doth to theſe things, is to diſcover and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn them: and the end of its diſcovery is that they might be removed, and truth and righteouſneſs brought in the ſtead of them. But mans evil heart, which is the cauſe of them, cries out againſt the light, as if the light brought them; whereas if man could but be quiet and ſtil, and ſuffer the work of the light up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, he would find that the ſame light which diſcovereth them, would alſo purge them away, and leave neither root nor branch of iniquity either in mens hearts, or in relations, or fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, or towns, or cities, or laws, or governments; and there
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:52304:33"/>
would be no want of honour. Now though the Serpents wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom is irreconcilable, &amp; that underſtanding which ſtands there cannot be ſatisfied, but muſt be confounded and brought to nought, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 19. yet becauſe underneath all this, there is a ſimplicity in ſome which is betrayed; for the relief of that, ſomewhat further may be ſpoken in anſwer to theſe things.</p>

               <hi>Object.</hi> 1. To the firſt Objection that this is a new way, or new light, I anſwer.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is new indeed to them who have lain long in the Apoſtacy, and ſet up another light, but it is not new in it ſelf, but the ſame that was in the beginning, yea and before the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning alſo. Chriſt was the ſame yeſterday, to day, and for ever<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the light that comes from him is like him, that alſo is the ſame yeſterday, to day, and for ever. It was the ſame un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the law, the ſame before the law, the ſame ſince the lavv. As the darkneſs all along hath been the ſame: ſo the light all along hath been the ſame alſo. It vvas the ſame in the <hi>Jews,</hi> and the ſame in the <hi>Gentiles.</hi> It vvas this God expected obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to from the <hi>Jews,</hi> and the Prophet (in the name of the Lord) diſdains their ſacrifices, and brings them to this, <hi>Micah</hi> 6. 8. <hi>He hath ſhewed thee, O man, what is good; and what doth the Lord require of thee, but to do juſtly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God?</hi> Their eye vvas upon ſacrifices and oyl; the prophet points them to that vvhich vvould bring them to the right ſacrifice, and to the true oyl. And the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,</hi> ſo far as they vvere obedient to this, vvere accepted, and excuſed in their ovvn conſciences, the faithful vvitneſs vvhere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is of God, and vvil ſtand in the day of Chriſt, <hi>Ro.</hi> 2. 15. 16. <hi>That which was from the beginning,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle <hi>John, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare we unto you,</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 1. And <hi>this is the meſſage which we have heard of him, and declare unto you, that God is light, and in him is no darkneſs at al,</hi> ver. 5. And the end of preaching this meſſage, is to dravv out of the darkneſs into the light: to bring men to the feeling of the light of God in them, and ſo to uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on vvith it; vvhich being turned to, dravvs out of the darkneſs. God vvho is light, is nigh to every man, vvho is darkneſs, though mans ſenſe is very thick, and can hardly ſee or feel him: and a
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:52304:33"/>
light from him ſhines in mans darkneſs, but mans darkneſs comprehends it not. So that this light is not nevv in it ſelf, but onely nevv to the old Spirit, vvhich hath long lain hid in the region of darkneſs and death, &amp; hath not known the light of life.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> 2. That this is a natural light, or the light of old <hi>Adams</hi> nature.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is in one ſenſe a natural light, it is of the nature of him from whom it comes, of the nature of God and of his Chriſt, whom it appears for: but it is not of the nature of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt <hi>Adam,</hi> whom it always reproved, and againſt whom it ſtil ſtands a witneſs, and condemns all corruption. Man is darkneſs, and when Chriſt comes to redeem him, he finds him darkneſs: and Chriſt finds no light in him to help him to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover ſin to him, but all the diſoveries of ſin that are made in the heart, are by the light of Chriſt, and not by any light of mans nature. The Lord is the ſearcher of the heart, and he ſearcheth it with his own candle, and not with any left in mans nature. Man fel into darkneſs, &amp; knew not wher he was, but the Lord cometh after him with his candle, &amp; diſcovereth his ſtate to him. It is the light from which man fel, and againſt which he ſins, that is alone able to make his diſobedience manifeſt to him. <hi>We know,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>that the law is ſpiritual, but I an carnal,</hi> Rom. 7. 14. The law is the loweſt part of the light, and yet that is ſpiritual, and of Chriſts nature, and not of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dams</hi> nature; <hi>we know</hi> it, ſaith the Apoſtle. Such as know the nature of that which manifeſts ſin, know it to be ſpiritual. It is the fallen man from the light, the man in the darkneſs, that cals the light darkneſs: but that which diſcovers the darkneſs, and reproves the darkneſs, and warrs againſt the darkneſs, is not darkneſs, but the light of life. And thoſe who are ſpiritual, and feel the nature and power of it in their ſpirits, know it to be ſo. But man hath ſet up a light of his own, hath raiſed up a light by his ſtudy and invention, in the ſtrength of the fallen wiſdom: and now ſetting up this for light, he muſt needs call the true light darkneſs, as the Phariſees did Chriſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> 3. That it makes the Scriptures void and uſeleſs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> It came from the ſpirit that gave forth the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, it is of the ſame nature with the light that ſhone in them that gave forth Scriptures, it ſpeaks the ſame thing with
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:52304:34"/>
Scriptures, it leads to the ſame thing, and it opens witneſſes to the words which the Scriptures ſpeak; and ſo it brings the Scriptures, which have been long abuſed, into their true uſe. Indeed it puts an end to the corrupt uſe of Scriptures, to mans inventing and forming things out of them, but brings them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their true uſe and ſervice. It takes the Scriptures out of mans hand, who hath ſlain the life by them, and puts them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the hands of the ſpirit, who makes the words again pure, and quick, and living, purging away mans defiled and dead conceivings and interpretations of them.</p>
            <p>A man muſt know the Spirit, come to the ſpirit, be joyned to and be in union with the Spirit, before he can have the true underſtanding of the Scriptures. The Scriptures of truth are the words of God, or various expreſſions of his mind, which he that ſearcheth into, afore he hath his ſpirit, cannot know: and ſo man in this ſtate can onely gueſs and imagine at things, but cannot ſee the truth. And from hence it is, that ſo many ſects and heaps are ſprung up in the world, according to the variety of their imaginations. One ſort of men cry this is the way, this is the truth, this is the Church, this is the worſhip: Another ſort cry that is not it, that is ſuperſtition and error, but this is it: and ſo a third, and fourth &amp;c. So about Scriptures, one ſaith this is the meaning; another ſaith it is not ſo, but this is the meaning. The Papiſts ſay the Church muſt judge of the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Scriptures; and the Proteſtants who take more ſcope, how do they doubt, and differ, and oppoſe one another about the interpretation of Scriptures? which plainly ſhowes, that they do not plow with the right heifer, for then there would be unity and certainty. They let their own reaſonings and imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations looſe, and there is no foundation of certainty: but had they waited for the Spirit to begin with, and gone on no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then he opened to them, all theſe doubts and diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions would have been choked in the birth, or womb, or not have come ſo far as either birth or womb. Yet do I not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether deny the reading of Scriptures, even in this ſtate, if men read with fear and trembling, not ſetting up his own un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, or the underſtanding of any man elſe, but wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the ſpirit, which can alone give him an underſtanding
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:52304:34"/>
to receive the true knowledg. But this I dare boldly affirm, that mens reading of the Scriptures in their own wiſdom and ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>confidence (or confidence of what interpretation others have given) doth them no good at all, but much harm, tending to the building up of that which God will again deſtroy. But he that begins with the ſpirit of God, giving himſelf up to that light which comes from him, comes to true union with God, and to the feeling of his life, and ſo to a true growth, and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of the ſpirit of God, whereby he comes to know and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the Scriptures which came from the ſame ſpirit; and hereby alſo he comes to be able to meaſure the deceit of his own Spirit, which formerly led him aſide, and alſo to ſee and meaſure the ſpirits of deceivers. But he that is in the deceit, in the imagination, out of the true knowledg; he cannot know the deceit of his own ſpirit, or the ſpirits of deceivers, but cals the truth deceit, and the deceit truth.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> That light, which comes from the ſame ſpirit which the Scriptures came from, cannot teach things contrary to the Scriptures. But man, who hath took the tools of his under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, and formed images and likeneſſes out of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, (I mean invented meanings and ſenſes) and judged theſe agreeable to the Scriptures: he muſt needs judge that which is contrary to theſe, as contrary to the Scriptures: whereas the truth is one in it ſelf, and agreeth with whatſoever is true in this age, or in former ages; and differs onely from that which is not true. And we know that there is that true unity with that ſpirit from which the Scriptures came, and with the Scriptures, and with one another in that light which the wiſdom of man cannot but deſpiſe, as hath not been in any age ſince the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacy til now.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> 5. That this ſets up free-wil. When perſons are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted to embrace the light, to let in the light, and told that condemnation comes for not believing or receiving the light: then they cry out, can man believe? can man receive the light? hath man free-wil?</p>
            <p>The wil of man is bound; but there is liberty, power, and
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:52304:35"/>
freedom in the light which viſits man, and comes to unbind and ſave him. And man feels this power, taſts of this liberty, feels ſomewhat diſengaging him from the evil, and drawing him from it: but he, being in love with the evil, draws back from the drawing, ſhutting his ears againſt the wiſdom of the light, and opening his ears to the reaſonings of the Serpent; and then the liberty and power, which was in the light, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draws with the light, and the bonds are ſtrengthned upon him; And this is the condemnation, not that there was a want of power from God, but that he choſe the power of the enemy, not loving the light, wherein the power of life lay. God knows the ſtate of man in the fall, and knows the ſtrength of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my; and the Saviour that he ſends hath ſufficient power againſt him, and the light that the Saviour ſends is ſtronger then the darkneſs, and can overcome the darkneſs, and cannot be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come by the darkneſs; And if thou joyn with the darkneſs, and wilt not yeeld to the drawings of the father, but yeeld up thy ſelf to the drawings and reaſonings of the darkneſs; yet the ſtrength of the light remains in it ſelf: and though for the preſent, thou haſt ſtruck it down and ſlain it, yet it will riſe up a ſtrong and living witneſs againſt thee, and the darkneſs to which thou haſt joyned. When a man goes from the light, he goes into the wil, voluntarily; then take and chooſe in the fleſh. When a man follows the light, the will of the fleſh dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in him, another wil riſeth up and chooſeth for him, there is the true liberty.</p>
            <p>But as for your ſpeaking of free-wil, ye do not know what ye ſpeak of: for the will, (with the freedom of it) either ſtands in the image and power of him that made it, or in a contrary image and power. While it is in the image and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of him that made it, it is free unto good, and not to evil: while it is in the image and power of him who corrupted it, it is free unto evil, and not to good. The wil is not of it ſelf, but ſtands in another, and is ſervant to that in whom it ſtands, and there its freedom is bounded and comprehended. For there is no middle ſtate between both, wherein the wil ſtands of it ſelf, and is free to both equally; but it is a ſervant, and under the command of one of theſe powers.

            <p>And this may anſwer another objection, which lies as a great block in the way of many, who feel a conviction, but are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held from obedience, under a pretence of wanting power: whereas the power lies in that light which convinceth, and is received in the obedience, and in the croſs. As the power of the enemy crept in, in hearkning to him: So the power of truth is received in hearkning to, and receiving the reproofs of truth. That which checks the evil, that which ſtands againſt the minde, ſmiting it in its courſe of vanity and pleaſure in the fallen ſtate; in that is the power. That comes from the power, goes forth in the power, and the power is in it, and cannot be ſevered from it. So he that lets that in, lets in the power; and he that ſhuts that out, ſhuts out the power. And in this ſtate, a man may complain all his dayes for want of power, and not meet with it: for how can he, when he refuſes it in the way wherein the power ſeeks him, and waits for it in a way wherein it is not to be found? The appearance of the power at firſt is ſmal, and contemptible to the eye of the fleſhly wiſdom; and it is not received in any ſuch great overpowring way (though that alſo is known afterward) as man is apt to expect; but all lies in one little ſeed, where the day of ſmal things is known: The light, the life, the power, the purity, the wiſdom, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> lies hid there: and in receiving that little thing, all is received: and in the groweth of that, all grows up. But by being tempted by the enemy to neglect this, and wait for ſome great power and appearance of God, the ſoul is held in the bonds of iniquity, and kept from the life as ſtrongly, as by the groſſeſt form.</p>

<pb n="64" facs="tcp:52304:36"/>
The Apoſtle was alive in his worſhip and Jewiſh ſtate, till the Law came: but when the Law came, it flew that life that he had there, and he became dead, both to that life by which he lived before, and to the Law that flew him, and then there aroſe up a life in him which anſwered the Law, and could fulfil it, and lead to a righteouſneſs beyond it and then his life and his righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs were not any works of the Law, but of faith, and in the faith, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 19, 20. But yet there is no paſſing to this; but through the adminiſtration of the Law in the heart, in the hand of the Mediatour. And when the life is riſen and received, yet even then there is no peace but in obedience to the life. The peace lies in that which brings the peace; and if there be a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting from that, there is a departing from the peace. Any fleſhly thought, any fleſhly motion, as it is out of the life, ſo it is out of the peace; and the minde joyning to it, feels the death and trouble of it. Thus ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 15, 16. <hi>Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther circumciſion nor uncircumciſion availeth, but a new creature: and as many as walk according to this rule, peace be on them.</hi> The peace comes to the new creature, and to man walking accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the rule of the new creature: and the condemnation is not to them, that walk not after the fleſh, but after the ſpirit, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 1. but if there be an hearkning to the fleſh, and a fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the unrighteouſneſs thereof in any thing, God is righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and he cannot ſpeak peace to the wicked, or to him that joyns with the wicked. Therefore where there is true peace, there muſt be a coming from the wicked nature, and a living out of the wicked nature in him who is the life, the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, the peace. I know there have been curious fabricks in mens minds about the covenant of grace, but they have not known the nature of it, and of the works that flow from it, and ſo are apt to call the works of the new life, ſpringing from the covenant of life, the works of the old covenant. But wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom is juſtified of her Children, and they know her birth; and in the true light the true nature of things is ſeen, and the true name and deſcription given, which he that is out of the light cannot receive, but ſtumbles at: and the wiſer he is, in his own deviſed way and knowledge of things, the more ſtumbling blocks he has, and the more he ſtumbles.</p>

               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Iniquity hath reigned, unrighteouſneſs hath winded it ſelf into, and twiſted about every thing. And now the truth comes to diſcover and purg out the iniquity, the ſtrong man, who hither to hath kept poſſeſſion of the houſe, cries out as if the deſtruction of the thing were aimed at. Nay, it is onely the evil that is aimed at, but the thing it ſelf is not to be deſtroyed, but to be ſet free from the evil, and preſerved. Relations are good, Laws are good, Governments are good, of God; but the unrighteouſneſs of fleſh, the pleaſing of the fleſh by the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of theſe, the giving liberty to the unjuſt, this is not good. And is it not in relations, in Governments, in the execution of Laws? If a man will be fleſhly, and walk in them according to the fleſh, the Law takes not hold of him, his relations are not offended at him: but if he come once to feel the power of God, and withdraw from the evil, and ſtand a witneſſe for God againſt it; then relations, and powers of the earth, and Laws, all ſtrike at him: and the reaſon is, becauſe they are in union with the evil, and ſo cannot bear the rending of the evil from the thing. And from hence it is, that wherever the Goſpel comes in power, it kindles a flame round about, ſetting father againſt ſon and ſon againſt father, husband againſt wife and wife againſt husband, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yea it goes cloſer then ſo, it ſets one part in man againſt another: and the fight is very bitter and ſharp, till one of theſe be ſubdued, and then there is peace: fleſhly peace, if the wiſe fleſhly part prevail, ſpiritual peace, if the weak fooliſh thing (to the World) in the heart, which is of God, prevaile.</p>
            <p>And for honour to Magiſtrates and Superiours, it is not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied: but fleſhly honour, corrupt honour, honour from the fleſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly part, and to the fleſhly part, this cannot but be denied by them which are of God. That which is born of God is not of this World, nor can it give honour to that which is of this World: but it honours all men in the Lord. What ever is of God in Magiſtracy it honours, what ever is in ſuperiority accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to God (as a father, an husband, a maſter is) it honours with true honour. Chriſt, the onely begotten of God, could not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:52304:37"/>
honour of man, nor could he give honour to man: and he ſaith to the <hi>Jews</hi> how can ye believe which receive honour one another, and ſeek not the honour that cometh from God onely? The receiving of honour from man, cannot ſtand with the true faith (when ye know the faith, ye will know it.) He that repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteth perſons, committeth ſin; and is a tranſgreſſor againſt the Law of faith, which leads to the life which ſtands in God, out of the Worlds honours, worſhips, cuſtomes, and whatever elſe which is not of faith, but of the World. <hi>Mordecai</hi> did not bow to <hi>Haman,</hi> nay he ſate in the Kings gate, where <hi>Haman</hi> was to paſſe, and yet did not ſtand up, move, or bow to him: what an affront was this to that high, proud, lofty ſpirit? and yet it was of the Lord. This was a type (as the Jewiſh ſtate in general was typical) of what God would do in the World, and is now doing. The Lord hath raiſed up Mordecais nature, and he hath diſcovered <hi>Hamans</hi> nature, and hath given the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand to <hi>Mordecai,</hi> that he ſhall not bow to <hi>Haman.</hi> And if ye could ſearch your hearts, ye would finde, that it is not that of God in you, which is offended for want of that which ye call honour, but the Hamaniſh ſpirit, the fleſhly pride and lofti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, which the Lord will lay low, and he alone will be exalted in this day of his mighty power, and man ſhall only be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured as he comes from him, and as he is found in him: but the honour which the fleſhly part hath ſought, and gained in the tranſgreſſion, ſhall fall with the tranſgreſſor, whom the Lord hath furbiſhed his ſword to ſmite.</p>
            <p>And for turning the World upſide down, it is acknowledged: the power of the Lord is come forth to do it. That which is high, that which is wiſe, that which is ſtrong, that which is rich, that which is full; that which is fat; the Lord will lay low, make fooliſh, weak, poor, empty, Lean; for it lies in wickedneſs. He will feed the fat and ſtrong cattle with that judgment, which ſhall make them lean and weak. And the humble, the fooliſh, the weak, the poor, the empty, the lean he will raiſe up, and make wiſe, and ſtrong, and rich, and full, and fat with the true honour, the true wiſdom, the true ſtrength, the true riches, the ſure and living mercies of <hi>David,</hi> who ſets his feet on top of the high places of the earth, of whom Chriſt came according to the fleſh.</p>

Thus I have in plainnes of heart, and with plainnes of ſpeech, ſet the truth and the error before you, and lent my hand toward the removing of ſome blocks which lay in your way, in love and pitty to your ſouls. Now if any, in the reading of this, feel a ſecret touch upon their hearts, ſtartling them, and giving ſome teſtimony to the truth, though very ſmal, and through a thick dark covering: there is that to which I ſpeak, there is my wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs within the vail, and there is the teſtimony riſing up which leads to life, if given heed to. Keep to this, and this will prick and wound, judge and condemn the contrary nature, though never ſo ſtrong.

For the falſe prophet will riſe up in thee, and fill thee with reaſonings, and perhaps multitudes of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes and comforts from Scripture, skinning over the wound, and crying peace, peace, when there is no peace. And when thou haſt thus got over the trouble, then the falſe prophet, which brought thee this peace, will ſtir thee up againſt the wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, exalting the wiſdom and reaſonings of the fleſh, and making merry with thee over the witneſs, which witneſſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thee and him, and over the trouble which came thereby: and this wil bring thee to that hardneſs of heart, which is for deſtruction. And then, when thou haſt ſlain the witneſs in thy ſelf, and exalted thy fleſhly reaſon and underſtanding over it, then the falſe prophet which ſeduced thee, will kindle a zeal in thee againſt the witneſs in others, and thou wilt prove a perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutor of the life under the name of deceit, error, hereſy and blaſphemy, whereas thou thy ſelf art fallen into the deceit, into the error from the life, and into the blaſphemy againſt it, and art in <hi>Cains</hi> nature, and wouldſt fain be handling of <hi>Cains</hi> weapons to deſtroy it.</p>
            <p>Therefore take heed of the fleſhly wiſdom, take heed of thine own underſtanding, take heed of thy reaſoning or diſput<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, for theſe are the weapons where with the witneſs is ſlain. That wiſdom muſt be deſtroyed, and that underſtanding brought to nought, and thou become a child, and learn as a child, if ever thou know the things of God. <hi>Where is the wiſe? where is the Scribe? where is the Diſputer of this World?</hi> did they ever

Nay, that wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom is curſed; it is of the earth, and fixeth in the earth, and is the grand enemy to the wiſdom that is from above.

For it is eaſier to empty them of their profanenes, then it is to empty theſe of their ſetled conceited Religion and devotion: and yet this with their Religion and devotion cannot enter, no more then the other with their profanenes.

For the Scriptures were not given for men to gather the meanings out of, and lay a foundation of faith there, by their own wils: but to diſcover and teſtifie of the foundation. And he that comes thither, &amp; is built there, knows the truth, not becauſe the Scriptures ſay ſo, but becauſe he feels the thing, is founded upon the thing, grows up in the thing, and the thing in him whereof the Scripture ſpeaks. And this know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge ſhall abide, and this faith, and this righteouſneſs, and this holineſs, and this redemption; whereas the other is but a name, put upon that which is not the thing.</p>
            <p>Theſe are precious &amp; faithful words (though through a Veſſel weakned, and weak beyond meaſure) and happy is he that hath an ear to hear them: but woe from the Lord to that eye that is cloſed, to that ear that is ſhut, to that heart that is hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, in the inventions and imaginations of mans fleſhly mind, againſt the truth of God.

            <p>The Lord is now gentle and tender, purſuing thee with his love, and following thee up and dovvn with his light; and though thou run from him into ſin and tranſgreſſion, and hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to the wiſdom of the fleſh, yet his voice comes after thee to reclaim thee: and if thou wilt hear, and but yeeld thy ſelf to him, he vvil not put thee to do any thing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but ſubdue all thy enemies for thee; yea he vvil ſlay the ſerpentine vviſdom in thee, vvith all its inventions, and daſh all ſhe children of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon againſt the ſtones, vvithout pitty to them, though vvith great pitty to thee. But if thou refuſe, and chooſe the pleaſure of the fleſh, and the groſs fleſh-pots of Egypt, and turn thine ear from his voice, giving vvay to the reaſonings of the fleſh, and keeping dovvn the vvitneſs; that day of vvrath and ſeveri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, vvhich all the Scriptures have ſpoke of vvil come, and thou vvilt have thy portion vvith hypocrites, vvho in all ages have co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered themſelves vvith a form of religion, pleaſing to the fleſh and the vvorld, but have vvith-held their hearts from the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vver of life, therefore prize the love of God to thee in giving thee this warning, and be not uncircumciſed in heart and ears, as this generation of profeſſors have alvvaies been: but let Chriſt reign in the heart, and let him trample all mans invented forms of knovvledg and vvorſhip under his feet; and give up thy ſelf to be led by him, into the true knovvledg and vvorſhip, in the ſpirit and in the truth.</p>
            <p>And now you, who find your hearts touched and convinced of the truth, and find any deſire kindled in you after the living God, and an hungring and thirſting after his righteouſneſs: Take notice of theſe three things, which I have upon my heart to ſay to you, by way of advice.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Know and take up thy croſs,</hi> the Croſs of Chriſt, the daily Croſs of Chriſt. The Croſs of Chriſt is that which croſſeth the natural, and this is the power of God to deliver from the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural. How ſhould the earthly underſtanding, the earthly wil,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:52304:39"/>
the earthly affections, with the elementary nature (which have had their ſwinge in the earth) be crucified and ſlain, but by the croſs of Chriſt? he therefore that wil have a Religion to pleaſe himſelf in any thing, muſt not come hither: and he who after he is come hither, admitteth of any thing pleaſing to the earthly, and ſtarteth from the croſs, which would deny and turn from it; ſo far as it doth ſo, he goeth backward and not forward. It is no wonder that there is ſuch an enmity in all ſorts againſt the truth, for it ſtriketh at their life, yea at the very root of their life. If there were any new way or form of Religion held forth, mens underſtandings and affections might by degrees be wrought of to it, and find pleaſure in it: but this is direct death to that nature and ſpirit that hath lived in any form of Religion, and to the whole courſe of that nature and ſpirit: yet through this death the true life ſprings up, in thoſe who receive the ſtrokes of it. Therefore be willing and learn to die dayly, and bring every thing which is contrary to Chriſt, to the Croſs. Deny ſelf in every thing, take up the Croſs in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thing, follow Chriſt in every thing, This is the way which Chriſt himſelf preſcribes to become his diſciples by. <hi>If any man wil come after me, let him deny himſelf, take up his Croſs daily, and follow me,</hi> ſeek not eaſe in the fleſh, no not in the leaſt, but take up the Croſs every day, in every thing, till the earthly be ſlain, til the wiſdom and ſtrength of the fleſh be wholly ſubdued, and then the wiſdom and power of God will become natural.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Keep to the ſence,</hi> keep to the feeling: beware of the underſtanding, beware of the imagining, conceiving mind: Theſe cannot be for God, not bring forth any thing for God, until they be new caſt and new moulded. The one ſeed of life lies in the inviſible, in the hidden man of the heart, among multitudes of ſeeds of death, all which have their growth up in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, and ſtrength in the corrupted natural. So that this ſeed cannot ſhoot up into any part of the natural, but the other ſeeds ſhoot up with it, and endeavour to choak it. Now the other ſeeds ſpring up two wayes? either in a way of oppoſition againſt the the true ſeed, or in a way of ſimilitude. There can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not a good thought, or deſire, or beam of light enter into the
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:52304:39"/>
underſtanding or will, but multitudes of evil thoughts, evil de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, or fleſhly reaſonings againſt it wil ſpring up with it, and ſtrives to over bear it. And if the enemy be at length over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, by the power of God fighting with him and vanquiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him, then he hath his garments of light, then he brings in thoughts, and deſires, and motions like Gods, which eaſily paſs for good, if the ſoul keep not cloſe upon the watch. The forward underſtanding is apt preſently to own them, and the forward will to embrace, and the forward affections to let themſelves forth into them, until the ſoul come to feel a loſs in life, and miſs the power and preſence of God, and find the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy ſtrong again. Yea the enemy hath yet a more ſubtil way, namely, to raiſe motions like the motions of Gods ſpirit, and ſuddainly, before the light hath given the diſcerning of them to raiſe oppoſition and reaſonings againſt them; that ſo by the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, which is manifeſtly evil, the motion it ſelf, which is alſo evil, (though good in appearance) might be the leſs ſuſpected and ſwallowed. Now the onely way of ſafety is to keep out of the natural, whereof the enemy hath poſſeſſion, and where his ſtrength lies, and to keep in the ſence and feeling of the invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible ſeed? and onely to come forth with him into the natural, in that ſence and feeling. And when he comes, he wil come with ſtrength, above the ſtrength that the enemy hath in the natural, and by degrees conquer him. But by no means reſt or abide in the natural, but retire with the Lord (who will not dwel there, until it be clenſed) into the reſting place. Theſe words may be hard to you at preſent, but hereafter (as you come into the exerciſe) you will feel them. And this is the reaſon, why the formal and outward part of Religion doth ſo commonly eat out the life, becauſe things there are ſutable to, and exerciſe that part wherein the ſtrength of the enemy lies: and there can never be perfect freedom and ſafety, until that part be ſubdued, and all that belongs to that part removed. The Lord is riſen to ſhake what may be ſhaken, that the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom which cannot be ſhaken may appear: and happy are they, who are ſhaken by his hand in all that is outward, and eſtabliſhed in the inward life, power, and reſt, which remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth for ever and cannot be ſhaken.</p>

3. <hi>Wait patiently the Lords leaſure.</hi> Be not haſty after life and ſalvation in the wil of the fleſh, but leave the Lord to chuſe his own ſeaſon, for the ſhowring down of his mercy and bleſſing. The Lord will not preſently entertain that ſpirit, which hath adulterated from him (proſtituting it ſelf to ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, and defiling it ſelf) into his boſom: but there muſt be a time of ſorrow, a time of purifying and clenſing. The ſoul muſt know and feel, that it hath been an evil thing and bitter, that it hath forſaken the Lord, the living fountain of living mercies, and hath ſought life from vanities, and among dead Idols. And all the Idols muſt be thrown away, and the heart waſhed from that nature that ran after them, and become a pure virgin, to bear and bring forth the living ſeed; and by faithfulneſs to that ſeed, and waiting in that ſeed, in the Lords ſeaſon it ſhall receive the mercy, and the bleſſing, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance which belongs to that ſeed. The Husbandman doth not preſently reap, but waits long, even till the ſeed be grown up to maturity. <hi>Jacob,</hi> the type of the ſeed, ſaid, <hi>O Lord, I have waited for thy ſalvation.</hi> It is the election that obtains: it is to the ſeed, and for the ſeeds ſake that the mercy is beſtowed: and there muſt be a waiting, till the ſeed be gown up to age, and able to defend his portion from his elder Brother, who o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe would be ready to ſeize on it, and waſte it upon har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lots again. Therefore lie ſtil, and bear the indignation of the Lord againſt that which hath tranſgreſſed, til he judg it, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver from it, and lead into the innocency and righteouſneſs: and then he wil find a time to ariſe, and plead the cauſe of the innocent, and give the crown of immortal life to that which he hath prepared for it. Therefore think not the race long, nor the battel hard, nor be weary of the afflictions and chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in the way: but follow the Captain, the guid, the lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, whoſe light, ſtrength, courage, and wiſdom wil overcome all, and bring the ſoul, which abides in it, into his own throne.</p>
            <p>Now as you thus wait, taking up the Croſs, and keeping in the feeling; ſo the corrupt natural, the mortal, wherein Satans throne and power hath been, wil wither, decay, and grow weak daily; and the tender plant of God, the immortal ſeed will

ſhoot up, and gather ſtrength daily: and you will come to a will in God, and an underſtanding in God, and that which is of God wil manifeſt it ſelf, and you wil come to know, and deſire, and take delight in the things of God: Then the ſoul, which is immortal, wil come to hear, and receive, and feed on the immortal word, which is the bread of life, and which alone is able to preſerve and nouriſh up to eternal life. Then ye wil know what it is to tremble at this word, and to have all the powers of nature melt and fail before it. Then ye will know the faith which gives the victory, and the knowledg which lets into life, and the fear which keeps the hearts clean, and the hope which anchors the ſoul immortal in the immortal God, and the patience which wins the Crown. And ſo ye wil come to witneſs the ſeveral conditions of the Saints in Scripture, at ye grow up into them, &amp; wil not need men to give you mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of Scriptures, from their brain-ſtudies and acquired arts and underſtandings, but wil know the meaning from the thing felt in your own hearts, and hear the words from the living voice of that ſpirit that firſt ſpake them, who alone is able to interpret his own mind, and open the words which he himſelf ſpake. And then ye wil know and love life, and need, no more exhortations to depart from all dead, corrupted, and corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting forms, which ever were, and ever wil be enemies to, and be traytors of the life. And to the peace of God, the reſt of God, the true Sabbath of God, the everlaſting light and life of God wil come to be your own, and enjoyed by you, paſt all gain-ſaying or diſpute in you, while the natural underſtanding in others is reaſoning, contending, and diſputing about them, but can never know (while they are from the thing within?) for that mind is not the heir, nor muſt not inherit the kingdom of God.</p>

               <hi>TO thoſe who have had a ſeriouſneſs and depth in their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, who could not ſit down in empty forms and ſhadows of things, but have been preſſing after the living ſubſtance, and miſſing of that, through error of judgment, the true eye be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not fixed in the head, have come to a loſs; and ſo are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to, overgrown with, and hardned in the old nature, and have taken up a pittiful reſt and centre in the earth, having let fal the purſuit of their ſpirits after the true center of reſt in the life: a word to ſuch from the love in the life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There was a ſpirit, ſoul, or image of God brought forth, and ſtanding in his life before the fall.</p>
            <p>This ſoul was brought into death, under the burthen and bondage of corruption, out of its proper centre and reſting place, by the fal.</p>
            <p>Now as there is in this ſtate a true loſs, ſo there is in this ſpirit a ſenſibleneſs, a groaning under the burthen, a feeling the bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſs of the captivity, and a panting after redemption and reſtoration to its former ſtate.</p>
            <p>Now though the whoriſh part, which ſeduced from the life, make a great noiſe in the fleſh about Saints words, and tempt to pleaſures of the outward part, and pleaſures in the mind, and draw into forms and religious worſhips, and frame deep centres of ſatisfaction in the underſtanding (perhaps from true openings of the life, quenching it) and ſo ſeek to quiet the ſoul, and ſtil the cry: yet the loſt ſtate remaining, the ſoul be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not truely redeemed, but a falſe reſt taken up by the way, in the falſe part; this wil fail, and the ſenſe be again renewed in the day of tryal and ſore trouble. For the ſoul by any ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination, or notion, or feeling of a centre in the corrupt mind, cannot be healed or reſtored; but onely by having the true life raiſed up again in it, and it brought into its proper place and manſion in the fountain of life.</p>
            <p>There have been in the ſhakings of this Nation great ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:52304:41"/>
the ſeed ſpringing up, and great openings to the ſeed; the ſpirit of propheſy hath been enlarged in us, above what many of our fore-fathers felt: but the way into the ſpring of life hath not been known, where the preſervation is: ſo the whoriſh part, the corrupt part, the underſtanding which was not purified &amp; brought into ſubjection unto the truth, this har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot caught the openings and propheſtes of the true ſpirit, concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved with them, and brought forth children to the fleſh; bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for a more inward apprehenſion of things, a more ſpiritual kind of knowledg, as of God to be all, all to be good, and in God, and all ſin and evil done away there, &amp;c. and ſo ſuch a centre for the fleſhly mind (as it were) in him, as was not known before. And now the redemption is forgotten, the pantings after life ſlain, and the fleſh can lie down quiet in the un-redeemed eſtate, and ſay it is his wil, it is good, and it can reſt ſatisfied there in that wil of his which is good. Thus the great abomination from the ſubtle fleſh ſprung up, which made many hearts deſolate of very precious ſpringings up, and bud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings forth of the true life and power of God.</p>
            <p>But after this great loſs and betraying of the life in them, it hath pleaſed God to raiſe it up in others, and to diſcover the hammer, the ſword, the fire, which can knock down, cut down, burn up this whoriſh part: and thither the whore is brought, when ſhe comes to betray again; and the ſpringings up of life ſhrink back, and lie ſafe in the centre, while the whore is bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. And as the whore is burnt, the heir comes up, and the Spirit (which is the portion of his inheritance) deſcends and reſts upon him: and by this he is known: and that which is in union with him knows him. Therefore if you will live, come to that hammer, that ſword, that fire which fleſh dreads; and let the fleſh be delivered up to it: and do not deſpiſe the day of ſmal things, waiting for ſome great appearance, but know it in its loweſt knock; for its power of redemption is as truly there, as in its greateſt appearance. He that hath an ear, let him hear, and his ſoul ſhal live.</p>
            <p>Let thoſe therefore whom this concerns, conſider their waies (as the grace that appeared to me, hath taught me to do) and try their foundation, upon what they ſtand: and that they do
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:52304:42"/>
not kill what is opened, and live in the ſlain openings and ſo in the end become dark, airy, dry, withered, wheeling about and turning into the earth, it becoming their reſt and foundation again, and ſo looſing the joyes which formerly the opener did open. This, with me, many of you may witneſs: for whom my deſire is, that they may alſo witneſs the return to that which then opened, and live in the opener, and be preſerved by him from abuſing his precious openings any more.</p>
            <p>For though I had a true taſte of life and power from God, yet not knowing the foundation, there could be no true buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding with it: and ſo the ſpirit was quenched, the life waſted, the portion ſpent upon harlots, the true bread loſt, and chaff and husks fed upon, without the leaſt ſatisfaction to the ſoul; the ſenſe whereof, when the ſpirit of the Lord awakened me, did almoſt over-whelm me. Yea the bands of death were ſo ſtrengthned upon me, and the ſpirit of the word had taken ſuch hold of me, that I found my return very difficult: yea when living words of hope were mentioned to me; to draw me back to that principle of life from which I had gone out, I could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive nothing, but cry out impoſſible, impoſſible, impoſſible. I felt my ſelf like a tree twice dead, plucked up by the roots, without the capacity of life, ſence, or motion in the eternal be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any more. But at length it pleaſed life to move in a low way, in the midſt of the powers of darkneſs in my heart: and by ſinking low out of the wiſdom, out of the reaſon, out of all high imaginations, and truſting my ſelf to it, though dreadful ſtroaks and oppoſitions were felt from the powers of darkneſs, yet at length there was ſome appearance of the deliverer, in ſuch a poor, low, weak, deſpicable way, as could never have been welcomed, had not the ſoul been firſt brought to diſtreſs, and the loftineſs of the imaginary part brought down. And then coming out of that into the feeling, in another part; there was a ſeed ſprung up into a child: and as that child grows, and feeds on the milk of the immortal word, I live, &amp; am ſtrengthen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ed in him, and daily weakned in that part which lived before. Theſe are true words, from an honeſt heart, for the relief of thoſe who may have been entangled in the ſame ſnare.</p>

her beauty, and her garments were taken away, her ſeed was made war againſt, and was ſmitten and overcome and ſhe fled into the wilderneſs, and there hath ſat deſolate as a widow, lamenting the loſſe of her children, and being deprived of her husband, and the man child, which ſhould have ruled the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: for ſhe hath been fled into the Wilderneſs, and her for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer beauty hath not appeared to be, and her former glory hath ſeemed to be gone, and ſhe hath been driven away from her head, from her husband, and from her ſeed. Behold all people the Eſtate of ſuch a woman, and read this parable who can, a woman moſt glorious and fair, having her husband ruler of the whole earth, and having an heir born to rule over heaven and earth, being covered with the light of heaven, and of the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting day, and having the light of the night under her feet: yet hath this woman been deprived of her glory, and ſate de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolate in the Wilderneſs a mournfull place, ſeperated from her husband, and made childleſs and without ſeed: and what ey that ſees this a right, but muſt mourn; and what heart that truly perceives it, but muſt lament: a woman ſo great and ſo glorious, and ſo fruitful as to bring forth the heir of heaven and earth yet hath ſhe been left as a mourner, as without husband, and without iſſue for many generations; This hath been her eſtate and condition for ages, ſince the dayes of the Apoſtle, which <hi>John</hi> ſaw (in a viſion) would ſhortly come to paſs after him, and we ſee it hath been come to paſs within this ſixteen hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years; and this hath been the eſtate of the true Church for many ages, a woman childleſs, whoſe heir hath been taken from her, and whoſe ſeed hath been made war againſt and kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led for many generations. But her time was decreed, and ſhe ſhould but be thus for ſo many dayes: and now are the dayes expired, and ſhe again ſhall receive her heir that hath been caught up from her, and her ſeed ſhall ſpring forth, and her ſlain ſhall live, and her beauty ſhall be given her, and her firſt glory ſhall be increaſed, and ſhe ſhall feed no longer in the mourning.

               <p>Now as for all thoſe multitudes of ſects, and peoples that have profeſſed Religion, and as for all thoſe Churches ſo called, that hath gone under that name, which hath profeſſed Chriſt to be their head, and made a ſhew of him in appearance, the Papiſts Church, the Proteſtants Church, and all the ſects that hath riſen out of both of them, they have not been the true ſpouſe, the lambs wife, but children of fornication, and not of the ſeed of that woman that was once clothed with the Sun, and they are come up; and their original begun, while this true woman, this ſpouſe of Chriſt hath been childleſs: none of theſe are clothed with the ſun, nor none of them have brought forth the heir of ſalvation. Come let's reaſon with you: who was your mother? who brought you forth? and in what womb was you bred? you that have appeared in the World, and for many ages, for the true ſpouſe? The mother of the heir hath been childleſs, and as a widow baniſhed from her husband, and her heirs ſeperated from her, and her ſeed killed and made war a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt. She hath not born you nor brought you forth; then of what womb did you ſpring, all ye of the Papiſts and Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants Church, and all the ſects that came out of you, anſwer me this? None of you hath been fled into the Wilderneſs, for you have appeared in the World. None of you have been as a widow mourning; for you have been practiſing ordinances, and rejoycing in the World. None of you have been without iſſue, nor your ſeed made war againſt: for you have been fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in the World, and one ſect brought forth another, and one Church brought forth another, therefore none of you hath been that woman which <hi>John</hi> ſaw: for never none of you, from the leaſt to the greateſt of you, was ever clothed with the ſun, nor had the moon under your feet, nor ruled the Nations with the rod of iron: therefore none of you are the true ſpouſe, the lambs wife; he is not husband to any of you, nor is he your, child, nor heir. And this is the word of the Lord God to you all; you Churches and ſects, your beginning and ſpringing forth was from another womb, while this woman lodged in the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:52304:44"/>
and while ſhe was childleſs and without ſeed; and the mother of harlots brought you forth, the great whore whoſe ſuperſcription is Miſtery of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and her character is Mother of all abominations. For while this other woman hath been fled into the Wilderneſs, which <hi>John</hi> ſaw was fled thither, this woman the mother of harlots, which brought you fotth, hath been fruitful and flouriſhing, and hath had an husband and many children; for <hi>John</hi> ſpeaks of two women, of a whore, and of a virgin: of one, the bloud of whoſe ſeed was drunk, and the other drunk the bloud: yea, one that was made war with and againſt, for the Saints were killed and their blood drunk, and that other killed the Saints, and was made drunk with their bloud: the one was fled into the Wilderneſs he ſaw, of which I have ſpoken, and the other making all Nations drunk with her fornication, and ruling over all the Nations of the earth as a Queen; and while the one of thoſe, the virgin, the Lambs wife, hath been fled into the Wilderneſs, and left childleſs without ſeed; the other, the whore hath been fruitful, and brought forth many children, taken great pleaſure in the World, and committed fornication with the Kings of the earth: and theſe things <hi>John</hi> ſaw was to come to paſs, and we ſee (that have <hi>John's</hi> ſpirit) is come to paſs already. And come all ye Sects upon the earth, and Churches ſo called, that have been in the World for many ages, which of thoſe two women are you of? and the ſeed of whether of them are ye? who of theſe two was it that brought you forth? anſwer me, and make it appear. But I have ſaid already the virgin brought you not forth, the Lambs wife did not bear you, nor you are not of her: for you were brought forth while ſhe was baniſhed, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of her heir, and without her husband; and you are of the ſeed of that whore, the product of her fornications, ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated by the ſeed of adulterers: and though you have been warring, and fighting and ſtriving one againſt another, yet you were bred in one womb, and are of one ſeed: And though ſome of you in one appearance of the whores beauty brought forth have made war againſt them, brought forth in another appearance of her, and burned her fleſh; yet have ye given your power to the beaſt, and <hi>John</hi> ſaw that alſo, which we ſee is
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:52304:44"/>
fulfilled, ſome that ſhould hate the whore, and make war a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt her, yet ſhould they alſo give their power to the beaſt. This have we ſeen fulfild amongſt you ſects and falſe Churches, and your beginning we know, and the firſt beginning of whor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and when the whore began with her fornications, ſince which time all Nations have drunk her cup, and her ſent haſs been upon Nations, and multitudes, and peoples. Her firſt whoredom <hi>John</hi> ſpeaks of in his Epiſtle, and her beginning, they went out from the body, from the ſpouſe, and from the virgin; they went out from the true Church being falſe mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, not as ever being of the body of Chriſt, nor of the true Church, but ſuch as had been amongſt the members of the true Church and were once convinced which had got the form, and put on ſheeps cloathing upon the Wolviſh nature, and here was the beginning of her whordom ſhe went from the ſpouſe, and went into the World, and the World heard her and recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved her, and they drunk of her cup, and committed fornication with her, and ſhe played the whore in the unbelieving World, after ſhe departed from the Saints. She went out from them, and they denied her, and it was manifeſt ſhe was not of them: and this was the beginning of whoredoms: and ſhe was but young yet in her whordoms, and little in the World, and had not yet deceived many: but in proceſs of time it came to paſs, ſhe increaſed ſo mightily, that ſhe made all Nations drunk, and overcame them, Kings and Rulers, Bondmen and Freemen, they all drunk of her cup, and ſhe became ſo great, that Nations, kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds, multitudes and peoples was her ſeat, her place of gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, where ſhe ſate Ruler and Queen having dominion over all, and all was bewitched by her, and made drunk with her cup: and of this woman came ye, all ye ſects upon earth, and you are the multitudes, kindreds, and peoples upon, which her ſeat hath been, and over whom ſhe haſs had government. And this is ſhe that haſs drunk the bloud of the Saints, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come them, and the heir and ſeed of the other woman, the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, hath long been made war againſt, and killed and ſlain by this woman and her ſeed, and this hath been the ſtate of the Church for many ages, ſince the dayes of the Apoſtles ſhe haſs been fled, and her ſeed made war againſt and killed, and
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:52304:45"/>
her heir caught up to God, and the Nations which ſhould have been ruled by her heir, the whore haſs ſet upon them, and the peoples, and the multitudes which he ſhould have governed, hath been the ſeat of the <hi>Harlot,</hi> the mother of all abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations: and was it not like to be ſo, and how ſhould it be otherwiſe, when the manchild, the womans heir, haſs been caught up to God, and he haſs been as prevailed againſt, and the remnant of the womans ſeed made war againſt and kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and this hath been ſince the dayes of the Apoſtles? and ſo all you Churches and ſects, by what name ſoever you are known in the World, you are the ſeed of the great whore, and ſhe hath brought you forth, while the other woman haſs lodged in the Wilderneſs, and remains childleſs, if any man have an ear to hear, let him hear.</p>
               <p>Now it may be objected to me, and thus may it be ſaid, by this accompt the Church, the Lambs wife, haſs been prevailed againſt by the whore, becauſe it is ſaid ſhe hath killed the Saints, the members of Jeſus and of the Church; this ſeems to ſhew, as if the Church of Chriſt had been prevailed againſt, but Chriſt ſayes the gates of hel ſhall not prevail againſt them, but ſhe ſhould remain for ever, and the gates of hel ſhould not prevail againſt her, and how doth theſe two things agree? it ſeems doubtful to us, may ſome ſay.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> To all this I do anſwer, the true Church, the ſpouſe of Chriſt in her ſelf was never prevailed againſt, ſo as not to be in being, or that ſhe was not, but in her ſelf haſs remained in being, and not prevailed againſt, ſo, as not to have a place or being, and Chriſts words are true, ſhe haſs had a place and being, to wit in the deſert Wilderneſs, which place was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared her of God, there to be fed for, ſuch a time. So ſhe haſs a place and has a being, though in the Wilderneſs, a place deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late and of mourning. So ſhe haſs not been prevailed againſt, as that ſhe haſs not had a being; but the Lambs wife, the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the heir, that which is perfectly ſo; which was and is to be joyned to Chriſt, which is of his fleſh and bones taken out of him that cannot be prevailed againſt, never was, nor never ſhall be, for the divel nor Satan hath nothing in him, of whoſe fleſh and bones ſhe is; which is taken out of him, and it is as
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:52304:45"/>
poſſible for to prevail againſt him, as to prevail againſt her, for ſhe is of him, as <hi>Eve</hi> was of <hi>Adam,</hi> if any have an ear to hear they may hear. But her off-ſpring haſs been overcome her ſeed made war againſt, and her heir taken away, and caught up from her: ſo ſhe not prevailed againſt nor overcome, though baniſhed into the Wilderneſs, fled thither, and there haſs ſhe fed and had a place, and haſs been left childleſs, as I have ſaid. So the mother and the Lambs wife, hath had a being, and in her ſelfe never prevailed againſt nor overcome, and Chriſt's words are true: yet hath her ſeed been killed, and made war againſt, and overcome, as <hi>John</hi> ſaid; and both theſe are true, and this is my anſwer, and if any have an ear to hear they may hear, though a parable to the world, yet plain to the ſeed, which now God hath raiſed and is raiſing: for the woman again is returning, and her ſeed again is ſpringing, and ſhe is becoming as fruitful as ever, and her glory ſhal be as great, the light of heaven ſhal cloath her, and the light of the night ſhal be under her feet as perfectly, when ſhe is reſtored, as it was before the apoſtacy, though people cannot believe this in the apoſtacy. No reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation, nor immediate teaching, nor miracles now to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, cry the profeſſors, and theſe falſe ſects and Churches: it was extraordinary times, and extraordinary manifeſtations were amongſt the Apoſtles and Churches of old, ſay they, but the ſame now is not to be expected, nor never to be looked for, but thus they are in blindneſs and ignorance, and unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief. But we believe the glory of this woman, that hath been long fled into the wilderneſs, and hath been long without iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue while ſhe hath been fled, ſhal have the ſame fruit and iſſue, and the ſame clothing that ſhe had before ſhe fled. When the whore and her ſeed is removed from the face of the earth, the glory of the Lambs wife ſhal be as great, her beauty as fair, her fruit as plenteous as before the whore was: and they that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it not, believes not the Scriptures: for that teſtifies of the glory of the Church to be the greateſt in the laſt dayes, as we are ſure and certainly know it ſhal come to paſs, when the waters are dried up, which hath been the ſeat of the great whore.</p>
               <p>Now though all thoſe Churches and ſects of people are ſaid to be, and known to be the ſeed of the whore, and not of the
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:52304:46"/>
Virgin, as I have declared: and though Nations, and Peoples, and multitudes have been all running to ſornication, and been deceived, and made drunk, yet this I have to ſay, in all ſorts of people, and amongſt all thoſe ſects, amongſt Papiſts and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, and all ſects riſen out of them, in thouſands of people, notwithſtanding the darkneſs and all the Apoſtacy that has ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in the general; yet in ſome of all ſorts and ſects there hath been a ſincerity, and ſimplicity, and a deſire and zeal for God, and of God in them and amongſt them: yet the ſincerity, ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity, and deſire which hath ſtirred in ſome of all ſects, it hath no ſoonet appeared, but it hath been ſmitten, and betrayed by the wicked without, and ſo by the error of judgement within: for even amongſt the worſt of ſects, we know there is ſome in whom there is ſimplicity, and ſincerity and zeal; and yet erre in judgment, for this is poſſible: and we know it is ſo with thouſands, and ten thouſands at this day, there may be a ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity, and zeal, and ſincerity of heart, and yet err in judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, &amp; the judgment not truly guided, by the Spirit of the Lord; but a falſe ſpirit, and a falſe thing, even the ſpirit of whoredom it ſelf ruling the judgment, and be chief there: and this deſtroyes, &amp; murders, and betrayes the zeal and ſimplicity; and this is, and hath been ever ſince the dayes of the Apoſtles, great error in judgment, and the judgement of all thoſe ſects have been miſ-guided and miſted, and a falſe thing, and not the ſpirit of the Lord has guided the judgment, and thereby the true ſincerity, zeal and ſimplicity hath been enſlaved and held under, by reaſon of the erring in judgment: and the ſtate of ſuch are truly to be lamented, where ſimplicity is devoured, and ſincerity betrayed, and held captive by the whoriſh ſpirit that ſits ruler in judgment. I do not ſpeak of all people of all ſects, that they have zeal and ſimplicity; but of ſome people in all ſects, and through all theſe falſe Churches, and ſo the ſpirit which has guided the judgment, that has abaſed the zeal, and abuſed the ſincerity, and betrayed it; ſo people have been a running, running after the form, and blind in judgement, and loſt ſincerity, and ſimplicity that has been betrayed in them, though ſometime appearing and ſtirring, and ſo the wrong part in people has fed upon the form and appearance, and the
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:52304:46"/>
ſeed ſtarved, and the ſincerity eaten out, and ſo one ſect hath made this the rule of their judgment, and another ſect another thing, the rule of their judgment, one cries tradition, another Scriptures another cries the practice of Saints before us, &amp; none of all have been guided in judgment by the ſpirit of the Lord; and where the ſpirit of the Lord is not the onely rule of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, guiding the judgment in all things, that people and that man, are in error, and the ſincerity in them hath not its free courſe, but bound under with a ſpirit which is bondage, and leads into bondage; and when people comes to be turned to the light of Chriſt in them, and receive a meaſure of the Spirit of the Lord to guide the judgment, then the ſincerity and ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity and zeal wil grow, and thrive, and be increaſed: but til then the good is eaten out, that lies under and is oppreſſed, and ever and alwaies, the deſire quenched the ſincerity loſt, the ſimplicity betrayed by the ſpirit of whoredom which rules the judgment; and theſe things are manifeſt in our age, therefore all people come out of your ſects and falſe Churches, for the woman is returned, and returning out of the wilderneſs, and the ſeed ſhal ſpring forth as in the dayes of old.</p>

               <p>THere hath been a great War between the woman and her ſeed, and the harlot and her ſeed, from the beginning to this day; and they have each had their pre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>vailings in the war.

Thus the Devil gat poſſeſſion of the Jewiſh ſtate, ſo that there was no room for the true Church there, but all was in idolatry and corruption; and the Lord was not ſerved by their ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, by their ſacrifices, by their Sabbaths, by their new moons, by their Temple-worſhip, &amp;c. but the Devil. And the Devil alſo got poſſeſſion of the heaven and earth in the Chriſtian ſtate, ſo that in their Ordinances, in their worſhips, in their duties, in that which they call their Churches, God hath not been wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped in truth, but the Devil for this many ages. For mark, who was it that got into the Temple of God? was it not An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt? was it not the Spirit of Satan? 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2. 4.

The woman was aſſaulted here, her ſtrong holds taken from her, ſo that ſhe could not ſtay ſafe in that heaven and earth, which God had made for her: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there was another place prepared for her by God in the wilderneſs, and ſhe had wings of an Eagle given her to fly thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but the Dragon got into, and held poſſeſſion of that hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven where ſhe was before, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12. So that none hath known the Church all this time, but he that hath been born of her in the wilderneſs, which was a place the world never dreamed of, but looked for her in the heaven and the earth which the Devil had got poſſeſſion of. And here they cry up the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, the Ordinances, duties, the Church, the Miniſtry, &amp;c. (as the Jews did the Temple of the Lord, the Temple of the Lord) not knowing in whoſe hands theſe were, and whom they worſhipped hereby. Now conſider this O ye Chriſtians, I ſpeak what I aſſuredly know, that God could not be truly worſhipped in any of theſe, while they were in the Devils hands; but the whoriſh Spirit, and her ſeed worſhip here; and the worſhip of the Church and her ſeed: was a wilderneſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worſhip, or a worſhip which ſhe learned of God in the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Mark now and conſider my teſtimony, O ye Chriſtians. I deny all the worſhip, all the Ordinances which were taught the Chriſtians of old, now practiſed by the whoriſh ſpirit: for the Devil had gained it, and corrupted it, and having corrupted it, God could not be any more worſhipped in it; but the Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian ſpirit ſate there, giving forth thoſe things as his Laws; He ſate in the Temple of God, and there made uſe of the Veſſels and Ordinances, which he had carried captive into his Babylon; and I deny it to be poſſible to have any true uſe of theſe, til the time of the recovery. And now the time of the recovery is come, and the reſtitution begun, people know it not; but cry up the old heaven and the old earth, which Satan had corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſetting it up in oppoſition againſt the new, which God hath new formed, and is bringing forth in true beauty and glory.</p>
               <p>Now in this war, though the Devil, though the harlot and her ſeed gat the womans ſeat from her, and baniſhed her ſeed

as it were out of the earth; yet they were not able to touch the woman, nor to over-come the life of God in her ſeed, but onely to kil their bodies; but the life was ſtil conqueror over them, and not ſubjected to them. They could raiſe up Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and Ordinances, and Miniſters and duties, and cauſe all that dwel on the earth to worſhip, in ſome part or other of this Babylon: but they could never make the ſeed bow to any of their images, nor could they hurt the woman hereby who was in the wilderneſs, out of the reach of all theſe: And there ſhe did eat the bread of life with tears, mourning over her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolate eſtate, and her loſs of children: And here alone was the true bread of life, which was not to be known or taſted of, in any of the Ordinances of the Apoſtacy: ye wil all one day acknowledge this to be a true teſtimony, held forth to you in true love: it were good for you that ye could ſee it now.</p>

               <head>A brief account of what we are, and what our work is in the World.</head>
               <p>WE are a people whom God hath converted to himſelf, a people in whom God hath raiſed up the ſeed of his own life, and cauſed it to reign over the earthly part in our ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves, a people whom God hath divorced from the ſpirit of whordom, and joyned to his own ſpirit. We, many of us, ſought truly and only after God from our child hood (our conſciences bear us witneſs in the ſight of God) but the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty of our hearts was ſtil betrayed, and we led aſide by the whoriſh ſpirit, and knew not how to turn to that of God in us, which inclined us towards God. By this means we came to great diſtreſs and miſery, beyond all men. Not but that all men were in as great a want of God (his life, power, and preſence) as we; but the ſence thereof was not ſo quickned in others, as in us. Now it pleaſed the Lord at length to pitty us, and to inform our minds towards himſelf, to ſhew us where life lay, and where death lay, and how to turn from the one, and to the other, and he gave us his helping hand to turn us. And by being turned to him, we have taſted of the truth, of the true wiſdom, of the true power, of the true life, of the true righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, of the true redemption: and by receiving of this from God, and taſting and handling of it, we come to know that that which the World hath ſet up in the ſtead of it, is not the thing it ſelf. Now mark, we are not perſons that have ſhot up out of the old root into another appearance, as one Sect hath done out of another till many are come up one after another, the ground ſtil remaining the ſame out of which they all grew: but that ground hath been ſhaken and ſhaking, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed and deſtroying, removed and removing in us, and the old root of <hi>Jeſſe</hi> hath been made manifeſt in us, and we have been tranſplanted by the everlaſting power of life, and a real change brought forth in us out of that ſpirit, wherein the World lives and worſhips, into another ſpirit, into which no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb facs="tcp:52304:49"/>
which is of the World can enter. And here we have met with the cal of God, the converſion to God, the regeneration in God, the juſtification, the ſanctification, the wiſdom, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, the true life and power of God, which the World cannot ſo much as bear the name of. And what we are made of God in Chriſt, we know to be truth, and no lie: and when we teſtifie of this to the World, in the meaſure of the life of God in us, we ſpeak truth and no lie; though the World, which knoweth not the truth, cannot hear our voice.</p>
               <p>Now our work in the World, is to hold forth the vertues of him that hath called us, to live like God; not to own any thing in the World which God doth not own: to forget our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, our kindred, our Fathers houſe; and to live like perſons of another country, of another kindred, of another family: not to do any thing of our ſelves, and which is pleaſing to the old nature, but all our words, all our converſation, yea every thought in us is to be come new. Whatever comes from us, is to come from the new principle of life in us, and to anſwer that in others, but we muſt not pleaſe the old nature at all in our ſelves, nor in any elſe. And walking faithfully thus with God, we have a reward at preſent, and a crown in the end, which doth and will countervaile all the reproches and hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips, we do or can meet with in the World.</p>
               <p>We are alſo to be witneſſes for God, and to propagate his life in the World; to be inſtruments in his hand, to bring others out of death and captivity unto true life and liberty: we are to fight againſt the powers of darkneſs every where, as the Lord calleth us forth. And this we are to do in his wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, according to his will, in his power, and in his love, ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and meekneſs. We are not to take wayes according to our own wiſdom (but there muſt be a ſtrict watch, ſet in the life, leaſt that get up again:) nor muſt we ſpeak ſuch words, as mans wiſdom would call wiſe: nor may we go in our own will to ſeek any, but the Lord muſt go before: nor may we make uſe of our own ſtrength, but feel his arme in our weakneſs: nor may we go forth in that love, ſweetneſs, or meekneſs vvhich is pleaſing to the fleſhly minde: but vve muſt be true to God, handling the ſvvord skilfully and faithfully, judging and cutting
<pb facs="tcp:52304:49"/>
down the tranſgreſſor in the power and authority of God, and when the meek, the lowly, the humble thing is reached and raiſed, then the true love, the ſweetneſs the tenderneſſe, the meekneſs muſt go forth to that. The Lord God is tough with the tranſgreſſor, and all a long the Scripture heweth and judgeth him: and if we come forth in the ſame ſpirit, we ſhall finde the ſame leadings, where we meet with the ſame thing: for the Lord God will never be tender there; nor can that which comes from him, lives in him, is lead by him, be tender there where he is not.</p>
               <p>Now the very root of this ſeverity is good, and of God, and hath love and ſweetneſs at the bottom of it: yea in pittie, love, and bowels do we uſe the ſword. It is in pitty to the poor cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tived creature, that that might be cut down, which keeps it in bonds and captivity. And though we ſeem enemies to all ſorts of men, for the Lords ſake: yet we are not enemies, nor could do the leaſt hurt to them any way, but are true friends to their ſouls, and bodies alſo: and our only controverſie is with that which captives and makes them miſerable: for we fight not at all with fleſh and bloud, but with the principality and power which led from God, and rules in it againſt God, to the poor creatures ruine and deſtruction. Yea if we had all the powers of the earth in our hands, we could not ſet up our own way, (if, after the manner of men, I may ſo call it) or ſo much as diſturb others in their way thereby, but ſhould waite in patience, till God gave us an entrance by his power.</p>
               <p>Now let not men run on in heats againſt us, but let them ſeriouſly conſider, whether we be of God or no: and let them conſider, not with the reaſon and underſtanding which is alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated from God, but with the witneſs which lies hid in the heart. There is one great palpable argument that we are of God, which is this, all the World is againſt us, the Wordly part every where fights with us, the Wordly part in every ſort and Sect of men oppoſeth us, the rage of man every where riſeth up againſt us; But thoſe that are ſo hot againſt us, if at any time they become but meek and calme, patiently conſidering our cauſe, and conſulting there upon with the teſtimony that they finde in their own hearts concerning us, they ſoon become pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſied,
<pb facs="tcp:52304:50"/>
and ſee that we are no mans enemies, againſt no righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Law, not againſt relations, not againſt Governments, not againſt any thing in the World that is good, but only againſt that which is evil and corrupt. And of a truth, the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of things God hath ſhewed unto us, and daily cals us forth after an immediate manner, to witneſs againſt.</p>
               <p>Therefore let men be ſober, and take heed what they do, leaſt they be found fighters againſt God: for the reproaches, the ſcoffs, with other preſecutions, which ſeem to be caſt at us, light on him. It is not as we are men, but as we are obedient to him, as we ſtand witneſſes for him, that we meet vvith theſe things. Novv, as it is not vve our ſelves that do theſe things, but the life and povver of God in us; ſo it is not vve that are ſtruck at, but that life and povver: If it vvere not for that, vve might be as acceptable as other men. It is becauſe vve are not of the World, but God hath called us out of the World, that vve are ſo hated of the World. This is the true cauſe, though the World vvill no more novv acknovvledge it, than it vvould in former ages. Yet I do not ſpeak this for my ovvn ſake, to avoid my ſhare in the croſs: for the reproach of Chriſt is our riches, yea far grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter treaſure, then is to be found in the Palace of Egypt. Yea the preſence of God, the ſvveet povver of life makes up all our loſſes, ſo that vve have no cauſe to complain. It is very ſvveet, pleaſant, and profitable for us to be found ſufferers for God; but vve knovv it vvill not be profitable for you to be found perſecutors: and this is told you in true love and good vvill, by one vvho vviſhes no evill to you, for all the evill that ye have exerciſed tovvard the dear and precious people of God for theſe many years. O that God vvould open your eyes, that ye might ſee vvhom yee have oppoſed, and againſt vvhom ye have hardened and ſtrengthned your ſelves, that ye might bovv to him, and receive life from him, and not periſh in your gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaying and oppoſition.</p>

So this is the true light, who hath inlightned every one that cometh into the World, that all through the light might believe: and he that believes, hath the witneſs in himſelf; and he that believes, ſets to his ſeale that God is true, who hath ſent his Son to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten him, him by whom the World was made, in whom was life, and his life was the light of men; and this is it which ſhines in darkneſs, and the darkneſs cannot comprehend it; And there is the ſtate of all confuſion, and Sects, and opinions upon the earth, the darkneſs profeſſing Chriſts, the Prophets, the Apoſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les, <hi>Davids, Abrahams,</hi> and the Saints words, and yet the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs cannot comprehend the light which Chriſt hath inlightned

And to you this is the word of the Lord God, and to your age and generation, the cauſe of all deceit and ſtrife upon the earth, is, becauſe men have been in tranſgreſſion, Heathens, Jews, and Gentiles from Chriſt the light, under the devils power, out of truth; the cauſe of all Chriſtians being on heaps one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and their bad converſation, that the heathen cries ſhame of them, hath been becauſe they have been out of the light which they have profeſſed, in which they ſhould have ſerved God, and had unity with Scriptures, and one with another, and with God, and with that anſwer the principle of God in all upon the the earth, and not by ſerving Jdols, becauſe of the vanities of their minds and unconverted ſtate; ſo all upon the earth that ſets up likeneſſes and Jmages, are under vanities, becauſe of the corruption of their own minds, and the vanity of them: But the day of reſtauration is come into Chriſt the light and cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of God, and all upon the earth that ſets up Jmages and Jdols, likneſſes, and ſerves dead works, and hath a dead faith, and not the faith of <hi>Abraham,</hi> the faith of the elect, that gives every one to ſee Chriſt, and have acceſſe to God, and ſuch need not to have any dead thing to put them in minde of him, ſo all that ſet up ſuch things, whatſoever likeneſſes and Jmages, doth the light which Chriſt hath inlightned them withall, bring them off from into light and covenant with God (loving it) unto ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and to ſee it and to covenant with God, there is every ones teacher, loving it; there is every ones condemnation, hat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it; and they there with the light, that every one is inlightned withall, ſhall come to ſee the Prophet raiſed up, and there none ſhall be cut of that do hear this Prophet, and there every one ſhall have his reward according to his works, from the Son who hath inlightned them, who is come to judge the World in righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs,

               <head>An addition concerning the doctrine of Juſtification.</head>
               <p>BEcauſe the doctrine of Juſtification is of great concernment, and the enemy of mankind hath exceedingly endeavoured to corrupt it, and in the Apoſtacy hath greatly prevailed, and the darkneſs which ſprings up in the fleſhly wiſdom, is exceeding thick at the day concerning this thing; therefore in true love to ſouls it is laid upon me, to ſearch into the Scriptures, which chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpeaks thereof, and from thence to clear it up to ſuch, who are not yet come to the life that gave forth the Scriptures.</p>
               <p>The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> doth largely and fully treat of it, in his Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle to the <hi>Romans,</hi> and lays down ſeveral things concerning it, which if wel heeded, may daſh mens preſent apprehenſions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it, and bring them to wait for the opening of thoſe Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to them, in another light then you have yet known.</p>
               <p n="1">1. He affirms that Juſtification is not <hi>by the deeds of the Law,</hi> Ro. 3. 20. If a man could ſay with the young man, All theſe things have I done from my youth; or as <hi>Paul,</hi> that he was as touching the Law blameleſs, yet could he not be juſtified thereby:</p>
               <p>And the Apoſtle gives a mighty reaſon; <hi>for by the law is the knowledg of ſin.</hi> Now Juſtification is not by the making of ſinne known, but by that which ſaves and delivers from it. The know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of ſin may put a man upon ſeeking out for juſtification, but it cannot juſtifie him, but rather condemn him; but that which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livers him from the ſin, which the law makes known, that juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies him.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="97" facs="tcp:52304:52"/>
2. He affirms that <hi>the righteouſneſs of God</hi> (which is the juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation) <hi>is manifeſted without the law,</hi> v. 21. The Law makes ſin known, and ſhews the ſinner the need of juſtification, but the juſtification it ſelf is not thereby, but is manifeſted with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it. The Law commands the nature to act that pertains to ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militudes, figures, and types, and ſhadows, to the obedience of them, but the ſeed takes away the nature that pertains to ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litudes, and ſhadows, and the works of the law: ſo to the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of thoſe things the law commands there is juſtification by the law, in the obedience to the works it commands: but the juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, Chriſt, removes the nature, that pertains to thoſe things the law commands: ſo that juſtification, the law, ends in Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That this righteouſneſs or juſtification is <hi>witneſſed by the law and the Prophets,</hi> v. 21. The law, though it is not the juſtification, nor can the juſtification be by obedience to it, or by the deeds of it, yet it gives teſtimony to the juſtification: for the ſubſtance of what the law and all the Prophets witneſs, is, that nothing can juſtifie but the righteouſneſs of God.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That this righteouſneſs or juſtification is <hi>by the faith of Chriſt,</hi> v. 22. by believing or entring into that which juſtifies. As con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation was by unbelier, by joyning unto and entring into the ſpirit of enmity: ſo juſtification, is by joyning unto &amp; entring into the ſpirit of love, by true union with Chriſt in the ſpirit, which union is by the faith which comes from Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="5">5. That this juſtification or righteouſneſs is <hi>upon all that believe,</hi> v. 22. He that receiveth the faith, believeth; and he that believeth hath the righteouſneſs: and he that believeth not, cannot have the righteouſneſs, but the condemnation &amp; wrath abideth on him.</p>
               <p n="6">6. That this juſtification is <hi>freely by the grace,</hi> v. 24. There is no way to come to this righteouſneſs but by the gift of grace, which gift is given freely. Therefore if ever man wil be juſtified, he muſt know the grace, and the gift which comes from the grace, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it: &amp; receiving it, he cannot miſs of juſtification, and not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving it, (but either being ignorant of it, or reſiſting of it) he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not poſſibly be juſtified.</p>
               <p n="7">7. That this juſtification is by the <hi>redemption in Chriſt,</hi> v. 24. Chriſt is redeemer, the redemption (wherein is the juſtification) is in him, and there is no way of meeting with the juſtification, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, but by receiving of him in whom it is; and he who hath
<pb facs="tcp:52304:53"/>
him, hath the juſtification, and is made partaker of the redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and he who hath not him, hath it not.</p>
               <p>Mark then, the juſtification or redemption, is not by believing of a thing done without man (though that alſo is to be believed) but by receiving of him into the heart. For the virtue of all Chriſt did without, is within him: &amp; I cannot be made partaker by belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving that he did ſuch a thing without, or that he did it for me, but by receiving the virtue of it into me, and feeling the virtue of it in me. This is that which ſaves me, and makes that which was done without, to be mine.</p>
               <p n="8">8. That Chriſt is <hi>the propitiation,</hi> v. 25. or that which pacifies and makes way for ſinners to God, ſo that he that truly receiveth Chriſt, hath the atonement; but he that hath not received him, only dream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of peace with God, but ſtil remaineth in the enmity, and is li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the wrath, having the bond of iniquity over him, and is in the night.</p>
               <p n="9">9. That this Propitiation is by <hi>faith in the blood,</hi> v. 25. There is nothing pacifies God, but the blood of his Son; and thre is nothing feels the blood, but the faith, and that which is in the faith. A man may read Scriptures, and gather notions about juſtification, and think he believes, a right, and ſhal be juſtified; but he never comes to feel the blood, nor the life which is in the blood, till he receive the faith, and then he knoweth the true propitiation, and the true peace, which before he did but talk of.</p>
               <p n="10">10. That this faith is <hi>the righteouſneſs;</hi> Faith is the gift of God, and this gift juſtifies; this gift is the juſtification, this is that which God <hi>imputeth for righteouſneſs,</hi> ch. 4 v. 3. &amp; 5. The faith is in the blood, and the blood is in the Son, and in the true receiving of the Son, both the faith and the blood are known, and felt. Theſe are true words, though hard to the fleſhly ear; do not ſtumble in the wiſdom, but calmly wait for the revelation of the ſpirit, and then thou wilt ſay, the price of this knowledg is not to be valued; &amp; if once thou come to taſt truth here, all thy knowledg in the letter wil be but droſs with thee. <hi>Ye are come to the blood of ſprinkling<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> O do not reſt in an outward way of believing an outward thing, but ſeek out the way of coming to the blood of ſprinkling.</p>
               <p n="11">11. That the juſtification is of the <hi>ungodly,</hi> v. 5. He whom God maketh righteous, was ungodly before he made him righteous. There was nothing but unrighteouſneſs could be imputed to him in tranſgreſſion before he gave him his Son, and made him righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in his Son; for nothing is righteous with God but Chriſt, and
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:52304:53"/>
man only as he taken into his righteouſnes; which is done, not by a believing from the bare leter, but by a receiving of faith in the life.</p>
               <p n="12">12. That the juſtification of the ungodly, is by believing in him that juſtifieth, <hi>v.</hi> 5. The gift of faith goes forth from him, is recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved into the heart: now both by the gift it ſelf, and by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of it, is the juſtification: by receiving of the gift is the perſon juſtified, by the exerciſe of the gift are all his actions juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied. Chriſt being let in to the heart, juſtifies the heart into which he is received; and Chriſt being in the heart, juſtifies every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and action that comes from his life; and any other motion or action is not juſtified, for it is out of that which is juſtified, and is in and from that which is condemned.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Abraham believed God, and it was counted anto him for righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> v. <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. God promiſed him a ſeed, he believed God, God bid him ſacrifice this type, he believed. This was it was imputed to him for righteouſneſs. Now if he had not believed, if he had not received the gift, or not exerciſed the gift, could he have been righteous? ſo that <hi>Abraham</hi> was not juſtified by any work he did or could do, but by receiving and exerciſing the faith in the ſeed: by going out of his country kindred and fathers houſe, not of himſelf but by faith, and by living to God, and obeying his voice in that land to which he was led, not in his own wil or power, but in the faith. And by hearing the call of God, and receiving the faith, and living out of ſelf out of a mans own underſtanding, wil and power, in the faith and living power and wiſdom of God is the juſtification now: and they that do thus are the children of <hi>Abraham,</hi> born of the free woman, when as they that take up practiſes from the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, without being ingraffed into the life, are but children of the bond woman, but ſuch children of <hi>Abraham</hi> as the Jews were, (if ſo much) and can not inherit that promiſe which belongs to the ſpiritual ſeed, while they live in that ſtate.</p>
               <p n="13">13. That wher the faith which is imputed unto righteouſneſs is found, there <hi>ſin is not imputed, but covered,</hi> which is a bleſſed ſtate, <hi>v.</hi> 6, 7, 8. Sin cuts off from God, who is life &amp; bleſſedneſs; ſin laies open to the wrath of the creator, which is too great for the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor to bear: woe and miſery wil be his portion, to whom God imputes ſin. But happy is he who has his ſin covered: this is an happy condition, life and immortality will ſoon be opened to him. Now this bleſſedneſs cometh not by the works of the law, for they cannot remove the ſin, but by the righteouſneſs of
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:52304:54"/>
faith, which is able to cover the ſin even from the pure ey of God. O Chriſtians, chriſtians, do not imagine your ſelves covered from ſin, but know it, feel it; never reſt till ye are ſo made parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of the true righteouſneſs, that by its virtue in you, ye may be paſt all doubt that it is it. Believing from the letter without you, that ye are juſtified, may eaſily deceive you; but if once ye come truly to feel in your ſelves, the thing which juſtifies, and ſo find the power and life of it in you, above the power of all that which condemns, caſting out the condemned thing, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demner with all his works out of your hearts, this cannot deceive. The virtue of life was loſt in the Apoſtacy, and that which was living did not ſo much enjoy life, as mourn after it: and the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer and ſafety of life did then appear moſt in mourning: but now the Apoſtacy draws towards an end, and the virtue begins to ſhoot up again: and he that wil be a Chriſtian now, muſt be ſo, not by retaining his old notions, but by feeling this new virtue, and by growing up in this new-ſprung life and power of the Lord, whoſe appearance is new to us, who have not been acquainted with it, but have been brought up in the darkneſs of the apoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and lived in the waters, where great Leviathan ruled, and who was able to make war with him there? But he that ſeeketh, is joyned with, and keepeth to that power which drieth up the waters, and putteth an hook into the noſtrils of the Leviathan, ſhall find the world with the whole courſe of it, ending in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and the beginning and growth of an endleſs life: and in whom that life lives, they ſhall live alſo; but wher death keeps the power of life down, ſuch ſhal not live, or know the bleſſing, but abide under the curſe of miſery and death, and under the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers of darkneſs. Therefore look about you, and make a wiſe choice; for his ſervants ye are whom ye obey, whether the Prince of darkneſs in his invented forms of godlineſs, or the Prince of light it the living power: and your reward ſhall be, according to your choice and work, either death in the death, if ye chuſe and joyn to that, or life in the life, if ye joyn to that. He that hath an ear to hear, let him hear.</p>
