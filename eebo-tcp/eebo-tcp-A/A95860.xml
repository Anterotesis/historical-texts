         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Here preſent thee with a moſt ſtupenatous
Relation of a father, formerly loving his
children even to doting, and now without
any juſt provocation abhorring his owne
fleſh: of two ſiſters that heretofore were
tranſcendent in the profeſsion of Saint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
and now apoſtatized into Libertine
and unnaturall practiſes: the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>he that provides
not for his family hath denyed the faith, and is worſe then an
Infidell:</hi> here ſhalt thou ſee a father ſo far from providing for
his dutifull children, that he ſtrips them of all that which God hath
given him, and gives it to ſtrangers; the Apoſtle ſaies <hi>of theſe
latter dayes, that there ſhall be ſeducers, that ſhall creep in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
houſes, and lead captive filly women, laden with ſins,
led away with divers luſts:</hi> here behold ſeducing women cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
in wickedneſſe, creeping into a ſilly mans houſe, and lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him captive to their wicked purpoſes, and to his owne and
his families utter ruine. Stories make mention of certaine Sea-Monſters
whoſe upper parts are the reſemblance of beautifull
women, and the neather parts of an ugly fiſh, who by their melo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious
voices entiſe the unwary paſſengers to attention, and then
ſuddenly ſeiſe and devoure them; here behold two Land Sirens
or monſters, being neither maides, wives, nor widowes, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
only the ſhape of women, charming with the muſick of their
fained ſpeeches, a ſilly old man, and ſuddenly ſeiſing and devou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb facs="tcp:112552:3"/>
both him and all his family. I doe profeſſe in the preſence
of God; I am not conſcious to have ſet downe one paſſage that I
ſcruple the truth of it; to moſt of them I have been an Ocular
witneſſe. That which is moſt remote from my owne knowledge
hath ſeverall times been related to me by their owne husbands.
My intention in this publication is not to defame the parties here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
concerned, but to diſcover the truth which by their feigned
pretences and foule practiſes hath been grievouſly defamed: I
have alſo conſidered, that haply this narrative may light into
the hands of old Mr. <hi>Goodwin,</hi> and who can tell but when he
ſhall ſee in this true glaſſe his whole ſhape at once, and behold
what a deformed Creature his ſinfull converſe with theſe women
hath made him; who can tell I ſay, but he that hitherto hath
ſtood out againſt all the reproofes and admonitions of godly
friends, and Miniſters, profeſsing that he valued their reproofes
no more then the dirt under his feet, by the powerfull aſsiſtance
of the Spirit of God his ſecret thoughts may rebound within him,
his heart throb, his bowells be moved, and he may ſmite upon
the thigh, and ſay, what have I done? Reader, here thou wilt
ſee a Land-wrack, where there are in theſe perilous times more
rocks and quick ſands then in the great Ocean, and all for
want of minding the Compaſſe. Let it teach thee to keep to the
rule of Gods word, to grow in Grace, and to ſtand faſt in ſound
principles, to ſtand amaſed at thy owne vileneſſe and Gods good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
ſo wilt thou be humble and thankfull, and be preſerved
from the ſnares of ſeducers.</p>

            <pb n="1" facs="tcp:112552:3"/>
            <p>
               <hi>MAſter Weſſell Goodwin,</hi> one of the principal ſubjects of
this relation, was borne in the Borough of Southwark,
where yet he liveth, bred up in the myſtery of a Dier; of
whoſe Deſcent and parentage I will not mention one
word, that I may contract my diſcourſe, keeping cloſe to the ſubject
I have undertaken. About the twenty ſixth of his age, he married
Miſtris <hi>Ellenor Armeſtrong</hi> a Lieceſter ſhire Gentlewoman of an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
honorable Familie, a woman of the moſt excellent frame of
ſpirit that I ever met with, judicious, ſober, vertuous, and above
all, religious, a Charitable heart, that would ſeldom ſend away the
poore without a double Almes, relief for the body, and good coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel
for the ſoul; that in ſome things ſeemed parſimonious, that on
juſt occaſions ſhee might be the more liberal; that could finely di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
her Husband from his follies, and yet give him all due reſpect;
by her he hath four children, three ſonns, one daughter, all hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomely
educated: for many years they continued in good corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondency
of affection, till towards her latter daies, that his folly
would admit of no reſtraint.</p>
            <p>Amongſt other extravagancies, he was ever ſtrangely given to
muſick, to which he had a ravenous appetite; five pounds for pricking
out two or three leſſons, which when he had, he underſtood like
Arabick; thirty pounds for a Lute, of which he had with other
ſorts of fiddles, a whole roome full; and which is the wonder, can
ply of none, only admires them, ten pounds at a time to a muſick
Maſter for a months teaching (or rather playing to him.) And as at
<hi>Virginia</hi> Tobacco, and at the <hi>Barbadoes</hi> Sugar is put in the place of
money, ſo many hundred weight for a field or a Cow, ſo doth he
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:112552:4"/>
fondly thinks muſick to be that which anſwers all things. I'le give
but one inſtance from an hundred, coming one day to ſee his Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<hi>Vernon,</hi> he uſed theſe words to her Husband, Sonne, quoth he,
I am ſorry I cannot doe for you as I would, I ſee you have a great
charge, and trading is bad, which I doe conſider, and therefore
will beſtow upon my daughter a ſuite of Mr. <hi>Rogers</hi> his new leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
I am ſorry to ſpoile paper with ſuch fooleries; but there is a
neceſſity that the ſequent truth may the better appeare. I might add
his training up all his children to muſick, and ſo farr as they gave
way to his muſickal diſtemper, ſo far they were dutiful and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent;
ſo far as they ſlighted muſick, wicked and rebellious; for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
his ſecond ſon being intended (through his Mothers im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
for a Prentice) accordingly he was put to an able writer
to perfect his hand; but ſtill he plies him to have a great care of his
Lute, and would needes have brought him a muſick Maſter to the
houſe where he boarded; and when by the youth and his ſon <hi>Vernon</hi>
he was told he had muſick enough, and could not now ſo unſeaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably
atend ſo much muſick, he fell into a great rage againſt his ſaid
ſon <hi>Vernon,</hi> telling him he had Corrupted his ſon with his counſel,
but ſhould corrupt no more of his children.</p>
            <p>About the 58 yeare of his age, his vertuous wife fell ſick of a
painfull diſeaſe contracted by melancholy, of which in a few mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neths
ſhe died. I ſhould not mention any of the private unkind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes
with which ſhe long ſtrugled, and at laſt ſunke under, only
this particular I may not omit.</p>
            <p>When ſhe drew neare her death, ſome few dayes before her
departure, overhearing the muſick which was daily in the next
roome, ſhe deſired one of her ſons to call in their father, to whom
with a broken ſad voice ſhe ſaid, Husband, you well know what a
burthen this Exceſſe of muſick hath been to me all my life; muſt
that which hath been ſo much affliction to me in my life, be brought
to my death bed? may I not dye out of the noiſe of it? pray for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare,
I have not many houres to live, and then you may have your
fill of muſick. To which he replied not one word, but went out in
diſcontent and ſo fel to his muſick againe.</p>
            <p>The third day after, ſhee departed this life; a little before her
death ſhee called to her her ſon in Law and daughter <hi>Vernon,</hi> deſiring
them amongſt other requeſts to ſee to the Education of her two
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:112552:4"/>
younget ſons, the Eldeſt being a little before married to a vertuous
maid of an honeſt and Religious Neighbour familie, for which ſhee
much rejoyced, hoping that her eldeſt ſon now taken into partner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
with his Father, and matcht with a ſtay'd diſcreet wife, the Old
man would the more delight himſelfe in his children and condition
and take himſelf off from his extravagant muſick. To which purpoſe
ſhee then alſo deſired her children to labour by all fair wayes to
take him off from that company, eſpecially from the frequentation
of Mr. <hi>Edward Jones;</hi> and that not ſo much out of diſlike to him as
to his wife, whom ſhee ſaw to be a ſubtil undermining woman,
that would be ready to make her own advantage of old Mr. <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wins</hi>
weakneſſe.</p>
            <p>I told you before, that the eldeſt ſon, <hi>Andrew Goodwin,</hi> was
upon his marriage taken into partnerſhip with his father, into a
Stock of Eighteen hundred pounds, of which two thirds are the
fathers, and one third the ſons, as by Indenture appears: which
partnerſhip is to continue eighteen years: a little before Mr. <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>win</hi>
had caſt up his eſtate, and found his neat ſtock to be two and
twenty hundred pounds, a fine competency; though nothing to
what he might have honeſtly raiſed out of his Trade (which for
the quantity, I verily believe to be one of the beſt Dyers trades
in England.) In this partnerſhip it was agreed that <hi>Andrew Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>win,</hi>
being the better accomptant, ſhould keep the books, and caſh,
and looke after the ſtreet buſineſſe, and old Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> to follow
the trade within doors; and ſo they began very comfortably toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
About three months after Mrs. <hi>Goodwins</hi> death, Mr. <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>win</hi>
going to ſee his ſon in Law and daughter <hi>Vernon,</hi> after ſome
abrupt paſſages, he began to tel them that his houſe wanted aguide,
and he had found a Godly woman that would be a fit wife for him;
this he pretends to deſire with much paſſion, when (as it now ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares)
he was ſent by Mrs. <hi>Jones</hi> and Mrs. <hi>Pigeon</hi> her ſiſter to
act this cheat to delude the world: which is plaine by what Mr.
<hi>Pigeon</hi> hath affirmed under his hand and ſeal. Which atteſtation
of Mr. <hi>Pigeons</hi> lyes depoſited in the hands of Mr. <hi>Cooper</hi> Miniſter,
and the Elders of the Pariſh of <hi>Olaves Southwarke;</hi> by which writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
he affirms that long before, even in the life time of Mrs. <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>win</hi>
deceaſed, Mr. <hi>Goowdin</hi> had engaged to marry Miſtris
<hi>Jones.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:112552:5"/>
But this pretended paſſion laſts not long, for within ten dayes af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> returnes againe to the houſe of his ſaid ſon in Law,
tels them, that he ſaw now that God had not appoynted this match
for him, but that God had provided for him a wife ſo eminent in
Piety and wiſdome, that his former wife deſerved not to be named
the ſame day. And when he was entreated by his ſaid children to
diſcover who this rare woman was, he utterly refuſed to reveale
it; yet his daily converſe and familiarity with Mrs <hi>Jones</hi> put them
in ſtrange thoughts; but ſtill the buſineſſe was to them but <hi>tanquam
Nubibus,</hi> very dark, till time the Mother of truth hath made it
more apparent and notorious, as by this enſuing diſcourſe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares.</p>
            <p>Let the Reader note, that Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> is a member of Mr.
<hi>Coopers</hi> Congregation, Mrs. <hi>Jones</hi> a member of Mr. <hi>Kiffins</hi>
Church, and Mrs <hi>Pigeon</hi> of Mr. <hi>Hanſard Knowles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now becauſe Mrs. <hi>Pigeon</hi> is the chief agent and contriver in theſe
ſinful projects, I ſhall give this brief diſcription of her: She is one that
can transforme her ſelf into an Angell of light, and having her
tongue tipt with Scripture, can with teares, ſighes, geſture at com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
ſet off what ſhe would have beleeved, as Goſpell, though very
falſe, thereby to enſure ſuch as hearken to her Charmes; no ſport to
her like catching credulous perſons with her faire Saint-like expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
making ſure prey of all that ſhe can thus draw into her
toyles; and ſo implacabe, that when ſhe hath once got an advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,
nothing ſhall ſatisfie her but the utmoſt rigour, which ſhe
will riſe at midnight to proſecure. This finely qualified Gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
was wife to Mr. <hi>Starkey</hi> an Apothecarie; but ſhe ſoone (as
is beleeved) woried him out of the world with her wicked impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
uſage; She had by him (as is thought) one childe, and a
faire eſtate. After a while ſhe marries with ſecond husband,
one Mr. <hi>Pigeon,</hi> a Lieutenant in the then Lieutenant Generall
<hi>Cromwells</hi> regiment. Shortly after her marriage with Mr. <hi>Pigeon,</hi>
ſhe returnes to her old imperious carriage, as will appeare by this
ſtory. She askes Mr. <hi>Pigeon</hi> what he would doe with his eſtate,
if he ſhould die? he ſayes, he hopes to have children by her; ſhe
replies, ſhe hopes he loves her ſo well that he will truſt her with his
children, and preſſes him to promiſe, that if he dye he will give her
all: he endeavours in a loving way to divert her; but ſhe inſiſts pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptorily
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:112552:5"/>
in her reſolution to make him ſweare to give her
all; which he ſtill refuſing, ſhe abſolutely refuſes to admit
him as a husband: and yet to worke him to her purpoſe, did
behave her ſelfe very amorouſly towards him, and beſides
her perſonall allurements did many times urge him to drinke
<hi>aqua coeleſtis, vinum viperatum</hi> compounded with provoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
drugs, and many other provocative meats and drinks
for many dayes together, promiſing him that if he would
ſweare as aforeſaid, ſhe would be to him according to his
owne heart: yet did he for good reaſons ſtill refuſe to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
and ſhe ſtill purſues him, till one morning practiſing the
very height of amorous behaviour towards him, and yet pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptorily
refuſing him, unleſſe he would ſwear, he fell into
ſuch a paſſion, and was ſo tranſported, that he became alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
ſenſeleſſe, feeble and irrationall, ſo that ſhe feared he
would never returne to his reaſon againe; in which conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
ſhe then beſought him for Chriſts ſake to ſpeak to her as
formerly: but all in vaine, for he was no wayes ſenſible of
what he ſaid or did. She now much affrighted at this ſtrange
accident, applies her ſelfe to one Doctor <hi>Burges</hi> a Phyſician,
who coming to him in that condition, gave him two vomits
in one day, which through exceſſive ſtraining brought him
even to the point of death: yet after being a little recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and his underſtanding ſomewhat returning, he beſought
God that he might regaine his underſtanding; which it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
God to reſtore him, though he remained a good ſpace
very feeble. In this condition he ſaid one day theſe words
to her, Sweet heart, thou haſt often told me that thy love
to me was greater then to thy former husband? didſt thou
ever deale by him after this manner? ſhe then terrified in
conſcience, ſaid indeed ſhe ſerved him ſo once, reſtraining him
her company ſo long till he committed a ſin, for which he
was tormented in his conſcience, and fell into ſuch an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gony
that as ſhe then ſaid, ſhe thought he would have dyed.
She then promiſed the ſaid Mr. <hi>Pigeon</hi> never to doe the like
again: ſhe ſaid, that by this carriage of hers ſhe procured of Mr.
<hi>Starky</hi> to give her all his eſtate except ſome trifling legacies,
and made no proviſion for his childe: yet at his death he
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:112552:6"/>
framed a new Will, wherein he otherwiſe diſpoſed of his
eſtate; which laſt Will ſhe found meanes to nullifie, by plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
that he dyed <hi>Non compos mentis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding all this, ſhe after a while returnes to her
old practiſes, and ſo wrought with Mr. <hi>Pigeon</hi> at the laſt, to
part with his eſtate to her, as is well known, and did yet after
this run away from him, and then againe after a while retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned;
and thus would ſhe frequently doe according as
the dictates of her unconſtant mind and her projects led
her.</p>
            <p>Now we muſt return to Miſtris <hi>Jones,</hi> whoſe turn muſt
now be ſerved. Shee muſt be freed from her husband, that
ſo ſhee may be free for old Mr. <hi>Goodwin,</hi> who is now ſo
taken with her, that he can enjoy himſelfe no where but in
her company: ſcarce one day in the week but he is at her houſe,
ſpending his time in dalliance with her. And Mr. <hi>Pigeon</hi>
affirms, that about the year 1646. ſojorning then in the
houſe of his Brother <hi>Jones,</hi> he ſet himſelfe to obſerve their
carriage, and at one time he ſaw Miſtris <hi>Jones</hi> take Mr. <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>win</hi>
about the neck and kiſs him: at another time, being (as
they thought) in private, he ſaw her take Mr. <hi>Goodwins</hi> hand,
and putting it under her apron, holding it againſt the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom
of her belly, with many repeated mutual kiſſes, ſhe ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
oh my deare Love! At which Mr. <hi>Pigeon</hi> being much
ſcandalized to ſee his Siſter <hi>Jones</hi> ſo behave her ſelf to Mr.
<hi>Goodwin,</hi> ſhe being a married woman, and her husband in
the houſe, went preſently and told his wife what he had
ſeen, and that he would tarry there no longer, for that he
believed the houſe was a Bawdy houſe, and that her Siſter
<hi>Jones</hi> was Mr. <hi>Goodwins</hi> whore. Miſtris <hi>Pigeon</hi> perceiving
they were diſcovered to her husband, told him then that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> was a Suiter to her Siſter <hi>Jones,</hi> and that ſhe
would make it a match. She then alſo told him that Mr. <hi>Jones</hi>
was no longer her ſiſters husband before God, but had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited
his right in her: ſhe then affirmed to him alſo, that
Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> of a long time had been a great friend to her ſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
and had given her ſeveral ſums of money, thirty pounds
at a time: All which paſſages Mr. <hi>Pigeon</hi> in preſence of good
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:112552:6"/>
witneſſes hath offered to make oath of before any Magiſtrate.</p>
            <p>Now the Lute and the Lute Maſter is quite laid aſide, Mr.
<hi>Goodwin</hi> ſpeaks not one word more of muſick; he hath found
another manner of Lute that is eaſier to play on, which he
had been long before a turning; And Mr. <hi>Pigeon</hi> having with
his eſtate diveſted himſelfe of his authority, muſt now ſeeme
to like of all his projecting wife doth, that ſo at any rate he
may buy his peace. He is (as I ſaid) entertained, and with
Mr. <hi>Knowles,</hi> called to counſell: Mr. <hi>Jones</hi> muſt now be
turned off, and to that purpoſe a writing is drawn by <hi>Knowles;</hi>
and having notice that Mr. <hi>Jones</hi> is at the Ram Inne in Smith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field
teaching a ſcholar on the Lute, <hi>Knowles</hi> comes up, askes
him if he be the man; which being acknowledged, he ſhews
him the bill of Divorce, and after that he had briefly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
him that he hath forfeited his intereſt in his wife,
bids him without more adoe ſet his hand and ſeale to the bill
of Divorce. Where note, that Mr. <hi>Jones,</hi> having lived 16 or
18 yeares in lawfull wedlock with his wife, by whom he hath
five children alive, yet upon the ſole information of his wife,
without any judiciall examination or proceſſe, muſt be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorced.
Mr. <hi>Jones</hi> aſtoniſhed at this ſtrange greeting, askes
him by what authority he could make divorces between man
and wife? but Mr. <hi>Knowles</hi> would not debate the matter, but
peremptorily bids him ſigne, or he would fetch authority
from the Counſell of State to compell him. Mr. <hi>Jones</hi> mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
at this inſolent language, tells him he would not ſubſcribe;
and that if he departed not ſpeedily, he would kick him down
ſtayres: away runs M. <hi>Knowles</hi> in a great fright to acquaint
his Clients with his ſucceſſe. Mr. <hi>Jones</hi> returning home, Mrs.
<hi>Pigeon</hi> falls to threatning of him. Mr. <hi>Jones,</hi> that could not
indure to be ſo abuſed in his owne houſe, bids her depart his
houſe; ſhe replies with inſolent language, and he replies to
her with kicks in the breech, and by force turnes her out of
doores preſently. She findes out Mr. <hi>Pigeon,</hi> who to be out
of the ſight of the wickedneſſe he dayly ſaw at his brother
<hi>Jones</hi> his houſe, had taken a chamber in Woodſtreet, where
he had often deſired his wife to remain with him; but ſhe
refuſed, and commands were now out of ſeaſon. Mrs. <hi>Pigeon</hi>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:112552:7"/>
coming as aforeſaid to her husband, aggravates with all her
cunning the violence Mr. <hi>Jones</hi> had done her. Mr. <hi>Pigeon,</hi>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hat was now throughly ſenſible of his wives inſolent behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,
and his brother <hi>Jones</hi> his being moſt injuriouſly dealt
withall, and all to gratifie a ſilly old man, and a covetous
naughty woman, tells his wife that he would not meddle in
the buſineſſe, and that he had often warned her to depart her
brother <hi>Jones</hi> his houſe, where there was no reaſon ſhe ſhould
abide againſt his conſent, to make breach between man and
wife. Away ſhe flings in a rage, and to be briefe, enters an
action againſt her brother <hi>Jones</hi> in her husbands name, though
without his conſent and knowledge, of 500l. and never reſts
untill ſhe have lodged Mr. <hi>Jones</hi> in the Counter: and this not
onely for revenge, but to mortifie him, and make him fit to
ſet his hand to the bill of Divorce, which at laſt he ſubmits
to, or to ſomething equivalent.</p>
            <p>About this time, whether for plotting or rejoycing I know
not, but there was a merry meeting at Mr. <hi>Pigeons.</hi> chamber,
Mrs. <hi>Pigeon</hi> and her good ſiſter <hi>Jones</hi> are come, and all waite
for Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> to paſſe away the time, Mrs. <hi>Pigeon</hi> falls a
jeering of her husband, who diſcontented at theſe doings was
walking too and fro in the chamber: ſiſter (quoth Mrs. <hi>Pigeon</hi>)
doth not my husband looke a little like my brother <hi>Jones?</hi> yes
indeed doth he, quoth ſhe; he prayes them to forbeare, and in
the meane time up comes old Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> with a fine white
capon under his arme: as he enters the roome, Mrs. <hi>Jones</hi>
flies to him, throwing her ſelfe into his armes, ſaying, Mr.
<hi>Goodwin,</hi> Mr. <hi>Jones</hi> and I am now parted for ever, and you
muſt keep me. The poore deluded old man being overjoyed,
takes her in his armes, tells her, it was the beſt newes to him
that ever came to towne, and that he would provide for her,
with more to that purpoſe. Mr. <hi>Pigeon</hi> ſtands in admiration
at theſe doings; at the laſt breaks out into theſe words; Now
quoth he, I ſee the cauſe my brother <hi>Jones</hi> was put into the
Counter: when Mrs. <hi>Pigeon,</hi> enraged at her husbands plaine
dealing, tells him he is as bad as his brother <hi>Jones,</hi> and therefore
takes his part; ſaying, <hi>you are, you are,</hi> many times over. Mrs.
<hi>Jones,</hi> in imitation of her ſiſter, and Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> in imitation
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:112552:7"/>
of his ſweet-heart Mrs. <hi>Jones,</hi> joyne with her in the ſame ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions,
with their fiſts bent againſt his face. Mr. <hi>Pigeon</hi>
overcome with their uncivill revilings, after ſeverall admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
to no purpoſe, was faine with ſome blowes to correct
their folly, and thruſt them all down ſtaires headlong. Mr.
<hi>Goodwin</hi> coming home to his houſe, where he had now been
a long time miſſing, and being by his neighbors demanded
where he got his black face, tells them, it was onely a violent
fit of the tooth ach; when as for ſome years before he had not
one tooth in his head, at leaſt viſible. And as miſchiefs
ſeldome come alone, ſhortly after this combate, as Mr.
<hi>Goodwin</hi> is coming from Mrs. <hi>Jones</hi> houſe to his owne, in the
dead of the night, he is againe aſſaulted in Bartholmew lane,
and grievouſly beaten: ſome ſay, it was Mr. <hi>Jones,</hi> ſome ſay Mr.
<hi>Pigeon;</hi> but by whom is not perfectly knowne: aſſoone as he
got quit of his enemy, in ſtead of going home to his owne fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily,
he returnes back to Mrs. <hi>Jones,</hi> well knowing in whoſe
quarrell he had received thoſe ſore buffetings: it was fit ſhe
ſhould ſee what a martyr he was for her ſake. There he lay
about ten dayes in a ſad condition, but the joy of Mrs. <hi>Jones</hi>
company made him forget his paine, and ſpeeded the cure,
which elſe might have been dangerous. Amongſt them, (to
ſalve his reputation) they give out, that a horſe had thrown
him downe, and trampled upon him.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Jones</hi> being now releaſed priſon, it is firſt agreed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
him and his late wife, that ſhe ſhall depart the houſe
and leave him with the children and goods; ſhe departs for a
fortnight into the country, at her returne (knowing his
houres of abſence) when he was abroad teaching his ſcholers,
ſhe comes privily in with her maid, a bold wench for her turn,
and ſecretly carries away all the beſt linnen and goods of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue,
leaving the poore man with all his children in an empty
houſe, and all this ſtill ſhe did to bring him to her owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions;
which were, that he ſhould depart the City, and ſo
leave her free to the embraces of old Mr. <hi>Goodwin.</hi> She long
before, with her ſiſter <hi>Pigeon,</hi> often ſolicited him to goe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
ſeas, alledging to him how bravely he might live there,
and what money he might get by his faculty of playing on
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:112552:8"/>
the Lute; which he would not hearken to then, but is now
compeld to depart the City, ſtript of wife, children, eſtate,
carrying away nothing but the bare clothes on his back, and
all to give place to an old mans luſt, and a naughtie womans
covetouſneſſe.</p>
            <p>Before his departure, he in private expoſtulates the matter
with Mr. <hi>Goodwin,</hi> askes him what wrong he had ever done
him, that he ſhould deale ſo perfidiouſly by him, to draw
his wife out of his boſome? and with what conſcience, and
by what law he could contract himſelfe to his wife, he being
yet alive? at the firſt the ſeduced old man denies it, but
having proved to him how he had ſundry times found
him kiſſing her, and at one time with his hand under her
apron, and that he had alſo by Will given her all, or the
greateſt part of his eſtate, which he could prove by the party
that drew the Will, the old man at laſt convinced, confeſſes the
Will, and the contract, adding, he might lawfully doe ſo, Mr.
<hi>Jones</hi> having (<hi>as he affirmed) forfeited his right as a husband to her.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here I muſt make a ſhort digreſſion, to informe the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
what ground Mrs. <hi>Jones</hi> alledges for her ſeparation from
her husband, which I received from Mr. <hi>Jones</hi> his mouth.</p>
            <p>Coming home one day, and finding his wife very fine, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to goe abroad, he askes her whither ſhe was going? ſhe
tells him to ſee ſuch a friend: He replies, wife, you know I
would not have you converſe with that woman. She tells
him violently ſhe would goe; he tells her, if ſhe goe, he will
never come in bed with her more, and this with ſome raſh aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeveration.</p>
            <p>Away ſhe goes, the poore man in much trouble, goes
abroad againe amongſt his ſcholers, and coming home at
night, findes his wife very ſtrange: when bed time came on,
thinking to goe to bed with his wife, ſhe bids him remember
his vow, which ſhe would take order he ſhould never break:
and ſo to this day would never more admit him as a husband.
Since ſhe gives out, that he hath committed folly, which ſhe
pretends ſhe can prove: for my part, I beleeve it a ſcandall
deviſed, the better to accompliſh her wicked project with Mr.
<hi>Goodwin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:112552:8"/>
But to returne; away goes Mr. <hi>Jones</hi> to Norwich, where
he hath ever ſince remained in very honeſt repute lamented
of all that heare his ſad ſtory.</p>
            <p>I told you before, that at his departure he left her all his
eſtate; amongſt other, he had a Leaſe of ſome houſes in St.
<hi>Johns</hi> ſtreet, worth about <hi>25l. per annum;</hi> he tells her, that
in reſpect ſhe keeps the children, he is content ſhe ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
this rent towards their maintenance; and accordingly
being now at Norwich, ſends the acquittances quarterly to
one Mr. <hi>Fletcher,</hi> a diſcreet freind of his, to deliver them to
Mrs. <hi>Jones:</hi> but ſhe refuſes them, goes to the tenants with old
Mr. <hi>Goodwin,</hi> and in her owne name demands the rent, offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
her acquittance for their diſcharge; which they refuſe
as inſufficient: yet at laſt yeeld to pay her, ſhe mentioning
in their acquittance, For the uſe of my husband <hi>Edward Jones:</hi>
but ſhe rather then by ſuch acquittances ſhe ſhould acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
Mr. <hi>Jones</hi> her husband, from whom ſhe now accounts
her ſelfe divorced, refuſeth; and ſo the rent for this foure
yeares hath layen dead in the tenants hands. Indeed ſhe hath
often threatned them, but when that would not prevaile, ſhe
let it reſt, well knowing Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> hath enough, whoſe
purſe is free to her uſe.</p>
            <p>Immediately before that Mr. <hi>Jones</hi> went away, that ſhe
might have a ſure intelligencer at Mr. <hi>Goodwins</hi> houſe, ſhe
puts her ſon, of about 14. yeares of age, under the colour of
a prentice to Mr. <hi>Goodwin,</hi> utterly againſt his fathers conſent,
who was very deſirous to have put the boy to ſome trade ſute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to his ſtrength, being a weak limbed childe: but ſhe was
violent, and would not neglect any meanes that might carry
on her project; ſhe and her ſiſter <hi>Pigeon</hi> were reſolved to come
in after themſelves, and therefore it was needfull (as theives
uſually doe) to thruſt in a little theife at the window to make
way for the great ones. This boy (being a flye youth) ſerves
for a little <hi>Mercurie,</hi> to carrie meſſages, appoint meetings, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray
the young man, and is frequently found behinde the
doore liſtning what paſſages paſſe between the old man and
his children, who perſwade him againſt theſe women, and
deſire him not to entertaine this boy, that was unſerviceable
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:112552:9"/>
for his trade? but all in vaine, for Mrs. <hi>Jones</hi> her will is a
Law, and now is Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> at her houſe night and day, at
rack and manger; all the towne rings of their ſcandalous
converſe: but he is ſo bewitched with her, that as it is reported
of leprous perſons, into whoſe fleſh you may thruſt needles
to the head, and they feele nothing; ſo though reproofe, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monitions,
prayers, from children, neighbours, Juſtices, Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters,
aſſault him daily, yet he is inſenſible of all.</p>
            <p>His owne Miniſter Mr. <hi>Cooper,</hi> a judicious, learned, ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-hearted
Chriſtian, labours much with him, ſets the ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall
notably before him; and at laſt thinking thereby to awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
him (all other meanes having proved uneffectuall) with
the conſent of the Elderſhip ſuſpends him from the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
which he values ſo little, that to this day he ſo conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues,
without ſo much as once deſiring to be reſtored, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing
his conſcience is cleare, and that he values the reproofs
of Miniſters no more then the dirt under his feet: Thus he goes
on from bad to worſe, and when he wants mony to ſupplie
Mrs. <hi>Jones</hi> and his owne irregular expences, he goes to the
merchants, takes up ſeverall ſummes of mony, 100l. at a
time, never acquaints his ſon, whoſe buſineſſe it was to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the debts, and ſo brings him into confuſion in his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compts:
at other times takes up ſtuffes upon credit, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
he cloaths Mrs. <hi>Jones</hi> and all her children, carries them
in coach out of the towne, there they revell for whole weeks
together, Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> payes all. Now theſe good ſiſters poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſe
him at their pleaſure, and plye him daily to beware of
his children, tell him what a ſhame it were for ſo wiſe a man
as he is to take counſell of his cradle, theſe are their very
words; and that his children would governe him as if he were
a very childe, when as they affirme to him, that there hath
not lived a wiſer man then he ſince King <hi>Solomon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus they cajole and inveagle a moſt pittifull weak man,
who is ſo taken with theſe diſſembling women, that he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts
it his greateſt preferment to waite upon them up and
downe the towne like a halfe-penny ſerving man, and when
he comes neare them, can ſcarce ſpeake for joy, and ſeldome
comes to them without ſome preſent for back or belly.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:112552:9"/>
A diſcreet friend of mine affirmed to me that he ſaw
one evening Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> going into <hi>Pauls</hi> ally; and that as
ſoone as he was entred, he ſaw the tranſported old man fall a
dancing, and capering, that he proteſted he thought he had
been diſtraught: The neighbours that have daily ſeene him
come into the ally, obſerve, that as ſoone as he is entred, he
falls a ſmiling; nor have they been wanting to reprove
them to their faces, telling Mrs. <hi>Jones,</hi> that it was a ſhame
they ſhould converſe ſo ſcandalouſly; but that the truth was,
he loved her for her ſmooth fleſh, and ſhe him for his full
purſe: the very children have taken notice of their behaviour.
A little girle of about foure yeares of age, daughter to one
Mr. <hi>Cherry,</hi> is ſent by her mother to Mrs. <hi>Jones</hi> of an errand;
at her returne ſhe tells her mother, old Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> is there,
and that ſhe ſaw him put up his hand under her ſmock ſleeve
up to her ſhoulders, playing and tickling her, when as modeſt
Mrs. <hi>Jones</hi> cryes, Away Mr. <hi>Goodwin,</hi> take away your hand, or
I will make you no more pye-ale: a maid ſervant to Mr.
<hi>Wright</hi> told me, that there was a voyce heard in their houſe,
ſaying, <hi>Mary Maſon,</hi> my ſiſter and I intend to lie abed to
morrow all the forenoone, if any body come, let in no body
into my chamber unleſſe it be honeſt Mr. <hi>Goodwin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now Mrs. <hi>Jones,</hi> that licks her lips at profit, not at the wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
old-mans kiſſes, caſts about how ſhe may make all yet
ſurer; now ſhe accounts all the old mans eſtate hers, and
therefore plots how ſhe may improve it, and prevent any diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointment
from his children; ſhe cauſes Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> to
ſend frequently to her his chiefe journyman, one <hi>Anthony
Rawlins,</hi> that all along had been <hi>Pimpe major</hi> to this villany;
he gives her account of the trade and cuſtome, how it is, and
how it might be managed: for theſe ſervices the old man lets
him filch what vailes he will: This knave ſeconds the old
mans report, that his ſon is an ill husband, that will bring all
to ruine: this allarmes Mrs. <hi>Jones,</hi> who hath now no viſible
ſubſiſtance but Mr. <hi>Goodwins</hi> eſtate; ſhe was, for ſome yeares
before her husbands departure a ſchoolemiſtris, teaching needle
workes, but he once gone, all that was preſently laid aſide.</p>
            <p>Here obſerve, that Mrs. <hi>Jones</hi> and her ſiſter have by this
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:112552:10"/>
time made all Mr. <hi>Goodwins</hi> family of their confederacy ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting
the young man, and his wife, and one <hi>Roger Crey,</hi>
the eldeſt prentiſe, an honeſt, religious, ſober fellow, that had
often ſpoken freely and heartily againſt their practiſes, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing
that theſe women would ruine the family.</p>
            <p>It pleaſed God that this fellow fell ſick, when preſently
the two ſiſters are ſent for, they phyſick him, he growes worſe;
young Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> intereats his father that ſome able Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
might be adviſed withall; the old man refuſes to give his
conſent, boaſting highly of the great skill of thoſe two ſhe.
Doctors: in Concluſion, the young man doubting ſome falſe
play, privately carries his water to an able Phyſician, Doctor
<hi>Burnet;</hi> at the firſt ſight of the water he tells him, the party
was a dead man, paſt all recovery; and that if good help
had been ſought in time, in all probability he might have done
well. Mr. <hi>Clarke</hi> a skilfull Apothecary on the Bridge is alſo
conſulted, and he affirmes the ſame. Still theſe women plye
him with their druggs, telling his Mr. there was no danger;
though he lies raging in the violence of a burning feaver, in
all probability cauſed by the contrary medicines they had
adminiſtred to him. The evening before his death, the two
ſiſters come in their hackney coach and make new applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to the poore departing man, who ſo long as he had his
ſenſes, had earneſtly beg'd of his Mr. that he might take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
that came from them, well knowing how they hated
him; yet never could obtaine any ſuccour but what came
from their hands: which what it was I leave to God and their
owne conſciences. In the beſt conſtruction that can be made,
they did very wickedly, to trifle away a mans life, being igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
of his diſeaſe; and in that conſideration, if no other, are
guilty of his bloud, which God will one day make inquiſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
for, and avenge. That night they ſate up in the hall with
a good fire and ale, to ſee what would become of him, and
about three of the clock he departed: when, whether terrified
with the guilt of what they had done, or what other conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration,
but preſently they tooke coach and departed, though
in the dead of the night. Some moneth after young Mrs. <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>win</hi>
dyed, a vertuous young woman, whoſe ſickneſſe occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:112552:10"/>
more viſits from theſe good Ladies, and might have done
more phyſick; but they were now out of credit, and her pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
watc'ht diligently that ſhe ſhould take nothing that
came from them. It is generally believed that ſhe dyed of
griefe, having her heart broke by the occaſion of the practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
of theſe women. In my hearing ſhe hath often made bitter
complaints, ſaying, theſe women had diſgraced the family, and
would be the ruine both of her husband and father in law.</p>
            <p>Now the project thrives apace, two of their great oppoſers
are by death removed out of the way, there remaines onely
the young man to be diſpoſſeſs'd, and then all is their own: in
order to which, they firſt order the old man to tell his ſon,
that his family wants a guide, and that he is reſolved to bring
Mrs. <hi>Jones</hi> to take charge of his family. The young man in a
great deal of diſtraction acquaints his friends with this newes,
and according to their advice, endeavours to perſwade his
father by faire meanes not to diſgrace the family by bringing
in a woman that was reported to be his whore; and ſeeing
his father perſiſt, that he would bring her in, tells him plainly
that he hath an intereſt both in the ſtock and trade, aſwell
as his father, and that ſeeing her coming in tends to the
ruine of both, he is reſolved to oppoſe it, and if ſhe comes,
to thruſt her out by head and ſhoulders. This the old man
reports back againe, and they are for the preſent at a loſſe.</p>
            <p>You may wonder that active Mrs. <hi>Pigeon</hi> hath been ſo little
mentioned all this while; but ſhe is not idle but hath her
irons in the fire, ſhe ſees how ſucceſſefully her ſiſter <hi>Jones</hi> with
a little of her help, hath rid her ſelfe of her husband, and
therefore now ſhe plots how to ſhake off alſo her ſhackles of
matrimony. You may remember that Mr. <hi>Pigeon,</hi> to ſatisfie
her violent importunity, had made over to her all his eſtate,
which was very great; well thinking by ſuch an unparalleld act
of love to binde her to him in duty and affection for ever;
but what can oblige ſuch ſavage natures? ſhe returnes to her
old diſobedience as before you have in part heard. It was a
common practiſe with her, if at any time he refuſed to act her
wicked projects, to run away from him ſometime for a week,
ſometime for a moneth: amongſt other of her devices, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:112552:11"/>
immediately after the late Kings death, ſhe makes ſhew
of much diſcontent againſt the actings of the preſent Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors;
ſhe projects to her husband to draw up a declaration
againſt them, and their proceedings, which he muſt ſubſcribe
and avow, and then he ſhould be her dear husband, and ſhe
vowes to ſtand by him to the laſt in it. Let others thinke their
pleaſure, for my part, I beleeve this was a plot laid to have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed
Mr. <hi>Pigeon;</hi> but he wiſely refuſed to act in it, repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
her pragmatical ſpirit, for which ſhe vowes to be revenged
of him: then Mr. <hi>Knowles</hi> is ſent for, who according to her
inſtructions had framed a bill of divorce, which he then per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded
Mr. <hi>Pigeon</hi> to ſubſcribe, alledging he might lawfully
in the ſight of God doe it, and at laſt did prevaile with him to
ſubſcribe. Not long after Mr. <hi>Pigeon</hi> is againe reconciled to
his wife, and Mrs. <hi>Pigeon</hi> did then alſo ſubſcribe two writings
with her hand and ſeale, which Mr. <hi>Pigeon</hi> hath ſtill by him,
wherein ſhe covenants to forget all former diſcord, and to
be to him a loving and dutifull wife; yet after this ſhe ran
away ſeverall times, and began now to fall into intimate ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance
with a merchant living at Clapham, from whoſe
company to this day Mr. <hi>Pigeon</hi> could never reclaime her:
Sometime ſhe would come and ſtay a week, and then to this
Merchant againe, and though Mr. <hi>Pigeon</hi> did before good
witneſſe upon the Exchange admoniſh the ſaid Merchant to
abandon her company, and gave him reaſons which did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
him to thinke that ſhe was the ſaid Merchants whore,
yet they ſtill perſiſt in their familiarity: now Mr. <hi>Pigeon</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
commanded into the Iſle of Jarſey, at his returne, his wife
being lately delivered, they were againe with much adoe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled,
yet was her old project ſtill on foot; for Mr. <hi>Pige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
having one night got cold by his carefull tending of the
childe, he ſaid to her, Sweet-heart, I fear I ſhall have the Gout,
for I have a paine in my wriſt that ſhoots into my finger; ſhe
preſently with violence affirmes, that it was the Pox: he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwades
her, and ſhe oppoſes, and at laſt reſolves to ſend for
Mr. <hi>Knowles</hi> to be adviſed by him. Mr. <hi>Pigeon</hi> the next day
meeting caſually Mr. <hi>Knowles,</hi> acquaints him with their diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
tells him if he will come and endeavour to perſwade
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:112552:11"/>
his wife to reaſon, he would take it kindely: Mr. <hi>Knowles</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies,
it was Mrs. <hi>Pigeons</hi> cuſtome firſt to reſolve upon things,
and then to aske counſell; and further ſaid to Mr. <hi>Pigeon,</hi>
that he need not thinke Mrs. <hi>Pigeon</hi> ſpent his money upon
him, for he had never received but five pounds for himſelfe,
and five ſhillings for the poore of their Congregation; he
ſaid, if Mr. <hi>Pigeon</hi> would be at home that evening, he would
come and endeavour to perſwade her; which accordingly he
did. Mrs. <hi>Pigeon</hi> conducts him into an upper chamber from
her husband, where they were together about halfe an houre,
and then came downe together into the roome where he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained;
and ſhe then began to make grievous complaints,
inſiſting chiefly on two heads, <hi>viz.</hi> that he had the Poxe, and
that ſhe was in feare of her life. He then asked her what
ground ſhe had for it, and if he had threatned her ſince he
came home? ſhe replied, he had not, but that he had a paine
in his arme, which ſhe knew was the Poxe. Mr. <hi>Knowles</hi>
ſaid, that he had a paine in his arme, and ſhe might aſwell
ſay ſo by him; and added, that ſhe was his wife, or elſe ſhe
was a whore. She ſtill inſiſts; ſhe was afraid, and could not
be ſatisfied. Mr. <hi>Pigeon</hi> mildely ſaid thus to Mr. <hi>Knowles,</hi> Sir,
you hold my wife too hard, ſhe pretends I have the Poxe; if
you thinke fit, we will preſently ſend for two able Phyſicians,
and I will ſubmit to a ſearch. Mr. <hi>Knowles</hi> replies, he ſpoke
fairely: yet ſeeing this would not ſatisfie, Mr. <hi>Knowles</hi> frames
a ſpeech in this manner, Mr. <hi>Pigeon,</hi> pray take my advice, and
goe from your wife, and I will warrant you ſhe will ſend for
you againe. Mr. <hi>Pigeon</hi> amazed at this advice, replies, God
hath given me counſell in his word, that <hi>every man ſhould have
his owne wife, and every woman her owne husband,</hi> to avoyd
evill; and I cannot leave Gods counſell to take yours. He
replies, in ſome caſes a man might leave his wife: Mr. <hi>Pige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
anſwers againe, there muſt be a joynt conſent of both
parties, and he being the chiefe cannot conſent. Mr. <hi>Knowles</hi>
againe and againe preſſes him to goe from her. Mr. <hi>Pigeon</hi>
tells him, I will not leave Gods counſell to take yours: and
if this be your counſell, pray depart the houſe.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Knowles</hi> preſently in diſcontent goes down the ſtayres.
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:112552:12"/>
Mrs. <hi>Pigeon</hi> endeavours to run after him, crying out, Mr.
<hi>Knowles, Take him with you, Take him with you.</hi> Mr. <hi>Pigeon</hi>
takes hold of his wifes skirt, and intreats her with all gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleneſſe
to be ruled; Mr. <hi>Knowles</hi> comes up the ſtairs againe,
layes violent hold of Mr. <hi>Pigeon,</hi> wringing him by the finger
to make him let goe his wiſe: but not ſo prevailing, (there
having not as yet paſt one blow) he layes down his Claoke,
and running to Mr. <hi>Pigeon,</hi> catches him by the throat, ſtirkes
twice at his face with his fiſt, calling him baſe unworthy fellow;
and ſtill ſorely pincht his throat. Then Mr. <hi>Pigeon</hi> by violence
throwes off Mr. <hi>Knowles,</hi> who feeling him too ſtrong for him,
runs down the ſtairs, calling to his aſſiſtance many rude per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
who violently laid hold of the ſaid Mr. <hi>Pigeon,</hi> his wife
taking part againſt him: Being thus invaded, he had no other
way but by violence; many ſtroaks lighted upon his wife:
and he profeſſeth that he was ſo tranſported by this ſtrange
provocation, that he can ſcarce give account of what he did,
untill he had quitted the room of theſe people: amongſt the
reſt, in this medly, Mrs. <hi>Pigeon</hi> hath got a ſtrange black face,
which by her art ſhe yet makes more viſible, and then with
Mr. <hi>Knowles</hi> and ſeveral other perſons, ſhe applyes her ſelf to
the then Lord General, ſcrewing her wits to the utmoſt to work
revenge: and in fine, ſo endeavoured with her ſmooth tongue,
that ſhe procured to have her ſaid husband diſmiſt the Army:
ſince which time ſhe hath lived in conſtant ſeparation from her
husband.</p>
            <p>Now is Miſtris <hi>Pigeons</hi> work done, and ſhe at leiſure to act
in her ſiſter <hi>Jones</hi> buſineſs, who (as I told you) was at a plunge,
by reaſon of the ſhort-anſwer young Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> had given
his Father. But Mrs. <hi>Pigeon,</hi> (to whom no villany is diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult)
relieves her: they preſently conclude upon this plot, Mr.
<hi>Goodwin</hi> hath a younger Son, <hi>James Goodwin,</hi> a weak head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
child, about ſeventeen years of age; him they get into
their Circle; and firſt they be labour the ſimple boy with their
ſophiſticated arguments, and gain him a proſelite to their ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nents:
now he is maillable. In brief, they preſently clap
up a Match between this boy, that a little before was inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
for a prentice, and Miſtris <hi>Jones</hi> her daughter, a girle
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:112552:12"/>
of about fifteen years old, but ſo ſmall, that ſhe looked
more like one of eight or nine at the moſt. After ſhort woo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
they are married together. This was a ſtrong ſubtil de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
worth Miſtris <hi>Pigeons</hi> Invention. By this match Mr.
<hi>Goodwin</hi> and his concubine are become brothers and ſiſters,
and who can find fault at decent familiaritie between ſuch?
By this the women have got an intereſt in the eſtate and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily,
that they dare own to the world, which they durſt not
before: This brings them boldly into the houſe to reſide;
Mrs. <hi>Jones</hi> pretending that becauſe her daughter is ſuch a
childe, ſhe hath the more need of a guide. In a word, this
device drawes a faire skin over a great many ſcabby places at
once; and ſo they without any more Ceremony all enter the
houſe, bringing all their children and retinue with them.</p>
            <p>Mrs. <hi>Pigeon</hi> is ſo taken with her policy, that at her firſt
arrival, walking alone up and downe the yard, ſhe was heard
to ſay to her ſelfe aloud, So, now I have broke the yce.
And now ſeeing the game ſo fair before her, ſhe reſolves to
have ſhare her ſelf: and therefore whereas before Mr. <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>win</hi>
had by Will given Mrs. <hi>Jones</hi> 1000l. Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
to Mr. <hi>Colborn,</hi> Mrs. <hi>Pigeons</hi> Secretary and faſt
friend, when a new Will is framed, by which he only gives
her 500l.</p>
            <p>Now they are ſetled with their families, and Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi>
is ſo raviſhed, that he hath got his brace of <hi>Mandlins</hi> ſo
neare him, that no ground can hold him. The only thing
that yet hinders, is, that Mr. <hi>Goodwins</hi> eldeſt ſon and part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
is ſtill in the houſe, and hath a clear intereſt in the Eſtate
and Tarde, and they have reſolved that nothing leſſe then all
ſhall ſatisfie their wicked appetites; in order to whoſe caſting
out, they had therefore ſome months before appointed the
old man to ſet an Accomptant of their own at work, to make
up all accompts between father and ſon, who by the inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
given him, had brought in the ballance or net ſtock, all
debts paid, to be 1516l. of which, as they order it, there
is coming to <hi>Andrew Goodwin</hi> for his third part, only 150l.
They give out that by his ill husbandry he hath
brought the eſtate to this; and that there was more aſſigned
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:112552:13"/>
him by the accompt then his due. Whereas it is conſtantly
beleeved by all the friends and neighbours, that for one ſhil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
the ſon hath waſted, the father hath waſted three; who
could not be accuſed of any other vice or unthriftineſſe, but
that when he ſaw his father would not be reclaimed from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe
with theſe wicked women, on whom he viſibly ſpent his
own and his ſons eſtate; when he ſaw that his father by taking
up money and wares in a diſorderly way had brought him into
confuſion in his accounts, and that his father in all places
where he came was ſo evill ſpoken of for his ſhamefull ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous
frequentation of theſe wicked women, unable to beare
up under ſuch a burden, he gave up himſelfe to melancholly
and careleſſe ſtupidity, that he let his bookes run into ſome
diſorder; of which (as you ſhall ſee) they make notable ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage.</p>
            <p>And therefore now Mrs. <hi>Pigeon</hi> aſſiſted with Mr. <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>win,</hi>
drawes up a note; which before witneſſe ſhe delivers
to young Mr. <hi>Goodwin,</hi> therewith charging him within four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
dayes to depart the houſe: which when he had peruſed,
he demanded of her, by what authority ſhe could warre him
out of his houſe? She replied, it would be his beſt way to depart
without diſpute, for as ſhe then told him, ſhe had never yet
undertaken any deſigne but ſhe brought it to perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
            <p>Preſently (in the young mans abſence) ſhe cauſes the
old man (who did nothing but by her order) to bring in a
Smith; him ſhe in old Mr. <hi>Goodwins</hi> name commands to break
open the young mans counting houſe, takes away all his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
and monies: from thence they aſcend to his chamber,
break open his trunke, take away what they pleaſe, and
while the young man amazed, is conſidering what to doe, the
fourteene dayes expire. They preſently in the old mans name
enter an action againſt him, and at one of the clock after
midnight they ſend forth their property <hi>James Goodwin</hi> to
fetch two bayliffes of the Borough, and two Sergeants which
they had prepared, and bring them over the ditch as theeves
into the houſe, where they finde the unnaturall old man with
theſe women waiting, who preſently ſet them to work: The
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:112552:13"/>
poore young man not dreaming of ſuch barbarous villany<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
was faſt aſleep in his bed. Having furniſhed them with an
iron crow, they all aſcend, and preſently fall to forcing open
his chamber doore: the young man awakened with the noyſe,
thinks no other but that it was theeves breaking in to murder
him, flyes to the window, cries out murder, and then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
ſets agreat cheſt againſt the door: which when they
could not force, the bayliffs being at a ſtand, Mrs. <hi>Pigeon,</hi>
(that gives all directions) Cryes, Mr. <hi>Goodwin,</hi> it is your
own houſe, you may bid them break down the wall: which
the ſimple old wretch bid them doe. The young man in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazement,
perceiving they had made a breach in the wall, and
having no weapon to defend himſelfe, and now ſeeing they
were Officers, ſuffers them to enter, and ſo they ſeize him,
violently haling him away in the dead of the night. Which
was thoſe ſubtil womens policie, fearing in the day time, had
they done this Diveliſh action, they might have been by the
neighbours throwne into the ditch headlong.</p>
            <p>Away goes the old man with Mrs. <hi>Pigeon</hi> to the Bridg
foot, where with the City Sergeants they waite the bayliffs,
who had promiſed to deliver him at the Bridg foot: But the
bayliffs, ſenſible that they had done that already which they
could not Juſtifie, would gratifie them no further, but carry
him priſoner to S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Margarets</hi> Hill.</p>
            <p>Young Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> in this diſtreſs, ſeeing all tending to
ruine, and that theſe women were reſolved to cozen father,
children, and creditors of all, bethinks himſelf of one <hi>Mr.
Henry Croſſe,</hi> to whom he owed 500l; to him he confeſſes a
Judgement, which Mr. <hi>Croſſe</hi> preſently executes, enters the
houſe, ſeizes the goods, and carries away to the value of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
1000l. to S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Margarets Hill.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now theſe cunning women are againe at a plunge, but Mr.
<hi>Colborne</hi> their ſure friend reſcues them: by his advice they
procure two Appraiſers, who are inſtructed, and appraiſe theſe
goods but at 403l. which money Mr. <hi>Colborne</hi> layes down,
being indeed <hi>Mrs. Pigeons</hi> money, having the mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
of all her eſtate. This money paid into the bayliffes
hands, the goods are releaſed, and returned to <hi>Mr. Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wins</hi>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:112552:14"/>
poſſeſſion. And now being attentive to all advantages,
finding they had been ſurprized by this Judgement, to ſtop
all gaps for the future, they fall upon a new deſigne to make
all ſure for ever. The old man muſt confeſs a Judgement
for all that he hath in the world; but to whom? This mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
could not be brought forth by women; <hi>Mr. Colborne</hi>
muſt be the man midwife; in ſhort, Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> confeſſes
a judgement, and Mrs. <hi>Pigeon</hi> having firſt turned the old
man and all his ſervants out of doors, ſhe before witneſs ſei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
of all for the uſe of Mr. <hi>Henry Colborne</hi> formally, and
for her ſelfe and Siſter <hi>Jones</hi> virtually.</p>
            <p>And now all is ſecure, and the plot they had been ſeven
years hatching is now perfected: as for the 403l depoſited
in the bayliffes hands, they find meanes by Mr. <hi>Colbornes</hi> help
to procure that: in regard young Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> hath but a
third ſhare in the ſtock, therefore Mr. <hi>Croſſe</hi> the Creditor
ſhall receive but the third of the 403l. ſeiſed, and ſo by or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of Court Mr. <hi>Croſſe</hi> receives his third, 134l, and the two
thirds return to Mr. <hi>Colborne.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus are Mr. <hi>Goodwin,</hi> Father and Son, brought to a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel
of bread, neither having one penny left. But Mr. <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>win</hi>
the father is taken into his late houſe, as a poor jorney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
to Mr. <hi>Colborne;</hi> and which is to amazement, ſo far
from being ſenſible of what he hath done, that he proclaims
to all comers that he had rather be Mrs. <hi>Pigeons</hi> Journy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
then to be Maſter of all without his two women.</p>
            <p>The young mans children being in the houſe, are turned
out of doors, and old Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> (by order of Mrs.
<hi>Pigeon</hi>) forbids all his children (the young traitor <hi>James
Goodwin</hi> excepted) to come upon the ground: His
daughter <hi>Vernon</hi> coming one day to ſee him, by Mrs. <hi>Pige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi>
command, he takes her by the arme, and thruſts her out
of doors: and now they inſult and vaunt beyond meaſure. Old
Mr. <hi>Goodwins</hi> children ſeeing all ruined, and that their father
is now captivated more then ever to theſe women, they joynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
preſent a petition to the Juſtices of the County and Borough
of South-wark, repreſenting therein their ſad condition; from
whom they obtain a warrant to bring theſe women before
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:112552:14"/>
them to S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Margarets Hill;</hi> where the buſineſs being debated,
Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> was ſeriouſly reproved and admoniſhed to
forſake the ſcandalous company of theſe women: but the
debate growing long, and it being late, the Juſtices adjourned
the meeting, and hearing of this buſineſs to the next week
after. When being againe met, and ſome new Juſtices that
had not heard the former debate, amongſt the reſt, Mr.
<hi>Gold</hi> of <hi>Clapham</hi> appeares, and is very eager in the vindicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of theſe women, eſpecially of Mrs. <hi>Pigeon,</hi> whom he ſaies
was a moſt Angelical woman, and that ſhe could diſcourſe
to admiration: and he ſaid that this proſecution of Mr. <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wins</hi>
children was but a rage of jealouſie for matter of eſtate,
and that the whole army of <hi>England</hi> ſhould maintaine the
reputation of theſe Gentlewomen: theſe were his words. Some
other of the Juſtices inſiſted to have Mr. <hi>Goodwins</hi> children
produce their proofs of what they had alledged in their peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
to which they replyed, their witneſſes were ready, but
would not appeare, unleſs they were ſummoned by order of
Law, left they ſhould incurr trouble from theſe Litigious
women; the Juſtices upon debate finding the witneſſes living
for the moſt part in Red Croſs Street, out of their Jurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to ſummon them, they diſmiſſed the buſineſs with only an
admonition to old Mr. <hi>Goodwin,</hi> to forſake the company of
theſe women ſo prejudicial to his reputation.</p>
            <p>Thus in all they proſpered: onely the ſeverall Churches to
which they are related, that knew their ſhifts, which were
now become very ſcandalous to their Congregations, after
ſeverall admonitions to them to forſake this ſcandalous ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
and all in vaine, they caſt them out of their Churches
and all communion with them. Since which time I cannot
learne that they owne any Church at all, but for the moſt
part ſpend the Sabbath at the Dye houſe.</p>

            <p>BEfore I conclude, I would lay a few conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
before you; though I have very little encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement,
you have with ſo much ſcorne rejected
the admonitions of godly Miniſters and others,
that it will be no wonder if all I can ſay make no impreſſion.
Yet who knowes not that the Inſtrument as well as the ſeaſon
is in Gods hand? And therefore I will now ſpeake my whole
heart to you, and I pray God ſet it home to your thoughts.
You are now arrived at old age, about ſixtie three, as I
gueſſe; the holy Ghoſt ſaith, <hi>Gray haires are a Crowne, if
they be found in the wayes of righteouſneſſe:</hi> and on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
that <hi>a ſinner of an hundred yeares old ſhall not eſcape
unpuniſhed;</hi> conſider then firſt, what God hath done for you,
what a wife did he bleſſe you withall, a woman for piety,
wiſdome, fidelity, frugality (I am confident) hardly to be
matcht, though your <hi>Dalilahs</hi> have ſought to aſperſe her;
but they doe but heave ſtones in the ayre, which will fall
on their owne heads: for while her body lies rotting in the
ground, her name yeelds a ſweet ſavour in the hearts of all
Gods people that knew her, while theſe ſtinke above ground.
And ſhe came not to you emptie handed, but brought you
a good eſtate, when you had little or nothing to take to; by
her God hath given you foure dutifull children, and ſo they
appeare to all that know them, though you moſt unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
call them wicked <hi>Chams</hi> and rebels:</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:112552:15"/>
For your daughter <hi>Vernon,</hi> name the time that ever ſhe
diſobeyed your lawfull commands; how many times hath
ſhe upon her knees beg'd of you to forſake the company of
theſe women, whoſe evill fame hath blaſted your former
good name? how many houres hath ſhe ſpent on her knees
in begging of God to open your eyes?</p>
            <p>For your ſon <hi>Andrew,</hi> how many men would have bin proud
of ſuch a ſon; though there were no more then his outward
ſhape? and never could be taxed for any miſcarriage till you
gave up your ſelfe wholly to company with theſe women,
who with all their art and malice have daily exaſperated you
againſt him: which behooved them to doe, well knowing
that he being your partner in Trade, there would be the leſs
hopes for them, while there remained any good Correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
between him and you: and when you were thus whetted,
you would come home and revile him with moſt unmanly
terms before all the boyes, enough to break a ſtronger
tempered ſpirit then his; and when you had ſo far dull'd and
ſotted him with this uſage, that you thought your project
ripe, then on the ſudden you take him by the throat like a
fellon or murderer: oh Mr. <hi>Goodwin,</hi> are theſe things true or
no? I appeale to your own conſcience; where were the bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els
of a father, when you let in the Marſhals men at midnight,
furniſhed them with iron bars, and accompanied with your
women, broke in upon him in his chamber, and ſcarce allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him time to put on his cloathes, dragd him to the jaile in
the dead of a cold winters night?</p>
            <p>For your ſecond ſon <hi>Thomas,</hi> an honeſt plain hearted man,
beloved of all that know him; and yet becauſe he will not
juſtifie you in your ſin againſt his own conſcience, but hath
in a dutifull manner beg'd of you to forſake theſe women,
you refuſe to owne him, and tell him you will never leave
him one penny.</p>
            <p>And for your third ſon <hi>James,</hi> you have done him the
greateſt wrong of all: for, that he might as a propertie be
inſtrumentall to your ſin, you have cauſed, or ſuffered your
women to poyſon his principles with their corrupt tenents;
you have betraid him yet a childe, and moſt ſhamefully unfit
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:112552:16"/>
for ſuch a relation, to marriage with the daughter of her, that
hath ruined your name and eſtate.</p>
            <p>Thus in particular have you wronged all your children, and
in general by making over all your eſtate, which by the Law
of God and nature ought to have deſcended after your deceaſe
to them, to Mr. <hi>Colborne.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, that <hi>the good man is merciful to his beaſt:</hi>
and Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> (whom his women affirm is as wiſe as <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi>)
is unmerciful to his owne children. The Apoſtle
ſaith, <hi>No man hates his own fleſh</hi> are you (Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi>) no man?
or will you make the holy Ghoſt a liar? And what hath been
the incentive to all this unnatural dealing? your love, or
your luſt to Mrs. <hi>Jones;</hi> you can name no other; that you
might enjoy her, another mans wife, her husband alive. You
have ſtifled your conſcience, ſcandalized the Goſpel, reviled
Gods Miniſters, ſuffered your ſelfe to be cut off from the
Sacrament and Communion with the Church of God, ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ined
all your children, and baſely requited your vertuous
wife deceaſed: and all this to gratifie two ſinful women, that
now they have obteined their ends, begin to ſlight you, and
no doubt when through the infirmities of old age you ſhall be
able to doe them no more druggery, will caſt you off and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
you to want and miſery. This all the world foreſees;
for women of their profeſſion doe alwayes ſo. Did not Mrs.
<hi>Pigeon,</hi> when ſhe had ſtript her husband of all he had, caſt
him off, though formerly her dear husband? Be yet perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
your children would yet rejoyce in you, and care for
you, though ſtript of all your eſtate by theſe women. Doe
you not perceive how they have enſnared you, and wound
you about with their nets, as the ſpider doth the ſilly fly? firſt,
they entangled you with muſick, and many yeares held you
under that pleaſing note; then they caſt over you the net of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
piety, and fained extraordinary holyneſs; and then
they ſnare you in the net of love to Mrs. <hi>Jones,</hi> which they
work you to believe is lawful; and laſtly, leſt you ſhould
break from all theſe, they throw over you the ſtrong iron net
of the Law, and that doubtleſs will hold your eſtate faſt,
which is the thing they ſeeke for, whatever becomes of
you.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:112552:16"/>
I ſhall conclude all with a ſhort paraphraſe upon part

            <p>
               <hi>Verſe</hi> 11. Shee is babling and loud, whoſe feete cannot

            <p>12. Now ſhe is without, now in the ſtreets, and lies in waite
at every corner.</p>
            <p>This is ſo perfectly Mrs. <hi>Jones</hi> her picture, that nothing
can be more alike in all the circumſtances.</p>
            <p>13. So ſhe caught him, and kiſſed him, and with an impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent

            <p>16. I have deck't my bed with ornaments, carpets and

            <p>19. For my husband is not at home; he is gone a journey

            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:112552:17"/>
I have ſent him to <hi>Norwich,</hi> whither he is forced by my

            <p>20. Hee hath taken with him a bag of Silver, and will return
at the day appointed.</p>
            <p>I have ſtript him of all, not leaving him one penny in his
purſe; and taken order if ever he returne, to have him clapt
up in the jayle. Judg what a Saint the harlot is in theſe four

lets him carry away a bag of money, and expects his
returne.</p>
            <p>21. Thus with her great craft ſhe cauſed him to yeeld, and
with her flattring lips ſhe entiſed him.</p>
            <p>22. And he followed her ſtraightway as an ox that goes
to the ſlaughter, and as a fool to the correction of the ſtocks.</p>
            <p>23. Till a dart ſtrike through his liver, as a bird haſtes to

            <p>NOT that I have any confidence to prevaile with you
by any thing I can ſay, but that you may be warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and left without excuſe: I am not ignorant of
your diſpoſitions, ſcoffing at any thing that croſſes

in ſin, that becauſe with painted words, elevated, and then
preſently dejected Eyes, that ſend forth teares at command,
double ſighes, and broken ſobs; ſolemne Imprecations to
what you would aſſert, promptneſſe to rebuke ſinfull expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
or behaviour in others, when there are ſuch perſons by
as may witneſſe your zeale; ſeemingly great tenderneſſe and
ſcrupuloſity in ſmaller matters, readineſſe to quote abuſed
Scripture for all you doe; in all which you are incomparably
practiſed; becauſe with theſe you have not onely charmed a
weak old man; but even many ſeeming wiſe perſons (not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with your ſubtilties) are deluded by you, ſo
that ſome of them have ſtiled you moſt angelicall Creatures.
I ſay, having theſe abilities and applauſes, I much doubt you
beleeve alſo that even God himſelfe allowes of all you have
done. But let me whiſper a word to your conſciences, if you have
any. I paſs by here what you have done to your reſpective hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands,
and divers other perſons I could name. I will only
put you in minde what you have to anſwer for poor old Mr.
<hi>Goodwin,</hi> and his children, all whom (for your covetous
ſinful ends) you have ruined; ſome of them by your meanes
brought already to a morſel of bread. Was there ever ſuch a

deſolation brought upon a family, to inrich thoſe that lately
had not the leaſt title, or intereſt in the family? That Mr.
<hi>Goodwin</hi> (father and ſon) that ſix yeares a gone lived in good
credit, and with a good ſtock, and a gaineful trade, through
your injurious invaſions and ſubtil ſleights, are neither of
them at this day worth a groat: the whole Eſtate, houſe,
ſtock, and Trade under the covert of Mr. <hi>Colbornes</hi> name,
being tranſlated to you. Nay, by the induſtry of Mr. <hi>Colborne</hi>
the Scrivener, and Mr. <hi>Hat</hi> the Attorney, you enjoy all this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
a Legal title; ſo that thus fortified, you triumph and laugh
at all that dare oppoſe you, and you are now fixed in your
ſinful purchaſe. But here Remember, though man cannot
call you to accompt, God will; and by how much the more
religion hath been a cloake to this wickedneſſe, by ſo much
the more ſevere and dreadful is your puniſhment like to be.
And though Mrs. <hi>Pigeon</hi> ſayes, I never took any deſigne in
hand but I proſpered in it; yet let her remember, that Gods
word ſayes, <hi>The proſperity of the wicked ſhall ſlay them:</hi> let
them both remember, that while the thief ſteales, the Hemp
growes; that while ſin ripens, the reckoning day comes on
apace: that while they are revelling with their Sage-ale,
and Marmalade, and dividing the ſpoyles of Mr. <hi>Goodwins</hi>
eſtate, his children are ſpreading their wrongs daily before
God, to whom they appeale for Juſtice againſt you, and to
whoſe dreadful barr they ſummon you both, with your aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants,

            <p>I Am informed, That theſe women, taking the advantage
of the Authors not publiſhing his name, give out, that
all is lies and ſlanders. In the firſt place conſider, if it
be not reaſonable in perillous times to beware of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rillous

matter of Fact: Of the truth whereof, if thou wilt be at the

Mr. <hi>Wolf</hi> a Shop-keeper upon Exchange: of Mrs. <hi>Jones</hi> her

neighbors on the Green-bank. In fine, that there may not
want Teſtimonies, even theſe women have ſet to their Seal:
For inſtance, take this ſhort, but real ſtory. In <hi>page</hi> 28. of
the Narrative, there is a ſhort parallel made between Mrs.
<hi>Jones</hi> and the Harlot, in <hi>Prov.</hi> 7. 20. is this Note, <hi>I have
ſtript him of all, not leaving him one penny in his purſe, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:112552:19"/>
order if ever he returne, to have him clapt up in the Gaol.</hi>
This was printed above three Months agone, and about a
month agone comes Mr. <hi>Jones</hi> to <hi>London,</hi> his buſineſſe, to
ſee his children, and to receive and ſettle the rents in <hi>St. Johns</hi>
ſtreet, which is well known he intended to divide every pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
amongſt his children: at his arrival being conſtrained in
his affections, he went to his houſe to ſee them, where hee
found one of Mr. <hi>Goodwins</hi> ſervants called <hi>Silveſter Smith,</hi> a
Gentlemans Son of Eſtate in <hi>Nottinghamſhire,</hi> courting
his daughter <hi>Mary Jones,</hi> a Girle about thirteen years of age,
with whom the ſaid <hi>Silveſter</hi> is ſince contracted in marriage.
Where note how theſe wicked women do wind and ſcrew
themſelves into good families, as formerly they did by <hi>James
Goodwin,</hi> and the elder ſiſter, though both were children,
and ſhamefully unfit for ſuch a relation: and their deſigne
herein not ſo much to prefer theſe children, as to become in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſted
in the eſtates of other men. But to returne, while
Mr. <hi>Jones</hi> in a civil loving way is diſcourſing with them, Mrs.
<hi>Jones</hi> and Mrs. <hi>Pigeon</hi> both in the houſe, ſent and entered an
Action for 400 l. againſt Mr. <hi>Jones</hi> in <hi>Wood. ſtreet</hi> Counter, at
the pretended Suit of one Mr. <hi>Mountague</hi> a School-maſter of
<hi>Ockingham</hi> in <hi>Barkſhire,</hi> and brought away two Sergeants,
who at his coming down arreſted him, and carried him away
Priſoner to the Counter. The next morning one of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geants
went to theſe women (as I conceive) to demand his
Salary: when Mrs. <hi>Jones</hi> asked of him, if Mr. <hi>Jones</hi> were in
the priſon; and being informed he was, ſhe then fell into a
violent Crocodile paſſion, with tears bewailing his condition:
The Sergeant then told her, he was there by her order, and
that if ſhe would withdraw the Action, he would preſently
releaſe him: ſhe then cryed out with vehemency, Oh no, by
no means; he muſt lye in priſon, and we have more Actions
to charge him with. Away in admiration of this diveliſh
diſſimulation comes the Sergeant, and at his heels Mrs. <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon</hi>
to the Counter, and in the names of ſeveral perſons en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
four Actions more againſt him, to the value in all of
about 1000 l. of all which Mr. <hi>Jones</hi> proteſts he oweth not
one penny. Since they have let fall the four laſt Actions, and
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:112552:19"/>
did on <hi>Wedneſday, February the</hi> 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> come to a Tryal upon the
400 l. Action. But firſt Mrs. <hi>Jones</hi> is diſpatcht away to <hi>Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kingham</hi>
to prevail with Mr. <hi>Mountague</hi> to own it, who (as
is verily believed) all this while knew nothing of it: which
they well hope ſhe cannot fail to effect, his wife being alſo
ſiſter to theſe good Ladies, a chicken of the ſame brood.
Things thus diſpoſed, to tryal they come, where when Mrs.
<hi>Pigeons</hi> Counſel (Mr. <hi>Lane</hi>) told her it was not probable Mr.
<hi>Jones</hi> ſhould owe Mr. <hi>Mountague,</hi> 400 l. and he have nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Bill nor Bond to ſhew for it; and though ſhe offered to
make Oath of it, he told her that would not carry it; but
wiſh'd her rather, if ſhe could ſwear that Mr. <hi>Mountague</hi>
had disburſed any money for Mrs. <hi>Jones</hi> and her children
ſince his abſence: ſhe then, <hi>ad omnia quare,</hi> made Oath that
Mr. <hi>Jones</hi> ran away from her ſiſter five years agone, leaving
her neither bread, nor money to buy bread: though it can be
proved, they were two years at leaſt ſolliciting him to be gon
from his wife, and at one time offered him 10 l. to be gone,
and all that they might carry on their intended project with
old Mr. <hi>Goodwin.</hi> But to make ſhort, by this Oath ſhe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
a Verdict for 60 l. for Mr. <hi>Mountague,</hi> which Mr. <hi>Jones</hi>
not any wayes able to pay, muſt remaine priſoner in all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability
during life: which conſidering his melancholly tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
impatient of a Priſon, I verily believe will not be long. And
now let the ingenuous Reader judg of the fidelity of the Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative,
and the wickedneſs of theſe women.</p>
