            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the Gospell after S. Matthewe (right hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, and my very good Lorde) oure Sauioure Christ teacheth vs most notably, how to knowe and discerne false Prophetes, from such as bee the true Pastours, &amp; Ambassadours of Iesus Christ: when he saith, They shall come vnto you in sheepes clothing, but inwardly they are rauening wolues, you shal know the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by their fruites. Then if the fruites of conuersation bee the ensignes, the badges, and cognizances to know false Prophets by (as our sauiour sayth they are) the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> surely may we iudge, nay certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perswade our selues that the Papistes are those false Prophets, Apostataes, and seducers
<pb facs="tcp:27969:3"/>
which the word of God speaketh of: as in the further discourse of this booke shall manifestly appeare: for not only do their works &amp; fruits conuince them heereof, but also their false, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditious erronious, and heretical doctrine doth argue the same. But they will easilye wipe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way this blot: and saye that we are those false Prophets of whom Christ speaketh of. To whom I answeare, let their workes, and doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine bee compared to ours, and bothe pey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed in the equall ballance of Gods worde (the onely touchstone to trie all controuersies by) and then shall it easilye appeare whether they or wee are the false Prophetes. Doe not they come vnto vs in sheeps cloathing, I meane in suche habite as portendeth all kinde of auste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, humilitie, and holinesse of life outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye: as namelye, in their Surplesses, Copes, Tippets, forked Cappes, Miters, Hattes, Cro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siers, Hoodes, Cowles, Tunicles, Sandals, Shirtes of hayre, and a thousande other like playerlike garmentes? yea and doe they not teache that all holinesse consisteth in these ragges? Is not this to come in sheepes cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing? But they will obiect, if thys bee so, why doe you weare some of these garmentes? I aunsweare, wee haue some of them in deede
<pb facs="tcp:27969:3"/>
but that is vppon sufferaunce and permission onely, not vppon constrainte or necessitie as theirs are. Besides, ours is commaunded by a Christian Queene, and therefore lawefull, theirs by Antichriste, and therefore vnlawfull. Againe we vse them as things indifferent they as things of necessitie, we repose no religion in them, they relye holy vpon them.</p>
            <p>And for theyr doctrine, it is so erronious, so corrupte, so seditious, nay so blasphemous, and Sacrilegious, that it would greeue a Christian manne to thinke of it: As Prayer for the dead, Iustification by good works, Purgatorie, <hi>Lim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bo Patrum,</hi> Inhere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t Rightuousnesse, Inuoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to Saincts, Transubstantiation, Adoration of Images, their seuen cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>terfait Sacramentes extreeme vnctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, christening of Bels, hallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of churches &amp; churchyardes, makinge of holy bread, holy water, Auricular confesion, shrift, pena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, absolutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, masse, matte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, diriges, Lady Psalters, tapers, candles, bedes censings, ringings, perfuminges, &amp; legions of like tru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, which the word of God knoweth not: of al which pointes of doctrin of theirs I wil in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat in a book by it self god willing very short<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly, wherin shal appeare whether they or we haue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> truth. This is their godly doctrin which
<pb facs="tcp:27969:4"/>
ther it com nerer to the word of God, or ours, let the world iudge. And yet notwithstanding they set a faire face on it, they stamp and stare, &amp; beare the world in hand, that theirs is the truth. For say they, our doctrine standeth vpon sure pillers, antiquitie, vniuersalitie, generalitie &amp; the like. Our doctrine is proued by discent of Bishops from time to time, by consent of all nations and so foorth, but your doctrine is newe and starte vppe the laste day, &amp;c. But whether theirs or ours bee the newer it shall appeare in the discourse following. First wee are able to proue that our doctrine is auncien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then theirs, ye as auncient as God himselfe whose truth it is. And first to begin with the diuine institution in Paradice: wee reade that God the father gaue vnto Adam his word &amp; commandement, to wit: Thou shalt not eat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> of the tree of knowledge of good and euil, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grauing, and as it were imprinting, this word &amp; commandement in the heart of Adam, and in him, in all his posteritie. By the which lawe, of conscience then liued almost 2000. yeeres without any other law or word written, being guided &amp; directed by the holy Ghost in all their actions: the 2000. yeares being ended, &amp; men waxing dissolute, licentious &amp; wicked, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:27969:4"/>
Lorde (as <hi>Theophilactus</hi> witnesseth) disday<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to speake to them any longer by his spirit for that they became wicked, gaue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a Lawe, (for before they hadde no written Lawe, God appearing to them I meane the fathers and Patryarches, in visions in apparitions, in dreames, sometime in the forme of angels, &amp; waifaring men, sometime in one shape, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time in an other, according as their weakenesse could beare) written by the finger of God in two tables of stone, which is the x. commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements. Then Moses at the commandement of God committing to writing, the x. com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements with his other fiue books, as he was taughte and directed by the suggestion of the spirit of God, ruled the Israelites thereby. The old testament being thus written by the seruant of God Moses, &amp; his faithful prophets at the commandement of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> continued in force til the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming of Christ, which was in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ffect 2000. yeeres after. The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> our sauiour Iesus Christ, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming in the flesh, gaue in comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement to his Euangelists, Apostles, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets to write the new testame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, which they, by the direction of gods spirit, did most happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perform. These 2. testaments now, the old &amp; the new God be tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ked, we haue. Now let the
<pb facs="tcp:27969:5"/>
papists disproue this if they can, or if they haue any other Gospell, let the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> bring it forth: They ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not deny, but we haue the same word of god which God the father, our sauiour Christe &amp; the holy ghost haue giuen to the woorlde: &amp; this being graunted, it must needs folow, that our doctrine is true, &amp; theirs most false Now let them deriue their antichristian doctrine li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neally from suche antiquitie, &amp; truth as this, if they can: but that they shall neuer bee able to do. For their doctrine hath bin longer in pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, then Solomons temple was in building. Yea within these x or xii. hundred yeeres, there was not a scrap of their pesteferous doctrine coyned: no the egg was not the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> laid that hat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched that poisoned Cocatrice. Then the truth of gods word throgh the iniquitie of time, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning by little &amp; little to suffer eclipse, at the last sprang vp such mountaines of heresies, &amp; corruptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, cast out of the bottomles pit, &amp; as it were spewed out of the Diuels mouth, that the truth was altogether obscured.</p>
            <p>Then Antichrist the pope sprong vp challen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging superioritie ouer all the face of the earth, and he begun the Romish religion, &amp; so euery one succeeding him put to somwhat yea euery Frier, Monk, Abbot, Prior, Prouost, parson, Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>car,
<pb facs="tcp:27969:5"/>
Cardinal, and euen al in general added to it, euery one a patch. So that the papists religi- (if it may bee called a Religion) is nothing els than the shreddes, the peeces and patches, the drosse &amp; dregs of corruptible me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: &amp; ours the doctrine of the holy ghost. But although that it could not be proued that our doctrine is au<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cienter then theirs, yet the truth of the same dependeth not vpon the antiquity. For Christ saith in the Gospel, <hi>Ego sum via, veritas &amp; vita</hi>: I am the way, the truth, and the life. He saith not, I am custome, I am antiquity. And therfore I say <hi>Antiquitas sine veritate est vetustas erroris</hi>: Antiquity without truth, is the au<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cient of error. Custome, nor antiquity ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not make that true, whiche in the beginning was false: neither can the nouelties, or newnes of anye thing make that faise, which of it selfe is true. Hereby it is manifest, that the papistes doctrin is a doctrine of noueltie (I had almost said of diuilry) and ours a doctrine of al aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entnes the auncientest: and yet wold they car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry awaye the truth with a counterfeit shew of antiquitie. And whereas also they depend so much vpon vniuersality forsooth, god be than<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ked, their doctrin is not so vniuersal, as they make fare of. For if <hi>y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
               </hi> nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that haue
<pb facs="tcp:27969:6"/>
receiued it bee compared to the number of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that haue not receiued it, they shal seeme not to bee one for a thousande, naye not one for ten thousand. For all the Easte churche neuer receyued his doctrine, the Greeke Church neuer admitted it. The greatest parte of Italy, of Frau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, of Flau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ders, Rushia, Musco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uia, Denmarke, England, Scotland, Ireland, and many other countries besides, haue vtterly cast off his Antichristian yoke &amp; vsurped gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And therefore is not his doctrine so v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niuersal as he wold perswade the world. But they will saye, who shal be iudge of the truthe of our and your Doctrine betwixt vs, I aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sweare, the word of God according to this say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our sauiour Christ. <hi>Verbum quod ego predicaui vobis iudicabit nouissimo die:</hi> The woorde that I haue preached vnto you, shall iudge in the last daye.</p>
            <p>But to leaue their doctrine, and to come to their liues<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it is obiected, they liue well, and are plentifuller in good works then we, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their doctrine and their faithe is the truth. I aunswere there is a <hi>non sequitur</hi> or rather a mere <hi>Fallax</hi> in this argument, for good works before the world is one thing, &amp; good workes before God is another. Those
<pb facs="tcp:27969:6"/>
which in the eies of the worlde seeme to bee good works, may be before god most filthy &amp; abhominable: except they spring out of a liue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly faith it is vnpossible they shuld please God, as Paule sayeth. The Iewes, the Turkes, the Paganes, and Infidels doe good workes out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly (as it shoulde seeme) but because they are wythout Faith, they please not God. And euen suche are our Papystes good woorks: if they may be called, Good works, and not ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Ciuilia opera</hi> Ciuel woorkes or woorks of office, which the Diuelles them selues may doe. Besides this, if they doe any good workes, they are most detestable and lothsome before God, because they seeke to be iustified and saued by them, yea to merite heauen, &amp; to make God greatly indebted and beholden vnto them. And therefore I conclude that the papists although they do neuer so many good works outwardly, yet are they but hypocriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, and no true good woorkes indeed. They erre in the nature of good works also: for those wherevpon the Lorde hath set his seale and brande of curse and malediction for euer, they call good workes: as namely the building and erecting of Abbeies, nunneries, priories mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasteries, &amp; other religious houses, guilding
