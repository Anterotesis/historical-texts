            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Concerning the

            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Find from my <hi>Socinian</hi> Adversary, <hi>Observati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi>
(as he calls it) <hi>on my Four Letters;</hi> (He
might have said <hi>Five,</hi> if he pleased.) Which
I saw not till Yesterday, <hi>Mar.</hi> 13. Nor do I
see any great need of publishing a hasty An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer.
There being so little in it that deserves an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,
which had not been answered before it was
written. And I may perhaps ere long meet with
some such like <hi>Observations</hi> upon my <hi>Fifth;</hi> and then
I may at once Answer both.</p>
            <p>His first head he calls <hi>The Design of the Letters.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That which I undertook to maintain, was clearly
stated thus, That <hi>it is not Inconsistent with natural
Reason, that there may be Three Somewhats which are
but One God; And that what in one regard are Three,
may in another regard be One.</hi> To prove this (and this
only) I brought those Arguments or Instances at
which he cavils.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:56320:3"/>
               <hi>This he now tells me (p. 4.)</hi> The Socinians will
grant me this. <hi>(That is, they grant what I undertook
to prove.) And</hi> of which, <hi>he says,</hi> no Man ever was
so foolish as to doubt. <hi>And my</hi> Arian <hi>Adversary in like
manner, (in his</hi> Answer, <hi>p. 3. and his</hi> Vindication, <hi>p.
3, 5.) that</hi> none but a Madman would ever deny it. <hi>And
that</hi> he cannot say, there is any Contradiction in saying,
there may be three Persons in God. <hi>Thus far therefore
we are agreed on all hands.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But he now tells me, p. 4. That <hi>this is not the
Question.</hi> Yes; this is the Question that I undertook.
'Tis true, there be other Questions between us and
the <hi>Socinians.</hi> But <hi>the Question I undertook</hi> was that.
And he knows it was so.</p>
            <p>Well; but what says he, is the Question? 'Tis
this he says (p. 4.) <hi>Whether there be Three Gods, or
but One God.</hi> No: this is not the Question. For in
this we are agreed also. <hi>The Socinians</hi> (he says) <hi>affirm
There is but One God.</hi> And so do I.</p>
            <p>The Proposition, <hi>he says,</hi> which (in favour of the
Trinity) I should have proved, <hi>(that is, the task he sets
me, not what I undertook) was this,</hi> That what are
in one regard Three, may in another regard be SO One,
that all of them (together) are but One, and yet each of
them (singly, and by it self) is that One.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Now, I think, I had proved this; This</hi> corpus lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gum,
corpus latum, <hi>and</hi> corpus profundum, <hi>is</hi> One Cube.
<hi>The</hi> corpus longum <hi>is a</hi> Cube; <hi>the</hi> corpus latum <hi>is a</hi> Cube,
<hi>and the</hi> corpus profundum <hi>is a</hi> Cube: <hi>and yet this</hi> Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus
longum, latum &amp; profundum, <hi>is</hi> (altogether) <hi>but</hi>
One Cube.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But this is Latin: And his Challenge is, (p. 5.)</hi>
Shew me that Trinitarian that dares dispute the Question
in plain English. <hi>I'll endeavour that too.</hi> David
the Son of Iesse <hi>was a</hi> Man; <hi>and</hi> David King of Israel
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:56320:3"/>
               <hi>was a</hi> Man; <hi>and</hi> David the Father of Solomon <hi>was a</hi> Man:
<hi>Yet</hi> David the Son of Iesse, the King of Israel, and Father
of Solomon, <hi>was (altogether) but</hi> One Man. <hi>And this is</hi>
plain English, <hi>without the words of</hi> Abstract, Concrete, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity,
Personality, <hi>(at which he there cavils,) or other
hard words than what his</hi> Tankard-bearer <hi>might under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Well but (says he)</hi> We may indeed say, This long body
is a Cube, meaning thereby, This long body, which is also
broad and high, is a Cube; and if it were not broad and high
it were not a Cube: But we cannot say so here. <hi>I'll try if I
cannot hit this too. The</hi> All-wise God, <hi>is</hi> God All-suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent;
<hi>the</hi> Almighty God, <hi>is</hi> God All-sufficient; <hi>the</hi> Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
God, <hi>is</hi> God All-sufficient: <hi>meaning by</hi> the All-wise
God, <hi>the God who is also</hi> Almighty <hi>and</hi> Everlasting; <hi>and
if he were not also</hi> Almighty and Everlasting, <hi>he were not</hi>
All-sufficient. <hi>Yet this</hi> All-wise, Almighty, and Everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
God, <hi>is (altogether) but</hi> One God All-sufficient.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But supposing</hi> (says he) <hi>the Doctor's Instances do satisfy
this difficulty,</hi> (as I think they do;) <hi>Does he not know there
are many more,</hi> (Yes, he doth know it) <hi>to which these In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
are not applicable?</hi> Very true. And therefore they
were not brought to prove all points which concern the
Trinity. They were brought to prove this point in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular,
That <hi>it is not Inconsistent with Reason, that Three
Somewhats may be One God.</hi> And if they prove this, it is
what they were brought to prove. (when I undertake
other points, I may use other Arguments.) And this
hath been said so often, that (if he have any thing else
of moment to say) it is strange, that repeating the same
Objection (without any further strength) he should put
me so often to give the same Answer.</p>
            <p>His next head is <hi>Of Somewhats and Persons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We are told, that <hi>Christ and the Father are one,</hi> Joh. 10.
30. And <hi>these Three are One,</hi> 1 Joh. 5. 7. without giving a
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:56320:4"/>
name to <hi>these Three.</hi> Nor what shall we call them? <hi>These
three</hi>—what? Not <hi>three Gods;</hi> for that's false: (There
is but <hi>One</hi> God.) And <hi>three Persons</hi> he will not allow me
to call them, because it is not a Scriptural Word. (<hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi>
he grants is scriptural, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 3. but not <hi>Persons.</hi>)
I must not call them <hi>three Nothings.</hi> (For certainly it
was never meant to be thus understood, <hi>These three</hi> No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>things
<hi>are One:</hi> And when Christ said <hi>I and the Father
are One,</hi> he did not mean <hi>We two Nothings are One.</hi>) And
if they be not <hi>Nothing,</hi> they must be <hi>Somewhat;</hi> and
<hi>Three such,</hi> must be <hi>three Somewhats.</hi> And I could not
think of a more <hi>Innocent</hi> word, to design them by. And
therefore (that we might not quarrel about words) I
was content to wave the name of <hi>Persons,</hi> and (without
fixing a new name on them) design them by the word
<hi>Somewhat.</hi> (Presuming that those who do not take them
to be <hi>Nothing,</hi> would allow them to be <hi>Somewhat.</hi>) But
neither will this word pass with him.</p>
            <p>Now this is a hard case. The Scripture says <hi>These
Three,</hi> without giving them a <hi>Name.</hi> And then, <hi>We</hi>
must not give them a Name; because that Name will be
<hi>unscriptural.</hi> And yet if we do <hi>not</hi> give them a Name; he
tells us, They be Three Somewhats, <hi>without Name or
Notion:</hi> And that no two can <hi>agree, what this is,</hi> or <hi>what
is thereby meant;</hi> but <hi>as many Writers, so many Explicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi>
p. 8. 16.</p>
            <p>To which I say; As to the <hi>Notion,</hi> I think the Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox
are all, thus far, agreed; That they are Three such
<hi>Somewhats</hi> in God, as differ from each other more than
what we commonly call the <hi>Divine Attributes,</hi> but not
so as to be <hi>Three Gods.</hi> And though (within these li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits)
divers men may diversly express themselves, yet in
this <hi>Notion</hi> the Orthodox I think do all agree. And this
I had before declared, <hi>(Let.</hi> iv. <hi>p. 37.)</hi> though he please
totake no notice of it. (So that we are not without a
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:56320:4"/>
               <hi>Notion</hi> of it.) And if he will allow us to give a <hi>Name</hi>
to it; that Name (whatever it be) is so to be understood
as to denote <hi>this Notion.</hi> And we think the word <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi>
a fit <hi>Name</hi> to denote this <hi>Notion</hi> by. But if we may
not give it a <hi>Name;</hi> we must then say, The <hi>Notion</hi> is
such as was but now explained. But they will not
allow us to give it a <hi>Name.</hi> And as to our Agreement or
Disagreement, I think the <hi>Trinitarians</hi> do less disagree a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
themselves, than do the <hi>Anti-trinitarians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But he says, (p. 9.) <hi>I own the word Persons (when ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
to God) to be but Metaphorical; and not to signifie just
the same as when applied to Men, but somewhat Analogous
thereunto.</hi> True; I do so. And I have given my Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
why I do so, more than once. Because Two of
them being represented to us in Scripture under the
Names of <hi>Father,</hi> and <hi>Son,</hi> and this Son said to <hi>be begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten</hi>
of that Father: (which words are therefore not to be
quarrelled with, because Scripture Language:) No man
thinks that the one is <hi>so a Father,</hi> or the other <hi>so a Son,</hi>
or <hi>so Begotten,</hi> as these words signifie concerning <hi>Men;</hi>
but somewhat <hi>Analogous</hi> thereunto. And in what sense
they are <hi>Father and Son,</hi> they are (in a sense analogous
thereunto) <hi>Two Persons,</hi> and the <hi>Holy-Ghost</hi> a <hi>Third.</hi>
For <hi>Father</hi> and <hi>Son</hi> in a proper sense amongst men, are
such <hi>Relatives</hi> as the Latins did denote by the word <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sona</hi>
in the first and proper signification of that word:
And consequently <hi>Father</hi> and <hi>Son</hi> in this Analogical
sense, are (in a continuation of the same Analogy) <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons</hi>
in a like Analogical sense.</p>
            <p>But he says further, that in the explication of the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thanasian</hi>
Creed, (Let. iii. p. 13.) I interpret <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
by <hi>truly Persons,</hi> or <hi>properly Persons.</hi> I do so: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
I suppose it was intended to call them truly or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
<hi>such</hi> persons as are there meant, (answering to the
Greek Hypostases;) that is in such a sense as they are
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:56320:5"/>
there called <hi>Father</hi> and <hi>Son,</hi> and that the word <hi>Person</hi> is
a <hi>true and proper</hi> Continuation of the same Analogy.</p>
            <p>I have before declared, more than once, (in the places
by him cited, <hi>p.</hi> 9, 10.) that the true and proper sense of
the Latin word <hi>Persona,</hi> is not to denote a <hi>Man</hi> simply
(for this with them was <hi>Homo,</hi> not <hi>Persona,</hi>) but such
<hi>quality, state,</hi> or <hi>condition</hi> of a man, whereby he is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguished
from, or stands related to, other men. As a
<hi>King,</hi> a <hi>Father,</hi> a <hi>Iudge,</hi> and the like. And accordingly
the <hi>same Man,</hi> may sustain divers <hi>Persons.</hi> (He may be
a <hi>King,</hi> and a <hi>Father.</hi>) And according as such <hi>Condition</hi>
varies, the <hi>Person</hi> also varies. 'Tis true that in <hi>English,</hi>
(for want of a word that answers to <hi>Homo,</hi>) we some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
make use of the word <hi>Person,</hi> when we speak in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently
of <hi>Man, Woman,</hi> or <hi>Child;</hi> as when a <hi>Man,</hi>
or <hi>Woman,</hi> and an <hi>Infant</hi> are spoken of as <hi>three Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons:</hi>
But these the Latins would not have called <hi>tres
Personas,</hi> but <hi>tres Homines.</hi> (But if consider'd as <hi>Father,
Mother,</hi> and <hi>Child,</hi> they may, as thus related, be called
<hi>tres Personae.</hi>) And the Schoolmen sometimes (and some
others in imitation of them) do in a like sense use the
word <hi>Persona,</hi> for want of a Latin word which did indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferently
respect <hi>Men</hi> and <hi>Angels.</hi> But these are new
senses of the word <hi>Persona,</hi> quite different from what
the word signified in the purity of the Latin Tongue;
and unknown (I suppose) to the Fathers, who first ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
the word <hi>Personae</hi> to those of the Sacred Trinity:
As I had before shewed at large. <hi>Let.</hi> v. <hi>p. 15. &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But at this rate, he tells us, <hi>(p. 10.) The Socinians will
allow, God the Creator, God the Redeemer, and God the San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifier,</hi>
or <hi>God the Father, Son and Holy-Ghost, to be Three
Persons.</hi> And I am not sorry to hear it. But then I
would not have him say (as here) that I make them to be
only <hi>Three Names,</hi> nor yet (as <hi>p. 16.) three Gods.</hi> They
are more than <hi>three Names,</hi> but not <hi>Three Gods.</hi> For
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:56320:5"/>
even amongst men, to be a <hi>Father,</hi> is more than a <hi>Name,</hi>
or <hi>Title:</hi> And, in the Godhead, the <hi>Father, Son,</hi> and
<hi>Holy-Ghost,</hi> differ more than so many <hi>Names.</hi> And,
though I will not take upon me to determine precisely,
how great the <hi>Distinction</hi> is, (which is what at <hi>p.</hi> 8. he
cites out of my <hi>Let.</hi> ii. <hi>p.</hi> 3.) because I would not be posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
where the Scripture is silent<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet certainly 'tis not
so great as to make them <hi>Three Gods,</hi> but greater than
merely <hi>three Names,</hi> or even that between what we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
call the <hi>Divine Attributes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His next Head is about my <hi>Explication of the Athana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Creed.</hi> Which he finds (he says) to be an <hi>Explication
of the Damnatory Clauses</hi> therein. And he is not much
amiss in that observation. He was told so in the first words
of that <hi>Explication,</hi> and in the last words of the <hi>Post<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>script,</hi>
That it was <hi>in pursuance of a clause in a former Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
to that purpose; and that (though other things are
explained in it) <hi>it was chiefly intended for the Satisfaction of
those who do believe the Doctrine of it,</hi> (but stumbled at
those Clauses,) to shew that they need not (for these
Clauses) to reject that Creed.</p>
            <p>He tells us <hi>(p. 11.) there is a difference between Necessary
and Requisite.</hi> Be it so. But the word there is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>opor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tet</hi>
(not <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>) which I had rendred (<hi>p.</hi> 4. 21.) by
these words, <hi>It is necessary, it is mainly necessary, 'tis a
principal requisite, he ought</hi> to believe it. And certainly,
if he had not a great desire to cavil he would not have
quarrelled at this exposition, as not full enough for the
word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>.</p>
            <p>I had said, this Creed was <hi>part</hi> of the Catholick Faith;
the <hi>whole</hi> of which I took to be the <hi>whole word of God:</hi>
which a man is obliged to believe as to the <hi>Substantials</hi> of
it; but may <hi>be saved</hi> notwithstanding <hi>an Ignorance or Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake
as to some Particulars of lesser moment.</hi> Now he would
have it to be understood, that <hi>this Creed</hi> is the whole, not
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:56320:6"/>
               <hi>only a Part of the Catholick Faith:</hi> that <hi>nothing must be added
to it, nothing taken from it:</hi> And that <hi>every Man and Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
shall perish everlastingly who doth not believe and profess
this, without taking ought from it, or adding ought to it.</hi>
Why I think otherwise, I have shewed before, and need
not repeat it. But leave it to the Reader to judge, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
this or that be likelier to be true. And, whether he
take it to be the meaning of this writer, That all must
needs be damned, who lived and died before this Creed
was written; or who possibly never saw it or heard of
it, (though they should believe all the Substantials of the
Christian Faith, or Word of God, and held nothing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structive
of it;) or, who do not believe just so much
and no more. But if that be his opinion, he doth inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret
it more severely against himself than I would have
done; or (I think) any Man who had not a mind to
cavil.</p>
            <p>His next head is, about <hi>the Opinions charged upon Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus
and the Socinians.</hi> Concerning which, I do not think
it needful to trouble the Reader with repeating what I
had said of those Opinions, <hi>Let.</hi> iii. p. 44, 45, 46, 47, 48.
and <hi>Let.</hi> iv. p. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. or what he now brings in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse
of it. But shall leave it to the Reader, to judge (up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
what is said on both sides) whether I have not thereby
fully proved the charge; of the slight Opinion they have
of the Scripture (in competition with Reason) when it
crosses any of their beloved Tenets. And yet, if that
be not enough, himself directs, <hi>p.</hi> 16. to <hi>Maresius</hi> and
<hi>Lubertus,</hi> where (it seems) is more to be found to the
same purpose.</p>
            <p>But his Plea for himself, <hi>p.</hi> 16. I do admit. That <hi>if
Socinus have spoken erroneously, or unadvisedly, or hyperboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally,</hi>
he is not obliged to defend it (nor do I know that
he is obliged to be a <hi>Socinian.</hi>) He may renounce of <hi>Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi>
what he pleases.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:56320:6"/>
Whether he who defended the <hi>Thesis</hi> at <hi>Franeker,</hi> were
a Professed <hi>Socinian,</hi> or but covertly so, I tannot tell (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
I do not know the Man:) But I do not think it
more strange, to find a <hi>Socinian</hi> at <hi>Franeker</hi> (notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
the <hi>Synod</hi> of <hi>Dort</hi>) than at <hi>London.</hi> And some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
(<hi>p.</hi> 16.) he will hardly allow himself a <hi>Socinian,</hi>
nor any of his Party. But I hope he will not deny <hi>Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi>
to have been a <hi>Socinian.</hi> Therefore so far, at least, I
was right.</p>
            <p>But he would not have me <hi>blacken a man, long since dead,
who never did me any injury.</hi> Very well: He had before
challenged me to maintain my charge against the <hi>Socini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans:</hi>
And he now quarrels with me for so doing. He
will now hardly allow any to be a <hi>Socinian</hi> but <hi>Socinus</hi>
himself; and yet I must not blacken <hi>Socinus.</hi> What am
I then to do? I will even leave it as it is, and let the
Reader judge. And if he doubt, whether I, or my Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versary
be more fair in our Quotations; let him consult
the places and judge accordingly. And particularly that
of <hi>Epist. 5. ad Volkelium.</hi> I am at present not at home, nor
have Books about me. But sure I am, that <hi>Socinus</hi> doth
there (a few lines before what this Observator repeats)
directly deny, that <hi>the Soul after death doth subsist;</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
as I had affirmed (though I cannot now recite
the whole Sentence because I have not the Book at hand.)
But this the Repeater (whether by <hi>Docking</hi> or <hi>Decapita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>)
thinks fit to omit. And then I presume the Reader
will then find, that <hi>per se</hi> is not meant <hi>so by it self, or of
his own nature, as not by the gift and grace of God,</hi> (for so
it might as well be said of the Soul <hi>before</hi> death,) but, <hi>so
by it self as not in conjunction with the body;</hi> and then the
sense must be, that though the Soul with the Body be
<hi>praemiorum &amp; poenarum capax,</hi> yet the Soul <hi>of it self</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the Body, is not so. But I leave this, and the rest,
wholly to the Readers Judgment, to judge (upon view)
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:56320:7"/>
as he shall see cause. Adding this also, that he will find
it is not onely as to this Point of the <hi>Trinity,</hi> that <hi>Socinus</hi>
discovers so slight an opinion of the Scriptures in compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition
with Reason; but in other Points also where they
do not favour his opinions.</p>
            <p>He had told us before, of some body at <hi>Oxford,</hi> who,
maintaining a <hi>Thesis</hi> against the <hi>Socinians,</hi> was baffled by
his Opponent. Who or when this was he had not told
us; nor what that <hi>Thesis</hi> was. He now tells us, <hi>p.</hi> 16.
It was <hi>a Thesis against the Socinians, that they preferred
Reason before Scripture.</hi> Perhaps, when he recollects him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
(or consults his Informer,) he may find (if any
such thing happened as he suggests) it was on some <hi>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Thesis;</hi> and not <hi>against the Socinians,</hi> but <hi>against the
Arminians.</hi> But, be it as he says; I know nothing of it,
and shall not concern my self about it.</p>
            <p>But in requital of this story I told him another of
<hi>Sandius,</hi> who having proposed a Challenge, upon his <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blema
Paradoxum</hi> (contrary to the <hi>Divinity of the Holy-Ghost</hi>)
was so answered by <hi>Wittichius,</hi> that (as appears
by a Printed Letter published by his Friend and Partner
in that Disputation) they were so convinced, as to change
their opinion. I now add, that it so appears, not only
by his Friend's Printed Letter: but by another of <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius</hi>
himself to <hi>Wittichius;</hi> which I have not seen (and
I think it was never printed,) but the Contents of it may
be seen in another Treatise of <hi>Wittichius,</hi> with this Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,
<hi>Causa Spiritus Sancti Victrix.</hi> Printed at <hi>London,
1682.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But <hi>this matter</hi> (he says) <hi>is both Vnskilfully and Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairly
related.</hi> Why <hi>unskilfully?</hi> why <hi>unfairly?</hi> He says,
<hi>Sandius was an Arian;</hi> (Be it so:) <hi>not a Socinian.</hi> Very
well: Nor did I say that he was; but <hi>a Friend of the
Socinians.</hi> He was an <hi>Anti-trinitarian;</hi> and did promote
(against the <hi>Trinitarians</hi>) the common cause of <hi>Arians</hi>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:56320:7"/>
and <hi>Socinians,</hi> (though these perhaps might quarrel a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
themselves.) But this <hi>Observator</hi> thought (it
seems) because I did not <hi>call</hi> him an <hi>Arian,</hi> that I did
not <hi>know</hi> him so to be. And this (I guess) is what he
calls <hi>unskilful.</hi> But I can give him a better reason why I
should not call him so. I did not then know I should
have an <hi>Arian</hi> Adversary to deal with, (for my <hi>Arian</hi> Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versary
did not yet appear:) But my <hi>Socinian</hi> Adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
was already upon the stage, and with him I was now
dealing. Yet I could not say that <hi>Sandius</hi> was a <hi>Socinian,</hi>
but (that the <hi>Socinian</hi> might be concern'd in the story)
I said, He was a <hi>Friend of theirs.</hi> And what <hi>Vnskilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi>
appears in this? Had I then known (what since I
do) that I was to be attacqued by an <hi>Arian</hi> also; I
should rather have called him an <hi>Anti-trinitarian,</hi> which
had been common to both: But, knowing then of none
but a <hi>Socinian</hi> Adversary, I chose to call him <hi>a Friend of
theirs.</hi> Which was neither <hi>Vnfair</hi> nor <hi>Vnskilful.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Perhaps he thinks if not <hi>Vnskilful,</hi> 'twas at best <hi>Vnfair</hi> to
say that his Partner and He <hi>changed their opinion.</hi> But was it
not so? doth not his Associate expresly tell us (in the very
Title-page of his Letter of thanks for those Animadver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions)
<hi>per quas (animadversiones) errores suos rejicere co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actus
est?</hi> (whereby he was constrained to relinquish his
Errors?) Well, but did they change <hi>all</hi> their <hi>Opinions?</hi>
did they relinquish <hi>all</hi> their <hi>Errors?</hi> I believe not: But,
that opinion which was then in dispute; his <hi>Problema
Paradoxum,</hi> and the <hi>Errors</hi> therein. And, if he consult
the Book, he'll find it was so: And, that this <hi>Paradox</hi>
was it which he did relinquish. And, what his Paradox
was, he might there see it as well as I. Nor had he
told me, <hi>who,</hi> and <hi>when,</hi> and <hi>upon what Question,</hi> his sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
<hi>Anti-Socinian</hi> was baffled by his Opponent? or,
how I might come to know it? (And even now, when
he pretends to tell me the Question, I doubt he is mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:56320:8"/>
therein. But what <hi>Vnfairness</hi> was there in all this?
when I had told him where he might find as much of it
as I could tell him.</p>
            <p>But he tells us now, that <hi>Sandius was satisfied</hi> indeed
(as to the Point then in question,) but <hi>not of the Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the Holy Spirit.</hi> Nor did I say that he was. But
I can tell him, That he was nearer, even to this, than
our Observator was aware, or at least nearer than he
thinks fit to own to us. If he consult <hi>Wittichius</hi>'s latter
Treatise, entituled <hi>Causa Spiritûs Sancti Victrix,</hi> he will
there find an Extract of a Manuscript Letter of <hi>Sandius</hi>
to him. In which, to the best of my remembrance (for
I have not here the Book at hand) he tells <hi>Wittichius</hi> to
this Purpose. <q>That whereas in his <hi>Problema Paradoxum</hi>
he had been of opinion that by the <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> might
be meant <hi>the whole number of good Angels,</hi> he did not
now think so well of that opinion, as before their Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation:
but was considering of two other opinions
to be substituted instead thereof: That by the <hi>Holy-Ghost</hi>
might be meant, not the <hi>whole number</hi> of good
Angels, as before; but either some <hi>select number</hi> of
them, as being a superiour Order; or else some <hi>One
Angel</hi> as superiour to all the rest. (Which two he sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gests
to <hi>Wittichius</hi>'s further consideration.) But, if
neither of these should succeed (as he doubted they
would not;) he was then inclinable to say, with
him: That the <hi>Holy-Ghost</hi> was, indeed, the same <hi>Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
God</hi> with the <hi>Father</hi> and the <hi>Son.</hi>
               </q> If in reciting
this by memory, I have failed in any considerable Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstance,
I submit it to be rectified by the Book. But
if our <hi>Observator</hi> have seen that Treatise, and knows it
thus to be, I think we have more reason to complain of
<hi>Vnfairness,</hi> in his representing it as he doth: As if he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained
fixed in this Opinion, That the <hi>Holy-Ghost</hi> was
so a Person <hi>as the Arians always held.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:56320:8"/>
I am sorry to detain the Reader by following our <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servator</hi>
in his so many long excursions which do so little
concern the Business before us. For what (almost) of
what hath been hitherto mentioned of his, doth tend to
the confutation of what we affirm, That what we call
<hi>Three Persons,</hi> are more than <hi>Three Names,</hi> but not <hi>Three
Gods.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In (<hi>part of</hi>) his two last leaves, he would seem to come
somewhat nearer to the Business, but not much. He
tells us, <hi>p.</hi> 17. that <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Calvin</hi> did not like the
word <hi>Trinity.</hi> It may be so. (I'll take his word for it
without seeking the places; because I do not think it worth
while.) That they say 'tis <hi>Barbarous</hi> and <hi>sounds odly</hi> (I
suppose he knows that by a <hi>Barbarous</hi> word, is commonly
meant, a word not used by <hi>Classick Authors,</hi> or not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable
to the <hi>usual forms of speech</hi> in Latin and Greek
Writers.) Be it so. (And what if I had said so too?)
Suppose a <hi>Hunter</hi> should say, a <hi>Trinity</hi> of Hares <hi>sounds od<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi>
and another say the like of a <hi>Leash,</hi> and choose ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to say (in plain English) <hi>Three hares:</hi> the sense is
still the same. And if <hi>Calvin</hi> (who loved a <hi>smooth</hi> stile,
and <hi>pure-Latin</hi> words,) should say that <hi>Trinitas</hi> is a <hi>barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Word,</hi> (as not extant in <hi>Classick Authors:</hi>) what great
matter is there in all this?</p>
            <p>I will not trouble my self to enquire whether <hi>Trinitas</hi>
be, in that sense used in <hi>Tully;</hi> but sure I am that <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
is a good <hi>Greek</hi> word. And words, though not so well
contrived at first, yet when once received into common
use, and the meaning thereof understood, we chuse to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
rather than to make a needless change. This the
common Phrases of, <hi>your Worship, your Honour, your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,</hi>
&amp;c. for one <hi>Worshipful, Honourable, a Lord,</hi> &amp;c.
have been noted long since to be not Analogous to the
more usual Forms of speech in Latin and Greek Writers:
Yet <hi>Custom</hi> hath made them <hi>Allowable;</hi> and therefore we
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:56320:9"/>
do not scruple to use them. So <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Calvin,</hi> it
seems, thought the word <hi>Tres</hi> to be a better Latin word,
in this case, than <hi>Trinitas.</hi> And I had allowed our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versary,
(<hi>Let.</hi> iv. <hi>p.</hi> 36.) instead of <hi>Trinity in Vnity,</hi> to
say (if that will please him better) <hi>Three in One.</hi> Yet
<hi>Three</hi> and <hi>Trinity</hi> (to my apprehension) differ no more
than <hi>Ten</hi> and a <hi>Decade;</hi> or <hi>Twelve</hi> and a <hi>Dousain.</hi> But
what's all this to the matter in hand? Doth <hi>Luther</hi> or
<hi>Calvin</hi> any where say, that <hi>Father, Son, and Holy-Ghost,</hi>
are but <hi>three Names?</hi> or, that they be <hi>three Gods?</hi> If they
say neither of these; they do not contradict what we
affirm. 'Tis but as if a Man should chuse to say <hi>Ten
Commandments,</hi> rather than a <hi>Decade,</hi> or <hi>half a score;</hi> or
to say, there are, in the Apostles Creed, <hi>Twelve Articles</hi>
rather than <hi>a Dousain.</hi> And if these be the <hi>great disagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi>
he there complains of, it comes to a very small
matter.</p>
            <p>To his Argument, <hi>That only the Father is God,</hi> because
of <hi>Ioh. 17. 3. to know thee the only true God;</hi> he says, <hi>p: 17.
I give three Answers.</hi> (I do so.) But, he says, <hi>the first and
third are destructive of one another.</hi> Not so: they all agree
very well. And any of them will destroy his Argument.
'Tis not said, <hi>Thee only,</hi> but <hi>the only true God.</hi> He would
have us think it all one to say, <hi>Thee only, to be the true
God,</hi> and <hi>Thee to be the only true God,</hi> I think otherwise.
The one gives some seeming colour for his objection:
The other, not the least shadow. His Argument, <hi>The
Father is the only true God, therefore not the Son or Holy-Ghost,</hi>
is just in this Form, <hi>The God of Abraham is the only
true God, therefore not the God of Isaac, nor the God of Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob.</hi>
Which, I presume he will not allow to be a good
consequence.</p>
            <p>He would have it thought I grant, that if it were as
this form, <hi>the only, thee true God,</hi> then the <hi>Socinians had
undoubtedly gained the point.</hi> Not so. He hath not heard
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:56320:9"/>
me say so yet; nor is he like to do. If I should say, <hi>He
that brought Israel out of Egypt, and he only, is the true
God:</hi> my meaning would be but this, <hi>That God who
brought Israel out of Egypt, and that God only, is the true
God:</hi> And this must be understood to be said of him,
not <hi>as their deliverer out of Egypt,</hi> but <hi>as God.</hi> For he
was <hi>the true God</hi> (and the <hi>only true God</hi>) long before he
brought <hi>Israel</hi> out of <hi>Egypt;</hi> and would have been so,
though they had never <hi>been;</hi> or had never been <hi>so brought
out.</hi> There may be <hi>vera praedicatio,</hi> which is not <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
               <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>.</p>
            <p>And, of all men living, the <hi>Socinians</hi> are obliged to
say, that this title <hi>the true God,</hi> or <hi>only true God,</hi> belongs
to him, not as <hi>Father,</hi> but as <hi>God.</hi> For if (as they would
have us think) our <hi>Lord Iesus Christ</hi> had no <hi>Being</hi> before
his being made <hi>Man</hi> of the Virgin <hi>Mary;</hi> then neither
had he <hi>a Father</hi> till that time: But he was <hi>the only true
God</hi> from all Eternity; and therefore not (with this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duplication)
as <hi>Father of our Lord Iesus Christ.</hi> For he
was <hi>the only true God</hi> (according to their Doctrine) long
before the <hi>Man Christ</hi> had a Father; and would so have
been, though this <hi>Man</hi> had never been. And though
Christ <hi>speak</hi> to him as <hi>His Father,</hi> yet the title of <hi>the
only true God,</hi> he ascribes to him as <hi>God.</hi> If <hi>Solomon</hi> should
have said to <hi>David, Thou Father art King of Israel;</hi> he
was not therefore <hi>King of Israel</hi> as <hi>Father of Solomon;</hi> for
he was so, long before he was <hi>Solomon</hi>'s <hi>Father.</hi> Which
takes away all colour of our Observator's (imaginary)
contradiction here pretended: and leaves not the least
umbrage for it.</p>
            <p>As little force is there in his other cavil, <hi>p. 18. If the
Father and Son be the onely true God, then not the Holy-Ghost.</hi>
Yes; the Holy-Ghost also. For though it be not here
Affirmed; yet neither is it here Denied.</p>
            <p>But these Objections of his have been so often brought,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:56320:10"/>
and so often answered, that 'tis tedious to see the same
things brought so often over and over again.</p>
            <p>The like I say of what he repeats from 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 6.
which is answered sufficiently, <hi>Let.</hi> iii. <hi>p.</hi> 52. Nor is it
at all strange, or uncommon, that the word <hi>Father</hi> should
be sometime spoken of God personally considered, as <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of our Lord Iesus Christ,</hi> and sometime of God indefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely
(according to his Essence) without respect to <hi>this</hi>
or that Person. <hi>Father of Spirits,</hi> Heb. 12. 9. <hi>Doubtless
thou art our Father, Thou O Lord art our Father and our
Redeemer,</hi> Isai. 63. 16. <hi>Thou shalt call me My Father,</hi> Jer.
3. 4, 19. which the <hi>Socinians</hi> must not say to be meant
as to his <hi>Personality,</hi> as <hi>Father of our Lord Iesus Christ,</hi>
(for such, they say, he then was not,) but as to his <hi>Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence.
The everlasting Father,</hi> Isai. 9. 6. spoken of Christ,
not as to his <hi>Personality</hi> (for so, he was <hi>Son</hi>) but as to
his <hi>Essence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As to what he objects, <hi>p.</hi> 19. to that of <hi>Rom. 9. 5.
Christ; who is over all, God blessed for ever, Amen.</hi> I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
to what is said, <hi>Let.</hi> iii. <hi>p.</hi> 57. (too large to repeat
here<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) But how <hi>Amen</hi> (which is a word of <hi>Assevera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>)
should <hi>make it Nonsense,</hi> I do not understand. And
what was said of God indefinitely, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. 4. is said par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
of Christ, <hi>ver. 8. Who was dead and is alive,</hi> ver.
17, 18. (which description of Christ in particular, he
had begun at <hi>ver.</hi> 5. and continues beyond this place.) If
he deny it, let the Reader judge.</p>
            <p>As to that of 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5. 7. I refer to what hath been
said already. I think there is not much more to be said
thereof on either side than had been said long before ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
He or I began to write. And if after all he resolve
to hold to his opinion; he must give me leave to retain
mine. And let the Reader judge as he sees cause. And so
for that of <hi>Matt.</hi> 28. 19.</p>
            <p>As to all, in all those Leters to which he makes no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply;
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:56320:10"/>
it stands as it did: And if the Reader please to
read them over again, he will be able to judge, whether
it be all so contemptible as to have nothing of Weight
in it.</p>
            <p>I have said nothing to his Blustring and Contemptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Language, his <hi>Canting</hi> (or rather Railing) against
<hi>Schools, Metaphysicks, Mother Church, Alma Mater Acade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mia,
School-terms, Gothish and Vandelick terms, Abstract,
Concrete,</hi> (as if <hi>Long</hi> and <hi>Length</hi> were all one; and all
one to say <hi>David was Kingdom of Israel, and the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of Israel was Father to Solomon,</hi> as to say this of <hi>the
King of Israel</hi>) and other the like. (To which he is
wont to run out when he hath little else to say, but
would seem to say somewhat to make a Noise.) Because
the Reader would know (without my telling him) that
this is <hi>Raving</hi> rather than <hi>Arguing.</hi> And when he tells
us, so often, of <hi>The Brief History of the Vnitarians;</hi>
why might not I as well tell him, that <hi>Doctor</hi> Sherlock
<hi>had answered it;</hi> and means (I suppose) to <hi>Vindicate</hi> that
Answer, if he think there be need.</p>
            <p>So, when he runs Division upon <hi>Imperial Edicts, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiscations,
and Banishments, seizing and burning of Books,
Capital punishments, Fire, and Fagot;</hi> (with many other
things wherein I am not concern'd,) What is all this to
me? I do not know that I ever did him any hurt (unless
by discovering his Errors;) I was only <hi>Arguing</hi> as a <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putant;</hi>
not <hi>making Laws.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As little need be said of a many little things, as little
to the purpose: As, whether my Third Letter were not
<hi>rather a Book?</hi> Whether <hi>the things which God hath prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
for them that love him,</hi> are the <hi>Onely deep things of
God</hi> which we cannot comprehend? or the <hi>Onely secret
things which belong to God,</hi> while things <hi>Revealed</hi> belong
to us? Whether, what I knew <hi>forty years ago,</hi> I had been
studying and considering <hi>forty years</hi> (without thinking
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:56320:11"/>
of ought else all the while)? which certainly I could
not be, for I was then forty years old. Whether it be
better <hi>English</hi> to say, <hi>God the Creator, God the Redeemer,
and God the Sanctifier ARE, or IS but one God?</hi> Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Vnum</hi> (in the Neuter Gender, put absolute without
a Substantive) do not usually signifie <hi>One Thing?</hi> Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the word <hi>Trinitas,</hi> be a <hi>pure Latin,</hi> or a <hi>Barbarous</hi>
Word, (not to be found in <hi>Tully,</hi> any more than <hi>Vnitari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an)?</hi>
Whether <hi>Tres</hi> or <hi>Trinitas</hi> be the better Latin-word?
Whether, what in his former Letter, <hi>p.</hi> 9. were but
<hi>old-fashioned Notions,</hi> be now (in this last) <hi>New and Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious?</hi>
with other the like.</p>
            <p>But (besides in these and many others, he cavils with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a cause) what's all this to the Business in hand? Or
how doth it contradict what I affirm? <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>That,</hi> What in one Consideration are Three, may in another
Consideration be but One.</p>
            <p>That, <hi>We may safely say</hi> (without Absurdity, Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction,
or Inconsistence with Reason,) <hi>there may be in
God, Three Somewhats</hi> (which we commonly call Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons)
<hi>that are but One God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>That,</hi> These Three, are more than three Names, but not
three Gods.</p>
            <p>That, <hi>God the Creator, God the Redeemer, and God the
Sanctifier,</hi> (otherwise called God the Father, God the
Son, and God the Holy-Ghost,) <hi>are such Three.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I see nothing of what he hath said, doth overthrow
any of These.</p>
