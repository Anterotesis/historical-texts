            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IF thou art in any meaſure <hi>awake</hi> in
theſe daies wherein we live, and haſt ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
notice of the manifold, great, and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
<hi>Temptations</hi> wherewith all ſorts of
perſons that know the Lord, and profeſſe his
name are beſet, and whereunto they are
continually expoſed; with what <hi>ſucceſſe</hi>
thoſe <hi>Temptations</hi> have obtained to the
unſpeakable ſcandall of the Goſpell, with
the wounding and ruine of innumerable
ſoules: I ſuppoſe thou wilt not inquire any

being ſuited to the times that paſſe
over us, and thine own concernment in

meet to perſiſt in any ſuch enquiry, that
though my firſt engagement for the expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
of theſe <hi>meditations</hi> unto publick

whoſe <hi>avouching</hi> the intereſt of Chriſt in

the world by perſonall holineſs, and conſtant
adhering to every thing that is made pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
by its Relation to him, have given
them power over me, to require at any time
ſervices of greater importance, yet I dare
not lay my doing of it ſo upon that account,
as in the leaſt, to intimate, that with reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
to the generall ſtate of things mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
I did not my ſelfe eſteeme it ſeaſonable
and neceſsary. The variety of outward Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences
and Diſpenſations, wherewith I
have my ſelfe been exerciſed <hi>in</hi> this world,
with the inward trials they have been at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
withall, added to the obſervation
that I have had advantages to make of the
waies and walkings of others, their begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings,
progreſſes, and endings, their ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings
and falls in profeſsion, and converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
in darkneſſe and light, have left ſuch
a conſtant ſenſe &amp; impreſsion of the <hi>Power
&amp; danger of Temptations</hi> upon my mind
and ſpirit, that without other pleas and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences,
I cannot but own a <hi>ſerious call</hi> unto

<pb facs="tcp:115354:3"/>
in my own judgment, in this ſeaſon, need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.
But now <hi>Reader,</hi> if thou art amongſt
them, who takeſt no notice of theſe things,
or careſt not for them, who haſt no ſenſe of
the efficacy and dangers of Temptations
in thine own walking and profeſsion, nor
haſt obſerved the power of them upon o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers;
who diſcerneſt not the manifold ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages
that they have got in theſe daies,
wherein all things are ſhaken, nor haſt been
troubled or moved for the ſad ſucceſſes they
have had amongſt profeſſors, but ſuppoſeſt
that all things are well within door, and
without, and would be better, couldeſt thou
obtaine fuller ſatisfaction to ſome of thy
Luſts, in the pleaſures or profits of the

<hi>that though all men forſooke him, yet he

            <p>I ſhall not <hi>inſiſt</hi> on the <hi>particular</hi>
aimed at here by our Saviour in this
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:115354:7"/>
Caution to them that were then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
with him, the great <hi>Temptation</hi>
that was coming on them, from the
<hi>ſcandall of the Croſſe,</hi> was doubtleſſe
in his eye; but I ſhall conſider the
words as containing a generall directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to all the diſciples of Chriſt in
their following of him throughout all
generations.</p>
            <p>There are three things in the
words;</p>
            <p>1. The <hi>evill</hi> cautioned againſt:
<hi>Temptation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. The <hi>meanes</hi> of its prevalency;
by our <hi>entering into it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. The <hi>way</hi> of preventing it, <hi>watch</hi>
and <hi>pray.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is not in my thoughts to handle
the <hi>common place</hi> of <hi>Temptations,</hi> but
only the <hi>danger</hi> of them in Generall,
with the meanes of preventing that
danger. Yet that we may know what
we affirme, and whereof we ſpeak,
ſome concernements of the <hi>Generall</hi>
nature of Temptation, may be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:115354:8"/>
For the Generall nature of <hi>temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting</hi>
and <hi>Temptation,</hi> it lyes among
things indifferent; to <hi>try,</hi> to <hi>experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
to <hi>prove,</hi> to <hi>peirce</hi> a veſſell,
that the liquor that is in it may be
knowne, is as much as is ſignified by
it.</p>
            <p>Hence God is ſaid ſometimes to
<hi>tempt;</hi> and we are commanded as our
duty to <hi>tempt</hi> or <hi>try</hi> or <hi>ſearch</hi> our
ſelves, to know what is in us; and to
<hi>pray</hi> that God would do ſo alſo. So
Temptation is like a <hi>knife,</hi> that may
either cut the <hi>meat,</hi> or the <hi>throat</hi> of a
man; it may be his <hi>food,</hi> or his <hi>poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi>
his <hi>exerciſe,</hi> or his deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p>Temptation in its <hi>ſpeciall</hi> nature: as
it denotes any <hi>evill,</hi> is conſidered, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>actively,</hi> as it <hi>leads</hi> to evill, or
<hi>paſſively</hi> as it <hi>hath</hi> an evill and ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in it, ſo Temptation is taken for
affliction, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1. 2. For in that ſenſe,
we are <hi>to count it all joy when we fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
temptation,</hi> in the other, that we
<hi>enter not</hi> into it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:115354:8"/>
Againe <hi>actively</hi> conſidered, it ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
denotes in the <hi>Tempter,</hi> a deſigne
for the bringing about of the <hi>ſpeciall</hi>
end of temptation, namely a <hi>leading
into evill;</hi> ſo it is ſaid, that <hi>God tempts
no man,</hi> Jam. 1. 13. with a deſigne
for ſinne, as ſuch: or the <hi>Generall</hi> na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and <hi>end</hi> of Temptation which is
<hi>Triall;</hi> ſo God <hi>tempted Abraham,
Gen:</hi> 21. 1. And he <hi>proveth,</hi> or <hi>temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth</hi>
by <hi>falſe prophets,</hi> Deut. 13. 3.</p>
            <p>Now as to Gods <hi>tempting of any,</hi>
two things are to be conſidered.</p>
            <p>1. The end why he doth it.</p>
            <p>2. The way whereby he doth it.</p>
            <p>For the firſt, his Generall <hi>Ends</hi> are
two.</p>
            <p>1. He doth it to <hi>ſhew</hi> unto man
what is in him, that is the man him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe:
and that either as to his <hi>grace,</hi>
or to his <hi>Corruption.</hi> (I ſpeak not
now of it, as it may have a place and
beare a part in <hi>judiciary obduration.)</hi>
Grace and corruption lye <hi>deep</hi> in the
heart, men oftentimes deceive them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
in the ſearch after the <hi>one,</hi> or
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:115354:9"/>
the other of them. When we give
<hi>vent</hi> to the ſoule, to try what <hi>grace</hi>
is there, <hi>Corruption</hi> comes out: and
when we ſearch for <hi>corruption,</hi> Grace
appeares; ſo is the ſoule kept in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty;
we faile in our trialls. God
comes with a <hi>Gage,</hi> that goes to the
bottome. He ſends his inſtruments
of triall into the body, and the inmoſt
parts of the ſoule, and lets man ſee
what is in him, of what <hi>mettall</hi> he is
conſtituted.</p>
            <p>Thus he tempted <hi>Abraham,</hi> to
ſhew him his <hi>faith. Abraham</hi> knew
not what <hi>faith</hi> he had; (I meane what
<hi>power</hi> and vigour was in his faith) un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till
God <hi>drew</hi> it out by that great tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
and Temptation;<note place="margin">Gen. 22. 12.</note> when God ſaies
he knew it, He made <hi>Abraham</hi> know
it.</p>
            <p>So he tryed <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> to <hi>diſcover</hi>
his pride: God <hi>left</hi> him that he might
<hi>ſee what</hi> was in his heart, 2 <hi>Chron. 32.
31.</hi> He knew not that he had ſuch a
<hi>proud heart,</hi> ſo apt to be <hi>lifted</hi> up, as
he appeared to have, untill God tryed
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:115354:9"/>
him, and ſo let out his <hi>filth,</hi> and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
it out before his face. The iſſues
of ſuch diſcoveries to the Saints in
thankfulneſſe, humiliation, and trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring
up of experiences, I ſhall not
treat of.</p>
            <p>2. God doth it to <hi>ſhew himſelfe
unto man,</hi> and that</p>
            <p>1. In a way of <hi>preventing Grace;</hi>
A man ſhall ſee that it is God alone
who keeps from all ſinne. Untill we
are <hi>tempted,</hi> we think we live on our
owne ſtrength. Though <hi>all</hi> men do
this or that, <hi>we</hi> will not. When the
<hi>triall</hi> comes, we quickly ſee, whence
is our preſervation by ſtanding, or fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.
So was it in the caſe of <hi>Abime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leck,</hi>
Gen. 20. 6. I <hi>withheld thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. In a way of <hi>renewing Grace.</hi>
He would have the Temptation con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
with <hi>Paul,</hi> that he might <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veale</hi>
himſelfe to him, in the <hi>ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency</hi>
of his <hi>renewing</hi> grace, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 9.
We know not the power and ſtrength,
that God puts forth in our behalfe,
nor what is the <hi>ſufficiency</hi> of his Grace,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:115354:10"/>
untill comparing the <hi>Temptation</hi> with
our owne weakneſſe it appeares unto
us. The efficacy of an <hi>Antidote</hi> is
found when <hi>poyſon</hi> hath been taken,
and the pretiouſneſſe of <hi>medicines</hi> is
made knowne by <hi>diſeaſes.</hi> We ſhall
never know what <hi>ſtrength</hi> there is in
Grace, if we know not what <hi>ſtrength</hi>
there is in Temptation. We muſt be
<hi>tryed,</hi> that we may be made ſenſible
of being <hi>preſerved.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And many other <hi>good</hi> and gracious
ends He hath, which He accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
towards his <hi>Saints</hi> by his trialls
and temptations, not now to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted
on.</p>
            <p>2. For the waies whereby God
accompliſheth this his <hi>ſearch, tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,</hi>
or <hi>temptation,</hi> theſe are ſome of
them.</p>
            <p>1. He puts men on <hi>Great Duties,</hi>
ſuch as they cannot apprehend that
they have any ſtrength for, nor indeed
have. So he tempted <hi>Abraham,</hi> by
calling him to that Duty of <hi>ſacrificing
his ſonne;</hi> a thing abſurd to Reaſon,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:115354:10"/>
bitter to nature, and grievous to him
on all accounts whatever. Many men
know not what is in them, or rather
what is ready for them, untill they are
put upon what ſeemes utterly above
their ſtrength, Indeed upon what is
really above their ſtrength. The duties
that God in an ordinary way requires
at our hands, are not proportioned to
what <hi>ſtrength</hi> we have in our ſelves,
but to what help and reliefe is laid up
for us in Chriſt; And we are to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſe
our ſelves to the <hi>greateſt</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances,
with a ſetled perſwaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that we have not ability for the
<hi>leaſt.</hi> This is the law of Grace; But
yet when any duty is required, that
is <hi>extraordinary,</hi> that is a ſecret note
often diſcovered, in the yoke of Chriſt;
it is a triall, a temptation.</p>
            <p>2. By putting them upon <hi>great
ſufferings.</hi> How many have unexpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctedly
found ſtrength, to <hi>dye at a ſtake,</hi>
to endure tortures for Chriſt. Yet
their call to it was a triall. This <hi>Peter</hi>
tells us is one way whereby we are
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:115354:11"/>
brought into trying temptations, 1 <hi>Pe.
1.</hi> 6, 7. Our temptations ariſe from
the <hi>fiery triall,</hi> and yet the end is but
the <hi>triall</hi> of our <hi>faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. By his providentiall diſpoſing
of things ſo, as that <hi>occaſions</hi> unto
ſinne will be adminiſtred unto men,
which is the caſe mentioned, <hi>Dent. 13.
3.</hi> and innumerable other inſtances
may be adjoyned.</p>
            <p>Now they are not properly the <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations</hi>
of God, as coming from him,
with his end upon them that are here
intended: and therefore I ſhall ſet theſe
apart from our preſent conſideration,
that is then Temptation in its <hi>ſpeciall
nature,</hi> as it denotes an <hi>active</hi> Effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency
towards <hi>ſinning</hi> (as it is man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged
with evill, unto evill) that I
intend.</p>
            <p>In this ſenſe, Temptation may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
either ſingly from <hi>Satan,</hi> or the
world, or <hi>other</hi> men in the world, or
from our ſelves, or <hi>joyntly</hi> from all,
or ſome of them, in their ſeverall
Combinations.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:115354:11"/>
               <hi>Satan</hi> tempts ſometimes <hi>ſingly</hi> by
himſelfe, without taking advantage
from the world, the things, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
of it, or our ſelves. So he deales
in his <hi>injection</hi> of <hi>evill</hi> and blaſphem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
thoughts of God, into the hearts
of the Saints; which is his own work
alone, without any advantage from
the world or our owne hearts. For
nature will contribute nothing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto,
nor any thing that is in the
world, nor any man of the world;
for none can conceive a God, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
evill of him.</p>
            <p>Herein Sathan is alone in the <hi>ſin<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> and
ſhall be ſo in the <hi>puniſhment.</hi> Theſe
fiery darts are prepared in the forge of
his owne <hi>malice,</hi> and ſhall with all their
<hi>venome</hi> and poyſon, be turned into
his owne heart for ever.</p>
            <p>2 Sometimes he makes <hi>uſe</hi> of the
<hi>world,</hi> and joines forces againſt us,
without any helps from within. So
he Tempted our <hi>Saviour,</hi> by ſhewing
him the <hi>kingdomes</hi> of the <hi>world,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 4. 8<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> and
the glory of them. And the variety of
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:115354:12"/>
the <hi>Aſsiſtances</hi> he findes from the
world, in <hi>perſons,</hi> and things which I
muſt not inſiſt on, the innumerable
inſtruments and weapons he takes from
thence of all ſortes, and at all ſeaſons,
are inexpreſſible.</p>
            <p>3. Sometimes he takes in <hi>Aſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance</hi>
from our <hi>ſelves</hi> alſo. It is not
with us, as it was with <hi>Chriſt,</hi> when
<hi>Satan</hi> came to tempt him, he declares
that he <hi>had nothing in him,</hi> Joh. 14.
30. It is otherwiſe with us: He
hath, for the compaſſing of moſt of
his ends, a ſure <hi>party</hi> within our owne
breaſts, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1. 14, 15. Thus he tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted
<hi>Judas;</hi> He was at worke <hi>himſelfe;</hi>
he <hi>put it</hi> into his <hi>heart,</hi> to betray
Chriſt, <hi>Luk<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 22. 3;</hi> he <hi>entred</hi> into him
for that purpoſe, and he ſets the <hi>world</hi>
at worke, the things of it, providing
for him 30 <hi>peices of ſilver,</hi> verſ. 5.
<hi>they covenanted to give him money;</hi> and
the men of it: even the <hi>Prieſts and
Phariſees;</hi> and calleth in the <hi>aſſiſtance</hi>
of his own <hi>corruption;</hi> he was <hi>cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous,</hi>
a <hi>theife,</hi> and <hi>had the</hi> bagge.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:115354:12"/>
I might alſo ſhew, how the world
and our own Corruptions doe act <hi>ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gly</hi>
by themſelves, and <hi>joyntly</hi> in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction
with <hi>Satan,</hi> and one another
in this buſineſſe of Temptation.</p>
            <p>But the Truth is; the <hi>principles,</hi>
wayes and <hi>meanes</hi> of Temptations,
the <hi>kinds, degrees, efficacy,</hi> and cauſes
of them, are ſo inexpreſſibly large,
and various, the circumſtances of them,
from providence, Natures, conditions,
ſpirituall, and naturall, with the <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
caſes</hi> thence ariſing, ſo innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable,
and impoſſible to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized,
within any bound or order,
that to attempt the giving an account
of them, would be to <hi>undertake</hi> that,
which would be endleſſe. I ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
my ſelfe to give a <hi>deſcription</hi> of
the generall <hi>nature</hi> of that which we
are to watch againſt; which will make
way for what I ayme at.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Temptation then in Generall! is
any</hi> Thing, ſtate, way, condition, that
upon any account whatever, <hi>hath a</hi> force
or efficacy to ſeduce, to draw the mind,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:115354:13"/>
and heart of a man from that obedience
which God requires of him, into any
ſinne, <hi>in any degree of it whatever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In particular, that is a <hi>Temptation</hi>
to any man, which cauſes, or occaſions
him to ſinne, or in any thing to goe
off from his dutie, either by <hi>bringing</hi>
evill into his heart, or <hi>drawing</hi> out that
evill, that is in his heart, or any other
way, diverting him from <hi>communion</hi>
with God, and that conſtant, equall,
univerſall obedience, in matter, and
manner, that is required of him.</p>
            <p>For the clearing of this deſcription,
<hi>I ſhall only obſerve that,</hi> Though <hi>tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation</hi>
ſeemes to be of a more <hi>active</hi>
importance, and ſo to denote only the
<hi>power</hi> of ſeduction to ſinne it ſelfe, yet
in the <hi>Scripture</hi> it is commonly taken
in <hi>a neuter</hi> ſenſe, and denotes the <hi>mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
of the Temptation, or the <hi>thing</hi>
whereby we are tempted.</p>
            <p>And this is a Ground of the <hi>deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption</hi>
I have given of it; be it how <hi>it
will,</hi> that from any thing <hi>whatever,</hi>
within us, or without us, hath advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:115354:13"/>
to hinder in duty, or to provoke
unto, or in any way to occaſion <hi>ſinne,</hi>

            <p>HAving ſhewed what Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is, I come in the next
place to manifeſt what it is
to <hi>enter</hi> into Temptation:</p>
            <p>1. This is not merely <hi>to be tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted:</hi>
It is impoſſible that we ſhould
be ſo freed from temptation, as not
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:115354:14"/>
to be <hi>at all tempted.</hi> Whileſt <hi>Satan</hi>
continues in his power and malice, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt
the world and luſt are in <hi>being,</hi> we
ſhall be tempted: Chriſt (ſayes one,)
was made like unto us, that he <hi>might
be tempted;</hi> and we <hi>are tempted</hi> that
we may be made like unto Chriſt:
Temptation in generall, is compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive
of our whole <hi>warfare;</hi> as our
Saviour calls the time of his miniſtry,
the time of <hi>his Temptation,</hi> Luk. 22.
28. We have no promiſe that we ſhall
not be tempted at all, nor are to pray
for an abſolute freedome from tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations,
becauſe we have no ſuch
promiſe of being heard therein.</p>
            <p>The direction we have for our pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
is, <hi>lead us not into temptation,</hi> Mat.
6. 9. it is <hi>entering into temptation,</hi> that
we are to pray againſt: We may be
<hi>tempted,</hi> and yet not <hi>enter into tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi>
ſo that,</p>
            <p>2. Something more is intended
by this expreſſion, then the <hi>ordinary
work</hi> of Satan, and our own luſts, which
will be ſure to <hi>tempt</hi> us every day.
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:115354:15"/>
There is ſomething <hi>ſignall,</hi> in this <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring
into Temptation,</hi> that is, not the
Saints every dayes worke: It is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
that befals them <hi>peculiarly</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
to ſeduction unto ſinne, on
one account or other, by the way of
<hi>allurement,</hi> or <hi>affrightment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. It is not to be <hi>conquered</hi> by a
temptation; to fall downe under it;
to commit the <hi>ſinne</hi> or evill that we
are tempted to, or to omit the duties
that are oppoſed. A man may <hi>enter
into temptation,</hi> and yet not fall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Temptation. God can make a
<hi>way</hi> for a man to eſcape, when he is in,
he can breake the ſnare, tread downe
Satan, and make the ſoule more than
a Conquerour, though it have ente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
into temptation: Chriſt <hi>entered</hi>
into it, but was not in the leaſt <hi>foyled</hi>
by it, but</p>
            <p>4. It is, as the Apoſtle expreſſeth
it. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 9. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; <hi>to fall into</hi>
Temptation; as a man <hi>falls</hi> into a <hi>pit,</hi>
or a deep place, where are <hi>gins,</hi> and
ſnares, wherewith he is intangled.
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:115354:15"/>
The man is not preſently <hi>kill'd,</hi> and
deſtroyed, but he is <hi>intangled</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained:
He knowes not how to get
free, or be at liberty: ſo it is expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
againe to the ſame purpoſe, 1 <hi>Cor.
10.</hi> 13. no temptation hath <hi>taken you:</hi>
it is to be <hi>taken by</hi> a temptation, and
to be intangled with it, held in its
cords, not finding at preſent a way
to eſcape. Thence ſaith <hi>Peter 2 Ep.
2. 9. The Lord knoweth how to deliver
the Godly out of temptations:</hi> They are
<hi>entangled</hi> with them, God knowes
how to deliver them out of them.
When we ſuffer a temptation to <hi>enter
into us,</hi> then we <hi>enter</hi> into temptation.
Whileſt it knocks at the doore, we
are at liberty; but when any Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation
<hi>comes in,</hi> and <hi>parlies</hi> with the
heart, Reaſons with the mind, entices
and allures the affections, be it a long
or a ſhort time, doe it thus inſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
and imperceptibly, or do the
ſoule take notice of it, we enter into
Temptation;</p>
            <p>So then; unto our entring into Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation
is required;</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:115354:16"/>
1: That by ſome <hi>Advantage,</hi> or
on ſome Occaſion, Satan be more
<hi>earneſt</hi> than ordinary in his ſolicita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
to ſinne, by affrightments, or
allurements, by perſecutions, or ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions,
by himſelfe or others; or
that ſome <hi>luſt</hi> or corruption by his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtigation,
and advantages of outward
<hi>objects</hi> provoking, as in proſperity,
or terrifying, as in trouble, do <hi>tumultu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate</hi>
more than ordinary within us:
There is a <hi>ſpeciall acting</hi> of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour,
and principles of Temptation,
required thereunto.</p>
            <p>2. That the heart be ſo farre en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled
with it, as to be put to <hi>diſpute,</hi>
and argue in its owne <hi>defence,</hi> and
yet not to be able wholy to eject or
caſt out the poyſon, and leaven that
hath been injected; but is ſurprized,
if it be never ſo little off its watch, into
an intanglement not eaſy to be avoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded;
ſo that the ſoule may cry, and
pray, and <hi>cry againe,</hi> and yet not be
delivered; as <hi>Paul</hi> ſought the Lord
<hi>thriſe</hi> for the departure of his tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:115354:16"/>
and prevailed not. The entan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glement
continues. And this uſually
fals out in one of theſe two ſeaſons.</p>
            <p>1. When <hi>Satan</hi> by the permiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of God, for ends beſt knowne to
himſelfe, hath got ſome <hi>peculiar</hi> Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
againſt the <hi>ſoule.</hi> As in the
caſe of <hi>Peter: he ſought to winnow him,</hi>
and prevailed.</p>
            <p>2. When a mans luſts and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions,
meet with peculiarly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voking
<hi>objects,</hi> and occaſions, through
the condition of life, that a man is in,
with the Circumſtances of it: as it was
with <hi>David:</hi> of both which afterward.</p>
            <p>In this ſtate of things, a man is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
into Temptation; and this is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
the <hi>houre of Temptation,</hi> Rev. 3. 10.
The ſeaſon wherein it growes to a
head; the diſcovery whereof will give
farther light into the preſent enquiry,
about what it is to <hi>enter</hi> into Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
for when the <hi>houre</hi> of Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is <hi>come</hi> upon us, we are entred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
it.</p>
            <p>Every great and preſſing tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:115354:17"/>
hath its <hi>houre,</hi> a ſeaſon wherein
it growes to a <hi>head,</hi> wherein it is moſt
<hi>vigorous,</hi> active, operative and preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent.
It may be long in <hi>riſing,</hi> it may
be long urging more or leſſe; but it
hath a ſeaſon, wherein from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction
of other occurrences, ſuch as
thoſe mentioned, <hi>outward</hi> or <hi>inward,</hi> it
hath a dangerous <hi>houre,</hi> and then for
the moſt part, men enter into it.</p>
            <p>Hence that <hi>very temptation</hi> which
at <hi>one</hi> time, hath <hi>little</hi> or no power on
a man, he can deſpiſe it, ſcorne the
motions of it, eaſily reſiſt it; at <hi>ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi>
beares him away quite before it.
It hath from other <hi>circumſtances</hi> and
occurrences, got <hi>new ſtrength</hi> and effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy;
or the man is <hi>enervated</hi> and
weakened, the <hi>houre</hi> is <hi>come,</hi> he is
<hi>entred</hi> into it, and it prevailes. <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>
probably had Temptations before
in his <hi>younger</hi> dayes to <hi>Adultery</hi> or <hi>mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi>
as he had in the caſe of <hi>Nabal;</hi>
but the <hi>houre</hi> of temptation was not
come, it had not got its advantages a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>about
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:115354:17"/>
it, and ſo he eſcaped, untill af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards.
Let men looke for it, that
are expoſed unto temptations, as who
is not: They will have a ſeaſon wherein
their <hi>ſolicitations</hi> will be more urgent,
their Reaſonings more plauſible, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences
more glorious, hopes of <hi>Reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very</hi>
more appearing, opportunities
more broad and open, the doores of
evill made more beautifull than ever
they have been: Bleſſed is he who is
prepared for ſuch a ſeaſon, without
which there is no eſcaping. This as
I ſaid is the firſt thing required to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring
into Temptation; if it ſtay here,
we are ſafe.</p>
            <p>Before I deſcend to other particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars,
having now entered hereon I ſhall
ſhew in generall.</p>
            <p>1. How, or by what meanes, common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
any Temptation attaines its <hi>houre.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. How we may know when any
temptation is come to its <hi>high noone,</hi>
and is in its <hi>houre.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. It doth the firſt by ſeverall wayes.</p>
            <p>1. By long <hi>ſolicitations,</hi> cauſing the
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:115354:18"/>
mind frequently to converſe with the
evill ſolicited unto, it begets <hi>extenua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting</hi>
thoughts of it. If it make this
proceſſe, it is coming towards its
<hi>houre.</hi> It may be when firſt it began
to preſſe upon the ſoule, the ſoule
was <hi>amazed</hi> with the <hi>ugly appearance</hi>
of what it <hi>aymed</hi> at, and cryed, am I a
<hi>dogge?</hi> if this indignation be not day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>heightened,</hi> but the ſoule by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſing
with the <hi>evill,</hi> begins to grow
as it were <hi>familiar</hi> with it, not to be
<hi>ſtartled</hi> as formerly, but rather enclines
to cry, <hi>is it not a little one?</hi> then the
Temptation is coming towards its
high noone, Luſt hath then <hi>entiſed</hi>
and <hi>entangled,</hi> and is ready to conceive,
<hi>Jam,</hi> 1. 14. of which more at large af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards,
in our enquiry, how we may
know, <hi>whether we are entred into tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation,
or no:</hi> our preſent <hi>inqueſt</hi> is
after the houre and power of Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
its ſelfe.</p>
            <p>2. When it hath prevailed on <hi>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,</hi>
and the ſoule is not <hi>filled</hi> with
<hi>diſlike</hi> and abhorrency of them
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:115354:18"/>
and their wayes, nor with <hi>pitty</hi> and
prayer for their deliverance. This
proves an advantage unto it, and <hi>rayſes</hi>
it towards its height. When that
Temptation ſets upon any one, which
at the ſame time, hath poſſeſſed and
<hi>prevailed</hi> with many, it hath ſo great,
and ſo many Advantages thereby,
that it is ſurely growing towards its
<hi>houre.</hi> Its prevailing with others, is
a meanes to give it its <hi>houre</hi> againſt
us. The falling off of <hi>Hymeneus</hi> and
<hi>Philetus,</hi> is ſaid to <hi>overthrow the faith
of ſome,</hi> 2 Tim. 2. 17, 18.</p>
            <p>3. By <hi>complicating</hi> its ſelfe with
many conſiderations, that perhaps are
not <hi>abſolutely</hi> evill. So did the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation
of the <hi>Galathians</hi> to fall from
the purity of the Goſpell, freedome
from <hi>perſecution,</hi> union and conſent
with the <hi>Jewes:</hi> things in themſelves
good, were pleaded in it, and gave
life to the Temptation it ſelfe. But
I ſhall not now inſiſt on the ſeveral ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages,
that any temptation hath to
<hi>heighten</hi> &amp; greaten its ſelfe, to make its
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:115354:19"/>
ſelfe prevalent and effectuall, with
the contribution that it receives to
this purpoſe, from various circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances,
opportunities, ſpecious pleas
and pretences, neceſſities for the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>that,</hi> which cannot be done with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
anſwering the Temptation, and
the like; becauſe I muſt ſpeak unto
ſome of them afterwards.</p>
            <p>2. For the ſecond, it may be
knowne,</p>
            <p>1. By its reſtleſſe <hi>urgency,</hi> and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guing.
When a Temptation is in its
<hi>houre</hi> it is reſtleſſe: it is the time of
<hi>battell,</hi> and it gives the ſoule no reſt.
Satan ſees his Advantage, conſiders
his <hi>conjunction of forces,</hi> and knowes
that he muſt now prevaile, or be hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
for ever. Here are Opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
here are advantages, here are
<hi>ſpecious pleas</hi> and pretences; ſome
ground is already got by former ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guings,
here are extenuations of the
evill, hopes of pardon, by after en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours,
all in a readineſſe; if he can
do nothing now, he muſt ſit downe
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:115354:19"/>
loſt in his undertakings. So when he
had got all things in a <hi>readineſſe</hi> againſt
Chriſt, he made it the <hi>houre of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</hi>
When a temptation diſcovers
<hi>mille nocendi artes,</hi> preſſes <hi>within
doores</hi> by imaginations and reaſonings,
<hi>without,</hi> by ſolicitatious, Advantages
and Opportunities, let the <hi>ſoule</hi> know,
that the <hi>houre</hi> of it is come, and the
Glory of God, with its owne welfare,
depends on its behaviour in this triall:
as we ſhall ſee in the particular caſes
following.</p>
            <p>2. When it makes a Conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of <hi>Affrightments</hi> and <hi>Allurements.</hi>
Theſe two comprize the whole <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi>
of temptation. When both are
brought together, Temptation is in
its <hi>houre.</hi> They were both in <hi>Davids</hi>
caſe, as to the murder of <hi>Uriah;</hi> there
was the <hi>feare</hi> of his <hi>revenge</hi> on his
vvife, and poſſibly on himſelfe; and
<hi>feare</hi> of the <hi>publication</hi> of his ſinne, at
leaſt; and there was the <hi>allurement</hi> of
his preſent enjoyment of her, whom
he luſted after. Men ſometimes are
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:115354:20"/>
               <hi>carried</hi> into ſinne by <hi>love</hi> to it, and
are <hi>continued</hi> in it by feare of what will
enſue upon it. But in any caſe, where
theſe two meet, ſomething <hi>allures</hi>
us, ſomething <hi>affrights</hi> us, and the
reaſonings that runne between them
are ready to entangle us, then is the
<hi>houre</hi> of temptation.</p>
            <p>This then it is to enter into Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
this is the houre of it, of which
more in the proceſſe of our diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>3. There is the meanes of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention
preſcribed by our Saviour,
they are two.</p>
            <p>1. Watch. 2. Pray.</p>
            <p>1. The <hi>firſt</hi> is a generall expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
by no meanes to be limited to
its <hi>native</hi> ſignification, of <hi>waking</hi> from
<hi>ſleepe:</hi> to watch is as much as to be on
our <hi>guard,</hi> to <hi>take heed,</hi> to conſider
all waies, and meanes whereby an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy
may approach to us. So the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle
<hi>1 Cor.</hi> 16. 13. This it is to
watch in this buſineſſe, to ſtand <hi>faſt in
the faith,</hi> as good ſouldiers, <hi>to quit our
ſelves like men.</hi> It is as much as <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:115354:20"/>
to <hi>take heed,</hi> or look to our ſelves,
as the ſame thing is by our Saviour
often expreſſed. So <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 2. An
univerſall <hi>carefulneſſe,</hi> and diligence,
exerciſing its ſelfe in, and by all waies
and meanes, preſcribed by God, over
our hearts and waies, the baits and
methods of Satan, the occaſions and
advantages of ſinne in the world, that
we be not intangled, is that which in
this <hi>word</hi> is preſſed on us.</p>
            <p>2. For the ſecond <hi>direction</hi> of
<hi>prayer,</hi> I need not ſpeak to it. The
duty and its concernments are known
to all: I ſhall only adde, that theſe two
comprize the whole endeavour of faith
for the ſoules <hi>preſervation</hi> from temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>

<hi>but deliver us from the evill:</hi>
ſo deale with us, that we may be pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfully
delivered from that <hi>evill</hi> which
attends our entering into temptation.</p>
            <p>Our bleſſed Saviour knowes full
well our <hi>ſtate</hi> and condition; he knows
the power of Temptations, having
had experience of it;<note place="margin">Heb. 2. 52.</note> he knowes our
vaine <hi>confidence,</hi> and the reſerves we
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:115354:22"/>
have concerning our <hi>ability</hi> to deale
with <hi>Temptations,</hi> as he found it in
<hi>Peter;</hi> but he knowes our <hi>weakneſſe</hi>
and <hi>folly,</hi> and how ſoone we are caſt
to the ground; and therefore doth he
lay in this proviſion for inſtruction, at
the Entrance of his miniſtry, to make
us heedfull, if poſſible, in that which
is of ſo great concernment to us. If
then we will <hi>repoſe</hi> any confidence in
the <hi>Wiſdome, Love,</hi> and <hi>Care</hi> of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
Chriſt towards us, we muſt grant
the truth pleaded for.</p>
            <p>2. Chriſt promiſeth this freedome
and deliverance as a great <hi>Reward,</hi> of
moſt acceptable obedience, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 10.
This is the great promiſe made to
the Church of <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> wherein
Chriſt found nothing that he would
blame. <hi>Thou ſhalt be kept from the
houre of temptation;</hi> not thou ſhalt be
<hi>preſerved in it,</hi> but he goes higher,
<hi>thou ſhalt be kept from it.</hi> There is,
ſaith our Saviour, an <hi>houre of Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation</hi>
coming: a ſeaſon that will make
<hi>havoke</hi> in the world; multitudes ſhall
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:115354:23"/>
then fall from the faith, deny and blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme
me! Oh how few will be able
to ſtand and hold out? Some will be
utterly deſtroyed and periſh for ever,
ſome will get <hi>wounds</hi> to their ſoules
that ſhall never be well healed, whilſt
they live in this world, and have their
bones broken, ſo as to go halting all
their daies. But ſaith he, <hi>becauſe thou
haſt kept the word of my patience,</hi> I will
be tender towards thee, and <hi>keep thee</hi>
from this houre of temptation. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely
that which Chriſt thus <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes</hi>
to his beloved Church, as a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
of her ſervice, Love, and Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
is no light thing; whatever
Chriſt promiſeth to his <hi>ſpouſe,</hi> is a
fruit of unſpeakable Love; that is ſo
in an <hi>eſpeciall</hi> manner, which is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed
as a Reward of <hi>ſpeciall</hi> obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
            <p>3. Let us to this purpoſe conſider
the Generall <hi>iſſues</hi> of mens <hi>entering
into temptation;</hi> and that of <hi>bad</hi> and
<hi>good</hi> men, of ungrounded profeſſors,
and of the choyſeſt Saints.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:115354:23"/>
For the firſt I ſhall offer but one or
two Texts of Scripture, <hi>Luk. 8. 13.
They on the rock, are they which, when
they heare, receive the word with joy, and
have no roote, but for a while believe:</hi>
well! how long do they believe?
they are affected with the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the word, and <hi>believe</hi> thereon:
make profeſſion, bring forth ſome
fruits: but untill when do they abide?
ſaies he, <hi>in the time of temptation they
fall away:</hi> when once they enter into
temptation they are <hi>gone</hi> for ever:
Temptation withers all their profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
and ſlaies their ſoules. We ſee
this accompliſhed every day; men
who have attended on the <hi>preaching</hi>
of the Goſpell, been affected and <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted</hi>
with it, and have beene looked on,
it may be, as <hi>believers,</hi> and thus have
continued for ſome <hi>yeares;</hi> no ſooner
doth a temptation befall them, that
hath <hi>vigor</hi> and permanency in it, but
they are turned out of the way, and
are gone for ever: They fall to hate
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:115354:24"/>
the word they have delighted in, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe
the profeſſors of it, and are har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened
by ſinne. So <hi>Matth. 7. 26. He
that heareth theſe words of mine, and
doth them not, is like a man that built
his houſe upon the ſand: but</hi> what doth
this houſe of profeſſion do? it ſhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
him, keeps him warme, and ſtands
for a while; but ſaith he, <hi>verſ.</hi> 27.
when the <hi>raine deſcendes,</hi> when Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
comes, it <hi>falls</hi> utterly, and its
<hi>fall</hi> is great. <hi>Judas</hi> followes our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
three yeares, and all goes well
vvith him; He no ſooner <hi>enters into
temptation,</hi> Satan hath got him, and
<hi>winnowed</hi> him, but he is gone. <hi>Demas</hi>
vvill preach the Goſpell, untill the
<hi>love of the world</hi> befall him, and he is
utterly turned aſide, It vvere endleſſe
to give <hi>inſtances</hi> of this; <hi>Entrance in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
temptation, is with this ſort of men
an entrance into Apoſtaſy, more or
leſſe, in part or in whole, it faileth
not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. For the <hi>saints</hi> of God themſelves,
let us ſee by ſome inſtances,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:115354:24"/>
what iſſue they have had of thir <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring
int. Temptation.</hi> I ſhall name a
fevv; <hi>Adam,</hi> was the <hi>ſonne of God,
Luk.</hi> 3. created in the <hi>image</hi> of God:
full of that <hi>integrity,</hi> rightouſneſſe
and holineſſe which might be and
was an eminent Reſemblance of the
<hi>Holineſſe</hi> of God. He had a farre
greater inherent <hi>ſtock</hi> of Ability then
we; and had nothing <hi>in him</hi> to entice
or <hi>ſeduce</hi> him, yet this <hi>Adam</hi> no
ſooner <hi>enters into temptation,</hi> but he
is gone, loſt, and <hi>ruined,</hi> he and all
his poſterity with him. What can
we expect in the like condition, that
have not only in our temptations, as
he had, a <hi>cunning devill</hi> to deale with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,
but a <hi>curſed world,</hi> and a <hi>corrupt</hi>
heart alſo.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Abraham</hi> was the father of the
faithfull;<note place="margin"> Gen. 12. 12, 13.</note> whoſe <hi>faith</hi> is propoſed as a patterne to all them that ſhall believe,
yet he entring <hi>twice</hi> into the <hi>ſame temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 20. 2</note>
namely that of <hi>feare</hi> about his
wife, was <hi>twice</hi> over powred by it, to
the <hi>diſhonour</hi> of God, and no doubt
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:115354:25"/>
the <hi>diſquietment</hi> of his owne ſoule.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>David</hi> is called a man after Gods
owne heart by God himſelfe; yet
what a dreadfull thing is the <hi>ſtory</hi> of
his <hi>entring into temptation:</hi> He is no
ſooner <hi>entangled,</hi> but he is plunged
into <hi>Adultery;</hi> thence ſeeking deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance
by his owne invention, like a
poore creature in toyle he is entang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
more and more, untill he lies as
one <hi>dead,</hi> under the power of ſinne and
folly.</p>
            <p>I might mention <hi>Noah, Lot, He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zekiah,
Peter,</hi> and the reſt whoſe
temptations, and <hi>falls</hi> therein, are
on record for our inſtruction. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely
be that hath any heart in theſe
things, cannot but ſay as the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
of <hi>Samaria</hi> upon the letter of
<hi>Jehu;</hi> behold <hi>two Kings</hi> ſtood not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

Lord! if ſuch <hi>mighty pillars</hi> have been
caſt to the ground, ſuch <hi>Cedars</hi> blowne
downe, how ſhall I ſtand before <hi>temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations?</hi>
Oh keep me that I enter not
in; <hi>veſtigia terrent,</hi> behold the <hi>footſteps</hi>
               <pb n="41" facs="tcp:115354:25"/>
of them that have gone in; whom
doe you ſee retiring without a <hi>wound?</hi>
a blemiſh at leaſt? On this account
would the Apoſtle have us to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe
tenderneſſe towards them that are
<hi>fallen</hi> into ſinne, <hi>Gal. 6. 1. conſidering
thy ſelfe, leſt thou alſo be tempted:</hi> he
doth not ſay, leſt <hi>thou alſo ſinne,</hi> or
<hi>fall,</hi> or be <hi>overtaken</hi> with a fault; but
leſt <hi>thou alſo be tempted;</hi> thou ſeeſt
the power of temptation in others, and
knoweſt not how ſoone thou may'ſt be
<hi>tempted,</hi> nor what <hi>will</hi> be the ſtate and
condition, of thy ſoule thereupon. Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuredly
he that hath ſeene ſo many
better, ſtronger men than himſelfe
<hi>faile,</hi> and caſt downe in the triall, will
thinke it <hi>incumbent</hi> on him to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
the <hi>battell,</hi> and if it be poſſible, to
come there no more. Is it not a mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
for a man that can ſcarce <hi>crawle</hi>
up and downe, he is ſo weake, (which
is the caſe of moſt of us) if he avoid
not what he hath ſeen <hi>Giants</hi> foyled
in the undertaking of? Thou art yet
<hi>whole</hi> and ſound, <hi>take heed</hi> of tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:115354:26"/>
leſt it be with thee as it was with
<hi>Abraham, David, Lot, Peter, Heze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiah,</hi>
the <hi>Galathians</hi> who <hi>fell</hi> all in the
time of triall.</p>
            <p>In nothing doth the folly of the
hearts of men ſhew it ſelfe more open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in the dayes wherein we live, than
in this curſed boldneſſe, after ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
warnings from God, and ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
ſad experiences every day under
their eyes, of <hi>running</hi> into, and put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
themſelves upon Temptations.
Any <hi>ſociety,</hi> any <hi>companie,</hi> any <hi>condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi>
of outward advantages without
once weighing what their <hi>ſtrength,</hi>
or what the concernment of their
poore ſoules, they are ready for,
Though they goe over the dead, and
the ſlaine, that in thoſe wayes and
pathes, but even now, fell downe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
them, yet they will goe on with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
regard or trembling. At this
doore are gone out <hi>hundreds, thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands</hi>
of Profeſſors within a few yeares.
But</p>
            <p>4. Let us, <hi>conſider our ſelves;</hi> what
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:115354:26"/>
our weakneſſe is, and what Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is; its power and efficacy, with
what it leades unto.</p>
            <p>1. For <hi>our ſelves,</hi> we are <hi>weakneſſe</hi>
it ſelfe. We have no ſtrength, no
power to withſtand. Confidence
of any <hi>ſtrength</hi> in us, is one great part
of our weakneſſe. It was ſo in <hi>Peter.</hi>
He that ſayes he can doe any thing,
can doe <hi>nothing</hi> as he ſhould. And
which is worſe, it is the worſt kind of
<hi>weakneſſe</hi> that is in us: a <hi>weakneſſe</hi> from
treachery; a weakneſſe ariſing from
that <hi>party</hi> which every Temptation
hath in us. If a <hi>caſtle</hi> or fort be never
ſo <hi>ſtrong</hi> and well fortified, yet if there
be a treacherous party within, that is
ready to betray it on every opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
there is no preſerving it from the
Enemy. There are <hi>Traytors</hi> in our
hearts, ready to take part, to cloſe,
and ſide with every Temptation, and
to give up all to them; yea to ſolicite
and bribe temptations to doe the work;
as Traytors incite an enemy. Doe not
<hi>flatter</hi> your ſelves that you ſhall hold
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:115354:27"/>
out; there are ſecret <hi>luſts</hi> that lie lur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
in your hearts, which perhaps
now <hi>ſtir</hi> not, which aſſoone as any
temptation befals you, will riſe, <hi>tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>multuate,</hi>
cry, diſquiet, ſeduce, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
give over, untill they are either
killed, or ſatisfied. He that promiſes
himſelfe, that the <hi>frame</hi> of his heart
will be the ſame under a Temptation,
as it is before, will be <hi>wofully</hi> miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken:
Am I a <hi>dog,</hi> that I ſhould doe this
thing? ſayes <hi>Hazael;</hi> yea! thou wilt be
ſuch <hi>a dog,</hi> if ever thou be <hi>King of Syria:</hi>
Temptation from thy intereſt will <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
thee: He that now abhors the
thoughts of ſuch and ſuch a thing, if
he <hi>once</hi> enters into temptation, will
<hi>find</hi> his heart enflamed towards it,
and all contrary reaſonings overborne
and ſilenced. He will deride his <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi>
feares, caſt out his ſcruples, and
contemne the conſideration that he li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
upon. Little did <hi>Peter</hi> thinke he
ſhould deny and <hi>forſweare</hi> his maſter,
ſo ſoone as ever he was queſtioned
whether he knew him or no; it was
<hi>no better</hi> when the <hi>houre</hi> of Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:115354:27"/>
came; All reſolutions were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten,
all love to Chriſt buried, the
preſent Temptation cloſing with his
<hi>carnall feare</hi> carryed all before it.</p>
            <p>To handle this a little more diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctly;
I ſhall conſider the meanes of
ſafety from the <hi>power of Temptation,</hi> if
we enter therein, that may be expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
from our ſelves; and that <hi>in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall</hi>
as to the ſpring and riſe of them;
and in <hi>particular,</hi> as to the wayes of
exerting that ſtrength we have, or
ſeeme to have.</p>
            <p>1. In generall, all we can looke
for <hi>is</hi> from our <hi>hearts;</hi> what a mans
<hi>heart is</hi> that is, Hee; but now what
<hi>is</hi> the <hi>heart</hi> of a man in ſuch a ſeaſon?</p>
            <p>1. Suppoſe a man <hi>is</hi> not a <hi>Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,</hi>
but only a <hi>Profeſſor</hi> of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell,
what can the heart of ſuch an
one doe? <hi>Prov. 10. 20. The heart of
the wicked is little worth;</hi> and ſurely
that vvhich <hi>is little worth</hi> in <hi>any</hi> thing,
<hi>is</hi> not much worth in <hi>this.</hi> A vvic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
man, may in <hi>outward</hi> things be of
great uſe; but come to his heart; that
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:115354:28"/>
is <hi>falſe</hi> and a thing of nought. Now
withſtanding of Temptation is heart
worke; and when it comes like a flood,
can ſuch a <hi>rotten turfe</hi> as a wicked mans
heart, ſtand before it? but of theſe
before; entring into Temptation,
and Apoſtacy is the ſame with them.</p>
            <p>2. Let it be whoſe heart it will;
<hi>Prov. 28. 26. He that truſteth in his
owne heart is a foole;</hi> He that doth ſo,
be he what he will, in <hi>that</hi> he is <hi>foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh:
Peter</hi> did ſo in his Temptation;
<hi>he truſted in his own heart; though
all men forſake thee I will not;</hi> it
was his <hi>folly;</hi> but why was is it his
folly? <hi>He ſhall not be delivered;</hi> It
will not preſerve him in ſnares; it will
not deliver him in temptations. The
Heart of a man will promiſe him very
faire before a Temptation comes;
am I a <hi>dogge,</hi> ſayes <hi>Hazael,</hi> that I
ſhould doe this thing? though all
men ſhould deny thee I will not: ſhall
I doe this evill? it cannot be; All
the Arguments that are ſuited to give
<hi>check</hi> to the heart in ſuch a condition,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:115354:28"/>
are muſtered up; did not <hi>Peter</hi> thinke
you do ſo? What, deny my maſter,
the Son of God; my Redeemer; who
loves me? Can ſuch ingratitude, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beliefe,
rebellion, befall me? I will
not doe it; ſhall then a man reſt in it,
that his heart will be ſtedfaſt? let the
wiſeman anſwer, <hi>he that truſteth in his
owne heart is a foole.</hi> The heart is <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfull,</hi>
Jer. 17. 9. We would not
willingly truſt any thing wherein there
is <hi>any</hi> deceit or guile; Here is that
which is <hi>deceitfull above all things.</hi> It
hath a thouſand ſhifts and treacheries,
that it will deale withall, when it
comes to the triall, every temptation
will ſteale it away; <hi>Hoſ<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> 4. 11. Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
mens hearts deceive them no
oftner then they doe truſt in them,
and then they never faile ſo to doe.</p>
            <p>2. Conſider the particular <hi>wayes</hi>
and meanes, that ſuch an <hi>heart</hi> hath,
or can uſe to ſafeguard its ſelfe, in the
houre of Temptation, &amp; their <hi>inſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency</hi>
to that purpoſe will quickly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare.
I ſhall inſtance in ſome few
only.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="48" facs="tcp:115354:29"/>
1. Love of <hi>honour</hi> in the world;
Reputation and eſteem in the Church,
obtained by former profeſſion and
walking, is one of the hearts <hi>owne
weapons</hi> to defend its ſelfe in the houre
of Temptation. Shall ſuch an <hi>one</hi> as
I fly? I who have had ſuch a Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
in the Church of God, ſhall I
now loſe it by giving way to this luſt?
to this temptation? by cloſing with
this, or that publick evill? This Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration
hath ſuch an influence on the
ſpirits of ſome, that they thinke it
will be a ſhield and buckler, againſt any
aſſaults that may befall them. They
will dye a thouſand times before they
will forfeit that <hi>repute</hi> they have in the
Church of God. But alas, this is but
a <hi>which,</hi> or a new <hi>cord,</hi> to bind a
<hi>Gyant</hi> temptation withall: What
thinke you of the third part of the
<hi>ſtarres of heaven?</hi> Revel. 12. 4. Had
they not <hi>ſhone</hi> in the firmament of the
Church? Were they not ſenſible
more then enough of their owne <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,</hi>
height, uſefulneſſe, and reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:115354:29"/>
but when the <hi>Dragon</hi> comes
with his temptations, he caſts them
downe to the earth. Yea great tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations
vvill make men, vvho have
not a better defence, inſenſibly forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy
themſelves againſt that <hi>diſhonour,</hi>
and diſreputation that their vvayes are
attended vvithall: <hi>populus ſibilet, nec
mihi plaudo;</hi> doe vve not knovv inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
yet living, of ſome, vvho have
ventured on compliances vvith vvic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
men, after the Glory of a long
and uſefull profeſſion, and vvithin a
vvhile finding themſelves caſt dovvn
thereby from their Reputation vvith
the <hi>Saints,</hi> have hardened themſelves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
it, &amp; ended in Apoſtacy? as <hi>Joh.
15.</hi> 6. This kept not <hi>Judas,</hi> it kept not
<hi>Hymeneus</hi> nor <hi>Philetus,</hi> it kept not the
<hi>ſtarres of heaven,</hi> nor will it keepe
thee.</p>
            <p>2. There is on the other ſide, the
conſideration of <hi>ſhame,</hi> reproach, loſſe,
and the like. This alſo men may put
their truſt in, as a defence againſt tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations;
and doe not feare but to be
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:115354:30"/>
ſafeguarded and preſerved by it. They
would not for the world bring that
<hi>ſhame</hi> and reproach upon themſelves,
that ſuch and ſuch miſcarriages are at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
withall.</p>
            <p>Now beſides that this conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
extends it ſelfe only to <hi>open ſins,</hi>
ſuch as the world takes notice of, and
abhorres, and ſo is of no uſe at all in
ſuch <hi>caſes,</hi> as wherein pretences and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours
may be invented and uſed, nor
in publicke temptations to looſe and
careleſſe walking, like thoſe of our
dayes, nor in caſes that may be diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
in themſelves, though expreſly
ſinfull to the conſciences of perſons
under temptations, nor in heart ſins,
in all vvhich, and moſt other caſes
of temptation, there are innumerable
<hi>reliefes</hi> ready to be tendered unto the
heart againſt this conſideration; beſides
all this I ſay vve ſee by experience,
hovv eaſily this coord is broken
vvhen once the heart begins to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled:
each corner of the land is full
of examples to this purpoſe. But</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="50" facs="tcp:115354:30"/>
3. They have yet <hi>that</hi> which out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weighes
theſe leſſer <hi>conſiderations;</hi>
namely that they will not wound their
owne <hi>conſciences,</hi> and diſturbe their
<hi>peace;</hi> and bring themſelves in danger
of hell fire. This ſurely, if any thing,
will preſerve men in the <hi>houre of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation.</hi>
They will not laviſh away
their <hi>peace,</hi> nor venture their ſoules, by
running on God, and the thick boſſes
of his buckler. What can be of more
efficacy and <hi>prevalency?</hi> I confeſſe
this is of great importance; and oh
that it were more pondered than it is;
that we laid more weight upon the
preſervation of our peace with God,
than we doe, yet I ſay that even this
conſideration in him who is other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where
off from his watch, and doth
not make it his worke to follow the
other rules inſiſted on; it will not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
him: For</p>
            <p>1. The peace of ſuch an one, may
be <hi>falſe peace,</hi> or ſecurity; made up of
preſumption and falſe hopes, yea
though he be a Believer, it may be ſo;
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:115354:31"/>
ſuch was <hi>Davids</hi> peace after his ſinne,
before <hi>Nathan</hi> came to him; ſuch was
<hi>Laodicha's</hi> peace, when ready to pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh;
and <hi>Sardis</hi> her peace, when dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
What ſhould ſecure a ſoule that
it is otherwiſe; ſeeing it is ſuppoſed,
that it doth not univerſally labour to
keep the <hi>word of Chriſts patience,</hi> and
to be watchfull in all things? thinke
you that the peace of many in theſe
dayes, will be found to be true peace
at laſt? nothing leſſe; they goe alive
downe to hell, and death will have
dominion over them in the morning.
Now if a mans peace be ſuch, doe you
think that can <hi>preſerve</hi> him, which
cannot <hi>preſerve</hi> its ſelfe? It will give
way at the firſt vigorous aſſault of a
Temptation in its hight and houre.
Like a broken reed, it will runne into
the hand of him that leaneth on it: But</p>
            <p>2. Suppoſe the <hi>peace</hi> cared for, and
propoſed to ſafeguard the ſoule, be
<hi>true</hi> and <hi>good;</hi> yet when all is laid up in
this one bottome, when the houre of
te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ptation comes, ſo many reliefs will be
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:115354:31"/>
tendred againſt this conſideration, as
vvill make it uſeleſſe. This evill is
<hi>ſmall,</hi> it is <hi>queſtionable,</hi> it fals not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly
and dovvnright upon <hi>conſcience;</hi>
I doe but feare <hi>conſequences,</hi> it may
be I may keep my <hi>peace</hi> notvvithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
others of the people of God, have
fallen and yet <hi>kept,</hi> or <hi>recovered</hi> their
peace: if it be loſt for a ſeaſon, it may
be obtained againe; I vvill not ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite
its <hi>ſtation</hi> any more; or though
<hi>peace</hi> be loſt, <hi>ſafty</hi> may remaine; and
a thouſand ſuch pleas there are, vvhich
are all planted as batteries againſt this
fort, So that it cannot long hold out.</p>
            <p>3. The fixing on this particular
only; is to make good one <hi>paſſage</hi> or
entrance, vvhileſt the Enemy aſſaults
us round about. It is true, a little
armour vvould ſerve to defend a man,
if he might chooſe vvhere his enemy
ſhould ſtrike him; but vve are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
to take the <hi>whole armour of
God</hi> if vve intend to <hi>reſiſt</hi> and <hi>ſtand,</hi>
Epheſ. 6. This vve ſpeake of is but
one peice, and vvhen our eye is only
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:115354:32"/>
to that, Temptation may enter and
prevaile twenty other wayes. For in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance!
a man may be tempted to
<hi>wordlineſſe,</hi> unjuſt gaine, revenge, vaine
glory or the like; if he fortify him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
alone with this conſideration, he
will not doe this thing, and wound
his <hi>conſcience,</hi> and looſe his peace; fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his eye on this particular, and
counting himſelfe ſafe, whileſt he is
not overcome on that hand; it may
be neglect of private <hi>Communion</hi> with
God, <hi>ſenſuality</hi> and the like doe creep
in &amp; he is not one jot in a better condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
then if he had fallen under the
power of that <hi>part</hi> of the temptation,
which was moſt viſibly preſſing on him.</p>
            <p>4. Experience gives to ſee that this
doth &amp; will <hi>faile</hi> alſo. There is no Saint
of God, but puts a valuation on the
<hi>peace</hi> he hath: yet how many of them
faile in the day of temptation? but yet</p>
            <p>4. They have another conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
alſo, and that is, the <hi>vileneſſe of
ſinning againſt God?</hi> how ſhall they doe
this thing and <hi>ſin againſt God</hi> the God
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:115354:32"/>
of their mercies, of their ſalvation. How
ſhall they wound Jeſus Chriſt who dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for them? This ſurely cannot but
preſerve them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. We ſee every day this
conſideration failing alſo. There is
no child of God that is overcome of
temptation, but overcomes this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration.
It is not then a ſure and
infallible defenſative.</p>
            <p>2. This conſideration is twofold;
either it expreſſes the thoughts of the
ſoule with particular reference to the
Temptation contended withall; and
then it will not preſerve it: Or it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes
the univerſall habituall frame
of heart that is in us, upon all accounts,
and then it falleth in with what I ſhall
tender as the univerſall medicine and
remedy, in this caſe, in the proceſſe
of this diſcourſe; whereof after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.</p>
            <p>2. Conſider the <hi>power of Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
partly from what was ſhewed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
from the <hi>effects</hi> and fruites of
it, in the Saints of old; partly from
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:115354:33"/>
ſuch other <hi>effects</hi> in Generall as we find
aſcribed to it: as</p>
            <p>1. It will <hi>darken the mind,</hi> that a
man ſhall not be able to make a right
<hi>Judgement</hi> of things, ſo as he did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he entred into it. As in the
men of the world, the God of this
world <hi>blindes their mindes,</hi> that they
ſhould not ſee the <hi>Glory of Chriſt in the
Goſpel,</hi> 2 Cor. 4. 4. and <hi>whore dome, wine,
and new wine take away their hearts,</hi>
Ho. 4. 11. So it is in the nature of every
temptation more or leſſe, to take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
the heart, or to <hi>darken</hi> the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding
of the perſon tempted.</p>
            <p>And this it doth divers waies:</p>
            <p>1. By <hi>fixing</hi> the imagination, and
the thoughts, upon the <hi>object</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
it tends, ſo that the <hi>mind</hi> ſhall be
diverted from the conſideration of the
things that would reliefe and ſuccour
it in the <hi>ſtate</hi> wherein it is. A man is
tempted to apprehend that he is <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken
of God,</hi> that he is an object of
his hatred, that he hath no intereſt in
Chriſt; by the craft of Satan, the
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:115354:33"/>
mind ſhall be ſo <hi>fixed</hi> to the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of this <hi>ſtate</hi> and condition, with
the <hi>diſtreſſe</hi> of it, that he ſhall not be
able to mannage any of the reliefes
ſuggeſted, and tender'd to him againſt
it; but following the <hi>fullneſſe</hi> of his
owne thoughts, ſhall walk on in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
and have no light. I ſay a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation
will ſo poſſeſſe and fill the
mind with thoughtfullneſſe of its ſelfe;
and the matter of it, that it will take
off from that cleare conſideration of
things which otherwiſe it might, and
would have. And thoſe things where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
the mind was wont to have a vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
ſenſe, to keep it from ſinne, will
by this meanes come to have no <hi>force</hi>
nor efficacy with it: Nay it will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
bring men to that ſtate and
condition, that when <hi>others</hi> to whom
their eſtate is knowne, are ſpeaking
to them the things that concerne their
<hi>deliverance</hi> and peace, their minds
will be ſo poſſeſſed with the <hi>matter</hi> of
their temptation, as not at all to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand,
ſcarſe to heare one word that
is ſpoken to them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="58" facs="tcp:115354:34"/>
2. By <hi>woefull</hi> intangling of the
<hi>Affections,</hi> which when they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged,
what influence they have in
<hi>blinding</hi> the mind, and darkening the
underſtanding, is knowne: if any know
it not, let him but <hi>open</hi> his eyes, in
theſe daies, and he will quickly learne
it. By what waies and meanes it is,
that engaged Affections will <hi>becloude</hi>
the mind and darken it, I ſhall not now
declare. Only I ſay; give me a man in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
in <hi>hope, love, feare,</hi> in reference
to any particulars, wherein he ought
not, and I ſhall quickly ſhew you,
wherein he is darkened and blinded.
This then you will faile in, if you en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
into temptation: The <hi>preſent Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
you have of things, will not be
utterly altered, but darkened, and
render'd <hi>infirme,</hi> to influence the will,
and maſter the Affections; Theſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſet at liberty by Temptation, will
runne on in madneſſe. Forthwith de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation
of <hi>ſinne,</hi> abhorring of it, ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors
of the Lord, ſenſe of love, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
of Chriſt crucified all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:115354:34"/>
and leave the heart a prey to its
enemy.</p>
            <p>3. Temptation will give <hi>oyle</hi> and
fuell to our luſts, incite, provoke,
and make them tumultuate, and <hi>rage</hi>
beyond meaſure; Tendering a luſt, a
corruption, a ſutable object, advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,
occaſion, it heightens and exaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertes
it, makes it for a ſeaſon whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>predominant;</hi> ſo dealt it with <hi>car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
feare</hi> in <hi>Peter,</hi> with <hi>pride</hi> in <hi>Heze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiah,</hi>
with <hi>Coveteouſneſſe</hi> in <hi>Achan,</hi>
with <hi>uncleaneſſe</hi> in <hi>David,</hi> with world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe
in <hi>Demas,</hi> with <hi>Ambition</hi> in
<hi>Diotrephes;</hi> it will lay the reines on the
neck of a Luſt, and put <hi>ſpurs</hi> to the
ſides of it, that it may ruſh forward,
like an <hi>horſe</hi> into the battell. A man
knowes not the <hi>pride,</hi> fury, madneſſe
of a corruption, untill it meet with a
<hi>ſutable</hi> temptation. And what now
will a poore ſoule think to do! His
Mind is darkened, his Affections en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled,
his luſts enflamed, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked,
his <hi>reliefe</hi> is defeated, and
what will be the iſſue of ſuch a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="60" facs="tcp:115354:35"/>
3. Conſider that Temptations are
either <hi>publick or private;</hi> and let us a
litle view the efficacy, and power of
them apart.</p>
            <p>1. There are publick temptations;
ſuch as that mentioned, <hi>Revel.</hi> 3. 10.
that was to <hi>come upon the world to try
them that dwell upon the earth;</hi> or a
combination of perſecution and ſedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
for the triall of <hi>a Careleſſe Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi>
of profeſſors: now carrying ſuch
a Temptation; conſider, that</p>
            <p>1. It hath an <hi>Efficacy</hi> in reſpect of
God, who ſends it to <hi>revenge</hi> the neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
and <hi>contempt</hi> of the Goſpell on the
one hand; and <hi>treachery</hi> of falſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors
on the other. Hence it ſhall
certainely accompliſh what it receives
<hi>Commiſſion</hi> from him to do. When
<hi>Satan</hi> offers his <hi>ſervice</hi> to go forth
and ſeduce <hi>Ahab,</hi> that he might fall;
God ſaies to him thou ſhalt <hi>perſwade</hi>
him and <hi>prevaile</hi> alſo, <hi>go forth and do
ſo,</hi> 1 King. 22. 22, he is <hi>permitted</hi> as
to his <hi>wickedneſſe,</hi> and <hi>Commiſſiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi>
as to the event, and puniſhment
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:115354:35"/>
intended. When the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> world,
was to be given up to <hi>folly</hi> and falſe
worſhip, for their neglect of the <hi>truth,</hi>
and their naked, barren, fruitleſſe,
Chriſt-diſhonouring profeſſion; it is
ſaid of the Temptation that fell upon
them; that God <hi>ſent them ſtrong de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſions,
that they ſhould believe a lye,</hi>
2. Theſ. 2. 11. That, that <hi>comes</hi>
ſo from God in a <hi>judiciary</hi> manner,
hath a <hi>power</hi> with it, and ſhall prevaile;
That ſelfiſh, ſpiritually <hi>ſlothfull,</hi> care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
and worldly frame of ſpirit, which
in theſe daies hath infected almoſt the
<hi>body</hi> of profeſſors, if it have a <hi>Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion</hi>
from God, to <hi>kill</hi> hypocrities, to
<hi>wound</hi> negligent ſaints, to <hi>breake</hi> their
bones, and make them ſcandalous,
that they may be aſhamed, ſhall it not
have a power and efficacy ſo to do?
What work hath the <hi>ſpirit of error</hi>
made amongſt us? is it not from
hence; that as ſome men delighted not
to retaine God in their hearts ſo he
hath <hi>given them up to a reprobate mind,</hi>
Rom. 1. 28. A man would think it
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:115354:36"/>
ſtrange, yea it is matter of amazement,
to ſee perſons of a ſober ſpirit, preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to great things in the waies of
God, overcome, captivated, enſna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
deſtroyed, by weak meanes, <hi>ſot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh
opinions,</hi> fooliſh imaginations, ſuch
as a man would think it impoſſible that
they ſhould ever lay hold on ſenſible
or rationall men, much leſſe on pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors
of the Goſpell. But that which
God will have to be <hi>ſtrong,</hi> let us not
think <hi>weak?</hi> no ſtrength but the
ſtrength of God, can ſtand in the way
of the <hi>weakeſt</hi> things of the world,
that are commiſſionated from God,
for any end or purpoſe whatever.</p>
            <p>2. There is in <hi>ſuch</hi> Temptations,
the ſecret inſinuation of <hi>Examples</hi> in
thoſe that are accounted <hi>Godly,</hi> and
are profeſſours, <hi>Matth. 24. 12. Becauſe
iniquity ſhall abound the love of many
ſhall wax cold,</hi> &amp;c. the abounding of
iniquity in ſome will inſenſibly caſt
<hi>water</hi> on the zeale and love of others,
that by litle and litle it ſhall wax cold.
Some begin to grow <hi>negligent,</hi> care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:115354:36"/>
worldly, <hi>wanton;</hi> they breake
the <hi>ice</hi> towards the pleaſing of the
fleſh; at firſt others <hi>blame,</hi> judge
them, perhaps reprove them in a ſhort
ſpace their <hi>love</hi> alſo waxes cold, and
the brunt being over, they alſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
to them, and are caſt into the
ſame mould with them. <hi>A litle lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
leaveneth the whole lumpe, Paul</hi>
repeates this ſaying twice; 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 6.
and <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 9. He would have us take
<hi>notice</hi> of it, and it is of the danger of
the infection of the <hi>whole body</hi> from the
<hi>ill examples</hi> of ſome, whereof he
ſpeakes. We know how inſenſibly a
<hi>leaven</hi> proceedeth to give a ſavour to
the whole: So it is termed <hi>a roote of
bitterneſſe that ſpringeth up, and defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
many:</hi> Heb. 12. 15. If <hi>one</hi> litle
peice of <hi>leaven,</hi> if <hi>one</hi> bitter <hi>roote</hi> may
endanger the whole, how much more
when there are many <hi>roots</hi> of that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and much <hi>leaven</hi> is ſcattered a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad.
It is eaſy following a <hi>multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude</hi>
to do evill; and ſaying a conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy
to them to whom the people ſay
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:115354:37"/>
a conſpiracy. Would any one have
thought it poſſible, that <hi>ſuch</hi> and <hi>ſuch</hi>
profeſſors in our daies, ſhould have
fallen into waies of ſelfe, of fleſh, of
the world? to play at <hi>cards, dice, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell,
dance?</hi> to neglect family, clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet
duties, to be <hi>proud,</hi> haughty, am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious,
worldly, covetous, oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive?
or that they ſhould be turned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
after <hi>fooliſh,</hi> vaine, ridiculous o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions,
diſerting the Goſpell of
Chriſt? in which <hi>two,</hi> lyes the great
temptation that is come on us the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants
of this world to try us: but
doth not every man ſee, that this is
come to paſſe? and may we not ſee
how it is come to paſſe? Some looſe
empty profeſſors, that had never more
then a <hi>forme</hi> of Godlineſſe, when they
had ſerved their turne of that, began
the way to them; then others began
a litle to comply, and to pleaſe the
fleſh in ſo doing; this by litle and litle
hath reached even the <hi>top</hi> boughs and
branches of our profeſſion; untill al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
<hi>all fleſh</hi> hath corrupted its waies;
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:115354:37"/>
and he that departeth from theſe ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities,
makes his <hi>name</hi> a prey, if not
his perſon.</p>
            <p>3. Publicke Temptations are u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſually
accompanied with <hi>ſtrong reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings
and pretences,</hi> that are too hard
for men, or at leaſt inſenſibly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile
upon them, to an undervaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the evill whereunto the Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
leads, to give ſtrength to that
complicated temptation which in theſe
daies hath even caſt downe the People
of God, from their <hi>excellency,</hi> hath
cut their <hi>locks,</hi> and made them become
like other men; how full is the world
of ſpecious pretences and pleadings!
As there is the <hi>liberty</hi> and <hi>freedome</hi> of
Chriſtians, delivered from a bondage
frame; This is a <hi>doore</hi> that in my owne
obſervation, I have ſeene ſundry go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out at, into ſenſuality and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacy;
beginning at a light converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
proceeding to a neglect of the
ſabbath, publick and private duties,
ending in diſſoluteneſſe and profane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe;
and then there is leaving of <hi>pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:115354:38"/>
things</hi> to providence, being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
with what is; things Good in
themſelves, but diſputed into wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
carnall complyances, and the utter
ruine of all <hi>zeale</hi> for God, the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
of Chriſt, or his people in the
world. Theſe and the like conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations,
joyned with the <hi>eaſe,</hi> and
plenty, the <hi>greatneſſe</hi> and <hi>promotion</hi>
of profeſſors, have ſo brought things
about, that whereas we have by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
ſhifted <hi>places</hi> with the men of
the world, we have by ſinne, ſhifted
<hi>ſpirits</hi> with them alſo: We are like a
<hi>plantation</hi> of men, carried into a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne
country: in a ſhort <hi>ſpace</hi> they
degenerate from the manners of the
people from <hi>whence</hi> they came, and
fall into that of the country <hi>whereunto</hi>
they are brought; as if there were
ſomething in the ſoyle and the aire
that <hi>transformed</hi> them. Give me leave
a litle to follow my ſimilitude; He
that ſhould ſee the <hi>prevailing</hi> party
of theſe nations, many of thoſe in <hi>Rule,</hi>
power, favour with all their adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:115354:38"/>
and remember that they were
a <hi>colony</hi> of <hi>Puritans,</hi> whoſe habitation
was in a <hi>low place,</hi> as the prophet ſpeaks
of the city of God, tranſlated by an
high hand to the mountaines, they now
poſſeſſe; cannot but wonder, how
ſoone they have <hi>forgot</hi> the cuſtomes,
manners, waies, of their owne old
people, and are caſt into the mould
of them that went before them, in
the <hi>places</hi> whereunto they are tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
I ſpeak of us all; eſpecially of <hi>us,</hi>
who are amongſt the loweſt of the
people; where perhaps this iniquity
doth moſt abound. What were thoſe
before us, that we are not? What did
they, we do not? Proſperity hath
ſlaine the fooliſh, and wounded the
wiſe.</p>
            <p>2. Suppoſe the Temptation is
private; this hath been ſpoken to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore;
I ſhall adde two things,</p>
            <p>1. Its <hi>Union</hi> and <hi>incorporation</hi>
with luſt, whereby it gets within the
<hi>ſoule,</hi> and lyes at the bottome of its
actings. <hi>John</hi> tells us: 1 <hi>Epiſt. 2. 16.
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:115354:39"/>
that things that are in the world, are the
luſt of the fleſh, the luſt of the eyes, the
pride of life.</hi> Now it is evident that
all theſe things, are principally in the
<hi>ſubject,</hi> not in the <hi>object;</hi> in the <hi>heart,</hi>
not in the <hi>world.</hi> But they are ſaid
to be <hi>in the world,</hi> becauſe the <hi>world</hi>
gets into them; mixes its ſelfe with
them, <hi>unites,</hi> incorporates. As <hi>faith</hi>
and the <hi>promiſes</hi> are ſaid to be mixed,
<hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 2. So are <hi>luſt</hi> and <hi>Temptation</hi>
mixed; they twine together, receive
mutuall improvement from one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
grow each of them higher and
higher by the mutuall ſtrength, they
adminiſter to one another. Now by
this meanes temptation gets ſo deepe
in the heart, that no contrary reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings
can reach unto it; nothing but
what can kill the luſt, can conquer the
Temptation. Like <hi>leproſy</hi> that hath
mingled it ſelfe with the <hi>wall;</hi> the
<hi>wall</hi> its ſelfe muſt be pulled downe, or
the <hi>leproſy</hi> vvill not be cured. Like
a <hi>Gangreen</hi> that mixes poyſon vvith
the blood and ſpirits, and cannot be
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:115354:39"/>
ſeperated from the <hi>place</hi> vvhere it is;
but both muſt be cut off together.
For inſtance, in <hi>Davids</hi> Temptation
to <hi>uncleanneſſe: Ten thouſand</hi> conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
might have been taken in, to
ſtop the mouth of the Temptation;
but it had united its ſelfe vvith his <hi>luſt,</hi>
and nothing but the killing of that,
could deſtroy it, or get him the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt.
This deceives many a one: they
have ſome preſſing Temptation, that
having got ſome advantages is urgent
upon them: they pray againſt it, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
it vvith all povverfull conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;
ſuch, as vvhereof every one
ſeemes ſufficient to conquer and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy
it, at leaſt to overpovver it, that
it ſhould never be troubleſome any
more but no good is done, no ground
is got or obtained, yea it growes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them more and more: what is the
Reaſon of it? it hath <hi>incorporated</hi> and
united its ſelfe with the Luſt, and is
ſafe from all the oppoſition they
make. If they would make work in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
they are to ſet upon the whole
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:115354:40"/>
of the <hi>luſt</hi> its ſelfe; their ambition,
pride, worldlineſſe, ſenſuality, or
what ever it be, that the Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is united with. All other dealings
with it are like Temperings with a
prevailing <hi>gangreen;</hi> the part or whole
may be preſerved a litle while, in great
torment; <hi>Exciſion</hi> or death muſt come
at laſt. The ſoule may cruciate its ſelfe
for a ſeaſon, with ſuch a <hi>procedure;</hi>
but it muſt come to this, its luſt muſt
dye, or the <hi>ſoule</hi> muſt dye.</p>
            <p>2. In what part ſoever of the <hi>ſoule</hi>
the <hi>Luſt</hi> be ſeated wherewith the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation
is <hi>united,</hi> it drawes after it the
whole ſoule, by one meanes or other,
and ſo prevents or anticipates any op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition.
Suppoſe it be a <hi>luſt</hi> of the
mind; as there are luſts of the mind,
and uncleaneſſe of the ſpirit; ſuch as
<hi>Ambition,</hi> vaine glory, and the like;
what a world of waies hath the <hi>under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding</hi>
to bridle the <hi>Affections,</hi> that
they ſhould not ſo tenaciouſly cleave
to God, ſeeing in what it <hi>aimeth</hi> at,
there is ſo much to give them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:115354:40"/>
and ſatisfaction. It will not
only prevent all the Reaſonings of the
mind, which it doth neceſſarily, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
like a <hi>bloody</hi> infirmity in the <hi>eyes,</hi>
preſenting all things to the common
ſenſe and perception in that <hi>hue</hi> and
colour; but it will draw the whole
<hi>ſoule</hi> on other accounts, and collate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
conſiderations, into the ſame
frame. It promiſes the whole a ſhare
in the <hi>ſpoyle</hi> aimed at; as <hi>Judas</hi> his
money, that he firſt deſired from <hi>co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſſe,</hi>
was to be ſhared among
all his <hi>luſts.</hi> Or be it in the more ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuall
part, and firſt poſſeſſeth the <hi>Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections;</hi>
what prejudices they will
bring upon the <hi>underſtanding,</hi> how
they will bribe it to an acquieſcency,
what Arguments, what hopes they
will ſupply it withall cannot eaſily be
expreſſed; as was before ſhewed. In
briefe there is no <hi>particular Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
but, when it is in its <hi>houre,</hi> it hath
ſuch a contribution of aſſiſtance from
things <hi>Good, evill, indifferent,</hi> is fed
by ſo many conſiderations, that ſeeme
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:115354:41"/>
to be moſt alien and forraigne to it, in
ſome caſes hath ſuch ſpecious pleas
and pretences, that its <hi>ſtrength</hi> will
eaſily be acknowledged.</p>
            <p>5. Conſider the End of any Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation;
This is <hi>Satans</hi> end, and <hi>ſins</hi>
end; that is, the diſhonour of God, and
the ruine of our ſoules.</p>
            <p>6. Conſider what hath been the
<hi>iſſue</hi> of any former Temptations that
thou haſt had; have they not <hi>defiled</hi>
thy conſcience, <hi>diſquieted</hi> thy peace,
weakened thee in thy obedience, clou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
the face of God? though thou waſt
not prevailed on to the outward evill
or utmoſt iſſue of thy temptation; yet
haſt thou not been <hi>foiled,</hi> hath not thy
ſoul been <hi>ſullied</hi> and greviouſly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed
with it? yea dideſt thou ever in
thy life come fairly of without ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,

that thou hadſt to deale withall? And
And wouldſt thou willingly be intan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled
againe? if thou art at Liberty,
take heed, enter no more if it be poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
leſt a worſe thing happen to thee.</p>

               <pb n="73" facs="tcp:115354:41"/>
Theſe I ſay are ſome of thoſe many
conſiderations, that might be inſiſted
on, to manifeſt the importance of the
truth propoſed, and the fulneſſe of our
concernment, in taking care that we
enter not into temptation.</p>
            <p>Againſt it have been ſpoken, ſome
objections that ſecretly <hi>inſinuate</hi>
themſelves into the ſouls of men,
and have an efficacy to make them <hi>neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent</hi>
and careleſſe, in this thing which
is of ſuch importance to them; a duty
of ſuch <hi>indiſpenſable</hi> neceſſity to them
who intend to walke with God, in any
peace, or with any faithfulneſſe: which
objections are to be conſidered &amp; ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced:
and they are theſe that follow.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj:</hi> 1. Why ſhould we ſo feare,
and labour to avoid <hi>temptation?</hi> Jam.
1. 2. we are commanded to count it all
<hi>joy when we fall into divers temptations:</hi>
now certainly I need not ſolicitouſly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void
the <hi>falling</hi> into that, which when
I am <hi>fallen</hi> into, I am <hi>to count it all joy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ</hi> 1. You will not hold by
this <hi>Rule</hi> in all things: namely, that a
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:115354:42"/>
man need not <hi>ſeek</hi> to avoid that, which
when he cannot but <hi>fall</hi> into, it is his
duty to rejoyce therein. The ſame
Apoſtle bids the rich <hi>rejoyce that they
are made low,</hi> Chap. 1. 10. And with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
doubt to him who is acquainted
with the <hi>Goodneſſe</hi> and wiſdome, and
Love of God in his diſpenſations in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
condition that is needfull for him,
it will be a matter of <hi>rejoycing</hi> to him;
but yet how few <hi>rich Godly men</hi> can
you perſwade not to <hi>take heed,</hi> and
uſe all lawfull meanes that they be not
made poore and low; and in moſt ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
the truth is it were their ſinne, not
to doe ſoe. It is our buſineſſe to
make good our <hi>ſtations,</hi> and to ſecure
our ſelves as we can; if God alter our
condition, we are to <hi>rejoyce</hi> in it: if the
Temptations here mentioned <hi>befall
us,</hi> we may have cauſe to rejoyce; but
not if by a neglect of duty we <hi>fall</hi> into
them.</p>
            <p>2. Temptations are taken <hi>two</hi> wayes;</p>
            <p>1. Paſſively and merely <hi>material<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi>
for ſuch things, as are, or in ſome
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:115354:42"/>
caſes may be temptations; or 2. <hi>active<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>
for <hi>ſuch</hi> as do entiſe to ſinne: <hi>James</hi>
ſpeakes of temptations in the firſt
ſenſe only: for having ſaid, count it
all joy, when you <hi>fall into manifold
temptations,</hi> v. 2. he addes v. 12.
<hi>bleſſed is the man that endureth Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi>
for when he <hi>is tryed</hi> he ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the <hi>crowne</hi> of life. But now
whereas a man might ſay, if this be
ſo, then <hi>Temptations</hi> are <hi>good,</hi> and
from God; no ſayes <hi>James;</hi> Take
Temptation in ſuch a <hi>ſenſe,</hi> as that it
is a <hi>thing enticing</hi> and leading to ſinne
ſo <hi>God tempts none;</hi> but every man is
tempted of his own luſt. <hi>v.</hi> 13. 14.
To have ſuch temptations, to be <hi>tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted
to ſinne,</hi> that is not the bleſſed
thing I intend; but the <hi>enduring</hi>
of <hi>Afflictions</hi> that God ſends, for the
<hi>triall</hi> of our faith: that is a bleſſed thing:
ſo that though I muſt count it all <hi>joy,</hi>
when through the <hi>will</hi> of God I fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>divers</hi> Afflictions, for my tryall,
which yet have the matter of <hi>tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
in them, yet I am to uſe all care
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:115354:43"/>
and diligence, that my <hi>Luſt</hi> have no
occaſions or advantages given unto it,
to tempt me to ſinne.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> 2. But was not our <hi>Saviour
Chriſt</hi> himſelfe <hi>tempted;</hi> and is it evill
to be brought into the <hi>ſame ſtate</hi> and
condition with him? Yea it is not
only ſaid, that he was <hi>tempted:</hi> but his
being <hi>ſo,</hi> is expreſſed as a thing ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous,
and conducing to his <hi>mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifullneſſe</hi>
as our high Prieſt, <hi>Heb. 2.
17, 18. in that himſelfe hath ſuffered
being tempted, he is able to ſuccour them
that are tempted.</hi> And he makes it a
ground of a great promiſe, to his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
that they had <hi>abode with him
in his temptations,</hi> Luk. 22. 28.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> It is true! our Saviour was
tempted; but yet his <hi>temptations,</hi> are
reckoned among the <hi>evills</hi> that befell
him in the dayes of his fleſh; things
that came on him through the <hi>malice</hi>
of the world, and the <hi>Prince</hi> thereof.
He did not willfully caſt himſelfe <hi>into
temptation,</hi> which he ſaid was <hi>to tempt
the Lord our God,</hi> Math. 4. 7. as indeed
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:115354:43"/>
willingly to enter into any temptation
is highly to tempt God. Now our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
is ſo, that uſe the greateſt <hi>dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence</hi>
and watchfulneſſe that we can,
yet we ſhall be ſure to be <hi>tempted,</hi> and
be made like to Chriſt therein.</p>
            <p>This <hi>hinders</hi> not, but that it is our
duty to the utmoſt to prevent our <hi>fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
into</hi> them; and that namely on
this account. Chriſt had only the <hi>ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering</hi>
part of temptation, when he
entred into it, we have alſo the <hi>ſinning</hi>
part of it. When the <hi>Prince of this
world</hi> came to Chriſt he <hi>had no part in
him,</hi> but when he comes to us, he <hi>hath</hi>
ſo, in us; ſo that though in one effect
of Temptations; namely, trialls and
diſquietneſſe; we are made like to
Chriſt and ſo are to rejoyce, as far as
by any meanes that is produced; yet
by another, we are made <hi>unlike</hi> to him,
which is our being <hi>defiled</hi> and entan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled,
and are therefore to ſeek by all
meanes to avoid them, we never come
of like Chriſt: who of us enter into
temptation and are not defiled?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="78" facs="tcp:115354:44"/>
3. Obj: <hi>But what need this great
indeavour and carefulneſſe? is it not
ſaid that</hi> God is faithfull, who will not
ſuffer us to be tempted above what we are
able, <hi>but</hi> will with the temptation alſo
make a way to eſcape? 1 <hi>Cor. 10. 13. and</hi>
he knoweth how to deliver the Godly out
of temptation, 2 <hi>Pet. 2. 9: what need
we then be ſolticious that</hi> we enter <hi>not
into them?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> I much queſtion what Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
he will have from God in his
Temptation, who willingly <hi>enters into
it,</hi> becauſe he ſuppoſes God hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed
to deliver him <hi>out of it.</hi> The
Lord knowes, that through the craft
of <hi>Satan,</hi> the ſubtility and <hi>malice</hi> of the
world, the deceitfulneſſe of <hi>ſinne</hi> that
doth ſo <hi>eaſily beſet us,</hi> when we have
done our utmoſt, yet we ſhall <hi>enter</hi>
into divers temptations; in his Love,
Care, Tenderneſſe, and faithfulneſſe,
he hath <hi>provided</hi> ſuch a <hi>ſufficiency of
Grace</hi> for us, that they ſhall not utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
prevaile to make an everlaſting ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration
between him and our ſoules:
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:115354:44"/>
yet I have 3. things to ſay to this ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection.</p>
            <p>1. He that <hi>wilfully</hi> or negligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>enters</hi> into Temptation, hath no
reaſon in the world to promiſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
any aſſiſtance from God, or any
<hi>deliverance</hi> from the Temptation
wherinto he is entred.</p>
            <p>The promiſe is made to them whom
temptations doe <hi>befall</hi> in their way,
whether they will or no; not them that
wilfully fall into them, that runne out
of their way to meet with them. And
therefore the <hi>Divell</hi> (as is uſually ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved)
when he tempted our Saviour,
left out that expreſſion of the Text of
Scripture, which he wreſted to his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
<hi>all thy wayes:</hi> The promiſe of
deliverance is to them who are <hi>in their
wayes;</hi> whereof this is one principall,
to beware <hi>of Temptation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Though there be a ſufficiency of
Grace provided for all the <hi>Elect,</hi> that
they ſhall by no temptation fall <hi>utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>
from God; yet it would make any
gracious heart to <hi>tremble;</hi> to thinke
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:115354:45"/>
what <hi>diſhonour</hi> to God, what <hi>ſcandall</hi>
to the Goſpel, what woefull darkneſſe,
and diſquietneſſe they may bring upon
their own ſoules, though they periſh
not. And they who are <hi>ſcared</hi> by
nothing but <hi>feare</hi> of Hell, on whom o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
conſiderations ſhort thereof, have
no influence, in my apprehenſion, have
more reaſon to <hi>feare it,</hi> then perhaps
they are aware of.</p>
            <p>3. To enter on temptation on this
account, is to venture on ſinne (which
is the ſame with continuing in ſinne)
that Grace may abound; which the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle
rejects the thoughts of; with
greateſt deteſtation is it not a madneſſe
for a man willingly to ſuffer the <hi>ſhip</hi>
wherein he is to <hi>ſplit</hi> it ſelfe on a rock,<note place="margin">Rom. 6. 1, 2.</note>
to the irrecoverable loſſe of his <hi>mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize</hi>
becauſe he ſuppoſes he ſhall
in his own perſon <hi>ſwim</hi> ſafely to ſhore
on a planke? Is it leſſe in him, who
will hazard the <hi>ſhipwrack</hi> of all his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,
peace, joy, and ſo much of the
Glory of God, and honour of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell
as he is intruſted with, merely on
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:115354:45"/>
ſuppoſition that his ſoule ſhall yet <hi>eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape?</hi>
theſe things a man would thinke
did not deſerve to be <hi>mentioned;</hi> &amp; yet
with ſuch as theſe, doe poore ſoules
ſometimes delude themſelves.</p>

            <p>1. How a man may know, when he is
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:115354:46"/>
entred into temptation.</p>
            <p>2. What ſeaſons there are wherein a
man may, and ought to feare, that an
houre of temptation is at hand.</p>
            <p>3<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> What Directions are to be given,
for the preventing of our entring into
Temptation.</p>
            <p>How ſhall a man know whether he
be entred into temptation or no, is
our firſt enquiry: I ſay then,</p>
            <p>1. When a <hi>man is drawne into a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
ſinne, he may be ſure that he hath en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
into temptation.</hi> All <hi>ſinne</hi> is from
Temptation, <hi>James.</hi> 1. 14. Sinne is a
<hi>fruit,</hi> that comes only from that <hi>Root.</hi>
Though a man be never ſo <hi>ſuddenly,</hi>
or <hi>violently</hi> ſurprized in, or with any
ſinne, yet it is from ſome Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
or other, that he hath been ſo ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized:
ſo the Apoſtle, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 1. If
a man be <hi>ſurprized, overtaken</hi> with a
fault, yet he was <hi>tempted</hi> to it: for
ſayes He, <hi>conſider thy ſelfe leſt thou al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
be tempted,</hi> that is, <hi>as</hi> he was, when
he was ſo <hi>ſurprized,</hi> as it were at una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wares.
This men ſometimes take no
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:115354:46"/>
notice of, to their great diſadvantage;
When they are <hi>overtaken</hi> with a ſinne,
they ſet themſelves to <hi>repent</hi> of that
ſinne, but doe not conſider the <hi>tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation</hi>
that was the cauſe of it, to ſet
themſelves againſt that alſo; to take
care that they enter no more into it;
Hence are they <hi>quickly</hi> againe entan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled
by it; though they have the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
deteſtation of the ſinne it ſelfe,
that can be expreſſed. He that would
indeed get the Conqueſt over any ſin,
muſt conſider his <hi>Temptations to it,</hi> and
ſtrike at that <hi>root;</hi> Without delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
from thence, he will not be hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.</p>
            <p>This is a folly that poſſeſſes many,
who have yet a quick and living ſenſe
of ſinne: They are ſenſible of their
<hi>ſinnes,</hi> not of their <hi>temptations;</hi> are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed
with the <hi>bitter</hi> fruit, but cheriſh
the <hi>poyſonous</hi> root: Hence in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt
of their humiliations for ſinne,
they will continue in thoſe <hi>wayes,</hi> thoſe

2. Temptations have <hi>ſeverall</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees:
Some ariſe to ſuch an <hi>height,</hi>
doe ſo preſſe on the ſoule, ſo <hi>cruciate</hi>
and diſquiet it, ſo <hi>fight</hi> againſt all op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
that is made to it, that it muſt
needs be paſt all doubt to him who is
ſo aſſaulted, that it is a peculiar <hi>power of
temptation</hi> that he is to wreſtle withall.
When a <hi>feavour</hi> rages, a man knovves
he is <hi>ſick,</hi> unleſſe his diſtemper have
made him <hi>mad.</hi> The <hi>luſts</hi> of men as
<hi>James</hi> tels us, <hi>entiſe, draw away,</hi> &amp; <hi>ſeduce</hi>
them to ſin; but this they doe of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
without peculiar inſtigation, in
a more quiet, <hi>even,</hi> and <hi>ſedate</hi> manner;
if they grow <hi>violent,</hi> if they <hi>hurry</hi> the
ſoule up and downe, give it no reſt, the
ſoule may know that they have got the
<hi>help</hi> of temptation to this aſſiſiſtance.</p>
            <p>Take an empty <hi>veſſell,</hi> and put it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
ſome ſtreame, that is in its courſe to
the <hi>ſea;</hi> it will infallibly be carried thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,

of the ſtreame; But let ſtrong <hi>winds</hi>
ariſe upon it, it will be driven with vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
on every banke and <hi>rocke,</hi> untill
being broken in peices, it is ſwallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:115354:47"/>
up of the ocean. Mens <hi>luſts</hi> will
infallibly (if not mortified in the death
of Chriſt) carry them into <hi>eternall</hi>
ruine; but oftentimes without much
noyſe, according to the courſe of the
<hi>ſtream</hi> of their corruptions. But let the
wind of <hi>ſtrong</hi> temptations befal them,
they are hurried into innumerable ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous
ſins, and ſo broken upon all ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts,
are <hi>ſwallowed</hi> up in eternity; ſo is
it in generall with men; ſo in particular.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hezekiah</hi> had the roote of <hi>pride</hi> in
him alwayes, yet it did not make him
runne up and downe to ſhow his <hi>trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,</hi>
and his riches, untill he fell into
Temptation, by the <hi>Ambaſſadours</hi> of
the King off <hi>Babylon;</hi> ſo had <hi>David!</hi>
yet could he keep of from <hi>numbering</hi>
the people, untill <hi>Satan</hi> ſtood up and
provoked him, and ſolicited him to
doe it. <hi>Judas</hi> was covetous from
the beginning, yet he did not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive
to ſatisfie it, by ſelling of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,
untill the <hi>Devill entered into him,</hi>
and he thereby into Temptation. The
like may be ſaid of <hi>Abraham, Jonah,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:115354:48"/>
Peter</hi> and the reſt. So that when any
luſt or corruption whatever, tumul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuates
and diſquieteth the ſoule, puts
it with violence on ſinne; leſt the ſoule
know that it hath got the advantage of
ſome outward <hi>temptation,</hi> though as
yet, it perceiveth not wherein, or at
leaſt is become its ſelfe a peculiar tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation,
by ſome incitation or provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
that hath befallen it and is to be
looked to, more then ordinarily.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Entring</hi> into temptation may be ſeen
in the leſt degrees of it. As for inſtance
when the heart begins ſecretly to <hi>like</hi>
the <hi>matter</hi> of the temptation, and is
content to feed it, and encreaſe it by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
wayes that it may, without down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right
ſinne.</p>
            <p>1. Then, in particular, a man begins
to be in repute for <hi>piety, wiſdome, lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning</hi>
or the like: He is ſpoken of
much to that purpoſe. His heart is
tickled to heare of it, and his pride and
Ambition affected with it. If this man
now with all his ſtrength, ply the
things from whence his <hi>repute</hi> and
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:115354:48"/>
eſteeme and glory amongſt men do
ſpring, with a ſecret eye to have it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed,
he is <hi>entring</hi> into temptation,
which if he take not heed will quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
render him a <hi>ſlave</hi> of luſt. So was
it with <hi>Jehu,</hi> He perceived that his
repute for <hi>zeale</hi> began to grow abroad,
and he got honour by it; <hi>Jonadab</hi>
comes in his way; a good and holy
man; now thinks <hi>Jehu,</hi> I have an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
to grow in the honour of
my zeale: ſo he cals <hi>Jonadab</hi> to him,
and to worke he goes moſt ſeriouſly:
The things he did, were <hi>good</hi> in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
but he was <hi>entred into Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
and ſerved his luſt in all that he
did. So is it with many <hi>Schollars;</hi>
they find themſelves eſteemed and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
for their learning; this takes
hold of the pride and ambition of their
hearts; hence they ſet themſelves to
<hi>ſtudy</hi> with all diligence day and night;
a thing good in it ſelfe; but they doe
it, that they may ſatisfie the <hi>thoughts</hi>
and words of men wherein they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light,
and ſo in all they doe, they
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:115354:49"/>
make proviſion for the fleſh to fullfill
the luſts thereof.</p>
            <p>It is true! God oftentimes brings
light out of this darkneſſe; and turnes
things to a better iſſue. After it may
be a man hath ſtudied ſundry yeares,
with an eye upon his luſts; his <hi>ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
pride,</hi> and <hi>vaine glory;</hi> riſing ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and going to bed late to give them
ſatisfaction; God comes in with his
Grace; turnes the ſoule to himſelfe;
and ſo robbes thoſe <hi>Aegyptian</hi> luſts,
and ſo conſecrates that to the uſe of
the <hi>Tabernacle,</hi> which was provided
for Idols.</p>
            <p>Men may be thus entangled in better
things than <hi>learning;</hi> even in the <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſsion</hi>
of piety, in their labour in the
miniſtry, and the like.</p>
            <p>Some mens <hi>profeſſion is</hi> a ſnare to
them; they are in reputation, and are
much honoured on the account of their
<hi>profeſſion</hi> and ſtrict walking; This of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
fals out in the daies wherein we live,
wherein all things are carried by par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties;
ſome find themſelves on the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:115354:49"/>
mentioned perhaps to be the
<hi>darlings,</hi> and <hi>ingentia decora,</hi> or glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of their party; if thoughts hereof
ſecretly inſinuate themſelves into their
hearts, and influence them into more
then ordinary <hi>diligence,</hi> and <hi>activity</hi>
in their way and <hi>profeſſion,</hi> they are
entangled; and inſtead of ayming at
<hi>more glory,</hi> had need lye in the duſt, in
a ſenſe of their owne vileneſſe; and ſo
<hi>cloſe</hi> with this temptation; that often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
it requires no food to feed upon,
but that he who is intangled with it,
do <hi>avoid</hi> all meanes and waies of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
and reputation; ſo that it can but
whiſper in the heart, that, that avoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
is honorable; The ſame may be
the condition with men, as was ſaid,
in <hi>preaching the Goſpell,</hi> in the work of
the <hi>Miniſtry;</hi> many things in that work
may yeeld them eſteeme, their Ability,
their plaineſſe, their frequency, their
ſucceſſe; and all in this ſenſe may be
fuell unto temptations. Let then a
man know, that when he likes that
which <hi>feeds</hi> his luſt, and keeps it up,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:115354:50"/>
by waies either <hi>good</hi> in themſelves, or
not downe right ſinfull, he is entred
into Temptation.</p>
            <p>4. When by a mans ſtate or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of life, or any meanes whatever,
it comes to paſſe, that his Luſt, and
any <hi>Temptation</hi> meet with Occaſions
and Opportunities for its provocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and ſtirring up; Let that man know,
whether he perceive it or not, that he
is certainly <hi>entred</hi> into Temptation.
I told you before, that to <hi>enter into
temptation,</hi> is not meerly to be temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
but ſo to be under the <hi>power</hi> of
it, as to be intangled by it. Now
it is impoſſible almoſt, for a man to
have Opportunities, Occaſions, Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages
ſuited to his Luſt and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption,
but he will be intangled. If
<hi>Ambaſſadors</hi> come from the King of
<hi>Babilon, Hezekiahs</hi> pride will caſt him
into temptation. If <hi>Hazael</hi> be King
of <hi>Syria,</hi> his cruelty and Ambition
will make him to rage <hi>ſavagely</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<hi>Iſrael;</hi> if the <hi>Prieſts</hi> come with
their <hi>peices</hi> of ſilver, <hi>Judas</hi> his cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſſe
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:115354:50"/>
will inſtantly be at work to
ſell his Maſter; and many inſtances of
the like kind may in the daies where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
we live be given. Some men think
to play on the <hi>hole</hi> of the <hi>aſpe,</hi> and not
be <hi>ſtung,</hi> to touch <hi>pitch,</hi> and not be
defiled; to take <hi>fire</hi> in their cloaths,
and not be burnt; but they will be
miſtaken. If thy <hi>buſineſſe, courſe</hi> of
life, ſocieties, (or what ever elſe it be
of the like kind,) do caſt thee on ſuch
Things, Waies, Perſons, as ſuit thy
Luſt or corruption; know that thou
art <hi>entred</hi> into Temptation; how thou
wilt come out, God only knowes:
let us ſuppoſe a man that hath any
ſeeds of <hi>filthineſſe</hi> in his heart, engaged
in the courſe of his life, in ſociety,
<hi>light,</hi> vaine, and fooliſh; what notice
ſoever, litle, great, or none at all,
it be, that he takes of it; he is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly
entred into temptation; ſo
is it with <hi>ambition</hi> in high places; <hi>paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion</hi>
in a multitude of perplexing af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires;
<hi>polluted,</hi> corrupt <hi>fancy</hi> in vaine
ſocieties, and the peruſall of idle
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:115354:51"/>
books, or Treatiſes of vanity and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
fire and things combuſtible may
more eaſily be induced to lye toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
without affecting each other, then
<hi>peculiar</hi> luſts and <hi>ſuitable</hi> objects or
occaſions for their exerciſe.</p>
            <p>5. When a man is <hi>weakened,</hi> made
negligent, or <hi>formall</hi> in duty, when
he can omit duties, or content him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
with a careleſſe, <hi>lifeleſſe</hi> perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance
of them, without <hi>delight,</hi> joy,
or ſatisfaction to his ſoule, who had
another frame formerly; let him know,
that though he may not be acquainted
with the <hi>particular diſtemper,</hi> wherein
it conſiſts; yet in ſomething or other,
he is entred into <hi>Temptation,</hi> which
at the length he will find evident to
his trouble and perill. How many have
we ſeene, and knowne in our daies,
who from a <hi>warme</hi> profeſſion, have
fallen to be negligent, careleſſe, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different
in <hi>Praying, Reading, Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
and the like? give an inſtance of
<hi>one</hi> who hath come off without a
<hi>wound,</hi> and I dare ſay you may find
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:115354:51"/>
out an hundred for him that have ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted
themſelves to have been <hi>a
ſleepe on the top of the maſt;</hi> that they
were in the jaws of ſome vile Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
or other, that afterwards
brought forth <hi>bitter fruit</hi> in their lives
and waies: from ſome few Returnes,
from folly, we have every day theſe
dolefull complaints made. Oh I neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected
<hi>private prayer,</hi> I did not <hi>meditate</hi>
on the <hi>Word,</hi> nor attend to <hi>hearing;</hi> but
rather deſpiſed theſe things, &amp; yet ſaid
I was <hi>rich,</hi> and <hi>wanted</hi> nothing: litle
did I conſider, that this <hi>uncleane luſt</hi>
was ripening in my heart, this <hi>Atheiſme,</hi>
theſe Abominations were fomenting
there. This is a certaine rule; if his heart
grow <hi>cold, negligent,</hi> or formall in du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of the worſhip of God, and that
either as to the matter, or manner of
them, who hath had another frame,
one Temptation or other, hath laid
hold upon him. World, or pride,
or uncleaneſſe, or ſelfe ſeeking, or
malice and envy, or one thing or other,
hath poſſeſſed his ſpirit; <hi>gray haires
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:115354:52"/>
are here and there upon him,</hi> though
he perceive it not. And this is to be
obſerved as to the <hi>manner</hi> of duties,
as well as to the <hi>matter.</hi> Men may
upon many ſiniſter accounts, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
for the <hi>ſatisfaction of their conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences,</hi>
keep up, and <hi>frequent duties</hi> of
Religion, as to the <hi>ſubſtance</hi> and <hi>mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
of them; when they have <hi>no heart</hi>
to them, no life in them, as to the <hi>ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituality</hi>
required in their performance.
<hi>Sardis</hi> kept up the performance of du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
and had therefore a <hi>name to live;</hi>
but it wanted <hi>ſpirituall life</hi> in their
performance and was therefore <hi>dead,
Rev.</hi> 3. 1. As it is in diſtempers of
the <hi>body;</hi> if a man find his ſpirits faint,
his Heart oppreſſed, his Head heavy,
the whole perſon indiſpoſed, though
he do not yet actually <hi>burne,</hi> nor <hi>rave;</hi>
yet he will cry, I feare I am <hi>entering
into a feaver;</hi> I am ſo out of <hi>order</hi> and
indiſpoſed. A man may do ſo in this
<hi>ſickneſſe</hi> of the ſoule, If he find his <hi>pulſe</hi>
not beat aright, and evenly towards
<hi>duties</hi> of worſhip, and communion
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:115354:52"/>
with God, if his <hi>ſpirit</hi> be <hi>low,</hi> and
his heart faint in them, let him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
though his <hi>luſt</hi> doth not yet
<hi>burne</hi> nor <hi>rage,</hi> that he is entered into
Temptation, and it is high time for
him to conſider the particular Cauſes
of his diſtemper. If the <hi>head</hi> be <hi>hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy,</hi>
and <hi>ſlumber</hi> in the things of Grace,
if the <hi>heart</hi> be <hi>cold</hi> in duties, evill lies
at the doore. And if ſuch a ſoule do
eſcape a great Temptation unto <hi>ſinne,</hi>
yet it ſhall not eſcape a great tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
by <hi>deſertion.</hi> The <hi>ſpouſe</hi> cries, <hi>I
ſleepe,</hi> Cant. 5. 2. and that ſhe <hi>had put
off her coat, and could not put it on;</hi> had
an indiſpoſition to duties, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
with Chriſt. What is the
<hi>next newes,</hi> you have of her <hi>verſ. 6.
her beloved had withdrawne himſelfe;</hi>
Chriſt was gone, and ſhee ſeeks him
<hi>long</hi> and finds him not. There is ſuch
a <hi>ſuitableneſſe</hi> between the <hi>new nature</hi>
that is wrought and created in belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
and the duties of the worſhip of
God, that they will not be <hi>parted</hi> nor
<hi>kept</hi> aſunder, unleſſe it be by the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:115354:53"/>
of ſome diſturbing diſte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>per.
The new creature feeds upon them,
is ſtrengthened and increaſed by them,
finds ſweetneſſe in them, yea meets in
them with its God and Father; ſo that
it cannot but of its ſelfe, unleſſe made
ſick by ſome temptation, but delight
in them, and deſire to be in the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe
of them; This frame is deſcribed
in the 119<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
               <hi>Pſalme</hi> throughout. It is
not I ſay caſt out of this frame and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
unleſſe it be oppreſſed, and diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd,
by one ſecret Temptation or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
Sundry other evidences there are
of a ſoules entring into temptation,
which upon enquiry it may diſcover.</p>
            <p>I propoſe this to take off the <hi>ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi>
that we are apt to fall into; and to
manifeſt what is the peculiar <hi>duty</hi> that
we are to apply our ſelves unto in the
ſpeciall ſeaſons of Temptation. For
he that is already <hi>entred into temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
is to apply himſelfe unto meanes for
disintanglement, not to labour to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
his entering in. How this may be
done I ſhall afterwards declare.</p>

            <p>Our ſecond enquiry is; what <hi>gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
directions</hi> may be given to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
a ſoule from that condition that
hath been ſpoken of. And we ſee our
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:115354:54"/>
Saviours direction in the place ſpoken
of before, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26. 41. He ſums
up all in theſe two words <hi>Watch,</hi> and
<hi>Pray;</hi> I ſhall a little labour to <hi>unfold</hi>
them, and ſhew what is enwrapped and
contained in them: and that both joint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and ſeverally.</p>
            <p>1. There is included in them, a
cleare <hi>abiding</hi> Apprehenſion of the
<hi>great evill</hi> that there is in entering in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Temptation. That which a man
<hi>watches,</hi> and <hi>prayes</hi> againſt. He looks
upon as <hi>evill</hi> to him, and by all meanes
to be avoided.</p>
            <p>This then is the <hi>firſt direction; Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
beare in mind, the great danger
that it is, for any ſoule to enter into
Temptation.</hi> It is a woefull thing to
conſider what ſlight thoughts the
moſt have of this thing: ſo men can
keep themſelves from <hi>ſinne</hi> it ſelfe,
in open action, they are content, they
ſcarce aime at more; on <hi>any</hi> Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
in the world, <hi>all</hi> ſorts of men
will venture at any time.</p>
            <p>How will <hi>young men</hi> put themſelves
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:115354:54"/>
on any <hi>company,</hi> any ſociety; at firſt
being delighted with <hi>evill company,</hi>
then with the <hi>evill</hi> of the <hi>company.</hi>
How vaine are all Admonitions, and
Exhortations to them, to take heed
of <hi>ſuch,</hi> or ſuch perſons, debauched
in themſelves, corrupters of others,
deſtroyers of ſoules? at firſt they will
venture on the company, abhorring
the thoughts of practiſing; their lewd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe:
but what is the iſſue? unleſſe it
be here or there one, whom God <hi>ſnat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches</hi>
with a mighty hand, from the
jawes of deſtruction, they are all loſt,
and become after a while in love with
the <hi>evill,</hi> which at firſt they abhorred.
This open doore, to the <hi>ruine</hi> of ſoules,
is too evident; and woefull experience
makes it no leſſe evident, that it is
almoſt impoſſible to faſten upon ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
poore creatures, any feare or dread
of <hi>Temptation,</hi> who yet will profeſſe a
<hi>feare,</hi> and abhorrency of <hi>ſin.</hi> Would
it were only thus with young men; ſuch
as are <hi>unaccuſtomed</hi> to the yoke of the
Lord. What ſort of man is free from
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:115354:55"/>
this folly in one thing or other?</p>
            <p>How many profeſſors have I known
that would plead for their <hi>Liberty</hi> as
they called it. They could <hi>heare</hi> any
<hi>thing,</hi> all things; all <hi>ſorts</hi> of men, all
men; they would <hi>try all things,</hi> whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they come to them, in the way
of God or no; and on that account
would runne to <hi>heare</hi> and to attend to
every broacher of falſe and abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
opinions; every ſeducer though
ſtigmatized by the generality of the
Saints, for ſuch a one they had their
<hi>liberty,</hi> they could do it; but the <hi>opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions</hi>
they hated as much as any; what
hath been the iſſue? I ſcarce ever
knew any come off without a <hi>wound;</hi>
the moſt have had their <hi>faith over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwne:</hi>
Let no man then pretend to
<hi>feare ſinne,</hi> that doth not <hi>feare temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation</hi>
to it. They are too nearely al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly'd,
to be ſeperated. Satan hath put
them <hi>ſo together</hi> that it is very hard,
for any man to put them <hi>aſunder:</hi> He
hates not the fruit, who delights in the
root.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="101" facs="tcp:115354:55"/>
When men ſee, that ſuch waies,
ſuch companies, ſuch <hi>courſes,</hi> ſuch
buſineſſes, ſuch ſtuddies and <hi>aymes</hi> do
entangle them, make them <hi>cold,</hi> care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe,

them to even, univerſall, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant

owne weakneſſe, and corruption, of
the <hi>craft</hi> of Satan, of the <hi>evill</hi> of ſin,
of the efficacy of Temptation, that
can performe this duty. And yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till
we bring our hearts to <hi>this frame,</hi>
upon the conſiderations before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned,
or the like that may be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
we ſhall never free our ſelves
from <hi>ſinnefull</hi> intanglements.</p>
            <p>Boldneſſe upon temptation, ſpring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from ſeverall pretences; hath as is
knowne ruined <hi>innumerable</hi> profeſſors
in thoſe daies; and ſtill continues to
caſt <hi>many downe</hi> from their Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy;
nor have I the leaſt hope of a more

            </p>
            <p>This is the firſt thing enwrapped in
this Generall <hi>direction;</hi> The daily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe
of our thoughts with an appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion
of the great danger that lyes
in entring into Temptation is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
of us. <hi>Griefe</hi> of the ſpirit of God,
diſquietment of our <hi>owne ſoules,</hi> loſſe
of peace, Hazard of <hi>eternall welfare,</hi>
lyes at the doore: If the ſoule be not
prevailed withall, to the obſervation
of this <hi>direction,</hi> all that enſues, will
be of no value; Temptation deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
will conquer: and if the heart be
made tender and watchfull here, halfe
the work of <hi>ſecuring a Good Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
is over. And let not him go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

this direction in a <hi>daily Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entious</hi>
obſervation of it.</p>
            <p>2. There is this in it alſo, That
it is <hi>not</hi> a thing in our owne power to
<hi>keep</hi> and <hi>preſerve</hi> our ſelves from en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring
into temptation. Therefore are
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:115354:56"/>
we to <hi>pray</hi> that we may be preſerved

As we have no ſtrength, to
reſiſt a Temptation when it doth come,
when <hi>we are entred</hi> into it, but ſhall
fall under it, without a ſupply of <hi>ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency
of Grace</hi> from God, ſo to <hi>reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
that we have no <hi>power</hi> or wiſdome
to keep our ſelves from <hi>entring</hi> into
temptation, but muſt be kept by the
<hi>power</hi> and wiſdome of God, is a preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
principle, 1 <hi>Pet. 1. 5. We are</hi> in
all things <hi>kept by the power of God.</hi>
This our Saviour inſtructs us in, not
only by <hi>directing</hi> us to <hi>pray</hi> that we
be not <hi>lead</hi> into temptation; but alſo
by his owne <hi>praying</hi> for us, that we
may be kept from it. <hi>Joh. 17. 15. I
pray not that thou ſhouldeſt take them
out of the world, but that thou ſhouldeſt
keep them from the evill:</hi> That is the
Temptations of the world, unto evill,
unto ſinne, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, out of the <hi>evill</hi>
that is in the world, that is <hi>Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
which is all that is <hi>evill</hi> in the world;
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:115354:57"/>
or from the <hi>evill one,</hi> who <hi>in the world,</hi>
makes uſe <hi>of the world,</hi> unto Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.
Chriſt prays his Father to
<hi>keep</hi> us; and inſtructs us to pray that
we be <hi>ſo kept;</hi> it is not then a thing in
our owne power. The <hi>waies</hi> of our
entring into temptation are <hi>ſo many,</hi>
various, and imperceptible; the <hi>meanes</hi>
of it, ſo efficacious and powerfull, the
<hi>entrances</hi> of it ſo deceitfull, ſubtile,
inſenſible, and plauſible; our <hi>weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,</hi>
our unwatchfulneſſe ſo unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
that we cannot in the leaſt <hi>keep
or preſerve</hi> our ſelves from it: we faile
both in <hi>wiſdome</hi> and <hi>power</hi> for this
work.</p>
            <p>Let the heart then <hi>commune</hi> with its
ſelfe and ſay, I am <hi>poore</hi> and <hi>weake,</hi> Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan
is ſubtile, cunning, powerfull,
watching conſtantly for Advantages
againſt my ſoule; the <hi>world</hi> earneſt,
preſſing, and full of ſpecious pleas, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable
pretences, and waies of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit;
my owne <hi>corruption</hi> violent and
tumultuating, enticing, <hi>entangling,</hi>
conceiving ſinne, and warring in me, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:115354:57"/>
me. <hi>Occaſions</hi> and advantages
of Temptation innumerable in all
things, I have, done, or ſuffer, in all
buſineſſes and perſons with whom I
converſe.</p>
            <p>The firſt beginnings of <hi>Temptation</hi>
inſenſible and plauſible; ſo that left
unto my ſelfe I ſhall not know that I
am <hi>enſnared,</hi> untill my bonds be made
ſtrong, and ſinne hath got ground in
my heart; therefore on God alone
will I rely for <hi>preſervation,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
will I look up to him, on
that account; This will make the ſoule
be alwaies committing its ſelfe to the
<hi>care</hi> of God, reſting its ſelfe on him;
and to do nothing, undertake nothing
&amp;c: without asking counſell of him.
So that a double Advantage will ariſe
from the Obſervation of this <hi>directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
both of ſingular uſe for the ſoules
<hi>preſervation</hi> from the evill feared.</p>
            <p>Firſt, The engagement of the grace
and compaſſion of God, who hath cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
the <hi>Fatherleſſe,</hi> and <hi>helpleſſe</hi> to reſt
upon him; nor did ever ſoule faile
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:115354:58"/>
of ſupplys who in a ſenſe of want, rol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
its ſelfe on him, on the account
of his gratious invitation.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the <hi>keeping</hi> of it in ſuch
a frame, as on various accounts, is
uſefull for its preſervation; He that
looks to God for aſſiſtance, in a due
manner, is both <hi>ſenſible</hi> of his danger,
and conſcientiouſly <hi>carefull</hi> in the uſe
of meanes to preſerve himſelfe, which
tvvo, of vvhat importance they are in
this <hi>caſe,</hi> may eaſily be apprehended,
by them vvho have their hearts ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed
in theſe things.</p>
            <p>3. This alſo is in it, Act, <hi>Faith</hi> on the
<hi>promiſe</hi> of God for preſervation: To
<hi>believe</hi> that he vvill preſerve us, is a
meanes of preſervation. For this God
vvill certainly doe, or make avvay for
us, to <hi>escape</hi> out of Temptation if vve
fall into it, under ſuch a <hi>believing</hi>
frame. We are to <hi>pray</hi> for vvhat God
hath promiſed. Our requeſts are to
be regulated by his promiſes, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,
vvhich are of the ſame extent,
faith cloſes vvith the promiſes, and
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:115354:58"/>
ſo finds reliefe in this caſe. This
<hi>James</hi> inſtructs us in, <hi>Ch.</hi> 1. 5, 7. What
we vvant vve muſt <hi>aske</hi> of God: but
vve muſt aske it in <hi>faith,</hi> for othervviſe
vve muſt not <hi>think that we ſhall receive
any thing of the Lord.</hi> This then al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
is in this direction of our Saviour;
that vve act <hi>Faith</hi> on the promiſes of
God, for our preſervation out of Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation.
He hath promiſed that he
will <hi>keep</hi> us in all our wayes; that we
ſhall be <hi>directed</hi> in a way, that though
we are <hi>fooles, we ſhall not erre in it,</hi>
Iſa. 55. 8. that he will lead us, guide us,
and deliver us from the evill one. Set
faith on worke on theſe promiſes of
God, and expect a good and comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
iſſue. It is not eaſily conceived
what a traine of Graces, faith is atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
withall,<note place="margin">Mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſin in Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.</note> when it goes forth to meet
Chriſt in the promiſes: nor what a
power for the preſervation of the ſoul,
lyes in this thing: But I have ſpoken
to this elſevvhere.</p>
            <p>4. Weigh theſe things <hi>ſeverally,</hi>
and 1. take prayer into conſideration,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:115354:59"/>
to <hi>pray that we enter not into Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
is a meanes to preſerve us from
it. Glorious things are by all men,
that know ought of thoſe things ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
of this <hi>duty;</hi> &amp; yet the truth is, not
<hi>one halfe</hi> of its Excellency, power, and
efficacy is knowne. It is not my bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe,
to ſpeake of it in Generall; but
this I ſay as to my preſent purpoſe;
he that would be <hi>little in temptation, let
him be much in prayer.</hi> This calls in the
<hi>ſutable help</hi> &amp; ſuccour that is laid up in
Chriſt for us, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 16. This caſteth
our ſoules into a <hi>frame</hi> of oppoſition
to every Temptation. When <hi>Paul</hi> had
given inſtruction for the taking to our
ſelves the <hi>whole armour of God,</hi> that we
may reſiſt and ſtand in a time of Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation,
he addes this generall cloſe
of the whole, <hi>Ep. 6. 18. praying al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
with all prayer and ſupplication
in the ſpirit, and watching thereunto,
with all perſeverance, and ſupplication.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Without this all the reſt will
be of no efficacy for the end propoſed.
And therefore conſider what weight he
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:115354:59"/>
layes on it: <hi>praying alwaies!</hi> that is at
all times and ſeaſons, or be alwaies rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
and prepared for the diſcharge of
that duty, <hi>Luk. 18. 1. 1 Theſ. 5. 14.
with all prayer and ſupplications in the
ſpirit;</hi> putting forth all kindes of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires
unto God, that are ſuited to our
condition, according to his will, and
which we are aſſiſted in by the Spirit,
<hi>and watching thereunto,</hi> leſt we be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted,
by any thing what ever; and
that not for a little while, but <hi>with all
perſeverance;</hi> continuance lengthned
out to the utmoſt ſo ſhall <hi>we ſtand.</hi> The
ſoule ſo <hi>framed,</hi> is in a ſure poſture;
and this is one of the meanes without
which this worke will not be done.
If we doe not <hi>abide</hi> in <hi>prayer,</hi> we ſhall
<hi>abide</hi> in curſed <hi>Temptations.</hi> Let this
then be another direction. Abide <hi>in
prayer!</hi> and that expreſſly to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe;
that we enter not into Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions:
Let this be one part of our day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
contending with God: that he would
preſerve <hi>our ſoules;</hi> and <hi>keep our hearts,</hi>
and our wayes, that we be not <hi>entan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled;</hi>
               <pb n="110" facs="tcp:115354:60"/>
that his <hi>good</hi> and wiſe providence
will order our wayes, and affaires that
no preſſing temptation befall us, that
he would give us diligence, careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
watchfulneſſe, over our own
waies: ſo ſhall we be delivered, when
others are held with the cords of their
own folly.</p>

There are ſundry <hi>ſeaſons,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
an <hi>houre of Temptation</hi> is common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
at hand; and will unavoidably ſeize
upon the <hi>ſoule,</hi> unleſſe it be delivered
by mercy in the uſe of watchfulneſſe.
When we are under ſuch a <hi>ſeaſon,</hi> then
are we peculiarly to be upon our guard,
that we enter not into, that we fall not
under the power of Temptation. Some
of thoſe <hi>ſeaſons</hi> may be named.</p>
            <p>1. A <hi>ſeaſon</hi> of <hi>unuſuall</hi> outward
proſperity is <hi>uſually</hi> accompanied with
an houre of Temptation. Proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and temptation goe together; yea
proſperity is a temptation; many tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations;
and that becauſe without e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent
ſupplies of Grace, it is apt to
caſt a ſoule into a <hi>frame</hi> &amp; temper ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
to any Temptation, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vides
it will fuell and food for all; it
hath proviſion for <hi>luſt;</hi> and <hi>darts</hi> for
<hi>Sathan.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The wiſe man tells us, that the <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity
of fooles deſtroys them,</hi> Prov. 1.
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:115354:61"/>
31. it <hi>hardens</hi> them in their way, makes
them <hi>deſpiſe</hi> inſtruction, and put the

it hath an inconceivably ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant

Hence <hi>Agur</hi> prayes againſt

Prov. 30. 8, 9. Leſt, being <hi>filled</hi> with

God complaines that his people did,
<hi>Hoſ.</hi> 13. 6. We know how <hi>David</hi>
was miſtaken in this caſe, <hi>Pſal. 30. 6.
I ſaid in my proſperity I ſhall never be
moved:</hi> all is well, and will be well,
but what was at hand, what lay at the
doore, that <hi>David</hi> thought not of?
<hi>verſ. 7. Thou diddeſt hide thy face, and
I was troubled:</hi> God was ready to <hi>hide</hi>
his face, and <hi>David</hi> to enter into a
temptation of deſertion, and he knew
it not.</p>
            <p>As then unto a <hi>proſperous</hi> condition.
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:115354:61"/>
I ſhall not run croſſe to <hi>Solomons</hi> coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell,

Eccleſ. 7. 14. Rejoyce in the God

hath many advantages againſt him,
He forgeth darts out of all his enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and if he watch not, he will
be entangled before he is aware.</p>
            <p>Thou wanteſt that which ſhould
<hi>poyſe</hi> and ballaſt thy heart. Formality
in Religion will be apt to creep upon
thee, and that layes the ſoule open
to all Temptations in their full power
and ſtrength. Satisfaction and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
in <hi>creature comforts,</hi> the poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of the ſoule will be apt to grow
upon thee. In ſuch a time, be vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant,
be circumſpect, or thou wilt be
ſurprized. <hi>Job</hi> ſayes, that in his <hi>Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction
God made his heart ſoft,</hi> Ch.
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:115354:62"/>
23. 16. There is an <hi>hardneſſe,</hi> an inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
want of ſpirituall ſenſe, gathered
in <hi>proſperity,</hi> that if not <hi>watched</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt,
will expoſe the heart to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits
of ſin &amp; baits of Sathan: Watch
and pray in this ſeaſon: Many mens
negligence in it, hath coſt them deare,
their woefull experience cryes out, to
take heed. Bleſſed is he that feareth
alwaies; but eſpecially in a time of
<hi>proſperity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. As in part was manifeſted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
A Time of the <hi>ſlumber</hi> of Grace,
of neglect in <hi>Communion</hi> with God, of
formality in duty is a <hi>ſeaſon</hi> to be
watched in, as that which hath certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſome other temptation attending
it. Let a ſoule in ſuch an eſtate awake,
and looke about him; his enemy is at
hand, and he is ready to fall into ſuch
a condition as may coſt him deare all
the dayes of his life: His preſent e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate
is <hi>bad</hi> enough in its ſelfe; but it
is an indication of that which is <hi>worſe,</hi>
that lyes at the doore.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Diſciples</hi> that were with Chriſt;
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:115354:62"/>
in the mount, had not only a <hi>bodily,</hi>
but a <hi>ſpirituall</hi> drowzineſſe upon them.</p>
            <p>What ſayes our Saviour to them?
<hi>ariſe, watch and pray, that you enter
not into temptation.</hi> We know, how
neare <hi>one</hi> of them was to a bitter houre
of temptation; and not watching as he
ought, he immediately <hi>entred</hi> into it.</p>
            <p>I mentioned before the <hi>caſe</hi> of the
<hi>ſpouſe,</hi> Cant. 5. 2, 3, 4, 5. ſhe <hi>ſlept,</hi>
and was <hi>drowſy,</hi> and unwilling to gird
up her ſelfe to a <hi>vigorous</hi> performance
of duties, in a way of quick active
<hi>communion</hi> with Chriſt. Before ſhe
is aware, ſhe hath <hi>loſt</hi> her beloved; then
ſhe <hi>meanes,</hi> enquires, cryes, endures
woundings, reproaches, and all, before
ſhe obtaines him againe. Conſider
then O poore ſoule, thy ſtate and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition!
doth thy light <hi>burne</hi> dimme?
or though it give to others as great a
<hi>blaze,</hi> as formerly, yet thou ſeeſt not
ſo clearly the <hi>face</hi> of God in <hi>Chriſt,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Cor. 4. 6.</note>
by it as thou haſt done? is thy <hi>zeale</hi>
cold? or if it doe the <hi>ſame workes</hi> as
formerly, yet thy heart is not warmed
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:115354:63"/>
with the Love <hi>of</hi> God, and <hi>to</hi> God,
in them as formerly, but only thou
proceedeſt in the courſe thou haſt
been in? art thou negligent in duties of
<hi>praying</hi> or hearing? or if thou doſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
them, thou doeſt it not with that
life and vigour as formerly? Doſt
thou <hi>flagge</hi> in thy profeſſion? or if
thou keep it up, yet thy wheeles are
oyled by ſome <hi>ſiniſter</hi> reſpects from
within or without? does thy delight
in the people of God faint and grow
cold? or is thy <hi>love</hi> to them changing
from that which is purely <hi>ſpirituall,</hi>
into that which is very carnall, upon
the account of ſutableneſſe of princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
and naturall ſpirits, if not worſe
foundations? if thou art <hi>drowſing</hi> in
ſuch a condition as this; take heed!
thou art falling into ſome wofull
temptation, that will break all thy
bones, and give thee wounds that ſhall
ſtick by thee all the dayes of thy life.
Yea when thou <hi>awakeſt</hi> thou wilt find,
that it hath indeed laid hold of thee al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready,
though thou perceivedſt it not;
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:115354:63"/>
it hath <hi>ſmitten</hi> and wounded thee,
though thou haſt not complained, nor
ſought for <hi>reliefe</hi> or <hi>healing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Such was the ſtate of the <hi>Church of
Sardis,</hi> Rev. 3. 2. the things that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained
were <hi>ready to dye:</hi> be <hi>watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full</hi>
ſayes our Saviour and <hi>ſtrengthen</hi>
them, or a worſe thing will befall thee:
if any that reads the word of this dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
be in this condition, if he hath
any regard of his poore ſoule, let him
now <hi>awake,</hi> before he be entangled be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
recovery. Take this warning
from God; deſpiſe it not.</p>
            <p>3. A ſeaſon of <hi>great ſpirituall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments,</hi>
is often by the malice of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan,
and the weakneſſe of our hearts,
turned into a ſeaſon of danger: as to
this buſineſſe of Temptation.</p>
            <p>We know how the caſe ſtood with
<hi>Paul,</hi> 2 Cor. 12. 7. he had glorious
ſpirituall Revelations of God, &amp; Jeſus
Chriſt; inſtantly <hi>Satan</hi> fals upon him;
a meſſenger from him buffets him, ſo
that he earneſtly begges its departure;
but yet is left to <hi>ſtruggle</hi> with it.
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:115354:64"/>
God is pleaſed ſometimes to give us
<hi>eſpeciall diſcoveries</hi> of himſelfe and his
love; to fill the heart with his kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe:
Chriſt takes us into the <hi>ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queting
houſe,</hi> and gives our hearts
their fills of love; and this by ſome
ſignall worke of his ſpirit, overpow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ering
us with a <hi>ſenſe of Love,</hi> in the
unſpeakable priviledge of Adoption,
and ſo fills our ſoules with joy unſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kable
and glorious; A man would
thinke, this was the <hi>ſecureſt condition</hi>
in the world: what ſoule does not cry
with <hi>Peter</hi> in the mount; <hi>it is Good for
me to be here,</hi> to abide here for ever:
But yet very frequently, ſome <hi>bitter
temptation</hi> is now at hand. Satan ſees,
that being poſſeſt by the <hi>Joy</hi> before us,
we quickly <hi>neglect</hi> many wayes of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
to our ſoules, wherein he ſeeks,
and finds advantages againſt us. Is this
then our ſtate and condition? does God
at any time give us to drinke of the <hi>ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers</hi>
of pleaſure, that are at his right
hand, and ſatisfy our ſoules with his
<hi>kindneſſe</hi> as with marrow and fatneſſe?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="119" facs="tcp:115354:64"/>
Let us not ſay, we ſhall never be
moved; we know not how ſoone God
may <hi>hide his face,</hi> or a <hi>meſſenger</hi> from
Satan may buffet us.</p>
            <p>Beſides, there lyes oftentimes a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and worſe deceit in this buſineſſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
men cheat their <hi>ſoules</hi> with their own
<hi>fancies,</hi> in ſtead of a ſenſe of Gods love
by the Holy Ghoſt; and when they are
lifted up, with their imaginations,
it is not expreſſible how <hi>fearfully</hi> they
are expoſed to all manner of Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;
and how they are able to find
reliefe againſt their conſciences, from
their own fooliſh fancies, and decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings
wherewith they <hi>ſport</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves:
may we not ſee ſuch every day?

<pb n="120" facs="tcp:115354:65"/>
is at hand. The caſe of <hi>Peter</hi> is cleare
unto this: <hi>I will not deny thee; though
all men ſhould deny thee, I will not:</hi>
though I vvere to dye for it, I vvould
not doe it. This ſaid the <hi>poore man,</hi>
vvhen he ſtood on the very <hi>brinke</hi> of
that temptation, that coſt him in the
iſſue, ſuch <hi>bitter teares.</hi> And this taught
him ſo far to knovv <hi>himſelfe</hi> all his
dayes, and gave him ſuch acquaintance
with the ſtate of all Believers, that
when he had <hi>received more</hi> of the ſpirit
and of power, yet he had <hi>leſſe</hi> of confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
and ſaw it was fit that others
ſhould have ſo alſo; And therefore
perſwades all men to <hi>paſſe the time of
their ſojurning here in feare,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.
17. Not to be confident and high, as
he was, leſt, as he did, they <hi>fall.</hi> At the
firſt triall he compares himſelfe with
others, &amp; vaunts himſelfe above them;
<hi>though all men ſhould forſake thee, yet I
will not;</hi> he feares every man more than
himſelfe: But when our Saviour after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
comes to him &amp; puts him directly
upon the compariſon, <hi>Simon Peter lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:115354:65"/>
thou me, more than theſe,</hi> Joh. 21.
15. he hath done comparing himſelfe
with others, and only cryeth <hi>Lord thou
knoweſt that I love thee:</hi> He will lift up
himſelfe above others no more. Such
a ſeaſon oftentimes falls out. Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations
are abroad in the world, <hi>falſe
doctrines,</hi> with innumerable other al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lurements
&amp; provocations; we are rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
every one to be very confident, that
<hi>we</hi> ſhall not be ſurprized with them:
though <hi>all men ſhould fall into</hi> theſe
follies, yet <hi>we would not:</hi> ſurely we
ſhall never goe off from our walking
with God; it is impoſſible our hearts
ſhould be ſo ſottiſh: But ſayes the
Apoſtle, <hi>be not high minded but
feare;</hi> let <hi>him that ſtandeth take
heed leſt he fall.</hi> Wouldeſt thou thinke
that <hi>Peter,</hi> who had walked on the <hi>ſea</hi>
with Chriſt, confeſſed him to be <hi>the
Sonne of God,</hi> been with him on the
<hi>mount</hi> when he heard the voice from
<hi>the excellent Glory,</hi> ſhould at the word
of a <hi>ſervant girle,</hi> when there was no
<hi>legall</hi> inquiſition after him, no proceſſe
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:115354:66"/>
againſt him, nor any one in his condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
inſtantly fall a <hi>curſing</hi> and <hi>ſweare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
that he <hi>knew</hi> him not, let them
take heed of ſelfe-confidence who have
any mind to take heed of ſinne. And
this is the firſt thing in our watching,
to conſider well the ſeaſons wherein
temptation uſually makes its approa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
to the ſoule, and be armed againſt
them. And theſe are ſome of the
ſeaſons, wherein Temptations are nigh
at hand.</p>

now to that which reſpects the <hi>heart</hi>
its ſelfe, which is wrought upon, and
entangled by Temptation: watching
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:115354:67"/>
or keeping of the heart, which <hi>above
all keepings</hi> we are obliged unto,
comes within the compaſſe of this
duty alſo; for the right performance
whereof, take theſe enſuing directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
            <p>1. Let him that would not <hi>enter</hi>
into Temptation labour to know his
owne heart, to be acquainted with his
owne ſpirit, his naturall frame, and
temper, his <hi>Luſts</hi> and <hi>Corruptions,</hi> his
naturall, ſinfull, or ſpirituall weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes,
that finding where his weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
lyes, he may be carefull to keep
at a diſtance from all occaſions of
ſinne. Our Saviour tells the <hi>diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
that they knew not what Spirit
they were of,</hi> which under a pretence
of <hi>zeale</hi> betraid them into ambition
and deſire of Revenge. Had they
<hi>knowne it,</hi> they would have <hi>watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi>
over themſelves. <hi>David</hi> tells us,
Pſal. 18. 23. that he <hi>conſidered his
waies,</hi> and kept himſelfe <hi>from his ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity,</hi>
which he was particularly prone
unto.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="125" facs="tcp:115354:67"/>
There are Advantages for tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
lying oftentimes in mens <hi>natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
tempers</hi> and conſtitution: ſome
are <hi>naturally gentle, facile,</hi> eaſy to be
intreated, pliable, which though it
be the <hi>nobleſt</hi> temper of nature, and
the beſt and choyſeſt ground when
well broken up and <hi>fallowed</hi> for grace
to grow in, yet if not <hi>watched</hi> over,
will be a meanes of innumerable ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizalls,
and entanglements in Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.
Others are <hi>earthy, froward,
moroſe;</hi> ſo that envy, malice, ſelfiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
peeviſhneſſe, harſh thoughts of
others, repinings, lye at the very
doore of their natures, and they can
ſcarce ſtep out, but they are in the
ſnare of one or other of them: Others
are <hi>paſſionate</hi> and the like. Now he
that would watch, that he enter not
into temptation, had need be acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with his owne <hi>naturall</hi> temper:
that he may watch over the treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
that lye in it continually; Take
heed leſt you have a <hi>Jehu</hi> in you, that
ſhall make you <hi>drive</hi> furiouſly, or a
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:115354:68"/>
               <hi>Jonah</hi> in you, that will make you rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to repine; or a <hi>David,</hi> that will
make you haſty in your determinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
as he was often in the warmth and
goodneſſe of his naturall temper. He
who <hi>watches</hi> not this throughly, who
is not exactly kill'd in the knowledge
of himſelfe, will never be diſintangled
from one Temptation or another, all
his daies.</p>
            <p>Againe! as men have peculiar <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
tempers,</hi> which according as they
are <hi>attended</hi> or mannaged, prove a
great <hi>Fomes</hi> of ſinne, or advantage to
the exerciſe of Grace; ſo men may
have <hi>peculiar luſts</hi> or corruptions,
which either by their <hi>naturall conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution</hi>
or education and other prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
have got deep rooting and
ſtrength in them. This alſo is to be
found out by him, who would not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
into temptation. Unleſſe, he know
it, unleſſe his eye be alwaies on it, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
he obſerve its actings, motions,
advantages, it will continually be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangling
and inſnaring of him. This
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:115354:68"/>
then is our fixt direction in this kind;
labour to know <hi>thine owne frame</hi> and
temper, what ſpirit thou art of; what
<hi>aſſociates</hi> in thy heart <hi>Satan</hi> hath,
where Corruption is ſtrong, where
Grace is weak; what ſtrong hold luſt
hath in thy naturall conſtitution and
the like. How many have all their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts
blaſted, and peace diſturbed, by
their <hi>naturall paſſion</hi> and peeviſhneſſe?
How many are <hi>rendred uſeleſſe</hi> in the
world, by their <hi>frowardneſſe</hi> and diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent?
how many are diſquieted even
by their owne gentleneſſe and ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty?
be acquainted then with thine
owne heart, though it be <hi>deepe,</hi> ſearch
it: though it be <hi>dark,</hi> enquire into it:
though it give all its <hi>diſtempers</hi> other
names then what are their due believe
it not. Were not men utter ſtrangers
to themſelves, did they not give <hi>flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering</hi>
titles to their naturall diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers,
did they not ſtrive rather to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtify
palliate or excuſe the evills of
their hearts, that are ſuited to their
naturall tempers and conſtitutions,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:115354:69"/>
then to deſtroy them, and by theſe
meanes keep themſelves off from ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
a cleare and diſtinct view of them;
it were impoſſible that they ſhould all
their daies hang in the ſame <hi>briers</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
attempt for deliverance; <hi>uſeleſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe</hi>
and <hi>ſcandall</hi> in profeſſors, are
branches growing conſtantly on this
root of unacquaintedneſſe with their
owne frame and temper; and how
few are there, who will either ſtudy
them themſelves; or <hi>beare</hi> with thoſe
who would acquaint them with
them.</p>
            <p>2. When thou knoweſt the <hi>ſtate</hi>
and condition of thy heart as to the
particulars mentioned, <hi>watch</hi> againſt
all ſuch Occaſions, Opportunities,
Employments, ſocieties, retirements,
buſineſſes, as are apt to intangle thy
<hi>naturall temper,</hi> or provoke thy <hi>cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption.</hi>
It may be there are ſome
<hi>waies,</hi> ſome <hi>ſocieties,</hi> ſome <hi>buſineſſes,</hi>
that thou never in thy life eſcaped'ſt
them, but ſuffered'ſt by them, more
or leſſe through their <hi>ſutableneſſe</hi> to
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:115354:69"/>
tice, or provoke thy Corruption. It
may be, thou art in a ſtate and condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of life, that <hi>inſnares</hi> thee day
by day, on the account of thy ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
paſſion, diſcontent or the like;
if thou haſt any love to thy ſoule, it
is time for thee to awake, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver
thy ſelfe as a bird from the evill
ſnare. <hi>Peter</hi> will not come againe in
haſt to the <hi>High-prieſts</hi> hall, nor would
<hi>David</hi> walke againe in the <hi>top</hi> of his
houſe, when he ſhould have been in
the <hi>high places</hi> of the field. But the
particulars of this inſtance are ſo va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious,
and of ſuch ſeverall natures in
reſpect of ſeverall perſons, that it is
impoſſible to enumerate them, <hi>Prov.
4.</hi> 14, 15. Herein lyes no ſmall part of
that <hi>Wiſdome,</hi> which conſiſts in our
ordering our <hi>Converſation</hi> aright. See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
we have ſo litle power over our
hearts, when once they meet with ſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
<hi>provocations,</hi> we are to keep
them aſunder, as a man would do fire
and the <hi>combuſtible</hi> parts of the houſe
wherein he dwells.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="130" facs="tcp:115354:70"/>
3. Be ſure to lay in <hi>proviſion</hi> in
ſtore, againſt the approaching of any
Temptation. This alſo belongs to
our <hi>watchfulneſſe</hi> over our hearts. You
will ſay, what <hi>proviſion</hi> is intended,
and <hi>where</hi> is it to be laid up? Our
<hi>hearts,</hi> (as our Saviour <hi>ſpeaks</hi> are
our Treaſury. There we lay up what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
we have, <hi>Good</hi> or bad; and thence
do we draw it, for our uſe, <hi>Matth. 12.
35.</hi> It is the heart then wherein <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion</hi>
is to be laid up againſt Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.
When an Enemy drawes nigh
to a fort, or Caſtle to beſeige and take
it; oftentimes if he find it well <hi>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,</hi>
and furniſhed with proviſion for
a <hi>ſeige,</hi> and ſo able to hold out, he
withdrawes and aſſaults it not. If <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan</hi>
the Prince of this world <hi>come,</hi> and
find our hearts <hi>fortified</hi> againſt his <hi>bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries,</hi>
and <hi>provided</hi> to hold out, he
not only <hi>departs,</hi> but as <hi>James</hi> ſaies,
he <hi>flyes;</hi> he <hi>will fly from us,</hi> Jam. 4. 7.
for the <hi>proviſion</hi> to be laid up, it is
that which is provided in the Goſpell
for us, Goſpell proviſions will do
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:115354:70"/>
this work; that is, <hi>keep the heart full
of a ſenſe of the love of God in Chriſt:</hi>
this is the greateſt preſervative againſt
the power of temptation in the world.
<hi>Joſeph</hi> had this; and therefore on the
firſt appearance of a temptation, he
cries out; <hi>how can I do this great evill,
and ſinne againſt God?</hi> and there is an
end of the temptation, as to him, it
layes no hold on him, but departs.
He was furniſhed with ſuch a <hi>ready
ſenſe</hi> of the love of God; as Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
could not ſtand before, <hi>Gen. 39. 9.
The love of Chriſt conſtraines us,</hi> ſaith
the Apoſtle, <hi>to live to him,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.
14. and ſo conſequently, to withſtand
Temptation. A man <hi>may,</hi> nay he
<hi>ought</hi> to lay in proviſions of the <hi>Law</hi>
alſo; feare of <hi>death, hell</hi> puniſhment,
with the terror of the Lord in them.
But theſe are farre more eaſily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered
then the other: Nay they will
never ſtand <hi>alone</hi> againſt a vigorous
aſſault. They are conquered in <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced</hi>
perſons every day: hearts ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
with them, will ſtruggle for a
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:115354:71"/>
while, but quickly give over: But
ſtore the heart with a ſenſe of the Love
of God in Chriſt; with the eternall
deſigne of his grace, with a <hi>taſt</hi> of the
blood of Chriſt, and his <hi>Love</hi> in the
ſhedding of it; get a reliſh of the <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges</hi>
we have thereby; our <hi>Adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
Juſtification, Acceptation</hi> with
God, fill the heart with thoughts of
the <hi>beauty</hi> of <hi>holineſſe</hi> as it is deſigned
by Chriſt for the End, Iſſue, and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
of his death, and thou wilt in an
<hi>ordinary courſe</hi> of walking with God,
have great peace and ſecurity as to the
<hi>diſturbance</hi> of temptations. When
men can live and <hi>plod</hi> on, in their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion,
and not be able to ſay, when
they had any <hi>living ſenſe of the Love
of God,</hi> or of the priviledges which we
have in the blood of Chriſt; I know
not what they can have to keep them
from falling into ſnares. The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
tells us, that the peace of God
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> Phi. 4. 7. ſhall keepe
our hearts; <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, is a <hi>military</hi> word a
garriſon: and ſo <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, is, ſhall keep
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:115354:71"/>
               <hi>as in a Garriſon:</hi> Now a <hi>Garriſon</hi> hath
two things attending it. 1. That it is
expoſed to the <hi>aſſaaults</hi> of its enemies.
2. That <hi>ſafety</hi> lies in it from their
attempts. It is ſo with our ſoules:
They are expoſed to Temptations,
aſſaulted continually: but if there be
a <hi>garriſon</hi> in them, or if they be kept
as in a garriſon, temptation ſhall not
<hi>enter,</hi> and conſequently <hi>we ſhall not
enter into temptation.</hi> Now how is
this done? ſaith he, the <hi>peace of God</hi>
ſhall do it: what is this peace of God?
a <hi>ſenſe of his love and favour</hi> in Jeſus
Chriſt. Let this <hi>abide</hi> in you, and it
ſhall <hi>garriſon</hi> you, againſt all aſſaults
whatever: Beſides, there is that in an
eſpeciall manner, which is alſo in all
the reſt of the <hi>directions;</hi> namely that
the thing its ſelfe lyes in a direct <hi>oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition</hi>
to all the waies and meanes
that Temptation can make uſe of to
approach unto our ſoules. Conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to obtaine, and keep, a <hi>ſenſe of
the love</hi> of God in Chriſt, in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of it, obviates all the workings
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:115354:72"/>
and inſinuations of Temptation. Let
this be a third direction then in our
<hi>watching</hi> againſt Temptation: Lay in
ſtore <hi>of Goſpell proviſions,</hi> that may
make the ſoule a <hi>defenced place,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
all the aſſaults thereof.</p>
            <p>4. In the firſt <hi>approach</hi> of any
Temptation, (as we are all tempted)
theſe directions following are alſo ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to carry on the work of watching
which we are in the purſuit of.</p>
            <p>1. Be alwaies awake, that thou
may'ſt have an <hi>early diſcovery</hi> of thy
Temptation; that thou may'ſt know it
ſo to be. Moſt men perceive not their
<hi>enemy,</hi> untill they are <hi>wounded</hi> by him.
Yea others may ſometimes ſee them
deeply ingaged, whileſt themselves are
utterly inſenſible; They ſleepe without
any ſenſe of danger, untill others come
and awake them, by telling them that
their <hi>houſe</hi> is on <hi>fire.</hi> Temptation in
a <hi>neuter</hi> ſenſe is not eaſily diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able:
namely as it denotes, ſuch a <hi>way,</hi>
or thing, or matter, as is, or may be
made uſe of, for the ends of Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:115354:72"/>
few take notice of it, untill it is
too late; and they find themſelves <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled,</hi>
if not wounded. Watch then
to underſtand <hi>betimes,</hi> the ſnares that
are laid for thee; to underſtand the <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages</hi>
thy enemies have againſt
thee, before they get ſtrength &amp; pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er;
before they are incorporated with
thy luſts, and have diſtilled poyſon
into thy ſoule.</p>
            <p>2. Conſider the <hi>ayme</hi> and tenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of the Temptation, whatever it be,
and of all that are concerned in it.
Thoſe who have an <hi>active</hi> concurrence
into thy Temptation, are <hi>Satan,</hi> and
thy owne <hi>luſts.</hi> For thine owne <hi>luſt</hi>
I have manifeſted <hi>elſewhere</hi> what it
aimes at in all its actings and enticings.
It never <hi>riſes</hi> up, but its intendment
is the <hi>worſt</hi> of evills. Every acting of
it, would be a formed <hi>Enmity</hi> againſt
God. Hence look upon it, in its firſt
attempts, what pretences ſoever may
be made, as thy <hi>mortall</hi> enemy; <hi>I hate
it,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 15. that
is the working of Luſt in me, I <hi>hate</hi>
               <pb n="136" facs="tcp:115354:73"/>
it; it is the <hi>greateſt enemy</hi> I have. Oh
that it were killed and deſtroyed: Oh
that I were delivered out of the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of it. Know then that in the firſt
attempt or aſſault in any temptation,
thy moſt <hi>curſed ſworne enemy</hi> is at
hand, is ſetting on thee, and that for
thy utter ruine; ſo that it were the
greateſt madneſſe in the world, to
throw thy ſelfe into his armes, to be
deſtroyed. But of this I have ſpoken
in my diſcourſe of <hi>Mortification.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hath <hi>Satan</hi> any more friendly aime
and intention towards thee, who is a
ſharer in every Temptation? To <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guile</hi>
thee as a <hi>ſerpent,</hi> to <hi>devoure</hi> thee
as a <hi>Lyon,</hi> is the friendſhip that he
owes thee. I ſhall only adde that the
ſinne he tempts thee to againſt the
Law, is not the thing he aymes at; his
deſigne lies againſt thy intereſt in the
Goſpell. He would make ſin, but a
<hi>bridg</hi> to get over to a better ground to
aſſault thee, <hi>as</hi> to thy intereſt in Chriſt.
He who perhaps will ſay to <hi>day</hi> thou
mayſt venture on ſinne, becauſe thou
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:115354:73"/>
haſt an intereſt in Chriſt; will to <hi>mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row</hi>
tell thee to the purpoſe, that thou
haſt none, becauſe thou haſt done ſo.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Meet</hi> thy temptation in its en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance
with thoughts of <hi>faith</hi> concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<hi>Chriſt on the Croſſe:</hi> This will
make it <hi>ſinke</hi> before thee. Entertaine
no <hi>parly,</hi> no diſpute with it, if thou
wouldeſt not enter into it. Say it is
<hi>Chriſt that dyed,</hi> that dyed for ſuch ſins
as theſe. This is called taking the
<hi>ſheild of Faith to quench the fiery darts
of Satan,</hi> Ep. 6. 16. Faith doth it, by
laying <hi>hold</hi> on Chriſt crucified, his
<hi>Love</hi> therein, and what from thence
he ſuffered for ſinne. Let thy tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation
be what it will; be it <hi>unto</hi> ſin,
to feare or doubting <hi>for</hi> ſinne, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
thy ſtate and condition, its not
able to ſtand before faith lifting up the
<hi>ſtandard</hi> of the Croſſe. We know
what meanes the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> who have loſt
the power of faith, uſe to keep up the
forme. They will <hi>ſigne themſelves
with the ſigne of the croſſe;</hi> or make <hi>ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall</hi>
Croſſes, and by virtue of that
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:115354:74"/>
worke done think to <hi>ſcare</hi> away the
Devill. To act faith on Chriſt cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
is really to <hi>ſigne our ſelves with
the ſigne of the Croſſe;</hi> and thereby ſhall
we overcome that wicked one, 1 <hi>Pe.</hi> 5. 9</p>
            <p>4. Suppoſe the ſoule hath been
<hi>ſurprized</hi> by temptation and intangled
at unavvares, ſo that novv it is too
late to reſiſt the firſt entrances of it;
vvhat ſhall ſuch a ſoule doe, that it be
not <hi>plunged</hi> into it, and carried avvay
vvith the povver thereof?</p>
            <p>1. Doe as <hi>Paul</hi> did; beſeech God
againe and againe, that it may <hi>depart
from thee,</hi> 2 Cor. 12. 7. and if
thou abideſt therein, thou ſhalt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely
either be <hi>ſpecedily</hi> deliverd out
of it, or receive a <hi>ſufficiency</hi> of Grace
not to be foyled utterly by it. Only!
as I ſaid in part before, do not ſo much
imploy thy thoughts about the <hi>things</hi>
vvhereunto thou art tempted, vvhich
oftentimes raiſeth further intangle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
but ſet thy ſelfe againſt the
<hi>Temptation</hi> it ſelfe. Pray againſt the
temptation that it may depart; and
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:115354:74"/>
vvhen that is taken avvay, the <hi>things</hi>

            <p>2: Fly to Chriſt, in a peculiar man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
as he <hi>was tempted;</hi> and beg of him
to give thee ſuccour in this <hi>needfull
time of trouble,</hi> Heb. 2. 18. the Apoſtle
inſtructs us herein: <hi>in that he hath been
tempted, he is able to ſuccour them that
are tempted:</hi> this is the meanining of it;
vvhen you are <hi>tempted,</hi> and are ready
to faint, vvhen you vvant <hi>ſuccour,</hi> you
muſt have it or you dye; act faith pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarly
on Chriſt, as he vvas tempted.
That is! conſider that he vvas <hi>tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted
himſelfe,</hi> that he ſuffered thereby,
that he <hi>conquered</hi> all temptations, and
that not <hi>merely</hi> on his ovvne account,
ſeeing for our ſakes he ſubmitted to be
tempted; but for us: (he conquered <hi>in,</hi>
and by himſelfe, but <hi>for</hi> us) and <hi>draw,</hi>
yea <hi>expect</hi> ſuccour from him, <hi>Heb. 4.
15,</hi> 16. lye dovvne at his feet, make
thy complaint knovvne to him, begge
his aſſiſtance, &amp; it vvill not be in vaine.</p>
            <p>3. Looke to him who hath <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:115354:75"/>
deliverance:</hi> Conſider that he
is <hi>faithfull,</hi> and will not ſuffer thee to
be tempted above what thou art able.
Conſider that he hath <hi>promiſed</hi> a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable
iſſue of theſe trialls and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations.
Call all the promiſes to mind,
of Aſſiſtance and deliverance that he
hath made: ponder them in thy heart,
and reſt upon it, that God hath innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable
wayes that thou knoweſt not
of, to give thee in deliverance: as,</p>
            <p>1 He can ſend an <hi>Affliction,</hi> that
ſhall <hi>mortifie</hi> thy heart unto the matter
of the Temptation, whatever it be:
That that which was before a <hi>ſweet
morſell</hi> under the tongue, ſhall neither
have taſt, or reliſh in it unto thee; thy
<hi>deſire</hi> to it ſhall be killed: as was the
caſe with <hi>David:</hi> or</p>
            <p>2. He can by <hi>ſome providence</hi> alter
that whole ſtate of things, from whence
thy temptation doth ariſe; ſo taking
<hi>fuell</hi> from <hi>the fire,</hi> cauſing it to goe
out of it ſelfe; as it was with the ſame
<hi>David</hi> in the day of <hi>Battell:</hi> or,</p>
            <p>3. He can <hi>tread down Satan under
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:115354:75"/>
thy feet,</hi> that he ſhall not dare to ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt
any thing any more to thy diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
(the God of peace ſhall doe
it;) that thou ſhalt heare of him no
more: or</p>
            <p>4. He can give thee ſuch <hi>ſupply</hi> of
Grace, as that thou mayeſt be <hi>freed,</hi>
though not from the <hi>temptation</hi> it
ſelfe, yet from the <hi>tendency</hi> and <hi>danger</hi>
of it, as was the caſe with <hi>Paul:</hi> or</p>
            <p>5. He can give thee ſuch a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable
perſwaſion of <hi>Good ſucceſſe</hi> in
the iſſue, as that thou ſhalt have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhment
in thy trialls, and be kept
from the trouble of the temptation:
As was the caſe with the ſame <hi>Paul:</hi>
or</p>
            <p>6. He can <hi>utterly</hi> remove it, and
make thee a compleat Conquerour:
And innumerable other wayes he hath,
of keeping thee from entring into
temptation, ſo as to be foyled by it.</p>
            <p>4. Conſider where the Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
wherevvith thou art ſurprized,
hath made its entrance, and by vvhat
meanes, and vvith all ſpeed make up
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:115354:76"/>
that breach: ſtop that paſſage vvhich
the <hi>waters</hi> have made to enter in at.</p>
            <p>Deale vvith thy ſoule like a <hi>wiſe
Phyſitian;</hi> inquire vvhen, hovv by
vvhat meanes thou felleſt into this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempet:
and if thou findeſt negligence,
<hi>Careleſſneſſe,</hi> vvant of keeping vvatch
over thy fleſh, to have lyen at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome
of it, fix thy ſoule there; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvaile
that before the Lord; make up
that <hi>breach,</hi> and then proceed to the

(ſaith he) <hi>thou haſt kept the word of my

And therefore, I ſhall firſt

            <p>The <hi>word</hi> of Chriſt, is the <hi>word</hi> of
the Goſpell; The <hi>word</hi> by him revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
from the boſome of the Father.
The word of the <hi>word;</hi> the word ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
in time by the <hi>eternall word.</hi> So
it is called, the <hi>word of Chriſt.</hi> Col. 3.
16. or the <hi>Goſpell of Chriſt.</hi> Rom. 1. 16.
1. Cor. 9. 12. And the <hi>doctrine of Chriſt.</hi>
Heb. 6. 1. of Chriſt, that is, as its Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour,
Heb. 1. 1, 2. and <hi>of him,</hi> as the
chiefe ſubject or matter of it, 1 Cor.
1. 20. Now this <hi>word,</hi> is called the
word of Chriſts <hi>patience,</hi> or tolerance,
and forbearance, upon the account of
that <hi>patience, and long ſuffering</hi> which
in the diſpenſation of it, the Lord
Chriſt exerciſeth towards the <hi>world,</hi>
and all perſons in it; and that both <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctively,</hi>
and <hi>paſsively;</hi> in his <hi>bearing</hi>
with men, and enduring from them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="145" facs="tcp:115354:77"/>
1. He is <hi>patient</hi> towards his Saints,
he <hi>beares</hi> with them, <hi>ſuffers</hi> from them.
He is <hi>patient to us-ward,</hi> 2. Pet. 3. 9,
that is, <hi>that believe.</hi> The Goſpell is
the word of Chriſts <hi>patience</hi> even to
<hi>Believers.</hi> A ſoule acquainted with
the Goſpell, knowes that there is no
<hi>Property</hi> of Chriſt rendred more glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
therein, than that of his <hi>patience;</hi>
That he ſhould beare with ſo <hi>many

ſo many <hi>neglects</hi> of his love,
ſo many <hi>affronts</hi> done to his Grace, ſo
many <hi>violations</hi> of ingagements, as he
doth; it manifeſts his Goſpell to be
not only the word of his <hi>Grace,</hi> but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
of his <hi>patience.</hi> He <hi>ſuffers</hi> alſo
<hi>from them,</hi> in all the <hi>reproaches,</hi> they

            <p>2. Towards his <hi>Elect,</hi> not yet effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually
called. <hi>Revel.</hi> 3. 20. He ſtands
<hi>waiting</hi> at the <hi>doore</hi> of their hearts, and
<hi>knocks</hi> for an entrance. He deales with
them by all meanes, and yet ſtands and
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:115354:78"/>
waits, untill, <hi>his head is filled with the
dew, and his lockes with the drops of
the night,</hi> Cant. 5. 2. as enduring the
cold and inconvenencies of the <hi>night,</hi>
that when his <hi>morning</hi> is come; he may
have entrance. Oftentimes for a long
ſeaſon, he is by them <hi>ſcorned</hi> in his
perſon, <hi>perſecuted</hi> in his Saints and
wayes, reviled in his word, whileſt he
ſtands at the <hi>doore,</hi> in the <hi>word of his
patience,</hi> with his heart full of love to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
their poore rebellious ſoules.</p>
            <p>3. To the periſhing world; Hence
the time of his <hi>Kingdome,</hi> in this
world is called the time of his patience.
<hi>Revel.</hi> 1. 9. he endures the <hi>veſſels</hi> of
wrath with much <hi>long ſuffering.</hi> Rom.
9. 22. Whileſt the Goſpell is admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred
in the vvorld, He is patient
tovvards the men thereof, untill the
Saints in heaven and earth are aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and cry out, <hi>how long?</hi> Pſal. 13. 1, 2.
Pſal. 35. 17. Revel. 6. 10; and them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
doe <hi>mocke</hi> at him as if he vvere
an Idol, 2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 4. He endures from

<pb n="147" facs="tcp:115354:78"/>
worſhip,</hi> ſaints, promiſes, threats, all
his <hi>intereſt</hi> of honour and love; and
yet paſſeth by them, lets them alone,
does them Good; nor will he cut this
way of proceeding ſhort, untill the
Goſpell ſhall be preached no more;
<hi>patience</hi> muſt accompany the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell.</p>
            <p>Now this is the <hi>Word</hi> that is to be
<hi>kept,</hi> that we may be <hi>kept</hi> from the

            <p>1. <hi>Knowledge,</hi> He that will <hi>keep</hi>
this <hi>Word</hi> muſt know it, be acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with it; under a foure fold No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</p>
            <p>1. As a word of <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Mercy</hi>
to ſave him.</p>
            <p>2. As a word of <hi>Holineſſe</hi> and <hi>Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi>
to ſancitfy him.</p>
            <p>3. As a word of <hi>Liberty</hi> and <hi>Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi>
to enoble him, and ſet him free.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="148" facs="tcp:115354:79"/>
4. As a word of <hi>Conſolation</hi> to
ſupport him in every Condition.</p>
            <p>1. As a word of <hi>Grace,</hi> and <hi>Mercy</hi>
able to ſave us: It is the <hi>power of
God unto ſalvation,</hi> Rom. 1. 16. The
Grace <hi>of God that bringeth ſalvation,
Titus,</hi> 2. 11. The word of Grace,
that is able to build us up, and to give
us an inheritance among all them that
are ſanctified, <hi>Act.</hi> 20. 32. The word
<hi>that is able to ſave our ſoules,</hi> Jam. 1.
21. When the word of the Goſpell is
<hi>knowne,</hi> as a word of <hi>mercy,</hi> Grace,
and pardon, as the ſole <hi>evidence</hi> for
life, as the <hi>conveyance</hi> of an eternall
inheritance; when the ſoule finds it
ſuch to it ſelfe, it will ſtrive to keep
it.</p>
            <p>2. As a word of <hi>Holineſſe</hi> and <hi>Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi>
able to ſanctify him; Ye are
<hi>cleane through the word I have ſpoken
unto you,</hi> ſaith our Saviour, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15. 3.
To that purpoſe is his prayer, <hi>Joh. 17.
17.</hi> He that knowes not the <hi>word</hi> of
Chriſts <hi>patience,</hi> as a <hi>ſanctifying</hi> clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
word, in the power of it, upon
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:115354:79"/>
his owne ſoule; neither knowes it, nor
<hi>keeps</hi> it. The empty profeſſion of
our daies, knowes not one <hi>ſtep</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
this duty; and thence it is, that
the moſt are ſo <hi>overborne</hi> under the
power of Temptations: men full of
<hi>ſelfe,</hi> of the world, of <hi>Fury,</hi> Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and almoſt all unclean luſts, do
yet talk of <hi>keeping</hi> the word of Chriſt,
See 1. <hi>Pet. 1. 22. 2. Tim.</hi> 2. 19.</p>
            <p>3. As a word of <hi>Liberty</hi> and <hi>Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,</hi>
to <hi>enoble</hi> him, and ſet him free;
and this, not only from the <hi>guilt</hi> of
ſinne and wrath, for that it doth, as
it is a word of <hi>Grace</hi> and mercy; nor
only from the <hi>power</hi> of ſinne, for that
it doth as it is a word of <hi>Holineſſe;</hi> but
alſo from all outward <hi>reſpects</hi> of men,
or the world, that might <hi>entangle</hi>
him, or enſlave him, that declares us
to be Chriſts <hi>freemen,</hi> and in <hi>bondage</hi>
unto none, <hi>Joh. 8. 32. 1. Cor.</hi> 7. 23.
we are not by it, freed from due <hi>ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection</hi>
unto <hi>ſuperiours,</hi> not from any
<hi>duty,</hi> not unto any ſinne, 1. <hi>Pet. 2.
16.</hi> but in two reſpects, it is a word
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:115354:80"/>
of <hi>freedome, liberty,</hi> largeneſſe of
mind, power, and deliverance from
<hi>Bondage.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. In reſpect of <hi>Conſcience,</hi> as to
the worſhip of God, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 1.</p>
            <p>2. In reſpect of <hi>ignoble</hi> ſlaviſh re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects,
unto the men, or things of
the world, in the Courſe of our pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimage;
The Goſpell gives a free,
large, and <hi>noble</hi> Spirit in ſubjection to
God, and none elſe; There is admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred
in it, a ſpirit <hi>not of feare, but
of power, and of love, and of a ſound
mind,</hi> 2 Tim. 1. 7. A mind in nothing
terrified, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 28. not ſwayed with
any by reſpect whatever; There is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more unworthy of the Goſpell,
then a mind in <hi>bondage</hi> to perſons, or
things proſtituting its ſelfe to the
luſts of men, or <hi>affrightments</hi> of the
world. And he that thus knowes the
<hi>word of Chriſts patience,</hi> really and in
power, is even thereby freed from
<hi>innumerable,</hi> from <hi>unſpeakable</hi> Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations.</p>
            <p>4. As a word of <hi>Conſolation</hi> to
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:115354:80"/>
ſupport him in every condition; and
to be a full portion in the want of all,
that is a word attended with <hi>Joy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable</hi>
and full of Glory; it gives
ſupportment, reliefe, refreſhment,
ſatisfaction, peace, conſolation, joy,
boaſting, Glory, in every Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
whatever; Thus to know the word
of Chriſts <hi>patience,</hi> thus to know the
Goſpell, is the <hi>firſt</hi> part, and it is a
<hi>great</hi> part of this condition of our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation
from the houre, and power
of Temptation.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Valuation</hi> of what is thus
knowne, belongs to the keeping of
this word, that is to be <hi>kept</hi> as a <hi>Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,</hi>
2 Tim. 1. 14. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
that excellent <hi>depoſitum</hi> (that is the
word of the Goſpell) <hi>keep it,</hi> (ſaith
the Apoſtle) <hi>by the Holy Ghoſt;</hi> And,
<hi>hold faſt the faithfull word,</hi> Tit. 1. 9.
It is a <hi>Good Treaſure,</hi> a faithfull word,
hold it faſt. It is a word that comprizes
the whole <hi>intereſt</hi> of Chriſt in the
world. To <hi>value</hi> that as our chiefeſt
treaſure, is to keep the word of
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:115354:81"/>
Chriſts patience. They that will have
a <hi>regard</hi> from Chriſt in the time of
Temptation, are not to be <hi>regardleſſe,</hi>
of his Concernments.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Obedience,</hi> perſonall <hi>Obedience,</hi>
in the Univerſall obſervation of all the
commands of Chriſt, is the <hi>keeping</hi>
of his Word, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14. 15. Cloſe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herence
unto Chriſt, in <hi>Holineſſe,</hi> and
univerſall <hi>Obedience,</hi> then when the
oppoſition, that the Goſpell of Chriſt
doth meet withall in the world, doth
render it ſignally the <hi>word of his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience,</hi>
is the life and ſoule of the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
required.</p>
            <p>Now all theſe are to be <hi>ſo managed,</hi>
with that intention of mind and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
that care of heart, and diligence
of the whole perſon, as to make up a
<hi>keeping</hi> of this word; which evidently
includes all thoſe Conſiderations.</p>
            <p>We are arrived then to the ſumme
of this <hi>ſafeguarding</hi> Duty; of this
<hi>Condition</hi> of freedome from the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of Temptation; He that having a
due acquaintance with the Goſpell, in
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:115354:81"/>
its <hi>Excellencies,</hi> as to him, a word
of <hi>Mercy, Holineſſe, Liberty</hi> and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation,</hi>
values it, in all its <hi>Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi>
as his choiſeſt and only Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure;
makes it his <hi>buſineſſe,</hi> and the
work of his life, to give himſelfe up
unto it in <hi>univerſall obedience,</hi> then
eſpecially, when <hi>Oppoſition,</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtacy</hi>
put the patience of Chriſt to
the utmoſt, he ſhall be preſerved from
the <hi>houre</hi> of <hi>Temptation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is that which is <hi>comprehenſive</hi>
of all that went before; and is <hi>exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive</hi>
of all other waies for the obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the End propoſed; nor let any
man think without this, to be kept
one houre from entring into Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation;
where ever he <hi>failes</hi> there
<hi>Temptation</hi> enters. That this will be
a ſure <hi>preſervative</hi> may appeare, from
the enſuing Conſiderations.</p>
            <p>1. It hath the <hi>Promiſe</hi> of Preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
and this alone hath ſo. It is
ſolemnly promiſed in the place men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
to the Church of <hi>Philadelphia</hi>
on this account. When a great triall
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:115354:82"/>
and Temptation was to come on the
<hi>world,</hi> at the opening of the <hi>ſeventh</hi>
ſeale, <hi>Rev.</hi> 7. 3. a caution is given for
the preſervation of Gods <hi>ſealed ones,</hi>
which are deſcribed to be thoſe, who
keep the <hi>word of Chriſt:</hi> for the <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe</hi>
is, that it ſhould be ſo. Now in
every <hi>promiſe</hi> there are three things to
be conſidered.</p>
            <p>1. The <hi>faithfulneſſe</hi> of the <hi>Father</hi>
who gives it.</p>
            <p>2. The <hi>Grace</hi> of the <hi>Son</hi> which is
the matter of it.</p>
            <p>3. The <hi>power</hi> and <hi>efficacy</hi> of the
<hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> which puts the promiſe in
Execution. And all theſe are ingaged
for the preſervation of ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
from the <hi>houre</hi> of Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p>1. The <hi>faithfulneſſe</hi> of God, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companyeth
the promiſe. On this
account is our deliverance laid, 1 <hi>Cor.
10.</hi> 13. Though we be tempted, yet
we ſhall be kept from the <hi>houre</hi> of
Temptation; it ſhall not grow too
ſtrong for us. What comes <hi>on</hi> us,
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:115354:82"/>
we ſhall be able to beare; and what
would be too <hi>hard</hi> for us, we ſhall eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape.
But what <hi>ſecurity</hi> have we
hereof? even the <hi>faithfulneſſe</hi> of God;
God <hi>is faithfull who will not ſuffer you</hi>
&amp;c. And wherein is God's <hi>faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe</hi>
ſeen and exerciſed? He is <hi>faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
that promiſed,</hi> Heb. 10. 23. His
<hi>faithfulneſſe</hi> conſiſts in his diſcharge
of his promiſes. He abideth <hi>faithfull,</hi>
he cannot <hi>deny himſelfe,</hi> 2 Tim. 2. 13.
ſo that by being under the <hi>promiſe,</hi>
we have the faithfulneſſe of God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
for our preſervation.</p>
            <p>2. There is in every promiſe of
the Covenant the <hi>Grace of the Son;</hi>
that is the ſubject matter of all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes.
<hi>I will keep thee,</hi> how? by
my <hi>Grace</hi> with thee: ſo that what Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance
the <hi>Grace</hi> of Chriſt can give
to a ſoule that hath a right in this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe,
in the houre of Temptation, it
ſhall enjoy it. <hi>Pauls</hi> Temptation
grew very high; it was likely to have
come to its <hi>prevalent houre:</hi> He <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeches
the Lord,</hi> (that is the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:115354:83"/>
Chriſt) for help, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 8.
and receives that anſwer from him,
<hi>my Grace is ſufficient for thee;</hi> verſ. 9:
That it was the Lord Chriſt and his
Grace, with whom he had peculiarly
to do, is evident from the cloſe of
that verſe; <hi>I will glory in my infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
that the power of Chriſt may reſt
upon me;</hi> or the efficacy of the Grace
of Chriſt in my preſervation, be made
evident, So <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 18.</p>
            <p>3. The <hi>Efficacy</hi> of the ſpirit, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companyeth
the promiſes. He is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
the <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> of <hi>promiſe;</hi> not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
becauſe he is promiſed by Chriſt,
but alſo, becauſe he <hi>effectually</hi> makes
Good the promiſe, and gives it ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment
in our ſoules. He alſo
then is ingaged to preſerve the ſoule
<hi>walking</hi> according to the rule laid
downe: See <hi>Iſai.</hi> 59. the <hi>laſt.</hi> Thus
where the <hi>promiſe</hi> is, there is all this
aſſiſtance; the <hi>faithfulneſſe</hi> of the <hi>fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi>
the <hi>Grace</hi> of the <hi>Son,</hi> the <hi>power</hi>
of the <hi>Spirit;</hi> all are ingaged in our
preſervation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="157" facs="tcp:115354:83"/>
2. This <hi>conſtant univerſall</hi> keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Chriſts <hi>word of Patience,</hi> will
keep the <hi>heart</hi> and <hi>ſoule</hi> in ſuch a <hi>frame</hi>
as wherein no prevalent Temptation,
by virtue of any advantages whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
can <hi>ſeize</hi> upon it, ſo as totally to
prevaile againſt it. So <hi>David</hi> prayes,
Pſ. 25. 21. <hi>Let integrity preſerve me.</hi>
This integrity and uprightneſſe, is the
<hi>old-Teſtament-keeping</hi> the word of
Chriſt, univerſall cloſe walking with
God. Now how can they preſerve a
man? why by keeping his heart in ſuch
a frame, ſo defended on every ſide, that
no evill can approach or take hold on
him. Faile a man in his <hi>integrity,</hi> he
hath an open place for temptation to
enter, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 57. 21. To keep the word
of Chriſt, is to do it <hi>univerſally,</hi> as
hath been ſhewed; This exerciſes
<hi>Grace</hi> in all the faculties of the ſoule;
&amp; <hi>compaſſes</hi> it with the whole armour
of God: The underſtanding is full of
<hi>light,</hi> the Affections of Love and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe;
let the <hi>Wind</hi> blow from what
quarter it will, the ſoule is <hi>fenced</hi> and
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:115354:84"/>
fortified; Let the enemy aſſault <hi>when,</hi>
or by what meanes he <hi>pleaſeth,</hi> all
things in the ſoule of ſuch an one are
upon the <hi>guard: How can I do this
thing and ſinne againſt God,</hi> is at hand,
Eſpecially, upon a <hi>twofold</hi> account,
doth deliverance and ſecurity ariſe
from this hand.</p>
            <p>1. By the <hi>Mortification</hi> of the
heart unto the <hi>matter</hi> of Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
The prevalency of any Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
ariſes from hence; that the <hi>heart</hi>
is ready to cloſe with the <hi>matter</hi> of it.
There are Luſts <hi>within,</hi> ſuited to the
propoſalls of the world or Satan
<hi>without.</hi> Hence <hi>James</hi> reſolves all
Temptations into our <hi>owne luſts.</hi> Ch.
1. 14. becauſe either they proceed
from, or are made effectuall by them
as hath been declared. Why doth
<hi>terror,</hi> or threates turne us aſide, from
a due conſtancy in the performance of
our duty? is it not becauſe there is
<hi>unmortified</hi> carnall feare abiding in us,
that <hi>tumultuates</hi> in ſuch a ſeaſon? why
is it that the Allurements of the world,
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:115354:84"/>
and compliances with men entangle
us? is it not becauſe our affections are
entangled with the <hi>things</hi> and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations
propoſed unto us? Now
keeping the <hi>word of Chriſts patience,</hi>
in the manner declared, keeps the
heart <hi>mortified</hi> to theſe things, and
ſo it is not eaſily entangled by them.
Saith the Apoſtle, <hi>Gal. 2. 20. I am
crucified with Chriſt,</hi> he that keeps
cloſe to Chriſt, is <hi>crucified</hi> with him;
and is <hi>dead</hi> to all the deſires of the
fleſh and the world: as more fully;
Chap. 6. 14. Here the <hi>match</hi> is bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
and all love, entangling love
diſſolved.</p>
            <p>1. The heart is <hi>crucified</hi> to the
world, and all things in it. Now the
<hi>matter</hi> of all temptations almoſt is
taken out of the world; the men of it,
or the things of it make them up.
As to theſe things ſaies the Apoſtle
<hi>I am crucified to them:</hi> (And it is ſo with
every one, that <hi>keeps the word of
Chriſt,</hi> my heart is <hi>mortified</hi> unto
them; I have no <hi>deſire</hi> after them; nor
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:115354:85"/>
               <hi>affection</hi> to them, nor <hi>delight</hi> in them:
and they are <hi>crucified</hi> unto me. The
Crownes, Glories, <hi>Thrones,</hi> pleaſures,
profits, of the world, I ſee nothing
<hi>deſirable</hi> in them; the luſts, ſenſuall
pleaſures, Love, reſpects, honours
of men, <hi>name</hi> and reputation among
them, they are all as a thing of nought;
I have no <hi>value,</hi> nor eſtimation of
them. This ſoule is <hi>ſafeguarded</hi> from
aſſaults of manifold Temptations.
When <hi>Achan</hi> ſaw the Goodly <hi>Babi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loniſh</hi>
garment, and <hi>two hundred ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kells
of ſilver,</hi> and a <hi>wedge of Gold;</hi> firſt
he <hi>coveted</hi> them, then he <hi>took</hi> them,
<hi>Joh.</hi> 7. 21. Temptation ſubtilly
ſpreads the <hi>Babiloniſh</hi> garment of <hi>fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,
praiſe,</hi> peace, the ſilver of
pleaſure, or profit, with the golden
<hi>Contentmens</hi> of the fleſh, before the
eyes of men; if now there be that in
them alive, <hi>unmortified,</hi> that will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
fall a <hi>coveting,</hi> let what feare
of puniſhment will enſue, the <hi>heart</hi> or
hand, will be put forth unto iniquity.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="161" facs="tcp:115354:85"/>
Herein then lyes the ſecurity of
ſuch a <hi>frame,</hi> as that deſcribed; it is
alwaies accompanied with a mortified
heart; <hi>crucified</hi> unto the things that
are the <hi>matter</hi> of our Temptations;
without which it is utterly impoſſible,
that we ſhould be preſerved one <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
when any temptation doth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall
us. If liking, and love of the
things propoſed, inſinuated, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
in the temptation, be living
and active in us, we ſhall not be able
to <hi>reſiſt and ſtand.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. In this <hi>frame</hi> the heart is filled
with <hi>better</hi> things, and their Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency;
ſo farre as to be fortified againſt
the <hi>matter</hi> of any Temptation. See
what Reſolution this puts <hi>Paul</hi> upon:
<hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 8. All is loſſe and dung to
him. Who would go out of his way,
to have his armes full of <hi>loſſe</hi> and <hi>dung?</hi>
and whence is it, that he hath this eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
of the moſt deſirable things
in the world? it is from that deare eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
he had of the Excellency of
Chriſt; ſo <hi>verſ.</hi> 10. When the ſoule
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:115354:86"/>
is exerciſed to <hi>Communion</hi> with Chriſt,
and to <hi>walking</hi> with him: he drinks
<hi>new</hi> wine, and cannot deſire the <hi>old</hi>
things of the world, for he ſaies the new
is better. He taſts every day how
<hi>gracious</hi> the Lord is, and therefore
longs not after the ſweetneſſe of <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden</hi>
things, which indeed have none.
He that makes it his buſineſſe to <hi>eate</hi>
daily of the <hi>tree of life,</hi> will have no
appetite unto other fruit, though the
<hi>Tree</hi> that bare them ſeeme to ſtand in
the middeſt of Paradiſe. This the
ſpouſe makes the meanes of her pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation;
even the Excellency which
by daily Communion, ſhee found in
Chriſt and his Graces, above all other
deſirable things. Let a ſoule exerciſe
it ſelfe to Communion with Chriſt,
in the good things of the Goſpell,
<hi>pardon</hi> of ſinne, <hi>fruits</hi> of holineſſe,
<hi>hope</hi> of Glory, <hi>peace</hi> with God, <hi>joy</hi>
in the Holy Ghoſt, dominion over
ſinne, and he ſhall have a mighty pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervative
againſt all Temptations. As
the <hi>full ſoule</hi> loatheth the honey comb;
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:115354:86"/>
a ſoule filled with <hi>carnall,</hi> earthly, ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuall
contentments finds no relliſh nor
ſavour in the ſweeteſt ſpirituall things;
ſo he that is <hi>ſatisfied</hi> with the kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of God, as with <hi>marrow</hi> and fat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
that is every day entertained at
the <hi>banquet of wine,</hi> wine upon the
lees, and well refined, hath an holy
contempt of the baits and allurements
that lye in prevailing temptations, and
is ſafe.</p>
            <p>3. He that ſo <hi>keeps</hi> the word of
Chriſts patience, is alwaies furniſhed
with <hi>preſerving Conſiderations</hi> and
<hi>preſerving Principles: morall</hi> and <hi>reall</hi>
advantages of preſervation.</p>
            <p>1. He is furniſhed with preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<hi>Conſiderations,</hi> that powerfully in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
his ſoule in his walking dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently
with Chriſt: Beſides the ſenſe
of duty which is alwaies upon him, he
conſiders,</p>
            <p>1. The <hi>concernment</hi> of Chriſt,
whom his ſoule loves in him and his
carefull walking. He conſiders that
the <hi>preſence</hi> of Chriſt is with him, his
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:115354:87"/>
               <hi>eye</hi> upon him, that he ponders his
<hi>heart</hi> and waies, as one greatly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
in his deportment of himſelfe,
in a time of triall. So Chriſt mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſts
himſelfe to do, <hi>Revel. 2. 19,
20.</hi> I <hi>conſider all;</hi> what is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable,
what to be rejected:
He knowes that Chriſt is concerned
in his <hi>honour,</hi> that his <hi>name</hi> be not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill
ſpoken of by reaſon of him; that
he is concerned in <hi>love</hi> to his ſoule;
having that deſigne upon him to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
him <hi>holy</hi> and <hi>unblameable</hi> and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reproveable
in his ſight, <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 22.
and his ſpirit is grieved where he is
interrupted in this work; concerned
on the account of his <hi>Goſpell,</hi> the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſe
and acceptation of it in the
world; its <hi>beauty</hi> would be ſlurred,
its <hi>good things</hi> reviled, its progreſſe
ſtopped, if ſuch <hi>an one</hi> be prevailed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt;
concerned in his <hi>love</hi> to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
who are <hi>grieveouſly ſcandalized,</hi>
and perhaps ruined by the miſcarriages
of ſuch. When <hi>Hymeneus</hi> and <hi>Phile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi>
fall, they overthrow the <hi>faith of
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:115354:87"/>
ſome,</hi> and ſaies ſuch a ſoule then, who
is exerciſed to keep the <hi>word of Chriſts
patience,</hi> when intricate, perplexed,
intangling temptations, <hi>publique, pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate,
perſonall,</hi> do ariſe? ſhall I now
be <hi>careleſſe,</hi> ſhall I be <hi>negligent,</hi> ſhall I
comply with the <hi>world,</hi> &amp; the wayes of
it? oh what thoughts of heart hath he
concerning me, whoſe <hi>eye</hi> is upon me?
ſhall I contemne his <hi>honour,</hi> deſpiſe his
<hi>love,</hi> trample his <hi>Goſpell</hi> in the mire
under the feet of men, turne aſide <hi>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi>
from his ways? ſhall ſuch a man
as I fly, give over reſiſting? it cannot
be. There is no man who keeps the
word of the patience of Chriſt, but is
<hi>full</hi> of this ſoul preſſing conſideration;
it <hi>dwells</hi> on his heart and ſpirit, and
the love of Chriſt conſtraines him ſo
to keep his heart and waies, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi>
5. 10.</p>
            <p>2. The great <hi>conſideration</hi> of the
<hi>Temptations</hi> of Chriſt in his behalfe,
and the conqueſt he made in all aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaults
for his ſake, and his Good, dwell
alſo on his ſpirit. The <hi>Prince of this
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:115354:88"/>
world</hi> came <hi>upon</hi> him, the <hi>Glory</hi> of this
world was ſhewed <hi>unto</hi> him, every
thing in <hi>earth</hi> or <hi>hell,</hi> that hath either
<hi>allurement</hi> or <hi>affrightment</hi> in it, was
propoſed to him, to divert him from
the worke of mediation, which for us
he had undertaken: this whole <hi>life</hi> he
calls the time of his temptation: but
he <hi>reſiſted</hi> all, <hi>conquered</hi> all, and is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
a captaine of Salvation to them
that obey him. And, ſaies the Soule,
ſhall this Temptation, theſe arguings,
this plauſible pretence, this ſloth, this
ſelfe love, this ſenſuality, this baite of
the world, turne me aſide, prevaile over
me, to deſert him who went before me,
in the waies of all temptations that his
holy nature was obnoxious unto, for
my Good?</p>
            <p>3. Diſmall thoughts of the <hi>loſſe</hi> of
love, of the ſmiles of the countenance
of Chriſt, do alſo frequently <hi>exerciſe</hi>
ſuch a ſoul. He knowes what it is to
<hi>enjoy</hi> the favour of Chriſt, to have a
<hi>ſenſe</hi> of his Love, to be <hi>accepted</hi> in his
approaches to him, to converſe with
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:115354:88"/>
him; and perhaps hath been ſometimes
at ſome loſſe in this thing, and ſo
knowes alſo, what it is to be in the
<hi>dark,</hi> diſtanced from him. See the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment
of the ſpouſe in ſuch a caſe,
<hi>Cant.</hi> 3. 4. when ſhe had once found
him again; ſhe holds him, ſhe will
not let him go, ſhe will looſe him no
more.</p>
            <p>2 He that keeps the word of Chriſts
patience, hath <hi>preſerving principles,</hi>
whereby he is acted. Some of them
may be mentioned.</p>
            <p>1 Firſt, In all things he lives by
<hi>faith,</hi> and is acted by it in all his waies.
<hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 20. Now upon a twofold ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
hath faith, when improved, the
power of preſervation from Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<hi>annexed</hi> unto it.</p>
            <p>1 Becauſe it empties the ſoule of
its own <hi>wiſdome,</hi> underſtanding and
fulneſſe, that it may act in the wiſdome
and fulneſſe of Chriſt. The only ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
for preſervation in trials and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations
lies in that of the wiſe man:
<hi>Prov. 3. 5. Truſt in the Lord with all
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:115354:89"/>
Thine heart, and leane not to thine own
underſtanding.</hi> This is the <hi>worke</hi> of
faith: it <hi>is</hi> faith; it is to <hi>live</hi> by faith.
The great <hi>failing</hi> of men in trialls, is
their <hi>leaning to,</hi> or leaning <hi>upon,</hi> their
owne underſtanding and counſell.
What is the iſſue of it, <hi>Job. 18. 7. The
ſteps of his ſtrength ſhall be ſtraightned,
and his owne Counſell ſhall caſt him
downe.</hi> Firſt he ſhall be <hi>entangled,</hi> and
then caſt downe; and all by his <hi>own
counſell,</hi> untill he come to be aſhamed
of it, as <hi>Ephraim</hi> was, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 10. 6. When
ever in our trials, we conſult our own
underſtandings, hearken to ſelfe reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings,
though they ſeeme to be good
and tending to our preſervation,
yet the principle of living by faith is
ſtifled, and we ſhall in the iſſue be caſt
<hi>down by our own counſels;</hi> Now no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
can empty the heart of this ſelfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullneſſe,
but Faith, but living by it,
but, <hi>not living</hi> our ſelves, but having
Chriſt <hi>live</hi> in us, by our living by
Faith on him.</p>
            <p>2. Faith making the ſoule poore,
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:115354:89"/>
empty, helpleſſe, deſtitute in its ſelfe,
<hi>ingages</hi> the heart, will, and power of
Jeſus Chriſt, for Aſſiſtance, of which I
have ſpoken more at large elſewhere.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Love</hi> to the Saints, with care
that they ſuffer not upon our <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,</hi>
is a great preſerving principle
in a time of Temptations and trialls.
How powerfull this was in <hi>David,</hi> he
declares in that earneſt prayer, <hi>Pſal. 69.
6. Let not them that wait on thee, O Lord
God of Hoſts, be aſhamed for my ſake, let
not thoſe that ſeeke thee be confounded
for my ſake, O God of Iſrael.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>O let not me ſo miſcarry, that thoſe
for whom I would lay downe my life,
ſhould be put to ſhame, be evill ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
of, diſhonoured, reviled, contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
on my account, for my failings.
A ſelfiſh ſoule, whoſe love is turned
wholly inwards, will never abide in a
time of triall.</p>
            <p>Many other <hi>Conſiderations</hi> and <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,</hi>
that thoſe who keep the word
of Chriſt's patience in the way and
manner before deſcribed are attended
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:115354:90"/>
withall, might be enumerated, but I
ſhall content my ſelfe to have pointed
at theſe mentioned. And will it now be
eaſy to determine, whence it is that ſo
many in our dayes, are prevailed on, in
the time of trial: that the houre of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation
comes upon them, and beares
them <hi>downe,</hi> more or leſſe before it?
is it not becauſe amongſt the great
multitude of <hi>Profeſſors,</hi> that we have,
there are few that keep the word of the
patience of Chriſt? if we wilfully ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect,
or caſt away our <hi>intereſt</hi> in the
promiſe of preſervation, is it any won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
if we be not preſerved? There is
an <hi>houre</hi> of Temptation come upon the
world, to try them that dwell therein:
it variouſly exerts its power and effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy;
there is not any <hi>way,</hi> nor Thing,
wherein it may not be ſeene <hi>acting</hi> and
putting forth it ſelfe, in worldlineſſe,
in ſenſuality, in looſeneſſe of converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
in neglect of ſpirituall duties, pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate,
publicke, in fooliſh, looſe, diabo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall
opinions, in haughtineſſe and am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition;
in envy and wrath, in ſtrife
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:115354:90"/>
and debate, revenge, ſelfiſhneſſe, in
Atheiſme and contempt of God, doth
it appeare. They are but <hi>branches</hi> of
the ſame root, bitter ſtreames of the
ſame fountaine, cheriſhed by peace,
proſperity, ſecurity, apoſtaſies of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors
&amp; the like; &amp; alaſſe how many
do dayly fall under the power of this
Temptation, in generall? how few
keep their garments girt about them,
and undefiled? and if any urging parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Temptation, befall any, what
inſtances almoſt have we of any that
eſcape? may we not deſcribe our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
as the Apoſtle that of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians
in reſpect of an outward viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation;
<hi>ſome are ſick, and ſome are
weake, and many ſleep;</hi> ſome are woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
ſome defiled, many utterly loſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
What is the ſpring and fountaine of
this ſad condition of things? is it not,
as hath been ſaid; we doe not keep the
word of Chriſt's patience in univerſall
cloſe walking with him; and ſo loſe the
benefit of the <hi>promiſe</hi> given &amp; anne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xed
thereunto. Should I goe about
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:115354:91"/>
to give inſtances of this thing; of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors
coming ſhort of <hi>keeping the
word</hi> of Chriſt, it would be a long
worke. Theſe 4 heads would com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe
the moſt of them. 1. <hi>Conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi>
to the world, which Chriſt hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed
us from, almoſt in all things,
with joy and delight; in promiſcuous
compliances with the men of the
world. 2. <hi>Neglect</hi> of duties which
Chriſt hath enjoined, from cloſe me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation
to publick ordinances. 3.
<hi>Strife,</hi> variance, and debate among
our ſelves, woefull judging and deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
one another, upon account of
things forraigne to the bond of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
that is between the Saints.
4. <hi>Selfe-fulneſſe</hi> as to principles, and
ſelfiſhneſs as to ends. Now where
theſe things are, are not men <hi>car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall?</hi>
is the word of Chriſts pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
effectuall in them? ſhall
they be preſerved? they ſhall not.
Would you then be preſerved, and
kept from the hour of temptation;
would you watch againſt entring into
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:115354:91"/>
it, as deductions from what hath been
delivered in this Chapter: take the
enſuing Cautions.</p>
            <p>1 Take heed of leaning on deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
aſſiſtances; as 1 your owne <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſells,</hi>
underſtandings, reaſonings,
though you argue in them never ſo
plauſibly in your own defence, they
will <hi>leave</hi> you, <hi>betray</hi> you; when the
temptation comes to any height, they
will all turne about, and take part
with your enemy, and plead as much
for the matter of the temptation what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
it be, as they pleaded againſt the
end and iſſue of it before.</p>
            <p>2 The moſt vigorous actings by pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
faſting, &amp; other ſuch meanes againſt
that <hi>particular luſt,</hi> corruptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
wherewith you are exerciſed, &amp;
have to do. This will not avail you, if in
the mean time there be neglects, on
other accounts. To hear a man wreſtle,
cry, contend as to any particular of
Temptation, and immediatly fall into
<hi>wordly</hi> waies, worldly compliances,
looſeneſſe, and negligence in other
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:115354:92"/>
things; it is righteous with Jeſus
Chriſt to leave ſuch an one to the
<hi>hour</hi> of temptation.</p>
            <p>3 The generall <hi>ſecurity</hi> of Saints
perſeverance, and preſervation from
<hi>totall Apoſtaſy.</hi> Every ſecurity that
God gives us, is good in its kind, and
for the purpoſe for which it is given
to us; but when it is given for <hi>one</hi> end,
to <hi>uſe</hi> it for another, that is not good
or profitable. To make uſe of the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
aſſurance of preſervation from
<hi>totall Apoſtaſy,</hi> to ſupport the ſpirit in
reſpect of a <hi>particular temptation,</hi> will
not in the iſſue advantage the ſoule;
becauſe notwithſtanding that, <hi>this</hi> or
that temptation may prevaile. Many
releive themſelves with this, untill
they find themſelves in the <hi>depth</hi> of
perplexities.</p>
            <p>1 Apply your ſelves to this great
preſervation of <hi>faithfull</hi> keeping the
word of Chriſts patience in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt
of all trialls and temptations.</p>
            <p>2 In particular, wiſely co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſider wherein
the <hi>word of Chriſts patie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce</hi> is moſt like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:115354:92"/>
to ſuffer in the daies wherein we
live, and the ſeaſons that paſſe over us,
&amp; ſo vigorouſly ſet your ſelves to keep
it in that particular, peculiarly. You
will ſay, how ſhall we know wherein
the word of Chriſts patience in any
ſeaſon is like to ſuffer? I anſwer: con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
what workes he peculiarly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formes
in any ſeaſon, and neglect of
his word in reference to them, is that
wherein his word is like to ſuffer. For
inſtance; the workes of Chriſt, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
he hath been peculiarly ingaged in
our daies and ſeaſons, ſeeme to be
theſe.</p>
            <p>1 The <hi>powring of contempt</hi> upon
the great <hi>men</hi> and great <hi>things</hi> of the
world, with all the enjoyments of it.
He hath diſcovered the nakedneſſe of
all earthly Things, in <hi>overturning, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verturning,
overturning</hi> both men,
and things, to make way for the <hi>things
that cannot be ſhaken.</hi> 2. The owning
of the <hi>Lot</hi> of his own inheritance in a
diſtinguiſhing manner, putting a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
between the <hi>precious</hi> and the
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:115354:93"/>
               <hi>vile,</hi> and cauſing his people to dwell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone,
as not reckoned with the nations.
3. In being <hi>nigh</hi> to faith and prayer,
honouring them above all the <hi>ſtrength</hi>
and <hi>counſels</hi> of the ſons of men. 4. In
recovering his <hi>Ordinances</hi> and inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
from the carnall adminiſtrations
that they were in bondage under by
the luſts of men, bringing them forth
in the beauty and the power of the
ſpirit. Wherein then in ſuch a ſeaſon
muſt lie the <hi>peculiar</hi> neglect of the
<hi>word</hi> of Chriſts patience? is it not in
ſetting a <hi>value</hi> on the world and the
things of it, which he hath ſtained and
trampled <hi>under foot?</hi> is it not in the
<hi>ſlighting of his peculiar lot,</hi> his people,
and caſting them into the ſame conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations
with the men of the world?
is it not in leaning to our own coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels
and underſtandings? is it not in
the defilement of his ordinances, by
giving the outward court of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
to be trod upon by <hi>unſanctified</hi>
perſons. Let us then be watchfull, and
in theſe things keep the word of the
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:115354:93"/>
patience of Chriſt, if we love our own
preſervation. 5. In this frame urge
the Lord Jeſus Chriſt with his bleſſed
promiſes, with all the conſiderations
that may be apt to take and hold the
king in his galleries, that may worke
on the heart of our bleſſed and merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
High Prieſt, to give ſutable ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour
at time of need.</p>

            <head type="sub">A Generall exhortation to the Duty

            <p>HAving thus paſſed through the
Conſideration of the duty of
<hi>watching,</hi> that we <hi>enter not into temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,</hi>
I ſuppoſe I need not adde <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives</hi>
to the obſervance of it. Thoſe
who are not moved by their own ſad
experiences, nor the <hi>importance</hi> of
the duty, as laid down in the entrance
of this diſcourſe, muſt be left by me to
the farther patience of God. I ſhall on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſhut up the <hi>whole</hi> with a <hi>generall
Exhortation</hi> to them, who are in any
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:115354:94"/>
meaſure prepared for it, by the Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
of what hath been ſpoken.
Should you go into an <hi>hoſpitall,</hi> and ſee
many perſons lying <hi>ſick</hi> and weak, ſore
and wounded, with many filthy diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
and diſtempers, and ſhould enquire
of <hi>them,</hi> how they fell into this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
and they ſhould all agree to
tell you, <hi>ſuch,</hi> or <hi>ſuch</hi> a thing was the
occaſion of it; by that I got my <hi>wound</hi>
ſaies one, and my <hi>diſeaſe</hi> ſaies another;
would it not make you a little care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
how, or what you had to do with
that <hi>thing</hi> or <hi>place?</hi> ſurely it would.
Should you go to a <hi>dungeon,</hi> and ſee
many miſerable creatures bound in
chaines for an approaching day of exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution,
and inquire the way and means
whereby they were brought into that
condition, and they ſhould all fix on
<hi>one</hi> and the ſame thing, would you
not take care to avoid it? The <hi>caſe</hi> is
ſo with <hi>entring into temptation:</hi> ah!
how many poor, miſerably, ſpiritually,
<hi>wounded ſoules</hi> have we every where?
one wounded by <hi>one</hi> ſin, another by
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:115354:94"/>
another; one falling into <hi>filthineſse</hi> of
the fleſh, another of the ſpirit: aske
them nowhow they cameinto this ſtate
and condition; they muſt all anſwer,
<hi>alas!</hi> we <hi>entred into temptation,</hi> we
fell into curſed ſnares and intangle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and that hath brought us into
the woefull condition you ſee. Nay
if a man could <hi>look</hi> into the dungeons
of hell, and ſee the poor damned ſoules
that lie bound in chaines of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
and hear their cries: what would
he be taught? what do they ſay? are
they not curſing their Tempters, and
the Temptations that they entred in?
and ſhall we be negligent in this thing?
Salomon tells us, that the <hi>ſimple one</hi>
that followes the <hi>ſtrange woman, knows
not that the dead are there, that her
houſe inclineth to death, and her paths
to the dead:</hi> (which he repeats 3 times)
and that is the reaſon, that he ventures
on her ſnares. If you knew what hath
been done by <hi>entring into temptation,</hi>
perhaps you would be more watchfull
and carefull. Men may think that they
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:115354:95"/>
ſhall do well enough notwithſtanding;
but can a man take <hi>fire</hi> in his boſome,
and his cloathes not be <hi>burnt,</hi> can one
goe upon <hi>hot coales,</hi> and his feet not be
burnt, <hi>Prov.</hi> 7. 27. 28. No ſuch thing:
men come not off their temptation
without wounds, burnings, and ſcars. I
know not any place in the world where
there is more need of <hi>preſsing</hi> this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation
than in this place: Go to our
<hi>ſeverall Colledges,</hi> enquire for ſuch and
ſuch young men; what is the anſwer in
reſpect of many? ah! ſuch an one was
very <hi>hopefull</hi> for a ſeaſon, but he fell
into <hi>ill company</hi> &amp; he is quite loſt. Such
an one had ſome good beginning of
Religion, we were in great expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation
of him, but he is fallen into
temptation: And ſo in other places;
<hi>ſuch</hi> an one was uſefull and humble, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorned
the Goſpell, but now he is ſo
<hi>wofully</hi> intangled with the world, that
he is growne <hi>all ſelfe,</hi> hath no ſap nor
favour; ſuch an one was <hi>humble</hi> and
<hi>zelous,</hi> but he is advanced and hath
loſt his firſt love and wayes: oh how
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:115354:95"/>
full is the world, how full is this
place, of theſe wofull examples:
to ſay nothing of thoſe innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
poore creatures who are fallen in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>temptation</hi> by deluſions in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.
And is it not time for us to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake,
before it be too late; to watch a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the firſt riſings of ſin, the firſt at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts
of Satan, and all wayes whereby
he hath made his approaches to us, be
they never ſo harmeleſſe in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelves.</p>
            <p>Have we not experience of our
weakneſſe, our folly, the <hi>invincible
power of</hi> temptation when once it is
gotten within us. As for this duty
that I have inſiſted on, take theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations:</p>
            <p>1. If you neglect it, it being the
only means preſcribed by our Saviour,
you will certainly <hi>enter into temptation,</hi>
and as certainly fall into ſinne: flatter
not your ſelves; ſome of you are <hi>old
Diſciples,</hi> have a great <hi>abhorrency</hi> of
ſinne; you thinke it impoſſible you
ſhould ever be ſeduced ſo, and ſo:
but, <hi>let him</hi> (who ever he be) that
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:115354:96"/>
ſtandeth take heed leſt he fall: it is
not any grace received, it is not any
<hi>experience</hi> obtained, it is not any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution
improved, that will preſerve
you from any evill, unleſſe you ſtand
upon your <hi>watch:</hi> what I ſay to you,
ſayes Chriſt, I ſay to all; <hi>watch.</hi> Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
you may have had ſome good
ſucceſſe for a <hi>time,</hi> in your careleſſe
frame: but <hi>awake,</hi> admire God's ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe
and patience, or evill lyes at
the doore. If you will not performe
this duty, who ever you are, one way
or other, in one thing or other, ſpiritual
or carnall wickedneſſe, you will be tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted,
you will be defiled, and what will
be the end thereof? <hi>Remember Peter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Conſider that you are alwayes
under the eye of Chriſt, the great Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptaine
of our ſalvation, who hath en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned
us to <hi>watch</hi> thus, &amp; <hi>pray</hi> that we
enter not. What thinke you are the
thoughts, &amp; what the heart of Chriſt,
when he ſees a Temptation haſtening
towards us, a ſtorme riſing about us,
and we are faſt aſleep? doth it not grieve
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:115354:96"/>
him, to ſee us <hi>expoſe</hi> our ſelves ſo to dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
after he hath given us warning upon
warning? Whileſt he was in the dayes of
his fleſh, he conſidered his temptation
whileſt it was yet coming and armed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
againſt it: <hi>the Prince of this world
cometh,</hi> ſayes he, <hi>but he hath no part in me.</hi>
And ſhall we be negligent under his eye?
do but think that thou ſeeſt him coming
to thee, as he did to <hi>Peter</hi> when he was <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſleep</hi>
in the garden, with the ſame reproof,
<hi>what! canſt thou not watch one houre?</hi>
would it not be a grief to thee to be ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved,
or to heare him thundring againſt
thy neglect from heaven, as againſt the
Church of Sardis, <hi>Revel.</hi> 3. 2.</p>
            <p>3. Conſider that if thou neglect this
duty, and ſo <hi>fall into temptation,</hi> which aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuredly
thou wilt do, that when thou art
intangled, God may withall bring ſome
heavy affliction or judgment upon thee,
which by reaſon of thy <hi>intanglement,</hi>
thou ſhalt not be able to look on any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe,
than as an evidence of his anger
&amp; hatred: &amp; than what wilt thou do with
thy temptation and affliction together?
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:115354:97"/>
All thy <hi>bones</hi> will be broken, and thy
<hi>peace</hi> and ſtrength will be gone in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
This may ſeeme but as a noyſe
of words for the preſent, but if ever it be
thy condition, thou wilt find it to be <hi>full
of woe</hi> and bitterneſſe. Oh then let us
ſtrive to keep our ſpirits unintangled, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voiding
all appearance of evill, and all
wayes leading thereunto: eſpecially all
waies, buſineſſes, ſocieties, and imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
that we have already found diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous
to us.</p>
