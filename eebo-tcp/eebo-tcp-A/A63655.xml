         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg> Yee furious Zoilists, doe yee
imagine that your zeale is
good, or that your deeds
are lawfull, that in these
happy dayes of reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
will dare of your owne
accord to reforme as you list, as if you would
prevent the high and honourable Court of
Parliament? Will you bee the Iudge before
they have censured? Nay, will you be the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutioner
before they have judged? Will you
be so rash before they have determined? You
run too fast, that makes you stumble, you fall
ere you be aware, and take heed lest you bruise
you sore unexpected. Had wee no hope of
<pb facs="tcp:94339:3"/>
reformation in things amisse, it were the more
to be excused: but seeing reformation is even
now in acting by those glorious starres assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
for that very purpose, you are much to be
blamed to goe about it any other way. Bee
perswaded therefore, all you who presume to
be thus unruly, and trouble not the way that is
in working: Is not Gods time better then
yours? And is not a Parliament way beyond
and before your ignorant zeale? Are you grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved?
So are we. Would you be relieved? So
would we. But you are not in a way to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved,
if you will run your owne way. Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to that honourable Assembly, they will
judge your cause, whose whole study is to make
our Churches glorious: therefore stay your
hands, and be not so unruly.</p>

               <head>The Relation of the Scotchman.</head>
               <p>1. This Scotchman came into the Church
in the <hi>Old Iury,</hi> whilest the people were recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the Sacrament: here was a great offence,
<pb facs="tcp:94339:3"/>
to trouble them at such a time, when they were
about so great a worke. Is it a small matter to
disturb the people at the Sacrament? at such a
time the greatest charge concerning the prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
and the celebration whereof, is to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
it with peace? And doe but consider
what a great unkindnesse this was to disturb
them, and to make an uprore amongst them at
such a time? This was as great indignity as
could be offered.</p>
               <p>2. It was on the Sabbath day, the Sermon
being newly ended, which was a time in which
it was fitter for him to have hasted home, that
having refreshed himselfe with the creatures of
God, and dined, hee might have pondered of
what he had heard preached, and considered
of what hee had been taught concerning his
salvation looking to his own particular charge
and calling, preparing himself for the partaking
of the ordinances and worship of God in the
after-noon, that so he might have sanctified the
Sabbath to the Lord, and not have runne into
such strange and disorderly stratagems.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:94339:4"/>3. He was a Scotchman, an alien, wherein
appeares his great saucinesse, to be so bold, so
audaciously to trouble any of our Churches,
himselfe being a stranger, to take upon him to
regulate the affaires in our Churches, who
neither was a Magistrate, nor a Divine; no,
nor an English man, one of our owne nation,
but a Scotchman and a Laick that was of Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
how great is this boldnesse in him to teare
and spoile any thing in the Church as hee did,
having no right to any such calling, especially
in these times in which peace is so happily new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
established between us and them, and a day
of thankesgiving for that purpose celebrated
to the Lord.</p>
               <p>4. Hee went unto the Deske, where the
Church bookes lay, and tooke up the Service
booke in his hands; which the Clarke seeing,
endeavoured to take it from him, which before
he could doe, the Scotchman tore out a great
part of the leaves out of the booke: he made
marshall law with it, in which did appeare a
great deale of indignity to both the Minister,
<pb facs="tcp:94339:4"/>
people, yea, and to the Booke it selfe: he offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
injustice to the very booke, Iustice should
have permitted it to have had a triall, he might
have stayed untill the Parliament had regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the matter, there both he and it should have
had a faire triall, and just proceedings, and no
injustice offered to either part. But herein ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares
his unrighteous dealing to play the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutioner,
before a proceeding in any faire
triall.</p>
               <p>5. As he would have escaped forth of the
Church, he was stayed, and after evening pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
was brought before the Lord Maior. Had
he done well, hee needed not to feare: Now
is the glorious hopes of our reformation, and
had hee had a just Commission granted for
what he had done, from them in whose hands
the power is to reforme, hee needed not feare;
but he feared because he did evill, and is like to
know that the Magistrate beareth not the
sword in vaine.</p>
               <p>6. Being examined by the Lord Maior,
why he did so, he answered, that it troubled his
<pb facs="tcp:94339:5"/>
conscience. But see his folly herein, why should
it trouble his conscience, he being neither com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled
to use it, nor to partake with those that
did use it.</p>
               <p>7 The Lord Maior hath bound him over
to answer it at the next Sessions: to whom I
leave him to a triall, and advise him to humble
himselfe, and to repent for it, and to disswade
others from the like attempt.</p>
