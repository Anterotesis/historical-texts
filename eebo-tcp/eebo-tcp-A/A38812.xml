            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To Him that Reades.</head>
            <p>IF that be true which <hi>Demosthenes</hi> said, that Constancy is the summe of all perfection, and that what is really good springs from integrall causes; all that aspire to this Vertue should embrace whatever may contribute to it. I have in this gentle <hi>Satyr</hi> prepared you something to smile, something to frown at; if the Ballance fall even I am satisfyed: shall I tell you ingenuously? I have sometime (for Relaxation sake) indulg'd my self the liberty of a <hi>Prevaricator,</hi> and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst other impertinencies, to passe away the time, collected certain <hi>Essayes</hi> together, of which I once intended a Volume. <hi>This</hi> amongst the rest lay upmost; and if I now put it into your hands, 'tis because I think it not unseasonable: I will not reproch the <hi>French</hi> for their fruitful Invention, or any thing that is commendable, but 'tis well known, who those <hi>Gavaches</hi> are, which would impose upon all the World beside; and I have frequently wonder'd that a <hi>Nation</hi> so well conceited of themselves, as I take our Country-men to be, should so generally submit to the <hi>Mode</hi> of <hi>another,</hi> of whom they speak with so little kindnesse. That the <hi>Monsieurs</hi> have universally gotten the Ascendent over other parts of <hi>Europe,</hi> is imputable to their late <hi>Conquests;</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:52728:3"/>
but that only their greatest vanity should domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neer over <hi>Us,</hi> speaks us strangely tame. For my own part, though I love the <hi>French</hi> well (and have many reasons for it) yet I would be glad to pay my respects in any thing rather then my <hi>Clothes,</hi> because I conceive it so great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minution to our Native Country, and to the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion of it. His <hi>Majesty</hi> speaks <hi>French,</hi> not so much to gratify the <hi>Nation,</hi> as because he has <hi>Title</hi> to it: For though <hi>Lewis</hi> the XIIII. be the <hi>French King; CHARLES</hi> the II is <hi>King</hi> of <hi>France</hi>; and I shall not despair to see the day when he shall give his <hi>Vassals</hi> there the <hi>Edict</hi> for their <hi>Apparel,</hi> and not suffer his Subjects <hi>here</hi> to receive the Law from them. If this give you offence, I can commute, and upon some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther occasion, say as much to their advantage: in the interim my pardon will be my zeal and my loyalty; but if you think it wiser to need none, then to ask it, I embrace the sentence, but beg time to practise it; especially when I presume thus upon your patience, who professe my self to be so much</p>

               </gap>t where the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophie Mantle made all his Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers appear like so many Conju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers; 'tis worth the observing yet, that the People of <hi>Rome,</hi> left off the <hi>Toga,</hi> an Antient and Noble Garment with their power, and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:52728:4"/>
that the Vicissitude of their Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bite was little better then a Presage of that of their Fortune. For the Military <hi>Saga</hi> differencing them little from their Slaves, was no small indication of the declining of their Courage, which shortly follow'd; and I am of opinion, that when once we shall see the <hi>Venetian</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nat quit the gravity of their Vests, the State it self will not long sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist, without some considerable al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration. 'Tis not a triviall Remark (which I have some where met with) that when a Nation is able to impose, and give laws to the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit of another, (as the late <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars</hi> in <hi>China</hi>) it has (like that of Language) prov'd a Fore-runer of the spreading of their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quests there; because, as it has something of Magisterial; so it
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:52728:4"/>
gives them a boldnesse, and an Assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance which easily introduces them, without being taken notice of for Strangers where they come; so as by degrees, they insinuate themselves into all those Places where the <hi>Mode</hi> is taken up, and so much in credit. I am of Opinion, that the <hi>Swisse</hi> had not been now a Nation, but for keeping to their Prodigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Breeches; and as it was Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tickly dissembl'd of <hi>Francis</hi> the First to flatter this blunt People with the <hi>Toy,</hi> which for a while he wore, and the Ladies afterward made their Pin-Cushions of; so was it again as wise to abandon that Brutish Shape, for a Habit more convenient and Decent.</p>
            <p>Nor do I impute it so much to the Levity in that <hi>Protean</hi> Nation to <hi>Metamorphose</hi> themselves so oft',
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:52728:5"/>
as many are Prone to censure; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is plainly their Interest, and they thrive by it; besides the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of seeing all the World follow them, and to be fond of it.</p>
            <p>Believe it, <hi>La Mode de France,</hi> is one of the best Returnes which they make, and feeds as many bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, as it clothes Backs; or else, we should not hear of such Armies, and Swarmes of them, as this one City alone maintains, who hang in the Ears, embrace the Necks, and elegant Wasts of our fair Ladies in the likeness of <hi>Pendants, Collers, Fans</hi> and <hi>Peticoats,</hi> and the rest of those pretty impediments, without which Heaven and Earth could not subsist.</p>
            <p>It may be thought, I confesse, some mark of Verticity, that these things are alwayes in fluctuation;
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:52728:5"/>
but tis yet constant as the Tide, and no more a fault then in the <hi>Moon,</hi> espeeially, since (like hers) the change is profitable, and a <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racteristic</hi> of their fertil <hi>Genius,</hi> which is to be busie, Mercurial, and Universal, and like good <hi>Prismes,</hi> both to multiply, and change the <hi>Species</hi> to a degree so taking, and so gainfull.</p>
            <p>But, be it thus excusable in the <hi>French</hi> to alter, and impose the <hi>Mode</hi> on others, for the reasons de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd; 'tis no less a weakness, and a shame in the rest of the World, who have no Dependency on them, to admit them, at least, to that degree of Levity, as to turn into all their shapes without discrimination, so as when the freak takes our <hi>Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieurs</hi> to appear like so many <hi>Farces</hi> or <hi>Iack-Puddings</hi> on the Stage,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:52728:6"/>
all the World should alter Shape, and play the <hi>Pantomim's</hi> with them.</p>
            <p>Me thinks a <hi>French</hi> Taylor with his Ell in his hand, looks like the Enchantress <hi>Circes</hi> over the Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of <hi>Vlysses,</hi> and changes them into as many formes: One while we are made so loose in our Clothes, as if we had alwayes need of the Close-stool, and by and by appear like so many Malefactors sew'd up in sacks, as of old they were wont to treat a <hi>Parricide</hi> with a Dog, an Ape and a Serpent: Now must our Breeches do homage to the Roses of our Shoes, and be the next <hi>Term</hi> so short,<note place="margin">2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 10.4.</note> as if we had all been Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadors to the King of <hi>Ammon.</hi>
