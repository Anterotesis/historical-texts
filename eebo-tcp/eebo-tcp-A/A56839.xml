            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hough the Authour had ſome years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his lamented death, compos'd, review'd, and corrected theſe Eg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logues; yet, he left no Epiſtle to the Reader, but onely a Title, and a blanke leafe for that purpoſe.</p>
            <p>Whether he meant ſome Allegoricall expoſition of the Shepheards names, or their Eglogues, is doubtfull: but 'tis certain, that as they are, they appear a perfect pattern of the Authour; whoſe perſon, and minde, were both lovely, and his converſation ſuch as diſtill'd pleaſure, knowledge, and vertue, into his friends and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance.</p>
            <p>'Tis confeſt, theſe Eglogues are not ſo wholly divine as many of his publiſht Meditations, which ſpeak <hi>his affections to be ſet upon things that are above,</hi> and yet even ſuch men have their intermitted howres, and (as their company gives occaſion) commixtures of heavenly and earthly thoughts.</p>
            <p>You are therefore requeſted to fancy him caſt by for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune into the company of ſome yet unknown Shepheards: and you have a liberty to beleeve 'twas by this following accident.</p>
            <p>
               <q>
                  <pb facs="tcp:39556:3"/>He in a Sommers morning (about that howre when the great eye of Heaven firſt opens it ſelfe to give light to us mortals) walking a gentle pace to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards a Brook (whoſe Spring-head was not far di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant from his peacefull habitation) fitted with An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle, Lines, and Flyes: Flyes proper for that ſeaſon (being the fruitfull Month of <hi>May;</hi>) intending all di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence to beguile the timorous Trout, (with which that watry element abounded) obſerv'd a more then common concourſe of Shepheards, all bending their unwearied ſteps towards a pleaſant Meadow within his preſent proſpect, and had his eyes made more happy to behold the two fair Shepheardeſſes <hi>Amaryllis</hi> and <hi>Aminta</hi> ſtrewing the foot-paths with Lillies, and Ladyſmocks, ſo newly gathered by their fair hands, that they yet ſmelt more ſweet then the morning, and immediately met (attended with <hi>Clora Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinda,</hi> and many other Wood-nymphs) the fair and vertuous <hi>Parthenia:</hi> who after a courteous ſalutati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and inquiry of his intended Iourney, told him the neighbour-Shepheards of that part of <hi>Arcadia</hi> had dedicated that day to be kept holy to the honour of their great God <hi>Pan;</hi> and, that they had deſigned her Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſe of a Love-feaſt, which was to be kept that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent day, in an Arbour built that morning, for that
<pb facs="tcp:39556:3"/>
purpoſe; ſhe told him alſo, that <hi>Orpheus</hi> would bee there, and bring his Harp, <hi>Pan</hi> his Pipe, and <hi>Tite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> his Oaten-reed, to make muſick at this feaſt; ſhee therefore perſwaded him, not to loſe, but change that dayes pleaſure; before he could return an anſwer they were unawares entred into a living moving Lane, made of Shepheards and Pilgrimes; who had that morning meaſured many miles to be eye-witneſſes of that days pleaſure; this Lane led them into a large Arbour, whoſe wals were made of the yeelding Willow, and ſmooth Beech boughs: and covered over with Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camore leaves, and Honyſuccles.</q>
I might now tell in what manner (after her firſt entrance into this Arbour) <hi>Philoclea</hi> (<hi>Philoclea</hi> the fair <hi>Arcadian</hi> Shephear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſſe) crown'd her Temples with a Garland, with what flowers, and by whom 'twas made; I might tell what gueſts (beſides <hi>Aſtrea</hi> and <hi>Adonis</hi>) were at this feaſt; and who (beſide <hi>Mercury</hi>) waited at the Table, this I might tell: but may not, cannot expreſſe what muſick the Gods and Wood-nymphs made within; and the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nits, <hi>Larks,</hi> and Nightingales about this Arbour, during this holy day: which began in harmleſſe mirth, and (for <hi>Bacchus</hi> and his gang were abſent) ended in love and peace, which <hi>Pan</hi> (for he onely can doe it) continue in <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cadia, and reſtore to the diſturbed Iſland of</hi> Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tannia,
<pb facs="tcp:39556:4"/>
               <hi>and grant that each honeſt Shepheard may again ſit under his own Vine and Fig-tree, and feed his own flock, and with love enjoy the fruits of peace, and be more thankfull.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Reader, at this time and place, the Authour contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted a friendſhip with certain ſingle-hearted Shepheards: with whom (as he return'd from his River-recreations) he often reſted himſelfe, and whileſt in the calm evening their flocks fed about them, heard that diſcourſe, which (with the Shepheards names) is preſented in theſe Eg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logues.</p>
