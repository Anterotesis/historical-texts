         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IN true Love and good Will I have writ the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Treatiſe unto you, hoping it may find enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment with ſome among you, to give it the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and ſeriouſly to conſider what you read; and my earneſt Exhortation and Advice is unto you, that in all your reading, whether in this or any other Book, ye turn your minds to that Light of Chriſt within you, wherewith he hath enlightned you, and all Men, as the holy Scriptures declare; and that ye may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
<pb facs="tcp:55597:3"/>
in Chriſt, the Light, and Life, in you, who is the Wiſdom and Power of God, and who was in all the holy Prophets and Apoſtles, and whoſe Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit that was in them that gave forth the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, both of the Old and New Teſtament; and the ſame Spirit only doth, and only can give to all Readers of the holy Scripture, a true and right un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of them, and of all other Books, that treat of Doctrins and Matters of Religion, whether they have proceeded from a meaſure of the ſame holy Spirit: And if ye believe in Chriſt the Light, the Life, the Wiſdom and Power of God in you, and joyn your Minds to his inward divine Illumination, He will anoynt the Eyes of your <hi>Underſtanding,</hi> with his <hi>Spiritual Eye-Salve,</hi> and then your Eyes ſhall be opened to ſee and underſtand <hi>what ye read</hi>; and through your faith in him he will alſo open and circumciſe your inward Ears, and cauſe you ſtill more and more to be acquainted with his living Voice and Words in you, all which are Spirit and Life; and this will give you a ſpiritual ſavour and taſte, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by ye ſhall be able to try and judge of things that differ, whether Men, or Books, whether Spirits, or Doctrins, what are of God, and what are not of him; for although the Scriptures are the beſt out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Teſt or Touchſtone, or Rule whereby to try all Doctrins of Men, or Books, yet it is the holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Chriſt, and his Light inwardly ſhining and enlightning the dark Hearts and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtandings of Men, that gives them ability rightly to underſtand the Scriptures, otherwiſe the Scriptures are as a ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<pb facs="tcp:55597:3"/>
Book, both to the learned and unlearned: For though the <hi>Jews</hi> had the Scriptures of the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which prophecied of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and of <hi>the Time and Manner of his Coming,</hi> and how <hi>he was to ſuffer Death for the ſins of Men, and to riſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain and aſcend into Glory,</hi> yet none of them had that <hi>Underſtanding,</hi> but ſuch only as were turned <hi>to his divine Illumination in their Hearts,</hi> and were acquainted with his <hi>holy Spirit, Light and Life in them.</hi> And the like grave and whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom advice I recommend unto you, which a certain Ancient <hi>Chriſtian</hi> gave unto <hi>Juſtin Martyr,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Converſion to the Chriſtian Faith, to wit, <hi>That he ſhould diligently read and ſearch the holy Scriptures, which ſhould give him more Content than all</hi> Heathen <hi>Authors; but withal, that he ſhould mind the Gate, the LIGHT, by which only he could enter into the true Underſtanding and Knowledge of them.</hi> The which Paſſage the ſaid <hi>Juſtin</hi> relateth in his Works, and <hi>John Fox</hi> hath it alſo in his <hi>Martyrology</hi> taken out of him. And though in this Treatiſe I have affirmed and ſufficiently demonſtrated, that your <hi>Viſible Churches</hi> are no <hi>true Churches of Chriſt,</hi> yet I do not ſay nor conclude, that none of you belong to Chriſts true Church in any true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard: But on the contrary, I have that true Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, Faith and Hope concerning a Remnant among you, who have in the leaſt meaſure true Hunger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and Thirſtings after Righteouſneſs, and a great inward longing and panting of Heart and
<pb facs="tcp:55597:4"/>
Soul after the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, to know him and enjoy him, more nearly than by all hear-ſay or report of him, and whoſe Souls are ſick of Love for him, and feel your need and want of him, as the ſick that need the <hi>Phyſician,</hi> that ye do indeed, even all ſuch of you, belong to Christ, and are the real Members of his Body, which is his Church; for where any living Deſire is after Christ, and where any true ſenſe or feeling of the want and great need of him is raiſed in any Soul, there is ſomewhat of the Life of Chriſt in that Soul, and there is Chriſt himſelf pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, who hath begot it, and that Soul is in ſome Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure a living Member of Chriſt, and to ſuch it will be glad Tidings, to hear that Christ is ſo near unto it, as really to be within it, even really and livingly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent; and where the leaſt true meaſure of <hi>Sincerity, Tenderneſs, Meekneſs, Gentleneſs, Humility, Uprightneſs of Heart and Soul</hi> hath place in any, there is Chriſt <hi>preſent in that Soul,</hi> who hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready begun his <hi>good Work</hi> in the ſame, and the beginning of his Work is to <hi>quicken and make alive the Soul unto him.</hi> And every <hi>Soul</hi> that is thus quickned and made alive unto him, as it doth hold fast this Beginning, and doth continue ſtill hunger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and thirſting after Him, to know, and enjoy, and receive of his Fulneſs more plentifully, doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally belong to him, and is in a ſtate of <hi>Salvation</hi> e'en ſo far; and as it here abideth, it is <hi>impoſſible that it can periſh.</hi> But yet tho ſuch belong to Chriſt, and to his Church, it doth not follow, that the <hi>viſible
<pb facs="tcp:55597:4"/>
Church,</hi> which they are outwardly, and by ſome out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Form or Practice joyned unto, is the <hi>true Church of Chriſt</hi>; for they themſelves diſtinguiſh of the Church <hi>Viſible</hi> and <hi>Inviſible,</hi> and do affirm, <hi>That Hypocrites are Members of their Viſible Church, but that only the true Saints and Children of God, belong to the inviſible Church.</hi> And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, tho ſuch who have true Deſires, and true liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Breathings raiſed in them after the Lord, may be ſaid, as ſuch, to belong to him, and be of his Sheep, yet they are still but as ſcattered and driven from the true Fold, and as wandering, for most part, upon the barren Mountains, and the dry and deſolate Hills, ſeeking the living among the dead, until they come to be gathered into the <hi>True and Living Way of God,</hi> and of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> ſo as to know, and be acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the Lord, and his <hi>inward Leadings, Rule</hi> and <hi>Government</hi> in them, and to be able to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh his Voice, and <hi>inward appearance</hi> in them, from that of a ſtranger, and to worſhip him in <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi> and in <hi>Truth,</hi> and ſerve him in the <hi>newneſs of the Spirit,</hi> and in pure <hi>Holy Fear</hi> and <hi>Love,</hi> as Sons and Children in his Houſe: And this State ye are generally strangers unto, and therefore tho ſome of you may be allowed in true Charity, to be the <hi>Sheep of Chriſt,</hi> yet ye are but ſcattered until ye are returned unto Chriſt, the <hi>Shepherd</hi> and <hi>Biſhop</hi> of your Souls, and know him revealed in you, to lead, rule and guide you, and feed you with the living Bread,
<pb facs="tcp:55597:5"/>
and give you the living Water to drink, which he himſelf is, inwardly revealed, and that ye be turned away from all falſe Teachers and Shepherds, which is the earneſt breathing and cry of my Soul unto God for you.</p>

                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> It is a part of the counſel of God, for a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> to know his <hi>inward Calling,</hi> and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he be indeed one of God's <hi>called</hi> and <hi>choſen Ones</hi>; whether <hi>in favour with God,</hi> and <hi>juſtified</hi> and <hi>ſanctified?</hi> And though the Scripture doth give infallible Signs and Marks of ſuch an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, yet no Scripture, nor Scripture-conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence can infallibly aſſure any man that he hath theſe marks; but it is the <hi>ſpirit of God</hi> that only can and doth give them this aſſurance, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.16. 2<hi>dly,</hi> All true Preachers and Miniſters of Chriſt ought to know the mind and will of God, <hi>whether they be called of God to the Work of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry,</hi> which Call is an <hi>inward Call,</hi> that is alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether neceſſary to their faithful diſcharge of ſo great a Work; but this they cannot know ſimply by the Scripture. 3<hi>dly,</hi> Every true <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian</hi> ſhould know his inward Call, to <hi>Pray,</hi> or
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:55597:6"/>
                  <hi>give Thanks,</hi> or perform any Religious Duty or Service unto God, as <hi>David</hi> ſaid, <hi>When thou ſaid'st, Seek my Face; my Heart anſwered, thy Face, O Lord I will ſeek; hide not thy Face from me, Pſal.</hi> 27.8. Again, 4<hi>thly,</hi> It is commonly granted, that it is a Duty belonging to every <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> to enquire the Mind and Counſel of God in every weighty matter and concern of our Life; as if we be viſited with any great Affliction inward or outward, to enquire with <hi>Job, Shew me, O Lord, why thou contendeſt with me.</hi> And as <hi>Rebecca,</hi> when the Twins ſtrugled in her Womb, enquired at the Lord, and ſaid, <hi>Why am I thus?</hi> And the Lord anſwered her. Alſo in the caſe of Marriage, every true <hi>Chriſtian</hi> man and woman, ought to enquire and wait for God's counſel, with whom to be joyned in Marriage, that they may know indeed the Lord's joyning of them, and that they marry in the Lord: But this can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be known by any Scripture, or conſequence from Scripture, but the Spirit of the Lord muſt reveal it, even the ſame that led <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant to take a Wiſe to his Son <hi>Iſaac.</hi> And every <hi>Chriſtian</hi> ſhould know the will and counſel of God in his outward Vocation, that it is of God, and ſo abide therein, as the Scripture ſaith, <hi>Let every man abide in the Calling wherein he is called of God.</hi> And as the Servants of God in days paſt, in traveling and ſojourning from place to place, received the counſel of God, ſo do theſe now that wait for it in uprightneſs of Heart, as really as holy men did of old; and as <hi>Philip</hi> received
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:55597:7"/>
the Word of God, which he could not find in the Scripture, either expreſly or conſequentially, when the Spirit ſaid unto him, <hi>Joyn thy ſelf to this Chariot,</hi> when he was ſent to preach Chriſt to the Eunuch; and as <hi>Peter</hi> was ſent to <hi>Cornelius,</hi> and <hi>Ananias</hi> to <hi>Saul,</hi> and many other the like inſtances; and as <hi>James</hi> declareth, <hi>Men ought not to be raſh or haſty to ſay, to day, or to morrow we will go into ſuch a City,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>for that ye ought to ſay, If the Lord will,</hi> James 4.13, 15. Now how can a man know what the Lord willeth in ſuch a caſe, unleſs it be given him by the Spirit of the Lord inwardly, to feel either a Command or Permiſſion to do ſuch a thing? For whereas too many make the outward paſſages of Providence their rule, as to ſay, <hi>If Sickneſs, or ſome outward Impediment hinder not</hi>; they conſtitute that to be the Will of God: And whereas many remove from one place to another, and Divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence doth not hinder them, and yet in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval they have not had God's approbation, and it hath not had a bleſſing to follow it, but on the contrary; for leaving their place, they have been expoſed to ſad Temptations, and have fallen under them. And <hi>laſtly,</hi> there are many precious living Soliloquies and Intercourſes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Lord and the Souls of his dear Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, while he anſwers the returns of their Prayers in living Teſtimonies, and words of his Holy Spirit; which though they are agreeable to Scripture, yet are not expreſs Scripture words, but are the real Words and Dictates of the Holy
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:55597:7"/>
Ghoſt, ſpeaking Peace and Conſolation to them, beyond all utterance or demonſtration of Speech, and wonderfully quickning and ſtrengthning them in the inward man, as we find in the <hi>Pſalms,</hi> and in the <hi>Song of Solomon,</hi> and other places of holy Scripture; for by the living Word of God, as they come freſhly and newly, or immediately from the mouth or ſpirit of God, the Souls of God's Children are quickned and kept alive, as Chriſt ſaid, <hi>The words that he did ſpeak unto his Diſciples were Spirit and Life; and man liveth not by Bread alone, but by every Word that proceedeth out of the Mouth of God.</hi> And <hi>David</hi> waited for the coming of the Word of God to quicken him, to wit, that God might ſpeak unto him; and he ſaid, <hi>I will hear what the Lord will ſpeak, for he will ſpeak Peace to his Saints, and to his People.</hi> So here is God's Promiſe to all his Saints and People to ſpeak Peace unto them; and as he promiſed to his <hi>Iſrael</hi> in <hi>Hoſea,</hi> Chap. 14. <hi>I will allure or perſwade her, and bring her into the Wilderneſs, or a ſolitary place, and there I will ſpeak comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly unto her, or</hi> (as the <hi>Hebrew</hi> hath it) <hi>I will ſpeak to her Heart.</hi> And this is an inward Speech: And the Scripture Promiſes, when God is pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by his Spirit to apply them to the Souls of his Children, is as real and proper an inward Voice and Speaking of God unto them, as he ſpoke to the Prophets of old.</p>
               <p n="5">5. And therefore the Scripture doth not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain either all the Word, or Words of God, as ſome ſay, but many thouſands of Words of God
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:55597:8"/>
have been livingly ſpoke and utter'd by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God, to the inward Ears of his dear Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, ſince the writing of the Scripture, and daily are and will be to the end of the World. And as it was ſaid in the Apoſtles days, <hi>the Word of the Lord grew and multiplied,</hi> Acts 12.24 and 19, 20. ſo ever ſince the Apoſtles and writing of the Scriptures, the <hi>Word of God hath grown and mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplied,</hi> and ſtill ſhall and muſt to the end of the World; and yet no new Doctrin or Goſpel to be Preached, but the ſame which the Prophets, and Chriſt and the Apoſtles have already Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
               <p n="6">6. And as Chriſt and the Apoſtles expounded the Scriptures of the old Teſtament by divine In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration and Revelation of the ſame Spirit; without propounding any new Doctrin or ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of Faith unto People; ſo why may it not be ſo now? yea, it is ſo, that ſome at this day by the ſame Spirit, do expound and open places of Scripture both of the old and new Teſtament, and yet bring no new Doctrin: And it is a far better way to have ſuch Preachers and Expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, who open and expound the Scriptures by the Inſpiration and Revelation of the Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, as the Apoſtles did, than for men to preſume to open and expound them without all <hi>new Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation</hi> or <hi>Inſpiration,</hi> and who plainly confeſs, <hi>They neither Preach nor Write by any Infallible Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</hi> And ſuch mens Expoſition, who declare they have no infallible Spirit, can neither be the word or words of God, which are infallible, but only
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:55597:8"/>
the fallible word and words of man, and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Imaginations.</p>

               <head>CHAP. II. Concerning new divine Revelations and Inſpirations.</head>
               <p n="1">1. THe places of Scripture, which they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly bring againſt all <hi>new divine Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> and <hi>Inſpirations of the Spirit of God,</hi> prove no ſuch thing, as will eaſily appear to any that are impartial and unbyaſſed in their underſtanding, if they will but read and conſider them, which places are theſe following, as they are alledged and quoted by them called the <hi>Aſſembly of Divines at VVeſtminſter,</hi> in their <hi>Confeſſion of Faith,</hi> cap. 1. ſect. 1. <hi>Prov.</hi> 22.19, 20, 21. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 8.9, 10. which places, if they prove now, that all new Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is ceaſed, they do as much prove, that it ceaſed in the days of Chriſt and the Apoſtles, yea, in the days of the Prophets that did ſucced them. Is it not admirable blindneſs that theſe men did not ſee how impertinent theſe Citations are? And as for all the places of the new Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment cited by them, as <hi>Luke</hi> 3.4. <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.4.
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:55597:10"/>
                  <hi>Mat.</hi> 4.4, 7, 10. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.15. <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.1, 2. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.19. they do no more prove what theſe intend than the former; for by their own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, <hi>divine Revelation</hi> and <hi>Inſpiration</hi> continued after all theſe places of Scripture were writ, for divers intire Books of Scripture were writ after them here alledged: And if they ſay, that all <hi>new Revelation</hi> did ceaſe, as ſoon as all theſe Books of Scripture were in being, then they muſt alſo affirm, that all new Revelation did ceaſe to divers of the Apoſtles, long before they deceaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, becauſe divers of them, and particularly <hi>John</hi> ſurvived after he wrote his Book of the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. It is moſt readily granted, that God in his infinite Wiſdom and Goodneſs was pleaſed, that there ſhould be Oracles and Teſtimonies of his Truth and Goſpel committed to writing, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to which the Doctrins and Words of Men, however ſo holy, that ſhould come in after ages, ſhould be tryed and examined; <hi>for the Spirits of the Prophets are ſubject to the Prophets</hi>; but this doth not prove in any wiſe, all ceaſing of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy, or Divine Revelation, or Inſpiration by the ſame Spirit. The Apoſtles Doctrin and Preaching was tried by the Noble <hi>Bereans,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it was according to the Scriptures of the old Teſtament; but it doth not therefore follow, that the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> did not preach by divine Revelation and Inſpiration. And both Chriſt and the Apoſtles proved their Doctrin gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally out of the Scriptures of the Prophets; but
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:55597:10"/>
that doth not argue that they did not Preach by new divine Revelation.</p>
               <p n="3">3. But for the further clearing of the matter, we are to diſtinguiſh betwixt <hi>new Revelation</hi> of <hi>new Doctrin,</hi> and <hi>new Revelation</hi> of <hi>ancient Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin.</hi> The Apoſtles had a new Revelation, yet not of any new Doctrin, but the very ſame that Chriſt and the Prophets preached before them, and all agreed in the ſame Doctrin for Subſtance, and yet had their own peculiar Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions and Revelations, which were new to them, to wit, new, though not in kind or ſpecie, yet in particular or individual unto them. And ſo it is, as to us, we plead not for any new Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of any new Doctrin, Faith or Goſpel, differing from what Chriſt, and the Prophets, and Apoſtles have taught before us, and is large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and fully declared in the holy Scriptures; but for a new Revelation of the ſame Doctrin, Faith and Goſpel which was revealed unto them: For as the Faith of the Prophets and Apoſtles is not enough to us, but we muſt alſo <hi>have the like precious Faith with them,</hi> 1 John 1.2. and we muſt ſee with our <hi>ſpiritual Eyes,</hi> and hear with our <hi>ſpiritual Ears,</hi> and handle with our <hi>ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual handling</hi> the <hi>Word of Life,</hi> as they did, ſo it muſt be newly revealed to us, and in us.</p>
               <p n="4">4. And if all new divine <hi>Revelation</hi> and <hi>Inspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi> be ceaſed, then all ſpiritual ſeeing and hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is ceaſed, and neither God nor Chriſt is, or hath been heard or ſeen ſpiritually, as the Saints did ſee and hear formerly, nay, not in the leaſt
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:55597:11"/>
degree, and all inward ſpiritual Senſation and feeling is gone, and all uſe or exerciſe of ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Series, which is ſad tidings to poor Souls. But if any grant that there is any true and real ſpiritual <hi>hearing, ſeeing, taſting,</hi> and other ſpiritual Senſations of God, and divine things, they muſt alſo grant true divine <hi>Revalation</hi> the ſame in kind and nature with what the Saints had of old; for what is the proper object of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward hearing, and ſeeing, and taſting, and feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; Is it not God and Chriſt? As <hi>David</hi> invited others ſaying, <hi>O taste and ſee that God is good.</hi> And as the Spouſe ſaid in the Song, <hi>I ſate down under his Shadow with great delight, and his Fruit was ſweet unto my taſte; his, Left-hand is under my Head, and his Right hand doth embrace me; he hath brought me to his banqueting Houſe,</hi> &amp;c. and again, <hi>The King hath brought me into his Wine-Cellar.</hi> And can theſe ſweet and heavenly Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periences be witneſſed without <hi>divine Revelation,</hi> or <hi>Inspiration</hi>?</p>
               <p>And whereas ſome ſay, <hi>It is Revelation by the Word and Spirit going along together, but not by the Spirit alone without the Word.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I Anſwer, granting it to be ſo in a true ſenſe; for the Prophets and Apoſtles had both the Word and the Spirit going along together in their <hi>divine Revelations,</hi> according to <hi>Iſa.</hi> 50.21. and that did not hinder them to be real and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per in their kind. But that God hath limited and confined himſelf ſo, as never to give any inward enjoynment of himſelf to the Souls of his
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:55597:11"/>
dear Children, by any inward ſenſe, ſight or hearing, but what is conveyed unto them always by means of Scripture words, is a moſt extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant preſumption to affirm, without all Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture proof; for beſides that, the Soul may hear God ſpeaking other words to it inwardly, than expreſs Scripture words, though not contrary or diſagreeing; it oft falls out, that the inward and ſpiritual ſeeing, taſting and feeling may be enjoyed and witneſſed, without all words com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of Letters or Syllables, even <hi>in a deep in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſtillness and quietness,</hi> according to theſe words, <hi>Be ſtill, and know that I am God.</hi> And as the outward ſeeing, taſting, ſmelling and feeling may be uſed without the preſent uſe of the outward hearing, ſo may the inward and ſpiritual ſeeing, taſting, ſmelling and feeling be uſed at times and ſeaſons, without the inward and ſpiritual hearing of any Words formally compoſed of Letters and Syllables, or Scripture words, or ſo much as inwardly thought or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, which Men of ſpiritual Experience, who have their ſpiritual Senſes cannot but readily grant. We find by common experience, that Words fall ſhort to give us a ſufficient and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactory knowledge of outward and natural things; and therefore we deſire rather to ſee, taſte and handle them, than to hear the beſt or moſt true report of them. We love rather to ſee a pleaſant Country, than to hear of it only; and every good Child loveth to ſee his Parents, rather than to hear a report, or talk of them;
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:55597:12"/>
ſo every loving Wife loveth rather to ſee her Husband, and hear himſelf, and be imbraced by him, than to hear others tell of him: And the loving Subject is more glad to ſee his Prince, or King, of whom he hath received ſo many Favours, and to hear himſelf, than to hear others tell of him; and thus it is with every Soul, that truly loveth God, they much ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther deſire to hear himſelf, and ſee him, than to hear others tell of him, as one well ſaid, <hi>It is little to ſee Christ in a Book, but to ſee him, and hear him, and feel his moſt lovely Embraces, as his Children have witneſſed, that is very precious.</hi> It is not the report, or diſcourſe of Bread, however ſo true and large, that can ſatisfie an hungry man, or the report of good Drink that can ſatisfie a thirſty Man; but to taſte and eat of Bread, that only ſatisfieth him that is hungry, and to taſte and drink of Water, Beer, Wine, or any other refreſhing Liquor, only ſatisfieth the thirſty Man: And ſo to eat of Chriſt, and feed upon him who is the Soul's proper food and nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, doth, and only can ſatisfie and content the hungry Soul, as Chriſt ſaid, <hi>John</hi> 6.57. <hi>He that eateth me, ſhall live by me.</hi> And Chriſt is not only the Soul's Meat, but its Drink alſo; and therefore <hi>David</hi> ſaid, <hi>As the Hart panteth after the Water-Brook, ſo panteth my Soul after thee, O God; my Soul thirſteth for God, for the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving God,</hi> Pſal. 42.1, 2. And ſurely, this ſo near and inward enjoyment of God and Chriſt cannot be without an inward and intimate, or
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:55597:12"/>
immediate Revelation of him. And if words fall ſhort to give to men a ſufficient and ſatisfactory knowledg of natural and outward things, how much more then to give a ſufficient and ſatisfacto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry knowledg of God and Chirſt, and Divine things, as his Love, his Life, his Peace, and that inward Comfort and Conſolation that is in his preſence? For the Scripture ſaith, 1 Cor. 2.9, 10. <hi>Ear hath not heard, nor Eye hath not ſeen, nor hath the Heart of man conceived the good things that God hath prepared for them that love him, and wait for him</hi>: Where we ſee all words fall ſhort to diſcover theſe things; <hi>But God hath revealed them to us</hi> (ſaid <hi>Paul</hi>) <hi>by his Spirit.</hi> And this God did promiſe as a general priviledg to all his People, of all Nations, even to bring them to his holy Mountain, and to deſtroy the face of the Covering ſpread over them, and make unto them <hi>a Feaſt of fat things, full of Marrow, and of Wines upon the Lees well refined</hi>: And what is this but the enjoyment of himſelf, ſeen and taſted by them? And do not all true Believers <hi>eat the ſame ſpiritual Bread,</hi> and <hi>drink the ſame ſpiritual Drink, the Rock that followed</hi> Iſrael <hi>of old?</hi> which Rock was Chriſt? And ſurely this is beyond all Words or Declaration, and according to this the joy of God's People is called <hi>a Joy unſpeakable,</hi> even ſuch as words cannot expreſs; and the <hi>Peace of God</hi> is ſaid <hi>to paſs <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderstanding,</hi> and the <hi>love of Chriſt, that it paſſeth Knowledg,</hi> becauſe no Words, either ſpoken or conceived by men, can give the knowledg of theſe ſo great and divine
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:55597:13"/>
and profound Myſteries, but only the Spirit of God, that ſearcheth the deep things of God, can diſcover them. Again, we find by common ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, that all outward teaching of men, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuppoſe certain Principles of knowledg of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural things, which they profeſs to teach, which Principles are partly known (without men's teaching) by the outward ſenſe of them, and partly by inward Notions of Knowledg, innate in the minds of men; and therefore it were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together in vain, for a Maſter of <hi>Architecture</hi> or <hi>Navigation,</hi> to teach a man theſe Arts, who is altogether blind, and ſenſeleſs, and ſtupid, and hath not any inward clearneſs of his natural judgment; and even ſo it is, as to ſpiritural and divine things, all outward teaching of them doth pre-ſuppoſe ſome Principles of Knowledg of theſe very things, and ſome inward divine and ſpiritual Senſe of them, or at leaſt ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ground and capacity, whereby that divine Senſe may be excited in them. And therefore when <hi>Paul</hi> Preached to the <hi>Athenians,</hi> that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed themſelves ignorant of God, he Preached him, <hi>Acts</hi> 17.16, 27, 28. <hi>near unto them,</hi> yea, ſo near, as the Stock or Root of a Tree is unto the Bud or off-ſpring that groweth upon it; and this he proved from ſome of their own <hi>Poets,</hi> who ſaid of men, <hi>that they are God's off-ſpring</hi>; and he told them plainly the way to ſeek him, and find him, was <hi>by feeling him</hi>; ſo that he joyneth theſe three together, to wit, <hi>ſeeking, feeling</hi> and <hi>finding</hi>; for as a man in a dark Room,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:55597:13"/>
or having his Eyes ſhut, being perſwaded that the thing he deſireth to have, is at hand, or near to him, doth grope, and feel after it, and by feeling, doth within a little time find it; even thus did <hi>Paul</hi> teach theſe ignorant <hi>Athenians</hi> how they might find God, and how all men, however ſo ignorant, have a time or opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty given them to find him, God having deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined the times before-appointed, and bounds of Habitation, wherein they may find him: And ſo from this inward Ground, or Principle of Knowledg in theſe <hi>Athenians,</hi> which they had before <hi>Paul</hi> Preached unto them, as a wiſe Maſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er-Builder or Teacher, he proceedeth to Preach Chriſt, and the Reſurrection, and eternal Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment unto them, as a good Maſter or Teacher of natural Science beginneth with the firſt Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Knowledg, not to teach them, but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuppoſing them, and only calling the minds of the Scholars to remember, or take notice of them, and then from theſe Principles he proceedeth to teach them the myſteries of the Science.</p>

But whereas many who deny all new Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Spirit, yet grant the neceſſity of the inward Illumination of the Spirit of God, <hi>To give the ſaving Knowledg and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding of God and divine things,</hi> as theſe who gave forth the <hi>Weſtminster</hi> Confeſſion of Faith, being an Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly made up of <hi>Presbyterian</hi> and <hi>Independent</hi> Teachers, met at <hi>VVeſtminster</hi> about forty Years ago; ſee <hi>Cap.</hi> 1. <hi>Sect.</hi>

had been rightly acquainted with the <hi>inward Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of the Spirit of God,</hi> they would never have writ or given forth ſuch Non-ſenſe and Contradiction in the face of the World, as to grant the <hi>neceſſity of inward Illumination,</hi> and at the ſame time, yea, in the ſame Section or Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graph, and within a Line or two, to <hi>deny all new Revelation</hi>; for indeed <hi>inward Illumination</hi> is <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation,</hi> and <hi>inward Revelation</hi> is <hi>Illumination,</hi> the thing is one, though the Names be diſtinct, as oft the ſame thing is expreſſed by variety of Names; and the places of Scripture they bring to prove, the <hi>neceſſity of the inward illumination of the Spirit,</hi> do prove the <hi>inward Revelation of the Spirit,</hi> both which are one, as <hi>John</hi> 6.45. and 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.9, 10, 11, 12. <hi>It is written in the Prophets, They ſhall all be taught of God; every man therefore that hath heard and learned of the Father, cometh unto me.</hi> And that other place in 1 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 2.9, 10, 11, 12. <hi>As it is written, Eye hath not ſeen, nor Ear heard, neither have entred into the Heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him: But God hath revealed them to us by his Spirit; for the Spirit ſearcheth all things, even the deep things of God. For what man know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the things of a man, ſave the Spirit of a man which is in him? Even ſo the things of God knoweth no man, but the Spirit of God. Now we have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived not the Spirit of the VVorld, but the Spirit which is of God, whereby we know the things that are freely given us of God.</hi> There cannot be brought out of the whole Scripture more ſuitable
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:55597:14"/>
places, to prove the <hi>neceſſity of divine Revelation</hi> than theſe are, the one plainly implying it, the other plainly expreſſing it. For to be taught of God, to hear and learn of the Father, as the Prophets and Apoſtles did, what is it, but to be taught by <hi>divine inward Revelation</hi>? Or if they will ſay <hi>Nay,</hi> then the Prophets and Apoſtles were not taught of God, by the ſame Argument. And whereas they bring <hi>Paul</hi>'s words, ſaying, <hi>God hath revealed them to us,</hi> to wit, <hi>theſe deep things of God,</hi> to prove the inward Illumination of the Spirit of God to all Saints, as well as to <hi>Paul</hi>; the ſame proveth <hi>divine Revelation,</hi> as it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly ſo called by <hi>Paul</hi> in this very place; for they muſt needs grant, that the <hi>divine Illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> which <hi>Paul</hi> had, was <hi>Revelation,</hi> properly ſo called, and what he had he holdeth it forth, as common in kind to all Saints and Believers. And as for the word <hi>Revelation,</hi> as ſignifying an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward operation of the holy Spirit in the Heart and Underſtanding, we find it to be a phraſe more frequently uſed in Scripture, than the word <hi>Illumination,</hi> or <hi>Illuminated,</hi> or <hi>Enlightned,</hi> or to <hi>Enlighten</hi>; yea, I find the word <hi>Illuminated</hi> out once uſed in all the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Tranſlation of the whole Bible, but <hi>Revelation</hi> frequently is uſed in our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Tranſlation, and <hi>reveal, revealed</hi>; ſee <hi>Iſa.</hi> 40.5. and 53.1. and 56.1. <hi>Jer.</hi> 33.6. <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.27, 25. <hi>Luke</hi> 10.21, 22. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.18. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2 10. <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.16.3.23. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.15. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.17.

ſhould have ſuch a grudge and prejudice at all <hi>new Revelation,</hi> a Word ſo frequently uſed in Scripture, and yet pretend ſo great kindneſs to <hi>new inward Illumination,</hi> which is the ſame; for it paſſeth their skill, or any Mans elſe, to divide or ſeparate the one from the other.</p>
               <p n="6">6. But the great knack, nicety or myſtery of this diſtinction lieth in this, that <hi>inward Illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation</hi> is only <hi>Revelation,</hi> ſubjective or effective; and in that ſenſe, ſome of that ſort of Men, ſay, <hi>They own the neceſſity of inward Revelation, and hold it to be all one with Illumination.</hi> But they deny all inward objective Illumination, or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation, that is to ſay, any inward Revelation of any inward object, inwardly propoſed to the Eye or Ear, or other inward ſpiritual Senſe and Faculty of the Soul, the alone object of the Souls whole <hi>kowledge, faith, fruition, enjoyment of God,</hi> and <hi>communion with him,</hi> being the Scriptures, or God, Chriſt and divine things not in themſelves ſeen, or enjoyed, but as they are to be ſeen and known, or revealed in the words of Scripture: Hence they who uſe this diſtinction, ſay, the <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Light,</hi> or <hi>Illumination</hi> of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> being only <hi>effective,</hi> or <hi>ſubjective,</hi> but not <hi>objective,</hi> i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>medium incognitum aſſentiendi,</hi> or <hi>principium incog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitum cognoſcendi,</hi> that is to ſay, an unknown Principle, or mean of knowing and aſſenting, which may be illuſtrated by this ſimilitude, that there is an inward vigour of Life, and natural Spirits, that are neceſſary to enable the outward Eye to ſee outward things and Objects; but that
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:55597:15"/>
inward vigor of natural Life and Spirits, is not the object of the Eye, nor ſeen by it; or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſome may, or do underſtand by <hi>ſubjective inward Revelation,</hi> or Revelation on the part of the ſubject, the Soul's inward knowledge, or perception, as in the outward ſight of things of this World there is the viſion of the Eye, or its ſight and perception, and the Object ſeen, and perceived by the Eye: Alſo, in <hi>hearing,</hi> there is the hearing, or perception of the Ear, and the thing heard, be it Voice, or ſound of Man, Beaſt or Bird, or muſical Inſtrument. And thus, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording unto theſe Mens Doctrin, the alone adequate formal Object of all <hi>faith, knowledge, fruition, enjoyment, ſight</hi> and <hi>ſenſe</hi> of the Souls of the moſt excellent Saints, either now living, or that have lived in all Ages paſt ſince the Apoſtles lived, is the Scripture-words. But this is all meerly begged, and taken for granted, without all proof, and altogether contradictory to the experience of all the true Saints of God, who have an inward ſight, knowledge and enjoyment of God, far ſurpaſſing all Words or Writings; And thus, according to theſe Mens Doctrin, all the knowledge or ſight that the Saints have of God in this Life, is but as one that ſeeth <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> in a Map: but never ſaw the Land it ſelf; or as an hungry Man, heareth and readeth good words of Meat, but neither ſeeth, nor taſteth it; and as a Woman heareth of a Husband ſhe is mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried unto, or ſeeth his Picture on a Table, or on Paper, or readeth a Book that deſcribeth his
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:55597:16"/>
Beauty and Perſonage, but is never admitted to ſee him, or hear himſelf, nor to touch, handle or embrace him; all which are ſad tydings to Souls that love God and Chriſt; but the beſt is, they are utterly falſe, and the experience of the Saints abundantly prove them to be falſe; and ſuch dark ignorant blind Doctrin, proveth ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently what dark ignorant blind Men theſe have been, or are, who have publiſhed their own ſhame and folly to the face of the World, and as blind and ignorant are theſe Teachers, who have ſince received and publiſhed the ſame blind Doctrin. But if the inward Light, or Illumination be altogether an unknown Principle to him that hath it, having no Evidence, or Light, or Demonſtration of its own, whereby to diſcover it, how ſhall any Man be ſure, or know ſurely that he hath any inward divine Light or Illumination; for no Scripture can tell him that he hath it, or that he hath the Works of one that is divinely illuminated. One would think the bear naming, or mentioning ſuch Doctrin, is enough to refute it, as to ſay, God and Chriſt is, and can only be known by words, or report and hear-ſay, whereas the Scripture ſaith, <hi>Ear hath not heard, nor Eye ſeen, what theſe things are, which God hath prepared for his Children</hi>: And yet all Scripture words the Ear doth hear, and the Eye doth ſee,</p>
               <p n="7">7. But to come to the Concluſion of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, it is to be noticed, or conſidred that there is a Doctrinal and ſenſible knowledge of
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:55597:16"/>
God, or <hi>diſcurſive</hi> and <hi>intuitive</hi>; as for the <hi>do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrinal</hi> and <hi>diſcurſive</hi> knowledge of God, it is granted, that it cannot be without words, either of Scripture, or ſome other words given by the ſame Spirit; and alſo it is granted, that Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture words, in God's ordinary way, are neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to give to Men the ſaid <hi>doctrinal knowledge</hi> of God and Chriſt, and many deep and myſterious things of the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Faith and Religion; but this doth not prove the ceaſing of <hi>new divine Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation,</hi> but rather indeed eſtabliſheth it; for the Prophets and Apoſtles, who had <hi>divine Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,</hi> were profited, taught and edified by their Fellow-Prophets and Apoſtles; and eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally the latter Prophets, were much helped by the Words and Writings of the fore-going Prophets, as <hi>Daniel</hi> confeſſed, he underſtood by Books, to wit, by <hi>Jeremiah</hi> his Prophecy, the number of the years of the Captivity, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.2. And Chriſt opened the underſtanding of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, to underſtand the Scriptures of the Old Teſtament, what they did declare of him; and <hi>Paul</hi> freely confeſſeth, that the Scriptures of the Prophets were writ for his Learning, as well as of other Men, and yet he had great plenty of <hi>divine Revelation,</hi> beyond what many of them had; and <hi>David</hi> ſaid, <hi>he had more knowledge than his Teachers,</hi> and yet no doubt profited by them, and eſpecially by the Prophet <hi>Samuel,</hi> and others that lived with him, and before him. Next, as to the <hi>ſenſible</hi> and <hi>intuitive knowledge of God,</hi> it can be, and oft is without all Words, either out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:55597:17"/>
heard, or inwardly conceived, I mean words conſiſting of Letters or Syllables, ſuch as are not the things, but ſigns of things, even as we have a ſenſible and intuitive knowledge of a Land, by ſeeing it, and eating the Fruit of it, and drinking the good Wine or Milk of it, tho' we are not hearing or reading of it, nor think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of any words that ever we read or heard of it. And ſo, often the Souls of God's people enjoy a ſweet ſight, taſte, and repaſt of him in a deep inward quiet and ſtillneſs of mind, having no words of any ſort, that can be expreſſed in Letters or Syllables, ſo much as in their preſent thoughts or remembrance; and this is the moſt excellent degree of Knowledge, and as far excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth and tranſcendeth the other ſort, as the ſight taſte and feeling of a thing doth the report or hear-ſay of it. It is alſo acknowledged, that oft it pleaſeth God, to joyn of his Life to Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture words, as <hi>Promiſes, Prophecies,</hi> or any others, as we hear, read, or meditate on them, and make them as Conduits, Pipes or Ciſterns, or as Cups and Flaggons, to convey the divine Influences of his Life, and living Spirit of Life, and love to our Souls, but then they hinder not our <hi>Revelation,</hi> to be real, and true, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per <hi>Revelation,</hi> as well <hi>objective,</hi> as <hi>ſubjective</hi>; for as in drinking of outward Wine in a Glaſs, or Cup, we not only ſee the Glaſs or Cup, that revealeth the Wine, but alſo the Wine it ſelf, and the Wine is the moſt deſirable, and pleaſant and acceptable object of both our ſight and taſte,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:55597:17"/>
and feeling, ſo that we regard the Glaſs or Cup little or nothing for it ſelf, but for its uſe and ſervice to us; and if there be no Wine, or other refreſhing Liquor in the Cup, we care not to uſe it, it hath no taſte unto us, nor ſervice, but as the Wine is in it: And thus it is with the living Soul, that thirſts after the living God, and to drink of his Spirit, that quickens and refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Soul, when it ſeeth or perceiveth any divine Vertue or Life (as God is pleaſed, when, how, or by whom to joyn of the ſame to it) in Scripture words, either preached, read, or me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditated, it is very glad, and moſt gladly maketh uſe of them, and giveth God thanks for his great mercy; but without Life be joyned unto them, it is no more wiſdom, nor diſcretion to uſe them, than for a Man to put an empty Flaggon or Cup to his Mouth to drink at it.</p>
               <p n="8">8. But if they ſay, <hi>There is no ſenſible or intu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itive knowledge of God in this Life, at leaſt ſince the Apoſtles days</hi>; as indeed it is moſt, yea, alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether moſt agreeable to their Doctrin, who ſay, <hi>All new Revelation of the Spirit is ceaſed</hi>; then I ſay unto them, they are miſerable Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forters, yea, miſerable and ſad Goſpellers to poor <hi>Sion</hi>; they bring not glad, but ſad tydings; they cannot ſay, <hi>Behold, O</hi> Sion, <hi>thy King cometh unto thee</hi>; they cannot ſay, <hi>Taſte, and ſee that God is good</hi>; they cannot ſay, <hi>The Life was ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted, and we have ſeen it, and declare it unto you, that ye may have fellowſhip with us</hi>; they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not declare the <hi>great kindness</hi> and <hi>love</hi> that Chriſt
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:55597:18"/>
the Soul's Husband and Bridegroom hath to his Bride, but rather, their Doctrin preacheth him to be moſt unkind, and unnatural, never to let his Bride ſee him once all her Life, here in this World, nor yet once to hear himſelf, or taſte, or touch, or handle him, or be embraced by him. They preach altogether an abſent Chriſt, as ſome of them ſay, <hi>Chriſt is not really and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly in his People, or if preſent, a Chriſt altogether either dumb or ſilent, that being ſo near to the Soul, as to be in it, never ſpeaketh one word in it, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways hideth his Face, and never giveth to the Soul one glance or ſhine of his Countenance.</hi> But if they be aſhamed of this Doctrin, which yet is the very purport of it, who deny all <hi>inward nèw Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation,</hi> and <hi>new Viſitations</hi> of the Lord's love unto the Souls of his People, then let them be aſhamed to preach, teach, or write, that there is no <hi>new Revelation</hi> of God and Chriſt, nor no <hi>immediate</hi> or <hi>inward teaching,</hi> no <hi>inward</hi> and <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate calling,</hi> or <hi>ſending</hi> to the Miniſtry; and let them be aſhamed to own themſelves to be the Succeſſors of the ancient <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> who did acknowledge <hi>immediate Teaching,</hi> and <hi>calling un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Miniſtry,</hi> and the <hi>Spirit of Prophecy</hi>; and ſome of them had it, as <hi>George Wiſhard,</hi> and others, whoſe Prophecies <hi>Fox</hi> in his Book of Martyrs hath recorded.</p>
               <p n="9">9. And whereas theſe Faith-publiſhers at <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter,</hi> one while <hi>deny all new Revelation,</hi> ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther while ſeem only to <hi>deny extraordinary Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,</hi> as they term it, <hi>cap.</hi> 18. <hi>ſection</hi> 3. is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:55597:18"/>
piece of Non-ſenſe, or Contradiction; for if all <hi>new Revelation</hi> be ceaſed, as they expreſly affirm, <hi>cap.</hi> 1. <hi>ſect.</hi> 1. and 6. then there is neither ordinary nor extraordinary Revelation remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, according unto their Doctrin. But the diſtinction of <hi>ordinary</hi> and <hi>extraordinary Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,</hi> may in a true ſenſe, be well admitted by them who believe, that <hi>divine inward Revelation</hi> is not ceaſed; for among the Prophets, <hi>Numb.</hi> 12.6, 7, 8. <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Revelation far exceeded the Revelation of the other Prophets, as is clear from Scripture, and in that reſpect was extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary: And we now plead for <hi>new divine Revelation,</hi> we mean not <hi>extraordinary,</hi> beyond what God was pleaſed to give to his Saints and Children, in an <hi>ordinary</hi> and <hi>uſual way,</hi> from the beginning of the World, more or leſs, nor do we compare our Revelations with either the Prophets or Apoſtles, by way of equality, either in degree, or in all the various manners and ways which they had then: But we ſay, in that one way and manner, which was by God's <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward appearance,</hi> and <hi>ſpeaking in their Hearts,</hi> in the divine Seed and Birth, we do plead for <hi>divine Revelation,</hi> as the <hi>ordinary</hi> and <hi>common allowance</hi> and <hi>priviledge</hi> of all God's Saints and People, and not only to Saints, but to Men and Women, in order to their becoming Saints, they need God and Chriſt inwardly to ſpeak unto them; for it is the inward Voice and Speaking of Chriſt, that quickneth the dead Souls of Men, according to the words of Chriſt, <hi>The Dead ſhall hear the

               <p>IT hath been already acknowledged in the firſt Chapter, that the holy Scriptures are a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient outward Rule and Standard, whereby to try all Doctrins of Men, however ſo holy or wiſe they may be, or however much indued with the holy Spirit, becauſe the Spirit of the Prophets is ſubject to the Prophets; and as the holy <hi>Spirit of Truth</hi> is one, ſo the words of it do all agree, in all the true <hi>Prophets, Apostles, Evangeliſts, Pastors</hi> and <hi>Teachers</hi>; and as is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſaid, the Noble <hi>Bereans</hi> were commended in Scripture, for ſearching the Scriptures to ſee and examin, whether the Apoſtles Doctrin was according to the Doctrin of the ancient Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets that wrote the Old Teſtament; and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til the Apoſtles Doctrin was generally received, they did appeal to the Scriptures of the Old Teſtament, for a proof of their Doctrin, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though that was not their only proof; for they had a greater proof than that outward was, even the inward Witnéſs and Teſtimony of the holy

Therefore Wiſdom is a degree above Underſtanding, and Underſtanding a degree above Knowledge, all which divine Meaſures are ſet in order, as the parts of a Tree, with Root, Branches and Tops, or as the Members of a Mans Body, by way of Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory

and Analogy, <hi>Cochmah, Binah</hi> and <hi>Daath,</hi> belonging to the Head, <hi>Gedulah, Geburah</hi> to the right and left Hand and Arm, <hi>Tipheret</hi> to the Body, <hi>Neſah, Hod</hi> and <hi>Jeſod</hi> to the Thighs and Legs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and <hi>Mulcuth</hi> loweſt of all; all which make up, by way only of allegory and analogy the Parts and Members of the <hi>Son of Man,</hi> or heavenly <hi>Adam,</hi> as both <hi>Ezekiel</hi> and <hi>John</hi> ſaw him upon his Throne. The Engliſh Names of theſe Hebrew words, all which are found in Scripture, in their true order, are theſe following, <hi>Cochmah,</hi> i e. Wiſdom, <hi>Binah,</hi> i. e. Underſtanding or Prudence, <hi>Daath,</hi> i. e. Knowledge, (ſee 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29.11) <hi>Gedulah,</hi> i. e. Magnificence, <hi>Geburah,</hi> i. e. Power, <hi>Tipheret,</hi> i. e. Beauty, <hi>Neſah</hi> and <hi>Hod,</hi> i. e. Victory and Glory, <hi>Jeſod,</hi> i. e. Foundation, and <hi>Mulcuth,</hi> i. e. the Kingdom. And ſecondly and moſt eſpecially, we give the Preheminence to the Scriptures be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all latter Writers, becauſe we are well aſſured that the Scriptures throughout are pure, without all mixture of Error or Miſtake; and this is generally granted by all Chriſtians, that the Scriptures are really ſo, being duly and rightly tranſlated, but we are not aſſured that any mans or mens Writings ſince, are altogether pure and free of all mixture of Error and human Weakneſs, until they be duly examined and found to agree to the holy Scriptures, and to the inward teſtimony of the holy Spirit; for altho' whatever the Spirit of God inwardly revealeth, is infallible and pure from all mixture of Error, and whatever
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:55597:21"/>
any man <hi>ſaith</hi> or <hi>writeth,</hi> as he hath receiv'd it from that, his Teſtimony is pure, and without mixture; yet we are not aſſured that any man or men are in that ſtate of Perfection, that they may not by human frality, in ſome meaſure or way, more or leſs, decline or depart from the <hi>pure</hi> and <hi>infallible Teachings of the Spirit of God</hi>; for as it is poſſible they may purely and chaſtely keep unto them, ſo for want of due watchfulneſs and holy care, they may more or leſs depart from them, and ſo there may be a mixture of Truth and Error, both in their Underſtandings and Words; and therefore they are not to be taken on truſt, but both their Doctrin in all things is to be tryed by the Scripture, and their Spirit by the Spirit of Truth, as every one is able, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to what he hath received. All which doth not hinder but that the <hi>Spirit of God</hi> in our day both teacheth and leadeth infallibly, although the Diſciples and profeſſed Followers of it at times, by weakneſs, may be liable to miſtakes.</p>
               <p n="3">3. And as concerning that phraſe or expreſſion that ſome uſe, <hi>That the Spirit of God speaking in the Scriptures, is the ſupream Judge of all Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies of Religion,</hi> although it is no Scripture phraſe, nor proper, but figurative, as when a man is ſaid to ſpeak in his Books or Writings; yet in a figurative ſenſe it might be allowed, if they did not confine all the ſpeaking of the ſpirit of God to his only and alone ſpeaking in the Scriptures, ſo as that the Spirit ſpeaketh not at all, as they would have it, in the Souls and Hearts
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:55597:21"/>
of Men, as he uſed to do in the Prophets and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles. And becauſe they have a wrong ſenſe of it, and that it is not proper, but figurative, it is better not to uſe it. And in the room of it, I ſay, the Spirit of God ſpeaking in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in the Heart of every true Believer and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual man, opening and expounding the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture unto him, in the due and diligent uſe of reading, hearing, and meditation of Scripture words, or any other means of God's appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for our Inſtitution, and eſpecially in the frequent uſe of fervent and earneſt Prayer, pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing earneſtly with <hi>David,</hi> who was richly indued with <hi>divine Revelation, Open my Eyes, that I may ſee the wonderful things of thy Law</hi>; and moſt eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially in our being found in the way of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, and faithful Obedience, to what is already revealed unto us; for as we are found here, we have good warrant to expect that where any doubt, or Controverſie in Doctrin, or in the meaning of a place of Scripture doth ariſe, that God's holy Spirit, whom Chriſt hath promiſed to his Diſciples, to <hi>teach them all things, and to lead them into all Truth,</hi> will indeed judge and decide the matter in queſtion, in their Hearts, by his ſecret Light, and Teaching or Revelation. And let it be noted, that I ſay, it is not the Spirit abſtractly conſidered from the Scriptures, or our due uſe of them, or the duty that God requireth of us, but it is the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit opening, or expounding the Scriptures unto us, in <hi>reading, hearing, meditation, prayer,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:55597:22"/>
waiting,</hi> and <hi>obedience</hi> to what we already know, that it is the Judge of all Controverſie in matter of Doctrin.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Next, as to the <hi>Rule,</hi> as the Scripture is the beſt and only external or outward Rule and Standard, it is worthily preferred to all other outward Records and Teſtimonies; yet becauſe we both believe the Scriptures not ſimply for their own Teſtimony, but for the inward Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Teſtimony of the Spirit, and alſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we can only underſtand the Scriptures but by the ſaid inward Witneſs and Teſtimony of the holy Spirit; therefore the inward Witneſs of the ſpirit, or the ſpirit inwardly witneſſing both to the truth, and true ſenſe of Scripture, is the greateſt and primary Rule, as <hi>John</hi> plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly teſtified, ſaying, <hi>If we receive the Testimony of Men, the Testimony or Witness of God is greater; and he that believes hath the Witness in himſelf, and hath ſet to his Seal that God is true.</hi> And therefore <hi>Paul</hi> recommended his Doctrin to the <hi>Witness of the Spirit</hi> in the Hearts and Conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Hearers, and told the <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 1.5. that his Goſpel came unto them <hi>not in word only, but in Power, and in the holy Ghoſt, and in much aſſurance</hi>: And he told the <hi>Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> that <hi>their Faith was to ſtand in the Power of God</hi>; and therefore <hi>not in the bare words</hi> that he preached, for he did not preach himſelf, nor his Words, but Chriſt to be the Foundation of their Faith.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Concerning miniſterial Gifts and Qualifications, and the Call to the Miniſtry; the nature and manner of true Preaching, and Praying, and Singing, and the true Goſpel-Maintenance to the Miniſtry.</hi>
                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p n="1">1. BEcauſe of the near and cloſe connexion and dependance, that the things mentioned in the Title of this Chapter, have with the truth of what is delivered in the preceeding Chapters, therefore I do ſee it meet to treat of them in this place. The common Doctrin and Opinion of theſe, who deny all new Revelation of the holy Spirit, is, that natural and acquired Parts of Letter-learning, without <hi>divine inward Revelation</hi> or <hi>Inspiration,</hi> is ſufficient to qualifie a man to be a Miniſter of the Goſpel, and is neceſſary to his <hi>eſſe</hi> or <hi>being</hi> of a Miniſter, and Grace or true Piety and Holineſs, is only accidental, and doth but only contribute to his <hi>bene eſſe,</hi> or making him the better. By Letter-learning, they do not only mean human Arts and Sciences, and the knowledge of <hi>Greek, Hebrew</hi> and <hi>Latin,</hi> but eſpecially a Letter-knowledge of the Scripture, without any ſaving Grace, or illumination of the Spirit, as being eſſential to a Miniſter: And indeed they ſay agreeable enough to their own Doctrin; for if all new Revelation of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:55597:23"/>
is ceaſed, what is left behind to qualifie a Man to be a Miniſter, but only natural and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired parts of Letter-learning? Nor can they with any Reaſon, affirm, according to their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin, that true Piety and Holineſs is eſſential to a Miniſter, otherwiſe no Man is a Miniſter without it, and then it doth follow, that no Man can infallibly be known whether he be a real Miniſter, yea or nay; for if divine inward Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation be ceaſed, then all infallible diſcerning of Mens Spirits, and ſpiritual eſtates is ceaſed, and no Man can know another infallibly, whether he be a Saint or Hypocrite; for they grant that a Hypocrite may have all the outwards of a true <hi>Christian,</hi> as the <hi>Phariſees</hi> that made clean the outſide, but their inward was full of Rottenneſs and Uncleanneſs. And if a Man cannot be known to be a true Miniſter, according to their Doctrin, the People are in a woful caſe, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning that they call their <hi>Sacraments,</hi> and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially that called the <hi>Supper,</hi> which they ſay cannot be adminiſtred but by a true and real Miniſter; and if any that is not a true Miniſter, ſhould preſume to do any ſuch thing, as to Bleſs, or Conſecrate, and ſet apart the Bread and Wine from common uſe, it would be no <hi>Sacrament</hi> at all, as ſome, or moſt of them affirm.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Now that divine Revelation and Inſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is neceſſary to the Being or Eſſential Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of a Miniſter of Chriſt, is evident from the Doctrin already delivered; becauſe it is neceſſary to the <hi>being</hi> or <hi>eſſential</hi> Conſtitution of
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:55597:23"/>
every true <hi>Chriſtian.</hi> No man is, or can be a true <hi>Chriſtian</hi> without inward divine Revelation or Inſpiration, and therefore without the ſame, no man can be a true <hi>Christian,</hi> or Goſpel-Miniſter, for that which is abſolutely neceſſary to conſtitute a true <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> or Believer, is abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly neceſſary to conſtitute a true <hi>Christian</hi> Miniſter, otherwiſe it might be ſaid, a man may be a true Chriſtian Miniſter, and yet no true Chriſtian. But every true Miniſter of Chriſt, as he ought to be a true Chriſtian, ſo he ought to be more than an ordinary Chriſtian, ſo as to exceed or excel them, both in Spiritual Knowledge, and other ſpiritual Gifts, even as in natural teaching, the Maſter or Teacher ſhould exceed the Scholar; for if Divine Inward Revelation, and Inſpiration, together with other ſpiritual Gifts, are the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon priviledg of all true <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> in ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, more or leſs, according to their ſeveral growth and capacity, much more are they to be found in the true Miniſters of Chriſt, who are both to feed the Babes with Milk, and the ſtrong Men with Meat, and to be, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.19, 20. the guide of the Blind, a Light of them which are in Darkneſs, and Inſtructors of the Fooliſh, and Teachers of Babes, and alſo who can ſpeak Wiſdom among them that are perfect; accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to which Chriſt ſaid to his Apoſtles, <hi>Ye are the Light of the World, and the Salt of the Earth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. But more particularly, it is apparent from the Scripture, that there is a peculiar Miniſterial Gift or Gifts, that God giveth to all his true
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:55597:24"/>
Miniſters, to fit or qualifie them for that great Work, whereby to make them able Miniſters of the New-Teſtament, not of the Letter, but of the Spirit; the which Gifts are the Purchaſe of Chriſt, and the Fruits and Effects of his Death, Reſurrection and Aſcenſion, as is clear from <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.8, 11, 12. <hi>When he aſcended on high, he led Captivity captive, and gave Gifts unto men, and he gave ſome Apoſtles, and ſome Prophets, and ſome Evangeliſts, Paſtors and Teachers.</hi> Where altho' it may be granted, that ſome of theſe are extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary, as namely, Apoſtles, and ſome ordinary, yet all are given to the Church by Chriſt, as the Fruit and Effect of his Purchaſe; and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all ordinary Miniſters, who are indeed true Miniſters of Chriſt, are indued with ſome meaſure of Spiritual Gifts, in more or leſs, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the good pleaſure of God. And as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the ſpiritual <hi>peculiar gifts</hi> of the <hi>holy Spirit</hi> (beſides theſe that were common to all, ſuch as <hi>Faith, Love, Hope, Knowledge, Meekneſs, Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance, Patience, Brotherly-kindneſs, Charity</hi>) the Scripture doth expreſly mention them in divers places, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.8. <hi>To one is given by the Spirit, the Word,</hi> i. e. Speech or utterance of Wiſdom, <hi>to another the VVord of Knowledg</hi> (that is, ſome degree inferior) <hi>to another Faith,</hi> that is, ſome peculiar degree of Faith, for ſome peculiar Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, beſides the Faith common to all Believers; and all theſe are ordinary, and have ſtill remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the true Church; but together with theſe in the Apoſtles days, there were extraordinary
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:55597:24"/>
Gifts; which God may give, or with-hold, as he pleaſeth; as not being eſſential to a true Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter of Chriſt; ſuch were Gifts of Miracles, Gifts of Healing, Gifts of Tongues, and the like. And as concerning <hi>Prophecying,</hi> it was ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther extraordinary, or ordinary; extraordinary was a fore-telling of particular things to come, as was that of <hi>Agabus,</hi> his fore-telling that <hi>Paul</hi> ſhould be bound at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi>; ordinary, was the ordinary and uſual manner of Preaching by the Inſpiration and motion of the holy Ghoſt, in <hi>Doctrin, Exhortation, Correction,</hi> &amp;c. Moreover concerning this diverſity of ſpiritual Gifts, <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, Rom. 12.6. <hi>Having then Gifts, differing according to the Grace that is given to us, whether Prophecy, let us prophecy according to the proportion of Faith; or Ministry, let us wait on our Miniſtry, or he that teacheth, on teaching, or he that exhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, on exhortation.</hi> And likewiſe <hi>Peter,</hi> concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe ſpiritual Gifts, ſaith, 1 Pet. 4.10, 11. <hi>As every Man hath received the Gift, even ſo mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter the ſame one to another, as good Stewards of the manifold Grace of God. If any Man ſpeak, let him ſpeak as the Oracles of God: If any Man minister, let him do it as of the Ability</hi> (or vertue) <hi>which God giveth, that God in all things may be glorified through Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> And as touching <hi>ſpiritual Gifts,</hi> that were not common to all <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> but peculiar to ſome, <hi>Paul</hi> exhorted the belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving <hi>Corinthians,</hi> ſaying, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.1. <hi>Deſire ſpiritual Gifts, but rather that ye may prophecy.</hi> And he declareth what that prophecying was, <hi>verſ</hi> 3.
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:55597:25"/>
                  <hi>He that propheſieth speaketh unto Men, to Edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and Exhortation, and Comfort.</hi> And <hi>verſ.</hi> 5. <hi>Greater is he that propheſieth, than he that ſpeaketh with Tongues, except he interpret, that the Church may receive edifying.</hi> And concerning the great power and virtue of Prophecying, he ſaid fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, verſ. 24, 25. <hi>If all Propheſie, and there come in one that believeth not, or unlearned, he is convinced of all, he is judged of all: And thus are the ſecrets of his Heart made manifeſt, and ſo fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the Perſon,</hi> to wit, (that did Propheſie) for ſo the Words may be better tranſlated) <hi>he will worſhip God, and report that God is in you of a truth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Now in the true Church, and among the true Believers, there was a <hi>ſpiritual diſcerning</hi> or <hi>judgment</hi> that they had, whereby they did know who had theſe <hi>ſpiritual Gifts,</hi> and who had them not, who ſpoke, and preached by the Spirit, and who did pray and ſing by the Spirit, and who did not, and who not only had the Words, but the Power, and who had only the Words, and had not the Power; and theſe were falſe A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, and falſe Teachers, and Hypocrites, that had good Words, which they did take or receive from other Men, but had not that good Power and Spirit that was in the true Miniſters of Chriſt, and becauſe they had not that good Power, their Miniſtry and Words were dead, dry and barren; and ſuch the Scripture compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth to Clouds without Rain, and Wells or Ciſterns without Water; and of ſuch <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:55597:25"/>
                  <hi>he would know not the Speech of them which are puf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed up, but the Power,</hi> 1 Cor. 4.19. The which <hi>ſpiritual diſcerning</hi> or <hi>judgment,</hi> as it was in ſome meaſure given in common to all true Believers, as the ſenſe of Taſte is given in common to Beaſts &amp; Mankind, whereby to <hi>reliſh</hi> things ſweet or bitter, and Meats and Drinks, that have the true Nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Virtue in them, ſo it was given in ſome grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter meaſure to ſome than to others, according to their growth, experience, and exerciſe or uſe of their ſpiritual ſenſes, even as both among Men and Beaſts, ſome do far excell others in the ſaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of the Taſte of outward things, and ſo in the Smell of things, as Flowers, Spices, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and according to this <hi>ſpiritual diſcerning</hi> and <hi>judgment, Paul</hi> ſaid to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> 1 Cor. 14, 29. &amp;c. <hi>Let the Prophets ſpeak two or three, and let the other judge: If any thing be revealed to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that ſitteth by, let the firſt hold his peace; for ye may all prophecy one by one, that all may learn, and all may be comforted, and the Spirits of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets are ſubject to the Prophets: For God is not the Author of Confuſion, but of Peace, as in all the Churches of the Saints.</hi> So, we ſee here was good Order, where in one Meeting two or three might ſpeak one after another, or more, if they had any motion of the Spirit ſo to do, and in that caſe, the firſt ſpeaker was to give place to him: But nothing of this is to be found among theſe <hi>Churches</hi> who deny all inward new <hi>Revelation</hi> of the Spirit, but one Man muſt take up all the time, and preach over the People one Year, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:55597:26"/>
another, and the people ever learning, and yet never able to come to the knowledge of the Truth, as was the manner of falſe Teachers in days paſt, who had the Form of Godlineſs, but denyed the Power thereof, who were to be tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned from, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.5, 6, 7. And concerning the trying and knowing of Spirits, as well as Doctrins, the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> writ in his General Epiſtle, 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.1. <hi>Believe not every Spirit, but try the Spirits, whether they are of God.</hi> Now this ability to try Spirits, is greater than bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to try whether a Man's Doctrin be true or falſe; for it is poſſible a Man may Preach for an hour, or more, words of Doctrin that may be true, and yet his Spirit not be of God. And that which gave them this Ability, to try all Spirits, as well as Doctrins, was the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nction,</hi> or anointing from the <hi>holy One</hi> which they had received, 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.20, <hi>But ye have an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nction, from the holy 'One, and ye know all things.</hi> And verſ. 26, 27. <hi>Theſe things have I written unto you, concerning them that ſeduce you,</hi> i. e. ſeek to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce you) <hi>But the anointing which ye have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of him, abideth in you, and ye need not that any Man teach you, but as the ſame Anointing teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth you of all things,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="5">5. But becauſe it is taken for granted, and laid down for a Fundamental among <hi>Presbyterians</hi> and <hi>Independent</hi> Teachers, as well as many others, <hi>That all inward divine Revelation and Inſpiration, ſuch as Believers had in the time of the Apoſtles, is ceaſed,</hi> therefore they lay no claim to any of
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:55597:26"/>
theſe ſpiritual Gifts, and plainly confeſs they have them not, and alſo that <hi>they have no Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble diſcerning</hi> or <hi>knowledge</hi> what Men are truly <hi>gracious,</hi> and <hi>holy,</hi> and <hi>living Members of Chriſt's Body,</hi> and what not. And therefore when theſe and other places of Scripture are brought, that declare how true Miniſters of Chriſt had ſpiritual Gifts of Miniſtration, ſome in a leſſer degree, and ſome in a greater, they alledge, <hi>all theſe Gifts are now ceaſed</hi>; and the reaſon they give, is, <hi>becauſe all inward divine Revelation and Inſpiration, ſuch as the Saints formerly had, is altogether ceaſed.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as if they did grant, that <hi>inward divine Revelation</hi> did continue, they would alſo readily grant, that theſe <hi>ſpiritual Gifts of Miniſtry</hi> did continue, and a <hi>spiritual diſcerning</hi> and <hi>ability,</hi> whereby to know <hi>Infallibly</hi> who were indeed indued with the <hi>Spirit of God,</hi> and who did preach and pray by the <hi>Spirit,</hi> or ſing by the <hi>Spirit,</hi> and who not. And the like concerning the <hi>Miniſterial Call,</hi> if they did grant, that <hi>divine inward Revelation</hi> and <hi>Inſpiration</hi> did continue in the Church, as the common Priviledge of all true and ſound Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, as being given to all and every one of them, <hi>to lead them into all Truth,</hi> they would readily enough grant, that <hi>Miniſters had an inward Call to preach,</hi> and exerciſe other Miniſterial Services and Performances, as theſe Miniſters did of old. So that indeed this their Doctrin, <hi>That inward divine Revelation is ceaſed in the Church, and in Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers,</hi> is the foundation of many other falſe and pernicious Doctrins, yea, almoſt of all the
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:55597:27"/>
falſe and erroneous Doctrins they have among them. And ſince it is ſo, that they have no Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of having the Spirit of God inwardly inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring them, and revealing in them the things of God, and inwardly teaching them the Myſteries of the Kingdom, What is their Miniſtry, or Church or Ordinances? All made things of Mans making, and inventing, and ſetting up; a <hi>Man-made Church, Man-made Ministry, Man-made Ordinances,</hi> and a <hi>Man-made Worſhip.</hi> And though they ſay, they hope they have the Spirit, and ſeem at times to lay great ſtreſs and weight upon it, and the need of it, <hi>not only to believe, but to do all good and acceptable Works and Perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances,</hi> yet their blind Doctrin and Unbelief, <hi>that all inward divine Revelation is ceaſed,</hi> doth ſo blind and darken them, generally, and make them ſo ſpiritually ſtupid, ſenſeleſs and benummed, that they plainly confeſs, <hi>They have no infallible aſſurance,</hi> or <hi>infallible knowledge that they have the Spirit of God,</hi> or any of theſe <hi>gracius Motions</hi> and <hi>Operations of the holy Spirit.</hi> For according to their blind Doctrin and Faith, all the moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and operations of the Spirit are <hi>only effective,</hi> but none of them <hi>objective,</hi> and any Illumination that they have is only <hi>effective,</hi> and not <hi>objective,</hi> that is to ſay, is no immediate object of their knowledge, or feeling, or ſpiritual perception, the Spirit only works in them, ſo to ſpeak, as fire or heat works in Stone, or Iron, or Wood, but the Stone, Iron or Wood hath not any inward ſenſe or perception of it; for if they did grant,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:55597:27"/>
                  <hi>true ſpiritual ſenſe</hi> and <hi>ſpiritual feeling</hi> or <hi>perception,</hi> they would grant <hi>infallible knowledge</hi> of theſe things, even as our outward ſenſes, when ſound and duly qualified, and within due circumſtances, give us an <hi>infallible knowledge</hi> of outward things; for is not every ſenſible Child infallibly ſure that it both ſeeth its Mother, and feeleth her, when the Mother is handling the Child, and feeding it? And doth not the Suckling on the breaſt ſurely know the Milk that it ſucketh, and can well diſtinguiſh the breaſt that hath Milk in it, from that which is dry and empty? But as the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> ſaith, <hi>Things made,</hi> (to wit, the things of Mans making, without the Spirit and Power of God inwardly revealed) <hi>are all to be removed,</hi> Heb. 12.26, 27. <hi>Yet once more I ſhake not the Earth only, but alſo Heaven.</hi> And this word <hi>yet once more,</hi> ſignifieth, the removing of theſe things, that may be ſhaken, as of things that are made, that thoſe things which cannot be ſhaken may remain. Let them conſider this, who ſeem to themſelves to have a <hi>Church Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, Miniſtry, Diſcipline, Worſhip,</hi> far above others, as Heaven is above Earth, as the <hi>Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian Church</hi> thinks ſhe is above the <hi>Epiſcopal,</hi> the <hi>Independent Church</hi> thinks ſhe is above the <hi>Presbyterian,</hi> the <hi>Baptiſts</hi> think themſelves above both, and yet all theſe, as well as others, are open and declared Enemies to the holy Spirit, his <hi>inward Revelation</hi> and <hi>Inſpiration,</hi> by which alone the true Church is a living Church, and the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry a living Miniſtry, and every true Member
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:55597:28"/>
a living Member, and all truly Religions, Duties and Services are living. But made things of Mans making, are all dead things, and therefore muſt all be ſhaken and removed, not the made Earth only, but the made Heavens alſo, of Mans making, <hi>made Faiths, made Worſhips, made Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters, made Covenants,</hi> all things of Mens making without the Spirit and Power of God inwardly revealed, muſt all be removed, <hi>and every plant that is not of the heavenly Fathers planting, muſt be plucked up.</hi> But if any of them ſay, <hi>Our Churches, our Miniſtry, our Faith, our Worſhip, our Covenant is not ſo, for we have the ſpirit of God aſſiſting us, and working together with us.</hi> This anſwer is but a meer preſumption or Conjecture, ſeeing they deny all inward <hi>Revelation</hi> and <hi>Inſpiration</hi> of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> which gave the Believers and Saints in former ages, an <hi>infallible kowledge</hi> and <hi>aſſurance</hi> that they had the <hi>Spirit of God</hi>; for the Spirit that they claim unto, as they ſay, <hi>doth only work in them effectively,</hi> but not by way of <hi>object</hi>; it is altogether an unknown mean or principle of operation, it hath no proper light, or evidence, or demonſtration of its own, ſuch as the Spirit that was in the Apoſtles is <hi>no infallible spirit,</hi> that they have, but <hi>fallible,</hi> and therefore their <hi>Faith</hi> is <hi>fallible,</hi> their <hi>Knowledge fallible,</hi> their <hi>Hope fallible,</hi> and every thing in them <hi>fallible, dubious, conjectural</hi> and <hi>uncertain,</hi> and they only think that they have the Spirit of God, and a ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al knowledge of things; and when asked, they dare not ſay, their thought hath any infallible
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:55597:28"/>
aſſurance in it; as all true aſſurance is <hi>Infallible</hi>; yea, ſome of them are ſo dark, ignorant and blind, that to me in my hearing, have affirmed, <hi>That the Apoſtle</hi> Paul <hi>was not infallibly ſure that he had the Spirit of God,</hi> bringing <hi>Paul's</hi> words, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.40. <hi>I think alſo, that I have the Spirit of God.</hi> But according to his <hi>blind argument,</hi> the holy Ghoſt is not <hi>infallibly ſure,</hi> for the ſame Greek word is applied to the holy Ghoſt, <hi>Acts</hi> 15.28. <hi>It ſeemed good to the holy Ghost</hi>; but this is blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous to think or affirm, and I ſee not how they can clear their Doctrin of Blaſphemy, to ſay, <hi>That they have the Spirit of God,</hi> and yet to affirm, <hi>That they have no Infallible Spirit</hi>: The plain Engliſh of which is, that the Spirit of God and God himſelf is fallible.</p>
               <p n="6">6. But the great cauſe and reaſon, why all true Miniſters and Preachers of the Goſpel ſhould not only be truly godly and holy Men, but alſo ſhould be indued with ſome more than ordinary power of the holy Spirit, and communications thereof, not common to all <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> at leaſt in degree, though one ſpirit in all, is, That the Miniſtry of every true Miniſter of Chriſt, is a Miniſtration of Grace, of Spirit, of Life and Power, which doth emanate or flow forth from or through the Miniſter or Preacher, as living Waters that emanate and flow from a living <hi>spring</hi> or fountain, which reach and flow into the hearts and inward parts of the Hearers, ſuch as are ſenſible, and whoſe hearts God is pleaſed to open to receive them, and ſometimes to the opening
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:55597:29"/>
and making alive the dead ſouls and hearts of many hearers, whereby not only many that are ſpiritually dead, are made alive, but the living are made more living, and livingly refreſhed and ſtrengthened; and though this can hardly, or not at all be received by many, yet thouſands can witneſs it from living experience, that they have felt ſtreams of divine Life, Power and Vertue to ſpring and flow forth, from the Spirit of Chriſt, in faithful Preachers, into their ſouls and inward parts, to their exceeding refreſhing, and ſtrengthning in the inward Man; and the Scriptures abundantly confirm it, that ſo it was in the primitive times, the Miniſters of Chriſt, were the Miniſters of the Spirit and Power of God, and the outward and audible Words that reached the outward Ears, were only as a Conduit of Conveyance, to convey and tranſmit that heavenly Virtue that flowed through them; and therefore the Miniſters of God are called in Scripture <hi>flames of Fire,</hi> and their Words and Preaching have a divine and ſpiritual Fire, and Heat in them, that exceedingly warm and melt the cold and congealed Hearts of many Hearers, and that Fire is a living Fire, or Power of Life to quicken them. And this was it that made the two Diſciples, going to <hi>Emaus,</hi> ſay, <hi>How did not our Hearts burn within us, while he spoke to us by the way, and opened the Scriptures unto us</hi>? And when Chriſt preached to the People, it is ſaid, <hi>he spoke with Authority,</hi> that is, Power, and not as the <hi>Scribes</hi>; and ſo did the Apoſtles, as <hi>Paul</hi>
                  <pb n="49" facs="tcp:55597:29"/>
declared, <hi>That his Preaching was in Demonſtration of the Spirit, and of Power.</hi> And Chriſt and the holy Spirit ſpake in him to the People, when he preached; and ſo did it in all the other A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles and Miniſters of Chriſt, and the Hearers, who had and knew Chriſt in their own hearts, had a Proof ſufficient that Chriſt ſpoke in <hi>Paul,</hi> by what they felt of that ſpiritual Vertue and Power that did flow forth through him in his Miniſtry. And according to this, <hi>Peter</hi> exhorted, <hi>That he who miniſters, ſhould miniſter of the Power that God giveth, as good Stewards of the manifold Grace of God</hi>: So they miniſtred not only Words, but Grace, and Power, and Life to the hearers. And thus there is a communication of the Grace, and Graces of God, not only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt Miniſters and Hearers, but among all the Faithful, who are as one living Body, but many Members, and every Member a living Member, and miniſtring Life one to another, as it is in the natural Body; and this is that <hi>Communion of the Saints</hi> that the Scripture teſtifieth, that they had together in the Spirit, which did knit their Hearts together in Love, unto all Riches of the full aſſurance of Underſtanding, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.2. And with ſuch living inſtruments, that are ſpiritual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made alive unto God, doth God work, to make their Miniſtry effectual and fruitful, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert and beget Souls unto God, and when be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten, to nouriſh and feed them with the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere Milk of the Word, which Milk is not the outward Words, but the Life that is in the
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:55597:30"/>
Words: For as in the outward, God doth not work with a dead Man, to beget outward and natural Children, but with the living; ſo it is with Men ſpiritually living, with whom God worketh, to beget Sons and Daughters ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally unto God, where God only properly and principally is the Father, and Men but Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments with, and by whom he worketh; and in order to this ſpiritual begetting of Sons and Daughters unto God, by the Miniſtry of faithful Preachers, God giveth unto them a ſpiritual and divine Seed, which they convey in their words into the Hearts and Souls of their Hearers, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.10. <hi>He that ministreth Seed to the Sower.</hi> And <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.10. <hi>That it may give Seed to the Sower.</hi> So that there is a divine and ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Seed in the Words and Preaching of a true Miniſter of Chriſt; for the words are living Words, and are not his, but the words of Chriſt, and of the holy Spirit that ſpeaketh in him. But he that ſpeaketh Words, as ſuppoſe Scripture-words, and not by the Spirit of Chriſt ſpeaking in him, there is no divine Seed in the Words, there is the form or body of the Words, but there is no Soul or Life in them, as he ſpeaks them. And theſe Men are like that Harlot which took hold of <hi>Joſephs garment,</hi> but himſelf ſhe could not enjoy: So many get the outward form of the <hi>words of Truth,</hi> but the Spirit of Truth they have not, and who have it not, cannot miniſter it: And therefore <hi>Paul</hi> imputeth all the good Fruit and Succeſs of his Miniſtry not to himſelf, but to the
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:55597:30"/>
Grace of God that was with him, and in him, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.10. How then can a graceleſs Man have any fruit or ſucceſs in his Miniſtry, ſeeing all fruit and ſucceſs belongeth not to the Man, however ſo well furniſhed with natural or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired parts, but to the Grace of God? It is <hi>Grace, Grace,</hi> that maketh a Man's Preaching ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual to the Hearers, and that Grace is in the Miniſter, and worketh both in him, and with him in the Hearts of the Hearers, where God is pleaſed to concur, and give the bleſſing and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe; and thus the Grace of God is like a good Seed and Plant, that not only bringeth forth Fruit in that little ſpot of Earth, where it was firſt planted, but ſpreadeth abroad, and filleth many other parts and places with it, and hath new Roots and Seeds continually encreaſing and multiplying.</p>
               <p n="7">7. And as concerning the <hi>Call to the Miniſtry,</hi> It is worthy of great obſervation, how they are pinched and narrowed to give any colou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable account of their <hi>Call,</hi> who deny all inward and immediate <hi>calling to the Ministry,</hi> and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially ſuch of them, who ſay, <hi>The Church of</hi> Rome <hi>is no true Church, but a Harlot, and the Pope is Antichrist</hi>; as the <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> Cenfeſſion of Faith doth expreſly call him, <hi>cap.</hi> 25. <hi>ſect.</hi> 6. and yet the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Miniſters generally derive their Call from him; and I have heard divers of them expreſly affirm it, being queſtioned about their Call, whether <hi>immediate</hi> or <hi>mediate</hi>? they have anſwered <hi>mediate,</hi> from the Apoſtles;
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:55597:31"/>
and then being urged to ſhew the Line of Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion, through which that <hi>mediate Call</hi> is convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto them, they have plainly ſaid, <hi>The Popes of Rome,</hi> as one lately, a Preacher in <hi>New-England</hi> ſaid, before ſome Hundreds of People, <hi>That their Call to Preach, was by the Popes of Rome</hi>; and ſo according to their own Doctrin, by Antichriſt. Surely theſe men do not believe that Chriſt is in them, either to call, or furniſh them in their Miniſtry, who muſt go ſo far as <hi>Rome</hi> to bring it, and from him too whom they call Antichriſt. But they think <hi>Rome,</hi> and the <hi>Pope</hi> however much diſtant from them, is much nearer than Chriſt and Heaven, from whom the true Miniſters have their Call.</p>
               <p n="8">8. And as all true Preaching ought to be by the Inſpiration and moving of the Spirit of God, ſo all true <hi>Praying</hi> and <hi>Singing,</hi> both in private and in publick; for ſtill that is it which the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture enjoyneth, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6.18. to <hi>Pray always with the Spirit,</hi> or <hi>in the Spirit</hi>; and no man can ſay that Jeſus is the Lord, either in Preaching or Praying, but by the holy Ghoſt. And I charge them to produce one Inſtance, where Praying without the Spirit is commanded any where in Scripture, or was ever practiſed by any of the Saints, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Inſpiration of the Spirit. Do they not grant, that all the Prayers recorded in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, did proceed from divine Inſpiration and Revelation? And if their Prayers do not, they are quite of a Baſtard kind; for the true Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippers Worſhip the Father in Spirit and in
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:55597:31"/>
Truth, and the Father ſeeketh ſuch to Worſhip him, and none elſe. And whereas ſome ſay, <hi>Then men who neglect Prayer, are excuſable, becauſe they have not the Spirit to move them to Prayer.</hi> I anſwer; Not, they are not in the leaſt excuſable, for as he that oweth a ſum of Mony to his Prince, though he hath not wherewith to pay his Debt, is ſtill Debtor, and yet muſt not pay with falſe Coyn, but true; ſo he, who hath not the Spirit's aſſiſtance and help to Pray, is ſtill obliged to Pray, but not without the Spirit; and that he hath not the Spirit's help at all ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable and requiſite times for Prayer, it is his own default, who hath reſiſted the Spirit, and provoked him to with-draw his neceſſary aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance from him; for the Spirit of the Lord is ready to give his ſeaſonable help to all men, to help them both in Prayer, and Thanksgiving, and all other commanded Duties and Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances. And as for <hi>Singing on a Book,</hi> and with <hi>artificial Muſick,</hi> and <hi>notes</hi> or <hi>tones,</hi> it is no part of Goſpel-worſhip, being no where either com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, or practiſed in the New-Teſtament. And it is ſtrange, that theſe men ſhould be againſt Praying on a Book, and yet Sing on a Book, for if the one be not Spiritual, the other is not.</p>
               <p n="9">9. There are others, ſuch as theſe called <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependents</hi> and <hi>Baptiſts,</hi> who deny all immediate Call to the Miniſtry, and yet betake themſelves to as poor and ſhiftleſs evaſion about their Call, as the former. They ſay, <hi>They have the Call of
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:55597:32"/>
the Church.</hi> But ſtill the queſtion is, Whence had the Church her Power, either <hi>immediately</hi> or <hi>mediately?</hi> And then the former difficulty re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turneth: for they cannot ſay, their Church hath been viſible from the Apoſtles days; and beſides, the Church is poſterior to the Miniſtry, for by true Preachers and Miniſters, people come to be converted, and ſo to be made fit Members of a Church, and therefore the Miniſters, by whom their Church was firſt raiſed, or gathered, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not have their Call from the ſame, for that were to put the Effect before the Cauſe; or to ſay, the Church called the Miniſters, and the Miniſters called the Church, is to run into a Circle; as to ſay, the Egg bringeth forth the Hen, and the Hen bringeth for the Egg, to wit, firſt of all, which is impoſſible.</p>
               <p n="10">10. And as concerning <hi>true Goſpel-Mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance to the Miniſtry</hi>; any Maintenance that may be neceſſary, to any that are poor, and have not of their own, according to the Scripture, it ought to be free and voluntary, without force of human Law and compulſion; for the Scripture ſaith, <hi>He that Preacheth the Goſpel, ſhould Live by the Goſpel.</hi> It doth not ſay, by human Laws, and ſtraining of mens Goods and Cattle, as the Preachers both of Old and <hi>New-England</hi> have done; and they ought to relie upon the gracious Care and Providence of God, that never ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Miniſters to want: for when Chriſt ſent forth his Diſciples without Bag or Scrip, at their return they ſaid, <hi>they wanted nothing.</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:55597:32"/>
there ſhould be no bargaining in the caſe betwixt the Miniſter and the People, for that is altogether mercenary, and proveth them to be Hirelings, and the Servants of Men, who have ſo hired them. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> they ſhould receive on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to ſupply their preſent Neceſſities, and labour with their Hands, as honeſt <hi>Paul</hi> did, that he might make the Goſpel of Chriſt without charge, who would not abuſe his Power in the Goſpel, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.18. and 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.9. <hi>I was chargeable to no Man.</hi> And 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.9. <hi>Becauſe we would not be chargeable,</hi> and 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3.8. For why may not Miniſters, when they do not Preach, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe labour in the miniſterial Work, work with their Hands to ſupply their Neceſſities, to live honeſtly and worthily, as many Preachers at this day (as well as formerly) do, both Work and Preach by turns, and as they have freely received, ſo they give freely; and theſe no Man can charge them, that they have made their <hi>Goſpel chargeable,</hi> as the Preachers both of Old and <hi>New-England</hi> have done, who have put the People to great charge of many Thouſand Pounds yearly, and yet the People is not profited under them; and they have by force taken, or cauſed to be taken, from many who did not hear them, nor own them to be Miniſters of Chriſt, for which they have no preſident either in the Old or New Teſtament.</p>
               <p n="11">11. And whereas they who plead, <hi>That true Piety is not eſſential to a Gospel-Miniſter</hi>: Firſt, bring <hi>Judas</hi> for a preſident, to which it is eaſily
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:55597:33"/>
anſwered; <hi>first,</hi> that it is ſaid, <hi>Judas fell from his Miniſtry by Tranſgreſſion,</hi> and therefore ſome time he ſtood; and it is more than ever they can prove, that <hi>Judas</hi> never had any meaſure of true Piety or Sanctification, when Chriſt did firſt ſend him forth; for although he might have covetous and evil Inclinations, that doth not argue that he had nothing of true Sanctification, according to their own Doctrin, who affirm, <hi>That a Man may have true Sanctification, and yet have not only ſtrong evil Inclinations, but very evil Practices.</hi> But 2<hi>dly,</hi> when <hi>Judas</hi> was called, the pure Goſpel diſpenſation had not taken place, and did not until Chriſt roſe from the Dead, and gave the holy Ghoſt. Next they ſay, <hi>Chriſt told the People, that the</hi> Phariſees <hi>ſate in</hi> Moſes <hi>Chair, and he did not forbid them, but rather encouraged them to hear them, ſaying, Do what they ſay, but do not as they do.</hi> To this it is anſwered, The <hi>Phariſees</hi> and <hi>Scribes</hi> teaching belonged to the Law; and ſo they paſs from the true ſtate of the Queſtion, which is, whether Miniſters of the Goſpel need not true Holineſs to make them true Miniſters? 3<hi>dly.</hi> They object <hi>Paul</hi>'s words con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning ſome that preached Chriſt not ſincerely, and yet he ſaid, Chriſt was preached, and therein he rejoyced. To which I anſwer, that doth not juſtifie their Preaching, but it holdeth forth the great Power and Wiſdom of God, that cauſeth all things to work together for his own Glory, and the good of his, as when by Perſecutions, and Reproaches, and Slanders, and falſe Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:55597:33"/>
and contending againſt the Truth, the Truth doth the more ſpread and flouriſh, as hath oft been known, and therein God's Servants have rejoyced; yet this doth not juſtifie theſe Perſecutors, Lyers, and falſe Accuſers.</p>

                  <pb n="58" facs="tcp:55597:34"/>
to cauſe to be put to Death three dear and precious Men-Servants of the Lord, and one dear and precious Maid-Servant of the Lord, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide many other cruel Sufferings inflicted upon others, for which great Cruelty and Barbarity, the Hand of the Lord hath been manifeſtly ſtretched out againſt them, in manifeſt Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Plagues, that divers among them have ſince acknowledged. And therefore let all Men know, to whoſe Hands this may come, that the People called <hi>Quakers,</hi> never denyed, but on the contrary, faithfully believed, and do ſtill faithfully believe whatever is recorded in the holy Scriptures, of that great Myſtery, to wit, that God is one, and that the Father, the Son, and the holy Ghoſt is that one only, true and living God, the Creator and Upholder of all, and Lord and King of all viſible and inviſible things, and that the Father is begotten of none, the Son is begotten of the Father, from everlaſting, and before all Time; and the holy Ghoſt hath proceeded from the Father, and from the Son, from Everlaſting, and before all Time; and that the Son is God manifeſt in Fleſh, who came in the Fleſh, in the fulneſs of time, as the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture declareth; and that the Lord Jeſus Chriſt whom the Apoſtles preached, that dyed for our Sins, and roſe again for our Juſtification, and is aſcended and gone into Heaven, is that alone Son of God, and the only begotten of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in whom the fulneſs of the God-head dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth bodily, and the Lord Jeſus Chriſt in the
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:55597:34"/>
intire and perfect nature of Man, conſiſting of Soul and Body, is gone into Heaven, and is in Heaven; and that his Body that was crucified, and buried, did not ſee Corruption, but was raiſed on the third day, and after forty days did aſcend, and was glorified, according to which glorious Body of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, we believe that at the Reſurrection of the Dead our Bodies ſhall be changed, and be made like, or conform. <hi>Acts</hi> 1.11. and that the ſame Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, who is aſcended, and was taken up into Heaven, ſhall ſo come in like manner as they did ſee him go into Heaven.</p>

indeed it ſuits moſt with their Doctrin, that all inward divine Revelation is ceaſed, either to conceal, or deny that God is Light, as to us, and in us, or in any of his Saints, or that Chriſt is Light to and in his Saints; for the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Light, yea, of all true Light, is to reveal, and make it ſelf manifeſt by it ſelf, as well as other things; and this deſcription the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> giveth of it, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.13. <hi>What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever maketh manifest, is Light,</hi> according to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Tranſlation; or as it may be as well tranſlated, the Light is that which maketh ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt every thing, to wit, both it ſelf, and all other things: And this deſcription of <hi>Light</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth only to God and Chriſt, and the holy Spirit, in the full extent of it; for no created Light, viſible or inviſible, can manifeſt or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal all things, the outward Light of the Sun can only manifeſt ſome outward things, but not all, it cannot let us ſee what is under the Earth, or in the bottom of the Seas, but God can, and doth ſearch all Deeps, and can reveal or make manifeſt every thing, however ſo hid; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Name <hi>Light</hi> doth more properly belong to God, the Father of Lights, and to Chriſt, and to the holy Ghoſt, than to any created Light, viſible or inviſible; and yet a publick Preacher in <hi>New-England,</hi> in the Town of <hi>Hampton,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſome Hundreds of People, moſt of them his common Hearers, did affirm, <hi>That God was not properly Light, but only by a Figure borrowed from the outward Light of the Sun: And to ſay, God
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:55597:35"/>
was Light, and Chriſt was Light, was the funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Error of the</hi> Quakers. And though ſome of his Brethren have blamed his Raſhneſs, yet it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be denyed, but he ſaid that which was moſt conſequential and agreeable to his Brethren's Doctrin, and the <hi>Weſtminſter Confeſſion of Faith,</hi> which the Church of <hi>New-England</hi> hath eſpou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to be her Confeſſion of Faith alſo; for if God do not at all reveal himſelf immediately, or any other things, he is not Light at all unto his Saints now on Earth; as we may well ſay, if the outward Sun ſhould with-draw his Beams alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether from the Eyes of Men, or that ſome dark body ſhould be interpoſed always betwixt the Sun's Light and Men's Eyes, the Sun ſhould not be Light unto Men; for it is the nature and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of all Light, to reveal it ſelf immediately to every one, or elſe not at all, and always to be its own Meſſenger, and to diſcover, teach and direct Men by its own Light and Evidence, and not by any other thing. For to ſay, the Sun doth not lighten us immediately, when it giveth us its Illumination, is a great Contradiction that the Aſſertion carrieth to it ſelf; for what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever means or mediums the Sun's light paſſeth through to our Eyes, as the Air, Glaſs, and the Tunicles of our Eyes, or ſuppoſe ſome Lattiſe or thin vail, or cloathing, yet its ſtill immediate; or if it be reflected from a Looking-glaſs, or any other Object, yet the Light it ſelf coming to our ſight through all theſe means, or mediums, and not ſtopping or ſtaying by the way, nor em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploying
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:55597:36"/>
ſome other Meſſenger in its room, to carry the tydings of it to us, it is ſtill immediate, &amp; the Light hath a ſelf-evidence, whereby to make it ſelf known, without any other help or inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, whereby to make it known. And thus God is Light, and thus not only the Saints knew God to be Light, but alſo divers of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> who had not the Scriptures, knew <hi>God to be Light</hi>; as <hi>Plo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinus,</hi> who ſaid, <hi>As we ſee &amp; know the Sun by his own Light: ſo we ſee and know God by his own Light:</hi> And <hi>Pythagoras</hi> and <hi>Plato declared God to be Light</hi>; and it was one of <hi>Pythagora</hi>'s rules, <hi>Let none pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume to speak or teach of God, without his Light,</hi> wherein he ſaw further and better into the true Myſtery of Preaching and Teaching, than theſe blind Faith makers at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> and <hi>New-England</hi> Preachers, who have eſpouſed that blind and dark thing called their <hi>Confeſſion of Faith.</hi> And <hi>Plato</hi> taught, <hi>That God created the Soul of Man in a Region of divine Light, and then it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſed with the true ſubſtance of Light, and of every other thing; but by its Sin, it was thruſt down into a Cave, or Dungeon, where it only converſed with Shadows and Figures, or Images of things, which are the things of this outward and periſhing World.</hi> And this doth well agree with the Scripture, that ſaith, <hi>God drove out the Man from the Garden</hi>: And thus the mind of Man loſing the inward en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of God, the true Light, did joyn it ſelf to the periſhing things of this World, where it can find no true Reſt, for they are but Figures and Shadows; and the Scripture calleth this
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:55597:36"/>
World a Faſhion or Figure, and Scheme, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.31. And why is Chriſt called <hi>the true Light,</hi> and <hi>the true Bread</hi> in Scripture, and <hi>the Truth,</hi> but to ſignifie unto us, that he is indeed more truly and properly, and ſatisfyingly the Soul's true Light and Food, than the outward Light and Bread is unto the Body, or outward Man? And therefore in compariſon of God, all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted things of Heaven and Earth, are ſaid to be <hi>nothing,</hi> and <hi>less than nothing,</hi> and the <hi>Nations are as nothing,</hi> and <hi>less than nothing before him,</hi> Iſa. 40.17. And therefore as the Name <hi>Being,</hi> and <hi>Good</hi> doth moſt properly belong to him, as Chriſt ſaid, <hi>There is none good, but God</hi> So the names <hi>Light, Life</hi> and <hi>Love,</hi> do moſt properly belong to him, though it is moſt readily granted, that he doth infinitely ſurpaſs and excel all that Men can either ſpeak, or think of him, and that he hath a Name that none knoweth, but he himſelf; but ſince it hath pleaſed God to call himſelf by the Name <hi>Light,</hi> ſpeaking unto Men in the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of the Sons of Men; I ſay, in the language of Men, the Name <hi>Light</hi> doth moſt properly, and without all Figure, belong to God and Chriſt, and this the Saints in Light well knew; but they who know not the Light, and believe not in it, it is no wonder that they think that God or Chriſt is Light only by a Figure or Metaphor, from the outward Light: For indeed the <hi>Animal</hi> or natural Man, that only followeth his natural Thoughts and Apprehenſions, doth not know God, but by Figures and Shadows: And though
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:55597:37"/>
I plead for the <hi>immediate Revelation</hi> of God and Chriſt in the Hearts and Spirits of his Saints, who is their Light and Life, yet the means are owned and acknowledged in their place, as good Men are Means, good Books, and eſpecially the Scriptures are means whereby to tranſmit the Light of God and Chriſt unto us, as he is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to make uſe of them, and not otherwiſe; even as the Air, or Glaſs of the Window, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not convey any light of the Sun unto us but when the Sun ſhineth; for when the Sun with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draweth, and hideth his Face, the Air and the Glaſs hath no Light to convey unto us: And thus it is as to all Men, and Books, and Means, they can convey no Light to us, but what, how, and when <hi>God,</hi> the <hi>Father of Lights,</hi> is pleaſed to ſend forth through them unto us; and this <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> well knew, when he prayed, ſaying, <hi>O ſend, forth thy Light, and thy Truth, to lead me and guide me to thy holy Hill, and lift up the Light of thy Countenance upon us,</hi> Pſal. 43.3. Pſal. 4.6. And as it pleaſeth God often, to tranſmit the Beams of his divine Light, Life and Love into our Souls, through Means and Inſtruments, as good Men, and good Books, and eſpecially in reading or meditating in the Scriptures, and alſo good Angels, who are miniſtring Spirits, and do mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter to the Heirs of Salvation, ſo many times it pleaſeth him to bring them into a ſolitude, or ſolitary place, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 2.14. and there to ſpeak unto them, and reveal himſelf, to the unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſatisfaction of their Souls, without all
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:55597:37"/>
means whatſoever, ſave only that great, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways moſt neceſſary and deſirable Mean, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, in and through whom the Father doth always ſpeak, and reveal his Glory to his dear Children, even as Chriſt declared, ſaying, <hi>No Man knoweth the Father, but the Son, and he to whom the Son reveals him.</hi> For none of all the Prophets or Apoſtles did know, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with God, but as the Son did reveal him, who is that moſt lovely and aimable skreen, cloathing or vail, through which the Glory of the Father ſhineth forth into our Souls, meekly, and gently, and yet moſt ſweetly, according as every one is able to receive.</p>
               <p n="3">3. And they who deny all inward divine Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation of God in his Saints, ever ſince the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles days, and would wholly exclude the Saints from all inward enjoyment of God and Chriſt, in their own immediate Light, Glory and Brightneſs, may be juſtly charged with <hi>Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy</hi> againſt the great love and kindneſs of God to his People: And ſuch of the Prieſts of <hi>New-England,</hi> who have blaſphemouſly called the Light of God in his People, <hi>A ſtinking Vapour from Hell</hi>; and do blaſpheme againſt the Light of God and Chriſt in all Men, in a Day of Viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, that is given to lead and bring them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, <hi>a meer human and natural Light, corrupt and dark,</hi> as ſome of them have called it, and as they generally eſteem of it. And yet for this their <hi>Blaſphemy,</hi> we would not have the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate to hang them, or any way to puniſh them,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:55597:38"/>
but our deſire, and Prayer unto God is for them, if it be his good will, that ſuch of them, who have not out-lived the Day of Viſiation, may find Mercy to repent, and believe, and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the Truth they have ſo long gain-ſayed. And whereas theſe Faith-publiſhers at <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> in <hi>Old-England,</hi> and at <hi>Cambridge</hi> and <hi>Boſton</hi> in <hi>New-England,</hi> do ſay in their Confeſſion, <hi>cap.</hi> 26. <hi>ſect</hi> 3. <hi>This Communion which the Saints have with Chriſt, doth not make them in any wiſe partakers of the Subſtance of his God-head, and that to affirm it is impious, and blaſphemous.</hi> It deſerveth our ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious conſideration, and to examin where the Impiety and Blaſphemy lieth, whether at their door who deny it, or theirs who affirm it? Even <hi>that the Saints are partakers of the Subſtance of his God-head.</hi> And firſt, as to their Proof from Scripture, they cite <hi>Col.</hi> 1.18, 19. <hi>And he is the Head of the Body, the Church, who is the beginning, the firſt-born from the Dead, that in all things he might have the preheminence; for it pleaſed the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that in him ſhould all fulness dwell.</hi> But this place of Scripture ſaith not that the Saints are not partakers of the Subſtance of the God-head of Chriſt, but the contrary may be proved from this very place, which calleth him, <hi>the Head of the Body, the Church.</hi> For as it is the ſame Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of Life, that is in the Head, and in the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and every Member of it: So it is the ſame di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Life and Spirit, that is in Chriſt, the Head, and all his Members, and that Spirit is the holy Spirit, and that Life is the Word, and the Word
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:55597:38"/>
and the Spirit are one Subſtance and Being with God, as the ſame Confeſſion ſaith, <hi>cap.</hi> 2. <hi>ſect.</hi> 3. And that the Saints are partakers of the divine Nature, and of the holy Ghoſt, the Scripture expreſly declareth it, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.4. and <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.4. So that it is marvelous blindneſs, or inadver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency in theſe Men, ſo to contradict the expreſs Scripture teſtimony: And for the Word <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,</hi> with reſpect to the inward enjoyment of God and Chriſt, the Scripture hath it expreſly in ſeveral places, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.21. <hi>That I may cauſe thoſe that love me to inherit Subſtance; and I will fill their Treaſures.</hi> And <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.34. <hi>Knowing that in your ſelves</hi> (for ſo the <hi>Greek</hi> doth bear it) <hi>ye have in Heaven a better, and more enduring Subſtance.</hi> For as they had it in Heaven, ſo they had an earneſt of it on Earth, in their Hearts; and that all fulneſs dwelleth in Chriſt, doth not prove that his Saints enjoy none of that fulneſs, but on the contrary. <hi>Out of her Fulness,</hi> as ſaid <hi>John, we have all received, and Grace for Grace,</hi> John 1.16. And not only the Saints receive Gifts and Graces from Chriſt, but they receive him, and the Father in him, and with him, to live and dwell in them, according to <hi>John</hi> 17.23. <hi>I in them, and thou in me.</hi> And yet this doth not infer that the Saints are equal with Chriſt, that they have the ſame Spirit and Life with him, and through him, and by and from him, as it doth not prove that the Foot is equal with the Head, becauſe the ſame Soul or Spirit that is in the Head, is in the Foot; and
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:55597:39"/>
the ſame Life that is in the Root of a Tree, is in the Branches; and as Chriſt ſaid, <hi>I am the Vine, ye are the Branches.</hi> And if the Saints do no wiſe partake of the Subſtance of the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head of Chriſt, I ask them, what do they par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of him? Do they partake only of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of his Manhood without the Godhead, or of neither? If the firſt, then the Manhood of Chriſt, as they partake of it, is without the Godhead, which is Blaſphemy indeed; or if the ſecond, that is to ſay, the Saints do neither par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of the Subſtance of his Godhead, nor of the Subſtance of his Manhood, then they partake nothing of Chriſt at all ſubſtantially, according to their Doctrin. O miſerable Teachers! What then do they partake of him, if nothing <hi>Subſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially</hi>? Of his Accidents, as they commonly ſay, <hi>All Graces are nothing but Accidents.</hi> Then here is a new ſort of Doctrin of <hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> as theſe of <hi>Rome</hi> ſay, <hi>The conſecrated Wafer or Cake, hath the Accidents of Bread in it, as the colour, taste and ſmell of Bread, but nothing of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of Bread is there.</hi> So ſay theſe Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>makers, <hi>The Saints that did ſee, ſmell, taſte and feel of Chriſt in ancient times, that which they did ſpiritually ſee, ſmell, taſte and feel with their Souls and Hearts, is only Accidents, and no Subſtance.</hi> This is more ſtrange than that other, that there is no Subſtance of Bread in the Cake, but only the Accidents. But why was not your reverend Brother, as ye called him, <hi>John Owen,</hi> taxed with Blaſphemy, for affirming, <hi>That the holy
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:55597:39"/>
Ghoſt doth well in Believers really</hi> (and as he worded it perſonally) <hi>together with his Graces.</hi> And <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel Rutherfold,</hi> a great <hi>Presbyterian,</hi> who ſaid in one of his Printed Epiſtles, <hi>He will have none of the Graces of Chriſt without himſelf, and if the Graces did come unto him without Chriſt, he would ſend them away the Gate (or way) they came.</hi> And as for the other Scriptures they cite, they prove in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed that the Lord Jeſus Chriſt is but one, and there is none elſe, nor is any man, or men, or An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels equal to him, which we moſt cordially be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve; but they ſay, not in the leaſt, nor by any juſt conſequence, can it be gathered, that the Saints do not partake ſubſtantially of God. And to ſhew the great inequality betwixt Chriſt and the Saints, not only in the meaſure and degree but in the manner or kind of partaking of the holy Spirit, which is one Subſtance with God. Chriſt, the Son, hath God, and the holy Spirit, without any middle, or mediator betw<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>t the Father and him, but the Saints only have, and enjoy the Father, and the holy Spirit, through Chriſt the Mediator, and together with him, and in him: And this I hope will ſatisfie all ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and impartial Men, to clear the Doctrin of the <hi>Quakers,</hi> that it is according to Scripture.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Next, as concerning the <hi>Decrees of God,</hi> theſe Faith-publiſhers ſay, <hi>That God hath un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeably ordained whatſoever comes to pass, yet ſo as neither is God the Author of Sin, nor is Violence offered to the will of the Creatures</hi>: Whereby it plainly appeareth, they hold that God hath or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:55597:40"/>
and decreed all manner of Sins and Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemies, Adulteries, Thefts, Robberies, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micides, Regicides, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which is abominable and blaſphemous Doctrin, with a witneſs. They need not blame the <hi>Ranters,</hi> ſeeing they are ſo fully one with them in Doctrin; for that is one of the worſt Doctrins that the Ranters have, <hi>That God doth all, and hath unchangeably ordained and decreed all things, both good and bad</hi>; for certainly whatever God hath ordained and decreed to come to paſs, he is the doer of it, for he executeth (that is, bringeth to paſs) all his own Decrees, as they confeſs in their large <hi>Catechiſm,</hi> Anſ. to Queſt. 14. and that they ſay, <hi>yet ſo, as God is not the Author of Sin</hi>; they ſay it indeed, and ſo many of the worſt ſort of <hi>Ranters,</hi> but how they clear their Doctrin of ſo unavoidable conſequence, they have not told the World, nor ever can they ſufficiently clear it. And for the Scriptures they bring, as eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.11. <hi>That God worketh all things after the counſel of his own Will</hi>; here is nothing mentioned of the ſins of Men and Devils: It is plain both from Reaſon, and Scripture, that by <hi>all things</hi> muſt needs be underſtood <hi>all his own Works,</hi> and not the Sins of Men and Devils, which he is not the Author of; as when we ſay, <hi>every wiſe Man doth all things by Wiſdom, and wiſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel</hi>; none is ſo fooliſh as to put this gloſs upon it. <hi>that he doth all fooliſh things.</hi> It is an approved Maxim and Rule, <hi>Verba ſunt intelligenda, ſecun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum ſubjectam materiam,</hi> i. e. Words are to be
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:55597:40"/>
underſtood according to the ſubject matter. It is worthily granted and acknowledged, that God worketh all good things, all <hi>Virtue</hi> and <hi>Goodness</hi> is of him, all <hi>good Thoughts, Words</hi> and <hi>Works, &amp;c.</hi> But all Sin is of the Devil, and evil Men; as <hi>John</hi> ſaid, <hi>Whoſoever committeth Sin, is of the Devil, and the Lust of the Fleſh, the Luſt of the Eye, and the Pride of Life, is all of the Devil, and not of the Father.</hi> And as Chriſt ſaid, <hi>The Devil when he speaketh a Lye, he speaketh of his own.</hi> It is alſo granted, that when any commit Sin, the power whereby they act, is of God; but when they Sin, they abuſe that Power; and alſo whatever Sin cometh to paſs, is not without God's permiſſion, and that is not a bare permiſſion, but a moſt holy and wiſe ordering, and bounding of it to his own Glory. And as to <hi>Acts</hi> 2.23. a main place, that <hi>Ranters,</hi> and <hi>Presbyterian</hi> and <hi>Independent</hi> Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers abuſe and wreſt, (as they do other Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, to their own Deſtruction, if they repent not) it giveth them no ſtrength at all. For it ſaith, <hi>Him</hi> (to wit, Chriſt) <hi>being delivered by the determinate Counſel and Fore-knowledg of God, ye have taken,</hi> &amp;c. So we ſee, that he was deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, or expoſed unto them by the determinate Counſel of God, but that they did kill him by the determinate Counſel of God, the Scripture ſaith not. For to <hi>deliver</hi> is one thing, and to <hi>ſlay</hi> is another. Our worthy Friends that were put to Death at <hi>Boſton</hi> in <hi>New-England,</hi> they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered up their Lives freely into the Hands of theſe Murtherers, and ſo did many of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:55597:41"/>
not accepting deliverance; and yet they did not kill themſelves, as theſe bloody Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors uſe to alledge. And that its ſaid, <hi>God hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth whom he will.</hi> His hardning, is not the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king their Hearts hard, with infuſing any evil Spirit into them, but that he juſtly with-draws his good Spirit from them, for great Sins for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly committed, and ſo leaveth them to harden their own Hearts. As it is ſaid, <hi>That</hi> Pharoah <hi>hardned his Heart.</hi> And thus do many ſober and judicious <hi>Protestants</hi> underſtand the Words.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Again, as concerning <hi>Election</hi> and <hi>Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation,</hi> firſt, as to the Election and Predeſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Saints unto eternal Glory, and Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, whatever the Scripture ſaith of it, or of any other Doctrin, we do readily believe and acknowledge it, as, That God hath choſen the Saints in Chriſt Jeſus before the foundation of the World, that they ſhould be holy and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blamable before him in Love, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.4. and <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.29. <hi>For whom he did fore-know, he alſo did predeſtinate, to be conform to the Image of his Son,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and whom he did predestinate, them he called, and whom he called, them he justified.</hi> And what Chriſt ſaid to the Diſciples, <hi>Ye have not choſen me, but I have choſen you, and appointed you, to bring forth fruit, and that your fruit ſhould remain, Joh.</hi> 15.16. and 1 <hi>John</hi> 4.10. <hi>Herein is Love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and ſent his Son to be the Propitiation for our ſins</hi>; and verſ. 19. <hi>We love him, becauſe he firſt loved us.</hi> A moſt ſweet and comfortable Teſtimony, as all the other.
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:55597:41"/>
But we no where find in all the Scripture, that God hath <hi>Reprobated</hi> any part of Mankind, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the foundation of the World; nor is it ſaid, that Men hate God, becauſe he firſt hated them; and becauſe God hated them, he made them, on purpoſe to damn or deſtroy them, and decreed and ordained them to ſin, that he might take occaſion thereby to damn them. No ſuch thing at all is found in the holy Scriptures, nor can be gathered from them by any juſt conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence; for although it be allowed, that Gods purpoſe and holy Will concerning them that finally periſh, is from before the foundation of the World (for there is no new Will or Purpoſe in God, the Thoughts and Counſels of his heart being from everlaſting, as himſelf is) yet that Will of God regardeth and conſidereth them that ſhall finally periſh, not ſimply as men, nor yet ſimply as ſinners, either for <hi>Adam's</hi> ſin, or other ſins that they have formerly committed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that great <hi>ſin of final <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelief and Impenitency,</hi> but it doth regard and conſider them, as having a day of Viſitation, and a Call to Repent, and a tender of Grace, Love and Mercy from God the Father, and the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving reſiſted and rejected the ſame, and hardning their hearts againſt it, and that finally, until the Day of their Viſitation be over, whereby they declare themſelves unworthy of eternal Life, and that they are none of Chriſt's Sheep, but Goats, to be put at the left Hand; and if any ſay, <hi>If theſe Men were not Elected before the Foundation of
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:55597:42"/>
the World, it will follow that they were Reprobated before it.</hi> I anſwer; it doth not follow; for E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected and Reprobated are not contradictory terms, being both poſitive, and <hi>Election</hi> ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth a Preference of ſome before others, but that doth not argue a total <hi>Reprobation</hi> of others, when God did elect ſome. But at the End of the World, and in the Concluſion it is granted, that all who are not elected, are but Reprobates, to wit, when all God's elect Seed every where, are gathered out, ſelected and ſeparated from others, as ſo many Grains of pure Gold from all the Droſs, Tin and Lead that they have been ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with for a time, here in this World, that then nothing will remain but that which is Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate, and which the Scripture calleth <hi>repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate Silver,</hi> the pure being wholly ſeparated and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected from the impure, the Gold and Silver from the Droſs, the Wheat from the Tares, the Sheep from the Goats, and the good Fiſh from the bad, and the Children of the Kingdom, from the Children of the wicked One; he who hath Ears to hear, let him hear, and the wiſe in heart let them underſtand, for unto them it is given, but unto others, as Chriſt ſaid, in Parables, that ſeeing they may not ſee, and hearing that they may not hear, nor underſtand. And alſo it is readily granted, that there is a ſpecial and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar, and ſingularly gracious Care and Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God, towards all that ſhall be ſaved from the beginning of the world to the end, and the number of them is moſt infallibly known

unto God, and every one of that number ſhall certainly be ſaved, and none of them ſhall finally periſh, but in the proper ſeaſon and time ſhall be graciouſly <hi>viſited, called, converted, juſtified, ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified,</hi> and laſt of all <hi>glorified,</hi> and this without any Violence done to their rational Faculties or Free-will; for God doth well know how to gain and prevail upon the Underſtanding, and Will, and Inclinations of his People, by ſuch gentle, and yet prevalent and overcoming Perſwaſions and Allurements, and Motions of his holy Spirit of Grace, of Light and Life, as ſhall infallibly gather them unto himſelf. And it is alſo grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that as God hath provided that Grace, whereby ſome ſhall certainly be ſaved, ſo by the ſame all are put under a capacity or poſſibility of Salvation: And therefore that any are not ſaved in this World, is not becauſe of any want, or defect in the ſufficiency, or efficacy in the Grace in its own Nature; but becauſe of them, whom God in his infinite Juſtice and Counſel permits finally to reſiſt it, even as in the Parable of the Sower, the Seed was one and the ſame in all the four Grounds, but the Grounds differed one from another, and that one Ground was good, was of God, but that others were bad, was of themſelves; and the word <hi>Election</hi> doth proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enough ſignifie, <hi>ſelection, ſeperating</hi> and <hi>ſetting a part</hi> or <hi>refining,</hi> as when Gold or Silver is ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated in the Furnace from the Droſs. And this ſeparation hath had its various degrees and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, from firſt to laſt, as when Gold or Silver
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:55597:43"/>
is purified or purged in the ſire ſeven times, and then in the ſeventh time, it hath no mixture, but is all pure, or as when Liquor is poured from Veſſel to Veſſel ſeveral times, or as Wheat is winnowed again and again, until all the Chaff be ſeparated. And in this ſenſe we find the word <hi>Election</hi> uſed in Scripture divers times. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 14.1. <hi>For the Lord will have mercy on</hi> Jacob, <hi>and will yet chuſe</hi> Iſrael. And <hi>Iſa.</hi> 49.7. <hi>And he ſhall chuſe thee.</hi> And <hi>Zach.</hi> 1.17. <hi>And the Lord ſhall yet comfort</hi> Zion, <hi>and ſhall yet chuſe</hi> Jeruſalem. And Zach. 2.12. <hi>He ſhall chuſe</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>again.</hi> And Iſa. 48.10. <hi>I have choſen thee in the Furnace of Affliction.</hi> And in this ſenſe of the Word, as it ſignifieth a ſelecting or ſeparating the pure from the impure, <hi>Election</hi> doth go before <hi>Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation,</hi> and is not Co-evous with it. But whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that <hi>Election</hi> in Chriſt before the Foundation of the world, doth in ſome ſort ſignifie a <hi>ſelection</hi> or <hi>ſetting apart</hi> in <hi>Chriſt</hi> the Head, who was before the Foundation of the world, and is ſaid to <hi>be the Lamb ſlain from the Foundation of the World,</hi> as ſome myſtick Writers affirm, it is not my preſent buſineſs to determine, neither is it neceſſary at this preſent occaſion.</p>
               <p n="6">6. But the place of Scripture which they main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly abuſe and wreſt, to prove this reprobate Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin of theirs, of an abſolute Reprobation of the greateſt part of mankind, even before they are born, and that not only Babes and Sucklings on the Mothers Breaſts, but in the Womb are abſolute Reprobates and caſt-aways, and that
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:55597:43"/>
ſome, yea, many <hi>Infants die in a state of Reproba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and periſh eternally</hi> (only for <hi>Adams</hi> ſin im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted unto them (as they ſay, without any knowledge or eonſent of theirs) and corrupt Nature derived into them) and that all ſuch Reprobates never had, or ever ſhall have any opportunity of ſaving Grace, whereby it was poſſible to them at any time to be ſaved. The place of Scripture, I ſay, they mainly abuſe and wreſt, to favour this evil and pernicious Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin, is that in <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.11, 12, 13. But for the opening and vindicating of this place of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, let it be conſidered, that here is only a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference mentioned of <hi>Jacob</hi> before <hi>Eſau,</hi> how that the Elder ſhall ſerve the Younger, but this ſaith nothing of <hi>Eſau</hi> his being abſolutely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probated. The great deſign of the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> being to ſhew that God had choſen the Line of <hi>Jacob</hi> before the Line of <hi>Eſau,</hi> and given unto that Line and Poſterity of <hi>Jacob,</hi> a Preference and Dignity over the Line and Poſterity of <hi>Eſau,</hi> and that the reaſon of this Preference was not any Works that they had done, but for ſome other cauſe hid in the ſecret counſel of God; and this Preference did appear, firſt, in chuſing the Line and Poſterity of <hi>Jacob,</hi> to be his Church in that peculiar Diſpenſation of the <hi>Moſaical Law,</hi> and giving them many Prophets, and other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Men, to be raiſed up among them, and honouring them with many great and ſignal Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances, Signs and Wonders; whereas the Poſterity of <hi>Eſau</hi> was not ſo highly favoured, and
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:55597:44"/>
yet they had a divine Diſpenſation among them, which did ſuffice unto that preſent time and ſtate. Secondly, in that God did chuſe the Line of <hi>Jacob,</hi> and his Poſterity, out of whom Chriſt ſhould be born after the Fleſh, and alſo the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, and that out of <hi>Jacob</hi> the Goſpel ſhould go forth and be preached to all the World. 3dly. That the Nation that ſhould come of <hi>Eſau</hi> ſhould really become Servants, and Tributaries to the Nation of <hi>Iſrael</hi>; and this was fulfilled in <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>'s time, and was alſo a Figure of another thing to be ſpiritually fulfilled. And therefore this <hi>Election</hi> doth not infer any <hi>Reprobation</hi> of <hi>Eſau,</hi> or his Poſterity, as to their eternal eſtate, no more than when <hi>David</hi> ſaid, 1 Chron. 28.4, 5. <hi>The Lord God of</hi> Iſrael <hi>choſe me before all the houſe of my Father, for he hath choſen</hi> Judah <hi>to be the Ruler, and of the houſe of</hi> Judah, <hi>the Houſe of my Father, and of the Sons of my Father, he liked me to make me King over all</hi> Iſrael; <hi>and of all my Sons, he hath choſen</hi> Solomon <hi>my Son.</hi> So here are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Elections; firſt, <hi>Judah</hi> out of all the Tribes; ſecondly, the Family of <hi>Jeſſe,</hi> out of the Tribe of <hi>Judah</hi>; thirdly, <hi>David</hi> out of all the Sons of <hi>Jeſſe</hi>; and fourthly, <hi>Solomon</hi> out of all the Sons of <hi>David,</hi> and yet no abſolute Reprobation of any that were not ſo choſen, as to their eternal ſtate. And becauſe many of the People of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were proud, becauſe of this choice and prefe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence that God made of their Nation, above the Nation of <hi>Eſau,</hi> ſo as to make them a Church to himſelf, when the Nation of <hi>Eſau</hi> was not ſo
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:55597:44"/>
favoured, for Reaſons beſt known unto God, and for that cauſe did conclude, that they were always to remain a People ſingularly favoured of him above all other People, from firſt to laſt. To beat down this vain Conceit of theirs, <hi>Paul</hi> telleth them, <hi>firſt,</hi> that they are not all <hi>Iſrael,</hi> which are of <hi>Iſrael. Secondly,</hi> that as God did prefer, and make choice of the Nation of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> to be a gathered People and Church unto him, before the Nation of <hi>Eſau,</hi> and that without any regard to their Works, or to the Works of their Fathers, but for ſome other hid Cauſe and Reaſon in the depth of Gods ſecret Counſel; ſo God could as freely, yea, and would prefer the poor <hi>Gentiles,</hi> who were no People, to be a Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple unto him, and a Goſpel-Church, to become true Believers in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, when in the mean time the bulk and body of the Nation of <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſhould be rejected, and caſt off, at leaſt for ſome time, from having any ſuch dignity and favour (a Remnant only being reſerved, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Election of Grace, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.5.) and this <hi>Paul</hi> proveth at large, from Verſe 25. of that 9th. Chapter, to Verſe 33. and doth fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther proſecute it in the two following Chapters. Verſe 25. &amp;c. <hi>As he ſaith alſo in</hi> O ſee, <hi>I will call them my People, which are not my People, and her beloved, which was not beloved.</hi> And verſe 30. <hi>What ſhall we ſay then? that the</hi> Gentiles <hi>which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed not after Righteouſness, have attained to Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſness, even the Righteouſness of Faith; but</hi> Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael, <hi>which followed after the Law of Righteouſness,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:55597:45"/>
hath not attained to the Law of Righteouſness, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they ſought it not by Faith,</hi> &amp;c. So, we ſee how <hi>Paul</hi> maketh the Parallel, that as God once preferred, or chuſed <hi>Jacob</hi>'s Nation, before the Nation of <hi>Eſau,</hi> ſo again he preferred and chuſed the <hi>Gentiles</hi> (that had no good Works to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend them, and to move God to make that choice) out of his free Mercy, before the People of <hi>Iſrael</hi>; and of theſe <hi>Gentiles,</hi> no doubt, many of them did belong to the Poſterity of <hi>Eſau,</hi> and alſo of <hi>Iſhmael,</hi> yea, of <hi>Cain</hi>; for there is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs Promiſe made to the Remnant of <hi>Edom,</hi> and of all the <hi>Heathen,</hi> upon whom his Name is or ſhall be called, Amos 9.12. <hi>And it is but a Remnant alſo of</hi> Iſrael <hi>that is ſaved, until the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the</hi> Gentiles <hi>come in, and then all</hi> Iſrael (to wit, the true <hi>Iſrael,</hi> which is not all who are of <hi>Iſrael</hi> after the Fleſh) <hi>ſhall be ſaved</hi>; ſee Rom. 9.27. and 11.5.25, 26. And laſtly, it is to be again conſidered, that what God ſpoke unto <hi>Rebecca,</hi> before the Children were born, not having done Good or Evil, did not ſo much regard the ſingular Perſons of <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Eſau,</hi> as their Poſterities, as is clear from Gen. 25.23. <hi>And the Lord ſaid unto her, Two Nations are in thy Womb, and two manner of People ſhall be ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from thy Bowels; and the one People ſhall be ſtronger than the other People, and the Elder ſhall ſerve the Younger.</hi> So we ſee here, the words are ſaid of the Nations of <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Eſau,</hi> and not the Perſons of them; for we read not any where that ever <hi>Eſau</hi> in Perſon ſerved <hi>Jacob,</hi> but only
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:55597:45"/>
in his Poſterity, as was fulfilled in <hi>David</hi>'s time, when the <hi>Edomites</hi> became Tributaries to the People of <hi>Iſrael</hi>: Nor was it ſaid before the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren were born, <hi>Jacob have I loved,</hi> and Eſau <hi>have I hated,</hi> as it is commonly alledged, but many hundred Years after he was deceaſed. And if it had been ſo ſaid, it could not prove an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute rejection either of <hi>Eſau,</hi> or his Poſterity, as to their eternal ſtate; for God is ſaid in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to hate all evil-Doers, and yet many Evil-doers repent, and obtain Salvation, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Hatred doth not ſignifie abſolute and final hatred, either in God or Men: For it is ſaid, <hi>Jacob loved</hi> Rachel, <hi>and hated</hi> Leah; that is, he loved <hi>Rachel</hi> more: And Chriſt ſaid, <hi>He that hateth not Father, and Mother for my cauſe, is not worthy of me</hi>; that is, he that loveth me not more than Father and Mother. And therefore to conclude, this whole paſſage in <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.11, 12. doth not prove the abſolute Reprobation of either <hi>Eſau,</hi> or of his Poſterity, becauſe many of <hi>Eſau</hi>'s poſterity had a Promiſe of Salvation, as is already proved from <hi>Amos</hi> 9. And if <hi>Eſau</hi> had been an abſolute Reprobate, the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture would never have ſaid, <hi>that</hi> Iſaac <hi>by Faith bleſſed</hi> Jacob <hi>and</hi> Eſau <hi>concerning things to come,</hi> Heb. 9.20. And that Faith was the Subſtance of things hoped for, and had a regard to the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Bleſſing of <hi>Eſau,</hi> and of his Poſterity; for though <hi>Jacob</hi> got the firſt Bleſſing, yet <hi>Eſau</hi> got the ſecond, and their two Bleſſings did not dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer in Subſtance, but in ſome weighty Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:55597:46"/>
of order and time; and <hi>Iſaac</hi> propheſied in <hi>Eſau</hi>'s Bleſſing, that he ſhould have the fat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Earth, and dew of Heaven (the ſame but the order inverted with <hi>Jacob's</hi> bleſſing) and that in proceſs of time he ſhould be a free Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, to wit, in Goſpel days, ſignified by theſe words, <hi>Gen.</hi> 27.40. <hi>And it ſhall come to pass, when thou ſhalt have Dominion,</hi> to wit, in Chriſt, in Goſpel days, <hi>in thy Poſterity, that thou ſhalt break his Yoke from off thy Neck.</hi> And ſo we find that divers (<hi>Mark</hi> 3.8.) <hi>Idumeans,</hi> that were of <hi>Eſau,</hi> followed Jeſus; and <hi>Jacob</hi>'s putting on <hi>Eſau</hi>'s goodly Rayment, ſignified how in Goſpel days, the true Believers of <hi>Jacob,</hi> and <hi>Eſau,</hi> ſhould become one Body of a Goſpel-Church, and in this Body they of <hi>Eſau</hi> ſhould be as Hands, but the Voice is <hi>Jacob</hi>'s, that is, the Word of God, in the preaching of the Goſpel, ſhould be ſounded out of <hi>Jacob</hi>'s Line, to wit, from the Prophets and Apoſtles, who were of <hi>Jacob.</hi> And there is no ground from Scripture, that <hi>Eſau,</hi> as to his Perſon, was not ſaved; yea, <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> and <hi>Moller,</hi> and <hi>Oecolampadius,</hi> all famous Proteſtants in their day, judge rather that he was ſaved; and the whole paſſage of <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Eſau,</hi> beſide, that it hath its hiſtorical fulfilling, is a Figure of two inward Seeds and Births, none of which are reprobated, but the other prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. But if ſome alledge <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.17. to prove that abſolutely <hi>Eſau</hi> was rejected, and did periſh, becauſe its ſaid, <hi>He found no place of Repentance, though he ſought it carefully with Tears.</hi> I anſwer,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:55597:46"/>
that doth not prove his final rejection, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that he could not be heard to have that firſt Bleſſing recalled, which was already given to <hi>Jacob.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. Where now ſhall theſe Men find any place in Scripture to prove, that there are any <hi>reprobate</hi> Infants? Or that any Infants dying in Infancy go to Hell, and periſh eternally, only for <hi>Adam's</hi> Sin, although that Sin was forgiven to <hi>Adam,</hi> and Thouſands more equally guilty, by their own confeſſion? If they ſhall alledge, as ſome do, that place in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.14. <hi>For the unbelieving Husband is ſanctified by the Wife</hi> (viz. that believeth) <hi>and the unbelieving Wife is ſanctified by the Husband, elſe were your Children unclean, but now are they holy.</hi> Yet this cannot prove their Intention: for they dare not confidently ſay, that all Infants of <hi>believing Parents</hi> are elected, otherwiſe they muſt ſay, that <hi>Eſau</hi> was elected, both whoſe Parents were Bellevers. Although ſome in Church-Covenant have gloried, that none of their Children, while Infants, were Reprobates, becauſe they were in covenant, and yet at that ſame time pleading that <hi>Eſau</hi> was a Reprobate in his Mother's Belly, forgetting that both <hi>Eſau's</hi> Parents were more holy than they. And if any further urge, <hi>If there be no reprobate Infants, that then all Infants are ſanctified and holy, both the Children of unbelieving Parents, as well as of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers.</hi> I anſwer; it doth not follow by any neceſſary conſequence, although to admit of that Conſequence, is much more tollerable, than
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:55597:47"/>
to ſay, that any Infants periſh eternally, only for <hi>Adam</hi>'s Sin. And as for the general ſtate of Infants, and how they are particularly diſpoſed of immediately after Death, who die in Infancy, ſeemeth a great depth, and is a great myſtery, and is beſt known unto the Lord: For it is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally granted, that God hath his way to reach to Infants, and deal with them, both in the Womb, and upon the Mothers Breaſts; and therefore let us leave ſecret things unto God, until he reveal them, and be ſatisfied with what he hath revealed. Now this is plainly revealed, and declared in the Scriptures, that the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation is not ſimply that <hi>Adam</hi> ſinned, or his Poſterity in, and with him, <hi>but that Light is come into the World, and Men love Darkneſs more than Light</hi>: And as by the offence of one, to wit, the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> Judgment is come upon all to Condemnation; even ſo by the Righteouſneſs on one, to wit, Chriſt the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> the free Gift is come upon all to Juſtification of Life. And tho' Men generally are by Nature, Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Wrath (if it ſhould be granted or allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that by <hi>Nature,</hi> ſignifieth their natural con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, as they are born into the World) yet by the great Mercy, Grace and favour of God, they all have an opportunity or poſſibility to be converted, and become the Children of God. And what that Holineſs or Cleanneſs is, that the Children of one, or both the believing Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents have, is a great Myſtery, I am ſure to many who have that Scripture place oft in their
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:55597:47"/>
Mouths, and greatly glory in it, that they are in Church-Covenant, and therefore they are holy, and their Children; alſo ſome call it federal or Covenant Holineſs, but what is it they know not, whether it be any real thing, or principle of Holineſs, lodged or placed in their Children, more than in the Children of others that are not in their Church-Covenant, they dare not affirm; for many, yea, very many Children of profeſſed <hi>Chriſtians</hi> of all ſorts, when they grow up to Youth, are as unholy, and ſometimes worſe, as the Children of Unbelievers. But that Children generally either of Believers, or Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, are actually ſanctified from the Womb, or in the Womb, cannot be proved from Scripture, or any Obſervation that we can make. It is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded as a rare and great thing, that <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt</hi> was ſanctified from the Mother's Womb, and the like of <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> and ſo perhaps may be gathered of <hi>Moſes,</hi> or ſome others, but theſe rare and ſingular Examples, rather prove, that Children are not in general, actually and <hi>de facto</hi> holy from the Womb; and therefore that Holineſs of Children, mentioned 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. muſt only ſignifie ſome more near capacity in them, than in others, to become actually holy in time to come, and that not of all Children after the Fleſh, but the Children of Promiſe, as <hi>Paul</hi> diſtinguiſheth theſe two ſorts of Children of the ſame Parents, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.8. But who are the Children of the Fleſh, and who are the Children of the Promiſe? Tho' it be well known unto
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:55597:48"/>
God from the beginning, yet commonly it is not known unto Men, until they diſcover themſelves by their Works and Fruits.</p>
               <p n="7">7. As concerning the general ſtate of Mankind by means of <hi>Adams</hi> fall, what the Scripture ſaith of it, is readily believed and granted, and it is ſafeſt in all things, to keep to Scripture words, eſpecially in all caſes and matters that are in Controverſie. For the Scripture is a rich Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury or Store-houſe, ſufficient to afford us Words whereby to expreſs our Faith in all mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of <hi>Christian Doctrin</hi>; and it is not ſafe to leave the Scripture-words, and go to words of Mans wiſdom, and thereby to declare our Faith of Chriſtian Doctrin. Now the Scripture ſaith <hi>That in</hi> Adam <hi>all die,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.22 <hi>and</hi> Rom. 5.12. <hi>That by one Man Sin entred into the World, and death by Sin, and ſo death paſſed upon all Men; for that all have ſinned</hi>: And that Chriſt hath died for all Men, proveth that all Men were dead, as <hi>Paul</hi> argueth the caſe. And <hi>David,</hi> though he was the Son of a good Father, yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wailed the ſtate wherein he was conceived and born, Pſal. 51.5. <hi>Behold I was ſhapen in Iniquity, and in Sin did my Mother conceive me.</hi> And that under <hi>Moſes</hi> Law, an Offering was to be offered up for the Mother and the Child, (<hi>Levit.</hi> 12.4, 5, 6.) when it was Born, and that the Mother ſhould be unclean ſo many days after the Birth of the Child, doth certainly ſignifie a Seed, or Principle of Sin and Corruption, to be conveyed from the Parents to the Children, in the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:55597:48"/>
way of Generation, and that the menſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Humour was held in Scripture to be ſuch a filthy and unclean thing, which is called, <hi>The Fountain of her Blood,</hi> Levit. 20.18. hath the ſame ſignification; alſo, the Circumciſion of Children on the eighth day. And its ſaid in <hi>Job</hi> 25.4. <hi>How can Man be juſtified with God, or how can he be clean, that is born of a Woman</hi>? To wit, in the ordinary way of Generation. And here the natural ſtate of Man is declared, before his ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Regeneration in Chriſt Jeſus: And though that was ſaid by <hi>Bildad,</hi> one of <hi>Job</hi>'s Friends, yet it is confirmed by <hi>Job</hi> himſelf, Chap. 14.4. <hi>Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean? not one.</hi> But this Seed, or Principle of Sin and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, is not charged or imputed unto Men, until they joyn and conſent unto it, and actually obey it, as is clear from <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.13. <hi>For until the Law, Sin was in the World, but Sin is not imputed when there is no Law.</hi> Now, when is it that there is no <hi>Law,</hi> but in the time of <hi>Infancy,</hi> wherein Children are not capable of any Law, or of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Good or Evil, any more than when in the Womb? For until Children begin to have the uſe and exerciſe of their reaſonable underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſo as to know the Right hand from the Left (according to <hi>Jonah</hi> 4.11.) they cannot be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood to be under the Law. But to ſay, that any Infants are eternally damned for that firſt Sin, and without any actual Sin, or Tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of theirs committed in their own Body, is expreſly contrary to Scripture, that ſaith, <hi>The
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:55597:49"/>
Soul that ſinneth ſhall die; and every one ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive according to the Deeds done in the Body, good or evil; and he that ſoweth to the Fleſh, ſhall reap Corruption, as he that ſoweth to the Spirit ſhall reap Incorruption, and Life eternal.</hi> And therefore none ſhall finally periſh, or be loſt, for that firſt Sin, according to Scripture, but for their actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Diſobedience here in this World, and their final Unbelief and Impenitency. For as concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Judgment and Puniſhment of the firſt Sin, it was immediately inflicted after the Fall, to wit, the Death of all in <hi>Adam.</hi> But Chriſt the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> by his death, for all that died in <hi>Adam,</hi> doth give unto all his free Gift, that cometh up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all unto Juſtification of Life; and thus the Plaiſter is as broad as the Sore, and the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine as univerſal as the Diſeaſe; and it is not ſimply the Sin or Diſeaſe, but the refuſing and rejecting the Medicine and Phyſician, that is the cauſe of any Mans final deſtruction. And how, or in what manner <hi>Adam</hi>'s Children and Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity were concerned in that firſt Sin, whether only by <hi>Imputation,</hi> as ſome ſay, or by <hi>real Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipation,</hi> as others ſay, the Wiſe in heart may eaſily judge: Let it ſuffice at preſent, to ſay, that <hi>Adam</hi>'s Children, being his Branches, and he their Root, they do really partake with him both in the defilement, and alſo in the promiſed Seed, in order to their Reſtoration; for when God ſaid to <hi>Adam, In the Day thou eateſt thereof, thou ſhalt ſurely die</hi>; his Children and Poſterity were included.

And God renewed the promiſe to <hi>Abraham,</hi> to make him the Father of all Nations and Families of the Earth, and that in him they all ſhould be bleſſed, and in his Seed; not that this ſhould be fulfilled by his being their Father, according to the Fleſh,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:55597:50"/>
or in the way of carnal Generation; but through Chriſt, who is the Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> by whom the Bleſſing and Grace of God was to come upon all. (<hi>Rom.</hi> 4.16, 17.) and in this reſpect <hi>Abraham</hi> is called the Father of us all, as it is written, <hi>I have made thee a Father of many Nations, before him whom he believed, God quickening the Dead, and calling the things which were not, as though they were</hi>; to wit, the Dead in <hi>Adam,</hi> are all in due time quickned by Chriſt, the promiſed Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> that they may all become the Children of <hi>Abraham,</hi> through Faith in Chriſt Jeſus; for by virtue of Chriſt's Death, and the Promiſe made to <hi>Adam, Noah</hi> and <hi>Abraham,</hi> theſe three general Fathers, all <hi>Adam</hi>'s Poſterity, are holy in a Scripture ſenſe, not actually, but in capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city to become actually Holy, through the holy Seed given unto them, and put into them, as they come to cloſe and joyn with it in true Faith and Obedience: And this doth well anſwer to <hi>Peter's</hi> Viſion, whereby all manner of four footed Beaſts of the Earth, and wild Beaſts, and creeping things, and Fowls of the Air, which God had cleanſed, all Nations of <hi>Adam</hi> are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, <hi>Acts</hi> 10.12, 13, 14, 15.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>
                     <hi>More particularly and largely concerning the way of Reſtoration by Jeſus Chriſt, his dying for all, and giving unto all ſufficiency of Grace, and means of Salvation, whereby they may be ſaved.</hi>
                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>ACcording to the Teſtimony of the holy Scriptures, <hi>Jeſus Chriſt is the Saviour of all Men,</hi> but eſpecially of them that believe 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.10. and he is called the <hi>Saviour of the World,</hi> John 4.42. and <hi>the Saviour of the Body,</hi> Epheſ. 5.23. and that he <hi>hath dyed for all Men,</hi> is the expreſs Teſtimony of the holy Scriptures in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers places, 2 Cor. 5.14, 15. <hi>For the love of Christ conſtraineth us, becauſe we thus judge, that if one dyed for all, then were all dead; and that he dyed for all, that they which live, ſhould not henceforth live unto themſelves, but unto him which died for them,</hi> 1 Tim. 2.4, 5, 6. <hi>God will have all Men to be ſaved, and to come unto the knowledge of the Truth; for there is one God, and one Mediator between God and Men, the Man Chriſt Jeſus, who gave himſelf a Ranſom for all, to be teſtified in due time,</hi> Heb. 2.9. <hi>That he by the Grace of God ſhould taſte death for every Man,</hi> 1 John 2.2. <hi>He is the Propitiation for our ſins, and not for ours only, but for the ſins of the whole World.</hi> But it is commonly alledged by the Adverſaries of Truth, that by <hi>All</hi> in theſe
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:55597:51"/>
places is underſtood, not <hi>all particulars,</hi> but ſome of all ſorts, or all the elect. To this I <hi>anſwer</hi>; the word <hi>All</hi> muſt needs be as full and univerſal, with reſpect to Chriſts death, and the benefit of it, as it is with reſpect to <hi>Adam</hi>'s fall, becauſe the Scripture maketh a plain parallel betwixt all that die in <hi>Adam,</hi> and all that Chriſt died for, as in that fore-cited place, 2 Cor. 5.14. <hi>If one dyed for all, then all were dead</hi>: Now if <hi>All</hi> only ſignifie <hi>Some,</hi> in the firſt part of the verſe, the ſenſe muſt run thus, <hi>If one dyed for</hi> ſome <hi>or a</hi> few, <hi>then</hi> all <hi>were dead</hi>: This quite maketh void the Apoſtles inference; for if Chriſt only dyed for <hi>ſome,</hi> then only <hi>ſome</hi> were dead, and not <hi>all.</hi> Again, in <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.18. the parallel is very plain, <hi>As by the offence of one, Judgment is come upon all, unto Condemnation, even ſo by the Righteouſness of one, the free Gift is come upon all, unto Juſtification of Life</hi>; not that all are actually juſtified, but the free gift is come upon them, that they may be juſtified; and ſo it is, that the two ſides or parts of Parallels are of equal extent. Beſide that, the word <hi>(All)</hi> in Scripture doth moſt commonly ſignifie <hi>all particulars</hi>; and therefore to reſtrict it, in reſpect of Gods Grace and Mercy through Chriſt, ſavours of a narrow Spirit, and this narrowneſs of Spirit in <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians</hi> and <hi>Independents</hi> is a great evil in them, and maketh them ſo peeviſh, uncharitable and cruel.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And whereas they object againſt Chriſt <hi>his dying for all Men,</hi> becauſe he ſaid, <hi>he did not pray
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:55597:51"/>
for the World, and therefore he did not die for the World,</hi> John 17.9. <hi>I pray for them, I pray not for the World.</hi> It may be very well granted, that he dyed not for the World which he doth not pray for: But what World is that? It is not any part of Mankind, as they are conſidered, when firſt born into the World, and having had a time to live in the World, and a day of viſitation, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they might have repented, and have been converted unto God; but as having finally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected the great Mercy and Grace of Chriſt, after many tenders and offers of it, until that the Lord hath wholly left ſtriving with him, by his Spirit in their hearts, and then they become Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probates, and that World whereof Chriſt ſpoke when he ſaid, <hi>he prayed not for the World.</hi> And therefore it ought to be well noted and conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that when it is ſaid, <hi>Christ dyed for the ſins of the World,</hi> it is only with reſpect to ſins paſt, or any other ſins that Men may commit before the preciſe time and period of Gods leaving them, and ceaſing any more to ſtrive with them, when they are become perfected, ſo to ſpeak in ſin and evil, and are as the ripe Tares, fit for burning, having nothing remaining in them of any tenderneſs, ſimplicity or ſincerity, or true Love to God or Man; no grain of Goodneſs or Virtue, nay, not the leaſt Seed, but are whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly become as Droſs, after all the precious Mettal, to the leaſt grain, is extracted or ſeparated from it; for ſuch, I ſay, Chriſt hath neither dyed nor prayed. And thus it may be with many, and is
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:55597:52"/>
with many before they die; and concerning theſe, <hi>John</hi> declared, ſaying, <hi>There is a ſin unto Death, I do not ſay that he ſhall pray for it,</hi> 1 Joh. 5.16. and this is that ſin of final Unbelief and obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Impenitency, wherein men may be permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to live, ſome conſiderable time, before they die. And this is no Contradiction, nor Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtency, but ſerveth greatly to clear the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of this weighty matter, how Chriſt hath dyed for all Men, within a day or time of Grace, and yet hath dyed for none of theſe Men, after they have wilfully neglected that day of Grace, and reſiſted the Spirit of Grace, until he did altogether leave and forſake them. And alſo it is to be conſidered, that though Chriſt hath dyed for all Men, within a day or time of Grace and Mercy, beyond which time they have not the benefit of his death, and there remaineth no more Sacrifice for Sin unto them; yet he hath not died with the ſame equal intention and degree of Love, Kindneſs and Good-will, for them who finally periſh, as for them who are ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; nor are the gracious Providences of God, and his dealings both inwardly and outwardly after the ſame way and manner towards all: And therefore all who ſhall be ſaved at the end of the World, have very great and unſpeakable cauſe to praiſe God, for his more abundant Mercy, Grace and Love towards them in Chriſt Jeſus, and that he, and not they, did make them to differ from others; &amp; yet none that periſh, can have any juſt cauſe to complain againſt God; for when
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:55597:52"/>
that that is ſufficient is given to them, they have no cauſe to complain. But all who are ſaved, God is pleaſed at one time or another, that ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth with his infinite Wiſdom and good pleaſure, ſo to draw, perſwade, move and incline them to come unto him, and when come, ſo to preſerve them with him, and in him, or if at any time he ſuffer them to depart, infallibly to reclaim them, before the end, that they ſhall certainly be ſaved; and this the Lord can well do, ſo as to put a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference betwixt Cattel and Cattel, or Men and Men, without their obſervation, and ſo as neither to give unto the one any occaſion of Preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, nor unto the other, of Deſpair, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out giving any greater meaſure of inward Grace, (although he may and oft doth give a greater meaſure to one than to another; for he is free to give of his own, as he pleaſeth) but only by ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Providences and Diſpenſations, and means of his own chuſing; the one may be taken, and the other left, the one gained and ſaved, and the other not, the inward Grace being the ſame, both in kind and degree, in ſome that are ſaved, and in ſome that are not, as the Parable of the <hi>Pounds</hi> and <hi>Marks</hi> plainly declare, every Servant had his Pound or Mark, which is an equal ſum, and ſome improved it, and ſome not. And of this more abundant Love of God towards <hi>Paul,</hi> he himſelf taketh ſpecial notice, with great Thankſgiving unto God, 1 Tim. 1.14, 16. <hi>And the Grace of our Lord was exceeding abundant, with Faith and Love, which is in Chriſt Jeſus—Howbeit, for this cauſe
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:55597:53"/>
I obtained mercy, that in me firſt Jeſus Chriſt might ſhew forth all Long-ſuffering, for a pattern to them; which ſhould hereafter believe on him to Life everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi> And the like notice he taketh of the great Love of God towards the believing <hi>Epheſians</hi> and <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> for his chuſing them, and ſo for all other Believers of all other Churches and People, that God had choſen them from the beginning; and for this, he ſaid, <hi>he laboured, and endured all things, even for the ſake of the Elect, that they might be ſaved,</hi> 2 Tim. 2.10. And as it is the great work and end of all faithful Miniſters, to gather Gods elect, every where ſcattered, ſo of the Angels, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24.31. and ſo alſo of Chriſt Jeſus according to <hi>John</hi> 6.39. <hi>cap.</hi> 10.27, 28, 29. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 43.5, 6, 7, 8. <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.7. And thus we find a great difference betwixt ſome that were invited to come to the Supper, who when they refuſed, were no more called, but ſentence paſſed againſt them, <hi>that they ſhould not taſte of the Supper,</hi> and others that were compelled to come in, <hi>Luke</hi> 14.23, 24. not by uſing any violent Compulſion, but by infallible Perſwaſions and Motions of his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Love and Grace, that ſhall infallibly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail with them. Nor doth this give to any Man the leaſt occaſion either to preſume or deſpair, as by ſaying, <hi>Either I am elected, or not; if not elected, I cannot be ſaved,</hi> for that doth not follow; and yet it is moſt true, that either a Man ſhall be ſaved, or he ſhall not, being contradictory Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, whereof the one is always true, and the other not. But this doth not infer, that he who
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:55597:53"/>
ſhall not be ſaved, could not be ſaved. And ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no Man certainly knoweth, that he ſhall not, before he diſcover it by his final Impenitency, therefore it is the wiſdom of every Man to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove, with all diligence, that inward Grace, and all outward means and helps afforded him, the which if he do, according to his ability, he ſhall infallibly be ſaved. And though it is moſt true, that there is a certain number elected in Chriſt Jeſus, the elect Head and Foundation, and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner Stone, living and precious, that is infallibly known unto God, which make up a compleat, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire and perfect Body; yet ſeeing none knoweth that great Myſtery, who is in any danger to abuſe it, it is great folly for any Man to preſume, that he is ſafe, or upon a bare ſuppoſition, which can infer no poſitive concluſion, to reſolve to be in any reſpect negligent: And he that by the Grace of God, doth know both his calling and election, that knowledge hath its proper tendency to make him the more diligent, to abound in all due Obedience and Thankfulneſs, which is the only way to retain the knowledge of it, after it is once obtained: And the ſaid above-mentioned <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemma</hi> is as idle and fooliſh, as who would argue, <hi>I ſhall live for a Month or Year to come, or I ſhall not; if I ſhall not, I need take no care to ſave my life, ſeeing I ſhall die; If I ſhall, I need take no care, for without taking care I ſhall live</hi>; for ſeeing both theſe parts of the Argument are but <hi>Hypothetical,</hi> they can infer no poſitive Concluſion. But as to a Mans Salvation, the only ſafe and ſure way of
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:55597:54"/>
arguing is this, <hi>If I uſe the Grace and Means that God hath given me, I ſhall infallibly be ſaved; and if I do not uſe them, I have no ground to expect that I ſhall, and therefore let me with all diligence that is poſſible make uſe of them.</hi> But the Doctrin of <hi>abſolute Reprobation,</hi> that maketh Salvation, or the effectual uſe of the means <hi>abſolutely impoſſible</hi> to many thouſands, yea, as they ſay, to the greateſt part of Mankind, is a moſt woful and miſerable Diſcouragement unto People.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Lord Jeſus Chriſt, by means of his Death, hath procured unto all Men, both <hi>Jews,</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> as the fruit and effect of his death, an inward Principle of divine Grace, Light, Life and Power, that is the free Gift of God unto them, in the hearts of all Men, together with ſubordinate and concurring outward Means and Helps, more or leſs, but ſufficient unto all Men, whereby they may be ſaved one time or another, before the end of the World; and the ordinary outward means of Salvation is the preaching of the Goſpel of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, even Jeſus of <hi>Nazareth,</hi> that was crucified for our Sins, and roſe again for our Juſtification, by qualified Men; or failing of them, by reading, or hearing read the holy Scriptures, by which, after a ſort, the <hi>Prophets</hi> &amp; <hi>Apoſtles</hi> preach unto all men; or failing of theſe outward means, God ſupplying them by his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Teachings and Revelations in mens hearts, and ſome other ſecret ways and manners of his divine Providences, Dealings and Diſpenſations unknown to moſt Men: For the proof of the
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:55597:54"/>
firſt part, ſee <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.18. <hi>Therefore as by the offence of one, Judgment came upon all Men, to Condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; even ſo by the Righteouſness of one, the free Gift is come upon all men unto Juſtification of Life: the which Righteouſneſs of one, is the active and paſſive Obedience of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, by which the free Gift is come upon all.</hi> The which free Gift is called <hi>Grace,</hi> and <hi>the Gift of Righteouſness,</hi> and is expreſſed in this Chapter by four ſundry Greek Words in the Greek Text, as <hi>Charis, Chariſma, Dorea Dorema,</hi> all very ſignificant; ſee further John 1.9. <hi>He was that true Light that lighteth eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Man that cometh into the World.</hi> And he is called, <hi>The Light of Men,</hi> John 1.4. and John 8.12. <hi>I am the Light of the World, he that followeth me ſhall not walk in Darkness, but ſhall have the Light of Life.</hi> And Tit. 2.11, 12. <hi>For the Grace of God that bringeth Salvation hath appeared unto all Men, teaching us to deny <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ngodliness,</hi> &amp;c. And Verſe 13. <hi>Looking for that bleſſed Hope, and the glorious appearing of that great God, and our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Epheſ. 3.6. <hi>That the</hi> Gentiles <hi>ſhould be fellow. Heirs, and of the ſame Body, and partakers of his Promiſe in Chriſt, by the Gospel.</hi> Col. 1.26, 27. <hi>The Myſtery which hath been hid from Ages and Generations, but now is made manifeſt to his Saints, to whom God would make known what is the Riches of the Glory of this Mystery in the</hi> Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, <hi>which is Chriſt in you, the Hope of Glory.</hi> And Rom. 10.8. <hi>The Word is nigh thee, in thy Mouth, and in thy Heart; and that is the Word of Faith which we preach.</hi> And verſe 6, 7. He underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:55597:55"/>
it of Chriſt, which <hi>Moſes</hi> preached in the People of <hi>Iſrael, Deut.</hi> 30.14. And becauſe this great Myſtery, which was in the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> was much hid in the time of the Law, and in all Ages of the world, until Chriſt came in the Fleſh both in <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> as <hi>Paul</hi> called it, <hi>The Mystery hid from Ages and Generations</hi>; therefore the <hi>Pſalmiſt, Pſal.</hi> 67.2. prayeth, ſaying, <hi>That thy Way may be known upon Earth, thy ſaving Health</hi> (<hi>or thy Jeſus,</hi> Hebr) <hi>in all Nations.</hi> For he ſaw that it was in them, but as it were hid, and vailed, according to the weakneſs and darkneſs of that Diſpenſation; and therefore he prayed unto God, that it might be made known; and therefore as the grace or gift of Chriſt is in all Men, ſo he, who is the Fountain and Root of it, from whom his grace cannot be ſeparate, is in all men, to ſave them, within a Day of Viſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or Salvation; for Chriſt is in all men but Reprobates, according to 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.6. And none are Reprobates, until Chriſt have left them, and given them up to final Impenitency and hardneſs of Heart. And for a proof of the ſecond part, ſee 1 Cor. 1.21. <hi>For after that, in the Wiſdom of God, the World by Wiſdom knew not God; it pleaſed God by the fooliſhness of Preaching to ſave them that believe</hi>: See further, Verſe 22, 23, 24, 25. and Rom. 16.26. John 20.31.</p>
               <p n="4">4. And becauſe of this univerſal Grace and love of God to all Men, and that Chriſt is free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly given of the Father to be a Saviour unto all Men; therefore Chriſt hath commanded that
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:55597:55"/>
his Goſpel ſhould be preached unto all Nations, without exception of any; and did alſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy and fore-tell, that the Goſpel of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom ſhould be preached in all the World, for a Witneſs unto all Nations, before the end of the World; and becauſe he, who cannot lie, hath ſaid it, we are bound to believe, it ſhall be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled, that ſo all mankind may be accountable to the Man Chriſt Jeſus, at the Day of Judgment, either to be rewarded, or puniſhed by him, as they ſhall be found having obeyed, or diſobeyed his glorious Goſpel, that hath been preached unto them, both inwardly and outwardly unto many, if not unto all, but inwardly, to be ſure unto all.</p>
               <p n="5">5. This divine Grace of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, in the Hearts of all men, hath had its various Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations and Manifeſtations, according to the ſeveral Ages of the world, and the ſeveral States and Conditions of men in it, both among <hi>Jews, Gentiles</hi> and <hi>Chriſtians</hi>; and eſpecially both in the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and in the body of the <hi>Jews</hi> and People of <hi>Iſrael</hi> (excepting the Prophets, and others peculiarly favoured of God) the Principle it ſelf was but little made known, or revealed, in reſpect of the great worth of it, and the great Virtue, Power and Glory that was in it, God in his infinite Wiſdom reſerving the more full Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery and Revelation of it to the time after Chriſt his coming in the Fleſh, and Death, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, and Aſcenſion; yet ſo much was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered of it, and ſo much good Fruit it brought
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:55597:56"/>
forth, in the true Lovers and Improvers of it, as by means whereof, they were accepted of God in that day through Chriſt Jeſus.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Whoever were perfectly juſtified, and ſaved in any Place or Family of the World, or Nation, People, or Faculty, they were ſaved only and alone by the Lord Jeſus Chriſt of <hi>Nazareth,</hi> even the Man Chriſt Jeſus, who dyed for them, &amp; roſe again; for there is no other Name given under Heaven, whereby Men can be ſaved, but by that Name, to wit, by the Lord Jeſus Chriſt of <hi>Nazareth,</hi> who was crucified and raiſed again, <hi>Acts</hi> 4.10, 11, 12. But here ſome will readily object, <hi>How could any of the</hi> Gentiles <hi>be justified or ſaved by the Man Chriſt Jeſus, and by virtue of his Death and Reſurrection, who never heard of him, &amp; never had the Myſtery of it revealed unto them, &amp; conſequently had not Faith in Chriſt crucified, and riſen again</hi>? And upon this Head the Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of Truth, both <hi>Presbyterian, Independent</hi> and <hi>Baptiſt</hi> Teachers, have taken great occaſion, to cry out againſt the People, called in ſcorn <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers,</hi> that <hi>their Religion is only</hi> Paganiſm, <hi>and not</hi> Chriſtianity, <hi>becauſe they ſay, that</hi> Heathens <hi>or</hi> Pagans <hi>can be ſaved by their giving Obedience to the Light within them, without having Chriſt cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified, and raiſed again, outwardly preached unto them.</hi> But theſe Adverſaries of Truth little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider what Hypocrites they diſcover themſelves to be, in this very Charge, when they make that a Crime in others, which they judge no Crime in themſelves; for they themſelves hold, <hi>That
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:55597:56"/>
there are not only elect Infants, dying in Infancy, who are regenerated, and ſaved by Chriſt through the Spirit, who worketh when, where, and how he pleaſeth; but other elect Perſons, regenerated and ſaved by Chriſt, who are uncapable of being out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly called by the Word</hi>; citing <hi>Luke</hi> 18.15, 16. <hi>John</hi> 3.3, 5. <hi>John</hi> 3.8. <hi>John</hi> 5.8. ſee Cap. 10. Sect. 3. of the <hi>Weſtminſter</hi>-Confeſſion, owned by the <hi>New-England</hi> Churches, and printed by them at <hi>Boſton.</hi> And what they ſay of Infants, and other elect Perſons, who are uncapable of being outwardly called by the Word, that they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generated, and ſaved by Chriſt through the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, who worketh when, where, and how he pleaſeth; the ſame, theſe called <hi>Quakers</hi> ſay, concerning the honeſt and faithful <hi>Gentiles,</hi> who were obedient to the Light of Chriſt in them, and were not outwardly called by the Word, or by outward Preaching; yea, and were uncapable of being outwardly called, when living in ſuch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote Places and Ages of the world, where the outward Preaching never came within their reach. For as a deaf Man is uncapable of hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a mans Voice, ſo is a man that hath his Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (to wit, the faculty or ſenſe of Hearing) uncapable of hearing the Voice of a man, that is at a greater diſtance than his hearing can reach it. And ſeeing they plainly confeſs, that there are ſuch elect Perſons in the world, not only In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, but theſe come to age, who are Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, and ſaved by Chriſt through the Spirit, who worketh when, where, and how he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:55597:57"/>
as their Words are, (and the Words are true, and a good uſe can be made of them againſt themſelves, who have confeſſed them) then let them forever be aſhamed to cry out any more againſt the honeſt People, called <hi>Quakers,</hi> for ſaying, theſe honeſt <hi>Gentiles,</hi> who have not heard of Chriſt outwardly preached unto them, belonging to God's Election, are ſaved by Chriſt, and regenerated through the Spirit of Chriſt. And if the Spirit work when, where, and how he pleaſeth, to wit, both in Infants, and perſons at Age, who are not outwardly called by the Word, or uncapable of being ſo called, then let them recal and condemn their falſe Doctrin, that ſaith, <hi>God hath committed his Counſel wholly to Writing; and the former ways of God's revealing his Will unto his People are now ceaſed, and there is no new Revelation:</hi> As they have expreſly, and without any reſerve or exception, affirmed, <hi>cap.</hi> 1. <hi>ſect.</hi> 1. and <hi>ſect.</hi> 6. For if God hath committed his Counſel wholly to Writing, then nothing of his Counſel is extant, where that Writing is not extant. And if all divine Revelation be ceaſed, then neither Infants, nor other Perſons, who are uncapable of being outwardly called by the Word, have any divine Revelation, or inward Call by the Spirit: Or if Infants, and other Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons belonging to God's Election, be inwardly called, and renewed by the Spirit, then God hath not committed his Counſel wholly to Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, nor are all the ways of God's revealing his Will to men ceaſed: for by their own Confeſſion,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:55597:57"/>
it is revealed to all elect Perſons, who are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of being outwardly called by the Word, the Spirit working in them, when, where, and how he pleaſeth.</p>
               <p n="7">7. But whether any are, or can be ſaved or juſtified, without the expreſs Knowledge and Faith of Chriſt crucified, and riſen again, is one Queſtion; and whether without all outward hearing of Chriſt crucified, outwardly Preached unto them, is another Queſtion: For without all outward preaching of Men, the myſtery of Chriſt crucified can be revealed, and preached inwardly to Men by the Spirit of God, and by the ſame Spirit, Faith can be wrought in them by that inward hearing, as theſe Men confeſs. And though it may ſeem hard and difficult, to prove that all honeſt <hi>Gentiles,</hi> who did by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture (to wit, by the Principle of the <hi>divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> implanted into the true Nature of Men) the things contained in the Law, had that expreſs Knowledge and Faith of Chriſt crucified, and raiſed again; yet it is more hard and difficult unto them, who affirm they had it not, to prove it, ſeeing the Spirit, who worketh when, and where, and how he pleaſeth, might reveal it unto them; and that they grant, <hi>the Spirit doth work in all elect Perſons, who are not outwardly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by the Word, and doth regenerate and ſave them by Christ.</hi> And to the further clearing of this matter we are to conſider, that the Work of Salvation is not a thing that is commonly done in an inſtant, but hath its gradual Steps, its

                  <hi>beginning, progress</hi> and <hi>finiſhing,</hi> even as Faith it ſelf hath; for as at the firſt inſtant of a Man's ſincere believing, he is en<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>ed into a ſtate of Salvation, ſo as his Faith groweth, his Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion doth gradually encreaſe and grow with it, the which <hi>Salvation</hi> is not only a <hi>Salvation from Wrath to come,</hi> or from Hell fire and torment, but is a <hi>Salvation from Sin,</hi> and from under the Power of Darkneſs, and from all Ignorance, and Error, and Darkneſs of Underſtanding, and a thorow renewing into the Image of God, and bringing Man into Conformity unto the Image of the Son of God, the heavenly and ſecond <hi>Adam</hi>: And the true knowledge of Chriſt, and of God the Father, being a part of the Image of God, that is to be renewed in them that are to be ſaved, according to Col. 3.10. <hi>And have put on the new Man, which is renewed in</hi> Knowledge, <hi>after the Image of him that created him.</hi> Therefore it doth neceſſarily follow, that <hi>perfect Salvation,</hi> in the full extent of it, cannot be had without the full and perfect knowledge of Chriſt, the which full and perfect knowledge of Chriſt, is to know him, both as he is that eternal Word, and Son of God, the only begotten of the Father, who was with the Father before the World was, by whom all things were made, and as he is God manifeſt in the Fleſh, juſtified in the Spirit, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to wit, Chriſt crucified and raiſed, which <hi>Paul</hi> calleth <hi>the great Mystery of Godliness</hi>: And that both Salvation and Faith is gradual, and hath its ſteps and progreſs, beginning, growth and

perfection, is very clear, both from the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures Teſtimony, and the Saints experience<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for <hi>Paul</hi> writing to the believing <hi>Philippians,</hi> exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them to work out their Salvation with Fear and Trembling, 2 <hi>Philip.</hi> 12. So, though they were entred into a ſtate of Salvation, through Faith in Chriſt, yet it was not perfected in them, but was to be further wrought out; and to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage them in this great Work, he told them, <hi>It was God which worketh in them, both to will and to do of his own good pleaſure.</hi> And <hi>Paul</hi> encouraged the believing <hi>Romans,</hi> and alſo himſelf, ſaying, <hi>Now is our Salvation nearer than when we believed,</hi> Rom. 13.11. And the perfect <hi>Salvation of Souls</hi> is called the <hi>end of Faith,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.9. And verſe 10. <hi>Of which Salvation the Prophets have enquired, and ſearched diligently, who prophecyed of the Grace that ſhould come unto you.</hi> Verſe 11. <hi>Searching what, or what manner of time the Spirit of Christ, which was in them did ſignifie, when it testified be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-hand the Sufferings of Chriſt, and the Glory that ſhould follow.</hi> And Verſe 13. <hi>Wherefore gird up the Loins of your Mind, be ſober, and hope to the end, for the Grace that is to be brought unto you in the Revelation of Jeſus Chriſt</hi> (ſo the Greek hath, viz. <hi>Enapokalepſei</hi>) And Philip. 1.6. <hi>Being confident of this very thing, that he which hath begun a good Work in you, will perform it unto the Day of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> And as the Work of the outward Creation, is diſtinguiſhed into ſix Days, and that a Day of Sabbath, or Reſt, which is the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection: So the Work of the inward Creation,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:55597:59"/>
which is the creating Men anew in Chriſt Jeſus, by way of Analogy, may be ſaid to have its ſix Days, and then the ſpiritual Sabbath, or Reſt, according to <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.9. <hi>There remaineth therefore a Sabbath to the People of God.</hi> And verſe 11. <hi>For he that is entred into his Reſt, hath ceaſed from his own Works, as God did from his.</hi> And Verſe 11. <hi>Let us labour therefore to enter into that Rest,</hi> &amp;c. Where its plain, the Writer doth hint at the ſaid Analogy. Now though it ought to be granted, that the Knowledge and Faith of Chriſt crucified and raiſed again, doth belong to the finiſhing and perfecting of the Saints Salvation, yet it is moſt clear and plain from Scripture, that it doth not univerſally belong to the beginning of it. For we can prove moſt clearly from Scripture, that the good work of God, even the Work of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation was begun in them, who had not that Knowledge and Faith of Chriſt crucified; as firſt, to inſtance in <hi>Nathaniel,</hi> of whom Chriſt gave a noble Teſtimony, <hi>Behold an</hi> Iſraelite <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, in whom is no Guile,</hi> John 1.47. And yet at that time he had not Faith in Jeſus of <hi>Naza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth,</hi> as being come in the Fleſh, but reaſoned or queſtioned, ſaying, <hi>Can any good thing come out of</hi> Nazareth? Philip <hi>ſaith unto him, Come and ſee,</hi> &amp;c. Next, to inſtance in the Diſciples of Chriſt, who for ſometime, after they had followed him, and that <hi>Peter</hi> had confeſſed to him, that he was the Son of God, and that Chriſt had told him, his Father had revealed it to him; yet the myſtery of his Death and Reſurrection was for all that
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:55597:59"/>
hid from him, and the reſt of them: For this, ſee <hi>Mark</hi> 9.31. <hi>For he taught his Diſciples, and ſaid unto them, the Son of Man is delivered into the Hands of Men, and they ſhall kill him, and after that he is killed, he ſhall riſe the third Day.</hi> And verſe 32. <hi>But they underſtood not that ſaying, and were afraid to ask him.</hi> See again, <hi>Luke</hi> 9.43. But that inſtance of <hi>Cornelius</hi> is a moſt manifeſt and clear demonſtration of this Truth: For this <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelius</hi> was a <hi>Gentile,</hi> and uncircumciſed, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no Proſelite of the Covenant to be ſure; and though ſome alledge, that he was a Proſelite of the Gate (according to that diſtinction that was among the <hi>Jews</hi> of a two fold ſort of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelites, one of the <hi>Covenant,</hi> that received Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion and the Law, another of the <hi>Gate,</hi> that did not receive Circumciſion) yet this is but barely alledged without all proof. But if he was a Proſelite of the <hi>Gate,</hi> it is certain at that time, when the Angel was ſent unto him, he had no expreſs Knowledge, nor Faith of Chriſt cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, for that was the thing, which <hi>Peter</hi> was ſent to preach unto him, by hearing of which he was to receive the holy Ghoſt, and be ſaved; for the Angel told him, <hi>that</hi> Peter <hi>ſhould ſpeak Words to him, by which he and all his Houſe ſhould be ſaved</hi>; ſee <hi>Acts</hi> 11.14. Now altho' at that time, when the Angel appeared unto him, <hi>Cornelius</hi> had no Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge nor Faith of Chriſt crucified, yet he was in a good eſtate; and well were it for many called <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> that they were in as good eſtate as he then was in: When the Angel appeared to
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:55597:60"/>
him, he told him, <hi>that his Prayers, and his Alms were come up for a memorial before God,</hi> Acts 10.4. And it is ſaid of him, verſe 2. <hi>He was a devout Man, and one that feared God, with all his Houſe, which gave much Alms to the People, and prayed unto God alway.</hi> And with reſpect to this, <hi>Peter</hi> began his Preaching, ſaying, <hi>Acts</hi> 10.34, 35. <hi>Of a truth, I perceive that God is no reſpecter of Perſons, but in every Nation he that feareth him, and worketh Righteouſness, is accepted of him.</hi> Now who dare be ſo bold to ſay, <hi>Cornelius</hi> at this time had no real and true beginning of Salvation, or of ſaving Grace and Faith, before <hi>Peter</hi> did preach Chriſt crucified &amp; raiſed again unto him? For although <hi>Cornelius</hi> had not at that time Faith in Chriſt crucified, yet he had (without all que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion) Faith in God, and in the Word of God that was in his Heart, and that Word was Chriſt in him, though the Myſtery of Chriſt was not fully revealed unto him at that time, and in that ſtate he was accepted of God, &amp; yet not for his Works ſake, but for Chriſt. And therefore, Men may have a beginning of true Faith, and of a true Work of Salvation begun in them, when the Myſtery of Chriſt crucified, and raiſed again, is not revealed unto them. For that Myſtery (being ſo great as it is) was not in that Day, to wit, before Chriſt came and ſuffered in the Fleſh, preached, as one of the firſt and moſt neceſſary things to be firſt known and believed, as with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Faith and Knowledge of which no Man could be in any degree bleſſed, otherwiſe, when
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:55597:60"/>
Chriſt began to Preach, he would have preached it as one of the firſt things; and when he ſent his Diſciples to preach the Goſpel, before he ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered Death, he would have given them an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs Commiſſion to preach it to all People, how he was to be crucified, and raiſed again the third day, but the Myſtery of it at that time they knew not, and therefore could not preach it then: Nor did he preach it himſelf, when he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan his Miniſtry, nor for a conſiderable time af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> until the time drew near that he was to ſuffer. In all that excellent Sermon of his on the Mount, not one Title or Word doth he men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Death and Reſurrection expreſly, but he taught the Law and the Prophets, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded the Spirituality of the Law, in its ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, far beyond the reach and conception which the People had of it at that time, and withal dropped ſome Evangelical Precepts unto them, and taught them the right way of <hi>Prayers, Faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> and <hi>Alms,</hi> and pronounced them bleſſed, that hungred and thirſted after Righteouſneſs, and were poor in Spirit, that were Merciful, that were Meek, and Peace-makers, and that mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and ſuffered for Righteouſneſs ſake. And therefore it may be very ſafely concluded, that the expreſs Knowledge and Faith of Chriſt cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified, is not of abſolute and indiſpenſible neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity (eſpecially where it hath not been preached, nor revealed) unto the beginning of a Man's Salvation, although it is really of abſolute and indiſpenſible neceſſity unto the finiſhing and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:55597:61"/>
of it, becauſe, as hath been already ſaid, our inward renewing unto God, when perfected, in us, is a renewing us perfectly, and not in part only, into the Image of God; and a part of that perfect Image, is the perfect Knowledge of God, and of Jeſus Chriſt, whom to know is Life Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal; and that perfect Knowledge requireth men to know him, as he came in the Fleſh, and died, and roſe again, which is that <hi>great Mystery of Godliness,</hi> as <hi>Paul</hi> called it, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16. But if theſe Men, who own that ſaid Confeſſion of Faith, enquire, whether all theſe honeſt <hi>Gentiles</hi> that lived in the world, or do now live in the world, who have not had Chriſt crucified, out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly preached unto them, but were diligent to frame their Lives, according to the Light that was in them, died in a ſtate of Salvation? I ſay, yea, they did; and this I may the rather ſay, according to their own Doctrin. For what if they had not the perfect Knowledge and Faith of Chriſt crucified, when they lived? Yet they might have it at their Death, to wit, in the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing through the Valley of the ſhadow of Death, according to <hi>Pſal.</hi> 23.4. Even when they are not able to demonſtrate unto the Living, what is then revealed unto them? And as it is in <hi>Job</hi> 33.22, 23, 24. <hi>When a Mans Soul draweth near unto the Grave, and his Life to the Deſtroyers, there may be a Meſſenger with him, an Interpreter, one of a Thouſand, to ſhow unto Man his <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>prightness, then he is gracious unto him, and ſaith, Deliver him from going down to the Pit; I have found a Ranſom, or

Attonement</hi>; ſee the <hi>Hebr.</hi> or Margin of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Bible. Or if I ſhould ſay, they receive this perfect Knowledge of Chriſt after Death, it is according to your Doctrin, who ſay, <hi>The Souls of the Righteous</hi> (<hi>generally</hi> or <hi>univerſally</hi>) <hi>af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Death</hi> (note, <hi>after Death</hi>) <hi>being then made perfect in Holiness, are received into the highest Heavens,</hi> &amp;c. Theſe are the expreſs Words of your <hi>Catechiſm,</hi> cap. 32. ſect. 1. But when, and how, or at what preciſe time theſe honeſt <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,</hi> who uſed their greateſt diligence to frame their Lives according to the Light that is in them, and yet have not had the Death, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of Chriſt outwardly preached unto them, when they then lived in the World, is not my preſent buſineſs to determine: It doth ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, that I have demonſtrated from Scripture, that Men have been in a ſtate of Salvation, and acceptance with God, who have not had the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of Chriſt, his Death and Reſurrection, made known unto them; and ſurely, theſe Men continuing faithful to what they had received, when they died, could not periſh. For it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible that any Man, who hath the Work of Salvation really begun in him, though but as a Child in Knowledge, that holdeth faſt the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of his Confidence firm unto the end, can periſh, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.14.</p>

The operations belonging to the Law, as inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſpenſed, the Adminiſtrations to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, and to Chriſt's coming in the Fleſh, and to the Apoſtles, their Preaching, both before and after Chriſt was crucified, and roſe again, and afterwards the Gifts to the holy Spirit, as they were the effect, and fruit of the Apoſtles Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and the end of it: And according to the Scripture, the firſt is that divine Diſpenſation proper to Men, as Children, in the Knowledge of God, and in Virtue; the ſecond, to that which is proper to Men, as in Youth, or middle Age; the third as proper to Men of full, or ripe Age. And each of theſe Diſpenſations may be ſaid to have their proper and peculiar inward <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> or <hi>ſpiritual Waſhing</hi>; the firſt being the Baptiſm of the Father; the ſecond being the Baptiſm both of the Father, and of the Son; the third being the Baptiſm of the Father, the Son, and the holy Ghoſt, which Chriſt commanded his Diſciples
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:55597:62"/>
to adminiſter, after he roſe from the dead, and gave the holy Ghoſt, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.19. which is not to be ſo underſtood, as if the three, to wit, the Father, the Son, and the holy Ghoſt, did not work together in all theſe three Diſpenſations; for certainly they did; but becauſe in the firſt Diſpenſation, God only was known as Creator, and Father of all mankind; in the ſecond, both the Father and the Son were known<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and in the third, the Father, the Son, and the holy Ghoſt are known, and the Myſtery of the three, and of the more abundant divine Grace that accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panieth this Knowledge, largely opened and revealed. And though I ſay the firſt belonged to the Law, as inwardly diſpenſed, yet that very Diſpenſation of the Law was not meerly Legal, but had Grace and Mercy mixed with it: For no Diſpenſation, without the Grace and Mercy of God, could have been in any reſpect ſerviceable unto Men; therefore the Law, both as outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and inwardly adminiſtred, had always ſome meaſure of divine Grace mixed with it; and therefore in the ſecond Commandment, the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of all the Ten Commandments, being commonly acknowledged to have been delivered by God himſelf to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> who had not the written Law, God did reveal himſelf <hi>to be a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and merciful God, viſiting the Iniquities of the Fathers upon the Children, unto the third and fourth Generation, but ſhewing Mercy to Thouſands of them that love him, and keep his Commandments.</hi> And as I have already proved from the expreſs
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:55597:63"/>
Teſtimony of the holy Scripture, by the Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of one, to wit, the Lord Jeſus, who dyed for all, the free Gift and Grace of God is come upon all unto Juſtification of Life, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.18. And Chriſt himſelf is the Myſtery hid in the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> being that <hi>Word of Faith</hi> which <hi>Moſes</hi> preached in the <hi>Jews,</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> in the <hi>Romans,</hi> Chap. 10.</p>
               <p n="9">9. And ſince it is ſo, that Chriſt is really that Light that doth lighten the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and is Light in them, who have not heard him outwardly preached unto them, it is no leſs than real Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy (though pardonable upon Repentance) to ſay, as the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> and <hi>Independent</hi> Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers of both Old and <hi>New-England</hi> have ſaid in their Confeſſion of Faith, <hi>That the Light in men,</hi> (which they call, the Light of Nature) <hi>that doth ſo far manifeſt the Goodneſs, Wiſdom and Power of God, as to leave men inexcuſable, yet is not ſufficient to give that Knowledge of God, which is neceſſary unto Salvation</hi>; as they expreſly affirm <hi>cap.</hi> 1. <hi>ſect.</hi> 1.

For as Chriſt is called the <hi>Light of men</hi> in Scripture, (<hi>John</hi> 1.4. <hi>In him was Life, and the Life was the Light of men</hi>) ſo
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:55597:63"/>
he may be very well called the <hi>Light of Nature,</hi> to wit, lightning the dark Nature of man; and not only ſo, but quickning and ſanctifying Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in all men, who joyn thereunto, and the <hi>Word of God in the Heart, James</hi> calleth it, <hi>Ton Emphuton Logon,</hi> the innate Word, <hi>i. e.</hi> put into the Nature of men, which is able to ſave their Souls.

And therefore any Light or Illumination that theſe <hi>Gentiles</hi> had in them, or that any men have in them, is a new Gift and Grace of God, and gracious Viſitation of God unto them, as the Apoſtle calleth it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.18. Moreover, that God himſelf doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly ſpeak to men generally in their Hearts, both in good men and bad, and is their Teacher, and doth warn them, yea, and fore-warn them of Evil and Wrath to come, and doth reprove and convince them of Sin, is the Teſtimony of the holy Scripture in many places; ſee <hi>Pſal.</hi> 94.10. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50.1, 16, to 22. <hi>Amos</hi> 4.13. <hi>Micah</hi> 6.8. <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.1, 2, 3, 4. <hi>Job</hi> 28.28. Chap. 24.13. and 21.14. And it is a place greatly worth noticing, <hi>Luke</hi> 12.20. <hi>God ſaid unto him, Thou Fool, this Night thy Soul ſhall be required of thee.</hi> And where did God ſay thus to him, but in his Heart? And therefore it hath been the way of God, and ever will be to ſpeak to men in their Hearts, to call them, and warn, and fore-warn them of evil and danger, and to perſwade and incline them to that which is good: And they
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:55597:65"/>
who deny this, as they belye God, and ſay, <hi>It is not the Lord that ſpeaketh, and calleth to men in their Hearts</hi>; ſo they do a great injury and wrong unto men, who inſtead of turning them to God's Teachings in their Hearts, turn them away from them; and they do ill deſerve ſo great Wages of the People, ſo to turn away the Ears of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple from God's inward teachings in their Hearts, and from the Word of his Grace, which is able to ſave their Souls. And to conclude, although the diſpenſations of the divine Grace be various, and may be variouſly diſtinguiſhed into a more or leſs number, yet God and Chriſt, and the holy Spirit are one, and the one Author of all theſe various Diſpenſations; and who-ever is faithful unto God in any of them, is accepted in Chriſt, and for Chriſt's ſake, and not otherwiſe. And though the laſt, which is the pure and perfect Chriſtian and Goſpel Diſpenſation, is far more excellent, and far ſurpaſſing either that among the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> who had not the outward Law, or that among the <hi>Jews</hi> and People of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> who had the outward Law, and the Prophets, yet every one of them had their Glory in their day, and that inward divine Diſpenſation that is now among the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> who have not Chriſt as yet outwardly preached unto them, hath its Glory and great Service and Bleſſing to them who are faithful to God in it; and ſuch who continue faithful therein to the end, ſhall never periſh; and though it be not purely and throughly <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian</hi> and <hi>Evangelical,</hi> but rather more Legal,
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:55597:65"/>
yet it is alſo partly <hi>Christian</hi> and <hi>Evangelical,</hi> and the pure Goſpel Diſpenſation is hid within it, as a Wheel within a Wheel, or as the moſt holy place was hid within the outer Court, and there, to wit, in that firſt Diſpenſation, Chriſt, as it were, lieth as in ſwadling Cloathes: and though the <hi>Jews</hi> do not know him as he is there, yet ſuch as the Wiſe men from the Eaſt, do both know and honour him, as the King of the <hi>Jews,</hi> yea, as King and Lord, both of Heaven and Earth, who is in all, and through all, and over all, bleſſed forever, <hi>Amen.</hi>

                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p n="1">1. WHen the Scripture ſaith, <hi>God justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ngodly,</hi> Rom. 4.5. It is not to be underſtood that he doth juſtifie them in their Ungodlineſs, but from it; as the like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Speech is uſed, <hi>Acts</hi> 13.39. <hi>And by him all that believe, are justified from all things, from which ye could not be justified by the Law of</hi> Moſes. For ſeeing, according to the Law of God, <hi>He that justifieth the Wicked is an Abomination to the
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:55597:66"/>
Lord,</hi> Prov. 17.15. God himſelf can do no ſuch thing, as to juſtifie a wicked or ungodly man in his Ungodlineſs.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As it is only the true believer, who hath Faith in Chriſt Jeſus, whom God juſtifieth; ſo it is only he who is truly ſanctified, and regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated or born again of the Spirit of God, whom God doth juſtifie, who are called the Seed of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> Iſa. 45.25. <hi>In the Lord ſhall all the Seed of</hi> Iſrael <hi>be juſtified, and ſhall glory.</hi> For as a Rich Man, when he dyeth, by his Will or Teſtament, leaveth his Goods or Riches not to Strangers, but to his own Kindred, as his Brethern, or Children, and to his Wife; ſo our Lord Jeſus Chriſt hath left by his Will and Teſtament, when he dyed, his Spiritual Goods, to wit, <hi>Remiſſion of Sin, Juſtification, Adoption,</hi> and <hi>Eternal Life,</hi> only to his true ſpiritual Kindred, to wit, his Brethren, who are born from Above, and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually related unto him, who are the true Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God, by ſpiritual Regeneration, and renewing of the holy Ghoſt, and who are his true Church, and Body, and of his Fleſh and Bones, according to <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.30.</p>
               <p n="3">3. And therefore not only <hi>Faith,</hi> but true inward <hi>Sanctification,</hi> and a thorow inward re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing into the Image of God, and Conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the whole man, unto the Image of the Son of God, is a Condition and Qualification neceſſarily required, in order unto mens being perfectly juſtified in the ſight of God; and as no man is juſtified, but who is ſanctified, ſo no
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:55597:66"/>
man is any more, or further juſtified than he is ſanctified.</p>
               <p n="4">4. According unto which, God doth juſtifie men, not only by Faith in Chriſt, but by a real inward Righteouſneſs or Holineſs, which he doth beget in them by his holy Spirit, and not only <hi>Faith,</hi> but <hi>Love, Hope, true Righteouſneſs,</hi> and <hi>Holineſs, Meekneſs, Temperance</hi> and <hi>Humility,</hi> and all other Evangelical Virtues, and Fruits of the holy Spirit, are the Inſtruments and Means whereby men obtain free Juſtification through Chriſt Jeſus, and whereby they are enabled, and fitted or qualified to apply Chriſt Jeſus, and his Righteouſneſs unto them, ſo as to have the ſame imputed unto them, and made theirs, to wit, Chriſt, and all his ſpiritual Bleſſings, Gifts and Benefits, and his Death, and Sufferings, and Obedience, with all the bleſſed Effects and Fruits of it. For as a Line that is ſtraight cannot be applyed unto another Line that is crooked, but unto a Line that is ſtraight; ſo cannot the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who is the Righteouſneſs of God, be applyed unto men for Juſtification, unleſs theſe men be made righteous, as he is in likeneſs, or conformity unto him, although not equal un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him: And therefore <hi>John</hi> did ſeaſonably give the warning and caution, fore-ſeeing that many would claim to be righteous, or juſtified, when they were not really doers or workers of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.7. <hi>Little Children, let no man deceive you; he that doth Righteouſneſs, is righteous, even as he is righteous.</hi> And the ſame <hi>John</hi> ſaid,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:55597:67"/>
                  <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.14. <hi>Bleſſed are they that do his Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that they may have right to the Tree of Life,</hi> &amp;c. Which is equivalent to their being juſtified, ſeeing Juſtification doth include in its Nature, a Right, or Intereſt in Chriſt, who is that Tree of Life.</p>
               <p n="5">5. It is therefore a groſs Error, and a falſe and Antichriſtian Doctrin, in theſe Faith-pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhers at <hi>Westminſter,</hi> eſpouſed by the <hi>Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians</hi> and <hi>Independant</hi> Teachers in <hi>New-England, That God doth justifie men, not by infuſing Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs into them, but by pardoning their Sins, and accepting them as righteous,</hi> &amp;c. cap. 11. ſect. 1, 2. And alſo, that, they ſay, <hi>Faith receiving and reſting on Christ, and his Righteouſneſs, is the alone Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Juſtification,</hi> is another great Error. For as <hi>Faith</hi> may well be compared to one Hand of the Soul, whereby it receiveth and embraceth the Lord Jeſus Chriſt; ſo <hi>Love,</hi> which is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Evangelical Grace and Virtue, that is ſhed abroad or infuſed into the Soul, by the holy Ghoſt, may be compared to another Hand and Arm, whereby it doth receive and embrace him. And all the inward Evangelical divine Virtues and Graces that are wrought and begot in the Soul, by the holy Spirit of Chriſt, are, ſo to ſpeak, as a whole intire Body, conſiſting of many Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, whereby the Soul doth embrace and cleave unto the Lord Jeſus Chriſt; and thus a perfect Union cometh to be witneſſed betwixt the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Soul, and the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, when it is joined unto him, receiveth him, and cleaveth
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:55597:67"/>
unto him, not by one ſingle Grace or Virtue, call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Faith,</hi> but by all other divine Graces and Virtues, which make up a whole intire Body, having many Members and Joynts, whereby the Soul cleaveth to him, as one ſtreight Line is joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to another, or as one ſtreight Body to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, not in part only, but in all parts. And thus alſo doth the Lord Jeſus Chriſt embrace the whole Soul in all its ſpiritual and divine Powers and Virtues, that he hath freely conferred upon it: And hence it is, that true Believers are ſaid to put on the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, as a man putteth on a Garment. Now he that putteth on a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat or intire Garment, every part of his Body cleaveth to it; even ſo the Soul that putteth on Chriſt, cleaveth to him by all its ſpiritual Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, which are the divine Evangelical Virtues, wrought in it by the holy Spirit of Chriſt, even as the Sins and evil Luſts are called the Members on Earth, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.5.</p>
               <p n="6">6. But though real inward <hi>Holineſs</hi> and <hi>Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs,</hi> as well as <hi>Faith,</hi> be the Inſtruments, whereby men are juſtified, yet they are not the Foundation and Ground of Juſtification, but the Lord Jeſus Chriſt alone, even Jeſus of <hi>Nazareth,</hi> who dyed for our Sins, without the Gates of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi> and roſe again in his intire and perfect Obedience and Righteouſneſs, is the alone and only Foundation and ground of Juſtification, on which the Souls of all the Faithful are to reſt for Juſtification, and Remiſſion of all Sin; and therefore no man is to reſt or relie upon the beſt
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:55597:68"/>
Works, or Righteouſneſs, or Obedience, that he doth or can do, even when helped to perform the ſame, by the help of the holy Spirit: For this were to put good Works in the room of Chriſt, which ought not to be; for no Works of Righteouſneſs or Holineſs done by us, even by the help of the holy Spirit, is the Foundation of the Saints <hi>Faith,</hi> or <hi>Juſtification,</hi> but Chriſt alone, and the <hi>free Love, Mercy, Grace</hi> and <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour</hi> of God the Father revealed in him, and by him, through the holy Spirit. For ſeeing all men generally have ſinned, no mans beſt Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence for Sin formerly committed, can be a Ranſom unto God, but Chriſt alone is the Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom, even he who was Crucified, and roſe again, (1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.18.) <hi>The Juſt having ſuffered for the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>njuſt, that he might bring us unto God.</hi> And as no man can redeem the Soul of his Brother, ſo, nor can he redeem his own Soul; <hi>For the Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Soul is precious, and ceaſeth forever,</hi> Pſal. 49.8. <hi>viz.</hi> to be the Work of man, but it is only and alone the Work of him, who is both God and Man, according to verſe 15. <hi>But God will redeem my Soul from the Power of the Grave, for he ſhall receive me, Selah.</hi> See further theſe other Scriptures, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.7. <hi>Col.</hi> 1.14. <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.12, 15. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.13. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.18. <hi>Rev.</hi> 5.9. <hi>Mat.</hi> 20.28. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.6. <hi>Job.</hi> 33.23, 24.</p>
               <p n="7">7. And ſeeing Remiſſion and Pardon of Sin for Chriſt's ſake, is a part or branch of <hi>Juſtification,</hi> as theſe Faith-publiſhers do acknowledg, and that repentance is of ſuch neceſſity, that none
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:55597:68"/>
may expect pardon without it, as they confeſs, <hi>cap.</hi> 15. <hi>ſect.</hi> 3. Is it not very manifeſt, by their own Confeſſion (though in plain contradiction to their own Doctrin) that Repentance is a neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary Inſtrument and Condition whereby to obtain Juſtification. And indeed the Scripture layeth equal weight upon Repentance and Converſion, as it doth upon Faith, in order to obtain Remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion or Pardon of Sins, <hi>Acts</hi> 3.19. <hi>Repent ye there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and be converted, that your Sins may be blot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out.</hi> Acts 26.18. <hi>To turn them from Darkneſs unto Light, and from the Power of Satan unto God, that they may receive Forgiveneſs of Sins,</hi> &amp;c. And when the Scripture ſaith, <hi>Titus</hi> 3.5. <hi>Not by Works of Righteouſneſs, which we have done, but according to his Mercy he ſaved us.</hi> It is clear, that Works before, or without true Faith are underſtood, and not the inward Work of San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification, as is clear from the following Words, <hi>by the waſhing of Regeneration, and renewing of the holy Ghoſt.</hi> And if the real inward Work of <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification</hi> and <hi>Obedience</hi> had not been neceſſary to Salvation, the Scripture would not have ſaid, <hi>Work out your Salvation with Fear and Trembling: And if ye through the Spirit do mortifie the Deeds of the Body, ye ſhall live.</hi> And therefore when <hi>Paul</hi> doth ſo earneſtly plead that men are not juſtified by the Works of the Law, it is evident, he doth only exclude theſe legal Performances and Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations that the <hi>Jews</hi> reſted in, who had not Faith in Chriſt. And that no Works, however ſo good or holy, being performed by men, ought
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:55597:69"/>
to be reſted in, as a Foundation or ground of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification, for that were to exclude Chriſt, and make his Death of no effect. And again, when <hi>James</hi> doth plead ſo earneſtly, that <hi>men are juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by Works, and not by Faith only,</hi> giving an inſtance in <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Rahab,</hi> he only placeth Faith and Works together (<hi>viz.</hi> ſuch Works as accompany true Faith, and work together with it) as neceſſary Inſtruments and Conditions, whereby to obtain Juſtification, but not to be the Foundation thereof.</p>
               <p n="8">8. And whereas <hi>Paul</hi> generally ſo much uſeth that manner of Speech, of <hi>Juſtification by Faith,</hi> it is manifeſt that by Faith, he doth not mean only that ſingle Virtue called <hi>Faith,</hi> but as by way of <hi>Synecdoche,</hi> the moſt eminent, or noted part, is put for the whole, as when in Scripture as well as in common Speech, the Head of a man is put for the whole man, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33.4. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 17.9. Even ſo by Faith, the Apoſtle in theſe places doth mean the whole complex or ſyſteme, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire Body of the Evangelical Virtues and Graces, whereof Faith is as it were the Head, and is firſt in order of Nature, at leaſt, in reſpect of the other; and ſometimes alſo by Faith he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandeth, the whole Evangelical Diſpenſation and Doctrin, as eſpecially in that noted place, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.23. <hi>But before FAITH came, we were kept under the Law,</hi> &amp;c. And verſe 5. <hi>But after that FAITH is come,</hi> &amp;c. Where certainly <hi>Paul</hi> doth not mean only that ſingle Virtue, called <hi>Faith,</hi> but the whole Evangelical Diſpenſation,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:55597:69"/>
with all the ſpiritual Gifts and Graces of it. And again, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.2. <hi>Received ye the Spirit by the Works of the Law, or by the hearing of Faith?</hi> which hath the ſame ſignification. And thus in common Speech among <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> and <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Writers, the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Faith doth ſignifie the whole <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Religion and Obedience; and ſo Unbelief in Scripture is put for all other Sin that Men generally are under, before they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.32.</p>
               <p n="9">9. True Faith in Chriſt Jeſus, (on whom alone the Soul reſteth, as on the true Foundation for Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification, and all other divine and ſpiritual <hi>gifts</hi> &amp; <hi>bleſſings</hi>) is not only a believing in him, as he is the <hi>Word,</hi> which was in the beginning with God, and is God, by whom all things were made, and which was in all the Prophets, and faithful and holy Men in all Ages, but as the ſame Word did take Fleſh, and was God manifeſt in the Fleſh, ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified in the Spirit, &amp;c. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16. which <hi>Paul</hi> called, <hi>The great Mystery of Godlinss,</hi> to wit, <hi>Chriſt crucified, and riſen again, made of a Woman, made under the Law, the Son of God, that did come in the likeness of ſinful Fleſh, made like un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us in all things, Sin excepted; who being in the form of God, and thought it no Robbery to be equal with God, humbled himſelf, and took upon him the form of a Servant; and was found in the true Form and Nature of a Man, the Seed of</hi> Abraham <hi>and</hi> David, <hi>conceived by the holy Ghoſt, and born of the Virgin</hi> Mary, <hi>at</hi> Bethlem, <hi>in the Land of</hi> Judah. And thus the true Faith doth not divide
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:55597:70"/>
Chriſt, but receiveth him, and joyneth the Soul unto him entirely, to wit, the whole and intire Chriſt, both as he did come outwardly in the Fleſh, and as he did, and doth inwardly come in the Spirit; and as the ſaid true Faith doth not divide him, ſo nor doth it divide his Offices, but taketh or receiveth him in all his Offices, as <hi>King, Prieſt</hi> and <hi>Prophet, Shepherd, Phyſician, Huſband,</hi> &amp;c. And as he is called (<hi>Jerm.</hi> 23.6.) <hi>The Lord our Righteouſness,</hi> in Scripture; ſo as none can have him to be their Righteouſneſs and Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, but who have him to be their Lord, King and Ruler in them, and their Sanctification, Wiſdom and Redemption. And thus every tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly believing Soul, is as the true Mother of the Child, who would not have the Child divided; but ſhe who was not the true Mother of the Child, ſhe would have the Child divided; a true Figure of all falſe <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> who would have Chriſt divided, and ſay, <hi>They believe in Christ without them,</hi> but do not believe and receive Chriſt within them, as God the Father doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly reveal him; or as <hi>Ranters,</hi> and other high Notioniſts, who pretend to believe in Chriſt, as he is the Word and Light in them, but ſlight and blaſpheme againſt Chriſt that was cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified without them. Whereas the true Believer doth both believe in Chriſt, and receive Chriſt, as he came in the Fleſh, and was crucified for our Sins, and roſe and aſcended into Heaven, and is now in Heaven glorified, in the intire and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Nature of man, in Soul and Body, appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:55597:70"/>
in the preſence of God for us, our Advocate with the Father, and alſo doth believe in him, and receive him ſpiritually, to live and dwell in his Heart, as he is the Lord that Spirit, and the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> or heavenly Man, the quickning Spirit, who is the true ſpiritual Meat and Drink to every believing Soul, even as Chriſt ſaid, <hi>I am the true Bread of Life, he that eateth me, ſhall live by me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="10">10. And this true Faith, in the leaſt true mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of it, as it is an act or exerciſe, hath aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in it, of the Love and Mercy of God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed in Chriſt Jeſus; and true infallible Aſſurance is of the very Nature and Being of true Faith, as it is exerciſed on Chriſt, its true and proper Object and Foundation, and upon the Love and Mercy of God the Father revealed in Chriſt; hence <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid, <hi>That his Goſpel came un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to theſe to whom he preached, not in Speech only, but in Power, and in the holy Ghoſt, and in much Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,</hi> or as the <hi>Greek</hi> hath it, <hi>much full Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,</hi> 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.5. And he ſaid further, <hi>his Preaching was in the Demonſtration of the Spirit, and of Power,</hi> 1 Cor. 2.4, 5. <hi>That their Faith ought not to be in the Wiſdom of Man, but in the Power of God</hi>: And this was ſure footing, and had aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in it, as the building on the ſure Rock. But they who deny all inward new Revelation of the Spirit, its no wonder they deny that Faith hath Aſſurance in the Being and Nature of it. But without divine inward Revelation, which begetteth Aſſurance, there is no true Faith, but
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:55597:71"/>
only Opinion, or Conjecture, ſeeing there is no midſt betwixt Aſſurance and Opinion, or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture; and therefore theſe Faith-Publiſhers, have denyed the true Faith of God's Elect, when they ſay, <hi>It may be without Aſſuranee, and that infallible Aſſurance doth not belong ſo to the eſſence of Faith, but that a true Believer may wait long, and Conflict with many Difficulties, before he be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker of it</hi>; ſee Chap. 18. Sect. 3. And it is yet as ſtrange, that they affirm, <hi>That a Man without divine new Revelation</hi> (which here they call <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary,</hi> although in their firſt Chapter, they have denyed all new divine Revelation, even ſince the Apoſtles) <hi>can be infallibly aſſured, that he is in favour with God</hi>; the which Aſſurance they ſeem to ground upon the <hi>inward Evidences of the Graces of God, and the Testimony of the Spirit of Adoption, witneſſing with our Spirits that we are the Children of God.</hi> But whether this be not a manifeſt Contradiction, one while to aſſert the neceſſity of the inward Evidence of Grace, and the Teſtimony of the Spirit witneſſing with our Spirits, that we are the Children of God; and another while, yea, with the ſame Breath, to deny all inward Revelation of the Spirit; and to ſay, <hi>the Spirit worketh only effectively, and not objectively, and therefore is only</hi> medium incogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum aſſentiendi, to wit, an unknown Principle of aſſenting, let the wiſe in heart conſider and judge. For ſeeing no place of Scripture, telleth us, that we have theſe infallible marks of God's Children, and yet the Spirit doth tell, or witneſs it, to or
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:55597:71"/>
together with our Spirits; this certainly is <hi>a novum effatum,</hi> or new Truth, or ſaying, no where either expreſly or conſequentially con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the Scripture; or if they ſay it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in Scripture, at leaſt conſequentially, to wit, that <hi>J.D.</hi> or <hi>J.C.</hi> hath the infallible marks of a Child of God, let him produce it, or any for him, which they ſhall never be able to do. It is wonderful, that theſe Men have ſuch inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate Prejudice againſt divine inward Revelation, that rather than aſſent to ſo bleſſed and comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Doctrin, they will run into the moſt pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable Non-ſenſe and Contradiction. And when they ſtart from the Teſtimony of the Spirit, as implying divine inward Revelation, they run at laſt to the Teſtimony of a Man's own Heart and Conſcience, not well conſidering that the bare Teſtimony of a Man's Heart and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience cannot infallibly aſſure him, or if it could, it is no divine Teſtimony, but only human, and therefore no true object of divine Faith.</p>

                     <hi>Whether true beginnings of Sanctification can be fallen from totally?

               </argument>
               <p n="1">1. THat real and true beginnings of <hi>Faith,</hi> and <hi>Sanctification,</hi> or <hi>true</hi> and <hi>real Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſness</hi> may be fallen from, is clear from many Teſtimonies of the holy Scripture, eſpecially <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.4, 5, 6, 7, 8. Where, <hi>firſt,</hi> is deſcribed the ſtate of ſome, who do fall away, what it was before they ſo do; as 1<hi>ſt.</hi> that they were enlightned, ſo as to have taſted of the heavenly Gift; 2<hi>dly.</hi> to have been made partakers of the holy Ghoſt; 3<hi>dly.</hi> to have taſted the good Word of God, and the Powers of the World to come; and ſurely, all this could not be without ſome real beginning of <hi>true Sanctification. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,</hi> the ſtate of ſuch is deſcribed, when, or after they do ſo fall away, that <hi>they crucifie to themſelves the Son of God afreſh, and put him to an open ſhame</hi>; and alſo the great danger they are in; ſo that it is impoſſible to renew them again
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:55597:73"/>
unto Repentance: But how far this Impoſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity doth extend, whether to a ſimple Impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, or only in ſome reſpect, is not the preſent buſineſs to determin, and to the ſame purpoſe the Author writeth, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.26, 27, 28. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Romans,</hi> Chap. 11. doth not only affirm, that many <hi>Jews</hi> and People of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> who were the natural Branches, were broken off from the Root (which Root is Chriſt) by unbelief, but warneth the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving <hi>Gentiles,</hi> of their great danger, alſo to be cut off, if they did not keep in holy fear and watchfulneſs, ſee Verſe 20.21, 22. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> The Apoſtles, <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Jude</hi> ſet before the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,</hi> the fearful Examples of the fallen Angels, and of the old World, and alſo of the People of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> who were ſaved out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> to be a warning and caution unto them, leſt they ſhould fall after the ſame manner. Now the fall of the Angels, was a total falling away, and ſo was that of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the Wilderneſs, who though they did eat that ſpiritual Meat and drink that ſpiritual Drink, to wit, the Rock that followed them, and that Rock was Chriſt, as <hi>Paul</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly declared, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. yet were over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown in the Wilderneſs for their <hi>Idolatry, For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication,</hi> and other great Sins, they were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed of the Deſtroyer; ſo that in that day, God did ſwear againſt them, they ſhould not enter into his Reſt; ſee 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. throughout, compared with <hi>Jude,</hi> and 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. throughout. <hi>Fifthly,</hi> The Parable of the Seed that was ſown
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:55597:73"/>
in the ſtony and thorny Ground, that ſprang up, and afterwards whithered, did ſignifie (as Chriſt expreſly did expound it) ſome that believed for a time, and afterwards did fall away. And this Faith was not altogether a falſe Faith, otherwiſe it had not been blame-worthy in them, to have left it, or caſt it away; for it is rather com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable, than reproveable, to caſt away what is falſe and hypocritical, and not real: Nor doth it argue, that their Faith was not true or real, that it ſprang up in the ſtony and thorny Ground. For many that are real and ſincere Believers, at their firſt believing, feel their Hearts to be both ſtony and thorny Ground, and yet with diligence and labour, through the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and Grace of God, come to get their Hearts in proceſs of time, ſo changed and renewed, that they become good Ground, and bring forth good Fruit to the end: So the more ſtony and thorny that the Heart is, the more labour is to be uſed to make it good, which by the Grace of God may well be done. <hi>Sixthly,</hi> The Parable of the ten Virgins, five whereof were fooliſh, hath the ſame ſignification, for theſe five fooliſh Virgins had ſome Oyl in their Lamps, but not being wiſe to get enough, they ſpent what they had, and ſo their Lamps went out; for though they had Oyl in their Lamps (otherwiſe their Lamps could not have gone out) yet they had not in their Veſſels, as the wiſe Virgins had, and ſo when they were called at midnight, to meet the Bride-groom, they had no Oyl at all, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:55597:74"/>
in their Lamps, or Veſſels; ſee <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. from Verſe 1. to 12. <hi>Seventhly,</hi> It is expreſly ſaid, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18.24. and 26, 27. <hi>When a righteous Man turneth away from his Righteouſness, and commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth Iniquity, he ſhall die. And again, when the wicked Man turneth away from his Wickedness, and doth that which is lawful and right, he ſhall live.</hi> And <hi>Eighthly,</hi> The example of <hi>David</hi> is a moſt clear Inſtance, who fell from his Integrity, by theſe two great and capital Sins of <hi>Adultery</hi> and <hi>Murther,</hi> and brought Death upon him; and had not God renewed him again by Repentance, and reſtored him, he had dyed in his Sins, and periſhed; and this fall of his was total, though not final, becauſe God reſtored him before he dyed. But to ſay, as theſe Faith-publiſhers ſay and affirm, That <hi>no Men once ſanctified in the leaſt meaſure, can fall totally from their Sanctification, though committing Murder and Adultery, as was the caſe of</hi> David (ſee Cap. 17. Sect. 1. and Cap. 11.5. of their Confeſſion) <hi>nor from their Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,</hi> is not only a moſt falſe and pernicious Doctrin, but a moſt wonderful piece of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion. For if he that is both Murderer and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulterer in the very act, and remaining in that or theſe Sins, without Repentance for ſome time, are really Saints, and juſtified; then who may be ſaid not to be Saints? Or what difference is there betwixt the Saints, and no Saints, betwixt the godly and the wicked, good men and evil men? If a man that is both Murderer and Adulterer, be a real Saint, and a juſtified man, then the worſt
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:55597:74"/>
of men may generally believe they are true and real Saints, and ye cannot convince them of the contrary? For by what means can they be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced thereof? Tell them of their Sins, <hi>Lying, Stealing, Drunkenness, Swearing, Murther</hi> and <hi>Adultery,</hi> none of all this, according to this wicked Doctrin, doth prove them to be no Saints, or that they have not true Faith; and therefore if they die in theſe groſs Sins, they muſt go to Heaven immediately; becauſe they ſhall die in Faith, they ſhall die ſanctified and juſtified men; than which I know no greater Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, and daubing with untempered Morter, and ſewing Pillows under Peoples Arm-holes, like the falſe Teachers of Old, and prophecying ſmooth things unto People in their Sins, and flattering them, yea, imboldning and encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging them to Sin: And no doubt, many are wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully imboldned and encouraged to run into Sin, and exceſs of Sin by ſuch <hi>poyſonous Doctrin,</hi> that theſe falſe Teachers feed them with, that is like ſweet Poyſon, that though it be ſweet to the Fleſh, yet it kills the Soul: Doth not the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſay, <hi>The Soul that ſinneth ſhall die, and the Wages of Sin is death</hi>? And as every Sin doth in ſome meaſure kill the Soul, ſo great Sins, ſuch as <hi>Murder</hi> and <hi>Adultery,</hi> than which we can hardly ſuppoſe any greater (unleſs that unpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donable Sin of <hi>Blaſphemy</hi> againſt the holy Ghoſt) do wholly kill and deſtroy the Soul, inſomuch that if any ſuch Soul ever be ſaved, it muſt be by a new Creation, and renewing; and of this
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:55597:75"/>
                  <hi>David</hi> was well ſenſible, when, after God was pleaſed ſpiritually to viſit and awaken him again, he prayed unto God, ſaying, <hi>Create in me a clean Heart, O God, and renew a right Spirit within me,</hi> Pſal. 51.10. And thus according to theſe falſe Teachers, there is no mortal Sin, that any Soul once quickned in the leaſt degree, can commit; and the ſame Sin that is mortal in the unbeliever, is not mortal in him that once was a believer, as <hi>Murder, Adultery,</hi> yea, <hi>Incest,</hi> or worſe, is no mortal Sin, in one, and yet is a mortal Sin in the other. Doth not this looſe the reins to all ſorts of Wickedneſs, and make God a reſpecter of Perſons, and Faith a ſort of Proof, that though men, once having Faith, commit the worſt ſort of Sins, as <hi>Murder, Adultery, Inceſt, Rapine,</hi> yet their Faith is a ſort of proof unto them, that none of theſe Sins doth or can kill them? They are ſtill Saints for all this, and juſtified in the ſight of God; and if Saints, then good enough to be your Church-Members, yea, Members of the <hi>Independent</hi> or <hi>Congregational Church.</hi> Why? what doth hinder, but they are as real and law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Members of the Church as any others? And if Murderers and Adulterers, while ſuch, are ſtill Saints, and qualified to be your Church-Members, it is no wonder that your Church be large, and have a great number of Members. It is no great difficulty to be a Member of that Church, when a Murderer, an Adulterer can be a Member of it. Is this your pretence to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation? And why, ye eſtimate your Church
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:55597:75"/>
more holy than the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>? But is not your Church and Doctrin in this reſpect much more unholy? For the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> ſaith, <hi>All gross, or great Sins, as Fornication, Adultery, Murder, and the like, are really mortal Sins, in all that commit them, without reſpect of Perſons; and whoever commit ſuch Sins are fallen from their ſtate in Grace.</hi> And ſo ſaith the Scripture, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.9, 10. <hi>Be not deceived, neither Fornicators, nor Idolaters, nor Adulterers,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>ſhall inherit the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God.</hi> The which Kingdom of God is a ſtate of Grace, as well as of Glory. And here we ſee the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> maketh no diſtinction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt one that hath formerly believed, and one that hath not believed, but without diſtinction, or reſpect of Perſons, he concludeth in general againſt them all, that while ſuch, they cannot in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit the Kingdom of God. But according to this <hi>Westminſter</hi> and <hi>New-England</hi> Confeſſion of Faith, Fornicators, and Murderers, and Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers, that have at any time once believed, do ſtill inherit the Kingdom of God, to wit, a ſtate of Grace, which is, in a true ſenſe, the Kingdom of God, and is frequently ſo called in Scripture. And thus it doth moſt evidently appear, that their Doctrin in this particular is Antichriſtian, and contrary to the Doctrin of the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. And to ſay, that Murder or Adultery in him that hath once truly believed, is not a mortal, or killing Sin, but is a mortal Sin in him that hath not believed, is not only to make God a reſpecter of Perſons in the worſt ſenſe, but to
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:55597:76"/>
extenuate the Sin in the Believer, and to aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate it in the Unbeliever, contrary to the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures Teſtimony, which doth aggravate any Sin, that Men having once believed, fall into, more than in unbelievers, as is clear from 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.20, 21.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And as for the Scriptures, they bring in their ſaid Confeſſion, to prove their falſe Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin, let them be impartially examined, and they will be found to prove no ſuch thing; ſome of them being expreſly conditional, as that in 2 Pet. 1.10. <hi>For if ye do theſe things, ye ſhall never fall.</hi> Here it is only promiſed conditionally, but not abſolutely, that they ſhall not fall, to wit, <hi>if they give all diligence to add to their Faith Virtue,</hi> &amp;c. Verſe 5. And this ſerveth them not only from falling totally, but from falling inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitly or univerſally, ſo as not at all to fall; for he ſaith not, <hi>Ye ſhall not fall totally,</hi> But, <hi>Ye ſhall not fall.</hi> And there are many other Scriptures, that though they do not expreſly mention the Condition, yet do Imply it, and are to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded by other Scriptures that do expreſs it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It is readily and willingly granted, that there is a ſtate in <hi>Holiness,</hi> or <hi>Sanctification,</hi> that may be attained and grown up into, wherein men cannot fall away totally from a ſtate of Grace; but as they cannot fall away totally, ſo they cannot commit any groſs or great Sin, which in the Scripture phraſe, is commonly called <hi>Sin,</hi> to wit, a <hi>hainous Sin,</hi> or <hi>Crime,</hi> which <hi>John</hi> call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, <hi>A Sin unto Death,</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.16, 17. And
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:55597:76"/>
here he diſtinguiſheth betwixt a Sin unto Death, and a Sin that is not unto Death, <hi>viz.</hi> that doth not totally ſlay the Soul's Life, but woundeth it, and killeth only in part, as ſome ſmall wandring or evagation of mind, or giving way (through ſlackning the Watch) unto a vain Thought, for ſome ſmall time; ſomething of Anger, or Paſſion, upon ſome ſudden occaſion; ſomething of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying in Sufferings, or Services, or Knowledge, or in ſpiritual Attainments; ſomething of too forward and haſty Zeal, and divers like ſudden Motions, that a gracious and godly Soul may be tryed and afflicted with, that are as Thorns in the Fleſh-and do wound and afflict the Soul, but are not ſuffered to proceed ſo far, as to carry it forth into any ſecret or open groſs Crime, either inwardly in the Heart, or outwardly in Word or Deed. Hence both in the Old and New Teſtament, we find divers kinds and degrees of Sin, more or leſs heinous, and theſe expreſſed by divers both <hi>Hebrew</hi> and <hi>Greek</hi> Words: The more hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous are called, <hi>Iniquities, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ngodlineſs, Impiety, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nrighteouſneſs, Perverſeneſs, Rebellion</hi>; and others of an inferiour Nature, are called, <hi>Treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſes, Debts, Omiſſions, Faults,</hi> &amp;c. Now the leaſt kind or degree of Sin doth weaken and wound, yea, kill in part the Soul's ſpiritual Life, as when in the natural Body ſome Member is mortally wounded, and killed, and yet the whole Perſon is not ſlain thereby; but all groſs Sins, ſuch as <hi>Fornication, Adultery, Murder, Theft, Robbery,</hi> &amp;c. make havock, waſte and deſtroy
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:55597:77"/>
the Soul's Life, and kill the whole man, whom, notwithſtanding, God in his infinite mercy may and doth, at times, reſtore. For we read of no Sin unpardonable, but that of Blaſphemy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Holy Ghoſt, and doing deſpite to the Spirit of Grace. And ſuch who are come to this noble degree and ſtate of <hi>Sanctification,</hi> are deſcribed, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.2, 3. <hi>Bleſſed are they that keep his Teſtimonies, and that ſeek him with the whole Heart, they alſo do no Iniquity, they walk in his ways.</hi> And ſuch have their Calling and Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction made ſure unto them; ſuch are not meerly or barely Servants, nor Sons of the Bond-woman, but Sons of the Free-woman, and throughly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed and born of God, <hi>who doth not commit Sin, for his Seed remaineth in them,</hi> 1 John 3.9. <hi>And he cannot ſin, becauſe he is born of God.</hi> For indeed to him that is born of God, Sin is contrary to his new Nature, as much as Holineſs or Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs is contrary to the Devil's Nature, or as one contrary thing can be to another, as it is contrary to a Fiſh to live on dry Land, or for a Sheep or Dove to live in the bottom of the Seas. But whoever commit any groſs thing, as <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication, Murder, Adultery, Theft, Robbery, Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury</hi>; &amp;c. never arrived to this pure and perfect ſtate of Sonſhip, were but Servants, and not purely and perfectly Sons; and yet the ſtate of the Servant is a true and good ſtate in its place, and as faithfully improved, leadeth on infallibly to the ſtate of pure and perfect Sonſhip; and ſuch who have attained to this pure and perfect
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:55597:77"/>
ſtate of Sonſhip, can ſay with <hi>Paul,</hi> Gal. 4.31. <hi>So then Brethren, we are not Children of the Bond-woman, but of the Free.</hi> And with <hi>John,</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.19. <hi>They</hi> (to wit, ſuch who were not true Sons, but at beſt only Servants) <hi>went out from us, but they were not of us,</hi> &amp;c. To wit, Sons and Children of the Free-woman, or the Children of the New Covenant, they were only of <hi>Hagar,</hi> that ſignifieth the Law, or firſt Covenant. And to conclude, the Righteouſneſs and Holineſs of the firſt Covenant, may be totally fallen from, ſuch as was that of the Angels, who fell, and <hi>Adam</hi> the firſt man, he fell totally, and ſo may they who are not further advanced, than to bear the Image of him, the earthly <hi>Adam</hi>; but the Righteouſneſs and Holineſs of the New Covenant, (ſuch as they attain unto, who are throughly born of God, and are made Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comers and Conquerors, yea, <hi>more than Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors,</hi> as the Scripture phraſeth it, and are made conform to the Image of Chriſt, the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> the Lord from Heaven, heavenly) can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be fallen from, or loſt; ſuch having over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, are made Pillars in the Houſe of God, ſo as no more to go out, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.12. And to this ſtate only do all theſe places of Scripture relate, that hold forth and imply a ſure and abſolute ſtedfaſtneſs in Holineſs and Righteouſneſs. But who are thus far advanced, and who are not, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though infallible Signs and Marks of diſtinction may be given of theſe two ſo differing ſtates, God only infallibly knoweth, and they to whom
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:55597:78"/>
he doth reveal it: For it is God that muſt make known by the inward Revelation of his holy Spirit, who hath theſe marks, otherwiſe men may preſume to have them, when they have them not. And of theſe infallible Signs and Marks, ſome of them are to <hi>love God with the whole Heart, to love him purely and perfectly,</hi> to <hi>love him for himſelf,</hi> and to <hi>deſire to enjoy him,</hi> as he is a <hi>God of Holineſs, Purity</hi> and <hi>Righteouſneſs,</hi> more than for Gifts, or Comforts, or Rewards, that are of an inferiour Nature; to <hi>hate</hi> and <hi>fear Sin,</hi> more than all puniſhment for Sin; to have no inward inclination, or deſire to revenge In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries, but moſt willingly and heartily to <hi>forgive</hi> and <hi>bear</hi> them; to <hi>love Enemies,</hi> from the very inward ground and bottom of the Heart, and always to render <hi>good</hi> for <hi>evil,</hi> and <hi>bleſſing</hi> for <hi>curſing.</hi> Now he that is in the ſtate of a meer Servant, or Son of the Bond-woman, may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to practice all theſe things in Word and Deed, as outwardly, and may have many inward wreſtlings, and endeavours inwardly to bring his Heart to the inward Conformity of this moſt holy and ſpiritual Law; but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til he be more inwardly changed and renewed, and born again by a ſecond inward Birth, he cometh not up in Heart and Soul to this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Purity, but feels a ſecret defect within him, of this ſo perfect Righteouſneſs, that is wholly Evangelical.</p>

                  <pb n="147" facs="tcp:55597:78"/>4. Next as to that other Queſtion mentioned in the Title of this Chapter, <hi>viz.</hi> Whether it is true, <hi>That no man by any Grace of God given him in this Life</hi> (which includes all Grace given at preſent, or to be given at any time hereafter in this Life) <hi>can perfectly keep the Commandments of God, but doth daily break them, in Thought, Word and Deed.</hi> The Faith publiſhers of <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> and <hi>New-England</hi> do poſitively &amp; expreſly affirm it, in anſwer to Queſtion 149. larger <hi>Catech.</hi> and <hi>Cap.</hi> 16. <hi>Sect.</hi> 5. they farther ſay, <hi>That the beſt Works of the Saints, which proceed from the Spirit of God, as they are wrought by them, are defiled.</hi> The which Aſſertions have ſeemed ſo groſs to divers of their Church-Members, that they could not believe, that their Catechiſm and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of <hi>faith</hi> ſaid any ſuch thing, until I have got the Book, and both read &amp; cauſed them to read the ſame in their ſaid <hi>Catechiſm &amp; Confeſſion</hi> with their own Eyes, and then they were amazed and aſhamed; and indeed it is an aſtoniſhing Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin, eſpecially to ſay, <hi>That the good Works of God's holy Spirit are defiled in or by the Saints.</hi> It is ſuch a <hi>Chimera,</hi> or Contradiction, as to ſay, one and the ſame thing can have the perfect ſhape of a man, in all his parts and Members, without any defect or redundancy, as to ſay, a perfect Man, and yet alſo have the ſhape of a Dog, Aſs or Hog, at the ſame inſtant. For they ſay, <hi>As it is the Work of God, it is perfect; and as it is the work of Man, it is imperfect and Sin, and that to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally.</hi> For they do not mean, that one part of the
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:55597:79"/>
work is God's, and that is perfect, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther part is Man's, and that is imperfect; but that the whole work, as it is God's, is perfect, and as it is Man's, even the ſame whole work is defiled and imperfect, yea, Sin: What great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er piece of Nonſenſe and Contradiction can be imagined? as who would ſay, the Snow is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly white in one ſenſe, and yet black in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſenſe, or the Fire is hot in one ſenſe, but cold in another? And another as great an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdity they have affirmed, <hi>That theſe defiled and ſinful works of the Saints, God doth accept them, looking upon them in his Son, though in God's ſight, they are defiled and reproveable.</hi> Is not this to repreſent God (to ſpeak with reverence) as looking with a deceiveable Eye, as one that looks upon an Object, through a Green or Red Glaſs, it ſeemeth Green or Red, although it be not really ſo? and is it not to make Chriſt a meer Cloak to Sin, or blind to hide it from God's all-ſeeing Eye, or if not to hide it, yet for God to accept that for good and holy, which is not really ſo, and ſo to give a falſe judgment, and to call evil good, which God abhorreth? And is not this <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timonian</hi> like, who ſay, <hi>God ſeeth no Sin in them, though they Lye, Swear falſly, drink, drunk, steal, whore,</hi> &amp;c.? yea, <hi>Ranter</hi> like, for they ſay, <hi>God ſeeth no Sin in them, becauſe he looks upon them in Chriſt.</hi> But ſurely, in whomſoever Sin is, God and Chriſt ſeeth it, and cannot accept it, and Chriſt himſelf judgeth and condemneth all Sin. And as for their alledged Proofs from Scripture,

they are meerly wreſted and abuſed, as the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial Reader may perceive, with ſmall Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. The firſt place they cite in their larger <hi>Catechiſm,</hi> anſw. to Queſt. 149. is <hi>James</hi> 3.2. <hi>For in many things we offend all.</hi> But to this I anſwer, 1<hi>ſt.</hi> He doth not ſay, <hi>in all things,</hi> as theſe Faith-makers ſay, That <hi>all the beſt Works of the Saints are defiled, and they ſin in them all.</hi> 2<hi>dly,</hi> He doth not ſay, <hi>We ſhall, and muſt always offend, and can do no otherwiſe by any Grace of God, ſo long as we live.</hi> 3<hi>dly,</hi> It is to be conſidered, that the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> writes this Epiſtle in general to the twelve Tribes, who were not generally come to a ſtate of Perfection, and of ſuch it may be ſaid, they offend in many things, to wit, ſuch as are weak in Faith; and though he uſe the firſt Perſon of the plural Number, ſaying, <hi>We,</hi> this doth not prove that he doth underſtand himſelf, more than when he ſaith, Verſe 9, <hi>Therewith</hi> (to wit, the Tongue) <hi>curſe we Men.</hi> For <hi>James,</hi> to be ſure, was no ſuch Man, both to bleſs and curſe with the ſame Tongue or Mouth; for thus he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtulates with them, <hi>My Brethren, theſe things ought not ſo to be; Doth a Fountain ſend forth at the ſame place ſweet Water and bitter?</hi> The next place they cite, is <hi>John</hi> 15.5. <hi>For without me ye can do nothing.</hi> This proveth indeed, that no Man without the Grace of Chriſt can do any good; but it proveth not, that by the Grace of God he cannot do that which is good. Surely <hi>Paul</hi> was not of theſe Mens Faith, who ſaid, <hi>He was able through him that strengthned him,</hi> viz. Chriſt
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:55597:80"/>
                  <hi>to do all things.</hi> The next place they cite, is <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtes</hi> 7.20. <hi>There is no Man that doth good, and ſinneth not.</hi> To this it is anſwered; <hi>firſt,</hi> The Tranſlation doth as well bear it in the poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Mood, and may not Sin; the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Word being in the Future, which is at times put for the potential Mood, as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22.17. the Word in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> the Future: <hi>Secondly,</hi> It is readily granted, that there is a time or ſtate wherein Men generally do ſin, until a ſtate of Perfection be attained, which was not generally attained in the time of the Law, or Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for the Law made nothing perfect, and it is ſaid to be weak, although no doubt, there were ſome excellent and perfect Men in that time, but they did not attain to that Perfection by the Law, but by Faith in Chriſt. Another place they cite, is <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.5. <hi>And God ſaw that the Wickedneſs of Man was great in the Earth, and that every Imagination of the Thoughts of his Heart was only evil continually.</hi> Anſwer, This is very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinently here alledged, for it ſpeaketh only of that Generation of Men in the Old World, that were ſo exceedingly degenerated, that God was provoked to drown them with the deluge of Waters. But this doth not prove that it is ſo with the Saints; yea, <hi>Noah</hi> is expreſly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, Verſe 8. <hi>But</hi> Noah <hi>found Grace in the Eyes of the Lord.</hi> And verſ. 9. <hi>Noah was a juſt Man, and perfect in his Generation; and</hi> Noah <hi>walked with God.</hi> Another place they cite, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.9. Anſw. This place is as impertinently al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:55597:80"/>
as the former; for it is plain, that <hi>Paul</hi> there deſcribeth the condition of Men, both <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> as they are generally under the Law, and before they have Faith in Chriſt, as is clear from Verſe 19. <hi>Now we know, that what things ſoever the Law ſaith, it ſaith to them who are under the Law.</hi> But no where can it be found in Scripture, that there are none of theſe who are under Grace, that are righteous Men, and made free from Sin; but the contrary is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt, which expreſly teſtifieth of many righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and perfect Men, in their Generation, both before and after Chriſt came in the Fleſh, who pleaſed God, and were Men of good Hearts, and good Lives, and eſpecially <hi>Enoch</hi> is recorded, to have walked with God by Faith, of whom nothing blame worthy is mentioned in any one particular. And Chriſt ſpeaking of good men, ſaith, <hi>A good Tree cannot bring forth evil Fruit; and a good Man out of the good Treaſure of his Heart bringeth forth good things.</hi> But to apply theſe words, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.9. and the following words, to the Saints generally, as theſe Faith publiſhers do, ſutes more with <hi>Ranters</hi> than ſober <hi>Chriſtians</hi>; ſee and well conſider the words, from Verſe 10. to Verſe 19. <hi>There is none Righteous, no, not one; there is none that underſtandeth, there is none that ſeeketh after God; they are gone out of the way, they are together become unprofitable; there is none that d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

is full of Curſing and Bitterneſs; their Feet are ſwift to ſhed Blood, Deſtruction and Miſery are in their ways, and the way of Peace they have not known: there is no Fear of God before their Eyes.</hi> O ye <hi>Preſbyterian</hi> and <hi>Independent.</hi> Teachers of <hi>New-England</hi> and Old! How are ye not aſhamed to apply theſe words to all God's true Saints? Yea, to the beſt that ever lived in the beſt ſtate; and to bring them as a proof againſt the poſſibility of the Saints perfection in this Life: For if theſe Words do hold forth the beſt condition of the Saints, that ever they were in upon Earth, ye may as well ſay, all Men, yea, the worſt of Men are Saints, or the Saints are the worſt of Men, and there is no difference of Men at all, but all are equally <hi>wicked,</hi> equally <hi>ungodly, unholy, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous,</hi> which is indeed the plain and expreſs Language of <hi>Ranters, Libertines, Atheiſts,</hi> ſome of whom to the wounding and loathing of my Soul, I have heard ſo affirm: But we cannot grant unto you, that any of God's Saints are in that ſtate and condition deſcribed by <hi>Paul</hi> in that place, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. from verſe 9. to verſe 19, and 20. which Words he citeth out of ſome of the <hi>Pſalms</hi> of <hi>David,</hi> deſcribing the ſtate of Men, as they are in the fallen ſtate, and before the new Birth and ſpiritual Regeneration in Chriſt. But thus to confound theſe ſo differing ſtates, is to confound Heaven and Earth, yea, rather Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Hell, and to ſoppoſe a concord betwixt <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Darkneſs, God</hi> and <hi>Belial, Chriſt</hi> and <hi>Antichriſt.</hi> But let it be known unto you, we
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:55597:81"/>
can allow none of God's true Saints to be ſuch as are there deſcribed by <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 3. from verſe 9. to 19. But it doth too much ſute and quadrate with many of your ſuppoſed <hi>New-Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> Saints, who have moſt bitterly and falſly accuſed God's Servants, called in ſcorn <hi>Quakers,</hi> and moſt cruelly whipped, impriſoned and rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed many of them, and hanged ſome of them. It may be well enough ſaid of them indeed, <hi>Their Throat is an open Sepulchre; with their Tongues they have uſed Deceit; the poyſon of Aſps is under their Lips, whoſe Mouth is full of Curſing and Bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſs; their Feet are ſwift to ſhed Blood, deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and miſery are in their ways,</hi> &amp;c. Take this home to you, and blame not me for the Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, ſeeing ye make it your ſelves, and judge it to be your own condition.</p>
               <p n="5">5. And that the ſaid Doctrin, viz. <hi>The beſt of the Saints by the greateſt Grace of God given in this Life, cannot perfectly keep the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments of God, but doth daily break them in Thought, Word and Deed, and cannot be free from Sin for term of Life, but muſt ſin ſo long as they live, and are only ſet free from ſinning after Death,</hi> as they expreſly word it, in anſwer to Queſt. 89. larger Catechiſm, is not only warranted by any place of Scripture, but is moſt expreſly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to Scripture in many places, and is quite oppoſite to the very Nature of the New Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant and Goſpel Diſpenſation, and highly inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious to the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, tending to make void, and of none effect, the very end of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:55597:82"/>
and to fruſtrate his exceeding rich Grace; and alſo, it is moſt wofully injurious to Mens Souls, not only diſcouraging Men to preſs after Perfection in Holineſs, and Freedom from Sin, but tending to encourage them in ſloath and neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, to live and die in their Sins, and yet for all this be Saints, and immediately go to Heaven, although they both live and die in their Sins. And <hi>firſt,</hi> That the ſaid Doctrin is expreſly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to Scripture, ſee <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.18. <hi>Being then made free from Sin, ye became the Servants of Righteouſneſs.</hi> And Chap. 8.2, 3, 4, 5. and Verſe 9. and Chap. 6.6, 7, 8. <hi>John</hi> 8.32, 33, 34, 35, 36. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.13. <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 1.28. <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.19. Next, God did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe in the New Covenant, That he would pour <hi>clean Water</hi> upon his People, and they ſhould be <hi>clean from all their Filthineſs</hi> (<hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.25, &amp;c.) and he would <hi>write his Law in their Hearts,</hi> (<hi>Jer.</hi> 31.33.) and <hi>put his Spirit in their inward parts,</hi> and <hi>give them a Heart of Fleſh,</hi> and a <hi>new Heart,</hi> and a <hi>new Spirit,</hi> and <hi>put his Fear in their Hearts, that they ſhall not depart from him.</hi> And ſurely all this doth plainly hold forth a freedom from a total ſinning, and that daily in Thought Word and Deed. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The very end of Chriſt's coming was to ſave his People from their Sins, and not in their Sins, to put an end to Sin, and to finiſh Tranſgreſſion, and bring in everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Righteouſneſs, (<hi>Dan.</hi> 9.24.) and to do or effect that which the Law could not do, <hi>viz.</hi> to deſtroy Sin, and him who hath the power of Death, to wit, the Devil, <hi>that the Righteouſneſs
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:55597:82"/>
of the Law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Fleſh, but after the Spirit,</hi> Rom. 8.4. And the Lord ſaid unto <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 Cor. 12.9. <hi>My Grace is ſufficient for thee.</hi> But if it cannot pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve any Soul, one day, or hour, or moment, from ſinning actually in Thought, Word and Deed, it cannot be underſtood to be ſufficient; and <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid, <hi>Where Sin did abound, Grace hath much more abounded, and he was able through Christ that ſtrengthened him, to do all things:</hi> And Chriſt ſaid, <hi>his Yoke was eaſie, and his Burden was light:</hi> And <hi>John</hi> ſaid, <hi>His Commandments are not griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.</hi> But according to theſe Faith-publiſhers, Chriſt's Yoke is ſo heavy, that none can bear it; for what is it to bear his Yoke, but to keep his Commandments? And if they cannot be fulfilled by Men, and yet many Thouſands caſt into Hell-Fire for not fulfilling them, they are very grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous, which God forbid we ſhould think. And to ſay, that God requireth perfect Obedience from any part of Mankind, and yet giveth them no Ability to perform it, and puniſh them with Hell-Fire, for not doing that which is utterly and abſolutely impoſſible for them do, doth wofully reflect upon the Juſtice of God, and rendereth him not only ſevere and hard, but moſt Cruel and Tyrannical, worſe than <hi>Pharoah,</hi> to the poor <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> who required of them the tale of Brick, but gave them no Straw, and yet puniſhed them for not performing their Task. And <hi>laſtly,</hi> It is wofully injurious to Men, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage them to preſs after <hi>Perfection,</hi> or a perfect
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:55597:83"/>
freedom from Sin, to tell them, <hi>They cannot attain to it while they live.</hi> As if a Phyſician ſhould tell his Patient, <hi>For all the Phyſick I give thee, thou muſt ſtill remain diſeaſed, and never be healed, till Death heal thee.</hi> Or as if one ſhould ſay to a Traveller, that is going to ſuch a City, <hi>Thou ſhalt never reach to it whilſt thou liveſt in this World.</hi> Would not this greatly diſcourage them? And alſo it doth greatly encourage People to live in ſloath, and neglect to tell them, That though they live and die in their Sins, they ſhall be ſav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, if they have at any time once in all their Life believed in Chriſt Jeſus, that Faith will ſave them, though they live and die in their Sins. But we find that Chriſt fore-warned People, <hi>That if they died in their Sins, they ſhould not come whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he did go,</hi> John 8.21. And it was a fearful threatning that God denounced againſt that People, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 22.14. <hi>Surely this Iniquity ſhall not be purged from you, till ye die, ſaith the Lord God of Hoſts.</hi> But this falſe Doctrin of your Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers telleth you, <hi>It is no matter, though ye die in your Sins, yet ye ſhall immediately after Death go into Heaven, if ye have once believed.</hi> And the Scripture ſaith, <hi>Where the Tree falleth, there it ſhall be, whether towards the South, or towards the North, Eccleſ.</hi> 11.3. But according to this evil and corrupt Doctrin, though the Tree falleth North, it ſhall lie South. It is a fearful thing to teach or believe ſuch Doctrin in a matter of ſo great moment, ſo to ſmooth and daub with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempered Morter, and to flatter People, to tell
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:55597:83"/>
them, They not only may, but muſt live and die in their Sins, and yet immediately after Death, they ſhall go into Heaven, if once they have believed, their Faith ſecureth them, though they ſin daily in Thought, Word and Deed, and break all God's holy Commandments every day, and that there be no Health, nor Soundneſs in them. And indeed it is the great love that People have to Sin and Iniquity, that maketh them plead ſo earneſtly for it; for if they were weary of Sin, and did hate it, as a moſt cruel Tyrant, they would be glad to hear of a poſſibility of deliverance from Sin here in this World. And they that plead ſo much for Sin, to live and die in it, they plead for the Devil's Kingdom, and are his Servants and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters in that reſpect, and not the Servants and Miniſters of Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="6">6. But to clear the Doctrin of <hi>Perfection,</hi> as it is believed and preached by the People called <hi>Quakers,</hi> take theſe following conſiderations, (1ſt.) It is not an abſolute Perfection that we plead for, as attainable in this Life, as many of you have falſly accuſed us, and particularly <hi>Nath. Morton,</hi> in his <hi>New-England Memorial,</hi> pag. 157. as in many other things he doth moſt falſly charge that People in his ſaid Book; for we ſay, That the higheſt degree of Perfection attainable in this Life ought not to be ſit down and reſted in by any, but there ought to be a continual pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, by the beſt, in Holineſs, and in conformity to the Image of the Son of God, until the very
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:55597:84"/>
laſt moment of their Life; for Chriſt himſelf, who was free from all ſin, yet was perfected fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as he was Man, and did grow both in Grace and Stature; and <hi>Adam</hi> in the innocent ſtate, was ſtill to have increaſed in Virtue and Goodneſs, and then he would not have fallen, as he did. (2<hi>dly.</hi>) This perfection or freedom from Sin, and Poſſibility by the Grace of God, to keep his Commandments, we do not ſay it is attained by every one, at their firſt Converſion or entrance into the true Faith; but on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, we ſay, many true Believers, and who have a true meaſure of ſincerity towards God, are yet ſhort of that ſtate of a ſinleſs Perfection; and that it is not attained, but by great diligence, and wreſtling againſt ſin, through the ability of the Grace of God, and much watching and praying, and uſing all the means appointed of God, both inwardly and outwardly, to attain to that bleſſed Conqueſt and Victory over ſin. (3<hi>dly.</hi>) The moſt perfect in this Life, have need to watch and pray, that they enter not into Temptation; for as <hi>Adam,</hi> in Innocency, and in the Garden, did ſin, and by his ſin loſt his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency, ſo may Men that are inwardly come to this ſtate, if they be not duly watchful, ſin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Lord; therefore it is not the impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility of ſinning in all reſpects, that we plead for, but the poſſibility of not ſinning, and that by the Grace of God, and not otherwiſe. Altho' ſome may arrive to that ſtate in Holineſs, in
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:55597:84"/>
conformity to the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> that they nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſin, nor can ſin, in that ſenſe as the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture doth intend it, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.19. which doth at leaſt hold forth, that ſuch who are attained to this noble degree of Holineſs, they cannot com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit any groſs ſin (although in ſome things, not for want of love, but not having a full and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Knowledge in all things, they may a little fall ſhort, as a moſt loving Child, not perfectly underſtanding the Fathers mind in all things, may do a thing amiſs, and yet without breach of true Love to his Father, and therefore his Father doth not charge it upon him as a crime; and the like example may be of a moſt loving Wife, to her Husband, who retaineth her chaſte and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Love to her Husband, and yet may do ſome things not according to his mind; for as the Scripture ſaith, <hi>Love is the fulfilling of the Law</hi>; and he that faileth not in his Love, and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſeth not againſt the Law of Love, though in ſome caſe he may fall ſhort in underſtanding, God doth not impute it to be a crime unto him. (4<hi>thly</hi>) It is not temptations or motions unto ſin, that may ariſe either from the Devil, or the World without them, or from the natural and mortal part in them, that we plead a freedom from; for it is readily granted that ſuch Temptations may and do follow the beſt Men, and therefore they ought to watch againſt them, and reſiſt them, the which if they do, and that they no wiſe joyn and conſent to Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, it is not ſin unto them, according to
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:55597:85"/>
that ſaying of an Ancient, <hi>Non nocet ſenſus, ſi deſu Conſenſus,</hi> i. e. the ſenſe of the Temptation doth not hurt, if the conſent be not given unto it. (5<hi>thly.</hi>) The Seed or Principle of Evil, tho' it remain in the mortal, or natural part, &amp; at times move to evil Thoughts and Deſires, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet not being in any wife joyned nor conſented unto, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther outwardly in Word or Deed, nor inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the leaſt Thought or Deſire, or delight and love of the Heart yielded unto, nor obeyed, is not imputed to be Sin unto Men, who do not joyn to it, nor obey it, even as the Seed and Principle of God's Grace, of Truth, Holineſs, and Righteouſneſs, that is in the Hearts of wicked Men, and oft moveth in them to turn and convert them unto God from the evil of their ways, yet not being conſented, or yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto, nor obeyed by them, it is not in that caſe their Righteouſneſs, nor doth it make them in any reſpect righteous, unleſs they joyn and yield unto it, in true Obedience. <hi>(6thly.)</hi> It is not the ſame degree and ſtature of Perfection, that God requireth of every one, but accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to that meaſure and degree of Grace and Light that God hath imparted to every one, to ſome more, to others leſs, but to every one ſufficient to the preſent time and ſtate. For he that was faithful in the improving his two Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents to make them four, was accepted, although he made them not ten, as he that was faithful in his five, and made them ten, and they were both proportionally rewarded; hence we read of
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:55597:85"/>
good and holy Men, who are ſaid to be perfect in their Generation, according to the Light and Grace that God gave them, in their Day and Age. And the high Prieſt that had on his Breaſt the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rim</hi> and <hi>Thummim,</hi> that ſignifieth Lights and Perfections, was a Type of Chriſt, our great and only high Prieſt, who hath the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rim,</hi> that is Lights, and the <hi>Thummim,</hi> that is Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, and diſtributeth of theſe Lights and Perfections variouſly towards his Saints and Children, but to all ſufficiently. And ſo the degree of Perfection, and perfect Obedience ought to anſwer to the degree of Light and Grace that God giveth through Chriſt unto every one, and he who is faithful in that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, though he hath not the ſame equal degree and meaſure that another hath, is perfect in that reſpect; and the Child in the Child's ſtate is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, being faithful to the Grace and Light that is given him; and if he die in that ſtate, he is ſafe, and cannot periſh, as well as he that is a Man in Chriſt, and is come up to the ſpiritual ſtature and growth of a ſpiritual Man. So that Faithfulneſs in the Work and Service of God, is that which doth render a Man perfect in the ſight of God, according to the ability of Light and Grace received, whether in the ſtate of a Child, Young-man, or Elder in Chriſt. And thus I have gone through all the twelve parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars, which I charged on the four Teachers, whether <hi>Presbyterian</hi> or <hi>Independent,</hi> at <hi>Boston,</hi> and have given them not only my Aſſertions,

And it may be well allowed, that a Company, or Aſſembly of truly holy Men and Women, meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing together at certain Times and Places, that are known to People among whom they dwell, and calling together upon the Name of the Lord, and teaching, and inſtructing, and edifying one another, every one uſing his ſpiritual Gift of Miniſtration, whether in <hi>Praying</hi> or <hi>Prophecying,</hi> to the Edification of the whole, may be called a <hi>viſible Church,</hi> inſomuch that they appear in external or outward and bodily Works and Actions that are viſible. But as the Body with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Life or Spirit is dead, and cannot properly be called a Man, ſo a Church or Aſſembly of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, only profeſſing the true Religion (but having nothing of the true Life and Spirit of Chriſt, and whoſe outward and bodily Services and Works have no inward and ſpiritual Virtue and Life in them, which is that Salt that maketh them ſavoury, and doth recommend them unto God, ſo that he ſavoureth a ſweet ſavour in them) cannot be truly and juſtly accounted a true Church of Chriſt: For we no where find in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture any Society, or company of People called <hi>the Church of Chriſt,</hi> who had nothing but the
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:55597:87"/>
Profeſſion of the true Religion; and although <hi>Hypocrites,</hi> and meer <hi>Formaliſts</hi> did outwardly at times mingle or mix with ſincere <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> and did aſſume the ſame outward Profeſſion with them in former Ages, as ſuch were among the Churches of <hi>Corinth</hi> and <hi>Gulatia,</hi> &amp;c. Yet theſe Hypocrites and meer <hi>Formalists,</hi> who had only the Form, but had nothing of the Power and Life of true Religion, were no part of the true Church, no more than Chaff or Tares, that are mixed with Wheat, are any part of the Wheat, or Droſs that is mixed with Silver, is any part of the Silver, or old Leaven that is mixed with the new Dough, is any part of it. And therefore it ought to be the work of all the true Members of the true Church, to purge out the old Leaven, and to be a ſeparate People from all theſe that have only a Form and Profeſſion of Religion, but have nothing of the Power of it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Church of Chriſt is called his <hi>Body,</hi> frequently in Scripture, and every Member thereof is called a <hi>Member of Chriſt,</hi> and his Body is a <hi>living Body,</hi> and every Member a <hi>living Member</hi>; and that which maketh both the whole Body, and every Member thereof living, is Chriſt Jeſus the Life, living and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dwelling in every Member, and together with Chriſt, both the Father and the holy Spirit do dwell in every Member of the true Church, even as Chriſt promiſed it ſhould be, <hi>John</hi> 14.23. <hi>If a Man love me, he will keep my Words, and my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:55597:88"/>
will love him, and</hi> We <hi>will come unto him, and make our abode with him.</hi> And this WE, is the <hi>Father,</hi> the <hi>Son,</hi> and the <hi>holy Spirit,</hi> who are three, and one, indwelling in every true Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Church of Chriſt; and according to this, <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid to the believing <hi>Corinthians, Know ye not, that your Bodies are the Temples of the holy Ghost, which dwelleth in you.</hi> And the holy Ghoſt which dwelt in them, together with the Father and the Son, did work every good Work in them, and move them in all holy and religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Services and Performances, whether to <hi>Preach, Pray,</hi> or <hi>give Thanks,</hi> or to <hi>meditate</hi> and <hi>wait upon the Lord in ſilence</hi>: And they knew by the <hi>inward Teaching</hi> and <hi>Revelation</hi> of God's holy Spirit, the proper and fit times, when to ſpeak, and when to be <hi>ſilent,</hi> when to <hi>preach,</hi> and when to <hi>pray,</hi> and when to <hi>begin,</hi> and when to <hi>make an end</hi>; they had no Hour-glaſs to meaſure out the Time unto them, nor an outward Bell hanging in a Steeple, to call them together, but the Goſpel-Bell did ring and ſound in their Hearts, and this gathered them together in a living way and manner; and of this the outward Bells, (<hi>Ex.</hi> 28 34, 35) that did hang at the High-Prieſt's Garment, with the Pomegranats, were Types: And this is the living Word, even Chriſt whoſe inward Voice and Call in the Soul and Heart, giveth a joyful ſound to that Ear which is opened to hear it; and of ſuch it is written, <hi>Bleſſed are they that know the joyful ſound, they ſhall walk, O Lord, in the Light of thy Countenance,</hi> Pſal 89.15.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="167" facs="tcp:55597:88"/>4. Moreover the true Church, and every Member thereof, is ſaid to be of Chriſt's Fleſh, and of his Bones, and they two are one Fleſh, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.30, 31. And they are one Spirit, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.17. For Chriſt he is both the Head and Life of the Church, which is his Body, from whom the whole Body fitly joyned together, and compacted by that which every Joynt ſupplyeth, according to the effectual working (the Greek hath it, <hi>Energia</hi>) in the meaſure of every part, maketh increaſe of the Body, unto the edifying of it ſelf in Love, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.16. And that which thus knitteth all the Members both unto <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the Head, and one unto another, is the Spirit, and the Unity of the Spirit is the Bond of Peace; for by one Spirit they are all baptized into one Body, and do all drink into one Spirit: And this is the true gathering of a Church, or Churches of Chriſt, that is far beyond all Profeſſion of true Religion, or outward Signs, or Ceremonies, as that of <hi>water Baptiſm,</hi> which <hi>Presbyterians</hi> and others uſe to Initiate or enter People into their Church, or outward Covenants, and Contracts or Bonds, which theſe called <hi>Independents</hi> uſe to initiate or enter People into their Church, all which outward things are but Mens Inventions, as they are now uſed, whereby to gather, and make up Churches: And all this is but Mans ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering and work, made Things, Likeneſſes and graven Images of heavenly things, which the Lord hath forbidden, ſaying, <hi>Thou ſhalt not make to thy ſelf any graven Image, nor the likeness
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:55597:89"/>
of any thing in Heaven above,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Exod.</hi> 20. For whatever Men make, or ſet up, whether it be Church, Ordinance, or Service, without the Spirit and Power of God, inwardly moving, aſſiſting, teaching, leading, guiding and order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them ſo to do, is but Man's work, a thing of Man's making; and all ſuch made Things, made Faiths, made Churches, made Worſhips, made Ordinances, without the Spirit and Power of God inwardly revealed, are to be aboliſhed, ſhaken and removed, and the Voice of God will do it, whoſe Voice of Old did ſhake <hi>Mount Sinai,</hi> and the Lord hath ſaid, <hi>Yet once more I ſhake not the Earth only, but the Heavens alſo.</hi> And this Voice of the Lord uttered from Heaven, hath both ſhaken, aboliſhed, and removed many things of Mens making already, and in the Lords due time, will remove them all; and every Plant that is not of the Father's planting, he will pluck it up and throw it away. And this is a warning unto you, O ye Churches and People of <hi>New-England,</hi> altho' <hi>Babylon</hi> like, ye ſit as a Queen, or have at leaſt ſo ſate ſome few Years ago, and did ſay in your Heart, <hi>ye ſhall ſee no Widdowhood,</hi> and have preached it as Doctrin, that <hi>the ſounding of God's Voice from Heaven, is althogeter ceaſed in theſe days</hi>: Let this be told unto you, it hath not ceaſed to ſound, but ſtill doth, and ſhall, and the ſound of it ſhall not only ſhake, but utterly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move, undo, and deſtroy all your <hi>Babyloniſh build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings</hi>: And this the Lord will do, not by Might, nor Power (<hi>viz.</hi> of man) but by his own Spirit;
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:55597:89"/>
and the time haſtneth, and bleſſed ſhall he be who receiveth warning, and hearkneth unto the counſel of the Lord; he who hath Ears to hear, let him hear.</p>
               <p n="5">5. And the true Church is in God the Father, and in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.1. And it is built upon Chriſt, that ſure Foundation, and Rock of Ages, whom <hi>Peter</hi> confeſſed unto, which Fleſh and Blood hath not revealed unto him, but the Father in Heaven: And upon this Rock ſo confeſſed, and ſo known and underſtood, which Fleſh and Blood hath not revealed, but the Father in Heaven, is the true Church built. And this is more than a Profeſſion of the true Religion: For it is not every one that profeſſeth the true Religion, to whom the Father in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven hath revealed the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, as he did unto <hi>Peter,</hi> and as he doth unto every true and faithful Believer, and Confeſſor of Chriſt. And the true Church that is built on this Rock, and every Member thereof, they are not only hearers and profeſſors of the Words and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin of Chriſt, but they are doers of them: But they who do not, although they both hear and ſay, they are fooliſh Builders, and build upon the Sand; and ſuch are all theſe viſible Churches, who have no other thing to qualifie them, but to profeſs the true Religion. Now, to profeſs the true Religion, carrieth a two-fold ſenſe, one is, that the Religion which People profeſs, they call, or profeſs it to be the true Religion; and in this ſenſe, every one that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:55597:90"/>
any Religion at all (if he be in earneſt) profeſſeth the true Religion; that is, he eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth or profeſſeth his Religion to be ſuch. The other ſenſe is, that the Religion that is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed, is indeed the true Religion, and is not only ſo called, or profeſſed: And according to this ſenſe, your viſible Churches, whether <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian</hi> or <hi>Independent,</hi> are no true Churches: For the Religion ye profeſs, is not the true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion of Chriſt Jeſus, which he, and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, the Evangeliſts, and Apoſtles did teach, as I have already proved in many weighty par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars, yea, in Fundamentals, and in the very Foundation it ſelf, which is Chriſt Jeſus, on which the true Church is built, and every Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber thereof. But ye who ſay, <hi>All inward divine Revelation of Christ is ceaſed</hi>; ye build not on Chriſt, but on a meer Hear-ſay, and Hiſtorical report of him: For how can ye build on him, when ye have no belief that Chriſt is nearer unto you, than in ſome remote place beyond the Skies? Can the Walls of the Houſe be built on a Foundation that is altogether remote from it? Muſt not the Houſe and the Foundation be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately joyned together? And muſt not this Foundation be ſeen, and felt by every Member? And is not this incomparably more than the beſt Profeſſion of true Religion? O ye blind Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the Blind! How doth my Soul pity you, and the poor People more eſpecially, who are led by you, and whom ye are ſtill ſeeking to lead, until both ye and they fall into the Ditch;
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:55597:90"/>
and ye ill deſerve your Wages, and the many Hundreds, yea, Thouſands of Pounds, that poor People pay Yearly unto you, and work ſore and hard to feed you, and cloath you, and your Wives and Children, to Luxury and Wanton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, many of you, while in the mean time, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der colour and pretence of feeding the Souls of the People, ye famiſh and ſtarve, yea, poyſon and kill them with your falſe Doctrin, as I have, through God's aſſiſtance ſufficiently made ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, and I hope yet more to make appear, as I have occaſion given unto me.</p>
               <p n="6">6. And Chriſt Jeſus, the living, elect, preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Corner-ſtone, the ſure Foundation is laid in <hi>Zion,</hi> and that <hi>Zion</hi> is not only the heavenly <hi>Zion</hi> above, but the Church and People of God on Earth; and Chriſt Jeſus is one both in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven without us, and alſo within us, even the Man Chriſt Jeſus, the ſame that took hold of the Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and is the Son of <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> according unto that Seed, and he is exalted in heavenly Glory in that ſame Seed and Nature, in the whole and intire and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Nature of Man, in Soul and Body, having put off nothing that he had upon Earth; but theſe Weakneſſes and Infirmities which he did take on him for our ſake, even Jeſus of <hi>Nazareth,</hi> he who was crucified for our Sins, and roſe again for our Juſtification, who was dead, and is alive, and lives for evermore; and he who by true Faith is joyned to the Spirit of Chriſt, by the ſame he is joyned both to Chriſt in him, and
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:55597:91"/>
alſo to Chriſt in Heaven, and alſo to all the Saints in Heaven, and the innumerable company of Angels, and Spirits of juſt men made perfect, and alſo unto the God and Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt; and both God and Chriſt are not only in remote places, and Heavens without us, but alſo in us, and in all his Saints, as he hath ſaid, <hi>Jer.</hi> 23.23, 24. <hi>Am I a God at Hand, ſaith the Lord, and not a God afar off? Do not I fill Heaven and Earth? Saith the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. And as to the <hi>Government,</hi> and <hi>Governors,</hi> or <hi>Rulers</hi> of your viſible Churches, both <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian</hi> and <hi>Independent,</hi> it is of the ſame Nature with your viſible Churches, the only qualification of them being an outward profeſſion of <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Religion, and an outward Call (which ye are all at a loſs, where to begin it, as I have already proved, Cap. 4.) accompanied with ſome na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural or acquired Gifts and Abilities of Letter-learning, reaching no further than the Letter of the Scripture at beſt, and oft, or for moſt part not that; for ye preach not the Letter in the form of ſound words of Scripture, but have ſo mingled it with your Gloſſes, and wreſted Senſes and Meanings, and Words of men's wiſdom and intentions, that it is but little of the very Letter ye preach. But if ye did preach the Letter, and have not that infallible and unerring Spirit of Chriſt, which was in the true Miniſters of Chriſt in former Ages, and is now in his true Miniſters in this Age, ye are but at beſt Miniſters of the Letter, and not Miniſters of the Spirit, and
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:55597:91"/>
therefore not Miniſters of the New-Teſtament. And what is the uſe and end of your Government but to keep poor People in Bondage under you, and your falſe Doctrin? And if they do not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it, but witneſs againſt it, then ye caſt them out of your Synagogues, and yet then will force Maintenance from them, as many of you have done. And when ye had Power with the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates to inſtigate and ſtir them up to perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute honeſt Diſſenters, to Whip, Stock, Impriſon, ſpoil Goods, cut off Ears, and alſo to put to Death (for teſtifying againſt your falſe Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrins) from your falſe and fallible Spirit, I ſay, both falſe and fallible: For ſeeing ye do not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs to be taught, led and guided by the infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible Spirit of Chriſt, which was in the Prophets and Apoſtles, and in all true <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> if ye have not this Spirit, your Spirit is not only fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible, but falſe, to wit, the Spirit of this World; For there are but two Spirits that do teach, lead and guide all men on Earth, the one is, that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erring, true and infallible Spirit of Chriſt, which leadeth all God's true Children, and the other the Spirit of this World, which is the very Devil himſelf, the God of this World, that lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth all Unbelievers and Ungodly Perſons in the World; and this Spirit is not only fallible, but falſe, continually leading into Error, as the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Truth leadeth into all Truth.</p>
               <p n="8">
                  <pb n="174" facs="tcp:55597:92"/>8. And how are ye not aſhamed to cite (ſee <hi>Confeſ. cap.</hi> 30. <hi>ſect.</hi> 1.) <hi>Iſa.</hi> 9.6, 7, <hi>Acts</hi> 20.17. <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.18. for your Government, and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors and Elders of your Churches? Becauſe it is ſaid, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 9.6, 7. <hi>The Government is upon his Shoulders</hi>; to wit, Chriſt Jeſus? Doth it there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore follow it is upon yours? Or can any be Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors or Rulers in the Church under him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out he himſelf, and his holy Spirit, Power and Life, which hath the heavenly Authority in it, be known inwardly revealed, which ye deny? Was not the Government in the Apoſtles days alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether derived from the Power and Spirit of Chriſt in them? but yours is quite another thing; by your own Confeſſion, ye have not that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible Spirit, nor the inward Revelation of it. And if ye derive it from the Letter, ſo may any body elſe, as well as ye, and ſay, becauſe they have the Letter, they are Rulers and Governors of Churches. And as to theſe Elders, menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned <hi>Acts</hi> 20.17. They were ſuch whom the holy Ghoſt had made Overſeers, as is expreſly affirmed of them, Verſe 28. But this ye cannot in truth ſay, who deny all pretence to inward divine Revelation, which they had. Nor doth <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.18. make any thing at all for you, but againſt you: Chriſt ſaid to the Apoſtles, <hi>All Power in Heaven and in Earth is given unto me; go ye there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore and teach all Nations.</hi> But when ſaid he ſo unto you? Or when gave he you ſuch Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion? Or ſuppoſe ye had ſuch Commiſſion, ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ye are very unfaithful unto it, who creep each
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:55597:92"/>
of you into a Houſe or Town, and there only pretend to teach a few that come to hear you. So did not the Apoſtles, but travelled from place to place, and from one Nation, City and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try to another, and had no certain dwelling-place by virtue of their ſaid Commiſſion; but ſo do not ye, but commonly keep to one place, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs a fatter Benefice, or more yearly Sallary and Hire invite you to another. Will nothing ſerve your turn but the ſame Commiſſion, which Chriſt gave the Apoſtles? And if ye have the ſame Commiſſion, are not ye alſo Apoſtles? A charge which ſome of you have laid to us. But why do ye not mind the other part of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, and apply that unto you? <hi>Acts</hi> 1.4, 8. <hi>And being aſſembled with them, he commanded, that they ſhould not depart from</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>but wait for the Promiſe of the Father, which</hi> (he ſaith) <hi>ye have heard of me,</hi> Verſe 8. <hi>But ye ſhall receive Power after that the Holy Ghoſt is come upon you, and ye ſhall be Witneſſes unto me, both in</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>and in all</hi> Judea, <hi>and in</hi> Samaria, <hi>and unto the utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most part of the Earth</hi>? And though ſome of you in <hi>New-England,</hi> have made ſome ſhow of Preaching to the <hi>Indians,</hi> and to have convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them, and got great ſums of Mony out of Old <hi>England</hi> on that account. Alas! to what have ye converted them? Is it not very manifeſt, they are generally nothing better than when they were called <hi>Heathens,</hi> but are for moſt part rather worſe? Which of them all have ye turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from Darkneſs to Light, and from the Power
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:55597:93"/>
of Satan to God, and to know God and Chriſt by his Power and Spirit, to rule in them? Nay, alas! ye know it not in your ſelves, and preach againſt it, and therefore ye are not like to be Inſtruments to bring others to know it. And if ye ſay, Ye are the Succeſſors of the Apoſtles, and therefore the ſame Call, which he gave un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, he doth give unto you. Ye muſt firſt prove and demonſtrate it, that ye ſucceed them in the ſame Spirit, Power, Light and Life, and in the ſame Holineſs and Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Life, as well as in Profeſſion, before ye ought to be believed; but the contrary in all theſe reſpects is manifeſt. Nor can ye ſhew your Line of Succeſſion, but from the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and her Popes and Biſhops, which ye have called <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> in your <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of Faith,</hi> Cap. 25. Sect. 6. as is formerly obſerved in Cap. 4.</p>
               <p n="9">9. And as concerning the viſibility of the true Church, as it hath been granted, that the true Church is oft viſible, and doth viſibly appear in the Face of the World, as a City ſet upon an Hill, and doth make a viſible and outward Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of her Faith in Chriſt Jeſus, and love to him, both in good Words, and good Works, yet it is not any thing meerly outward and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, that doth infallibly prove or demonſtrate her to be the true Church, or can make her known to People: But it is the ſame inward Light, Spirit and Power of God inwardly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed, that doth make known both Chriſt
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:55597:93"/>
the Head, and the true Church, which is his Body, and every true Member thereof: And without the Light and Spirit of Chriſt inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhining, and revealing, both Chriſt and his Church is unknown unto Men, but by the ſame is well known, even as Chriſt ſaid unto his Diſciples, <hi>John</hi> 15.18. <hi>If the World hate you, ye know that it hated me before it hated you.</hi> Now, whence is it that the World both hateth Chriſt, and his Church? Becauſe it knoweth them not. And <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.9. <hi>As unknown, and yet well known</hi>; to wit, well known to the Children of the Light, who dwell in the Light, and ſee and judge of things, and Men in the Light; but to them who are in Darkneſs, and are Darkneſs, unknown, and therefore hated and perſecuted by them.</p>

               <p n="1">1. AS for the term, or word <hi>Sacrament,</hi> it is no where to be found in all the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Tranſlation of the Bible received among <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants,</hi> nor is there any Word either in the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew,</hi> or <hi>Greek,</hi> that doth properly anſwer unto it, unleſs they will tranſlate the <hi>Greek</hi> Word that ſignifieth <hi>Myſtery,</hi> to ſignifie a <hi>Sacrament,</hi> as the old <hi>Latin</hi> hath it in <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.32. <hi>Hoc est magnum Sacramentum,</hi> i. e. This is a great Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament; for which our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Tranſlation read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth more properly, this is a great Myſtery. But if <hi>Sacrament</hi> ſignifie <hi>Myſtery,</hi> then there muſt be as many <hi>Sacraments</hi> as <hi>Mysteries</hi>; and Faith it ſelf is a Sacrament at that rate, and true Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Prayer, and every other Religious mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and thing, all which are holy Myſteries. And they who ſay, there are two Sacraments have borrowed theſe two out of the ſeven, profeſſed by the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> having caſt off, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected five of the ſeven, for which the ſaid Church doth accuſe theſe latter Churches of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criledge, and ſpiritual Robbery, to aboliſh and
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:55597:94"/>
take away five of the ſeven Sacraments, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther indeed the ſixth alſo, ſeeing they believe it only to be but a Figure, to wit, that called the <hi>Euchariſt</hi>: And to ſay the truth, they have not one whit more probability, but rather leſs, for the two Sacraments that they have reſerved, than for the other five that they have rejected: And they have no cauſe to accuſe the People call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Quakers,</hi> of Sacriledge, for denying theſe two, until they clear themſelves of Sacriledge for denying five, and give better grounds for reſerving theſe two, than as yet they have given.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And as for <hi>Infants Baptiſm,</hi> and ſprinkling a Child of eight days, or more or leſs, on the Fore-head, and call it <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> it hath no foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in all the Scripture, neither of Precept nor Practice, as will eaſily appear, by conſidering the places of Scripture they cite for it. And firſt, for <hi>Sprinkling</hi> on the Fore-head, inſtead of <hi>Dipping,</hi> they cite <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.10. to 22. But this Sprinkling was not of Water, but of Blood; and we do not read that it was only on the Fore-head; and the Cups and Veſſels that were ſprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with Blood or Water, were ſprinkled all over, and not in one ſingle place. And why did <hi>John</hi> baptize Chriſt by dipping into Water, and others that he baptized, if ſprinkling on the Fore-head was ſufficient in that day? Next, as to the baptizing of Infants, they cite for it, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.9. <hi>Where God commanded</hi> Abraham <hi>that every Man child of his Posterity ſhould be Circumciſed, and

therefore every Infant of one, or both the believing Parents are to be ſprinkled with Water.</hi> But this Conſequence is meerly begged, but nothing proved. For the firſt, we find an expreſs com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand to <hi>Abraham</hi>: For the ſecond, we find nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Command nor Practice in all the Scripture, nor was the practice of baptizing Infants in uſe, for an hundred of Years, and more, after the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles days, among Profeſſors of <hi>Christianity.</hi> And let it be granted, that Infants have a right to the Grace ſignified by Water Baptiſm, it doth not therefore follow, that the Figure or Sign belongeth unto them, becauſe they have alſo a right to Chriſt's Body and Blood, and yet they confeſs, the Supper is not to be adminiſtred unto them. The next place they cite, is <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 2.11, 12. where <hi>Circumciſion</hi> and <hi>Baptiſm</hi> are joyned together, but neither the Circumciſion, nor the Baptiſm there mentioned, is outward, as is clear, eſpecially of Circumciſion, that is ſaid, <hi>to be made without Hands</hi>; and therefore it is not the outward of the Fleſh, but the inward of the Heart; and ſo is alſo the Baptiſm there menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, verſe 12. <hi>Buried with him in Baptiſm, wherein alſo you are riſen with him, through the Faith of the operation of God.</hi> Ye ſee here is nothing of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Water: Nor are all they who are bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized with outward Water, either buried with Chriſt, or riſen with him, but many ſtill alive in old <hi>Adam,</hi> and that too generally. The next place they cite, is <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.19. But this ſaith nothing of <hi>Water,</hi> and if it were granted that
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:55597:95"/>
Water-Baptiſm is underſtood, as it neither is, nor ought to be granted, yet it will not prove that Infants ſhould be any more baptized than taught, ſeeing <hi>teaching</hi> and <hi>baptizing</hi> are joyned together. Another place they cite, is <hi>Luke</hi> 18.15, 16. where Chriſt biddeth to <hi>ſuffer little Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to come unto him, and forbid them not,</hi> and that <hi>he bleſſed them, and laid his hands upon them,</hi> we read in Scripture; but that he baptized them either with dipping or ſprinkling, we read not, but on the contrary it is expreſly ſaid, <hi>That Jeſus himſelf baptized none,</hi> to wit, <hi>with Water,</hi> ſee <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.2. Their laſt place they cite, is <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.16. <hi>If the Root be holy, ſo are the Branches</hi>; but this doth not prove that Infants are more to be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, than to have that called the Supper adminiſtred unto them: And theſe Branches mentioned by <hi>Paul</hi> in that place, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.16. were really the unbelieving <hi>Jews,</hi> that becauſe of their Unbelief were broken off at that time, yet the Root being holy, to wit, <hi>Abraham,</hi> and the promiſed Seed, <hi>Paul</hi> had hope of their converſion, as many as did belong to God's election, as he expreſſeth it, verſe 28. and theſe were not the immediate Children of <hi>Abraham,</hi> but forty Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations after <hi>Abraham,</hi> and <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi>; and therefore this Scripture ſaith as much for the aged unbelieving Children of unbelieving Parents, if they have deſcended from any of their Fore-Fathers, upwards of forty Generations, that were Believers; and if up to forty, why not up to ſixty, and further? Yea, to <hi>Noah,</hi>

who is the common Father of all Men, with whom God eſtabliſhed his Covenant, and with his Seed after him, until the end of the World, that all his Seed through Chriſt, might receive the benefit of the ſame, unleſs they do wilfully reject it; of which I have ſaid ſomething alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy in Chap. 6.</p>
               <p n="3">3. And as for <hi>Water-Baptiſm</hi> in general, we ſay, it did only properly belong to <hi>John</hi>'s Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry and Diſpenſation, and is expreſly contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſtinguiſhed from the Baptiſm of Chriſt, both by <hi>John,</hi> and alſo by Chriſt himſelf; for <hi>John</hi> did <hi>baptize with Water unto Repentance,</hi> but Chriſt who cometh after <hi>John,</hi> and was before him, who is more worthy than <hi>John, he baptizeth with fire, and with the Holy Ghoſt</hi>; and no doubt there was a ſpiritual bleſſing and Grace conveyed unto People, by <hi>John</hi>'s Baptiſm, while it ſtood in force; for God never ordained any outward thing, but as it was rightly done, in its day and ſeaſon, it had ſome ſpiritual bleſſing accompany<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, as all the Sacrifices and Services of the Law: And if any were raiſed up by the Lord, as <hi>John</hi> was, and could prove, and inſtruct their being ſent to baptize with Water, as he was, theſe to whom they ſhould be ſent, ought gladly to receive it; but to do it by bare imitation, or a meer pretended Call, which they cannot prove to be either mediate or immediate, is great pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, yea, ſuperſtition; and to call that a Command of God, which he hath given them no command to practiſe, is to ſet up the Precepts of
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:55597:96"/>
Men in the room of God's Commandments, as the Phariſees did of old, and is a taking of his Name in vain, for which he will not hold them guiltleſs. And they can never prove, by all their art and skill, that <hi>Water-Baptiſm</hi> is commanded by Chriſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.18, 19. for all God's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands and precepts, eſpecially of publick inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, relating to the Church, are expreſs, in ſo many expreſs Words, and are not left to be gathered by uncertain and doubtful Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences. When God ſent <hi>John</hi> to baptize with Water, Water was expreſſed; but in the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles Commiſſion to baptize, no mention is made of Water, nor no words of Inſtitution commanded to be uſed, but the command is, <hi>Go, teach and baptize all Nations into the Name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost.</hi> And the Name of either the Father, or the Son, or the Holy Ghoſt, is moſt frequently, if not always uſed in Scripture, to ſignifie Power and Life, as <hi>the Name of the Lord is a strong Tower: Thy Name is as Ointment poured forth,</hi> &amp;c. And whereas they object, firſt, <hi>That the Apostles could not bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize with the ſpiritual Baptiſm.</hi> I anſwer, yea; they could Inſtrumentally and Miniſterially, as well as they could convert, and beget Sons and Daughters unto God; for they were Mini<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſters of the Spirit, and did miniſter of the Spirit, both in <hi>Preaching,</hi> and <hi>Prayer,</hi> and <hi>laying on of Hands,</hi> although God only was the principal worker and Author. Next, they object, <hi>That</hi> Peter <hi>and</hi> Paul, <hi>and ſome others, baptized ſome
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:55597:97"/>
with Water, and that Christ was baptized with Water.</hi> But none of theſe prove what they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, for Chriſt was baptized by <hi>John,</hi> and alſo he was circumciſed according to the Law, and <hi>Paul</hi> circumciſed <hi>Timothy</hi>; and the Apoſtles ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally in that day thought fit both to uſe, and tolerate the uſe of <hi>Water-Baptiſm,</hi> that belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to <hi>John,</hi> and divers other things of the Law, which by permiſſion, for a time, and not by any Goſpel ſtanding Commiſſion; otherwiſe <hi>Paul</hi> would never have ſaid, he was not ſent to bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize, but to preach the Goſpel; nor would he have thanked God that he had baptized ſo few: For it were ſtrange to think that <hi>Paul</hi> would thank God, that he did not ſo fully obey a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel precept. In ſhort, if theſe who are ſo zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous for <hi>Water-Baptiſm,</hi> were cordially zealous, for the inward and ſpiritual Baptiſm, they might be the more born with, as Men bear with Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, that uſe Likeneſſes and Figures of things, that ſute moſt with the age and ſtate of Children, and Charity might be allowed them in that caſe, to be as Children or Babes in Chriſt, if they did hunger and thirſt after Righteouſneſs, and did wait for the inward appearance and coming of Chriſt's Kingdom, and the Revelation of it in their Hearts, as ſome ſuch there may be. But theſe, who altogether are for the outward Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm and Supper, and deny wholly the inward and ſpiritual Baptiſm and Supper of Chriſt, which is only known and received by the holy Spirit's inward Revelation, no Charity can
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:55597:97"/>
be allowed unto them, to judge them true <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians</hi> in any degree, not ſo much as Babes, but altogether, for the time, Hypocrites and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maliſts.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Next, concerning the Supper: We grant that Chriſt had an outward Supper with his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, when he did eat the Paſcal Lamb with them; and this was a real Supper, and not like that which ye now uſe, that is neither ſubſtantial Supper nor Dinner, being only a little crumb of Bread, ſcarce ſo big as a Nut, and a ſpoonful of Wine, or two, which hath little outward Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and no inward and ſpiritual Signification unto you, as ye uſe it, while ye altogether deny, that the Saints are partakers of the ſubſtance of Chriſt, or that Chriſt really and ſubſtantially dwelleth in his Saints; and while ye alſo deny all inward Revelation of him in theſe latter Ages, Your Supper is a meer ſhadow, and none of Chriſt's Supper, nor of his Inſtitution. For when Chriſt did ſup with his Diſciples, in the Night wherein he was betrayed, he began with the Cup, and bleſſed, or gave thanks, and ſaid, <hi>Take this, and divide it among your ſelves.</hi> And next he took Bread, and bleſſed, or gave thanks, and brake it, and gave unto them, ſaying, <hi>This is my Body, this do in Remembrance of me:</hi> Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe after Supper he took the Cup, ſaying, <hi>This Cup is the New-Teſtament in my Blood, drink ye all of it,</hi> Luke 22.14. to 20. So we ſee, he uſed the Cup twice, and began and ended with it, but ſo do not ye; and though ye ſeem greatly
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:55597:98"/>
to blame the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> for not giving the Cup to the People, but only the Bread, and charge them with mutilating, or diſmembring the Inſtitution; if ſo, do not ye the ſame in part? Seeing ye uſe the Cup but once, and Chriſt uſed it twice, and began with it, but ſo do not ye. And ſeeing ye ſay <hi>Ye have not that infallible Spirit that Chriſt had, and gave to the Apoſtles</hi>; and that we find you wholly ignorant of Chriſt's Body, and that ye have no diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it, nor no taſte and ſavour of his Fleſh, which is Meat indeed, nor of his Blood, which is Drink indeed, and know not the inward and ſpiritual ſupping with Chriſt, we cannot believe, nor acknowledge, that ye <hi>Presbyterian</hi> and <hi>Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent</hi> Teachers, have any power to bleſs either the Bread, or the Cup, as Chriſt did, or to mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter, or give of his Body and Blood to any People, which true Miniſters of Chriſt have done, and do at this day, to my certain know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and joy, and to the certain knowledge and joy of many thouſands with me, and that often in the uſe of outward eating and drinking, being ſanctified and bleſſed by the Word of God and Prayer, as we have ſat down together, whether many or a few, we have truly witneſſed the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling of that ſaying, <hi>Luke</hi> 24.35. <hi>And they told what things were done in the way, and how he was known of them in breaking of Bread.</hi> And as it is, Verſe 30, 31. <hi>And it came to paſs, as he ſate at Meat with them, he took Bread, and bleſſed it, and brake, and gave to them, and their Eyes were opened,</hi>
                  <pb n="187" facs="tcp:55597:98"/>
(Note, even as <hi>Jonathan</hi>'s Eyes were opened, or lightned, when he did eat the Honey; and as <hi>Iſaac</hi> bleſſed <hi>Jacob</hi> when he did eat what he had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared of ſavoury Meat for him; and as the Angel bleſſed <hi>Abraham,</hi> when he did eat of the Calf, and the Cakes that were ſet before him; and as <hi>Melchizedeck</hi> bleſſed <hi>Abraham,</hi> when he brought him Bread and Wine; and divers other the like examples) <hi>and they knew him,</hi> &amp;c. Even ſo can many ſay at this day, to God's praiſe, in the outward Eating and Drinking together, as they have ſate together, and waited in true ſilence, until God has been pleaſed to move ſome one or other of his faithful Servants and Miniſters of his Word of Life, and of his Fleſh and Blood, which is ſpiritual, to pray unto the Lord, or give Thanks, their outward eating and drinking hath been ſo bleſſed unto them, that at one and the ſame time they have eat both the outward Bread with the bodily Mouth, and the inward Bread, which is ſpiritual, with the inward &amp; ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Mouth; and they have alſo drunk outwardly the outward Cup, and inwardly the inward and ſpiritual: And ſo at the ſame time, they have fed at a two-fold Table, and have been both inwardly and outwardly refreſhed, nouriſhed and ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; and this alſo oftentimes, in the uſe only of inward Prayer and Thankſgiving, as well as of both inward and outward; and yet we neither do, nor can limit the ſpiritual and inward eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Chriſt's Body, and drinking of his Blood, to any outward eating or drinking whatſoever.
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:55597:99"/>
As neither did the ancient <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> who ſaid, <hi>That all true Believers eat Chriſt's Fleſh, and drink his Blood, daily and hourly</hi>; and ſo we believe. And no doubt, Chriſt did really give his Body and Blood unto his Diſciples at that time, and it was not a bare Figure or Sign that he gave them, but in the uſe of the Bread and Wine, he gave them at the ſame time, an inward enjoyment of him. And all this we own, and are very glad of ſuch occaſions, when we have them, to ſit to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and eat and drink both outwardly and inwardly, enjoying a two-fold Table and Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per at one time, and finding the Lord himſelf ſpiritually preſent, and bleſſing both unto us, and enabling us to receive both his Spiritual and Temporal Bleſſings, with <hi>Prayer</hi> and <hi>Thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving:</hi> And ſuch breaking of Bread we own, from Houſe to Houſe, even outwardly as well as inwardly, with ſingleneſs and gladneſs of Heart, as the <hi>Primitive Chriſtians</hi> did of Old, ſometimes in a leſſer Number, and ſometimes in a greater: For at that Supper above mentioned, <hi>Luke</hi> 24.30. there were only preſent theſe two Diſciples, beſides Chriſt himſelf; ſo that it is not the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, whether greater or ſmall, that is eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial. And alſo we do believe, and ſay, that it is our Duty, not only in theſe more ſolemn Eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and Drinkings, to remember the Lord's death, and what he hath done, and ſuffered for us, when we thus eat &amp; drink together, perhaps many belonging to divers Families, but alſo in all our other Eatings and Drinkings, and at all other
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:55597:99"/>
times, as it doth pleaſe the Lord to enable us; and every true <hi>Chriſtian</hi> hath the Lord's Death, Reſurrection, and his great Love, and what he hath done and ſuffered for us, printed as in Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital Letters, upon his very Heart and Soul, and writ as a living Epiſtle, with the Spirit of the living God, upon fleſhly Tables; and that this ought to be done, not only to his more abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant inward and ſpiritual coming unto us, but to be perpetuated, and continued by all true <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> to the end of the World, and the laſt coming of Chriſt. And now tell me, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we are behind you? or wherein we fall ſhort of you? or what excellency, worth, or value hath your Supper above, and beyond ours? But on the contrary, hath not ours the advantage every way? Seeing we have more frequently, both the outward and inward eating and drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing together, than ye have the outward; and alas, the many lean and dead Souls among you, void of inward and ſpiritual diſcerning, taſte or ſavour, too manifeſtly demonſtrate, ye are ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally ſtrangers to the Supper of the Lord. And we alſo acknowledge the outward eating and drinking, is but a figure of the inward, and therefore ought not to be reſted in; but the Subſtance that is inviſible and eternal, ought to be minded, and ſought after above all. And though we are not for holding up, or preaching of Figures meerly inſtitute, for to ſignifie and repreſent a thing to come, as were theſe under the Law; yet ſuch a Figure as is natural, and
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:55597:100"/>
neceſſarily to be uſed by us all, as eating and drinking, we may not reject: For the outward eating and drinking is a natural and neceſſary Figure of the inward, even as the whole outward World is a Figure of the inward and ſpiritual, as <hi>Paul</hi> doth expreſly call it, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.31. ſee the <hi>

               </p>
               <p n="5">5. And concerning that ye call your <hi>Chriſtian-Sabbath,</hi> which ye ſay is the firſt Day of the Week; and ye do poſitively affirm in your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, <hi>That the Sabbath was changed from the laſt Day of the Week, from the Reſurrection of Chriſt, unto the firſt day of the Week, and ſo to continue unto the end of the World</hi>; ſee Confeſſ. cap. 21. ſect. 7. But ye bring no ſober proof for any ſuch change, and the Scriptures ye cite ſay no ſuch thing, as <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.2, 3. <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.10. <hi>Exod.</hi> 20.8, 10. <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.17. That place in <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.2, 3. ſaith nothing of the <hi>firſt Day,</hi> but of the <hi>ſeventh Day</hi>: And what that <hi>ſeventh Day</hi> is, ye cannot demonſtrate. And as to the next Scripture, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.10. where <hi>John</hi> ſaith, <hi>He was in the Spirit on the Lord's Day.</hi> Although it is more than ye can prove from Scripture, that the <hi>firſt Day</hi> of the Week is that <hi>Lord's Day</hi>; yet taking it for granted, it doth not therefore follow that it was appointed to be the <hi>Chriſtian Sabbath</hi>: But it might be ſo call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, becauſe Chriſt roſe upon that day, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured that day ſolemnly, not only with his ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing upon it, but appearing at ſundry times on that day to his Diſciples, betwixt his Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection and Aſcenſion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And that the <hi>Chriſtians</hi>
                  <pb n="191" facs="tcp:55597:100"/>
did uſually and more ſolemnly meet on that day for publick and religious Worſhip, in honour of our Saviour, than on other days, we readily grant; and ſo alſo do we, according to the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of the ancient <hi>Chriſtians.</hi> And all true <hi>Chriſtians</hi> ſhould employ more of their time in religious Works and Services, both in private and in publick, than the <hi>Jews</hi> did, and ought not to fall ſhort of them, but exceed them. And that beſide other times ſet apart for the worſhip of God, both in publick and in private, it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable in <hi>Chriſtians</hi> to ſet apart the firſt day of the Week from common and ordinary labour, not only for an eaſe to their Servants and Cattel, but alſo that they may with the more freedom, and cheerful readineſs attend upon the Lord, and his Service, without all incumbrance. For experience doth prove it, that even bodily Reſt from toyl and labour, doth contribute to the eaſe of the Mind, and is a help, being duly uſed, to disburthen it from divers weights. For if the Body be over-charged with labour, it is a hurt and clog unto the Mind in divers reſpects? But all this doth not prove, that the firſt day of the Week was appointed for a Sabbath, and put in the room of the ſeventh day of the Week, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned to the <hi>Jews,</hi> and People of <hi>Iſrael</hi>; for that outward Sabbath that was enjoyned unto them, was a Sign and Figure, as all other out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Sabbaths which they had, were, as of Weeks, Months, Years, as well as of Days. And when the pure Goſpel and Chriſtian Diſpenſation did
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:55597:101"/>
take place, all theſe figurative and ſhadowy Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths were changed to the Subſtance, and that Subſtance or Body is Chriſt, according to <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 2.17. But to ſay, the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Sabbath is chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into the firſt day of the Week, is to put the firſt day of the Week in the room of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, which is a great diſhonour unto him; for he is the End and Perfection of the Law, and of all the ſhadowy and figurative Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances thereof: And as the outward Temple that the <hi>Jews</hi> had, is not to be changed into another outward Temple, but Chriſt is the true Temple of the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> wherein they meet, ſo he is their Sabbath, and not any outward day. Next, as to <hi>Exod.</hi> 20.8, 10. it ſaith nothing of the firſt day of the Week, nor of one day of ſeven: All this is but Man's invention. But it mentioneth the ſeventh day, wherein the Lord reſted from all his Works, and that Reſt ſignifieth the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection or finiſhing of them; although as it is ſaid, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. the Works were finiſhed from the Foundation of the World; and therefore that ſeventh day doth ſignifie Chriſt Jeſus, the firſt and the laſt, who is the alone true Reſt and Sabbath of all the Faithful, as he invited, ſaying, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.28. <hi>Come unto me all ye that labour, and are heavy laden, and I will give you Reſt.</hi> And con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this ſpiritual and divine Sabbath, or Sabbatiſm, it is ſaid in <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.9, 10. <hi>There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there doth remain a Reſt unto the People of God: for he that is entred into his Rest, he alſo hath ceaſed from his own Works, as God did from his; let us
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:55597:101"/>
labour therefore to enter into that Reſt,</hi> &amp;c. And Verſe 3. <hi>We which have believed, do enter into Reſt.</hi> By all which it doth plainly appear, that the New-Teſtament underſtandeth the <hi>Christian Sabbath,</hi> not of any outward Day, but of Chriſt, which the outward Sabbaths of the <hi>Jews</hi> did by way of Allegory ſignifie and hold forth. And laſtly, as to <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.17. where Chriſt ſaith, <hi>he came not to destroy the Law, but to fulfil it</hi>; It is not to be underſtood that he came to keep up, and perpetuate the Types and Figures of the Law, but to put an end to them, and in the room and place thereof to fulfil all the Righteouſneſs, Equity and Juſtice, that they did ſignifie or hold forth, which is as the Kernal: Otherwiſe ye might argue, as much for upholding the outward Circumciſion, as the outward Sabbath; and that outward Sabbath was not the firſt day, but the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth day. And whereas ſome plead, that the 4th Commandment is altogether Moral, as well as the other nine that were given forth immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by the Mouth of the Lord unto the People, and writ by his Finger on the Tables of Stone; and therefore is perpetual, and never to be abroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. If all this be granted, it doth not prove that the firſt day of the Week is there command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as theſe called <hi>Presbyterians</hi> and <hi>Independents</hi> would have it. Nor can they who plead for the keeping of the ſeventh day of the Week for the Sabbath, prove that the ſaid fourth Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment did enjoyn to the <hi>Jews</hi> the keeping of any outward or natural ſeventh day of the Week;
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:55597:102"/>
for their keeping the outward ſeventh day of the Week was enjoyned to them among the other Ceremonial Laws and Precepts, as is clear from <hi>Exod.</hi> 16.23. and Chap. 31.13, 14. where it is called a <hi>Sign,</hi> to wit, of that ſpiritual, moral and perpetual Sabbath. And therefore if it be granted, that the fourth Commandment is alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether moral and perpetual, it doth not follow that the ſeventh day therein mentioned, is any outward day, or that it enjoyneth any outward day (for it can all be ſpiritually underſtood very well) as the tenth Commandment, <hi>Thou ſhalt not covet,</hi> doth not enjoyn any outward thing, but reacheth to the Heart, and inward part, only, and is altogether Spiritual. And as the laſt Commandment of the ſecond Table is alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether ſpiritual, ſo why may it not be ſaid that the laſt Commandment of the firſt Table is alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether ſpiritual? And even the myſtick Writers among the <hi>Jews</hi> do acknowledge, that not only the ſeventh day mentioned in the fourth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, but all the ſix days ſignifie ſpiritual Days and Myſteries, as well as the ſeventh; of which I ſhall not particularly enlarge at preſent.</p>

Repent, Repent for your great Sins, and Tranſgreſſions of all ſorts, that ye have committed againſt the Lord, and againſt his holy and divine Light and Gift in all your Hearts, and eſpecially Repent of your great <hi>Hypocriſie,</hi> all Teachers and People of <hi>Boston,</hi> and <hi>New-England</hi> every where, who call your ſelves <hi>Christians,</hi> and have a Name to live, but are dead, who draw near unto God with your Mouths, and honour him with your Lips, but
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:55597:103"/>
have removed your Hearts far away from him, and who have the Name of Chriſt oft in your Mouths, and think to cover you with his impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Righteouſneſs, while ye are ignorant of his Life, and holy Power &amp; Spirit, and divine Nature in your Hearts, and while ye are daily crucifying the Lord of Glory afreſh, and putting him to open ſhame, and treading under Foot the Blood of the Covenant, as the holy Scripture declareth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning ſome that profeſſed Chriſt Jeſus in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Ages. And this is the ſtate of many of you, yea, of the generality of you, both Teachers and People of <hi>Boſton,</hi> and <hi>New-England,</hi> of all ſorts, a few Names excepted, whom the Lord doth honour, and they ſhall walk with him in White, although ye have ſought to diſhonour them. And this I have ſeen from the Lord in that pure Light of his that maketh all things manifeſt, and before which all things are naked and bare, which Light ye generally deſpiſe, and reject, and blaſpheme, calling it, <hi>A meer na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Light, and inſufficient to lead unto God</hi>; and the Children of it ye have hated, reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and mocked with cruel Mockings, whereby ye have ſufficiently declared your ſelves to be born after the Fleſh, and not after the Spirit. Oh ye <hi>Blaſphemers</hi> againſt God, and his Temple (which is his Light) and them that dwell there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in! Repent, repent of your Blaſphemies, and hard Speeches, and hard Thoughts againſt Gods inward appearance, by his <hi>holy Word, Light</hi> and <hi>Spirit</hi> in all your Hearts: And Repent of all
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:55597:103"/>
your <hi>Pride, Vanity, Folly, Excess</hi> in <hi>Meats, Drinks,</hi> and <hi>Apparel,</hi> who though ye profeſs your ſelves to be more pure, and more purely reformed, than other Churches, ſo called, yet in the ſight of God ye are nothing better, but many of you worſe; and the Sin of <hi>Sodom</hi>; which was <hi>Pride,</hi> and <hi>Excess,</hi> and <hi>fulness of Bread,</hi> is the Sin of many of you, eſpecially of the richer ſort. Oh, unthankful Nation! Do ye thus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quite the Lord, who are <hi>Jeſurun</hi> like, that ſince ye waxed fat, have kicked againſt the Lord, and are gone from that Tenderneſs, Sobriety, and Simplicity that was among you, and your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſometime ago: Oh! how quickly have ye degenerated, and departed from the Lord, of whom ye have made, and ſtill are making a great Profeſſion! The anger of the Lord is ready to break out againſt you yet more than formerly, unleſs ye Repent: And though his Hand hath been manifeſtly ſtretched out againſt you, in manifeſt Judgments, and eſpecially in <hi>Blaſtings</hi> and <hi>unfruitful Seaſons,</hi> and other Judgments, and Plagues, and Strokes upon you, yet ye have not ſeen nor regarded it, many of you, yea, moſt of you; but ye are like unto them, concerning whom the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> teſtified, ſaying, <hi>Lord, when thy Hand is lifted up, they will not ſee; but they ſhall ſee, and be aſhamed for their Envy at the People.</hi> And this is the Word of the Lord unto you, all Teachers, and People of all ſorts, of <hi>Boston</hi> and <hi>New-England,</hi> all ſuch of you who are Unbelievers, and have not Faith in the Light
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:55597:104"/>
of God and Chriſt within you, but place all your Confidence, Faith and Reliance upon the <hi>imputed Righteouſness</hi> of Chriſt without you, and what he did, and ſuffered for you unto Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, while in the mean time ye know not Chriſt within you, and ſo are in the ſtate of Reproba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or rejection, as ſuch; and while ye there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main, oppoſing Chriſt without, to Chriſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, profeſſing to own him without, but denying him within, and the Revelation of him within in mens Hearts, and crucifying him by your daily great Sins and Iniquities of all ſorts. But is Chriſt divided? Or can any have a right and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere Faith in Chriſt, as he came and ſuffered Death in the Fleſh, and roſe again and aſcended into Glory, unleſs they believe in him, and own and witneſs him revealed in them, their <hi>King, Priest</hi> and <hi>Prophet, Lord, Judge,</hi> and <hi>Lawgiver,</hi> their <hi>Head</hi> and <hi>Foundation</hi> laid in them, <hi>Christ in them the hope of Glory</hi>? And all who ſincerely own him within them, have the benefit and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of his <hi>Death,</hi> and <hi>Sufferings,</hi> and <hi>Righteouſness,</hi> that he accompliſhed without them, when he came in the Fleſh, and none others; and this is unto you all the Word of the Lord, whether ye will hear, or forbear. And oh! Repent, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent of all your <hi>Self-Righteouſness,</hi> and <hi>Self-willings,</hi> and <hi>Self-runnings</hi> and <hi>actings</hi> of all ſorts, in that ye call your <hi>Duties</hi> and <hi>Performances,</hi> wherein ye are daily exerciſing your ſelves, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Lord's holy Spirit, and Power, and Life inwardly revealed, to which ye are Strangers,
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:55597:104"/>
and many of you wilfully ignorant, hating and refuſing to be informed or inſtructed, even many or moſt of you. And all ye who have made light of the cruel Sufferings of the Lord's Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, called in deriſion <hi>Quakers,</hi> and ſome of whom have been put to Death at <hi>Boston,</hi> by a moſt unrighteous and inhuman Law, wherein they who either made or executed the ſame, have ſhewed themſelves more inhuman,<note rend="inter">Read and well conſider <hi>Ezekiel</hi> 9.3.4. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.2.</note> cruel and barbarous than many, or moſt of all ſorts of mankind. Oh! mourn be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord for this great Sin, and for ſhedding the Blood of the Innoccent, wherewith your Land is ſtill defiled, and the Iniquity of it is not yet done away, nor ſhall, nor indeed can, but by deep Repentance, Mourning and Contrition of Soul, and Godly Sorrow, and unfeigned Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and turning unto the Lord; and let it not be an excuſe unto you, that many of you were not the actors in that great Sin, but ye have not mourned for it before the Lord, many, yea, moſt of you, and therefore it lieth upon you: and this is the Word of the Lord unto you.</p>

            <p>I being well aſſured, both by the Spirit of God in my Heart, and the Teſtimony of the holy Scriptures, that the Doctrin ye preach to the People is falſe, and pernicious to the Souls of People in many things, do earneſtly deſire and entreat you, and every one of you, the Preachers in the Town of <hi>Boston,</hi> to give me a fair and publick hearing, or meeting with you, either in one of your publick Meeting-Houſes, or in any other convenient place, where all who are deſirous to come may have liberty, and let the time be as ſoon as may, as either to day in the Afternoon, or to morrow in the Fore-noon, but rather than fail, if ye will give me any aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance to have a meeting with you, I will attend your leaſure for two or three days to come, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding once this day you ſend me your poſitive anſwer; and if ye give me a meeting with you, I profer in true love and good-will, by the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine aſſiſtance, to ſhew and inform you, that ye teach and preach unto the People, many falſe and unſound Principles (contrary to the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin of Chriſt, ſufficiently declared in the holy Scriptures) your Doctrin being according to
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:55597:105"/>
the <hi>Catechiſm</hi> and <hi>Confeſſion of Faith</hi> of the Church of <hi>Boſton</hi> and <hi>New-England,</hi> which I have dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently examined, and find it to be the ſame, with that publiſhed by the aſſembly of <hi>Presbyterians</hi> and <hi>Independents</hi> at <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> in Old <hi>England,</hi> about forty Years ago, excepting ſome few ſmall things, wherein ſome of you may differ in Church Government and Diſcipline, and if ye cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive my Information, I profer to debate theſe things fairly with you, which I call falſe Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin, and to vindicate our Principles, who in ſcorn are called <hi>Quakers,</hi> whom ye have falſly charged, for which ſome of our worthy Friends have ſuffered death at <hi>Boſton,</hi> and let the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures Teſtimony be the only external Rule, Teſt and Touch-ſtone of our ſaid debate. And the particular things I charge on you, as being falſe Doctrin, and contrary to the Doctrin of the holy Scripture (beſide many others that I could mention) are theſe following:</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>That God hath committed his Counſel wholly to Writing, even ſince the Apoſtles days, the former ways of God's revealing his mind to his People being ceaſed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>That God hath fore-ordained what-ever com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to pass.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>That God hath not afforded, or provided ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency of Grace and means of Salvation unto all mankind, whereby they may be ſaved.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>That there are reprobate Infants, that die in Infancy, and periſh eternally, only for</hi> Adam<hi>'s Sin imputed unto them, and derived into them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">
               <pb n="202" facs="tcp:55597:106"/>5. <hi>That the Light that is in every Man, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinceth them of their Sins, and calleth them to leave and forſake them, is only natural, and no ways ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to enable any Man to do any work acceptable unto God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. <hi>That Chriſt hath not dyed for all Men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="7">7. <hi>That Juſtification is only by Chriſt's Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſness, without us, imputed unto us, and received by Faith alone, and not by any Righteouſness of God or Chriſt infuſed into us, or wrought in us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="8">8. <hi>That beginnings of true Sanctification cannot be fallen from totally.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="9">9. <hi>That no Man in this Life, by any Grace of God given him, or to be given him, can perfectly keep the Commandments of God, but doth daily break them in Thought, Word and Deed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="10">10. <hi>That no Man ever ſince the Apoſtles days are aſſisted by any infallible Spirit, to Preach, Pray or Write; and that to ſpeak and pray by the moving of the holy Ghoſt, as the Prophets and holy Men witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of Old, is ceaſed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="11">11. <hi>That human and outward learning, without the ſaving Grace of God, and the holy Spirits inward Revelation and Inſpiration, is ſufficient to qualifie a Man to be a Preacher of the Goſpel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="12">12. <hi>That the Scriptures ought to be believed only for their own outward Evidence and Teſtimony, and not for the inward Evidence and Testimony of the holy Spirit in Mens Hearts.</hi>

            <p>I Received yours, wherein ye give no ſatisfacto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry nor reaſonable <hi>anſwer</hi> to my <hi>fair propoſal</hi>; ye call my Letter unto you, <hi>A blaſphemous &amp; heretical Paper</hi>: But wherein it doth contain either Hereſie or Blaſphemy, ye have not mentioned, far leſs demonſtrated: I pity your Ignorance, and I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive ye are in the ſame darkneſs and blindneſs of Mind that the <hi>Jews</hi> were in, who accuſed the Lord Jeſus Chriſt of Blaſphemy; and if he were now among you in the Fleſh, he would meet with the ſame entertainment from you; for the meaſure of the ſame Spirit of Truth, which is in his Servants (that dwelt in him in all fulneſs) ye blaſpheme againſt. But it is well ye have not the Magiſtrates Sword now at command, which your Brethren ſometime ago had, and made a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and miſerable uſe of it, to turn it againſt the Innocent. And now that ye have no Carnal weapons to fight with, we can find no Spiritual weapons that ye have: But by ſilly and frivolou Excuſes ye ſeek to lurk and hide in Corners, when ye are fairly, and juſtly required to appear in open Field, to defend your falſe Doctrin. To whom ſhall I liken or compare you, but to Night-birds, and Beaſts of prey, as they are deſcribed, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 104.20, 21, 22. <hi>Thou makeſt Darkness, and it is Night, wherein all the Beaſts of the Foreſt do creep forth, the young Lyons roar
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:55597:107"/>
after their Prey,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>The Sun ariſeth, they gather themſelves together, and lay them down in their Dens.</hi> For now that your Sun of Perſecution is gone down, and the Sun of Peace is ariſen, ye have no courage to appear in the open and fair Field, to defend your evil Cauſe, only in your Dens, and Houſes into which ye have crept, where the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt People called <hi>Quakers,</hi> have not occaſion to hear you; ye ſpeak Evil of things ye know not, and lie and rail againſt the Truth. And that ye (and not we the People called in ſcorn <hi>Quakers</hi>) are Blaſphemers, I have not only charged, but demonſtrated in ſundry particulars, in this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe. And yet becauſe I judge ye do ſo in igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, I believe it is pardonable, and if ye ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely Repent of it, it ſhall be forgiven you. But why are ye afraid of the Light, to appear in publick, to try your Spiritual ſtrength and wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons, when your Carnal are gone. Is not that Scripture fulfilled upon you, <hi>Job</hi> 24<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 16, 17. <hi>In the dark they dig through Houſes, which they had marked for themſelves in the day time, they know not the Light; for the Morning is to them, even as the Shadow of Death; if one know them, they are in the terrors of the ſhadow of Death.</hi> I do ſay it in uprightneſs, I writ not this, boaſtingly, or glorying in my ſtrength, as of ſelf, my alone glorying is in the Lord, and in his Truth, which is the ſtrongeſt of all, that God in his infinite Mercy hath made known unto me, and the Truth in the Mouth or Pen of the youngeſt Child, is too ſtrong for all the <hi>Goliahs</hi> among you. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member

that memorable paſſage of the Barley-Cake, that tumbled into the Hoſt of <hi>Midian,</hi> as it was repreſented to one in a Dream, which was the occaſion of <hi>Gideon</hi>'s taking courage to go out againſt the <hi>Midianites,</hi> who was proſpered with great ſucceſs, though he and his Men were but a ſmall company, <hi>Judge</hi> 7. And alſo remember, how at the ſounding of the Rams Horns, the Walls of <hi>Jericho</hi> fell down flat to the Ground. Men of an evil Conſcience are commonly afraid. Or if ye fear your People, leſt if any publick Diſpute ſhould be, they might be in danger to change their mind: Is it not the moſt effectual way to reſcue your Sheep, if they be in danger, ſuppoſe we be Wolves (as we thank God we are none) to appear openly, and in a manly way againſt us, and not to ſuffer the Wolves to hunt the Shepherds, for that were a ſtrange thing; but that if ye be Shepherds, ye hunt the Wolves and ſeek them out every way, and by all means, and be glad of every occaſion to find them? And is your Preaching to the People ſo little effectual that many Years teaching them, is not ſufficient to ſave them from the danger of two or three Hours fair debating of things? If your People were built on the Rock, ye needed not fear that they would be ſo ſoon ſhaken. In your very ſhort Letter, ye have very many idle and fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volous Suppoſitions. <hi>If this,</hi> and <hi>If that</hi>; ſo that in ſix Lines or ſeven, ye have five needleſs Suppoſitions, and labour as Men in a Sweat, or at leaſt ſeem ſo to do, to find out the deſign or
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:55597:108"/>
intention of my Writing unto you, the which is plain, without any enquiry; for I told you very plainly, the end of my writing, was to inform you, That ye preach unto the People many falſe and unſound Principles, pernicious to the Souls of People. And if ye could not receive my In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, I profered to debate theſe things fairly with you. And though I neither had, nor have the leaſt mind to Cavil, yet I moſt aſſuredly believe, that the Peace of your Churches is not the true Peace of Chriſt, but that both ye and they are ſet down in a falſe peace and reſt. And therefore he, who at the command of Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, and by the motion of his eternal Spirit, doth proclaim a holy War, and ſoundeth an alarm in your Ears, that Chriſt himſelf is come, and more abundantly coming to take away your falſe Peace, and to ſend a ſpiritual Sword and Fire unto you, is really your beſt Friend, and ſuch a Friend I am unto you, whether ye will hear or forbear. For I came not unto you in my own will, but a neceſſity from the Lord, by his living Motion in my Heart, and his living Word, that was, and is as a Sword and a Fire, did lie upon me to clear my ſelf among you. And ſeeing your Churches are no true Churches of Chriſt, as I have ſufficiently demonſtrated in this Treatiſe, their peace is no true peace, and therefore muſt and will be broken, and the ſooner it be broken, the better it will prove to many poor Souls among you, in order to their being gathered un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Lord. And whereas ye ſay in your Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:55597:109"/>
               <hi>If he would have a publick Audience, let him Print:</hi> Ye ſee how I have complyed with your Propoſal, yet not in your will, but in the will of the Lord, who hath laid it upon me, and hath aſſiſted me in this undertaking, to write this Treatiſe, and direct it more particularly unto you, and more generally to all the <hi>Preſbyterian</hi> and <hi>Independent</hi> Teachers and People, both in <hi>New-England,</hi> or elſewhere, to whoſe Hands by divine Providence it ſhall come. And I require this reaſonable demand of you, that ſeeing ye have ſaid, <hi>Let him Print,</hi> that after it is come unto you, ye would ſeriouſly read it, and if it pleaſe God by it, as an Inſtrument to convince you, through his eternal Spirit, give God the Glory, and confeſs to the Truth: But if other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, that ſtill ye think ye have Truth on your ſide, then appear in Print openly to defend your Cauſe, not with Railing and Lies, but ſolid Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, if ye can produce them. And if in ſome places I ſeem to have appeared ſharp unto you, or your Brethren, in this undertaking, I would have you to conſider, that on a due ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination, my Arguments and Reaſons are full as ſharp as my Charges or Concluſions; and ſharp Premiſſes can well allow to have ſharp Concluſions. And what Sharpneſs or Tartneſs, or ſeeming Severity I have uſed, true love and compaſſion to Souls, as well as zeal to God's Glory hath conſtrained it. Sweet Potions of Phyſick are not always the moſt ſafe. The true Prophets of God were generally led and moved
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:55597:109"/>
of God, to reprove ſharply the falſe Prophets of Old. And Chriſt, and the Apoſtles, and other true Teachers, did ſharply reprove falſe Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers in that day; and there is the ſame cauſe now, and the ſame Spirit of Truth, and true Zeal now that moveth in God's true Servants in meaſure in this day. The precious Souls of many Thouſands lie at ſtake, and therefore there ought to be plain dealing, and no daubing with untem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered Morter, or ſowing Pillows under Arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holes. I know the wrath of Man doth not work the Righteouſneſs of God, and I have la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured to keep free from that human Paſſion: and whether I have kept clear and free of it, I can, and do freely ſubmit to the Judgment of the ſpiritual Man, who hath a ſpiritual diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and is able to judge; but to the carnal Man's Judgment I have no reaſon to ſubmit. And as I freely ſubmit my Spirit to be tryed, ſo the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin to him that is able, and above all, I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to the holy Scripture, as the beſt outward Teſt and Touch-ſtone, and to the inward open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the holy Spirit, in all that are ſenſible of it, without which ye cannot but err, not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Scriptures, nor the Power of God. Ye decline my coming privately to your Houſes, ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting for your Warrant, <hi>John</hi> 2. verſe 10. but I had no ſuch deſign; however, ye miſerably miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>apply that place of Scripture, as ye are wont to do many more. For ye take it for granted, that I bring another Doctrin, than the Doctrin of Chriſt and the Apoſtles, which I altogether de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.

Secondly, what <hi>John</hi> did write, was to a private Woman, and therefore doth not qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drate to you, who reckon your ſelves publick Men, and Rulers as well as Teachers and Paſtors in the Church; and I do not find any command or practice in all the Scripture for you to decline a fair Diſpute with Men, ſuppoſe Hereticks or falſe Teachers, unleſs ye have firſt dealt with them, in order to convince them: And even ye ought not to reject an Heretick, till after the firſt and ſecond Admonition, according to Scripture, but ye never as yet gave me your firſt: And he who is an Heretick, is ſelf condemned, which I bleſs God, I am not; and ye pretend not to that ſpiritual diſcerning, whereby ye can know me to be ſuch. It is not always one, nor divers Errors or Miſtakes in Judgment, that maketh Men wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of that odious Name of <hi>Heretick.</hi> The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle <hi>John,</hi> and all the other Apoſtles had the infallible Spirit of Truth, and that gave them a diſcerning infallibly to judge both Doctrins and Spirits; but this ye neither have, nor lay claim to: And yet we find that the Apoſtles did not ſhun to diſcourſe and debate with Men of ill Principles, as occaſion and ſeaſon required. And Chriſt alſo did unweariedly reaſon with Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers of all ſorts, <hi>Jews, Phariſees, Sadducees,</hi> &amp;c. And <hi>Paul</hi> diſputed daily in the School of <hi>Cyrannus,</hi> with them that oppoſed, and with <hi>Epicureans</hi> and <hi>Libertines,</hi> and others at <hi>Athens,</hi> and went into the <hi>Jews</hi> Synagogues, and reaſoned with them; and did not excuſe themſelves with your ſilly Evaſion,
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:55597:110"/>
that theſe Men were falſe Teachers, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ought not to be diſputed with. The Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture commandeth, that in Meekneſs we ſhould inſtruct them that oppoſe themſelves, if God peradventure may give them Repentance. And though this is not the work of all private <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,</hi> who have not a publick Gift of teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and are not called to that Work, yet this is no defence unto you, who pretend to be pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Teachers. And if it be ſo, that falſe Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers are on no account to be received into Houſes, ye little conſider how this Weapon may ere long be turned againſt your ſelves: For my hope is, that in due time, many People, both in <hi>Boston</hi> and <hi>New-England,</hi> ſhall have their Eyes opened by the Spirit of the Lord, which ye blaſpheme, to ſee your ſort to be theſe falſe Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, who bring not the Doctrin of Chriſt and the Apoſtles, and the Houſes ye Preach in, not being your Houſes, but the Houſes of the People, they ſhall not any more receive you into them, and this warrantably enough, according to your own words. But ſeeing ye are ſo unwilling that any called a <hi>Quaker,</hi> ſhould come into your Houſes, why ſhould ye receive their Goods? To wit, their Kettles, Pewter, Houſhold-ſtuff, Corn and Cattel, as ſome, yea, many of your Brethren have done, and uſed them as your own, though unjuſtly taken away from the true Owners, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they would not give you Maintenance. A rare and unparalled practice, no where to be tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in all the Scripture, nay, not by falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:55597:111"/>
and Teachers, in like manner as ye have done. And when our honeſt Friends have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtulated with you, <hi>Why ye crave Wages of them, who do not hear you</hi>; ye have oft told them, <hi>The Door is open, and have invited them to come</hi>; yea, and ſome have been fined for not coming to your Houſes, ſome call Churches; but now, by your words, no <hi>Quaker</hi> (becauſe, as ye ſuppoſe, he bringeth not the true Doctrin) is to be received into your Houſes; and if this be not a contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, and a piece of Confuſion, like moſt of your work, let the impartial judge. And your citing places of Scripture ſo frequently, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the very intention and end of them, as I have ſufficiently proved in this Treatiſe, I know not to what other thing I can better compare it, than to <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Pirats at Sea, who hang out an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Flag or Colours, on purpoſe to deceive the unwary Mariners. And as I look upon you, the four Preachers at <hi>Boſton,</hi> above-named, to be more particularly concerned in this Treatiſe, ſo I do not except any others, either in <hi>New-England</hi> or any where elſe, who hold the ſame Principles with you, but I do reckon them ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged, either to confeſs to the Truth, upon real conviction; or if otherwiſe, to produce their Reaſons againſt that which we believe to be the Truth. I remain your real Well-wiſher and Friend,</p>

            <head>A brief Anſwer to ſome groſs Abuſes, Lies and Slanders, publiſhed ſome Years ago, by <hi>Increaſe Mather,</hi> late Teacher of a Church at <hi>Boſton</hi> in <hi>New-England,</hi> in his Book, called, <hi>An Eſſay</hi> for the recording of Illuſtrious Providences, &amp;c. and by <hi>Nath. Morton,</hi> in his Book, called, New-England's Memorial.</head>
            <p>THe ſaid <hi>Increaſe Mather,</hi> in the eleventh Chapter of his Book, called, <hi>An Eſſay,</hi> &amp;c. relateth a long Story of three mad <hi>Quakers,</hi> call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>Thomas Caſes</hi> Crew, one of them being a Man called <hi>Denham,</hi> and two Women, who went down to <hi>South-hold,</hi> and they met with <hi>Samuel Banks</hi> of <hi>Fairfield,</hi> the moſt blaſphemous Villain, as they call him, that ever was known in theſe parts, and ſome other Inhabitants of that Town on <hi>Long-Iſland,</hi> where they fell a Dancing and Singing after their Diabolical manner; and how at that time they proſelyted one, called <hi>Thomas Harris</hi> (belonging to <hi>Boston</hi>) to be of their way, and how after ſome ſhort time, the ſaid <hi>Harris</hi> was found dead by the Sea-ſide, with three Holes like Stabs in his Throat, and no Tongue in his Head. And two other Stories he ſubjoyneth, concerning theſe of the ſame Crew, or Company, called the <hi>Singing and Dancing
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:55597:112"/>
Quakers</hi>; the laſt hath in it a Relation, how the ſaid <hi>Jonathan Denham</hi> (alias <hi>Singleterry</hi>) and one <hi>Mary Roſſe,</hi> did many frentick and Diabolical Tricks; and among others, that he ſacrificed a Dog at <hi>Plymouth</hi>-Colony in <hi>New-England.</hi> And all theſe Stories he doth relate, on purpoſe to abuſe that honeſt and ſober People, called <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers,</hi> without making any diſtinction, nor giving the leaſt Information to the World, how that the Body of People called <hi>Quakers,</hi> do not in the leaſt own theſe ungodly and wicked People, men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned by him, called <hi>Thomas Caſes</hi> Crew, nor any others of that ſort, but have all along de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared againſt them, and ſhewed the greateſt diſlike and abhorrency of their Spirit and ways, that is poſſible, and all their mad and frentick Tricks and Freaks of Singing and Dancing, or any others of all kinds: And the People called <hi>Quakers</hi> have ſuffered more Abuſes and Inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies, by that ungodly and wicked Crew of <hi>Thomas Caſe,</hi> and others of that Spirit, than any other People in theſe Countries, whereof many ſober People that do not profeſs themſelves to be <hi>Quakers,</hi> can bear Witneſs both in <hi>Long-Iſland,</hi> and in <hi>Road-Iſland,</hi> and alſo at <hi>Newer-ſinks</hi> in <hi>Eaſt-Jerſey,</hi> how for many Years they have moleſted them, frequently at their Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and more eſpecially at our Friends general Meetings at <hi>Oyſter-Bay,</hi> and <hi>Rhoad-Iſland,</hi> and divers other places. And when the ſaid <hi>Jonathan Denham,</hi> and <hi>Mary Roſſe</hi> were whipt by the
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:55597:113"/>
order of the Magiſtrates of <hi>Plymouth,</hi> there were ſome of the honeſt People called <hi>Quakers,</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, who openly declared before the People, That the <hi>Quakers</hi> did not at all own them to be of their Society; and did declare their loathing and abhorrency of their Practices, and that they could not own them to be ſufferers for Chriſt's ſake: And though they aſſume to themſelves the Name of <hi>Quakers,</hi> and call themſelves the <hi>new Quakers,</hi> yet that will not follow, that they are of the Society of that ſober and honeſt People: For it is not the Name or Profeſſion, that is the ſign, or mark of diſtinction owned by that Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, who own none to be of their Society or Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip, unleſs they walk in the Truth, as well as profeſs it; and the Truth leads into all Sobrie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Gravity in all things, but into none of theſe mad Geſtures, and ungodly Singings and Dancings, under the pretence of Raptures of Heavenly Joy. For although we own Singing with the holy Spirit, and with underſtanding and diſcretion, and giving Thanks unto God, according to the Scriptures, and the example of the Primitive <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> yet the Singing of ſuch ungodly Perſons we never did, nor can own; and we believe that Weeping and Howling, and bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Mourning is more proper for them. And for <hi>Dancing,</hi> it was never a thing owned by that People, nor is at this day; only <hi>Thomas Caſe</hi> and his Crew lately, or of late Years, have run into that, and other mad Practices, by <hi>Satan</hi>'s Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation,
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:55597:113"/>
nor does that Crew or Company of <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Caſe,</hi> nor himſelf agree in profeſſed Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, with the People called <hi>Quakers,</hi> unleſs it be in ſome general things, common to all ſorts: For they are plain <hi>Ranters</hi> and <hi>Libertines,</hi> and upon due ſearch and examination, their chief Principle doth agree with the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> and <hi>Independent</hi> Confeſſion of Faith, rather than with the <hi>Quakers.</hi> For theſe ranting Crew of <hi>Caſe</hi>'s followers, and himſelf, do ſay, <hi>That whatever they do, they are conſtrained to do it, and cannot do otherwiſe.</hi> And is not this the ſame that your <hi>Confeſſion of Faith</hi> ſaith, <hi>That God hath fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordained infallibly, and unchangably whatever com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to paſs, without making any diſtinction?</hi> And this <hi>Increaſe Mather</hi> hath exactly followed, and imitated the practice and example of the ancient, malicious and perſecuting <hi>Heathens,</hi> who, when any unlucky thing happened to be ſaid or done, by any called <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> although they were no <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> but only aſſumed the Name on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to deceive, theſe malicious <hi>Heathens</hi> did throw it all upon the <hi>Christians,</hi> without making any diſtinction. And the like concerning theſe <hi>Ruſticks,</hi> that roſe up in War againſt their law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Princes in <hi>Germany,</hi> and the mad Crew that followed <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Leiden</hi>; The Adverſaries of Truth did impute all this as the proper effect of the Reformation. And thus alſo in Old <hi>England,</hi> the ungodly Sayings and Practices of <hi>Ranters</hi> and <hi>Libertines<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> have been odiouſly caſt upon the
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:55597:114"/>
People called <hi>Quakers</hi>; whereas it is well known that the People called <hi>Quakers,</hi> have always with great zeal, oppoſed the <hi>Ranters</hi> and <hi>Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines,</hi> both in their Principles and Practices, and have ſhewed their Zeal againſt them, both in Diſputing and Printing againſt them, more than any People have done; and have been a great occaſion and means of ſuppreſſing that evil ſpirit in them, ſo that little of it hath for many years openly appeared in Old <hi>England</hi>; and the ſame Ranting Spirit is greatly decaying of late years, in theſe <hi>American</hi> parts, and we hope ere long it ſhall be quite gone. And let the impartial judge, whether it can be any other thing but Malice, as well as Raſhneſs (as he hath ſhewed his raſhneſs and folly in ſome other paſſages of his Life, if not Malice, that hath occaſioned him for ſome time paſt to abſcond, and depart from the place, where he preached at <hi>Boston</hi>) in this <hi>Increaſe Mather,</hi> to charge the Crimes of the Guilty up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Innocent, without diſtinction, when it is notoriouſly known, both in <hi>New-England,</hi> and in all other places, where the People called <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers</hi> live, that they never did own any of theſe People, from the firſt inſtant, that they appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in any of theſe Practices. And ſeeing ye of the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> and <hi>Independent</hi> Churches of <hi>New-England,</hi> cannot but acknowledge, that too many unlucky and unchriſtian Practices have fallen out, and have been committed by your Church-Members, as <hi>Whoredom, Drunkenneſs,</hi> and
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:55597:114"/>
and the like, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Yet if when upon your firſt diſcovery of theſe things, ye have diſowned them, and ſufficiently cleared your ſelves of them, we are more Men, and more reaſonable than to charge theſe things upon you: And when <hi>Judas</hi> betrayed Chriſt his Lord and Maſter, though he was one of the twelve, and numbred among them, ſhould therefore this great Crime of <hi>Judas</hi> be caſt upon the eleven that were In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent? Or when <hi>David</hi> committed theſe two great Sins of <hi>Murder</hi> and <hi>Adultery,</hi> ſhould this be caſt upon the faithful People of God in that day, who were in Society formerly with him? Or ſhould the Crime of the inceſtuous Perſon at <hi>Corinth,</hi> becauſe of him, be caſt upon all other <hi>Chriſtians</hi>? If this be not equal, (as all ſober Men will ſay, it is not equal) it is no more equal, but abominably unjuſt, to throw the Crimes of <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Caſe,</hi> or his Crew, upon the honeſt People called <hi>Quakers,</hi> of whoſe Society and Spirit they are not. And the ſaid <hi>Increaſe Mather</hi> may with the ſame Impudence, charge all the abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Hereſies of the <hi>Manichees, Nicolaitans, Ebionites,</hi> and all others upon the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe all went under that general Name of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians</hi> in theſe days. And theſe of <hi>Caſe</hi>'s Crew, they call themſelves <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> and ſo doth <hi>Increaſe Mather,</hi> doth it therefore follow, that their Crimes on that only account ſhould be charged upon him? Let him ſee how he can anſwer to theſe things, or any of his Brethren,
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:55597:115"/>
or Kindred for him, in his abſence. It wanteth to be inſerted in his Book, that what hath befallen him of late, is a remarkable Judgment of God upon him, for his Injuſtice to the <hi>Quakers,</hi> and his unjuſt charging the Innocent with the Crimes of the Guilty. Nor is his laſt Story, concerning one <hi>Robert Churchman,</hi> living at <hi>Balſham</hi> in <hi>Cambridge</hi>-Shire in Old <hi>England,</hi> related by <hi>H. Moor,</hi> of any more weight or validity, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credit the Religion or Profeſſion of the People called <hi>Quakers,</hi> than the former. Why? the ſaid <hi>Churchman</hi> had only ſome inclination to be a <hi>Quaker,</hi> (but we do not find in all the Relation, that ever he was a profeſſed <hi>Quaker,</hi> and owned by that People) and ſome Whimſies, or Fancies did take him in the Head for ſome time, that he ſuppoſed he was inſpired with the Spirit of God, and that the Spirit of God did ſpeak in him; And at laſt, it appeared that it was not really ſo, but that the Man was under ſome miſtake, or deluſion, or ſuppoſe a real poſſeſſion of the Devil, or was mad: What can all this ſay in the leaſt, to diſcredit the <hi>Quaker</hi>'s Religion, or Principle? Have there not been mad People, and whimſical, both of the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> and <hi>Independent</hi> Churches? Yea, doth not <hi>Increaſe Mather</hi> relate how, that <hi>Ann Cole</hi> of <hi>Hartford</hi> in <hi>New England,</hi> that was eſteemed a godly and gracious Woman, and I ſuppoſe a Member of ſome <hi>Independent</hi> Church, or <hi>Presbyterian,</hi> otherwiſe it is not like he would have ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:55597:115"/>
her, that ſhe was really bodily poſſeſſed with the Devil (ſee his fifth Chapter) but this doth not infer, that either the <hi>Presbyterian,</hi> or <hi>Independent</hi> Profeſſion of <hi>Religion,</hi> by <hi>Increaſe Mather</hi> his own Judgment, is of the Devil; Yea, and ſome belonging to their Churches in <hi>New-England,</hi> have very lately been convicted of Witchcraft at <hi>Boſton.</hi> It cannot be denied, but that Madneſs, and melancholy Whimſies and Fancies, may befall ſome of all Profeſſions, call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Christians,</hi> the cauſes of which are beſt known unto the Lord. But it is altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manly, and inhuman, as well as Unchriſtian, to charge theſe things upon the whole Profeſſion. We have always aſſerted it, that it is one thing to profeſs to be led by the Spirit of God, and another thing to be really and in deed led by it. We are not ignorant how many have both ſaid and done very bad things, under a pretence of being led by the Spirit of God, and of having the Spirit to be their Rule; and yet this is no Argument againſt the leading and rule of the Spirit of God, no more than it is an Argument againſt the Scripture, that many have done bad things, and pretended they have had the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to be their Rule in what they did; as in the late Wars in Old <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> when they roſe up againſt the lawful Authority, wherein many both <hi>Presbyterians</hi> and <hi>Independents</hi> were concerned, they all did pretend they had the Scripture to be their Rule in what they did;
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:55597:116"/>
and yet ſurely, the Scripture was no Rule nor warrant unto them in theſe bad Practices. The leadings of the true Spirit of God are known, both by the firſt Motions, and alſo by the Effects and Fruits that follow after; and that is to <hi>deny all <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ngodlineſs</hi> and <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nrighteouſneſs,</hi> and <hi>to live Soberly,</hi> and <hi>Godly,</hi> and <hi>Righteouſly in this preſent World,</hi> and to follow, and be found in doing whatſoever things are <hi>true, honest, juſt, pure, vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous,</hi> and <hi>praiſe worthy,</hi> and <hi>of good Report</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong theſe who have a ſpiritual Ability to judge of things that differ, as too many have not. And we are well aſſured, that the Spirit of God ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver teacheth, nor leadeth any to think, ſay, or do what is contrary to the declared Will of God in the holy Scriptures, nor to that holy and righteous Law, that is writ by the Finger of God upon the Hearts of Men univerſally, which is the ſubſtance of the Decalogue that God writ upon the two Tables of Stone. And we readily grant, that whoever pretend to follow the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God, to be their inward Guide and Rule, ſhould be very cautious and wary, leſt the evil Spirit that doth, and can transform himſelf into many Likeneſſes, but always ſhort of the Truth; ſtep in and deceive. But there is a moſt ſafe and ſure way for every one, to be ſure, that they are not deceived, and ſhall never be, in any matter of moment, and that is for every one to be faithful unto God in theſe moral Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, or any other things which they know in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly,
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:55597:116"/>
and are generally agreed upon by all <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> to be good things, for ſuch have the Promiſe of God, that they ſhall be preſerved from being deceived. And whereas the ſaid <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe Mather</hi> hath writ ſo many remarkable Judgments of God, that have come upon noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Offenders, on purpoſe to record them in Print; and that he ſaith, Cap. 11. <hi>We may not judge of Men meerly by outward Accidents, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall them in this World,</hi> &amp;c. And ſome Lines af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, he ſaith, <hi>Nevertheless a Judgment may be ſo circumſtanced, as that the diſpleaſure of Heaven is plainly written upon it in legible Characters</hi>: And in this he ſaith true, but he ſhould have added, that ſuch Men who can read the ſame, muſt not be blind, but have the true Eye opened in them, otherwiſe they will make a wrong Conſtruction of theſe things. There wants to be inſerted, or added to his Book the many ſignal and manifeſt Judgments of God, that came upon the People of <hi>New-England</hi> in general, and upon divers particular Perſons, the main actors, for that horrible Perſecution they raiſed againſt that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt People called <hi>Quakers,</hi> and putting to death four of the Lord's Servants, for which the Name of theſe Actors and Abettors, are a ſtink over many places of the World: And of theſe Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in general, the <hi>blaſting of their Wheat</hi> gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally ever ſince they put our worthy Friends to Death at <hi>Boſton</hi>; and the <hi>Indian</hi> Wars that ſoon after followed, whereby many <hi>Engliſh</hi> were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed;
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:55597:117"/>
And after that, but of late Years, a dreadful Viſitation of the <hi>Small-Pox,</hi> called by ſome the <hi>Black Pock,</hi> that cut off very many, both at <hi>Boſton,</hi> and elſe-where, of which they were fore-warned by a Woman that came from <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>badoes,</hi> and went into ſome of their Meetings, with her Face all made black, for a Sign of what was coming upon them, ſhe being one of theſe People called <hi>Quakers,</hi> and owned by them in that very Teſtimony, which ſhe declared, ſhe was moved by the Lord to come from <hi>Barbadoes</hi> to bear among them, her Name being <hi>Margaret Brewſter</hi>; to which may be added, the taking away their Charter, and Power (which they ſo groſly abuſed, in turning the Sword againſt the Innocent) one cauſe of which was their perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting the <hi>Quakers</hi> unto Death; and the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt Judgments of God that came upon divers particular Perſons, notorious Perſecutors of that innocent People, are very obſervable, as Major <hi>Adarton,</hi> who joyned in paſſing ſentence of Death againſt ſome of theſe Servants of the Lord who ſuffered Death at <hi>Boſton,</hi> who not long after was killed with a Cow; and that <hi>Horton,</hi> Preacher at <hi>Boſton,</hi> a great Perſecutor, who dyed ſuddain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as he was walking in his Houſe after Sermon, and Captain <hi>Davenport,</hi> another great Perſecutor, who was killed with Lightning. And though the ſaid <hi>Increaſe Mather</hi> doth relate the ſuddain Deaths of both theſe men, he altogether omitteth theſe great Circumſtances, of their being great
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:55597:117"/>
Perſecutors; the which ommiſſion, whether it was wilfully in him, or not, I ſhall not deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine. But it is the more memorable, that the ſaid Major <hi>Adarton,</hi> being warned before-hand, of the Judgment of God, he made light of it, as I was informed by ſome in <hi>New-England,</hi> who had the Relation of it, from ſome that did ſo warn him, being of that perſecuted People. And alſo it is very memorable, how one of theſe perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Servants of the Lord, called <hi>Quakers,</hi> did plainly fore-tell, <hi>that the Houſe of Governor</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicot, a greater Perſecutor, <hi>ſhould be left deſolate, and become a Dunghil</hi>; as did accordingly come to paſs; and hath been obſerved by divers, to have been a real Prophecy, divine Juſtice and Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence did ſo bring it about. There are many other Inſtances and Examples might be mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſome of which I refer to <hi>George Biſhop</hi> his Book, called, <hi>New-England Judged,</hi> to be there read and conſidered. I ſhall only add one paſſage more, which I was informed of, and had it writ from ſome of the People of <hi>Barnſtable,</hi> how that from an honeſt-man, a <hi>Quaker,</hi> in the Town of <hi>Barnſtable,</hi> were taken four Cows, with ſome Calves, the <hi>Quaker's</hi> name being <hi>Ralph Jones,</hi> who is yet alive; and theſe Cattel were taken away by the Preacher of that Town, his Son-in-law, who had married his Daughter, and returned to the Prieſt as a part of his Wages. The Prieſt ſent to <hi>Ralph Jones,</hi> to tell him, <hi>He might have two of his Cows returned to him, if he would ſend for them</hi>: But
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:55597:118"/>
he never ſent, and ſo the ſaid Prieſt uſed them, and diſpoſed of them as his own, killed one of the Calfs, and ſent a part of it to his Daughter, that lay in Child-bed; ſhe no ſooner did eat a little of the Calf, but fell into a great trouble, and cryed, <hi>Return home the Man's Cows, I hear a great noiſe of them</hi>; and ſo dyed in that trouble. The Prieſt alledged the <hi>Quakers</hi> had bewitched his Daughter, although it cannot be proved, that ever they had any buſineſs with her. But to what evil Conſtruction will not Malice and Hypocriſie, and Covetouſneſs bend a thing? Some time after the ſaid Preacher killed ſome of theſe Cows, to be eat in his Houſe, ſaying, <hi>He would try if the</hi> Quakers <hi>could bewitch him</hi>; and not long after he dyed, even before the Fleſh of theſe Cows were all eat. The paſſage is ſo freſh in that Town, that it is acknowledged by divers of the Neighbours to be true: And as great havock was made upon this honeſt Man, and upon many in <hi>Sandwich,</hi> a neighbouring Town, and in many other places, ſo much more might have been expected, had not their Violence been reſtrained by the King's granting an Indulgence to all tender Conſciences.</p>
            <p>Next, as to <hi>Nath. Morton,</hi> in his Book, called <hi>New-England's Memorial,</hi> pag. 157. he chargeth the <hi>Quakers</hi> with corrupt and damnable Doctrin in the following particulars. 1. <hi>That the holy Scriptures were not for the enlightning of Man, nor a ſetled and permanent Rule of Life.</hi> The which charge is falſe; for we have granted, that the
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:55597:118"/>
Scriptures are a Rule of Life, &amp; ſo we do ſtill, &amp; the beſt outward Rule that can be found: but we ſay, they are not the only Rule, nor, being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with the inward Rule of God's holy Spirit, are they above it, but inferior and under it, and ought only to be uſed in Subordination to it. And if the Scripture were the only Rule, as our Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries ſay, then all poor <hi>Heathens</hi> ſhould have no Rule, nor Law, and conſequently no Sin, nor Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which is falſe. And we deny not, but the Scriptures are a means of our enlightning, as God the Father of Lights, is pleaſed to cauſe his Light to ſhine unto us in our Hearts, in the ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and faithful hearing, reading and meditating on the Scriptures, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but not otherwiſe, even as the Air, or Windows of a Houſe, are means of letting in the Sun's light to us; but if the Sun ſhine not, neither the Air nor Window can give us light. 2. <hi>That they denyed the Manhood of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and affirmed, that as Man he is not in Heaven.</hi> This is a notorious falſe Charge, which they can never prove: And in this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe in ſeveral places, I have given a large Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony to the Man Chriſt Jeſus in Heaven; and how he is the Object and Foundation of the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians</hi> Faith, as the <hi>Myſtery of his coming in the Fleſh, Death</hi> and <hi>Sufferings,</hi> &amp;c. is inwardly opened, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed and applyed by the holy Spirit in Men's Hearts. 3. <hi>That they deny the Reſurrection of the Dead.</hi> This is alſo a moſt falſe charge, which they can never prove: But becauſe we deny their Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:55597:119"/>
Conceptions of the Reſurrection, and hold us to Scripture-words, which is moſt ſafe, therefore they have ſo belyed us. And for the more ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of the Reader, I refer him to a little Book called, <hi>The Principles of Truth,</hi> publiſhed by ſome noted Men of the <hi>Quakers,</hi> in which Book it is expreſly affirmed, <hi>That we</hi> (to wit, the <hi>Quakers</hi>) <hi>believe, that the ſame Body which is laid down, ſhall be raiſed up at the Reſurrection of the Dead, as much as a natural Body, can be the ſame with a spiritual Body, on an earthly Body can be the ſame with a heavenly Body, according to the Scriptures Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; it is ſown natural, but raiſed ſpiritual, and the Glory of the Heavenly is one, and the Glory of the Earthly is another.</hi> And this may ſatisfie any ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber enquirer: And <hi>Paul</hi> writing concerning the Reſurrection of the Dead, ſaith, <hi>That is not firſt which is Spiritual, but that which is Natural,</hi> (or Animal) <hi>and afterwards that which is Spiritual,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.46. and verſ. 49. <hi>As we have born the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of the Earthly, we ſhall alſo bear the Image of the Hevenly: He that readeth, let him underſtand.</hi> 4. <hi>That an abſolute Perfection in Holiness, or Grace is attainable in this Life.</hi> 5. <hi>That they placed their Juſtification upon their Patience, and Sufferings for their Opinions, and on their righteous Life</hi>; both which are groſly falſe Charges, and the contrary of which I have ſhewed in this Treatiſe at length in their proper places. 6. <hi>They allowed not, nor practiſed any civil Reſpect to Magiſtrates, Parents,</hi> &amp;c. This alſo is groſly falſe, there are divers
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:55597:119"/>
other ways ſufficient whereby to ſhew both our Civil and Chriſtian Reſpect to Magiſtrates and Parents, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (without either doffing the Hat, or cringing) and that both in Words and Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures. There are only two other things which he chargeth, that we grant to be true, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny them to be either damnable, or corrupt Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin, but affirm them to be truly Chriſtian; one is, <hi>That all Men ought to attend to the Light within them, to be the Rule of their Lives and Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi> But if this be corrupt and damnable Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin, he accuſeth his own Brethren, who in their <hi>Confeſſion of Faith,</hi> ſay, <hi>That there are many Sins that Men commit againſt the Law or Light of Nature,</hi> as they call it, <hi>which are the more hainous.</hi> And ſurely that is a Light within them, and is e'en ſo far a Rule of Life, containing, as is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly acknowledged the Subſtance of the ten Commandments; ſee their anſwer to Queſt. 151. <hi>larger Catechiſm.</hi> But we do not ſay, That that general Illumination that is in all men, many of whom have not the Scriptures, is a Rule to oblige them to believe and receive theſe great Myſteries of <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> declared in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, which they who have not the Scriptures, have not revealed unto them. The other is, <hi>That we deny the uſe of Oaths</hi>: But this is no cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt, but truly Chriſtian Doctrin, which ſaith, <hi>Swear not at all,</hi> Mat. 5.34.</p>
            <p>It is a marvelous thing, that theſe Men have no other ways to oppugne the <hi>Quakers,</hi> but by
