            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>The auncient honours, fraunchises, and
<pb facs="tcp:20033:3"/>
immunities of the <hi>Muses,</hi> the adoring of learning which was of olde, causeth those teares that then brast out of their faire cesternes for exultation, now in moderne time, to haue recourse back like <hi>Iordan</hi> to drowne the swolne heart in discontent: on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly now our pennes doe shedde forth a many teares of inke, abundance of these droppes, the liuely resemblances of our sorow-duld, nay dead eyes: and this is the reason why all our pennes (I thinke) are more imploied now then wont, like silly <hi>Israelites</hi> ener ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king vp the tale of bricke: to let the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratefull world see, that as gifts are more inhaunced, so the remunerating hand is much shortned.</p>
            <p>Before the temple of <hi>Romulus</hi> there<note place="margin">Patricia. Plebeia. Plin. 15. 29.</note> were <hi>two myrtles</hi> grew, the one <hi>Senatori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,</hi> the other <hi>vulgar,</hi> for so they tearmed them: whiles the one was euer greene the other withered: there was an intercourse in their flourish and decay, two intimates of <hi>Senate</hi> and the <hi>Commonaltie,</hi> either of their languid authoritie, or of their flouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing dignitie: for when the Senate was in glory, the other was in subiection, and so the contrary. Fauour and dislike, reward, and neglect to learning and ignorance,
<pb facs="tcp:20033:4"/>
wisedome and folly, be as them two myrtles to them two states: learning must needes flourish and dispread her golden bowes whiles the blessed beames of respect and fauour doe happily reflect vpon her:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>‚ÄîImmensum gloria calcar habet:</hi> as the Poet saies fame, so fauour is a spurre: by this, learning (prizelesse in it selfe) gets it esteeme: whereas neglect of merit it dulls and rebates the quicker edge of all proceedings, and then folly (contemptible in it selfe) gets the vpperhand. Speake I all this, not as though your <hi>Honourable selfe</hi> (a knowne Patrone vnto learning) were in ecclips for deficiency that way, nor speake I this as if mine owne worthlesse action were worthie of the poize, or did basely expect reward, due to desert and not to me: but onely in their persons whose merit hath beene very much, and against them who haue very little esteemed it: for vertues and better parts most vsually like liuely sparks of Vestall fire, are rak't vp in embers of obscuritie: my speech doth ayme at some, who may, no doubt, peruse these lines with a blushing eye. What I harbour in my brest, I doe reserue to my owne vnsyllabled cogitations: and so much
<pb facs="tcp:20033:4"/>
for the respectlesse world.</p>
            <p>Now for your worthy <hi>Honour</hi> which I euer will esteeme, the dutifull affection I beare and euer will to it, hath beene a spurre to pricke me on (though free and ready of my selfe) amongst the troupe of Secretaries, to presume to offer vp this poore paper sacrifice as incense on <hi>Miner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va's</hi> shrine. My ruder hand wherein lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning is not palmestred, has onely pende what it could copie out of my cogitations, though surely first they leuild at a fairer marke, not soaring for a vulgar stoope. If I haue er'd, it is in loue and in constraint: as with a disease so with actions past: a disease at first is easily cured, but hardly seene: but in processe of time, it is easily seene, but hardly cured: so that nowe a fault can not be salued, except by the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious balme of a more gratious accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>Let this I pray your Honour, be attour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney to plead for my defect, in that I, like the <hi>Syrens,</hi> who are wont in <hi>procella can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tare, in malacia lugere,</hi> to sing in a storme, and mourne in a calme, doe likewise, being incu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>bred with other necessary occurences for my degree, tune these my vnpleasant

            <p>Concerning my subiect, it is nothing rare: for there is no soile in the whole <hi>Elysian</hi> field of diuine writ that lies fallow, vacant, and vnsowne, so toylesome euer hath beene the cunning hand of industrie in this fruitfull plot, both for <hi>Pauls</hi> plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and <hi>Apollos</hi> watering, so that I might worthely haue put my stammering pen to silence: onely it pleasing his excellent Maiestie to daigne to grace with vnex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected fauour these lines in words deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to his vnderstanding eare, I so beeing called to their divulgation, did deeme it not vnmeet among the rest happily to hold the plowe, not looking backe so much as to mine own wants: &amp; therfore haue I chosen to shrowd this abortiue issue of my braine, vnder your <hi>Honours</hi> gracious wings, my selfe beeing happily couched vnder them alreadie, hauing sweete repose vnder the shade of that <hi>vine</hi> I most did affect, and whose clustred branches I wil euer honour both with my heart, my tongue, my penne

Humbly suiting your Honour for this, to entertaine these fewer drops of du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifullnes distilled from the limbecke of an humble true heart and hand (vnanswera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble either in their portion or proportion to your worth) which I wholly dedicate as a free will offering to your Honours sacred altar, as great an offerer (in a respectfull ballance) for this my <hi>silly Lambe,</hi> as they that sacrifice their <hi>Hecatombs.</hi> Daigne at your Honours vacancie to looke on it: the glorious sunne it selfe may without impeachment to his worth, cast his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing rayes vpon the barrennest ground, as well as on the most fertile soile: so may the leaden mine partake as well the blessed hidden influence of heauenly starres, as the golden minerall without disgrace to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stellation: and it may so come to passe, your Honour may gather hunnie from this homely weede. Thus in all humility reque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting earnestly your Honours future grace and fauour, by whose gracious meanes my happier studies may be incouraged to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thyer tasks, as also my fortunes bettered: howeuer, beeing contented with the lowest ebbe, as it shall please the hand of proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to dispose of me: whose fauour ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer

               <hi>Salomon reprobatus est √† Deo,</hi> Salomon was reprobate of God, a cast-away as they interpret it. I know that some of the Fathers are diffident concerning the sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation of Salomon, and amongst them this Augustine as it seemes at a blush: yet notwithstanding they may be answered.</p>
            <p>1 First for the first: be it that he began in the spirit and ended in the flesh, yet
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:20033:14" rendition="simple:additions"/>
this is not to be ment of his final ending, he died not in his sinnes: we know the iustest man he falls 7. times a day, that is often, yet he rises againe, and after his rising he still falls, when the finger of the holy Spirit holds him not vp: and euery fall (though not finall) may be called <hi>malus exitus;</hi> an euill ending, in regard of the holy rise which is a good beginning.</p>
            <p>Or els thus he began to sway the scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of his kingdome very wisely and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligiously, yet after he reuolted from God, especially in his old age, which may be called his <hi>exitus,</hi> yet so that ere he did depart this world, ere he were gathered to his fathers, he did clense his wayes, he did repent.</p>
            <p>2 For the second, we wil answer with <hi>Bacchiarius (a Britaine, in Augustines</hi>

               </gap>, as we take it for one in the state of the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, for a cast-away, but for one reproo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of God. So <hi>Tertullian</hi> speaking of the second comming of <hi>Christ,</hi> saith, that Christ <hi>post reprobationem fuit as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptus,</hi> after his reprobation was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken vp: now what blasphemous tongue would euer say that Christ was a repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate? So Salomo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> was reprooued of God,<note place="margin">Iren. 4. hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res. 45.</note> as he was of the Scripture. <hi>Ireneus</hi> after he had recited the good gifts that God had inriched Salomon withall out of the rich exchequer of his vnspeakable bountie and mercy, about the midst of the chapter he saies, that he fell grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uously, and was tainted with the polluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of outlandish women, yet saies he, <hi>sufficienter eum increpavit scriptura, v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti dixit mihi presbyter, vt ne gloriare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur vniuersa caro in conspectu Domini.</hi> Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>ce we may gather these two things: 1. that he was reprooued of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as we spake before: 2. that the word of God so sufficiently wrought vpon his heart, that it caused him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:20033:15"/>
yet <hi>Ireneus</hi> speaks it from the rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Priest. I confesse Austen in the last place quoted out of his comment. vpon the Psal. speakes very preiudicious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of Salomon, as may be gathered out of his succeeding words, where he takes away the argument deriued from his penmanship. But if he vncharitably and sinisterly censured this holy man, it was no doubt a blemish in him: &amp; perchance rather to deterre and affright euery soule from falling so low, then peremptorily and preiudiciously to determine of his damnation: we may say as Augustine himselfe sayes in another case of Saint <hi>Cyprian,</hi> who held the <hi>Anabaptization</hi> of hereticks, so of Augustine, this was peraduenture, <hi>magis discendi modestia,</hi>

            <p>For their reason it is this. Because his soule was so deepely tainted with Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie, and loue of his concubines: and if he had repented, say they, we should haue read of his taking away the high altars before his death. But to answer. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though his soule was, <hi>dibapho peccati tincta,</hi> dyed in a crimsen dye of sinne, yet he that came with redde garments

All the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly kings, saies he, are reported in the Scripture to haue beene buried among the kings of Israel their fathers in the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of <hi>Dauid,</hi> amongst which <hi>Salomon</hi> as a godly king is said to be thus buried: but it is not read of the wicked kings, as <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roboam, Ahab,</hi> and the rest, that they were thus buried: therefore it is likely that <hi>Salomon</hi> was saued, that he did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent in the iudgement of the church: but let them that can discerne see into this reason.</p>
            <p>In briefe our plaine arguments to prooue his saluation, are these.</p>
            <p>1 <hi>First,</hi> In the 2. of Samuel, Salomon<note place="margin">2. Sam. 12. 25.</note> is caled <hi>Iedidah</hi> by Nathan the Prophet, at the command of the Lord: the word
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:20033:17" rendition="simple:additions"/>
signifieth, beloued of the Lord: and so sayes the text, because the Lord loued him: now whom the Lord loues, he loues to the ende: and therefore he was saued.</p>
            <p>2 <hi>Secondly,</hi> He was a sacred Scribe and penman of the Canonicall Scripture, inspired by the holy Ghost, as all other Prophets were; which thing besuits not any reprobate: now it is saide in S. Luke,<note place="margin">Luk. 13. 28.</note> that all the Prophets of God are, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>„Äà in non-Latin alphabet „Äâ</desc>
               </gap>, in the kingdome of God: therefore to seclude <hi>Salomon</hi> one of the Prophets from the kingdome of heauen, were to denie the Scriptures.</p>
            <p>3 <hi>Thirdly,</hi> He calls his former waies madnesse and folly, therefore it is proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,<note place="margin">Eccl. 2. 12.</note> that he seeing in the Scriptures mir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour and looking glasse, his owne blemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shes and fowle deformites, that he washt away the spots of his soule by the troubled waters of <hi>Bethesda,</hi> the teares of true repentance.</p>
            <p>4 <hi>Fourthly,</hi> He was the liueliest type of Iesus Christ the true <hi>pacificus</hi> the true Salomon, that euer was, saue <hi>Melchise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To say then that he who was thus bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried among the faithfull for a faithfull
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:20033:17"/>
man in the citie of Dauid with the kings of Israel his fathers, who was sufficiently reprooued, and so co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>sequently amended by the holy Scripture, who was the loue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly darling of God, the penman of heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>ly writ, one of the sanctified Prophets, who was so liuely a resemblance of our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Christ, who saw into his owne mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and folly, that he, he I say was dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, withstands reason, denies Scripture, and iniuries the dead in the Lord: and I verily am perswaded in my soule &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, that his portion is fallen in a faire ground, that his inheritance is in the land of the liuing. And thou O my soule inioy for euer that blessed paradise he now happily doth bathe himselfe in: &amp; giue me leaue to end this point with the Poet, Happie and thrise happie are them soules,</p>

<pb n="24" facs="tcp:20033:18" rendition="simple:additions"/>
2. let euery one vpon the bended knee of his heart humbly desire the Lord to conuert him; then being conuerted, with Salomon let him conuert his brethren. Now will I come nearer vnto this first word, <hi>Coheleth, or Preacher.</hi>
