            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Have twice Read over, with a great deal of Patience, a Paper of yours which you call an Answer to a Discourse of Mine; And, to my confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, must own, That I am not able to comprehend what part of my Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course it is you do Answer; nor in all yours, what
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:101142:2"/>
it is you mean: But in this you are even with Me; for I perceive you do as little understand any part of what I have Written, though I thought it had been in so plain a Stile, that a Child of Six Years old, might very well have done it. Yet I do not take ill from you this Art you have of misunderstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing plain things, since you have done the same in his Majesty's Promise to the Church of <hi>England.</hi> The true meaning of which, (without this misun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding Art of yours) would easily have appeared to be, That He would not suffer any body to injure the Church of <hi>England,</hi> but he did not promise, That He would have the Church of <hi>England</hi> Persecute every Body else.</p>
                  <p>Having confessed, That I cannot understand your Writing; you ought not to be offended at Me, if I cannot remember it neither. And yet there is one passage in it which I shall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver forget; because it does in a most extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary manner delight Me: It is this shrewd convincing Argument of yours, which you say, <hi>Had you been to treat with Atheists, you would have urged to them; That it is impossible, this world should be Eternal, because then it must also be Invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible.</hi> It is, I swear, a refined, quaint kind of Notion; which (to do you Justice) I do verily believe, is entirely your own: yet for all this I cannot
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:101142:2"/>
be absolutely convinced, That I am now the same <hi>George</hi> Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> which I was Forty Years ago: And to shew you I am in earnest, I do here promise you, That if you will do for me a favor less difficult, which is, To make Me the same <hi>George</hi> Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> I was but Twenty Years ago, I will (as poor a Man as I am) give you a Thousand Guinneys for your pains; and that is somewhat more, I am afraid, than you will ever get by your Writing.</p>
                  <p>You have done Me the honour to call your self my Humble Servant, and therefore in Grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, I shall offer you an Advice, which I am confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, upon second thoughts, you will not find to be altogether unreasonable: That hereafter, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you take upon you to write <hi>French,</hi> you will be pleased to learn the Language: For the Word <hi>Opinionatrê,</hi> which you are so infinitely charmed with in your Paper, has the misfortune to be no <hi>French</hi> Word: The true <hi>French</hi> Word, which I suppose you would have used, is <hi>Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atreté;</hi> and yet I protest, I do not see how (though you had Written it right) it would have much more graced your Discourse, than if it had been expressed in <hi>English.</hi> Stick therefore to your <hi>English</hi> Metaphors, at which you are admirable; and be always careful of not turning (according
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:101142:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to your own Words) <hi>The Wine of Hopes, into the Vinegar of Despair;</hi> and then you cannot fail of being sufficiently applauded by every body, as you are by your Grateful Friend,</p>
