            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </gap>e can scarce set out such Fleetes as either, how much more dangerous will their puissance bee to our po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steritie? certainly it is considerable for both of them, especially the Hollander is more likely, and hath better meanes still to advance him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self continually more and more hereafter, than he had at first to get to what he is at present: for it is not the large territories in the Low Countreyes, but their trafficke which doth enrich them, the first ground of all their strength and greatnesse; and yet their trade con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists onely in fishing on our Coast, manufactures and trafficking for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine commodities to and fro, which so much the more is by them still pursued, as they daily encrease in shipping and riches.</p>
            <p>Thus doth it too too well appeare how other States and Princes will daily grow more and more rich and powerfull, and consequently after the same rate in a short time of foure sufficient to give Chack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate unto us: The onely meanes I finde able to prevent this shame and miserie are two.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:94293:5"/>One by endeavouring what is possible that our trade may bee enlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged wherein we have advantage over all the world, as I will show hereafter, and particularly by setting our selves close to the fish im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment.</p>
            <p>The other, in procuring that other States and Princes rest contented to keep only such a number of men of warre as may not make us with just cause suspect their strength and force; neither is this course disso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to reason, or without President or present practise, for if the levy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an Armie of men by a neighbouring Prince give just jealousie, how much more may a Fleet of ships which cannot bee without men e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to make an Armie of at pleasure besides the capacity of condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing an other where they please? And even in this matter of shipping &amp; maritime forces, the States of Italie are so precise and strict, as that the Pope himselfe, Kingdomes of Naples and Sicilie, Grand Duke, State of Genua and Grand Master of Malta keepe onely so many Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies as are limited to each by generall consent amongst themselves.</p>
            <p>But in regard the Hollanders may alledge it necessary for them to have continuall Fleetes at Sea to defend themselves against the Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards, it may be as necessarie for us to importun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> the King of Spaine to make an honourable peace with them; or, if he refuse, to joyne with the Hollanders and share with them in the bootie, for if we sit still, and they goe on conquering as is like enough, the more they get, the lesse able (if they please) shall we be to keep our selves from being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer'd too at last, and living at others mercie, would at best bee but dishonourable, when if wee fare well, wee must conne them thanks and not our selves: Let us not then runne a farther hazard subjecting our selves to remaine betrai'd in the end by our owne flatterie: did wee but consider the ods wee had of other States in Sea-forces but halfe an age agoe; and now reflect upon the great Fleetes they make both in the Ocean and Mediterranean Sea, we may finde their power such at Present, as may render them justly to bee suspected of us here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, and unlesse wee show our selves sole Soveraigne of the Sea, and with our Trident Scepter give lawes (whilst we may) to all Nations there, wee must receive them from others, when wee cannot helpe it: Forraine Nations teach us the truth hereof alreadie by fishing in our Seas whether wee will or no, and the French in disturbing our trade the last yeare in the Mediterranean Sea, and enacting lawes prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall both to it and our Navigation, which of themselves are able to beat us out of trade in time, and so much more, when Christendome shal be at peace, by which means the trade of Spaine will be free for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Nations which at present as it were we Monopolize to our selves,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:94293:5"/>
and our Cloth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ers and other Manufactors in swarmes flocking over into Holland to enjoy their liberties, (which God knowes how justly) but whether it bee true and due libertie, or only so suggested, it is equally dammageable to this State, since it causes their depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and the ill consequences ensuing thereupon; it concernes us therfore (and that suddenly) to prevent others by good usage, get those backe againe that are gone, or hinder the progresse of their art and manufacture, which else both may, and justly too, bee counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined.</p>
            <p>And whereas it may bee inferred by what I said before, that the enlarging of our trade would keep us still predominant over all other States and Princes, I will set downe some few indigested Notions to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the producing and continuing a flourishing State of commerce, which if wee doe not seriously apply our selves unto, other States will questionlesse bee too hard for us, and whatsoever trade they beate us out of and engrosse into their owne hands, will feede us with a bit and a blow, making us pay for it what they please, which will not only impoverish us, but ruine our Navigation, and subject us to become a prey at pleasure.</p>
            <p>Briefly then the trafficke of England may be divided into Inland, and Maritime.</p>
            <p>Inland is that which is practised from one towne or place unto an other within the Countrey, and by</p>
            <p>Maritime I meane such as is used from any part of England be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the Seas, which later is chiefely to be enlarged three manner of wayes, by Exportation, Importation, and Transportation.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. By Exportation and venting our Native Commodities, as Lead, Tin, Waxe, or such others, as have little or no workemanship, but chiefely those that require and set a worke our Manufactures, as died and dressed Cloth, Perpetuana's, Sayes, Serges, and the like.</item>
               <item>2. By importation of forraine commodities which wee any wise stand in need of, as Wines, Sugars, linnens, wrought silkes, but es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially such as imploy the poore in manufactures, as Cotton Wools, raw Silke, and all such sundry materialls as advance our Navigation, Provisions of all sorts, and Ammunition.</item>
               <item>3. By Transporting forraine commodities, either directly from one forraine Countrey to another, or bringing them first for any part of England, and afterwards carrying them out againe for such Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treyes, and at such times as occasion shall require.</item>
            </list>
            <p>In all which respects England may have advantage of all the World besides, by reason of her situation surrounded by the Sea, her Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants

            <list>
               <item>1. By granting priviledges to sundry Townes and places, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally Sea-Townes most commodiously situated for fishing Traffike and Navigation.</item>
               <item>2. By bringing interest downe to 6. <hi>per</hi> 100. at most.</item>
               <item>3. By lighting of the customes especially of goods exported.</item>
               <item>4. By cherishing and furthering our severall Plantations in Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginia, Bermudus, Saint Lawrence, Saint Christophers and elsewhere, especially perswading to inhabit and fortifie, so farre as may bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite, the Banke of New-found Land where we catch that fish.</item>
               <item>5. By using all possible meanes for prosecuting and advancing the Fishing imployment in generall.</item>
               <item>6. By setling stricter orders for overseeing and sealing cloth, and all sorts of Woollen goods.</item>
               <item>7. By encouraging new manufactures with immunities and privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges.</item>

To the first then, which is the granting priviledges to sundry Townes and places, especially Sea Townes most commodiously situa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for Fishing, trafficke and Navigation, since London is not onely populous enough, but likely still to be much more even till its owne greatnesse prove a burden to it, for wee see both house rent, provisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for victualing of all sorts, firing and other grow continually ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessive deere, the consumption whereof being so great, in so little a circuit, causes them to be fetched so farre off, as the very portage of some of them exceeds the first cost, whereas if such others as are likely still to flocke to London if not prevented, were wonne to settle themselves about Marchandizing in some other place or Port, these provisions would be neere hand to them, and consequently better cheape: Besides it is no policie for a Prince or Kingdome to have so great a multitude, or proportion of their wealth and strength in one place, how strong soever, because if pestilence come amongst them they infect one another; if dearth or scarcitie of any thing necessarie, they are apt to mutiny; if warres they may bee besieged, and then so farre from helping, as they helpe onely to sterve one another, and what is no lesse considerable, their overballancing number and riches, were it not secured by the untainted loyaltie of those Cittizens, and as well ordered by their good government (whereof wee have often seene experience) might be a temptation of ill consequence; Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to prevent this, as also not to venture all wee have, or so great a

            <p n="2">2. The second way to enlarge trade is by bringing downe inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest to 6. <hi>per</hi> 100. at least, for Interest is the rule by which wee buy, sell, and governe our selves when wee are to imploy our moneys both in building, planting, trading, &amp;c. as thus: A Marchant buying a commoditie to send abroad or bring for England, calculates what it costs, and what it is likely afterwards to sell for, &amp; finding it may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce 8. or 10 <hi>per</hi> 100. concludes this is more profitable than interest,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:94293:7"/>
and therfore resolves not to put out his money at use, but imploy it in trade, &amp; having no money of his own, is contented to borrow, because he perceives he may likely advance by this imployment to pay the use, and reserve a convenient profit for his paines, which certainly would not succeed so often if Interest ran higher, for if that bee a more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable and secure way of thriving, such as have moneys will decline trade, and put it out to use, and those that have none, either quite forbeare to borrow, or undoe themselves with interest at so high a rate: Neither can any thing materially bee objected against this bringing downe of interest, save that strangers will not send their moneys hither to be put out at so low a rate and so abridge the trade, but to this may well be answered, it were good they brought none at all, being better to have a little trade with a greater profit to bee divided amongst our selves, than a larger trade with lesse benefit on it, and that chiefely to goe to strangers.</p>
            <p>But for our owne usurers, whereas it is ordinarily alledg'd how this course would make them call in their moneys and buy lands, it is as easily answered, how all the land in England is bought already, and if any one that hath bought resolve to sell againe, surely it is not with intention to keepe the money by him in a chest without fructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying, so that let whose will buy or sell land, be the interest brought downe to what rate soever, our money'd men will not long be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And if trade bee but encouraged by giving priviledges to our decay'd fishing Townes, and practising what is proposed here follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, I suppose it may appeare there will not only bee suddenly found money enough to d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ive the present trade, but that wee are farther ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable to become the wealthiest Nation in all the World. And whereas I made transportation, which is the furnishing of other Nations with forraine commodities, the third meanes of enlarging maritime trade, unlesse we can have moneys here at interest as cheape as forraigne Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, or else advance some other way what wee pay more than they doe for use money, they will keepe us from that trade and the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of it, for if they can undersell us three or foure <hi>per</hi> 100 which is a competent gaine for a halfe yeares imployment, wee may bee sure not to thrive amongst them, but desert a project so advantagious as the Hollanders have not such another to live upon; and to conclude this point, since the lawfulnesse of putting money out at interest is so much controverted, it might be no small motive to us at least to put the use of it at a lower rate.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The third consideration was lightning of our Customes, in imposing whereof heretofore perhaps the chiefe aime and intention sometimes was to increase his Majesties revenues, but speciall care ought to be had therein by lightning our native commodities which will cause a greater exportation of them, and charging it on the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine which will hinder their importation, and yet they too sele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctively not all alike; and here it is worth remembrance that a great part of forraine commodities brought for England are taken in bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of ours, and we should not have vented ours in so great quantity without taking theirs, for wee must not expect to bring away all
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:94293:8"/>
their moneys, and our commodities not much more necessary to them than theirs to us: but Cotton woolls, Grograine yarne, Gold and Silver-thrid or Wire, raw Silke and such others which with us are imployed in sundry Fabrickes and Manufactures setting our poore people a worke should bee lightly charged, especially for such a quantity of those manufactures as are againe exported: But Sattins, Taffeties, Velvets and such others as have their full workemanship abroad should bee well charged, which hindring them to be brought in in such abundance, would imploy our owne people in making the same sorts at home, but this must bee done with caution, and by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees insensibly, least it become countermined: And though this may seeme, or doe lessen the Kings Customes for the present, it will after be recover'd againe infallibly encreasing trade, and a little Custome upon a great trade is equivalent to a great custome on a little trade, and the people employed and multiply'd to boote which are both the strength and riches of a Kingdome, and yet other meanes (if need be) may be thought upon to countervaile this lessening the Kings revenues in the interim. Provisions of victualls, especially corne, Butter, Cheese, which are the poore mans food, who hardly advances more than will cloath and feed him at ordinary rates, should be free of all such charges; Wine perhaps may deservedly pay good custome, since wee may bee without it, at least the abuse is great in so great consumption of it, and a heavie custome may hinder the importation thereof in part, but the Subject will still be the more deceived in it, unlesse it bee severely prohibited for Vintners or others to mingle and sophisticate it, or sell one sort for another, by which mea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>es notwithstanding the greater customes, they may put a lower price on it to intice their Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomers.</p>
            <p>To charge Jewells as Diamonds, Pearles, Rubies and such like su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous ornaments with great customes, would scarce hinder the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portation, for since the custome may be stollen with so much ease, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny would be tempted thereunto, desiring to advance no more than the stolne custome, and to search mens pockets and their breeches exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly (for otherwise as good no search at all) may perhaps bee thought against the liberties of this Nation, I am sure much contrary to their humour. Besides Jewells are wealth and riches in a Kingdome and consequently good credit to it, which though, if they were so much money, might be imploy'd better and improved, yet certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they are a treasure, and in case of necessity may sted a Kingdome, and will only abound after that a Kingdome aboundeth with wealth
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:94293:9"/>
and money, the superfluitie whereof is onely converted into Jewells, and such other riotous expences.</p>
            <p>And whereas sundry Statutes have formerly beene alledged for rating both native and forraigne commodities, now that wee are in time of Parliament which hath power to make new or repeale the old, mee thinks we need not so much oblige our selves to what passed here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore in this behalfe, as to examine whether there bee the same rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son for rating this or that commoditie, and encrease or pull down: the customes accordingly: wherein two things may well bee aymed at; first the raising a revenue to the King, and secondly to produce a flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing state of traffike to the Kingdome, and as the former must not bee forgot, so may the latter bee found of such necessitie as that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it both King and Kingdome ere long will come far short of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues and abundance which hitherto they enjoyed; wherefore our dri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>t must primarily be to enlarge trade.</p>
            <p>Since then two Nations carrying cloth or any other wares unto a market, the best cheape will out of doubt sell soonest and thereby eate the other out of trade; and in regard a necessitie lyes upon us to finde out vent and issue for our severall manufactures and commodities whereby the poore people may continually be kept a worke, if this be not to be compassed by selling cheaper than hitherto we have done, &amp; that Marchants cannot possibly sell cheaper unlesse they be eased in the customes, certainely there may arise not onely a conveniencie, but a peremptorie necessitie that it bee so for preventing greater mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe.</p>
            <p>Wherefore when setling the booke of rates be seriously considered of and weighed, it may in all likelihood appeare that some native commodities and manufactures will justly require the freedome of all customes and such like charges, and others especially forraigne for as good reason to be charged double, whereof if one ballance the other, the revenue will bee the same as formerly, besides the encrease in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall which will undoubtedly attend a well ordered State and Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of trade; but if by this meanes the wonted revenue should for the present be impayred, that may be raised by multiplicitie of other, meanes, each wherof would be lesse burthensome or dammageable to the Body Politike, than any course how plausible soever, which proves an obstacle to trades enlargement: wherefore I must crave leave to presse this farther, and say I suppose there will be found up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on due enquirie, necessitie of freeing broad cloath and some other Woollen manufactures from all or the greatest part of customes unlesse
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:94293:9"/>
wee can keepe other Nations from making the same sorts, or be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented the vent of ours should continually decrease, untill we be quite beaten out of it by forraigne Nations, who could not thrive so well therein, unlesse they had been able to undersell us, I wish therefore it may be throughly thought on and in due time prevented.</p>
            <p>Yet for the decay of our Woollen Staple in some Countreyes wee cannot remedie it by withdrawing our customes and other charges, unlesse we prevaile with those states that they not only not impose new duties, but pull off such as are of latter times imposed contrarie to our ancient priviledges in their jurisdiction, and the Royall trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and capitulations on Our States behalfe with Theirs respective<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, wherein if I should particularize, it would appeare very notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous how in some Countreyes our cloath and other commodities have exceedingly beene burthened, purposely to keepe us from bringing them thither, and encreasing the manufacture thereof amongst them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, which succeedes so well with them, as if wee bee but a little longer contented with it, for what concernes redresse, we may for ever after hold our peace.</p>
            <p>Yet if such advantages may be layde holde of betweene States and Princes in amitie and alliance, and wee as ready to practise them as they, perhaps others might be glad to beginne a <hi>Palinodia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Would the Hollanders take it kindly that wee forbid them fishing on our Coast and drying their netts on our shoare? would those of Brabant, Flanders, &amp;c. to whom reciprocall trade and intercourse is of greater consequence like well it were withdrawne? can France drinke all the wine she makes, or heare willingly a bill of banishment against her babies and such like toyes for exporting no little summes of golde and silver yearely? If wee prohibite the importation of Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance but a yeare onely which costs us 70 m. pounds Starling ready money, would not the State of Venice see wee can better live without them, that their subjects of Zante and Zafalonia without bread, or eate currance in lieu of bread? and yet, poore people! they have no other shift; surely then if wee knew our own strength, they might well bee induced to let us have them upon moderate conditions without multiplying the custome and other duties in such prodigious manner as now they come to exceed the very cost and principall it selfe: We have not five thousand pounds worth of trade with them in a yeare besides these currance so dammageable to our selves, and for our friendship, however they regard it, it is of good consequence to them<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> in that the greatest part of their woolls from Spaine, and the rest from

Constantinople is most commonly brought in English shipping, which if they come short of, our own cloth may find so much more vent in Barbarie and Turkie; I purposely forbeare to enter upon o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, these few will evidently demonstrate our abilities to play with other Nations at their owne weapons, if wee bee provoked there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to.</p>
            <p>But some commodities there are which should not be reported nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with, nor without Customes saving upon mature deliberation, as Ammunition of all sorts, Timber, cordage, Pitch, and all other materialls of shipping and Navigation, which may in time offend our selves; yet when wee have advance, and it is probable our Neighbours, (nay very enemies) will have them from other parts, then had wee best serve them, and get the benefit thereof, whereas otherwise they will through necessity seeke out and bee able to provide themselves elsewhere, wee loosing what wee might securely have advanced, and perhaps be farther prejudiced in the consequences thereof: As in the transportation of Iron Ordnance whereof wee might have furnished all the world, but holding them at so high a rate taught the Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans, Danes, and Swedes, to finde meanes and make them better cheape at home to this Kingdomes dammage above 20 m. l' <hi>per annum</hi> besides the imployment of so many people. And certainly there are Offices which in Christianity wee owe to our very enemies, much more our Christian neighbours, and Protestants most of all (which makes mee wish even with zeale and servencie the Hollanders procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings and carriage towards us were such as might not make them jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous of us in this or any other respect) the omission whereof in us God Almighty knowes how to punish even with <hi>Lex talionis</hi> if hee please; yet I thinke we are not the only sinners in this kinde conceaving that Nation uses their utmost art against us and all the world besides in this respect, the French having likewise of late yeares much encroach'd herein: And it is remarkeable how our Tin not long since being rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed from Duckets 16. to Duckets 26. in Legorne, and other forraine parts proportionably, a mine of Tin is lately found in Barbarie from whence quantity being brought for Italy hath pull'd the price of ours back-againe to about Duckets 16. as it was heretofore, and may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps finde the way to France, Turkie, and other Countreyes too, hereafter.</p>
            <p>And in furnishing our enemies with provisions and ammunition defensive or offensive me thinks there is a policie not a little conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, in that they being fitted from time to time by us at a mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:94293:10"/>
price makes them live securely and seeke no farther, expecting to have it brought unto them according to their custome, in which case if for our advantage at any time wee have just cause to denie it them, it is very likely we may supprize them on a sudden before others not being used thereto can bring it them<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> or they perhaps bee able to provide themselves elsewhere.</p>
            <p n="4">4 The fourth meanes is by increasing and improving our new Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations in the Westerne Ilands and encouraging to others; this is a matter of exceeding great moment enlarging both our Dominions and our Traffike; if people of good report and ranke could be prevai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led upon by immunities and priviledges to bee the first Inhabitants in any new discoverie, certainly the businesse through their orderly and good government might succeede more prosperously, but for want of such it were farre better there were power and authority given to take up all beggars both men and women throughout these King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes and send them for some of the new Plantations, all delinquents for matters which deserve not hanging, might bee served so too with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out sparing one of them, and all such persons in the meane time bee kept in houses for the same purpose, and forced to worke or starve, untill the time of the yeare and ships were ready to carry them away; and as these might likely doe better there, betaking themselves to get a living, so should wee not onely free the streetes and countrey of such rascals and vagrant people that swarme up and downe at present; but prevent many others, some, whereof are successively borne and bred so, the rest brought to the same begging lasie life by their ill ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, and a great summe of money saved, which uses yearely to bee given to such vagabonds to no purpose but to make them worse through the encouragement they have to continue so by our misled charity and daily almes.</p>

meanes of our future commerce and propriety: for however of late ages, and even at present, we are of considerable strength and credit to all the world for cloathing so many of them with our Wollen com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities, yet if we consider seriously thereof, and see wee cannot at present vent in Germanie and the Low Countreyes, one third part of what wee used in former times, being beaten out of it by their sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty and industrie in making the same themselves, wee may perhaps deservedly have cause to feare that our Woollen Staple, and Manufa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture especially, will by degrees wheele away from us in that vicissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude whereto wee finde all other sublunarie States and things obno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xious: And though as it were to recompence those losses and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage our farther endeavours, Divine Providence hath discovered us how to utter a considerable quantity of cloth (though not answerable to the decay in Germanie and the Low Countreyes) for Turkie and Muscovia, yet for the latter wee are scarce likely to enjoy it long, the Hollanders serving the same market with our owne Cloth carried thither from Hambrough upon better termes than wee can, which might perhaps be prevented by putting a greater charge and custome on such sorts of Cloth sent for those parts, which are not spent there, but carried for Muscovia or Barbarie, were it not that hereafter they will likely be able to make the Cloth themselves, and so debarre us totally; But for Turkie, whereas some few latter yeares wee have sent above 20 m. Clothes died and dressed, it is certaine we cannot continue the trade in the future with any profit for above halfe that quantity, especially since wee must likely forbeare those Countrey Cotton-Woolls which used to furnish us for returnes, being now served with better cheape of our owne plantation in the Westerne Ilands.</p>
            <p>But for my part, I shall not thinke our selves secure of any trade or ought wee have, which the craft or power of Neighbouring Nations shall any wayes bee able to beguile us of, and therefore most earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly doe wish, wee may, whil'st that we may, endeavour to establish our security and trade upon our owne foundation, and that must bee our fish imployment, able to beget and draw after it all trade besides, being the Schoole and Nurserie of Marriners and Navigation, and briefely a Treasure more rich, and in sundry respects to be preferred before the Spaniards in the West Indies, whose store with Gods bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing will continually encrease as often as the Moone, whose influence so much predominats those Creatures, and though another King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of fish should bee discovered, such Nations as are situated neere us, will bee necessitated to feed on ours: What pittie is it then that so
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:94293:11"/>
many fishing Townes alongst our Coast should bee decay'd, nay what ignominie and bad goverment to pay and maintaine Strangers for ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of our owne fish? Certainely if ever wilfulnesse or negligence of not improving a Talent in this World bee punished hereafter, ours will bee inexcusable; My purpose is not to enlarge since others are better able, and I cannot so much as think seriously thereof without a profound disturbance and vexation to my selfe, whil'st I revolve in my mind the greatest carelesnesse that ever men committed, saving that some of our Predecessours did the like, and our successours will doe no lesse, for all that I can doe; and therefore had best desist to tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment my selfe in raysing spirits, unlesse I could againe alay them.</p>
            <p>Wherefore I will only say, if wee doe not get into our owne ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naging the greatest proportion of the fishing trade, our trafficke will not onely decline, because it cannot otherwise bee the greatest, and that (as the greater fish the lesser) hath capacity to eate out and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voure the rest, but the very sinues and strength of the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, the onely ground worke whereof is trade and commerce, will bee shaken and quite ruined in the end, at least whatsoever State else shall enjoy it, will keep us at their mercie; and therefore if wee either want moneys, men, knowledge to catch and cure the fish, or ought else to establish this only Pillar of our future wealth and safetie, let us either prevaile with other Nations by waiges and faire meanes for their assistants, or not suffer any of them to fish on our Coast, save such as will come and inhabite in our Sea-Townes with their wives and families, making themselves free Denizens and depositing such a por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of each voyages profit in a secure Banke for that purpose which shall punctually pay them and their children if neede bee the interest, and restore the Principall unto their Grand-Children, who may then bee thought quite naturalized and not likely to depart the Kingdome, or else such Boates whose men unwilling to dwell amongst us may bee permitted to fish, so they take halfe English marriners and Adventurers in the voyage of whose returne for England we are also to be secured.</p>
            <p>And since our Soveraingnty on the Seas is so evident, and the pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licie of State for our security permits us not longer to neglect it, mee thinks our neighbouring States and Princes should not interpret a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misse, if they refusing these or the like offers (without which hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter we shall not possibly be able to continue and maintaine our juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction) we doe with utmost rigour totally forbid them fishing; for even in this extremitie it will most evidently appeare unto an equall Judge, that what wee doe is only to secure our selves and Kingdomes;

            <p>And yet before I leave this point I will be bold to adde there is no course so easily to bee taken without offending of our Neighbours that will infallibly in some proportion secure us of the fishing as by exactly requiring (not by halves as hitherto) the strict keeping Lent and two fish dayes a week at least throughout all three Kingdomes, and besides increase our Cattell no little policie, especially at present to bee practised, for multiplying (Fishermen I would willingly) as the case stands, receive this pennance from Popery, and thinke to merit more of the whole state, than by all their works of supererogation.</p>

The sixt is the restoring of our Woollen Staple, and this must bee by seeking to export the greatest quantity wee can of Woollen goods dyed and dressed in their full manufacture, as also by setling such a course as the Officers who are only to seale the cloath if it hold in length, breadth, good spinning &amp;c. may not passe it over so care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesly more regarding their fees than the care belonging to their Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice.</p>
            <p>For the first, I know the enterprize was made many yeares since in seeking to send nothing but dyed and dressed Cloth into Germany and the Low-Countreyes, and how prejudiciall it proved to us in teaching them to make cloth of their owne, rather than bee so stinted by us, and since chiefely in Holland by imposing dayly new taxes and customes upon all our Cloth spent there both white and cullour'd, but if at that time in a quiet way wee had onely taken the Custome and charge off from the Cullour'd and by degrees put it upon the white still raysing it insensibly, it might in all probability have done the feate, the cheape collour'd beating the deere white Cloth quite
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:94293:13"/>
out of service, and for present wee can onely make this use of it, that unlesse wee give our Cloth both white and colour'd at cheaper rates than they make theirs of the same goodnesse, wee must looke quite to loose the trade.</p>
            <p>But for the searchers of the Cloath that it bee compleat in all the perquisites, mee thinks it might well be compassed; and it is of great consequence, for the Marchants here in England who deale for great summes and quantities cannot looke so precisely on every Cloth, examining of it end for end, and when it comes beyond sea hee that buyes it can only see the muster and the outside, receiving the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est part of it upon trust and publique faith which Marchants deale more in than for readie money, and afterwards perhaps it may bee sent hundreds of miles farther before it bee opened, or the defects knowne untill it come to bee measur'd out; Wherefore this charge and care of searching and sealing all Woollen goods may very well bee intrusted to the next towne where the cloth is made, and they imploying whome they please to receive the benefit, for their behoose, may bee obliged to utmost dammages and penalties upon every over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sight therein committed.</p>
            <p>And for Fullers-earth, Woolls or any other materialls which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce to cloathing wee must not onely forbeare to carry them our selves, but hinder others what we can from doing so.</p>

            <p>Since therefore the exportation of Cloth our most staple commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity, and importation and consumption of forraine wares must be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minished, to make good what I intended towards the enlarging our trafficke notwithstanding, the remainder of our Stocke, People, and Labours, which of late heve beene imployed in making more Cloth, and bringing in more superfluities than wee could well digest, must necessarily bee set a worke some other way, and this may not onely have effect by practising new manufactures, Fabrickes, and the fishing imployment, but also by transportation to our farre greater benefit and advantage: Now nothing can bee imagined so much to further transportation as the prosperitie of the East India trade, wherefore as it is not safe for us to part with any Countrey trade how small soever, because the wealth and welfare of this Kingdom may justly be measu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the Kingdomes traffick, so least of all may we forgoe this of the East Indies, which though at present in vents not our native commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities in such quantities as Germanie and Turkie, yet the money we save by furnishing our selves with Spices, Callicoes and other India wares at moderate rates in great abundance, and yet send larger store out againe to other Nations, and the good hopes and likelihood wee have to multiply this trade in all dimensions, may render it so consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable, as that if Marchants by their former ill successe, through the Hollanders unbrotherly proceedings, should not be found to prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute it, his Majestie and whole State have just cause to keepe it up though it were to losse at first, and if all meanes else faile, moneyes levied for maintayning it, cannot bee so grievous and prejudiciall to these Kingdomes, as the losse of it would likely bring poverty and ruine on them in the end.</p>

            <p>These Courts are setled in Italy, France, and many other Countreyes with good successe, being grounded upon reason, and practise of Marchants dispersed throughout the world, for most part, without respect to the Municipall lawes and priviledges

            <p>This Court then ought for very good reason to consist of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, in regard a Marchant of good naturall endowments bread at least a competent Grammer Scholler, having lived abroad, experienced in customes and affaires of sundry Countreyes, may questionlesse be a generally more knowing man than any other of what profession soever, and so better qualified for decyphring the intr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>But a speciall care this Court must have to dispatch each cause with all possible expedition<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> for these of all other can worst admit demurers; because either the commodities which Marchants strive about are perishable, or ships must goe on their voyages, Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners may not tarry behind and loose their service, and the very time eates out eight in the hundred from him that suffers on what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever summes in controversie; and though (as I conceive) next to unhealthines, law suites may justly bee thought the greatest misery in this world to all in generall, yet Marchants of all others are lesse able to attend them; for law suites, as the case stood, were growne as hazardous as playing at dice, and reckoning the butlers boxe too boote, the Lawyers fees and charges have much the odds, onely in this the Gamster has advantage, that though hee loose, each cast still puts him out of paine: whereas sometimes a mans suite at Law outlives himselfe, and perhaps the cause lost afterwards
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:94293:17"/>
because, he could live no longer to defend it; and yet if hee had not dyed, should never have beene ended: but my meaning is this, that whosoever goes to Law, must <hi>hoc agere</hi>; and a Merchants af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires require <hi>totum virum</hi>; now since a Merchant ought onely, and can be all but in one of these, this Court will bee the more bound in equitie and justice to free him from the other.</p>
            <p>And since this Law is so troublesome, and chargeable to all sorts of people and conditions, if in a particular office so appoynted, all judgements, morgages, contracts, and bargaines, and incumbran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces whatsoever, of Lands, Houses, Offices, &amp;c. (the just Title whereof wee cannot, by looking in his face, know to whom be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs) were necessarily to be registred, and the partie that owes them in a booke compendiously to be made Creditor and Debtor when he sells them, his title onely being to be preferred in case of controversie, who had his contract registred in this Office, and Credit in the said Book, unlesse omitted through default of the said Office, which in such case must appeare by Coppie of the Contract under-writ by this Officer, remaining with the true proprietor of those Lands, houses, &amp;c. it would certainly prevent the greatest part of Law-suits in <hi>England,</hi> since going to that office, a man in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to make a purchase, and paying a smal matter for the search, as he may see (and have Copie of it if he please) to whom the goods belong'd, were morgaged, or interiourly ingaged, and so bee sure the Title's good.</p>
            <p>The same Court of Merchants, if thought requisite, may likewise end all differences about insurance, obliging the insurer to runne all hazzard imaginable or not imaginable, or that may, and do hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to fall out of all kindes and natures, and to pay whatsoever losse that happens on goods assured in such words: for the intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the insured being to secure themselves from all casualties that possibly could happen in this world, ought therefore to have each sinister, though difficult accident interpreted in their favour: In case of losse, the Insurers should bee constrained to pay without the least abatement, and be paid the <hi>Praemium</hi> when they subscribe the policies, whereby the insured would have better opportunitie to pick and chose the rarest men to under-write his policie, and the Insurer to be freed from all losses: the newes whereof was heard before the <hi>Praemum</hi> was paid, which must appeare in writing by a particular receipt, besides that of the policie, where they say to have received it at that instant of subscribing; and sometimes cannot get it notwithstanding in many yeares after: the Insured likewise

            <p>The tenth is the erecting of a Banke or Grand Cash on such foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation and securitie, as all men may thinke their monies more sure there, than in their houses, whereby they may bee induc'd to bring them in, and receive a certaine moderate interest of about 5. <hi>per</hi> 100. or keep them there, till they shall have occasion to dispose of them, or pay them to another: and these payments, when the Bank hath once got credit, may be done by assignation, or turning them over from one man to another, without any reall assuring of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies: which besides saving trouble to tell so much money, becomes exceeding beneficiall to a Common-wealth, increasing the trade and traffick so much more as all the monies this Bank hath gained credit for doth import: as for example thus;</p>
            <p>Suppose I be cash-keeper to ten wealthy men, that amongst them al for the most part have 10000 <hi>li.</hi> stil lying dead, expecting a good opportunity and advantage to purchase Land, or otherwise: I that am Cash-keeper, knowing there can be no occasion of these ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand pounds till such a time; or if there should be sooner, know where to have as much to put i'th place of it, and withall having the owners consent, doe put these ten thousand pounds out at inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest, or imploy it in one commodity or other for my owne account and benefit, to the encrease of Trade, which is equally done as well with credit as ready money.</p>
            <p>Thus a Banke is no more than a Grand Cash-keeper of this whole Kingdome, or so many as doe bring in their monies, whereof few or none will make any scruple, when cue securitie be given, and this securitie at present perhaps will bee desired, no lesse than the High Court of Parliament; which, if they please out of their deep wisedomes to resolve upon, and the monies which shall lie idle to be made use of, for their benefit and behoofe, to take ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count thereof in their Trienniall Parliament, and dispose it to the good of the Common-wealth, with their gracious permittance, I should in all humilitie be bold to say, there never passed Act of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament so capable to advance the trade and welfare of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, with such facilitie and speed as this, as I doubt not but to make better apparent when e're I be commanded.</p>
            <p>And whereas it may be thought, that few will bring their monies
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:94293:18"/>
into this Banke, conceiving it not so safe for them to lye thu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap> depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sited in a Monarchie, as if it were a free state, especially since the monies in the Tower were so lately seized upon without regard of violating the publick faith, which in States and Princes affaires ought to be kept so much more sacred, as Princes are exalted above Subjects and termed Gods. I will crave leave to present unto their consideration the state of <hi>Tuscanie,</hi> well knowne to have continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally flourished in peace and plentie, ever since the politique and sage family of <hi>Medici</hi> had rule and government thereof, and it may justly have beene observed unto this day, that no Prince makes use of a larger prerogative, and proceeds in some cases more arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarily than these who yet end and sentence according to the Lawes in full force of equitie and justice.</p>
            <p>This Prince in what part of his state so ever hee bee, gives audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence twice a weeke to all that come, though very beggers, (O that our gracious Soveraignes more large affaires could but permit him to grant his loving and loyall Subjects the like but once a month, whereby we might not onely have beene sooner eased of many just grievances, but his Majestie perhaps both tiuer and speedier in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formd of the causes, &amp; so better enabled through his profound judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to prevent these great distractions, which have and doe still at present so much perplexe these Kingdoms) and no man delivereth a Petition, but within three dayes at farthest, shall be certaine of a reference, so that his prerogative and arbitrarie proceedingss are so farre from being injust, as they serve onely in casualties, which the Lawes have not provided for, certaine conjunctions which may not expect, or thou regard, the Ceremonial Rites, and slow or over-hasty foot-steps of a Court of Iustice (may it upon this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion be so termed without offence) and to prevent the <hi>summum jus,</hi> which even by Proverb wee have learnd to terme but <hi>Summa injuria:</hi> In this state I say, whose Prince is so absolute and Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne as none in Christendome so much (notwithstanding the Popes supremacy, which in his owne understanding is of unlimited extent) there is such course took for due administratiou of justice, distinguishing betwixt <hi>meum</hi> and <hi>tuum,</hi> and preserving each mans propriety in his goods, as not onely those Natives, but others, stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, think not their estates securer, then depositing them in the <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reutine</hi> Banke, which is by them called <hi>Monte di Pieta,</hi> where they have five <hi>per</hi> 100. interest <hi>per annum,</hi> and may receive out the principall at pleasure: In the same Banke are infinite summes left by particulars for the like interest, entail'd upon their posteritie,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:94293:19"/>
which cannot be remov'd, or al enated: And that you may ghesse how vast a Capitall this Mount or Banke consists of, it lends like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise upon Pawnes at 5 â…” <hi>per</hi> 100, and to a landed man upon securitie of such another, which is equall to a Morgage, because their Lands being registred in an office for that purpose, the true title thereof is seene in an instant, and as his Majestie here in <hi>England,</hi> so the Banke there is to bee first satisfied in case of Bankrupt, and what is thus lent, by the best infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation I could get, was thought to bee above a million sterling. Besides, there is another kind of Bank in <hi>Florence,</hi> which is called <hi>Il giro</hi>; as thus, Every three moneths the Merchants of <hi>Florence</hi> chuse one amongst themselves of best credit, who is to be (as it were) the generall Cash-keeper of all moneyes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered, or taken by exchange, for that present Faire; the manner whereof you will finde explaned at large hereafter, so that what moneyes bee delivered, or drawne by any man during this Faire, the sayd generall Cash-keeper makes him Debtour or Creditour, turning the slyd summes over from one to the other, provided hee be such a man as hath money in his Cash, and at three moneths end hee makes up his Cash, payes everie man his owne, and the Merchants choose another for the next Faire, or three moneths following.</p>
            <p>Now if the benefit and conveniencie of these Banks are thus enjoyed in <hi>Tuscany,</hi> where the Prince is so absolute; but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, his Treasurer and other Ministers so punctuall in payments and other dealings for the Princes peculiar service, as no Merchant can be more; for which cause Merchants hold it more secure, and seek rather to deale with them, than with the best meere Merchants like themselves: Why may not we, under so pious and gracious a Soveraigne, in a Kingdome founded and established upon such wholesome Lawes, expect the like good successe from a Banke in <hi>England?</hi> For being so exceedingly beneficiall both to King and Countrey, as would daily still more and more appeare, wee may easily beleeve it should bee furthered and cherished by both; the rather since it may bee setled and credited by Act of Parliament, with command that neither principall nor profit shall bee stirred or employed, save for their account, according to expresse order &amp; direction of the Trienniall Parliament, whereto onely such as over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>see and manage it, may be made accountable, if so thought fitting.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And as it may be observed amongst Merchants and prodigall Spend-thrifts, that such as are bad Pay-masters, or of little credit, can neither
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:94293:19"/>
buy, sell, or bee entrusted to such advantage as others are: So is it doubtlesse with Princes and their Ministers that are not punctuall in their dealings; for in delaying payments, the verie time unto a Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant eats out eight</hi> per centum <hi>in a yeare, besides the inconveniencies which may befall him by being disappoynted, and this verie justly too, is so fearefull unto most Merchants, that those few as are more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venturous, will not deale with such Ministers of Princes as are bad Pay-masters, but upon such odds as must needs bee an excessive dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage to the affaires of those Princes; and yet this cannot well be reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died, untill the cause be first removed; for since gaine is that which all, especeally Merchants, doe chiefly aime at, it might be justly thought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>discretion for any one in buying, selling, or any businesse of like nature, to refuse the more punctuall Pay-master, and take the lesse at the same price: and how much his Majesties affaires have suffered in this kind, such as were employed in them doe best know. But for my part, I may be bold to wish they be managed hereafter with such credit and punctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alitie, that which formerly was lost for want thereof, may be hereby re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gained: more may, though net well so publikely, be sayd on this subject, and the consequence of it, both for the private benefit and publike well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of his Majestie and Kingdomes; and part thereof will be obvious to such as have the managing of it, as will infallibly appeare when it once comes to be put in practice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The twelfth is the secure turning over bils of debt from one to another, against moneyes or wares, as thus: A Merchant sels an hundred pounds worth of silks unto a Mercer, to pay at 12 moneths, and desirous to buy an hundred pounds worth of <hi>Perpetuana</hi>'s; but having neither ready money to disburse for the present, nor credit to be trusted at time gives this Mercers bond of an hundred pounds unto whom he sold his silks, in payment of the <hi>Perpetuana's,</hi> and so is still doing something, whereas otherwise having no other estate but this hundred pounds, hee could not have traded againe, untill those twelve moneths, were expired, and the Mercer payd him his 100 pounds: but if this course be once made secure and currant, it will in the same manner as the Bank before spoken of, add lively<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood unto Trade, and encrease the stock of the Kingdome<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> for what concernes traffiquing with it, so much as these Bils turned over amount to: when a man that hath neither money, nor credit to be trusted at time, may yet follow trading with the debts that others owe him: In this case a b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>ll of debt (which likewise may be in print) must be made by every one that buyes commodities paiable to such a one, or his Assignes, or Bearer therof, &amp; so often as bils happen to be turned
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:94293:20"/>
over unto others; to prevent differences it may not bee amisse to have some notice taken of them, and registred, the parties being present before the Chancellour in the fore-mentioned Court of Merchants, paying a small consideration for the officers, making record of them in a publick Book for such purpose; and these Bills being once due, to carry present execution with them.</p>
            <p>The thirteenth, that some course be agreed upon in the nature of a Faire, or money Mart practized much in <hi>France,</hi> as that of <hi>Lions,</hi> and <hi>Placentia</hi> in <hi>Italy</hi>; by which meanes a man of credit may be furnished with what summes of money he pleases at an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant, and pay them in againe the weeke following, or when hee will; which accommodation costs such as make use of it in those parts where 'tis ordinarie somewhat more than downe-right in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest.</p>
            <p>The originall of these Faires, as also the unnaturall use of Exchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges grew thus: Divines in former times continually exclaiming a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Vsurie, which those of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church doe still to this day, voting it a mortall sinne, to take whatsoever the least benefit or encrease, by expresse agreement for the use of money, pressing it uncessantly upon the consciences of their Penitentiaries, such as having store of monies, though they found no more beneficiall, certaine, and easie way of imploying them than downe-right in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest, which they could not get absolution for from their Ghostly Fathers, were forc'd to set their heads a work, and so invented, or rather adulterated the true and most laudable use of Royall Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changes in two respects: one was, that Vsurers observing how in all Exchanges, as namely betwixt <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Venice, &amp; vice versÃ¢,</hi> he that was the deliver had most commonly the advantage, which was caused in regard, that (as in all things else so) a summe of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent money (may justly be, and) is thought something better worth than the like summe or quantity being absent, and not to be recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved till after a terme expir'd, be it more or lesse; in which inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rim the taker may make use of the said summe of money, imploying it in Merchandize or otherwise, as he please to his best advantage: whereupon the Vsurers of <hi>Venice,</hi> although they h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>d no occasion or just neede to have<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> their estates in <hi>London,</hi> on which was first grounded the truely genuine and legitimate use of money-Exchanges, to prevent the inconvenience, trouble, change, and cumbrance of transporting monies in <hi>specie</hi> from one Country to another<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> understanding of Merchants, that desired to take up monies in <hi>Venice,</hi> and pay the value of them in <hi>London,</hi> told them
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:94293:20"/>
they had occasion to deliver monies in <hi>Venice,</hi> and so agreed with them; as for example: <hi>A. B.</hi> a Vsurer delivers in <hi>Venice</hi> a Ducat to <hi>C. D.</hi> a Merchant, taking his Bill of <hi>Exchange</hi> upon <hi>E. F.</hi> to pay unto <hi>A. B.</hi> or his assignes, fifty pence a piece sterling in <hi>London,</hi> three moneths after Date. <hi>A. B.</hi> makes the same partie <hi>E. F.</hi> Assignes, to get acceptance of the Bill, and payment of the fifty pence in due time, and having received it to returne it him backe againe by Exchange to his most advantage.

            <p>The second way which the Vsurers found out, not so much to salve their tender Consciences, as to benefit themselves more by than down right Interest, was, by framing an imaginarie Exchange betweene two places, as <hi>Florens</hi> and <hi>Placentia</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> betwixt w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> there is no just cause of correspondence, Exchanging, Traffique, or sending monies from either place unto the other, and agreed amongst themselves in <hi>Florens,</hi> that whosoever (to be understood of good credit and repute) would take monies by Exchange, for <hi>Placentia</hi> might doe it in this manner: that is, whosoever will take up money from the beginning of <hi>Iune</hi> at such rates as shall be agreed on, may, but that unlesse he give order for the payment of it in the meane time in <hi>Placentia,</hi> by a correspondent of his owne, or another with this Vsurer, will helpe him to (who drawes provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of â…“ <hi>per</hi> 100. on all summes charg'd upon him, or return'd by him) it must bee recharg'd and necessarily satisfied in <hi>Florens</hi> the beginning of <hi>September</hi> following, and this is by them cald <hi>La fiera di san Gio.

So great care hereof is had in <hi>Germanie, Italie,</hi> and some other Christian Countries, nay by those Barbarous people of the great Turks Dominions, as most part of their goods are car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to and fro twentie or fortie dayes journey out right, and at present besides many others, the chiefe Trade betwixt <hi>Venice</hi> and <hi>Constantinople</hi> is drove by Land; I meane from <hi>Spalato</hi> to <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople;</hi> and many not over-fine, but bulkie goods, as <hi>Venetian</hi> Cloth, Turkie Grograines, Mohaires, Cordovans, Waxe and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers are thus conducted at easier rates. 'Tis likewise much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:94293:22"/>
to encrease of trade, to have posts setled in such other parts of <hi>England</hi> where they are wanting, and the portage of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land Letters to be lessened about one halfe: for the Inland trade being yet but young in the infancie, cannot well bee at so great a charge for Letter carrying, which in <hi>Italy, France, Germanie, Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and other Countries stands not in halfe of what wee pay: and although 'tis certaine, that Merchants and others omitting to write weekly Letters unto their correspondents, doth much pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice their businesse, and consequently the generall trade and benefit: yet I verily believe, and not altogether without experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that many a man <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And whereas before I have given my consent for all vagabonds, Beggers, and delinquents, not bad enough for hanging, to bee sent for the new Plantations, yet if that be not approved, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides that course, it may be very requisite that publike houses were built, where such as are willing to take paines, but finde no im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, may bee set a worke to beat hemp, or other toyle learn'd at first sight for a moderate hire, untill they have earn't somewhat towards imploying them in their owne callings; and the same houses to keep at work those other v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This may well seeme a secure and gainsome businesse to be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced by a particular rich man for profits sake, and like enough to prove so: but sure I am, it would bee an exceeding great reliefe to many hundred poore people about the City of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> onely, that are glad to pay, because they can hav't no cheaper above thirty <hi>per centum,</hi> nay after the rate of double the Money for a yeares interest, and leave a pawne to boot sometimes.</p>

drank, so that a weeks labour with this sawce, whet their stomacks, as they were well able to eat out what they earned afterwards in a whole week by Sunday night. A very fit salve for such a sore, for cure whereof all experiments are few enough to put in practice; yet I wish wee may begin with more mild at first, and consider what meanes, and encouraging the Husband man to be more industrious, might present themselves; for certainly hee is too dull and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse of his owne profit in particular, which is a parcell of the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall, in that it may be observed, how many of them have not so much as a fruit-tree, or pot-herb about their houses or cottages: the barrennesse of the soyle cannot excuse this totally, there being none found so cursed by nature; but if the time they beake in the Sun, and liquor themselves at Ale-house in the shade, were spent about improving it, would by degrees compell it to produce some sort of roots, herbs, and fruit, as are both profitable, pleasant, and whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some for their nourishment, far more sometimes, than solid massie food of flesh, cheese, and pudding, by reason of their practice, being where ere they come, or what ere they eat<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> to cram themselves to the throat, which since they will, is yet lesse dangerous in diet of light digestion than the other, that nothing but a whole dayes plowing or delving can put over, and cleare their braines from fumes.</p>

            <p>The seventeenth and last meanes is, that Merchants have cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine immunities from being called to inferiour offices and ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices where they live, and other priviledges of due respect and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute given them, whereby they may bee encouraged to continue, and others to betake themselves to so worthy and honourable a calling.</p>

            </p>
            <p>For since the <hi>Chaos</hi> and whole body of trade is not managed joyntly, but by the particular Merchants and members of it, one whereof sends out native Commodities, and brings his returnes home in Bullion, or by Exchange; another brings in forraine commodities, making over monies by Exchange to pay for them; and a third exports native commodities, and imports forraine too; if when there should be a ballance made hereof, and our importa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:94293:26"/>
of wares found to exceed our exportation, which in such case must needs bee paid for, one way or other, and so invite our monies over, what remedy can bee taken without disturbance of the whole trade? If flatly you prohibite the bringing in of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine goods, forraine Nations will doe the like with ours, and at last both bee reduced to receive from one another such onely as are necessarie, or most usefull: wherefore a better course to mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate this ballance, would be with dexterity to lighten or lade ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther scale in the custome and other charges, which may insensibly make one deare, and the other cheap, as is afore declared, with sundry such other meanes, all tending to enlarge traffique. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though other Princes might likewise doe the same in their domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions; yet many of them are so necessitous at present as will perhaps rather suffer some inconvenience, and runne the hazard of a greater, but absent, and fu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ure dammage, than lessen their revenues.</p>
            <p>For if the trade were ballanc'd, we are lesse able to reduce that first, and therein prevent the exportation of monies, then first by hindring monies through strictest diligence, and severe penalties, from being exported, and so in consequence secure the over-ballan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of trade; for to use this diligence rests in our selves, and being independant we may practise it without exceptions to other Nations; and if onc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>But before the exportation of monies can be prevented through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, 'tis necessarie wee know who are those that may likely trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port them, and the causes that move, and enable them so to doe.</p>
            <p>Such then as transport monies are either Merchants or Travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, and both moved thereunto, either because there is more to be gotten by transporting them in <hi>specie,</hi> than delivering by Exchange, or else because they have no experience or acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with Merchants here or abroad, or desire not to trust them, but thinke it securest to adventure their monies with their persons, which in such case they have alwayes ready about them where ere they goe; but delivering by Exchange cannot many times receive the value where they will, if they resolve to goe any other way, but where their Merchants hath credit, and promised to pay them: and these later are chiefely either such as goe away to enjoy the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie

            <p>Secondly, by sale, and proceed of goods that strangers bring in, which they doe in great quantitie, because they pay bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>d execution is carryed away, never to returne againe.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, by their infallible halfe yeares incomes, and Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newes of such vast summes of money as they keep continually at interest in <hi>London</hi>; and if you demand the <hi>summa totalis,</hi> which all these make, I can onely answer you, <hi>Pauperis est numerare pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus</hi>: but howsoever indefinite, that it is immense, will hereby appeare.</p>
            <p>Consider the great quantities of goods of all sorts wee ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port hence for forraine parts, the greatest part whereof is sold for money, and many hundred thousand pounds sterling thereof made over hither by Exchange; and yet strangers have more mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies to send out of <hi>England,</hi> than we have to bring into <hi>England,</hi> which is most evident in that the Exchange from forraine parts
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:94293:28"/>
(according to the intrinsecall value of the severall <hi>species</hi> respe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctively) to <hi>England</hi> is more advantagious, than to <hi>England</hi> from forraine parts; for even as the scarcity of any commoditie makes it to be more valued, and held at a dearer price; so there being few deliverers abroad of monies for <hi>London</hi> which are <hi>English,</hi> in respect of the Takers, which are strangers, and many Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers in <hi>London,</hi> which are strangers in comparison of the <hi>Takers</hi> which are <hi>English,</hi> the few <hi>English Deliverers</hi> abroad, and <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers</hi> at home stand upon their termes, bringing the Exchange in their favour, and this is called the <hi>Merchandizing Exchange,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause quite opposite to the nature of Exchange, which was found out to prevent carriage of monies up and downe: this invites the exportation of them in <hi>specie,</hi> and therefore a table of Rates is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded which should stint the Exchanging our severall Coyns with those of other Nations, according to the paritie and puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie both in weight and goodnesse of allay, and so settle the price of Exchanges for all Countries, which Merchants might not exceed in delivering or taking monies by Exchange.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>For answer hereto, I con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>eive it may be granted, that in delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring monies by Exchange in England for forraine parts we receive not the true value or</hi> par <hi>according to the intrinsecall goodnesse of the Coyne; but this is our advantage, and onely dammageable to stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, because they (and not</hi> English<hi>) are the Deliverers in</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land; <hi>neither will this Merchandizing Exchange likely carrie away our monies, so long as the Exchange produces as good profit, as the money it selfe, if it were transported, would yeeld in specie, which for the most part may hitherto have beene observed; but hereon, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so about the said Table of Rates, I hope it may give a little light to enlarge somewhat more, though not altogether so Metho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dically.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Granted it is then (by me at least) that our monies are underva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued by Exchange with strangers, and that though we may commonly make as much of them by Exchange, as carrying them in</hi> Specie, <hi>to spend in ordinarie payments, yet the Mint in forraine Countries may give more for them, (otherwise they are not undervalued) and this profit from the Mint may doubtlesse intice them over: but whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a Table of Rates can prevent this or no; or if it could, whether such a Table might not prove more prejudicall in another respect, will be the question.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="55" facs="tcp:94293:28"/>For though our moneyes be under-valued, it is our advantage, in regard we <hi>English</hi> doe buy our owne moneyes thus under-valued, so often as wee take moneyes by exchange in <hi>England,</hi> or deliver them by Exchange abroad, and strangers are they that sell us our owne moneys thus cheap, or under-valued, so that this is but buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and selling good cheap, whilst strangers sell good cheap, and we buy it: and this profit wee have questionlesse upon all our mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys delivered for <hi>England,</hi> out of the proceed and sale of our goods abroad. Neither is this all, for since we advance in delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring our moneyes abroad by exchange for <hi>England,</hi> we are enabled to sell our cloth and other commodities the cheaper; for if for 35 shillings Flemish delivered abroad, I can have 20 shillings sterling in <hi>England,</hi> I may sell my cloth for one eighth part lesse in Flem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish money, than if I were to give 40 shillings Flemmish to have 20 shillings sterling in <hi>England,</hi> being all one to a Merchant that sels for money, and delivers it afterwards by exchange, to sell his wares at a bad price, and have a good exchange for his moneyes, or sell his wares at a good price, and have a bad exchange for his moneyes.</p>
            <p>This stinting then, as it will bring the Exchange in favour of the English coyne, and consequently beat downe the price of what commodities Forrainers sell in <hi>England,</hi> thereby encreasing the vent of them; so will it raise the price of our commodities sold a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, and diminish their vent, which being well considered, may perhaps prove a dammage to us, at least for such a portion as is sold for money to be made over hither by exchange, for though we seem to get so much the more as we sell our commodities the dearer, yet when we remit the provenue by exchange, by re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>son of this stint, we lose by exchange a part of what we advanced on our commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; and what we lose by exchange, onely a few Merchants stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers make benefit of; and what wee get more in the price of our cloth, comes out of all their purses that weare our cloth, which proving deare to them, will make them leave wearing it, and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der so large a vent as formerly.</p>
            <p>And I beleeve it will bee thought more beneficiall for a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth to vent store of their native commodities, at such lower, but moderate rates, as both Manufactors and Merchants may live thereby, though with lesse profit, than to sell a lesse quantitie at greater rates, the profit of the greater parcell in the whole excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:94293:29"/>
that of the lesser, especially so many men more being set a work untill we have other employment for them; and the rather it concernes us to sell good cheap, in that all other Nations now almost make cloth of their owne, or other cloathing<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> which may serve neere as well: So though it be granted that our moneyes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under-valued by exchange hinders importation and invites ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portation, which notwithstanding through severitie may be in part prevented; yet since under-v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>luing our coyne, wee get in making our moneyes home by exchange, and by that meanes can afford our cloth the cheaper, and so vent greater quantitie, the most benefici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all state is to be wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>hed for, which perhaps upon due scrutinie, may appeare to be this low exchange, in respect of the intrinsecall va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue of our moneyes, the rather for that though they were raised but to the pretended just paritie and pur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Besides stinting the Exchange may seeme lesse need full through this following consideration, which is, that as there was anciently no exchange at all by bils, so may we presuppose the like case at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, &amp; find that an English Merchant abroad may buy forrain com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities for money, or take them in barter agai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And yet I will farther adde in favour of this Table of rates for stinting the Exchange, that since the statute permits us not to take above eight <hi>per cent.</hi> for use or interest money, which is hoped (for the further quieting of Consciences and publick good) may yet be brought to 6 <hi>per</hi> 100. in regard as we sell our commodities cheaper or dearer, according to the long or short time wee give with them, or the partie to whom we sell, being of great or lesse credit and esteeme, and many desiring to put their money out at interest, somewhat under the statute, to a surer man, than at a high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er rate, to one whose credit or estate is not thought so good; evenn so is it in Exchanges, and I know not well how it can be helped, yet as the rate of intere<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>t is stinted to all alike, in such manner as none may take above the statute; so were it to be wished, that for usance single, double, or treble, they should not require of any above the rate of statute interest, which the Bankers or Exchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers will yet be able to counterminde by putting the price of the Exchange so much more in their favour, unlesse that bee stinted too: And this might seeme verie facile, if there were nothing in it save the prevention of transportating monies to and fro, and just as many Takers as Del<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>verers; for then he that desires no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but his monies in another place, if he can have as is likely, the just value according to the intrinsecall worth by Exchange re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives a great accommudation, and the price being once setled to remaine constant, needs onely look after the surest men to Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change withall; and a Merchant may likewise for same reason know sooner what he gets or loses by sale of his commodities, wherers now he cannot untill his monie be likewise made over through the uncertaintie of the Exchhange, which falling or rising still varies somewhat. But put the case I had urgent occasion to use 100 <hi>l.</hi> in <hi>Paris,</hi> and find no body that will take it by Exchange, if it be free for one to export it, or prohibited, but the danger or penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie not answerable to my expected profit, no doubt I may likely be moved to export it in <hi>specie</hi>: but if there be another who has the value of 100 <hi>l.</hi> in <hi>Paris,</hi> and equally desires his 100 <hi>l.</hi> pound here as I do mine in <hi>Paris,</hi> both of us alike understanding the true intrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secall value of the severall <hi>species,</hi> it is probable wee two shall quickly agree to exchange with one another, according to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all

               <hi>par</hi>: But if there be sundrie Takers and Deliverers, though equall on both sides, some whereof being over-hasty either in deliveting or taking, out of feare their turnes would not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise be served; this may cause the Exchange to rise or fall above or beneath the <hi>par</hi> on one side or other. But if there be more De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverers than Takers; that is, more monies to be delivered by Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change from <hi>London,</hi> then returned by Exchange to <hi>London,</hi> and that all yeare long, and for many yeares together, as hath beene most certaine in respect of <hi>England,</hi> with forraine parts, doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse the few Takers will have more opportunitye to stand upon their termes, in bringing the Exchange downe in their advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage by so much undervalutng of our monies: And though this be very obvious to any mans apprehention, yet it may be made fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther appeare so; thus:</p>
            <p>'Tis then first presuppos'd upon good ground as you have heard, that the undervalving of our monies by Exchange is prejudiciall to such as are deliverers of money by Exchange in <hi>London,</hi> and takes by Exchange abroad.</p>
            <p>Secondly, that these Takets abroad, and Deliverers here at home are strangers, is likewise presum'd; and</p>
            <p>Thirdly, that out of the sale and provenue of our goods exported there are great summes of mocey returned hither weekly from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad will as easily be granted.</p>
            <p>Now since this undervaluuing our moneyes by Exchange is one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dammagable to the Deliverers at home, and Takers abroad, and both these are strangers, why doe strangers deliver here in <hi>England,</hi> and take abroad by exchange thus to their losse? certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly nothing but necessity can force them to contiuue losers all yeare long for sundry years together: nor can there be any necessitie, had they not such store of monies, which they must necessarily deliver here, and that in far greater quantitie than wee have return'd us from abroad by sale of our goods exported.</p>
            <p>So then if it be granted, as well it may, that strangers have more monies to send away, than we have to bring into the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, though a Table of Rates were established as is propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, yet strangers would have the same or greater encouragement some times to export monies in <hi>specie</hi>; for whereas at present the Exchange being favourable to the Takers at home, and Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verers abroad which are Euglish, the English are moved through

               </gap>ies which the strangers must necessarily make over by Exchange, or send away in <hi>specie,</hi> for they have occasion to use them in other Countries: But this Table being setled in dammage and prejudice of the Takers at home, and Deliverers abroad being English, the English will forbeare to take at home, or deliuer by Exchange abroad, so that whereas stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers did form<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>rly export onely a part of their monies, they will now be constrained to convey away the whole: wherefore I will onely adde, that though this Table be setled for Exchanging, yet since there may, and that likely enough, as great necessity befall strang<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>rs to export monies notwithstanding, it will be altogether as requisite to practice exactest diligence alongst the Coast, and strictest penalties for preventing exportation of them; and if it prove by this meanes to be secured, then may this stinting Table be verie well forborne, in that the sting lies in the exportation of our monies, and the undervaluing them is the benefit of the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish, who are the Takers at home, and Deliverers abroad, and by the low Exchange at home, and high Exchange abroad enabled to sell their Cloth so much better cheap, and consequently, ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the greater quantitie, at last win the whole trade from other Nations.</p>
            <p>Since then as the scarcitie of every commodity makes it more to be esteemed, and yet money through want or plentie raises or deminishes the price of all things; in same manner doth it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominate the Exchange; for as the Takers and Deliverers of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney by Exchange doe over-ballance one another, so doth the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change rise or fall accordingly, as is demo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Others are of opinion, the exportation of our moneys might be hindred by raising them in <hi>Denomination,</hi> or embasing the allay; but if other Princes doe the like, wee are still where wee were: besides, this would encourage many private Mint-Masters in <hi>England,</hi> and Strangers to bring it from abroad, though not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether so much as brasse money, yet povertie and ruine would be the end of it; but had this latter motion taken effect, and greater <hi>Species</hi> beene once made currant, what through counterfeiting at home, and importing from abroad, it would in probabilitie so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orbitantly have encreased, untill brasse kettles had beene more worth than brasse money, by how much the workmanship of ket<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles is more costly.</p>

<q>That unlesse the fishing imployment and <hi>East India</hi> traffique be followed and enlarged, other Nations will gaine upon us, our trade infallibly decline daily, and the whole State with the same speede and paces post on to poverty and utter ruine.</q>
