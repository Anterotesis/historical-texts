         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

and others kept their rendevous, are all ſackt and burnt: they fly
at the voice of an Army in divers places. God granting peace in
England, there is no feare of War in Ireland.</p>

            <head>Iriſh Occurrences.</head>
            <p>THe certaine newes wee have, That laſt weeke on
Thurſday Captaine <hi>Barkley</hi> entred with his Pinace
and three more into the river of Tredagh, and found
it halfe barr'd with Boats, and a great chain, which
he ſuddenly burſt, and made that work uſeleſſe; The towne
is relieved with good ſtore of meale and other proviſion,
and Captaine <hi>Barkley</hi> came to Dublin on Wedneſday liſt;
but I muſt tell you, on his way homewards hee burnt the
towne called Skeris, and got there ſome plate and other
good ſtuffe.</p>
            <p>At the time of the reliefe, one Captaine <hi>Fox</hi> entred the
towne by permiſſion of Sir <hi>Henry Titchburne,</hi> with two
hundred men, and came as far as the high Croſſe, and there
proclaimed the towne was his; but in an inſtant Sir <hi>Henry
Titchburne</hi> gave him the ſalutation of a Souldier, for he and
all his men were laid dead on the place, and the reſt of the
Rebels durſt not venture any further. It is ſaid by thoſe that
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:63544:5"/>
left Dublin on Wedneſday laſt, That Sir <hi>Henry</hi> on Saturday
laſt ſallied out and killed three hundred. It may be ſo. Since
this, ſome Troops of Horſe went to Donboyne, ſeven miles
from Dublin, in Month; and burnt it; the mighty Generall
<hi>Fingalls</hi> not daring to venture his perſon in the reliefe: the
Souldiers brought from thence foure hundred Cowes, much
other Cattell, and much goods. Horſes are deere in Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blin,
yet two ſhillings will ſet hard to get a good Nagg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate
for two ſhillings ſix pence the ounce, a merry world
at Dublin.</p>
            <p>We have a Letter from Sir <hi>Maurice Euſtace.</hi> That a great
Party of Wickloe, Kildare, and Carlogh lye at Ratchcoole;
but thoſe that came forth on Wedneſday laſt here no ſuch
thing. Sir <hi>Charles Coote</hi> has been that way ſince, and hath
burnt Clandarkan neere Bellamount, a great towne, and
ſome other townes.</p>
            <p>From Munſter the intelligence is, the Lord <hi>Dungarvan</hi>
is landed with Armes and Munition, and is gone towards
the Fort of Duncannon, in hope to relieve it, wherein the
Lord <hi>Eſmund</hi> is, which if it be given up, will be a fault in
him, his ſon Sir <hi>Thomas Eſmund</hi> is turned Papiſt, and out
certainly in rebellion.</p>
            <p>The Lord Viſcount <hi>Mountgarret,</hi> and the Lord of Iker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryn,
and the reſt of the Lords, except <hi>Muſcrey</hi> and <hi>Roch,</hi>
are out in Munſter.</p>
            <p>Kilkenny hath taken it ſelfe, where my Lord <hi>Mountgar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret</hi>
is Governour for the Rebels.</p>
            <p>The Earle of Cork is at Yoghall with 600 Foot, and ſome
Horſe, to preſerve that place for the Engliſh landing.</p>
            <p>As for Waterſord it hath taken it ſelfe alſo.</p>
            <p>From Munſter, the Engliſh have ſent to Scotland to buy
2500 pounds Arms which are now with them. Wee have
no more newes from them. If we had ſome ſhips from the
coaſt of Munſter, they might prevent inconveniences, and
burne townes that are in rebellion. I know it will terrifie
them much, and put deſpaire in their minds, that ſuccours
cannot well come, but be taken.</p>
