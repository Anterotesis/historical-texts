            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE Consideration of the great Benefit and Use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness of History, of Ecclesiastical History especially, which affords us so many Illustrious Examples of true Vertue and Piety, and admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisheth us, that being compassed about with so great a Cloud of Witnesses, we run with Patience the Race that is set before us, may perhaps prevail with the Reader to excuse the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishing this brief Collection. That it might be the briefer, I have not transcribed at large the Texts of Scripture, which contain an Historical Account of the Places, and some of the Persons mentioned in it, but refer the Reader to them. In like manner I desire that he will consult D. <hi>Cave,</hi> as to the greatest part of the History of the Apostles, and some others; not repeating any thing that may be found in his Lives of the Apostles, and Apostolical Persons. For the same reason, I meddle not with the Niceties of Chronology or Geography; the Reader may (if he pleaseth) consult D. <hi>Cave</hi>'s Chronologi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Table, as to the one; and I commonly follow D. <hi>Heylin,</hi> in that which appertains to the other. For the same cause also I give an account only of Persons and Places. To have treated of the Doctrine, Discipline, Worship, and Government of the Church, together with the Sects, Heresies, Hereticks, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:98027:3"/>
which were in the three first Centuries, would have swell'd this Collection too much. When I alledge the Commentaries of the Ancient Writers and Others, I often do not mention the place, but by observing the Text of Scripture, which I refer to, it may be easily found. In alledging <hi>Josephus de bel. Jud.</hi> I follow the Greek, in which the Books and Chapters are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided otherwise than in our English Translation; and in some <hi>Latin</hi> ones. The example of <hi>Hegesippus</hi> may excuse the Style, of whom the Martyrology says <hi>April, 7. Simplici sermone texuit historiam, ut quorum vitam sectabatur dicendi quoque exprimeret charactere.</hi> If this Collection be so happy as to incite any to be followers of the Holy Persons mentioned in it, as they were of Christ, I have enough.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Ierusalem. Iosephus</hi> gives a large account of the destruction of it by <hi>Titus.</hi> The Christians in obedience to their Lords command, St. <hi>Luc.</hi> 21.20,21, and perhaps alarmed with the many Prodigies, which prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the City's Desolation; as also admonished by an Oracle delivered to some approved Persons among them, (as <hi>Euseb. l.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 5.) or by an Angel (as <hi>Epiphaen. de ponder. &amp; mens.</hi>) had departed out of it, <hi>Cestius Gallus</hi> having given them an opportunity of doing it, when having be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieged the City, he, without any visible reason, suddenly raised the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:98027:4"/>
Siege, at which time many of the <hi>Iews</hi> got out of it, as out of a Ship ready to sink; so <hi>Iosephus de bel. Iud. l.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 40. We are told by <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanius</hi> (<hi>ubi supra</hi>) that the Christians returned after a time; so that when <hi>Adrian</hi> the Emperor came to view the City, he found a few houses there, together with a Church. <hi>Adrian</hi> rebuilt it in part, taking in the place of our Saviours passion within the Walls, which was without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (<hi>v.</hi> S. <hi>Hieron. in loc. Act. Apost.</hi>) and calling it <hi>AElia.</hi> (see <hi>Dio. l.</hi> 69. and <hi>Euseb. in Chron.</hi>) And perhaps it is this which <hi>Dionysius in discript. orbis,</hi> calls <hi>Elais.</hi> In the front of the gate through which they went out to go to <hi>Bethlehem</hi> he caused a swine to be ingraved in marble (see <hi>Euseb.</hi> and <hi>Cassiodor. in Chron.</hi>) and forbad the <hi>Iews</hi> to come into the Country near it (though they came only as travellers and strangers;) yea they might not as much as behold it from an high place. (See <hi>Tertul contr. Iudaeos c.</hi> 13. <hi>Apologet. c.</hi> 21. <hi>Iustin Martyr Apol.</hi> 2. <hi>Euseb. l.</hi> 4. <hi>c.</hi> 6. <hi>Orosius l.</hi> 7. <hi>c.</hi> 13. <hi>Sulpit.

But he permitted the Christians (at the least those of the Gentiles) to inhabit there, who were renowned for the eminent Miracles of healing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> wrought by them, so that the Church begun to enjoy a flourishing condition; see <hi>Epiphan. ubi supra.</hi>

               <p>The <hi>Temple.</hi> If we will believe the <hi>Iews,</hi> St. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 2. 20. it was 46 years in building; but whether they spake this of <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Temple, (as <hi>Origen</hi> in St. <hi>Ioh.</hi>) or of <hi>Zerobabel</hi>'s (as <hi>Euseb. Demonstr. l.</hi> 8. <hi>Theophylact</hi> and <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thymius</hi>) or <hi>Herod</hi>'s (as others) it is not easy to determine.

Iud. l.</hi> 6. <hi>c.</hi> 24, 26. assures us, That <hi>Titus</hi> was utterly against the burning of it. Forty years before it was destroyed the doors of it flew open of their own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord (so the <hi>Gemara</hi> in <hi>Ioma fol.</hi> 39. 2.) which may countenance that which some say, That the doors of the Temple opened of themselves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the time of our Saviours Passion.

tells of the East-gate of the inner Temple, that, though it was so heavy that it could hardly be shut by 20 Men, it was seen to open of its own accord; and it may seem by him, that it was at the feast of the Passover that it did so. <hi>Dio. l.</hi> 6. relates that <hi>Adrian</hi> built a Temple to <hi>Iupiter,</hi> in the same place where the Temple of God was, (see also <hi>Sulpit. Sever. l.</hi> 2.) as others say that he set up his Statue where the Ark was, which Statue saith <hi>Nicephorus, l.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 24. if any Man call the abomination of desolation spoken of St. <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. he will not err much.

The Author <hi>de cardinal. oper. serm. de jejun. &amp; tentat.</hi> held that it was not really or by a local motion, that Jesus was carried and set on a Pinnacle of the Temple, but in spirit only, as <hi>Ezekiel</hi> was carried in the Spirit to <hi>Ierusalem</hi>; but others affirm that it was by a local motion. The Author <hi>oper. imperfect.</hi> seems to have thought, that he was not seen when he was carried into the Holy City and set on the Temple.</p>

The <hi>Talmudists</hi> dispute whether there were two Vails be ore the Holy of Holies or but one (<hi>Misna in Ioma c.</hi> 5. §. 1. and <hi>Gemar. fol.</hi> 51. 2.) and they seem to resolve, that there were two: But <hi>R. Iose</hi> said there was but one. Now whether it was this Vail before the Holy of Holies, called the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Vail <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. which was rent at our Saviours Passion, or the outer Vail which was before the Holy place, I shall not determine. <hi>Origin</hi> and <hi>S.

When <hi>Iosephus de bel.

But when in St. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 8. we read of Christs Speaking and Teaching in the Treasury, we are perhaps by Treasury there to understand, the whole Court in which those Chests were, and that as some suppose was the Court of the Women.</p>

He was tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented with a slow fire, which was inwardly raging, and yet the heat could not be perceived outwardly; his appetite was dog-like and insa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiable, his Feet swoln, his Bowels Ulcerous; Belchings, and those fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent and unsavoury, did much afflict him, together with intolerable Cholicks, difficulty of breathing, Contractions of the Nerves, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulsions over the whole Body; his natural parts were putrified and bred Worms; a very troublesome Itch all over, with a noisome stench, did grievously molest him; the torment and loathsomeness of his Disease made him once attempt to destroy himself. Add his extreme grief, for that he saw how all despised and hated him, and for the distractions of his Family, <hi>Antipater</hi> his eldest Son practising against his Life, and being put to Death by him, but five Days before that he himself ended his Life in most fearful rage and torment. <hi>Gregor. Abulpharaius</hi> says, that he suffered these Torments for two years together. It is observed by <hi>Ioseph. Ant. l.</hi> 18. <hi>c.</hi> 7. that though <hi>Herod</hi> had a very numerous issue, yet within one hundred years it was all extinct but a few; so little (saith he) doth either a multiplyed Issue or any Humane power or prevalence avail without Religion, and the fear of God.</p>

To which it may be answered, that before S. <hi>Iohn</hi>'s imprisonment, <hi>Herod</hi> was absent upon the account of his journey to <hi>Rome</hi>; during the time of it he was preparing for the War against <hi>Aretas,</hi> and perhaps also after S. <hi>Iohn</hi>'s Death; however the event of the War, and overthrow that he received, might then distract him. It might also be some reason of this, that Jesus was much in <hi>Galilee,</hi> and other parts more remote from the place of <hi>Herod</hi>'s residence, which at that time more especially was (as I suppose) <hi>Beraea.</hi> Add that which S. <hi>Chrysost.</hi> and <hi>Theophylact</hi> say, that Men in great places are usually taken up with other things, and less inquisitive after things of this nature. As also they that are about them neglect many times to acquaint them with those things which it concerns them most to know; see <hi>Lamprid. in Alexand. Sever.</hi> and <hi>Vopisc. in Aure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian.</hi> It is generally presumed that our Lord called this <hi>Herod</hi> a Fox.

It may also seem strange, that the Baptist should say of Christ, <hi>I knew him not,</hi> S.

among them; see <hi>Euthym.</hi> It may seem strange that there should be such a Multitude of Swine in these parts, Swines flesh being an Abomination to the <hi>Iews,</hi> and they that bred or kept them almost equally abominable; especially when they had in the time of <hi>Hyrcanus</hi> and <hi>Aristobulus,</hi> denoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced all that kept or bred them Accursed, so <hi>Gemar. in Bava Kama fol.</hi> 82. 2.

When they might sell their Swine to very vast profit to the <hi>Romans,</hi> to whom Swines flesh was a dainty; see <hi>Plin. l.</hi> 8. <hi>c.</hi> 51. <hi>Bashan was adorned with goodly Woods of Oaks,</hi> Isa. 2. 13.

                  <hi>a popular crime,</hi> and fell not under their cognizance.

sometimes denyed that they had power in Capital matters, as here in our Saviours case, sometimes pretended that they had, as in S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s case, <hi>Act.</hi> 24. 6. and therefore I see no reason why we should trouble our selves so much about this answer of theirs.

These Rules were not observed in the Death of Christ. The same <hi>Constitut. l.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 52. tells us, that among the Heathen, the Judge being about to give sentence, did with hands lifted up, protest that he was clear from the Blood of the Person; perhaps <hi>Pilate</hi> protested his Innocence by both washing his hands and lifting them up. Whereas S. <hi>Mark c.</hi> 15. 25. saith, that it was the third Hour, and they Crucified him, S. <hi>Ioh. c.</hi> 19. 14. that it was about the sixth Hour, when <hi>Pilate</hi> had not yet delivered up Jesus to be Crucified, S. <hi>Hieron.</hi> in <hi>Psal.</hi> 77. suspects that the Copies are vitiated in S. <hi>Mark,</hi> as <hi>Ammonius in caten. gr. in.

this, some tell us that the <hi>Iews</hi> divided the Day into four Parts (as it is clear that the <hi>Romans</hi> did; see <hi>Censorinus c.</hi> 23.) each of which contained three hours, so that the second of those Parts, into which the Day was divided, contained all the time from our Nine to our Twelve, and all that time they called the Third Hour; the third of those Parts, all the time from our Twelve to our Three afternoon, and this they called the Sixth Hour. Now if these things be true, and if our Saviours Cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixion was somewhat before our Twelve of Clock, then S. <hi>Mark</hi> might truly say, that it was the Third Hour, and S. <hi>Iohn</hi> as truly, that it was as it were the Sixth Hour.

which he beheld as a presage of his Death, as it had been before of his Advancement or Prosperity. Suddenly an hearty Grief siezeth him, with a vehement Griping, and extreme Torment in his bowels.

                  <hi>Certain Persons</hi> that went with S. <hi>Paul</hi> from <hi>Antioch</hi> to <hi>Ierusalem. Act.</hi> 15. 2. I conceive that they were some of the Brethren, and not of the <hi>Iewish</hi> Zealots or false Teachers mentioned <hi>v.</hi> 1. though it is possible that some of the Zealots also went up at the same time. For S. <hi>Hieron. ep.</hi> 11. <hi>inter epist. Augustini</hi> says, that both the accusers and the accused deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to go. The MS. <hi>Cant.

If S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s going up to <hi>Ierusalem</hi> mentioned here <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. was the same with that <hi>Act.</hi> 15. 2. then it is probable that <hi>Titus</hi> was one of those, who were sent by them of <hi>Antioch</hi> to <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> with S. <hi>Barnabas</hi> and S. <hi>Paul.</hi> S. <hi>Irenaeus l.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 13. some <hi>ap.</hi> S. <hi>Hieron.</hi> and <hi>Primasius</hi> were of Opinion, that it was the same with that <hi>Act.</hi> 15. but
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:98027:39"/>
S. <hi>Chrysost.</hi> and <hi>Epiphan. Haer.</hi> 28. do dissent. S. <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. that he went up by Revelation, when as <hi>Act.</hi> 15. it is said that he was sent up by the Church of <hi>Antioch,</hi> therefore it may seem not to be one and the same going up which is spoken of in those places. But to this it may be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered, First, that he might be sent up by the Church, and yet incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged also to the Journey by a particular Revelation; or secondly, the Church might be directed by Revelation, to take that course, <hi>i. e.</hi> to send S. <hi>Paul</hi> and Others to <hi>Ierusalem.</hi> It was the Opinion of the <hi>Incertus Autor ap.</hi> S. <hi>Hieron.</hi> and also of some mentioned by S. <hi>Hieron.</hi> himself, that <hi>Titus</hi> was Circumcised, (see also <hi>Primas.</hi>) but S. <hi>Ambros. Theodoret,</hi> S. <hi>Hieron. &amp;c.</hi> were of Opinion that he was not. S. <hi>Hieron.</hi> also acquaints us what it was that misled those that conceived that he was Circumcised, <hi>viz.</hi> when we read, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 5. <hi>To whom we gave place by Subjection, no not for an hour,</hi> they left out the Negative, and read thus, <hi>To whom we gave place by Subjection for an hour</hi>; and it is true, that S. <hi>Irenaeus l.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 13. S. <hi>Ambros.</hi> the <hi>Latin</hi> Copy alledged by S. <hi>Hieron.</hi> and the Copies which <hi>Primas.</hi> consulted, did follow this latter reading, and <hi>Tertull. contr. Marc. l.</hi> 5. <hi>c.</hi> 3. earnestly contends for it. But on the other hand the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi> Copies which we have now; and so <hi>Theodoret, Epiphan. Haer.</hi> 28. the <hi>Syr. Arab.</hi> and <hi>AEthiop.</hi> have the Negative, and read to the same sense that we do; so did also the <hi>Greek</hi> Copies in S. <hi>Hierom</hi>'s time. But sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose that S. <hi>Paul</hi> did write thus, <hi>To whom we gave place for an hour,</hi> it doth not follow that he gave place so far as to Circumcise <hi>Titus.</hi> S. <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron. ad Hedib.
