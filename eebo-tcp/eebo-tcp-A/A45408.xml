            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>I Laid me down and ſlept, and
roſe up again, and the Lord
ſuſtained me, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 3. 5.</p>
                  <p>I. As ſoon as you open
your eyes,<note place="margin">Pſal. 121. 1.</note> lift them
up unto the Hills from
whence cometh your help, and
<hi>begin</hi> the work of the day with
thankſgiving to God, who hath
delivered you from the dangers of
the forepaſſed night, refreſhed
your weary body with quiet ſleep,
and brought you ſafely to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of another day.</p>
                  <p>II. Conſider, That perhaps many
others, no <hi>worſe</hi> than you, have
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:55239:28"/>
this night been hurried from their
beds to the bar of Judgment, and
there received a ſad ſentence of
eternal woe; yet God of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
and undeſerved goodneſs
hath <hi>ſpared</hi> you until now, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
and prepare your accounts.</p>
                  <p>III. Return him all poſſible <hi>thanks</hi>
and praiſe for this ineſtimable
mercy: and commend your ſelf
to his <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>protection</hi> for the
following day, and the reſt of
your life; humbly beſeeching him
to continue his mercy and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
to you, in preſerving you
from all evils, and ſupplying you
with all <hi>neccſſaries</hi> ſpiritual and
temporal; and implore his Grace
to guide and direct you in all your
undertakings and actions, as may

great Name, and the good of your

                  <p>IV. Conſider what ſin or ſins you

you, to avoid <hi>thoſe</hi> ſins, and
all occaſions of them.</p>
                  <p>V. Conſider what you have to <hi>do</hi>
this day: Reſolve, not to ſpend
it in <hi>idleneſs</hi> or <hi>evil</hi> imployments;
and be careful to undertake no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
in which you cannot with

not to return <hi>preſently:</hi> for
the longer you go forward, the

farther you have back again, and
the leſs <hi>time</hi> left for that and the

                  <p>VII. Be careful of your precious
<hi>Time,</hi> that you do not <hi>loſe</hi> it in
doing nothing, or <hi>caſt</hi> it away on
that which is worſe: for you
know not how ſoon you may be
called to <hi>account</hi> for every idle and

                  <p>Reſolve to ſpend this day as
that which, for ought you know,
may be your <hi>laſt:</hi> and remember,
that as the Night, ſo <hi>Death</hi> draws

overtake you before Mid-day.</p>

vouchſafe ſtill to continue his

               <p>In which you may proceed by
theſe ſeveral ſteps.</p>
               <p>I. Take an exect ſurvey of the

               <p>Recollect and reckon up <hi>parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly,</hi>

               <p>

               <p>Implore his mercy and <hi>pardon</hi>
in the merits and ſatisfaction of
his dear Son Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>V. Offer up your ſelf wholly into
his hands with a promiſe and vow
of <hi>new</hi> life, and more diligent
performance of your duty.</p>
               <p>And deſire the <hi>gracious</hi> in flu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence

you to make <hi>reſtitution</hi> or ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
to God for the wrongs and
affronts which in every ſingle ſin
you have offered to his Glory;
yet to ſhew the <hi>ſincerity</hi> and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs

upon thoſe ſins of which you have
been moſt gulity, by ſetting your
ſelf moſt zealouſly to the practice
of the contrary vertues.</p>

with the world:</p>
               <p>By making <hi>reſtitution</hi> and ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction

as it were ſhut up in this pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of the Body, can receive little
information or affection but what
is conveyed to them by the Senſe,
it hath pleaſed him to accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date

               <p>Such are <hi>Looking up</hi> toward

and ſuch is the receiving of
<hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine</hi> in this other, of
which we ſpeak.</p>
               <p>For though the eating of Bread
and drinking of Wine are in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
actions ſo very ordinary,
that they are alſo very inconſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable;
yet in this they are made
uſe of to <hi>ſignifie</hi> to us the moſt

<pb n="132" facs="tcp:55239:72"/>
that ever the Great King of
Heaven beſtowed upon his poor
Subjects and Servants here on
earth. For,</p>
               <p>I. It is the <hi>Commemoration</hi> of the
<hi>death</hi> of his own only Son for the
<hi>redemption</hi> of loſt Mankind; the
wounding of his body ſignified by
the breaking of Bread, and the
ſhedding of his Bloud by the
pouring out of Wine.</p>
               <p>II. Beſides this, it is alſo an Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of Gods <hi>reconciliation</hi> and
favour to us, and demonſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that we are in <hi>League</hi> and
Amity with him, in that we are
admitted to his own Table, to
eat of his Bread, and drink of his
Cup.</p>
               <p>III. It is a means and inſtrument of

               <p>
                  <pb n="133" facs="tcp:55239:72"/>IV. It is our <hi>Sacrifice</hi> of praiſe and

the good things of this

               <p>THis then being a Service ſo
acceptable to God and ſo
beneficial, ſo neceſſary for men,
it were but reaſon to expect that
all good Chriſtians would ſhew
themſelves ready and forward to
the performance of it.</p>
               <p>And accordingly in the firſt
Age of the Church, when Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
and Zeal were in their youth
and vigour, it was the good cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom
to celebrate this Sacrament
(if not <hi>every day</hi> as it is thought,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:55239:73"/>
yet at leaſt) every Lords day.</p>
               <p>But afterward as Piety began
to grow more dull, and Love
more cold, it was by little and
little brought down to once a
Month.</p>
               <p>And this Order ſtill remains in
the Church of God, (though
now ſomewhat diſturbed by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing
Sectaries among us.) And
at thoſe times the Supper is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
to be made ready, and
the Table furniſhed for all ſuch
as can think fit to ſpare ſo much
time from their worldly buſineſs,
to come to the Marriage-feaſt of
the great King of Heaven. For
herein they are yet left to more
liberty, and not neceſſarily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
to come oftner than thrice
a year.</p>
               <p>And truly ſuch is the negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
of many (who yet would
be accounted Chriſtians) that
they are not aſhamed to ſtretch
this libetty to the utmoſt. Yea,
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:55239:73"/>
and it were well if even then they
would come meetly provided,
and had not more reſpect to the
Shame of the World, than to the
Honour of God, or their own
Good.</p>
               <p>Certainly any ſober Chriſtian
cannot conſider without ſhame
and indignation how much Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
are fallen from their firſt
love.</p>
               <p>But that which is ordinarily
brought for an <hi>excuſe,</hi> is in it ſelf
ſo unworthy and unreaſonable,
that it makes this Neglect yet
more abominable and intolerable.</p>
               <p>And indeed it is ſomewhat
worſe than that for which thoſe
invited in the Goſpel
received a ſevere Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.<note place="margin">Mat. 22.</note>
There it was,<note place="margin">Luke 14. 18, 19, 20.</note>

                  <pb n="136" facs="tcp:55239:74"/>
and <hi>therefore they could not come.</hi>
But here one is engaged in ſuch a
<hi>ſin,</hi> which he hath no mind to
leave yet; another is not in <hi>cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity;</hi>
and in general they are not
<hi>prepared,</hi> and therefore they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not,
that is, they will not come.</p>
               <p>Such is the ridiculous madneſs
of men in this barbarous and bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh
Age, that they can think fit
to excuſe and juſtifie one fault by
pretending more and greater.</p>
               <p>But if you are not prepared to
meet your Saviour at his Table,
to celebrate the memorial of his
Mercy how would you appear
before him at his Seat of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
to which yet you know not
but you may be ſooner called?</p>
               <p>If therefore you could wiſh to
be always provided for Death,
which often comes ſuddenly, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
<hi>uncertainly,</hi> think not much
to beſtow a little time in prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
your ſelf for this Sacrament,
as often as you may have an
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:55239:74"/>
opportunity of receiving it.</p>
               <p>And thoſe which in theſe days
of Captivity have not that conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience
of receiving from the
hands of them who have <hi>authority</hi>
to give it, may yet do well not
to omit the Duty of Preparation.
Let them do that which they can,
and for that which they cannot
God will accept the will for the

               <p>THE beſt <hi>Preparation</hi> to this

meditation upon Heaven and

the great mercies of God in the

               <p>But becauſe the minds of men

               <p>AND now I cannot think
any Concluſion more <hi>fit</hi> and
proper for this daily courſe of
Devout Life, than a ſhort medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
on that which ſhall be the
<hi>Concluſion</hi> of Life it ſelf.</p>
               <p>I. Firſt therefore, conſider the

That <hi>our days conſume
in vanity, and our years</hi> Pſal.
<hi>in trouble;</hi> That our
whole Life is but as a Dream,
and when Death awakes us, we
find our hands empty of all that
which hath coſt us ſo much la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
and travel, and ſorrow,
and ſin.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="158" facs="tcp:55239:85"/>II. Remember the ſwiftneſs and

our <hi>flouriſhing</hi> but as a <hi>flower of the

plucked up, yet ſoon withers of
it ſelf, and falls away.</p>
               <p>The Young may dye ſoon, but
the Old cannot live long.</p>
               <p>III. Remember that in this <hi>ſhort</hi>
life, we are yet to provide for an
<hi>Eternity</hi> either of weal or woe;
and therefore cannot be too care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
how we ſpend every minute of
that upon which depends a matter
of ſo great, ſo laſting impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</p>
               <p>IV. There is but one way of Birth,

devided into ſo many Sects

the Ark of <hi>Noah,</hi> filled withall

and, to complete our miſery and

badge of Diſcipleſhip which thou

that we have abundantly
taſted of this patience and lenity
of thine. To what an enormous
height were our ſins arrived ere
thou beganſt to viſit them! and
when thou couldſt no longer for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear,
yet maſtering thy power,
thou haſt not proportioned thy
vengeance to our crimes, but to
thy own gracious deſign of redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing,
and reclaiming us. Lord,
had the firſt ſtroke of thy hand
been exterminating, our guilts
had juſtified the method; but thou
haſt proceeded by ſuch eaſie and
gentle degrees, as witneſs how
much thou deſiredſt to be inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted,
and ſhew us, that all that
ſad weight we have long groaned
under, hath been accumulated on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by our own incorrigibleneſs.
'Tis now, O Lord, theſe many
years that this Nation hath been
in the Furnace, and yet our droſs
waſtes not, but encreaſes; and it
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:55239:104"/>
is owing only to thy unſpeakable
mercy, that we, who would not be
purified, are not conſumed; that
we remain a Nation, who ceaſe
not to be moſt ſinful, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voking
Nation. O Lord, let not
this long-ſuffering of thine ſerve
only to upbraid our obſtinacy,
and inhanſe our guilt; but let it
at laſt have the proper effect on
us, melt our hearts, and lead us
to repentance. And Oh, that this
may be the day for us thus to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
the things that belong to our
peace! that all who are (yea, and
all who are not) caſt down this
day in an external humiliation,
may by the operation of thy migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

before thee in a ſincere con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition!
O thou who canſt out of

unto <hi>Abraham,</hi> work our ſtony

temporal and eternal ruine; but
in ſtead of our mutinous com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining
at the puniſhments of our
ſins, ſearch and try our ways, and
turn again to the Lord. O be thou
pleaſed to grant us this one grand
fundamental mercy, that we who
ſo impatiently thirſt after a
change without us, may render
that poſſible and ſafe by this bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
and more neceſſary change
within us; that our ſins may not,
as they have ſo often done, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
and eclipſe that light which
now begins to break out upon us.
Lord, thy Dove ſeems to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
us with an olive-branch in
her mouth, oh let not our filth and
noiſomneſs chaſe her away; but
grant us that true repentance
which may atone thee, and that
Chriſtian charity which may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile
us with one another.
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:55239:105"/>
Lord, let not our breach either
with thee or among our ſelves be
incurable, but by making up the
firſt prepare us for the healing of
the latter. And becauſe, O Lord,
the way to make us one fold is to
have one Shepherd, be pleaſed to
put us all under the conduct of
him to whom that charge belongs;
bow the hearts of this people as of
one man, that the only contention
may be who ſhall moſt forward
in bringing back our <hi>David.</hi> O
let none reflect on their paſt guilts
as an argument to perſevere, but
repent, and to make their return
ſo ſincere as may qualifie them
not only for his but thy Mercy.
And, Lord, be pleaſed ſo to guide
the hearts of all who ſhall be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted
with that great concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of ſetling this Nation, that
they may weigh all their delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
in the balance of the Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary,
that conſcience, not intereſt,
may be the ruling principle, and
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:55239:106"/>
that they may render to <hi>Ceſar</hi> the
things that are <hi>Ceſars,</hi> and to
God the things that are Gods;
that they may become healers of
our breaches and happy repair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
of the ſad ruines both in

Lord, that as thoſe ſins which
made them are become National,
ſo the repentance may be Nation<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al

proper fruits of it, by zeal of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoring
of the rights both of thee
and thine Anointed. And do thou,
O Lord, ſo diſpoſe all hearts, and
remove all obſtacles, that none
may have the will, much leſs the
power, to hinder his peaceable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution.
And, Lord, let him
bring with him an heart ſo entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
devoted to thee, that he may
wiſh his own honour only as a
means to advance thine. O let the
precepts and example of his Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
Father never depart from his
mind; and as thou wert pleaſed
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:55239:106"/>
to perfect the one by ſuffering, ſo
perfect the other by acting thy
will; that He may be a bleſſed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument

vertue in a prophane and almoſt

O let him come a great but happy

and by his example as a
