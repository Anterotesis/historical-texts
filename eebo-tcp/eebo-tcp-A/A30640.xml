            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>Mr. BURTONS SERMON Preached before the <hi>Parliament, Iune</hi> 20. 1641.</head>
            <p>OH how my Soule is ravished, as not to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin the opening of my mouth without bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of God, who hath not onely binn pleased as this very moneth 4 yeares agoe, to cal me to preach in another kind of Pulpit, not far from this place; but hath also cald me now to speake un<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>to you at this time, in this place, even as it follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and is written in <hi>Psal.</hi> 53.7, 8. which I beseech you give attention unto, the words of the Text are these.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Oh that the salvation of Israel were come out of Sion, Oh that the Lord would deliver his people out of Captivity, Then shall Iacob reioyce, and Israel shall be glad.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The last Verse of this Psalme is a Prayer for a Prophesie, and in the maine it is already fulfilled, for it points at Christ, the great Saviour, and by him salvation is already come, and that salvation whereof Jacob reioyces, and Israel is glad, how sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable therefore will it be for us at this time to speake of this Prophesie, being for the main I say, already fulfilled; but though for the maine<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet not for the whole. The worke of Salvation is accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished by Christ, in respect of his death, the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:94014:3"/>
and efficacy of it, but there remaines still a great part of it; as unfulfilled to the Church of God, in the severall ages of it, by way of applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Prophesie; Gods people have bin sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to Captivity, to bondage in this world, as you shall see hereafter, and therefore it is not in <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ai<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e that now I should speake of these words, <hi>Oh that the salvation were come unto Israel, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here in this Psalme are observed generally these two parts.</p>
            <p>The first is that which is contained in the former verses, wherein is set forth unto us the nature, of the Enemies of the Church of God: for in the very front of it, stands the great whor that hardens hearts. They doe not know God, and then it is in the Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses following, that they were full of fowle and wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed conditions and qualities, as you may read all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long the Psalme; they were corrupt, abominable<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> no good at all in them; God hunts them out and finds them so<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they were back-sliding, they were altogether filthy, they have no knowledge of God, they eat up Gods people as bread, they call not upon God, they incampe against him; but he dismounts them, &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founds them.</p>
            <p>And then secondly followes the sequell of this, what it behoves the people of God to doe in this case: incompassed about, and encamped against by so many enemies, even as <hi>David</hi> here, <hi>Oh that the Salvation were come out of Sion</hi>: so that I may compare this Psalme to <hi>Rebecca'es</hi> wombe, that had two Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in it, here be the Nations of the wicked <hi>Esau,</hi> and of righteous <hi>Iacob,</hi> when the Lord shall bring backe the Captivity of his People, <hi>Iacob shall rejoyce, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:94014:3"/>In which words observe these two Branches.</p>
            <p>First the condition of Gods people under affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, under persecution, under captivity, and bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage; <hi>O that the salvation,</hi> that is, O that deliverance, of the children of <hi>Israel</hi> from Captivity, were come out of <hi>Sion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The second is, the condition of Gods people, delivered out of Captivity, and saved by the Lord, and that is, they rejoyce and are glad.</p>
            <p>For the manner of the speech here in the former part, that I shall insist upon at this time, if the time will give me leave to follow it, which I will contract as much as may be.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Oh that the salvation of Israel were come out of Sion.</hi> The Hebrew phrase is, who shall give salvation out of Sion; it is a usuall phrase in scripture, who shal give, that is, <hi>Vtinam,</hi> I would to God, oh that God would give salvation out of Sion, I shall not need here to open the words much: Salvation, it is deliverance, Deliverance here from Captivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and Bondage: Sion it was the place of GODS habitation: Of old the Arke was a tipe of Gods presence, a type of Christ, &amp; it was a type of Heaven, our eyes are lifted up towards Heaven, from whence commeth our helpe: Israel the people of God, the people of God that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed with him, that prevailed with God, as the Scripture tels us.</p>
            <p>To come briefly to the point of observation from these words; they doe import unto us an ardent affection, which broke forth from that holy man <hi>David,</hi> in wishing the good of the people of God, <hi>Oh that the Salvation of</hi> Israel <hi>were come out of Sion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:94014:4"/>It is a very patheticall expression, I say of a heart full of fervency, and zeale, and ardent love of the people of God, and from hence this point will arise for our instruction.</p>
            <p>That it behoveth all the People of God to be thus affected, as <hi>David</hi> was, to have their heart possessed with an ardent affection, and compassion towards the Church of God, and especially when it lyes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Captivity and Bondage, Affliction and Persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the world.</p>
            <p>This was indeed admirable in <hi>David,</hi> to see <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> an affection in a King, and a Prince, such a great man as he was; we see at his bringing backe the Ark, he was not disheartned by his wives mocking him, but answered againe, if this be too be vile I will yet be more vile; this he did in bringing the Arke un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Mount Sion, see <hi>Psal.</hi> 16, 2. My goods, or my goodnesse extendeth not unto thee O Lord, but to thy Saints that are on earth, and to the excellent, in whom is all my delight. All <hi>Davids</hi> delight, it was in the Saints on Earth, upon the Church of God, yea <hi>David</hi> was so ravished with the love of Gods people, that hee desired no other happinesse then that, that he should enjoy in the people of God, <hi>Psal<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> 106.4. Remember me O Lord saith hee with the loving kindnesse of thy people: hee desired no other favour of God, but that which he dealt to his people: and so visit me with thy Salvation: to what end would <hi>David</hi> have a part in Salvation, that I may see thy peoples salvation, and that I may rejoyce in thy inheritance, here was the utmost and highest degree of <hi>Davids</hi> desire, that hee might bee pertaker of the happinesse of Gods people, that he might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:94014:4"/>
in their good. And so <hi>Moses</hi> was so taken with the love of Gods people, that hee forgot himselfe, and S. <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 9.12. I could wish<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> saith hee, that I were <hi>Anathema</hi> from Christ, for my Brethrens sake, and so the Prophet <hi>Esay,</hi> 59.1. For Sions sake I will not hold my tongue. and for <hi>Ierusalems</hi> sake I will not be silent, untill the Righteousnesse thereof breake forth like a morning Lampe: And beloved, this is indeed the naturall affection of the people of God; it is naturall and proper unto every child of God, thus to bee affected, and ravished with the Church of God: as above all things in the world to wish the good and welfare of it, when it lyes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the waves and billowes of Affliction, as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle saith, we must weepe with them that weepe, rejoyce with them that rejoyce, to be of like affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: and surely beloved we have many motives and reasons to induce us, and incite us to the love of the Church of God, we have besides, the example of the Saints.</p>
            <p>First the example of God himselfe, the Father, who from everlasting hath so loved the Church, that he did from everlasting, choose it for his owne, Predestinated them to salvation, gave Christ for them, gave him up to death for them, as the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture saith, Hee so loved the world that hee gave his onely begotten Son; that all that believed on him should not perish, but have Life everlasting, hee would not have any of his perish, but all saved, though it cost him the death of his owne sonne, such was his Bowels of Mercy and compassion to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them.</p>
            <p>Secondly of the Love of Jesus Christ, the sonne
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:94014:5"/>
of God, though hee was sent of the Father, yet it was his owne good will that he gave his life for the Church, shed his blood for it, when hee put our hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine nature upon him, that he might learne to have compassion on our infirmities, and out of that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion save us, yea there was so much of that <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanthropos,</hi> love of man in Christ, that hee wept over the Jewes, because of the hardnesse of their hearts, because they would not give eare to his word, nor believe in him, hee wept for the destruction com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming upon them.</p>
            <p>Againe in the third place, a third reason may bee taken from the consideration of the Church of God why we should love her, and be well affected to her, when we behold the Church cloathed with the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse of Christ, shining out in those many bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailes of Heaven, and if we consider our relation to the Church of God, in relation to Christ himself, being his members, his spouse, his sister, and every way so beautifull, even so as Christ himselfe is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vished with her love, as yee may read <hi>Cant.</hi> 4. And so in her Innocence, it is Christ in her selfe, it is none of her owne, but by Christ, the Church of God is made so innocent, that she is without spot or wrinckle, so noble, so excellent, and so glorious, &amp; so highly in favour with God, and with Christ<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> now to see her lye under bondage and captivity, that she that is freed by Christ, should bee a Captive or a slave, who can but bee affected therewith. Wee doe compassionate those that are great men, especially the high borne, that are in bondage, we pitty the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Lamb that is among Wolves, the Dove among dogs, and the Lilly that is crushed with Thornes,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:94014:5"/>
more then all these is the Church of God, a poore Lamb, an innocent Dove, a spotlesse Lilly, when therefore shee is in this case, it should move us to compassion.</p>
            <p>Again, another reason is taken from our selves, we all desire to be of this Church of God, to be in the very midst of this Assembly of the Church, then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved wee must bee of the same mind and affection with the Church of God, of the same spirit, to weep for it when occasion serves, and herin stands our hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse, when we affect the Church of God. <hi>Psal.</hi> 122 <hi>Pray for the Peace of Ierusalem,</hi> that is the Church of God, they shall prosper that love her, see how the spirit turnes to those that love her, <hi>pray for the Peace of Ierusalem, peace be within thy wals, and prosperity within thy Pallaces</hi>: and surely beloved, if the voyce of eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Christian should thus resolve with it selfe, I desire to enjoy no liberty, no mercy of God my selfe, which I do not enjoy in common with the Church of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> this is that makes every blessing to bee indeed a bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, when we doe injoy it, not alone with our selves in particular, but with the Church, and when such a Land hath bin in Captivity, as here in my Text, when they are restored to their land, and to their liberty, and see the Land rejoyce with them also, what a great Mercy is this of God, and what abundant matter of Joy doth it afford unto those that are thus well af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, thats the fourth reason.</p>
            <p>A fifth motive why wee must love the Church of God may be taken from the consideration of the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity and bondage which here my Text hath relation to. The Psalmist doth rejoyce at the deliverance of the Church of God, because they were in captivity.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:94014:6"/>Captivity; It takes away a mans heart and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever is good in him, we see what it hath done in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Countries, in Turkie, and many other places, where men lye under Captivity, what slaves are they, and in what miserable cases are they; Againe, if we consider Captivity in the kinds of it, either of the body or of the soule, or of the conscience, It is a miserable thing, in any of these to be in bondage, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed we are all by nature borne slaves under the bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage of Sin and Satan, but from this. Christ hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered his people, there is also a bondage of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>science even many times of those people that are the children of Christ, and that is under the servitude of humane inventions, if it be a bondage of the body, it may have a dependancie upon the bondage of the conscie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, when the godly doe refuse to subscribe to mens devises in the worship of God, then they are sent to Captivity of their bodies or else when men doe suffer their goods to be lost for it, either of these kinds of bondage are the worst kinds in the world, how many thousands of christians, since England hath fallen out with God have bin devowred by these lyons, as it is in the Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicles, when the Children of Israel set up their Idols, then Gods sent lyons amongst them, to devowr them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and destroy them; when England began to set up hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane devises to corrupt the worship, and service of God, God sent lyons amongst us, (but thanks be to God) at this time they are obiects of our pitty; and compassion; and it hath pleased God to move this honourable assembly to take into their harts the mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable condition of those that were thus captivated, even so when wee see Gods Church in Captivity, it should make us be affected with it, it should make
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:94014:6"/>
our Bowels earne over them, with a desire of their freedome.</p>
            <p>And then againe in respect of the deliverance, it is glorious and honourable, as in all times when God delivers his people, he doth it with honour; so when God delivered his children out of Egypt, it was with honour in the face of all the World: and so Christs delivering us from sin, and from Sathan, how glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious was it, even when he hung on the Crosse, he did on that Crosse by his death triumph over the Divell, and over his Kingdome, by the powring out of his blood, he did work a glorious deliverance, and as a glorious deliverance to the deliverer, so to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of slaves men were made the servants of God, of bond men, adopted to be his children.</p>
            <p>Well, in the next place, another reason may be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from the great punishment, which God inflicts upon those, who are not onely the oppressors, of his people, but the detainers of them that exercise vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence over them, we see this in the Egyptians, they not onely kept the children of Israel in bondage, but when God sent a message to them to deliver his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, they put more Captivity upon them, they rais'd their tale of brick well, but you see how God deales with them, he sends frogs to cover Egypt, and they came into the Kings Chambers, and when they were gon away, they filled the Land with stinke, and so GOD sent grasse-hoppers to devoure their fruits, and he smote their first-borne, and yet they would not be satisfied to suffer the people to depart, but when the Israelites were gone, they repented of it, and God overthrowes them in the red sea: if you looke for more Examples then these, perhaps you
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:94014:7"/>
shall find them nearer hand, neerer home, I am sure we may say there are more Egypts then one, for wee read, <hi>Revel.</hi> 11. <hi>That the two witnesses lay dead in the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> which is spiritually called Egypt, and <hi>Sodome,</hi> so that there is a spirituall Egypt, as well as a naturall Egypt; now perhaps wee may find this very Egypt, where ever we finde the oppressors of Gods people, where Gods witnesses and people are persecuted, or holden in contempt, certainely that is a spirituall E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt: and beloved is this land free? may we not find a spirituall Egypt amongst us, Frogs, who are they but Jesuits, Priests, and Friers, these spread over the Land, never the like, as in these last dayes: when the frogs were gone, then came locusts and Grasse-hop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, these crept into the Kings Chambers, in Cities, into all places, spared none, and what say we of cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpillars, who came in Armies into our land, Irish<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Catterpillars, and English Catterpillars, that h<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ve devoured the fruits of the Land, and the strength thereof: but we must thanke the Worthies of our Kingdome for scattering these. And what say wee then to the darkenesse that was upon Egypt? is not the like in England? surely a wonderfull, and a pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable darknesse, when they cannot see at noone day, when they were given over to that hardnesse of heart, and that also in oppressing of GODS People, that to this day they cannot see themselves. So that after so many thousand yeares, we may finde some E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptians, that farre exceed Pharaoh in hardnesse of heart, for he did confesse his sin, and did deprecate God to pardon it, but our Egyptians can finde no fault with themselves.</p>
            <p>Againe, what say wee to the <hi>primogeniti</hi> of the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:94014:7"/>
first-borne in Egypt; after the first-borne of Egypt were slain, the Children of Israell were delivered, David calls them the Chiefe of Egypt. I speake of the chiefest of these Incendiaries, do wee not see them smitten off, in the late Vote against them, and for the destroying of them; Certainly <hi>primogeniti</hi> being ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away, we may well hope for a glorious delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, upon the Church of God. The Children of God have not yet deliverance, but they shall have it. I will not pursue these men to the red Sea, but surely if they doe not repent, God hath a Sea, a Sea of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction to swallow them up.</p>
            <p>Thus we see in respect of the punishment God doth send on the wicked, that doe detaine his people in bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, we ought to be well affected to the Church of God, and especially when he calls his people to doe justice, and to deliver his people, for when the Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians make a violent detaining of Gods people, what can be expected but Plague upon Plague, upon the Egyptians?</p>
            <p>But now to speake a word of the last reason, and that is the consideration of the meanes that is here committed unto us, by which it pleaseth God still to deliver his people, and that is by Prayer: oh that some would deliver the people of God, who shall give salvation unto Israel? here you see was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but a bare wish, yet out of a sound heart, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passionate of the Captivity of GODS Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; who shall give deliverance unto GODS People; This is the time wherein God doth begin to deliver his People, when Gods people begin to cry, and to seeke, then he begins to heare, In the 2 of <hi>Exodus,</hi> the Lord tels <hi>Moses</hi> they sighed for their
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:94014:8"/>
burthens, and in the third chapter saith, I have heard the cryes of the People, and their sighings, here was the first instance that God was pleased to take, to send <hi>Moses</hi> to deliver his people, when their brickes were doubled, then <hi>Moses</hi> was, I say, sent to deliver them, so then here is the 7th reason that God is moved to compassionate his people with a Prayer, or a cry: when nothing else will deliver us, prayers and teares will. But againe, when the children of Israel were in Bondage, God sent them another cause of delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, when they were brought to the lowest ebbe, to the greatest misery, as you see, <hi>Deut.</hi> 23.3. There the Lord saith of his people, that when they shall bee brought low, when all their strength was gone, and there is no hope to prevaile, then hee will deliver them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. On the other side, when the enemies of God are advanced to the height, and to the pitch of all their pride, and all their cruelty, then this is a time that doth fore-run their destruction, so God served the <hi>Amorites,</hi> when their sins were full, they gave way to the people of God to take possession of their lands, and so you may read, <hi>Esay</hi> 10.10. where the Lord speakes, upbraiding of <hi>Assyria,</hi> for oppressing his people, thus he doth argue the case with them, and thereupon their destruction comes, and so when the Babylonian lifted up himselfe above the Throne of God, as high as the star called <hi>Lucifer,</hi> trampled upon the people of God, and spoyled the Nations: thereupon the Lord threatens the destruction of the Nation, even of that whole Kingdome, and so <hi>Ier.</hi> 57 <hi>My blood be upon the inhabitants of Caldea,</hi> shall Israel say, I will deliver them saith God, take vengeance for
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:94014:8"/>
them, and dry up their Sea.</p>
            <p>Thus wee see as on the one side, the extremity of Gods people, even a sigh to God, moves him to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion, so on the other side, the height of pride doth bring upon them destruction.</p>
            <p>But some may say, wee see that though there were but a few of them that were principall agents in E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt, yet God brought the ruine on the whole Land, may he not doe the like on this?</p>
            <p>God forbid that a faction should bring a Nation to ruine, and here is our comfort yet, that in all the evils this land hath laid under, and under which espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially Gods people have groaned a long time, yet the whole land, and the body of it now assembled, have laboured to suppresse them, and laboured for a refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation; so this is that doth exceedingly comfort us, and secure us; that however that damnable faction of Egypt hath binne extreame cruel and proud, and passed beyond the bounds and limits of humanity, yet God will spare the Land, and the evils will fall on themselves, thats our comfort I say.</p>
            <p>But here is another thing to be considered, and that is a further degree of satisfaction; for wee must not thinke this enough, Ah I doe wish or desire, like him in the Comedy, that lay stretching on the grasse, in harvest time, wishing that were to worke in Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vest, but this cry is full of efficacy, full of Vigour, It puts it selfe forth by all meanes to seeke for delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance; for when God sends deliverance of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple from bondage and Captivity, This wish of theirs stayes not at a Petition, but it puts forth all the Vertue of it, to put in execution and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, all those meanes God hath offered for the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:94014:9"/>
of it. So that when God doth send deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance to the Children of Israell, they must use the meanes; and so we may truely say of Gods people here in England, as soone as they grew sensible of their bondage, when they saw that things were at the worst, they never left sighing, till it fell out, they had obtained that, which was their desire; I say Gods people here they did not cease; who would thinke that all these things should come about by the efficacy of the prayers of Gods people, he that heard the sighes of the people in Eggpt, he hath done the like in England, for never such a stocke of prayers was sent to God, as hath been within these few yeres and this hath procured a blessed answer from Heaven; and indeed this is it which still goes on with you, most noble Senators there is a great stocke of prayers going on for you; these prayers of GODS people will not faile, go forward still, they will alwaies goe along with you, and whereas formerly many mouths were stopped, many shut up, and even as dead men, the Parliament hath opened their mouthes, they begin to open the mouths of them that were dumbe, to speake for the setting forward of the word of God. It hath opened the prisons; and in deed as it was in the building of the second Temple at Ierusalem, after the Captivity of Babylon, it was carried up by the Prophesies of <hi>Haggi,</hi> and of <hi>Zachariah,</hi> so I may say, and that truly, the now reformation of the Temple, of the Church of GOD and of the deliverance of it from Bondage, and from the Babilonian Captivity, it is mounted up by the Prayers of the People of God, and by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesying of his faithfull servants, notwithstanding

            <p>But blessed be God, though the Swords hath bin ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the sides of our people, and though they carryed weapons in their hands, yet there were no <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

               </gap> be not vnder bondage, or no, and for this in briefe, that I may end with the time, let vs consider whether we were vnder bondage, and what bondage we were vnder, (if vnder any) J told you of severall kinds of Bondage, of some of them I shall not speake. Now then if I should speake of the bondage that lyes vpon your estates<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> euery one would confesse it, if it bee of the bondage of the body, this hath a speciall interest in the outward estate against oppression, or in respect of Conscience, when we would hold them out against Innovations of <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

               </gap> in the matters of humane devises, and if I should speake of the bondage we all lye vnder, in respect of sinne, but from that God will deliuer his people, and indeed this is a generall bondage that lyes vpon the whole Land<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> vpon all men in generall, and although it be in it's owne nature, the most grievous, the most miserable, and the most desperate and damnable, yet most men are not sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible of it, few consider it, they goe on in this spirituall bondage, living in sinne, and living in lust, as if they were vnder no bondage at all, when in the meane time they are the Captives of Sathan, who leades them in a string, who <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

then that of Sinne, for there are many that are delivered from the bondage of sinne, yet still lie vnder the bondage of humane ordinances in the worship of God, so that we shall doe well to consider, how wee may get deliverance out of this bondage. So that to show what is this bondage of the Conscience, and wherein it doth stand, or what are the signes of it, that Gods people lye under this bondage in this Land, J will give instance thereof in foure particulars. The first, is the bondage of Conscience <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

            <p>First, for the bondage of the Conscience vnder <hi>Liturgy,</hi> Beloued if you turne to <hi>Coloss.</hi> 2.20. you shall find that the spirit of God doth by St. <hi>Paul,</hi> blast all these seruices, at one breath, invented by men, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed of necessity vpon the Conscience in vsing those prayers which the service of God <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

            <p>Beloved, J must crave pardon, J speake the word of God, and therefore you must pardon me, if J use those termes which are fitting to expresse it.</p>
            <p>Well, now we have taken a short view of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall branches, as it were, of the linkes of the chaine, wherein we were held in bondage.</p>
            <p>Now, in a word that J may conclude, turning my selfe to the worthies of our <hi>Israel,</hi> let me desire your patience in a word for confirmation, who must doe it; what must be done for the freeing of the Gospell of God, first who, who but those whom God hath called, who but the noble house of Parliament, and those that have interest in this great businesses; they must doe it, who but they: and therefore wee must pray that God would put it into your hea<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="26" facs="tcp:94014:13"/>
that King <hi>Lucius</hi> and thereby wee may see, that at that time, the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> was in her Infancy, for even the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> did acknowledge the word of God, the Scripture, to containe a Rule for all things done in the Church of God, for Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Discipline, and what ever else in the service of God.</p>
            <p>So then beloved, we may stand upon good reason, who is this Law-giver of the Church of God, who is the Law-giver under the New Testament, is it not hee that is the Law-giver under the Old, what did Christ there, did hee not set up a forme of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and service as hee pleased, that hee might make the <hi>Oeconomie</hi> of that <hi>Mosaicall</hi> service agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to those times. He hath now abolished all those Rites of the Old Testament; This Christ did so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly, that there was not so much as the Pin of the Tabernacle left for us. So then for the patterne of Christ in the New Testament left for us, wee must goe by that which Christ hath set up in his word, and what is the summe of it, the very summe of the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of God, is that which Christ saith in the 4. <hi>Iob. The time was that you worshipped in Ierusalem, and in this Mountaine; but the time shall come that they that worship God, shall worship him in Spirit, and in Truth</hi>; Christ hath tyed the Church to no Ceremony, to shew, that all our service and worship of God, it must be in Spirit and Truth, it must not be in sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes and types, in imitation of the Jewes in their Leviticall services, but it must be in spirit and truth: But here some will say, and J remember that one hath in a written Booke called the Relation of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference,

The Church of God is the spouse of Christ, the spouse of Christ must not put on a <hi>Babilonish</hi> gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, lest she be taken for a whore, it is a shame for a spouse, to be in a whores garment; she must be ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by her husband; and therefore we must not goe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to paint the service of God with our colours, nor with the colour of our devotion; y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fairest face by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture if painted, the beauty will be quickly eaten out, the painting, decking, adorning, &amp; colouring y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion of the service of God, with mans devises; it disfigures the faire, and beautifull face of Gods ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and makes it seeme like a hag in the eyes of God, and indeed there is nothing did destroy religion more then when men began to set up service of God, of their owne devising; Thus did the Popes from time to time from age to age, bring in that masse of Superstition and Idolatrous service; So that it is rather the service of man, or rather the service of the divell, now you must know beloved, that Jesus Christ, thtt is our Lawgiver, that is our Prophet, he knew what was to be done in matters of worship, who is the onely

King over our Consciences<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as well as our high Priest to sacrifice for us, and to make attonement for us, we must hearken unto him, for he hath done all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly, he harh beene as exact a Lawgiver in the new Testament as in the old, will you aske then what ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice he hath left, he hath taught us to pray in the Church of God, to preach the word of God, he hath taught us to expound the Scripture to old men and yong, and for to spend their time in the Church of God, he taught Ministers, not onely to Preach, but also to pray; we must give our selves to prayer, and the word, that is prayer, and Preaching.</p>

Surely if there be a tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the booke of <hi>Common Prayer</hi> which is a weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to the people, dulling their Spirits, wearying the Minister, making him unable to goe on in his Preaching, exhausting of their Spirits, &amp;c. yet bind it not upon those Ministers, that are able to pray, and able to Preach.</p>
            <p>To conclude all in one word, with this earnest de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire and Petition unto you, the worthies of our Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, that for the better setting up of the Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Jesus Christ, and the true worship of God, you would seperate the uncleane from the cleane, by casting out those things that are offensive; That you would cleanse Churches of all their abhominations, not onely of what hath been set up of late, but also of former times; As all Images, and Crucifixes: and also Organs, let them be silent, brought in by <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ</hi> in imitation of the <hi>Jewish</hi> Organs, shall Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans be blowing in the Te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple, when the Spirit should be taken up in the service of God; give mee leave to use my owne President when I was in prison, I found more comfort, in singing one Psalme with my single voice, then ever I did in all those Psalmes upon my Jnstrument formerly: J say the Spirit of God had the heart of it; which is taken away by mingling it with any Instrument: and certainly Christ left no Musick unto the word of God, onely that of the heart, and to sing Psalmes? So <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> in the prison, they sung a Psalme which brake open the Prison doores. So our Saviour himselfe left the same exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in singing of Psalmes; wherein the Spirit of man is taken up, and not distracted by the sences of

And beloved J beseech you give me leave to exhort you, that there may be no Monuments of Superstition, and Jdolatry, that are set up in our times, that have bin the objects of Jdolatry, that is all crosses in high-wayes, and I beseech you that for an example you would begin with the golden Jdoll in <hi>Cheap-side,</hi> that hath been an occasion for many Papists to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit spirituall Fornication; J remember in a former Parliament, there was a <hi>Committee</hi> sent to view the Crosse, with a purpose to take it down, I beseech you doe the like, and cast downe all those abhominations, that there may be nothing left as an abhomination to the Land in the Lords sight: you are the worthies, and you must doe it.</p>
            <p>J draw to an end, and desire to put you in mind, though J know you are not forgetfull of that noble <hi>Protestation,</hi> that you have made for your selves, the <hi>Protestation</hi> is against all Popery, and Popish Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations, Popish Jnnovations, what are they, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly those that have crept in of later times, by the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption of busie-bodies; but those that have bin in the Church of God, ever since the Apostles, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever any man hath set up in the Church of GOD since the Apostles, that are in the sight of God, Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous, and against y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Scripture; that is Popish Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations.
