         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

First that they might take none blind-fold, they opened me with a generall confession of all my sinnes; then closed vp all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine by the Sacrament, and after this least there might be any relique of the world left vpon me, they made mee disinvest my selfe of such pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane garments I had, and the superfluities of haire, but one they kept, the other they threwe away; then was I reinuested with a Doublet of white Canuas, Breeches and stockings that had not troubled the Weauer with ouer much paines, Cassocke &amp; stockings of the same blacke and graue, the band precise and short, with a hat that might almost shaddow all, and shooes cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respondent.

Consultors approue of, which 12. Consultors are ordinarily termed his white boyes. The pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiledge of this sodality is that they haue graces, rosaries, and beades, Indulgences, Meddals and hallowed graines from his holinesse. In vertue whereof as the Prefect tels them being once ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted into the same society, they may obtaine pardon of all their sinnes past, and at the houre of their death, saying or but thinking on the name of Iesus, <hi>Mary, Ioseph,</hi> they are actually pardoned and freed from the paines of Purgato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, which otherwise had they not beene of this society they should haue endured.</p>
               <p>With one of the aforesaid graines saying one

                  <hi>Aue Marie</hi> they may by the vertue of each deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer a soule from Purgatory. Besides on the day any that are in this sodality establisht, their sins are remitted, swearing sidelity, and stiling them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues the Virgins slaues: On this manner each Sunday betwixt seuen and eight they spend their time and they all go to Masse, and receiue the Communion, thence to breakefast, after to the Study, whereas before they busie themselues in reading diuine stories till dinner; anon after dinner to their Church where they sing Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers and Letanies to our Lady for <hi>Englands</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersion, hauing written on their Church and Colledge doores in great golden letters, <hi>Iesu, Iesu, converte Angliam, fiat fiat.</hi> These are onely the outsides of their profession: But now will I rippe vp the very bowels of these treacherous glosing Fathers: First those schollers who are Nobly descended and of rich parentage, they striue to allure by their honied words, and flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring imbracings, indowing them with pictures, beads, meddals, Agnus dei, which they haue from <hi>Rome:</hi> Also that their baites may take ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, they licence them to participate of all those wines and juncates prouided for their owne pallates, and if white boyes of a come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly feature they bestow on them (though ill de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruing) the preheminence of the schooles. And with these is the Prefect of musicke most recre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated, reading to them <hi>Ouid, Hor.

Againe, a second baite is laid for those more graue then the former; for instance, a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of <hi>Yorkeshire</hi> by name M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Henry Fairefax,</hi> sonne to S<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Thomas Fairefax,</hi> who not yeelding to their inchanting allurements, one night being a sleepe in his bed, two Iesuites clad in gorgeous white as they had beene Angels, approaching his<note place="margin">This they did in imitation of the two An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels that whipt <hi>S.Ierome.</hi>

<pb n="21" facs="tcp:19982:14"/>
after Father <hi>Thunder</hi> blushed not to acquaint this Gentleman with the truth of it, and that it was onely done for his good, tract of time ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing now sufficiently digested his misery, and being by this time inur'd in their Orders, that howsoeuer (he so well approued of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanours) bee resolued to continue his abode with them.</p>
               <p>The second example is that Father <hi>Francis Wallis</hi> alias <hi>Clearke,</hi> now Minister of the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge desired to allure to their Order, one M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>William Abinton</hi> a Student in their house, onely sonne to M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Iohn Abinton,</hi> in whose house the Traytor <hi>Garnet</hi> was apprehended for two rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons: First because hee was ingenious and well learned: secondly, because his Father had lost the greatest part of his meanes in behalfe of the aforesaid apprehension, the Iesuites also hauing made largesses of promises to requite the said losse in ample manner, could no otherwise doe for him but so. The course <hi>Wallis</hi> tooke was this, one morning seeing him passe by his win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow went after him, calling him by his name, and saying vnto him that a little before hee had<note place="margin">This Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man liues now in <hi>England</hi> at hi<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="22" facs="tcp:19982:15"/>
the space of a moneth to take farewell of his friends in <hi>England,</hi> which conditionally was granted, with a promise of a speedy returne: but he no sooner had arriued his owne Country shores, but he vtterly disclaimed their superstiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous reueales.</p>
               <p>The third example is M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Herbert Crafts,</hi> some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times of the Vniuersity of <hi>Oxford,</hi> sonne to Sir <hi>Herbert Crafts,</hi> who trauailing to S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Omers</hi> to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sit his Father who liued in the Towne, was by him and Father <hi>Iohn Flood,</hi> brought to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane</hi> obedience, and though his Father was a good Catholike, yet he counselled him neuer to turne Iesuite. Yet for all that, they found out a way to draw him vnto them, which was a sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle and a craftie one indeed, viz. to entice him to<note place="margin">See the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring discoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. pag. 12.</note> take the spirituall exercise which he refused not being a matter of honour amongst the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes to enter into; the order they obserue in ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of it is this: in 15 dayes space hee is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed a chamber solitary, and sequestered from the rest, for this said space hee is to speake with none saue his ghostly Father, who directs him in the distribution of each day, one houre is to examine his conscience of what sinnes hee hath committed in times past, another time to say his prayers, and office of the Virgin <hi>Mary;</hi> another for the hearing of Masse, and saying of his Rosarie, but the principall to which the ghostly Father doth apply himselfe, is to giue that person certaine meditations made by <hi>Ignatius Loyola</hi> which are as follow. First, that
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:19982:15"/>
meditation of the creation of the world: se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,<note place="margin">1</note> the creation of mankinde, and how much<note place="margin">2</note> man is obliged and bound vnto God for his cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation:<note place="margin">2</note> thirdly, what a man ought to do for those apparent benefits which we receiue from his li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berall hands: fourthly, that there is no way more<note place="margin">4</note> certaine vnto saluation, then that of a Monasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call and solitary life: fiftly, the explanation of<note place="margin">5</note> this question, what this solitary or Monasticall life is, which they answer, that it is to liue in a Monastery or Desart: sixtly, that all religious<note place="margin">6</note> Orders at their first course and originall were holy, and sacred institutions, but by the corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of time they haue lost their ancient purity: seuenthly, what a man is to doe for the surety of<note place="margin">7</note> his saluation, seeing that (as it is their abhomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable maxime, with a kinde of a negatiue limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation) that any wandring from their Collegiate society, (which they terme their Paradice) into the world, can hardly attaine to the hope of sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation:<note place="margin">8</note> eightly, that that man which desireth the saluation of his owne soule, must renounce all the doctrine of the reformed Churches, and cleaue onely to their holy society; and that for two reasons: the first, that as all Orders at their<note place="margin">1</note> first beginnings did obserue their injunctions punctually, but through their corruption and dissention for priority lost that efficacy which they had at their Foundation; so they suppose their Iesuiticall society being newly instituted, hath not had the time to be corrupted (their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther societies of the Dominicans and Francis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:19982:16"/>

                     </gap>. ibid. p. 25.</note> Secondly, that considering that their Grand <hi>Ignatian</hi> Saint being highly preferred to the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighties fauour by the holy Ghost, and euen pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralelling him with our Sauiour in that power of casting out Diuels, (if not rather procuring offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories by this fained power) thought that if other<note place="margin">Idem docuit Franciscus vid. testimonium Gregorij 9. in fine testamenti Francisci.</note> Orders had beene more strict then theirs, hee had neuer founded his or this society.</p>
               <p>And furthermore, they pretend that S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Ignatius</hi> receiued by diuine reuelation, that none of his Order should euer bee damned for 200 yeeres terme, and this they beleeue as an Article of their Creed. In conclusion of all, they exhibit vnto him the meditation of death, and contemplation of the paines of hell, so by these meanes they wonne the Gentleman to their Order against the will of his Father. In this very exercise I my selfe was initiated for some 15 dayes space, but it was Gods pleasure to giue mee more vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding then to bee led away with the rest. Besides these they haue yet farther plots to bring their young Students in beliefe that they are well seene in Chyromancy, and can tell them their fortunes, and what are these thinke you? either they must be Iesuites, or looke for a disastrous end. Of these fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sifying trickes I my selfe was an eye witnesse. Now let mee descend to their most barbarous proceedings, which are indeed numberlesse, but for auoyding prolixity, I will recount here a few: Some few yeeres since, there was one M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Edward Hastings</hi> at <hi>Hurlston,</hi> an ingenious young Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:19982:16"/>
whom when they could not draw vnto them by the meanes aforesaid, they exercised on him such Tyrannicall discipline, that the least fault he did they Stoically interpreted to bee e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall to the greatest, and punisht him according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; this most cruell handling of him being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable, he writ to his friends and informed them thereof, most earnestly intreating them to send for him. *But their letters were intercepted<note place="margin">There is no way to go out of this Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, or to write or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue any let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, saue with consent of the Rector, for they are kept as in prison vnder locke and key.</note> by the Rectors hands, and answered by him a gaine, that he was wilde and head strong, and that it would proue his vtter ruine if euer hee came into <hi>England,</hi> which he perceiuing, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solued with himselfe to leape ouer the Colledge wall, but being taken in the instant, Father <hi>Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> clapt his buttocks till hee left him halfe dead, to make him an example, then sent him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way with foure shillings in his purse to conduct him for <hi>England:</hi> so likewise they vsed * Sir<note place="margin">This Sir <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Browne</hi> died at S. <hi>Omers.</hi>

<pb n="26" facs="tcp:19982:17"/>
for their Society, in protecting in his Chamber that Iesuite Father <hi>Gerat,</hi> a complotter of the Gunpowder Treason, and then interpreter to the <hi>Spanish</hi> Embassador in <hi>England,</hi> in consideration whereof, the Prouinciall <hi>Blunt</hi> gaue him a letter of fauour to <hi>Gondamor</hi> the then Embassador in <hi>England,</hi> where the letter was writ in this tenure, I intreate your Excellency to doe for this strag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling sheepe who hath beene bred with vs, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusing to take any more religious functions hath forsaken our Colledge; which Count <hi>Gondamor</hi> hauing read, made little account of the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, but notwithstanding reflecting vpon his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers deserts, gaue him house roome and dyet, and afterwards perceiuing his dexterity of wit, made choise of him for his Secretaty, and now since the death of his Master, he is retainer to his Catholike Maiestie. These past, in the yeere 1622. Father <hi>Baldwin</hi> was elected Rector of the Colledge of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Omers,</hi> who had lately suffered imprisonment in the Tower of <hi>London</hi> for seuen yeeres space, for suspition of high Treason, was in the yeere 1619. by <hi>Gondamors</hi> intercession set free: this man insisting on the same steps with his predecessors, became the first <hi>English</hi> Rector of that Colledge, and the second yeere after, there was sent to this Colledge, a young Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman <hi>Estenelaus Browne</hi> by name, sonne and heire to M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Anthony Browne,</hi> brother to the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count <hi>Mountague:</hi> this Gentleman after two yeeres abode there, wearied by their tyranny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call discipline, and desirous to get his necke

               <p>Now let vs come to the Iesuites themselues what loue and vnity they mutually entertaine amongst them, and to their three seuerall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessions: the first and chiefe of them are meere Machiauillians, who doe nothing but imploy themselues in matters of State, and insinuate themselues into the secrets of great ones, and giuing true intelligence to none, saue to the Pope and his Catholike Maiesty, whose sworne vassals they are; these obseruing no Collegiate discipline are dispenced withall by his Holines, as if they did God greater seruice in thus im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploying themselues, then following Collegiate courses.

               <p>At midnight, two <hi>Moores</hi> come downe vnto vs, &amp; secretly selecting two of the youngest and fairest amongst vs, abused their bodies with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>satiable lust, and on the next morning they strip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping themselue starke naked, and powring out

water one vpon the others head, supposed by this washing they were cleansed from their new acted sinne.</p>
               <p>Another night the <hi>Moores</hi> making merry vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the decks, and halfe drunke with their drinke which they call <hi>Opium,</hi> our Marriners of <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burge,</hi> and some <hi>Portugall</hi> Captiues which were with vs perceiuing such oportunity, we encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged each other to rise vp against them, their weapons being below with vs, and one of the <hi>Portugals</hi> hands vntyed; whereupon we agreed, and this <hi>Portugall</hi> beginning to vntie the rest, was apprehended in the Act by the Captaine of the Gally, who comming downe in a fury, said that he knew what wee intended, and that hee could discouer in his sleepe, more treachery then wee could inuent being awake<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And well might he do so hauing the helpe of their Priest with him who was a witch (as most of them are) and then putting the plotters to death, he fette<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vs more strongly with irons.</p>

crammed like Capons, that we might grow fat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and better for sale, and being brought to the market, were shared amongst them and sold.</p>
               <p>And thus we were diuided to seuerall masters, taking farewell one of another with teares in our eyes, neuer thinking to meete any more: the price which was giuen for each of vs was 25. pound more or lesse, our masters being <hi>Moris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coes,</hi> which dwelt at the Castle.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Hamburges</hi> likewise were sold in like manner, but in this respect were in farre worse estate, because they were sold to <hi>Moores</hi> in that Countrey, &amp; therefore had lesse hopes of future redemption: But amongst the rest of our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany I deemed my selfe the happiest, because I fell to the Captaine of the shippe, whose name was <hi>Alligallan</hi> a <hi>Morisco,</hi> who had beene banished with a 100000. more from <hi>Spaine,</hi> by <hi>Philip</hi> the third, vpon suspition of treason.

               <p>The victuals he gaue me were Bereugenaes,

Cabbage, and Goats flesh; As for my lodging it<note place="margin">This Bereuge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naes is like our Turnips.</note> was in a dungeon in the market place, where they vse commonly to lodge their slaues, who repaire there euery night about eight of the clocke, their masters manicling their hands be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore for feare they should make an insurrection, the number of them being about 800. being <hi>Spaniards, Frenchmen, English, Italians, Portugals,</hi> and <hi>Flemmish,</hi> our beds were nothing but rotten straw laid on the ground, and our couerlets pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of old sailes full of millions of lice and fleas, so that we could take no rest, being constrained to put backe to backe and rub out the paine; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout fiue of the clocke in the morning the doore being opened we repaired to our masters houses, and so to our wonted worke.</p>
               <p>And it chanced on a time that I hauing not performed my ordinary taske, was beaten by my master so cruelly, that for a long time after I lost the vse of my left arme, which he percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing said, at most it was but the losse of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian dogge. Another time going to fetch water from the Fountaine, I chanced to make water a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Church wall, which a <hi>Moore</hi> seeing, presently made toward me, and asked whether it was the custome of my Countrey to doe so or no, if it was, it was not the custome of theirs, and thereupon beat mee till hee left mee halfe dead. A while after this, my Master perceiuing me to bee sicke and feeble, and not able to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme any seruice, gaue me leaue to see a <hi>French</hi> Merchant, by name <hi>Iehan de la Goretta,</hi> to see if I
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:19982:25"/>
could perswade him to redeeme me; this Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant traded from thence to <hi>Siuill,</hi> and <hi>Cales,</hi> and vsed to traffique for slaues and other commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, to whom when I had opened my case, hee promised to do for me what possibly hee could, and hauing taken my name in writing, he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently told me he knew one of my name, whom (as it fell out) was my Vnckle, who was then the <hi>English</hi> Consull for the Merchants at S. <hi>Lucas,</hi> and thereupon hauing examined mee, and fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding me to tell the truth, offered to my master 50. crownes for my ransome, but my master vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly refused it, then the Merchant rose higher, and gaue him the summe of sixscore crownes and vpwards, and so I was ransomed and set at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty.</p>
               <p>Now I began (hauing a <hi>Moore</hi> in my compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny for my conductor) to enquire after my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions, whom I found in the Castle, and in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall priuate houses, whom they scarce euer suffered to come abroad, especially the fairest and youngest, whose bodies they abused with their Sodomy. I hauing with much difficulty obtained to see them, tooke my leaue of them and went to the Merchant, acquainting him how I had beene with my companions, and intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting if hee could possibly hee would ransome them, who made great demurre for the present, not knowing them, and besides they being so many in number, that their ransome would a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount to a farre greater summe of money then he could well disburse, whereupon I perswaded
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:19982:25"/>
him that it would bee an exceeding charitable deed, and no lesse auailable vnto him, their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and friends being men of great fashion in <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So then at last the Merchant partly resolued to redeeme them, went to visit them, but most of their masters would not part with them vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any termes, which the Merchant perceiuing, betooke himselfe to the Gouernor of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle who was his very great friend, and presen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting him with a diamond ring of 600. crownes price, procuring the Gouernor to buy them for himselfe, who did it, and gaue for them, some 30. pound, some 40. pound a peece.</p>
               <p>Which done, hee deliuered them vp to the Merchant, which the <hi>Moores</hi> their said masters vnderstanding, came in great rage and tooke them out of the Merchants house where wee were altogether expecting to be imbarked the next winde for <hi>Spaine,</hi> but one of their masters saying I was the occasion they were like to loose their slaues, drew his Cemiter vpon me to kill me, but I betooke my selfe to my heeles, and tooke sanctuary in the Gouernors house, whom when I had informed how the case stood, came out with his guard and protected me, and tooke my companions from their masters againe, and put vs all in a house neere his owne, with a guard of 12 musketiers to defend vs till such time as the Merchants shippe was ready for <hi>Spaine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hereupon the <hi>Moores</hi> their masters were fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther inraged, and hauing complotted together,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:19982:26"/>
said they would haue them to be gelded, and to be sent for Eunuches as a present to the King of <hi>Marruecos</hi> to attend vpon his 300. wiues, so they went to the Gouernor and declared this their minde vnto him, the Gouernor was much per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed, not daring to deny any thing which was for his King.</p>
               <p>Whereupon the Gouernor not knowing any other way to preuaile, intreated them that they would not do so, and that vpon a greater occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on they should command him greater matters, and so with perswasions and good words he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained his will, and we being freed from all dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and the Merchant ready to depart for <hi>Spaine,</hi> one of the aforesaid <hi>Moores</hi> presented him with a poysoned tart, to the end he dying there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, they might recouer all their slaues. But as it pleased God this poyson wrought not with him for a day and a halfe, for after dinner hee tooke his leaue of the Gouernor being as yet found, and the Gouernor brought him on ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board, taking vs 12. along with him, where de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting, we all gaue him most humble and hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty thankes, as the sole instrument of our most happy deliuery.

the Port, the morning tyde being come wee car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed our Merchant on shoare, and I being about to lay him on a bed, he presently expired in mine armes, not making any will or disposing of his goods: Next day he was buried with all honour the Gouernour of the Towne and Souldiers could exhibit, we 12. carrying torches before his corps to the Church, sang the <hi>requiem</hi> and dirges of the dead, and the Priest celebrated masse for his soule.</p>
               <p>Which Ceremonies ended wee returned to our ships, and being ready to depart with the next morning tyde, there drew towards <hi>Mammo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra,</hi> the <hi>Moore</hi> whom they call the Saint of <hi>Salley,</hi> with 30000. other <hi>Alarabes,</hi> and assaulted it with such fury and shouting, as if heauen and earth were come together, then making their onset were valiantly repulsed, the towne being assisted with 150 Marriners, and Passengers out of our shippe and pinnaces, but especially by two <hi>French</hi> Gunners who neuer let fly in vaine, the <hi>Spanish</hi> Gunners missing for the most part.</p>
               <p>Thus a great part of the <hi>Moores</hi> being slaine, the rest fled with their S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. backe againe to <hi>Salley.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And we two dayes after departing the towne, continued our course for <hi>Cales,</hi> but drawing neere the City of <hi>Alarache,</hi> we were chased by three men of warre of <hi>Argier,</hi> so that wee were forced to take shelter vnder the Castle of <hi>Alara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che,</hi> where I and another of my companions got on shoare, vnwilling to venture any further in the ship, but finding there a lighter boate of the Gouernors ready for <hi>Cales,</hi> wee embarkt our
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:19982:27"/>
selues therein, being accompanied with one Captaine and a Dominican Fryer, and when we were neere <hi>Cales</hi> the Fryer began to tell the Captaine of the best Curtesans in the towne, but in the midst of his story he perceiued a <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kish</hi> Barke making towards vs, which broke off his discourse, and droue him to mumble ouer his mouldy beades, and say his Breuiary, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to the Virgin <hi>Mary.</hi> But hauing gotten on the <hi>Spanish</hi> shoare, told what was behinde of his former discourse.</p>
               <p>Here I departing with my other companion, went to S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Lucas</hi> which was three leagues off to my Vnckles house, where I was receiued and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained with no little joy; where also ten daies after, the rest of our company arriued, with whom being furnished for my journey accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied them to their Colledge in <hi>Siuill,</hi> whence taking my leaue I left them, being not willing to tast any more of their discipline, and wishing them withall to take order to satisfie the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants daughter, hauing already done it for me.</p>
               <p>The Rector made answer for them to me, that he would take that to his charge.</p>
               <p>And so I went to the Court of <hi>Madrid</hi> to visit my Parents and friends who knew not what was become of me, where being entertained with no small joy, I opened to my Father the misery I had suffered and acquainted him with the Iesu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ites practises at S. <hi>Omers,</hi> and the reasons where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I left them; this my Father hearing, grew into dislike with the Iesuites, but especially when he vnderstood that the Rector of the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:19982:27"/>
at <hi>Siuill</hi> had cheated the Merchants daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter whose father lost his life in ransoming their schollers, which cheat was contriued on this manner. The Iesuites of <hi>Siuill</hi> hauing beene in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed that the Merchant disbursed not ready money for their ransome, but was to pay it at his returne, now (he not returning) they affirmed that they thought in conscience they were out of debt for the matter, neuer considering that the Merchant had left his warehouse fraught with the value of 10000. crownes behind, which their deceit his daughter now seeing sued them in the law, but the Iesuites so possessed the Iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges that they ouerthrew her in the cause, so that now she was left destitute of Father and goods, the foresaid <hi>Moores</hi> &amp; Iesuites being trebly paid.</p>
               <p>Now the Iesuites wrote to <hi>England</hi> to their friends for their ransomes, which being speedily sent, they enjoyed themselues.</p>
               <p>Moreouer they made a Tragicall-Comedy of our voyage, whereby they got much money and honour, whereupon all people admired Gods prouidence, and our deliuery out of such mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest dangers, which the Iesuites ascribed only to their protector S. <hi>Ignatius</hi> we being their schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, and thereupon they collected no small summes of money, which they pretended was to pay for our ransoming.<note place="margin">All are there liuing, s<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>This sixt Chapter containes diuerse<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> remarkable things touching the Iesuites and Monkes, and also the death of his Father in <hi>Madrid,</hi> where after his voyage hee liued two yeeres, vntill his Catholike Maiesty nominated him his Captaine for <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.</hi>

               </argument>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the yeere 1623. I arriued at <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drid</hi> as aforesaid, where I resided with my Parents liuing in peace and tranquillity, vntill such times as there came to <hi>Madrid,</hi> that magnanimious and vertuous Prince <hi>Charles</hi> Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> now King of great <hi>Britaine,</hi> whose voyage procured the wonder of the world, the like being neuer heard or read of; but leauing the description thereof to more skilfull pennes then mine owne, I returne to my intended subiect. First then the Iesuites perceiuing what finall accounts I made of returning vnto them, gaue me ouer for a cast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>away, and sought by all meanes they could to disgrace me to my parents and friends, but I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing afore acquainted with their dealings, kept me out of their clutches. Now the Earle of <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lile</hi> the Lord <hi>Hayes</hi> by name, arriued at <hi>Madrid,</hi> tooke me from my Father and made me his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreter for the time of his abode in <hi>Spaine,</hi> and after his departure I past my time to and fro in diuerse <hi>English</hi> Gentlemens company, still ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:19982:28"/>
the conclusion of the match betweene <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Spaine,</hi> and hoping thereby to bee admitted into the seruice of <hi>Donna Maria</hi> the Infanta whom my Father had tutoured in the <hi>English</hi> tongue, and had also the promise of all courtesies shee could possibly do him, and thus passing my time, I fell into acquaintance with M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Francis Browne</hi> sonne &amp; heire to the Vicount <hi>Mountague,</hi> and M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Henry Barty,</hi> the now Lord of <hi>Lindseys</hi> brother, one M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Anthony Inglefield</hi> the foresaid M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Brownes</hi> cosen germane and Earle of <hi>Bristols</hi> Page. This M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Browne</hi> had a Benedictine Monke to his Tutor whose name was Fryer <hi>Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net,</hi> alias <hi>Smith,</hi> who through the aduice of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Benedictine Monke one Father <hi>Boniface,</hi> tooke him out of the Earle of <hi>Bristols</hi> house, and put him to a Priests house in <hi>Madrid</hi> to bee tutour'd and brought vp in learning, telling him that it was very absurd that such a Gentlemans sonne as he was should be Page, and that especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in <hi>Spaine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But their intent was to make him one of their owne order, and so get his meanes away from him, for they enioyned the Priest to looke to him very narrowly, and not suffer him to go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, without either going himself, or else sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding a faithfull companion along with him, and that vpon Sundayes and Holidayes hee should bring him along with him to his cosens house to dinner, where I meeting afterwards with him, and growing intimate with him and his cosen, they complained to mee what seuerity the
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:19982:29"/>
Monks exercised vpon them, but especially vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Inglefield,</hi> inticing him daily to take their habit vpon him, saying, that there was not such an order to be found in the whole world besides, and that he should bee admitted into the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of any Duke or Prince, and moreouer rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koning vp how many Popes had beene of their Order and the like. As for M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>, <hi>Browne</hi> they kept him in so close, that he rather liued the life of a Monke then a Courtier, for they made him eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day to meditate vpon death, and the danger of liuing in the world, thinking thereby to draw him to their Order, at least to be well affected thereunto. Likewise they made him say the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of our Lady, and their grand Priests breuia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and so at length they got such a hand ouer him, that they made him oft times go on foote whilst they rode about juncketting in his coach; but now leauing the Monkes awhile, let vs come to the Iesuites and <hi>Austen</hi> Fryers.</p>
               <p>First how the Iesuites went about to seduce to them one M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Henry Challoner,</hi> sonne to Sir <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Challoner,</hi> late Tutor to Prince <hi>Henry:</hi> this young Gentleman not contenting himselfe with the bare knowledge of Arts, and liberall scien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces at home, but desiring likewise to bee more really and experimentally informed by visiting forreigne parts, imbarkt himselfe at <hi>Douer</hi> for S. <hi>Lucas</hi> in <hi>Spaine<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> where being arriued tooke his way by <hi>Siuill</hi> to <hi>Madrid,</hi> and at <hi>Siuill</hi> he went to the Colledge of <hi>English</hi> Iesuites to see the discipline and gouernment thereof, and the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suites
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:19982:29"/>
seeing him to bee but tender of yeeres, made full account to draw him to their Orders by their flattering words and inticements, tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling him as yet he was in a great errour, that it were his best course to admit of the <hi>Romane</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick faith without which there is no saluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; but he demeaned himselfe so discreetly that they could not possible worke him ouer with all their enticements. Hereupon seeing they could not preuaile by their arguments and inticements the kept him in their Colledge perforce, where considering in what straite he now was, contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the meanes of his liberty after this manner: he told them that hee had a brother a neere re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainer to his Highnesse of <hi>Wales,</hi> who had sent for him to preferre him to his seruice, which the Iesuites hearing dismised him speedily, for feare they should incurre some great displeasure. And so taking his leaue he tooke his journey for <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drid,</hi> where by the way hee met with a certaine <hi>Austin</hi> Fryer, which was then trauailing for <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drid,</hi> whose company hee enioyed to the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said <hi>Madrid,</hi> but on the way the Fryer well ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruing the comelynesse and ingenious lookes grew forthwith inamoured with him, insomuch that he desired to be his bed fellow, and in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition thereof he promised him a nights lodging with his sister, who for her beauty was then pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralel'd but by very few in all <hi>Spaine,</hi> but this young Genrleman not giuing way to his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quests, as exceeding the bounds of reason and modesty, left the Fryer much perplexed in his
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:19982:30"/>
vnnaturall desires; when they came to <hi>Madrid,</hi> the Fryer went to his Couent, and this young Gentleman to the Court, where hee was enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by his Highnesse, who gaue charge to his Secretary that he should want for nothing, tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling him that his Father had beene a second Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to his brother whose god-sonne hee was; thus passing his time at the Court vnder the Princes protection and care, was here also as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore at the <hi>Siuill</hi> Colledge assaulted by one Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Foster,</hi> but he put him off as the rest. A little after he returning into <hi>England</hi> with his High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, now my Father continued in his tutorship of the Infant vntill he fell sicke and dyed, <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uember</hi> the last, 1623. the chiefe occasion of his death being this: the Iesuites and their depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants seeing that he consulted not with them as in times past, for finding himselfe wonderfully mistaken in them and their religion, said it was high time for him to looke to his owne soule, and yet he doubted not if it pleased God but hee would saue one. Whereupon the Iesuites en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deauoring by all possible meanes to exauthorize him vnder hand, informing the Infanta that his disease the cough of the lungs might proue in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectious to her person; vpon this shee sent her Physitians to visit him, and they finding it other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, she continued him in her seruice.</p>
               <p>But a little after hee being aduertised by his friends of the Iesuites plots and information a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him, and seeing also the same himselfe, went home, and after the eight dayes space with
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:19982:30"/>
sickenesse and discontent hee dyed, leauing his place to one Father <hi>Boniface,</hi> in whose Church he was buried, his body being accompanied by the Earle <hi>Gondamor</hi> and other Nobles of the Court, and all the seruants of the Infanta, with many other <hi>English</hi> Gentlemen, as M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Barty,</hi> M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Browne,</hi> S<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Edward Bainham,</hi> M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Inglefield</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; the dirges and <hi>requiems</hi> and other ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies ended, my brother and I went to kisse the Infantas and <hi>Don Oliuares</hi> his hands, who most graciously receiued vs, and procured vs our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers pension.</p>
               <p>This past, I liued at <hi>Madrid</hi> at my mothers house 7 or 8 monthes, in which I continued my former friendship with M <hi>Browne,</hi> and M. <hi>Ingle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field,</hi> but especially with M. <hi>Inglefield,</hi> who told me againe how vehemently hee was vrged and importun'd to turne Monke, whereupon I di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded him from it, which Father <hi>Boniface</hi> smel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling out, gaue order to his tutor to refraine my company, which M. <hi>Inglefield</hi> took so grieuously, that on the sunday following when his tutor was saying Masse at the high altar, got from him, and came to me where I entertained him with all respect and courtesie. But Father <hi>Boniface</hi> vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing where hee was, came to him, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded him to returne to his tutor, but seeing he could not preuaile by perswasions, thought to do it by threates; but all in vaine, for the young Gentleman was resolued rather to dye then to turne Monke, which Father <hi>Boniface</hi> seeing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to his Couent as wise as he came.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="54" facs="tcp:19982:31"/>A little while after, he counselled M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Bennet</hi> the aforesaid M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Brownes</hi> tutor, to conuey him to <hi>Rome,</hi> which he did, and intreated S<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Griffin Markam,</hi> and S<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>William Stanley</hi> who then liued at the Court, and with whom I daily kept com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, to perswade me to follow the warres, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing thereby in my absence to regaine Master <hi>Inglefield</hi> with their perswasions: I presently gaue eare, and hauing got audience of his Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty, I intreated him for a commission and patent for a land company in <hi>Flanders,</hi> which his Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty forthwith granted me, and withall gaue mee 200 crownes for my <hi>viaticum:</hi> so taking leaue of my mother and friends, I tooke my journey for <hi>Flanders,</hi> but in the meane space, M. <hi>Inglefield</hi> receiued a letter from his Father, in which hee enioyned him to returne to the Vniuersity of <hi>Doway</hi> in the Prouince of <hi>Artoais,</hi> where his yonger brother was a Student, which foresaid Vniuersity was but foure leagues out of my way, and so we resolued to trauaile together, and a day before we departed, Father <hi>Francis Fosser</hi> came to visit vs, and inuited vs to accompany him the next day to <hi>Vallidolid,</hi> it being but two leagues out of the way to <hi>Flanders,</hi> at whose re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest M. <hi>Inglefield</hi> and my selfe resolued to goe with him, but especially for the great desire, wee had to see the <hi>English</hi> Colledge there; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the next day wee departed to <hi>Vallidolid,</hi> where after three dayes journey we arriued, and were inuited forthwith after our arriuals by the Rector and other Fathers of the Colledge to

lodge with them, whose request we accepted of, staying with them that night at supper, and bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time being come, they lodged M. <hi>Inglefield</hi> at one end of the Colledge and my selfe at the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, telling vs it was not a custome among them for two to lye together, whereupon I betooke my selfe to my rest, and hee to his: And I being in bed, the Sub-Rector and two of his schollers went to his Chamber, and after some conference had with him, they brought him certaine junc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets &amp; sweete meates with the best wine in the towne, telling him that if hee would be pleased to stay with them in their Colledge, he should haue all the respect and honour which a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of his quality may challenge.

which gaue him occasion to strike him ouer the face, whereupon the <hi>Frenchmen</hi> which were in company assaulted vs, &amp; had it not been for a <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheleer</hi> we had been slaine, who related vnto him that he was misinformed by Brother <hi>Hill,</hi> which they considering, dry<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>basted brother <hi>Hill</hi> and left vs. Afterwards comming to <hi>Orleance, Hill</hi> complained to the Iesuites in the <hi>French</hi> Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the seeming abuse offered vnto him, vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which they pretending to bee Christs fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers, perswaded him that if he tooke a blow on the right eare, hee should turne the left also, where seeing himselfe so slighted in his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint, railed extreamely against them, not dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming them worthy to be couered with the robs of their disorderly Orders, and thinking them to be a disgrace to all others of that society. From thence continuing our iourney till wee came to <hi>Paris,</hi> calling him there to an account of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney which wee deliuered vnto him being our purse-bearer, found his reckoning short by 7. pound, which he pretending to haue lost, gaue vs reason to discard him; wee trauailing by our selues from <hi>Paris</hi> to <hi>Doway,</hi> at which place lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Inglefield</hi> with his brother, and Doctor<note place="margin">Which dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course began by reason of their intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate drinking of Muscadine, which was the incendiary of some quarrels the day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</note> 
                  <hi>Kellison</hi> President of the <hi>English</hi> Colledge, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solued from thence to <hi>Brussels,</hi> and so to <hi>Bredah,</hi> but being inuited by M. <hi>Francis Fowler</hi> the night before I departed to the Caterers house, I found at supper, the L. <hi>S.</hi> sonne, M. <hi>P. S.</hi> and M. <hi>T. A.</hi> and M. <hi>W P.</hi> where supper ended, M. <hi>P.</hi> floting in his cups, began a* discourse concerning the casual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:19982:33"/>
we are subiect vnto in this world, preferring the Order of a Franciscan before others. To who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I answered that on condition hee would turne Fryer, I would turne Monke, I being seconded by M. <hi>S.</hi> and M. <hi>Fowler,</hi> which their jest at last tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to earnest, whereupon M. <hi>P.</hi> disrobing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe of all his rich apparrell, gaue them to his Hoste <hi>Edmunds,</hi> who being potshotten and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing the Moone to shine bright through the windowes, said with a loud voyce, that the holy Ghost was descended, and opening his armes to receiue it fell downe backward and broke his pate, from thence being carryed to his bed, wee continued drinking to our new vocations till the day peept out, at which time reeling to the Franciscan Monastery entered himselfe into their Order, they neuer examining the cause of this suddaine vocation, being glad of such a prize, shaued his crowne and inuested him in their ornaments, M. <hi>S.</hi> and M. <hi>Fowler</hi> going to the Monkes were admitted with the like ioy at the same instant. But I taking my leaue of them at the monastery doore, said that I for my part was onely in jest with them. But this being noy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed about the Vniuersity, it came to Doctor <hi>Kel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lisons</hi> eare, vnder whose charge these new Fryers were, who sent for me, and said he much admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that such a thing should happen in my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, and if that they had intended religion they might haue beene secular Priests in his Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, it being for them more profitable and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable: I answered that I thought it impossible
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:19982:34"/>
to gouerne the wils of other men, and supposed my selfe happy in keeping my selfe from the like shauing. Vpon this answer the Doctor deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of me in what case they were when they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered themselues, to whom I said they might thanke their god <hi>Bacchus</hi> more then any thing else for their new orders, which he hearing tooke his leaue of me and went to the Franciscans, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with M. <hi>Bredley</hi> a Priest M. <hi>Parkers</hi> cozen. So I leauing the Vniuersity went to <hi>Brux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els,</hi> and from thence to <hi>Bradah:</hi> but <hi>Bradley</hi> being denyed enterance by the Fryer, who said it was against their Orders for any one to speake with any of their Nouices, * leapt ouer the Garden<note place="margin">For so they terme all the first yeere.</note> wall, &amp; got vnder his Cozens window, calling &amp; saying vnto him, Cozen, Cozen, consider I pray that you haue taken a religious Order without knowledge of mother, brother, or kindred, and that your vocation is not good, being vndertaken in a hot braine His Cozen hearing this &amp; being counselled by the Fryers, he opened his window and said, <hi>discedito à me Satan.</hi> Six dayes after be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a better temper, perceiuing his owne fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, desired to depart from thence, which hee did with great difficulty, for hee was perswaded by the Fryer, that if euer hee departed from them, being entered, he lost the saluation of his soule. To whom he answered that hee intended this journey for <hi>England</hi> to receiue his portion; and taking leaue of his friends to returne againe. Vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which promise they suffered him to depart. Thence comming into <hi>England,</hi> was receiued of
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:19982:34"/>
his friends, and not suffered to returne, onely sent a summe of money to maintaine their Couent. The Fryers perceiuing that he should neuer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne, preached against his Cozen <hi>B.</hi> and other Priests for diswading him from his returne. But concerning M. <hi>S.</hi> and M. <hi>Fowler,</hi> who were ente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red into the Benedictine monastery, whose ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample encouraged M. <hi>Alex.

After these kindnesses they bare a more rough hand ouer them, and amongst the rest Doctor <hi>Radisend</hi> their President, vpon slight occasion enioyned these Gentlemen to pennance, which was, that they should prostrate themselues at the inward Chappell doore whilst the rest of the Monks came in and sang Vespers. Whereupon some of the brauer sort to shew their authority, would tread somewhat hard vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, and their long lying on the ground, with their hard pressing, caused them to let flye backward, insomuch that the sent compelled the Fryers to depart the Chappell. A while after these Gentlemen perceiuing their hard vsage, departed their monastery, resoluing for <hi>England,</hi> although they had promised (desiring to bee freed from their bondage) to make aspeedy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne, which they neuer performed to this houre.</p>

                  <p>This Chapter containeth the state and demeanour of the <hi>English</hi> Fugitiues vnder the King of <hi>Spaine</hi> his Dominions and else where, with a Catalogue of the Colledges and Monasteries belonging to our <hi>English</hi> Iesuites, Monkes, and Seminary Priests beyond the Seas.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Vt gentle Reader, giue me leaue a little to digresse, and reckon vp vnto you the state of our <hi>English</hi> Fugitiues in the Court of <hi>Spaine,</hi> and first and formost S. <hi>Anthony Shurley,</hi> who stiles himselfe Earle of the sacred <hi>Romane</hi> Empire, and hath from his Catholike Maiesty a pension of 2000. duckets <hi>per annum,</hi> all which in respect of his prodigality is as much as nothing. This S. <hi>Anthony Shurley</hi> is a great plotter and proiector in matters of State, and vndertakes by sea-stratagems to inuade and ruinate his natiue Countrey, a just treatise of whose passages would take vp a whole volume.</p>
               <p>Next vnto him there is one Sir <hi>Edward Bain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> who was a grand complotter of the Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powder treason, and an agent for all the rest to <hi>Flanders, Rome,</hi> and <hi>Spaine,</hi> at which place hee liued for foure or fiue yeeres in great reputation and esteeme. In <hi>Spaine</hi> he grew familiar with <hi>Creswell,</hi> but the Gunpowder treason taking no effect, they forthwith fell to difference, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing spent 12000 pounds sterling which he car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:19982:35"/>
out of <hi>England</hi> with him, he fell into great misery wherein he liues to this day, and (because his plot failed) he is neither countenanced by his Catholike Maiesty, nor by the Iesuites who se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced him. I being in his company at <hi>Madrid,</hi> and telling him of <hi>Creswels</hi> death, he made an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer that hee hoped he was in the deepest pit of hell, hauing beene the occasion of his ruine, with many others.</p>
               <p>Likewise there is one M. <hi>Iohn Persall,</hi> who is a meere formalist, and hath for his pension of his Catholike Maiesty 20 crownes a month; but were it not for <hi>Don Duarte</hi> brother to the Duke of <hi>Braganza,</hi> who relieues him now and then, he might starue with hunger notwithstanding his pension.</p>
               <p>There is also one M. <hi>William Sadler,</hi> who hath<note place="margin">These pensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are but onely as a baite to allure others: for they are sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer paid.</note> 40 crownes monthly pension from his Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Maiesty, who neuerthelesse were it not for his wiues sake he might keepe lent all the yeere long, for she with her daughter brings him gold and siluer without going to the <hi>Indies.</hi> Moreouer there is one M. <hi>Henry Butler,</hi> which teacheth his Catholike Maiesty to play on the Violl, a man very fantasticall, but one who hath his pension truely payd him for his fingers sake. Also there is one M. <hi>Burton</hi> who liues by his wits. Also there is one mistresse <hi>Mary Monpersons</hi> who liues by trading.</p>
               <p>Againe, there is one M. <hi>Anthony Pinto,</hi> some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times a seruant to <hi>Creswell,</hi> who seeing how ill the <hi>English</hi> Fugitiues were treated, discarded
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:19982:36"/>
the name of an <hi>English</hi> man, and now pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth for a <hi>Spaniard,</hi> and thereby liueth farre better then the rest, being one no lesse subtile then his master: thus much for the <hi>English</hi> secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Fugitiues of note at <hi>Madrid.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But now let vs come to the Clearkes and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious men. First, to the <hi>English</hi> Iesuites whose Agent and Procurator generall is Father <hi>North,</hi> one for policy, very subtile and dangerous. This <hi>North</hi> was created D. D. in <hi>Paris,</hi> and was some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times Vice-President of the Colledge of <hi>Doway,</hi> and afterwards turned Iesuite. Agent and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curator generall for the <hi>English</hi> Monks, is one Father <hi>Boniface,</hi> a very crafty fox, and a Smiths sonne in <hi>Redding,</hi> hee is so ambitious and haugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that he will not acknowledge his parentage, but giues out he is some great Gentlemans Son. As for the secular Priests they haue one <hi>Missen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi> for their Procurator generall, a simple fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, but wonderfully malitious. Now touching those of the <hi>Scottish</hi> Nation which reside in the Court of <hi>Spaine,</hi> there is none of account but Colonell <hi>Simple,</hi> who betrayed a towne in <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> to the <hi>Spaniards</hi> some 30 yeeres since, and receiued 25000 crownes for requitall of his treachery, and now liuing in <hi>Spaine,</hi> hath lately begun a foundation of a <hi>Scottish</hi> Seminary, the Prefect or Rector whereof, he intendeth to make his base sonne <hi>Hugh Simple,</hi> whom he hath trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned vp in the <hi>Spanish</hi> Iesuites Seminaries, one who may proue as treacherous a companion as euer was his father. For his Maiesty now of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
                  <pb n="65" facs="tcp:19982:36"/>
being in the Court of <hi>Spaine,</hi> hee gaue vp diuerse petitions &amp; aduertisements to the King and Counsell of <hi>Spaine</hi> that they should not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude any match with <hi>England,</hi> vnlesse there should be erected in each Vniuersity vnder our King his Dominions a Colledge of Iesuites for the trayning vp of youth in the <hi>Romane</hi> faith and doctrine, and to shew himselfe the more zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, printed these said aduertisements with his name subscribed, and deliuered them to his friends of the Court. As for the <hi>Irish</hi> Fugitiues, there are more of them then of any other, the streete wherein they lodge is by the <hi>Spaniards</hi> termed the lowsie streete, and as for their quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, saue these that follow: First, he that pretends to be Bishop of <hi>Aramath,</hi> and <hi>Dublin,</hi> then the Earle of <hi>Beere-hauen,</hi> with two or three more of the King his Pages, all the rest are meere chea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and vagabonds. The said Bishop and Earle are Agents for <hi>Tyron</hi> and <hi>Terconwell,</hi> who liue in <hi>Flanders</hi> in the Archdutchesses Court, and from them to other Papists in <hi>Ireland,</hi> they daily importune his Catholike Maiesty &amp; his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell to inuade the said Kingdome with an army, not doubting but it shall bee deliuered vp into his hands, from which their sollicitation they could not forbeare euen when our King was in <hi>Spaine.</hi> And thus much for the <hi>English, Scottish,</hi> and <hi>Irish</hi> Fugitiues which are at this present re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sident in the Court of <hi>Spaine.</hi> Now for the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges &amp; Seminaries of the Iesuites, Monks, and Fryers, and other Seminary Priests, I remit the
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:19982:37"/>
Reader to <hi>Lewis Owen</hi> his running Register in the publike Library at <hi>Oxford,</hi> of which he may at large see which I will here but name; as the Colledge at <hi>Vallidolid,</hi> and that at <hi>Siuill,</hi> and the Residence at <hi>Madrid,</hi> and another at S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Lucas,</hi> another at <hi>Lisbon,</hi> of which a secular Priest, one <hi>Numan</hi> by name is the head, who is now in suite with the Iesuites about the propriety thereof, but especially because there is one <hi>Don Pedro Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinio</hi> a <hi>Portugall</hi> Gentleman, who was once go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernor of <hi>Baia</hi> in <hi>Brasill,</hi> who by reason of his great corruption and vnlawfull gifts he receiued there at his returne from <hi>Spaine,</hi> fearing least he should bee examined by his Maiesty how hee came by these great riches, he had to bring the world into a good conceite of him professed that he would build a Colledge for the educati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of 100 <hi>English</hi> youths, which after they had beene trained vp there, might returne to their Countrey and conuert many to the <hi>Romane</hi> obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, of which Colledge hee promised the said <hi>Numan</hi> to be head, and likewise hee made the same promise to the <hi>English</hi> Iesuites, that one of them should bee head, if his Holinesse would approue thereof, and hereupon engaged them so deepe in the Law, that 20 yeares try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all will scarce end their controuersie, hee in the meane time derideth both parties, hauing no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention at all to performe what hee hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised.</p>
               <p>But neuerthelesse one <hi>Haruy</hi> a secular Priest, <hi>Numans</hi> Agent here in <hi>England</hi> for the getting
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:19982:37"/>
ouer of youth, perswadeth the Catholikes and their Bishop of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> that without doubt Father <hi>Numan</hi> will ouerthrow the Iesuites. As for any <hi>Scottish</hi> Colledge or Seminary there is none, sauing that which Colonell <hi>Simple</hi> is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning in <hi>Madrid.</hi> As for the <hi>Irish</hi> they haue three, one in <hi>Salamanca,</hi> another in <hi>Siuill,</hi> and a third in <hi>Lisbon.</hi> As for <hi>English</hi> Nunneries, there is only one which is at <hi>Lisbone,</hi> whereof you may read more at large in <hi>Robinson,</hi> and thus much for <hi>Spaine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for <hi>English</hi> Fugitiues in <hi>Italy,</hi> there are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry few. At <hi>Millaine</hi> there resideth Sir <hi>Thomas Stukeley,</hi> who hath 100 crownes a month pensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from the King of <hi>Spaine.</hi> This <hi>Stukeley</hi> is a grand traytor, and enemy to his Countrey, and were it not for the Duke of <hi>Feria,</hi> who entertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth him at his owne table, he might long since haue rode backe to <hi>Madrid</hi> on an Asse as hee came.</p>
               <p>Likewise there is one <hi>Webb,</hi> a retainer to the King of <hi>Spaine,</hi> who liueth wonderfull poorely. As for the City of <hi>Florence,</hi> there liueth Sir <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert Dudley,</hi> who styleth himselfe Duke of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thumberland,</hi> who left <hi>England</hi> because hee could not be suffered to enioy a second wife, his first wife then suruiuing. This <hi>Dudley</hi> now enioyeth his second wife by a dispensation from his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse, and is in great esteeme with the Duke of <hi>Florence,</hi> in regard of his Art in contriuing and fabricating of ships, and Gallyes; and hath ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained of the Emperour to bee declared Duke
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:19982:38"/>
of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> who hath giuen him the title already, and the land when he can catch it.</p>
               <p>Now let vs come to <hi>Rome,</hi> where of all places of <hi>Italy</hi> we haue but one <hi>English</hi> Colledge, (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides the residence of the <hi>English</hi> Iesuitrices, who spoke Latine to his Holinesse, to the end that he should confirme their Order, and their sufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy (though women) for preaching the Gospell to all Nations, euen to Turkes and Infidels, men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in my third Chapter,) whereof Father <hi>Fitz Herbert</hi> is the Rector, who had beene be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a pensiuner, and spye to the King of <hi>Spaine</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> and his seruice being past, and his pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion failing him, out of pure necessity he and his man were constrained to turne Iesuites, or else starue. And hee being a worthy scholler and a great polititian, was very welcome to that Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. But to come from <hi>Italy</hi> to <hi>Flanders,</hi> our <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi> Fugitiues liuing there, are as follow: Sir <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Stanley,</hi> who betrayed <hi>Deuentre</hi> a towne in <hi>Holland</hi> to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> this Knight laments now his misfortunes, and sayes he hath out-liued his friends, and in the yeere 1624. hee was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained to goe to <hi>Spaine</hi> in his old age, hauing now seene 95 yeeres, and there to goe Cap in hand to all the priuy Counsellors, to craue his pension which had not beene paid him in six yeeres before. And after he had spent 3 monthes in petitioning them, they granted him 10000. crownes, and the title of an Earle to sell, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow on whom he pleased; and thus he returned to <hi>Flanders</hi> leauing his money in the handes of a
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:19982:38"/>
                  <hi>Spanish</hi> Iesuite Father <hi>Antonio Vasques</hi> by name, who promised to returne it for him by a bill of Exchange, but neuer did it to this day. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon seeing himselfe thus cozened in his old age, turned Carthusian at <hi>Austend,</hi> and gaue the Carthusians there his Plate, and that little mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney which he had, where I haue heard him often complaine of the Iesuites, and say he was hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily sorry to finde them such knaues, and that if his Maiesty of great <hi>Britaine</hi> would grant him pardon, and leaue to liue the rest of his daies in <hi>Eancashire</hi> with beefe and bagge-pudding, hee should deeme himselfe one of the happiest in the world; but this could neuer bee obtained of his aforesaid Maiesty hee hauing beene so great and notorious a traytour.</p>
               <p>Likewise there is one <hi>Neuill,</hi> who stiles him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe Earle of <hi>Westmerland,</hi> but his Earledome many times will scarce furnish him with a din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,<note place="margin">This <hi>Neuils</hi> first wife is yet liuing in <hi>London.</hi>
                  </note> and were it not for his * second wife who playeth the shee Physitian in the <hi>Archdutches</hi> Court, hee might be put oft times to narrower shifts, notwithstanding his 100 crownes pension a month.</p>
               <p>There is also one Sir <hi>Thomas Leige,</hi> who not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding his 40 crownes pension a month in the Castle of <hi>Antwerpe,</hi> for a man of his fashi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his wife and children liue in a very meane estate.</p>
               <p>Amongst all these Sir <hi>Griffin Markham</hi> hath gone the best way to raise his fortunes; hauing got into fauour with the Duke of <hi>Nuburge</hi> who
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:19982:39"/>
giues him the surest pension of all. This Sir <hi>Grif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin Markham</hi> at his first arriuall at <hi>Bruxels</hi> being kept vnder by the Iesuites, was driuen to such an exigency that he was constrained to plucke out the inlaid siluer of the hilts of his sword, to buy flower to make an hasty pudding for his dinner. There also is one M. <hi>Ward,</hi> who notwithstanding the pension of 40 crownes monthly, liues in great want. Mr. <hi>Young</hi> likewise hauing like al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance, and sharing in the same misery.

               </p>
               <p>There remaine also at <hi>Bruxels</hi> one <hi>Lerde Lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleton,</hi> who notwithstanding his fathers seruices to the Pope, and his 40. crownes a month pensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is in the same predicament with the rest.</p>
               <p>Now for the <hi>Irish,</hi> as <hi>Tyron</hi> and <hi>Terconnell,</hi> they haue some pittance allowed them, and especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Tyron;</hi> who hath a regiment of three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand <hi>Irish</hi> vnder him; wherewith he projecteth with supply from <hi>Spaine,</hi> to inuade and surprize <hi>Ireland.</hi> And thus farre of our secular Fugitiues.</p>
               <p>Now take a Catalogue of the Monasteries, Seminaries, and Nunneries in <hi>Flanders:</hi> First, at <hi>Bruxels,</hi> there is a Nunnery of <hi>English</hi> Nunnes, of the Order of S. <hi>Benedict,</hi> the Abbatisse where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is the now Lord <hi>Northumberland</hi> his sister, and hath vnder her tuition some 60 <hi>English</hi> Damsels. The ghostly Fathers that are ouerseers of this monastery, are two <hi>English</hi> Iesuites, Father <hi>Gardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,</hi> and Father <hi>Walgraue</hi> alias <hi>Flower,</hi> who are likewise Agents for the Iesuites in <hi>England,</hi> and intelligencers for the Archduchesse.</p>
               <p>There is besides another Nunnery of the third Order of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Francis,</hi> which is gouerned by one Father <hi>Bell</hi> a Fryer of the same Order: and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at <hi>Cambray</hi> of the Order of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Benedict,</hi> which is gouerned by two Monks of the same Order, as Father <hi>Leander,</hi> Father <hi>Rudessend.</hi> Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at <hi>Louaine</hi> and <hi>Gaunt,</hi> which are likewise go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerned by the Iesuites, another at <hi>Graueling</hi> of poore <hi>Clares,</hi> gouerned by the Iesuites, as also are
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:19982:40" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the Residencies of the Iesuites, that are at S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Omers, Leige,</hi> and <hi>Colen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is also a monastery of the <hi>English</hi> poore <hi>Terresians</hi> at <hi>Antwerpe,</hi> gouerned by one Doctor <hi>Wright</hi> a secular Priest, all which foresaid Nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neries of them containe at least 40. or 50. Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels which are most of them Gentlemens daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of very great fashion in <hi>England,</hi> and the rest some Chambermaids which hauing beene by the Iesuites well rigd of their maidenhead, and something old, are sent ouer to these or such like places to do penance for their sins in a Nunnery, where it is much doubted that they continue neuerthelesse in their old courses, &amp; intice like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise the young Dames to the same.</p>
               <p>For not many yeeres since, one <hi>Ward</hi> a secular Priest, and Chaplaine to the <hi>English</hi> Nunnery at <hi>Bruxels,</hi> falling in League with some of them, got from them about three or foure hundered pounds worth of iewels and diamonds, which the Iesuites smelling out, turned him out of his place; telling him that he had vsed juggling and dishonest meanes to come by that which he had gotten from the Monastery: And in the yeere 1625. there arose the like difference betweene D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Clement,</hi> Deane of S. <hi>Trigoules</hi> at <hi>Bruxels,</hi> and Vicar generall of the armies of his Catholike Maiesty, and Father <hi>Iames Harford</hi> Chaplaine to a Company. Doctor <hi>Clement</hi> accused Father <hi>Harford</hi> of dishonesty with another mans wife, and <hi>Harford</hi> accused him for being dishonest with his owne Neece, and for a glutton and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitable
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:19982:41"/>
man, saying hee had seene him dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorge his stomacke of whole Capons legges at once; whereupon Father <hi>Ramyres</hi> Canon of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Trigonles,</hi> one guilty in the same kinde, reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led them for feare of further scandall.</p>
               <p>But to come from their Nunneries to their Colledges, as first to S. <hi>Omers,</hi> which I haue fully decyphered in my third Chapter: next that at <hi>Doway,</hi> whereof D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Kellison</hi> is President: next that Monastery of Benedictine Monks, of which Father <hi>Rudessend</hi> is the President, with whom Sir <hi>Herbert Crafts</hi> leads a Monasticall life. There is also a Monastery of <hi>English</hi> Franciscan Fryers, besides two more Colledges, the one consisting of <hi>Irish,</hi> the other of <hi>Scottish</hi> men. To these the Iesuites haue a Colledge at <hi>Watton,</hi> not farre di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant from S. <hi>Omers,</hi> which they call their No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiship for the nurturing of their young Iesuites, Father <hi>Benefield</hi> being Rector thereof. Another they haue seated in <hi>Gaunt,</hi> which is intituled <hi>Casa professa.</hi> Another vnder the Prince of <hi>Leige,</hi> that was founded with those monyes which were got from M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>S.</hi> whereof in the second Chapter. The discipline they vse in this Colledge to their Nouices, is in teaching. Philosophy and Diuini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Father <hi>Sherley</hi> being their Rector. As for your Monks, they haue besides these, three mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasteries; one in <hi>Paris</hi> in the Suburbs of S. <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane,</hi> whereof Father <hi>Bernard</hi> alias <hi>Berington</hi> is Prior; this was he that imprisoned <hi>Barnes</hi> that famous Monke, who was comming for <hi>England,</hi> who is likewise the greatest intelligencer to the
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:19982:41"/>
                  <hi>Spanish</hi> Embassador against our State. The other two Monasteries are scituated one at S. <hi>Mallowes</hi> in <hi>Brittany,</hi> and the other at <hi>Nausey</hi> in <hi>Lorane.</hi> Concerning your secular Priests, they haue one Colledge in <hi>Paris,</hi> by the name of <hi>Arras</hi> Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</p>
               <p>As for your <hi>English</hi> Fugitiues, it is with them as followeth. First, at <hi>Rhemes</hi> liues D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Gifford</hi> Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate of <hi>France,</hi> and Archbishop of <hi>Rhemes,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Gwies</hi> reseruing all the reuenewes thereof for his owne Kitchin, deducting onely to the Archbishop 2000 pound annually. At <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris</hi> liues D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Bradshaw,</hi> D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Mailer,</hi> and M. <hi>Fosser,</hi> a secular Gentleman; who at the Queenes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to <hi>England</hi> was aduocate to her Maiesty in the behalfe of the Catholikes in this Land; but he hauing vnderstood, that intelligence was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to the Archbishops Grace of <hi>Canterbury</hi> concerning his carriage, hee retired to <hi>France</hi> with all expedition, where failing of these large promises formerly made to him, liues in misery and extreame pouerty.</p>
               <p>By this may be discerned the number of our <hi>English</hi> Fugitiues, with their Colledges, Nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neries, and Monasteries beyond the seas, which yeerely draw out of our Land 100. at least of young Gentlemen, and Gentlewomen, who al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they pretend conscience, and want of charity here, the occasion of their departure, yet none (I dare say) in the world, they being gone ouer, more enuious and hard hearted then they themselues each to other. As your priuate Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:19982:42"/>
Fugitiues hunt after aduancement by dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paraging others of their owne rancke; your Priests disparage the Iesuites; the Iesuites the Priests; the Priests againe the Monkes; the Monks the Fryers, and the Iesuites all. Insomuch that if you visit any of them, your entertaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment shall be scarce any thing, saue their vpbrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, and exclamations against one anothers monasteries and priuate persons: so that it would be no small paines for a man, so long to trauaile amongst them, vntill hee might finde three persons to speake well each of other: this being a fault so common amongst them, that they are noted among all Nations whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer with whom they conuerse. Others there are whose most earnest expectation and heartiest de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire is, the ruine and vtter destruction of their owne natiue Country, which is the issue of their departure, and accordingly God doth prosper them, laying on them the like punishment he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted on the <hi>Iewes,</hi> by dispersing of them through many Nations, and giuing them vp to dissension among themselues, and liuing in great want and misery.</p>

                  <p>This eight Chapter containes the cause why hee left the seruice of his Catholike Maiesty and came for <hi>England,</hi> and returned to the bosome of his true mother the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and the iniuries and aduentures he suffered in <hi>France,</hi> till he arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the <hi>English</hi> shoares.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Irst, though a child and hauing not as yet attained the yeeres of discretion, I was still (as all men are by a naturall inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) well affected towards my natiue soyle; which the Iesuites collecting from me, pressed me, and declared daily to me how much I was obliged vnto God for deliuering me out of the bondage of errour and heresie in my very infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and diswaded mee withall from conuersing with any of my natiue Countrey which were not of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> vpon paine of being anathematiz'd, and rejected out of the same ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Catholike Church. And when they heard of the decease of my grand-father and other kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, they charged me not to wish a <hi>requiem</hi> to their soules because they were heretickes, and so consequently are damned in hell, and comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded me to pray to the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> and all the Saints in heauen for the rest of my suruiuing friends, that they might at length become Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selites to the <hi>Romane</hi> faith and obedience.</p>
               <p>When I came to be 18 yeeres of age or there
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:19982:43"/>
aboutes, I vndertooke in secret to read and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>use the sacred scriptures, and being curious to know the grounds of the differences betweene the Protestants &amp; our selues, as of those: of the Popes supremacy, the reall presence of Christ in the holy Eucharist, the Indulgences, pardons, and profits of Purgatory, with the Popes autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to depose and set vp Kings, I began likewise to enquire into, and examine the liues and cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of our Iesuites and Priests, and moreouer I superuised the letter of D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Hall</hi> and M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Bedell,</hi> which I found in my Fathers study, and after I had conserred one thing with another, I found more resemblance and probability of the truth in the Protestants religion then in our owne. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides this, I neuer found any pregnant proofe they had out of the Scriptures, that the Pope was the onely head of the Church militant, or any good authentique argument for Purgatory, Indulgences, holy graines, Meddals, and the like; as for the reall presence, I could neuer obtaine fully of my selfe to beleeue it. And as for the Popes Bull, for which each person from seuen yeeres of age and vpwards giues 12 pence to his Catholike Maiesty, by vertue whereof hee may eate * <hi>grossura,</hi> with egges, milke, butter, cheese,<note place="margin">This <hi>grossura,</hi> is the same with that wee call grosse meat.</note> and the like, on Saturdayes and such like dayes; I perceiued it to bee a meere policy and tricke of the King to fill his coffers, the Pope giuing him way, and partly sharing with him. Now touching their miracles they pretend to be dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly done in <hi>Spaine, Flanders, Italy,</hi> and other parts,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:19982:43"/>
(though inquisitiue there abouts) yet I neuer could see any. And as for the holy Crucifix which is in the Suburbs of the City <hi>Burgus,</hi> which they shew to great personages, as if it were Christ himselfe, telling them that his haire and nailes do grow miraculously, which they cut and paire monthly, &amp; giue to Noblemen as holy reliques, I iudge it a thing incredible, &amp; thereby all their pretended miracles to be but meere Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postures.<note place="margin">King <hi>Charles</hi> by the Infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas intreaty visited this Nunne when he was in <hi>Spaine.</hi>
                  </note> As likewise the grand miracle of * <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mana Luisa</hi> the Nunne of <hi>Carrion,</hi> who for twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty yeeres space hath liued by the bare receipt of the hoste, which to belieue I thinke argues a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry sottish credulity, and infinite other miracles and reliques which they haue, I haue found to be meere cheats and cosenages. As also their Mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses for the dead, and deliuering of soules out of Purgatory, by saying Masses for them on a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiledged altar. Nay some of them make spels of their reliques, as <hi>Peter Godsrey,</hi> that famous Priest<note place="margin">Read at large hereof in the <hi>French</hi>

<pb n="80" facs="tcp:19982:44"/>
and herein that it is lawfull and meritorious to lye and write such things to that end the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people might with greater zeale serue God and his Saints, and that otherwise there would be no meanes to gouerne them, and espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially to draw the women to good order, being by nature more facile and credulous, and for the most part addicted to nouelties and miraculous euents.</p>
               <p>Likewise it is their Doctrine, that it is a meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious deed to kill or depo e any King or prince excommunicated by the Sea of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Likewise, the discontent of my Father after his death, and his Letters to his Brother in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> gaue me to vnderstand, that the <hi>Romane</hi> Faith was not the surest way to Saluation.</p>
               <p>Likewise, these most abhominable dealings that are vsed at the Election of their Popes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing chosen for the most part by fauour and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys, their Predecessors being extinguished by Poyson and villainous meanes, and for which ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect the King of <hi>Spaine</hi> hath Ambassadors con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually employed at <hi>Rome,</hi> which Ambassadors doe conferre great largesses of annuall pensions to enflame them to nominate him Pope whom<note place="margin">Omnia voena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia Romae.</note> he pleaseth. The like doth the King of <hi>France</hi> by his Ambassadors, but the <hi>Spanish Indian</hi> Oyle for the most part greaseth home to the purpose. For when the <hi>Spaniards</hi> saw the King of <hi>France</hi> to enuade the <hi>Valtoline,</hi> the yeere 1624, that the Pope tooke his part as one of his creation, they began to cast out Libels, and set them vpon the
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:19982:44"/>
Pasquill of <hi>Rome,</hi> threatning the Pope with a suddaine end if he did not recant, which he did, for feare that the <hi>Spanish</hi> Venome might not operate in his Stomacke.</p>
               <p>Likewise, the detention of the Kingdome of <hi>Naples</hi> from the Pope confirmed me that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> were, and are little better then <hi>Atheists,</hi> onely making vse of the Pope for their owne particular ambition and ends, as to confirme and establish him in vnlawful Monarchies, and vnder colour of Religion to make Subiects become Slaues.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth sacking <hi>Rome,</hi> and with his Army besieging the Pope in his Castle of S. <hi>Angelo,</hi> was to this particular end, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme him Emperor, and to colour and maintain all his vnlawfull vsurpations.</p>
               <p>Likewise, it confirmed me in the Protestants Religion, to see how in <hi>Flanders</hi> and other parts, the Iesuites, Fryers, and others, before they enter their Colledges, Monasteries, and other Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Houses, to be Probationers only for a weeke or a moneth, their Friends, Parents, or others giue them a good summe of money to spend in Ale-Houses, Tauernes, and other prophane Houses, for to take their fare-well of the world. Of this I was an eye witnesse both at <hi>Antwerpe</hi> and <hi>Doway.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Likewise it confirmed me in the said Religion to see Protestants with whom I conuersed to be so modest, religious, and honest, quite contrarie to the report of the Iesuites which make them
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:19982:45"/>
worse then Diuels. All which I hauing well considered with my selfe, and also obseruing the cozenages and impostures of the Iesuits, Priests and Monkes in S. <hi>Omers, Doway, Flanders, Spaine, France,</hi> and else-where, my Father being dead, and I at my owne disposall, I came for <hi>England,</hi> where intending to declare my selfe a Protestant, was aduertised by some great Personages of au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie in this Kingdome, to keepe my resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to my selfe for a while, whereby I might discouer the plots and stratagems of our aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries, and so doe my Countrey farre greater seruice. Whereupon I straight made my repaire to the Court of the Archduchesse, where being suspected as a Spy, and in great hazard of my life by the negligence of some who had imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me, I had forth-with beene imprisoned had not Earle <hi>Gondamor</hi> interceded for me, who ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer could be perswaded that euer I would turne Protestant, being so long confirmed in the <hi>Romish</hi> Religion.

There were in the house 5 or 6 Papists, who were likewise the same time bound for <hi>England,</hi> which knew me, but being disguised, some in the habit of Merchants, others of swaggering trauailers, I could hardly discry them, but they after they had well viewed mee, began to consult among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues what they had best doe, for said they, if I went for <hi>England</hi> in the same ship, without doubt I should descry them, and besides that I intended no good for the Catholikes in <hi>England,</hi> hauing forgone my pension and seruice to the King of <hi>Spaine,</hi> &amp; aboue all forsaken my Mother, Vnckle, Brothers, and Sisters, and so resolued to accuse me vpon pretence of being a Spye to the Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> and that I was by him sent to betray the Kingdome, which resolued, they begunne to doubt whether it were I or no, and therefore the tide seruing, began to embarke themselues, and I with them, where being together, I called two of them to minde, the one was named <hi>George Gage,</hi> who had halfe his nose eaten away with a C<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

prison: At entrance into the prison he told mee that I should doe well to confesse the truth vnto them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and reueale my imployments, and that hee well knew I was <hi>Buckinghams</hi> Spye for <hi>England,</hi> for which end I had receiued great summes of money to giue intelligence and betray their king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, to which I answered, I neuer had any thing to doe with the said Duke, but he told me I lyed, and that I was accused by Angels, (meaning the Iesuites) and commanded me to bee put in a cage, which was a kinde of dungeon on the top of the prison, neere the which stood the racke, and threatned mee therewith if I confessed not the truth, but I alwayes answered him that I was ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of what he questioned me, so he left mee alone for the present, lockt vnder seuen doores, where I remained for the space of three dayes without meate or drinke; at the end whereof they brought me a dish of tripes with a peece of bread and water, and afterwards I was freed from the Cage in the day time and had the liberty of the dungeon, they gaue mee a purse besides with a long cord to bee put out at a hole to beg almes of passengers, not hauing any victuals giuen me, but what I bought with the money I got for Gods sake, which God knowes was very little: And like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise I had not liberty to goe out of the roome to do what nature requires. My bed was straw, which in ten months had beene changed but thrice, without any couert at all. As for my shirt I neuer had any variety; as for my haire it grew wild and sauage-like; and for my companions they were
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:19982:49"/>
millions of lice and fleas, and in this wofull<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> plight I continued well nigh ten months, the aforesaid <hi>Gage</hi> with his companions being the cause there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. And to augment my misery, Father <hi>Baldwin,</hi> with the rest of the <hi>English</hi> Iesuites in S. <hi>Omers,</hi> not onely sent but came themselues to <hi>Callis</hi> to perswade the Gouernor for my continuall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint from liberty while my vitall spirits should continue within me.

And that they might rest the more assured of my detention, they made one <hi>Hudson</hi> an <hi>English</hi> man who there liues their chiefe Agent against me, whom onely for his wiues sake the Sergieant Maior of <hi>Callis,</hi> by name <hi>Buchero</hi> entertained.</p>
               <p>At length I perceiuing that my life was the marke that they shot at, they hauing not long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore through a mistake determined to haue hang'd me as one who had stole horses, had not the truth beene discouered by one <hi>Carpenter</hi> the King of <hi>France</hi> his Aduocate generall, and one of the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litest wits in the Kingdome for the Law, whose happe it was at that time to haue beene in prison with mee, whereupon duely weighing with my selfe the euents of my trauails, I seriously resolued (the Lord assisting mee) patiently to vndergoe what euer should by those blood-suckers bee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted vpon mee, raking it as a punishment iustly due vnto me for my sinnes, and it pleased God to second my resolutions, for presently after there

Colonell <hi>Gray</hi> a little af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter came likewise that way, and interceeded in like manner for me but could not preuaile.

The King of <hi>Denmarke</hi> his youngest sonne came by <hi>Callis</hi> at that time, and trauailing for <hi>Holland,</hi> did supplicate earnestly for mee, the Gouernor excusing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe to him, made answer, that it was not he, but the King that detained me. There was also S<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mund Vernam,</hi> and M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Haukins</hi> the Kings chiefe Agent did their best, but none could preuaile to set me at liberty, onely they relieued mee with some good pieces of money, which the jailour for the most part got from me, threatning to keepe me more priuate if he had not the better halfe of that I had, and finding the sweetnesse thereof, there passed not one but he priuately for his owne
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:19982:50"/>
lucre acquainted them with my misery. At length there came a Gentleman of <hi>Freezland,</hi> by name <hi>Scipio Intima,</hi> who had beene my fellow prisoner in <hi>Paris,</hi> this young Gentleman was of a proper and comely feature, and of such carriage and nimble wit as a man might possibly meete with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all; I seeing him passe by my grate and knowing him, called to him out of the grate, and acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him with my vniust detention, who presently wrought so effectually with the Gouernors wife and daughters, whom he certified of my innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and misery, insomuch that they tooke great pity vpon me, and acquainted the Warden of the Capuchins, who then was with them therewith; and he vpon their relation came forthwith to visit me, and commiserated my estate likewise, and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Gouernor told him thereof, who vrged great matters against me, and said that I was <hi>reus laesae Maiestatis;</hi> but his wife and daughters se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conding this his earnest solliciting, and this young Gentleman swearing and protesting my great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency, did so farre preuaile with the Gouernor, that he gaue way that I might haue an equall try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al by Law, which before I could not obtaine, and gaue leaue that the Kings Aduocate who was in prison with me, might be my Councellor. All which being granted, my Aduocate begunne to write the occasion of my vnlawfull detention, with a petition which hee sent to the High Court of Parliament at <hi>Paris,</hi> where the Court of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment commanded all my aduersaries and accusers to be personally cited before them, and to bring
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:19982:51"/>
in their allegations and accusations against me. My Aduocate did likewise challenge the Law of the Kingdome, which is, that no malefactor can be kept in prison aboue three months, but hee must haue either the sentence of life or death to passe on him, vnlesse it be for treason against the Kings proper person; I hauing continued eight months in prison contrary to the foresaid Law, vrged like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise that saying, <hi>quis enim innocens esse poterit si accusari solummodo sufficiat,</hi> All this was so well set sorth by my said Aduocate, that there was none to proue any thing against mee, so that the High Court of Parliament pronounced me innocent, and condemned the Sergieant Maior of <hi>Callis,</hi> and the rest of my aduersaries, to the reparation of honor, dammage, and interest, and forthwith I was restored to my former liberty. Thus giuing hearty thankes to Almighty God for this his gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious deliuerance, and freeing me at such time as I least imagined, out of the hands of these infernall monsters, and blood-suckers, the Iesuites and their faction.</p>
               <p>And presently comming for <hi>Douer</hi> I imbraced my natiue soyle with full resolution neuer to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part out of it, beseeching God to blesse me, and to make me (though vnworthy) a member of this his holy Church, whereunto through so many perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting afflictions and miseries I haue at length ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riued.</p>
               <p>Gentle Reader, here thou hast had a view of the trauailes, miseries, and obseruations of the <hi>English Spanish Pilgrime,</hi> wherein I vowe to God I haue
