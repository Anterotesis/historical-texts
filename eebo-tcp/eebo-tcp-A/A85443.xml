         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

why God ſent unto them no leſſe then two Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,
<hi>Haggai</hi> and <hi>Zachary,</hi> as two extraordinary
Ambaſſadours from heaven, on purpoſe to put
them on upon it, (for the finiſhing of the Temple
is a buſineſſe of that moment as is worth two Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
at any time.) And this appeares not onely
by both their Prophecies, but alſo by the ſtory,
<hi>Ezra 5. 1, 2. THEN the Prophet Haggai and Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariah
prophecyed unto the Jews that were in Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah,

Introduction to the expoſition of theſe words, ſet
you downe in, and give you a proſpect of thoſe
times, and the occurrences thereof, which were
the occaſion of theſe words here, <hi>[Who art thou O
great mountaine? &amp;c.]</hi> And if <hi>Zachary</hi> himſelfe, a
Prophet, and that lived in thoſe times, knew not at
the firſt the meaning of the Viſion in this Chapter,
<hi>ver. 5. (Knoweſt thou what theſe be? And I ſaid, No
my Lord)</hi> much leſſe ſhall we be able to know the
interpretation thereof, and how fitted to this vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
nor what this <hi>mountaine</hi> here is, &amp;c. without
being pre-poſſeſt of the knowledge of this ſtory,
which in briefe is this:</p>
            <p>The Babilonian Monarchy (Romes Type) had
trod downe the holy City, and laid waſte the
Temple and worſhip of God for ſeventy yeares;
which being expired, the Jews had liberty and
authority from the firſt Perſian King, <hi>Cyrus,</hi> to
build the Temple, and reſtore Gods worſhip,
according to their Law. This is the ſumme of the
firſt and ſecond Chapters of <hi>Ezra.</hi> In the third
Chapter you have an Altar ſet up, Sacrifices re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed,
Feaſts kept, and the foundation of the
Temple laid, (which was as true a Type of
that great Reformation from under Popery.) But
after this work had been begun, and fairely car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed
on in all the Fundamentals of it, there ſtar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
up a company of Samaritans, that were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries
to the Jewes, (as we read, <hi>Chap.</hi> 4.) Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maritans
they were, as appears by <hi>ver. 10. They
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:111727:5"/>
were the Nations ſeated in the City of Samaria, brought
thither, ver.</hi> 2. in the roome of the ten Tribes. A
generation of men, who were not heathens in
their profeſſion, for they profeſſed the ſame Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
with the Jewes. So they alledge for, and
arrogate to themſelves in the afore-ſaid verſe,
<hi>[We ſeeke your God as you doe, and we ſacrifice unto
him,</hi> and have done ſo long, <hi>from the dayes of Eſar
Haddon, who brought us up hither:]</hi> And yet they
were not true Jews neither, nor perfectly of the
ſame Religion, but of a mungrell and mixt kind
betweene the Religion of the Heathen and of the
Jews, intermingling Heatheniſh Idolatries with
Jewiſh worſhip. So 2 <hi>Kings 17. ver.</hi> 33. and 41.
compared, it is ſaid, <hi>Theſe Nations feared the Lord,
and ſerved their graven Images after the manner of
the Nations.</hi> Yea, they expected the ſame Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah
that the Jews did; <hi>I know that the Meſsiah com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth,
who is called Chriſt,</hi> (ſaith the woman of
Samaria) <hi>and he will tell us all things, John</hi> 4. 25.
Now theſe Samaritans were <hi>Adverſaries</hi> to the
Jews, (as they are called, <hi>ver.</hi> 1.) and ſo unto
their Temple, and the finiſhing of it: And yet at
firſt they were but <hi>under-hand adverſaries,</hi> for they
friendly offer to build with them, <hi>[Let us build
with you, ver.</hi> 2.] but ſo as with an intent to have
defiled and ſpoiled the work. <hi>Zerubbabel</hi> and thoſe
other <hi>builders refuſing</hi> them, they grew thereupon
enraged, and openly profeſſed their oppoſition;
both <hi>weakning</hi> and diſcouraging <hi>the hands of the
people:</hi> and alſo when they could not altogether
hinder it, then they <hi>troubled them</hi> (all they could)
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:111727:5"/>
               <hi>in building,</hi> thus <hi>ver.</hi> 4. And they ceaſed not here,
but further, they incenſed, and made the Court
againſt them, (they growing potent there) both
by <hi>hiring counſellours againſt them, ver.</hi> 5. and alſo
by inſinuating to thoſe mighty Perſian Kings,
ſuch ſuggeſtions as they knew would take with
Monarchs, miſ-repreſenting theſe Jews unto
them, as of a rebellious ſpirit, oppoſite to Kings
and Monarchie; calling Jeruſalem <hi>that rebellious
and bad City,</hi> ſo <hi>ver. 12. hurtfull unto Kings and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces,</hi>
and that had of old time <hi>moved ſedition,</hi> ſo
<hi>ver.</hi> 15. (for even thus old is this ſcandall) and
that therefore theſe Jews muſt be kept under:
For <hi>if this City be builded, and the walls ſet up,</hi> &amp; they
once but get ſtrength, <hi>then they will not pay toll, tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute,
and cuſtome,</hi> but withdraw their allegeance, ſo
<hi>ver.</hi> 13. But on the contrary, for themſelves, they
profeſſe that they are their faithfull <hi>ſervants, v.</hi> 11.
and that which made them ſpeak, was onely a
tenderneſſe of the Kings honour; ſo <hi>ver. 14. Now
becauſe we have maintenance from the Kings palace,</hi>
(had their dependance wholly upon them) <hi>and
it was not meet for us to ſee the Kings diſhonour; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
have we certified the King.</hi> And by theſe their
flatteries and miſ-repreſentations they raiſed up
ſo great a <hi>mountain</hi> of oppoſition, (as it is here cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led)
that they <hi>fruſtrated</hi> the Jews good <hi>purpoſe</hi> of
perfecting the building, (as the words are, <hi>ver.</hi> 5.)
And though they could not prevaile ſo farre as to
throw downe the foundation laid; yet <hi>they made
them to ceaſe</hi> building any further <hi>by force and power,</hi>
ſo <hi>ver.</hi> 23. And thus the work did <hi>ceaſe,</hi> during <hi>all
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:111727:6"/>
the dayes of Cyrus,</hi> and the raigne of one or two
Kings more, even <hi>untill the ſecond yeare of Darius,
ver.</hi> 5. and 24. and <hi>THEN</hi> it was that theſe <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,
Haggai</hi> and <hi>Zechariah, did prophecie</hi> unto the
Jews, as it follows in the very next words,
<hi>Chap.</hi> 5. 1, 2. then when they had thus been over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>topt
by ſo potent a faction for many years, and
with oppoſition wearied out, then it was that
God ſtirred up our <hi>Zachary</hi> to put ſpirits into
them to revive the work again, and among other
viſions gave him this, (which is in this 4. <hi>Chapter)</hi>
of all the moſt eminent, to ſtrengthen them there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.
And ſo I have brought you to <hi>Zachary</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
and unto the words of my Text; And now
you ſhall ſee how neceſſary this ſtory was to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret
this his Prophecie, for which ſimply I have
related it.</p>
            <p>The words are (as was ſaid) the <hi>interpretation</hi>
of a <hi>Viſion;</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Expoſition of the words, and Viſion.</note> take in both: Let us therefore firſt view the <hi>Viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
and ſecondly, this the Angels <hi>Interpretation</hi> of
it, which are the two parts into which this whole
Chapter is reſolved.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Viſion</hi> is made up of two things:<note place="margin">In the Viſion, two parts.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, a <hi>glorious Candleſtick all of gold,</hi> with a
<hi>bowle</hi> or ceſterne upon the top of it, and with
ſeveu ſhafts, with ſeven lamps at the ends there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
all lighted.</p>
            <p>And ſecondly, that theſe <hi>Lamps</hi> might have a
perpetuall ſupply of <hi>Oyle,</hi> without any acceſſary
way of humane help, there are preſented (as
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:111727:6"/>
growing by the Candleſtick) <hi>two</hi> freſh and green
<hi>Olive trees on each ſide thereof, ver.</hi> 3. which doe
<hi>[empty out of themſelves] golden oyle, ver.</hi> 12. that
is, did naturally drop and diſtill it into that bowl,
and the two pipes thereof, to feed the lamps con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually.
A Viſion ſo cleare and full of light to
ſet forth the work then to be done by the Jews,
that the Angel wonders, that at the firſt ſight the
Prophet ſhould not underſtand it.</p>
            <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">1. The Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dleſticks, what.</note> this <hi>Candleſtick</hi> thus <hi>lighted,</hi> betokened the
full perfecting and finiſhing the Temple, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoring
the worſhip of God within it, unto its
full <hi>perfection of beauty</hi> and brightneſſe, (as the
Pſalmiſt ſpeaks.) And ſo the Angel interprets
it, <hi>This is the word of the Lord, ver.</hi> 6. that is, this
Hieroglyphique contains this word and mind of
God in it, that maugre all oppoſition, <hi>Zerubbabel</hi>
ſhould <hi>bring forth the head</hi> or <hi>top ſtone</hi> that ſhould
finiſh the Temple, ſo <hi>ver.</hi> 7. and 9.</p>
            <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2. Two Olive trees, who.</note> the <hi>two Olive trees</hi> betokened two
eminent rankes and ſorts of perſons that ſhould
give their aſſiſtance to this work:</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>Zerubbabel</hi> their Prince, and the <hi>Elders</hi> of
the people with him.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>Jeſhua</hi> the High-Prieſt, and the other
<hi>Prieſts</hi> with him. And of both theſe the Rabby
Doctours have long agoe expounded it.</p>
            <p>And accordingly, both in the ſtory <hi>Ezra</hi> 5. 2.
and in theſe two Prophets, we ſtill find mention
both of <hi>Zerubbabel</hi> and <hi>Jeſhua,</hi> as the Builders of
this houſe: Yet ſo, as <hi>collectivè</hi> under <hi>Zerubbabel,</hi>
the Elders, and under <hi>Jeſhua,</hi> the other Prieſts are
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:111727:7"/>
to be underſtood as included and intended. And
therefore in the 3. <hi>Chap.</hi> of this Prophecie, <hi>ver.</hi> 8.
when <hi>Jeſhua</hi> is ſpoken to, the other Prieſts his
fellowes are ſpoken to together with him, <hi>Heare
O Jeſhua, thou and [thy fellowes] that ſit before thee:</hi>
And in like manner when <hi>Zerubbabel</hi> is here ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
to in the Text, to build the Temple, <hi>the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
his fellowes</hi> are intended in him: And accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly
<hi>Ezra</hi> 6. 14. it is ſaid, that <hi>The Elders of the
Jewes builded and finiſhed the Temple.</hi> And ſo theſe
taken together, are the <hi>two Olive trees.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now concerning the firſt part of this Viſion,<note place="margin">How fitly the Candleſtick lighted, ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting the Temple.</note>
namely, the <hi>Candleſtick,</hi> with all its Lamps ligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
you may aske how this ſhould come to be a
fit Hieroglyphique to betoken this work of fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing
and perfecting the Temple? I anſwer,
thus: The <hi>Candleſtick</hi> was one of the chiefe Uten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſils
and Ornaments of the Temple, and therefore
is ſtill firſt mentioned, as in <hi>Exod.</hi> 25. 31. and in
the 9. to the <hi>Heb. ver.</hi> 2. where all the ſacred hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhold
ſtuffe of the Inner Temple are ſpecified, the
<hi>Candleſtick</hi> as being chiefe is ranked firſt, <hi>[where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
was the Candleſtick, and the Table, and the Shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bread;]</hi>
and therefore is here moſt aptly put for
the bringing in all the reſt into the Temple; and
of all thoſe other beſt and aptlieſt ſerved to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent
the finiſhing thereof: for whilſt the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
remained uncovered with a roofe, there was
no bringing in the Candleſtick, as lighted; and
till then there needed no light to be brought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
it, it being <hi>ſub dio,</hi> under open ayre: But
when the Houſe it ſelfe ſhould once be reared, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:111727:7"/>
to the patterne, without the Candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick
and its light, it would have beene full of
darkneſſe, (as ſome affirme, which I will not
now diſpute:) For however, the bringing in the
Candleſtick argued not onely the compleatneſſe
of the edifice, and building it ſelfe, but alſo by a
Synecdoche, the introducing all ſorts of ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
that were appointed for the adorning of it.
An <hi>Altar</hi> would not ſo evidently or neceſſarily
have ſuppoſed the Temple perfected; for <hi>Ezra</hi> 3.
3. an Altar was ſet up, <hi>when yet not ſo much as the
foundation of the Temple was laid, ver.</hi> 6. But a <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dleſtick,</hi>
and that lighted too, ſuppoſes the houſe
built and compleatly furniſhed. And therefore
under the Goſpel their whole Church ſtate, and
that as in the Primitive times, under their full
perfection, is ſet forth by <hi>ſeven golden candleſticks,</hi>
ſo <hi>Revel.</hi> 1. 13. which <hi>ver. ult.</hi> are interpreted to
be the ſeven Churches of Aſia. The difference is,
that here is but <hi>one</hi> candleſtick, becauſe the
Church of the Jews was nationall, and but one;
but there are <hi>ſeven,</hi> for the Churches under the
Goſpel are many.</p>
            <p>And for that other part of the Viſion,<note place="margin">How fitly the Elders and the Prieſts are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled by two Olive trees.</note> the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenting
<hi>Zerubbabel</hi> and <hi>Jeſhua</hi> by <hi>two Olive trees,</hi>
and thoſe planted in Gods Court, ſo neere the
Candleſtick, is no new or ſtrange thing: For
<hi>David</hi> being the Ruler of the Jews, and a nurſing
Father to the Church, compares himſelfe to a
<hi>greene Olive tree in the houſe of God, Pſal.</hi> 52. 8. and
the pillars of the doores of the Temple, and the
Cherubims therein being made of that wood.
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:111727:8"/>
The alluſion is leſſe remote. And theſe emptyed
<hi>golden oyle,</hi> that is, their eſtates and paines for the
finiſhing this coſtly work; and likewiſe becauſe it
was done in ſincerity of heart, therefore it is called
<hi>golden,</hi> or <hi>pure</hi> oyle. And further, ſeeing it was
made the duty of every Jew <hi>to bring pure oyle olive
beaten, to cauſe the lamps to burn continually,</hi> as <hi>Lev.</hi>
24. 2. hence therefore to compare the eminent
perſons, the Magiſtrates and Prieſts of that
Church, to Olive trees themſelves, that for the
firſt lighting of the candleſtick did naturally
afford it, was every way moſt elegant. And they
are called <hi>ſons of oyle, ver.</hi> 14. as being fruitfull,
and affording plenty of it. Thus <hi>Eſay</hi> 5. 1. a
<hi>fruitfull hill,</hi> and a fertile ſoile, is in the Originall
(as here) called <hi>A ſon of oyle.</hi> And thus much for
the <hi>Viſion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now for the <hi>interpretation</hi> of it in the words of
the Text;<note place="margin">In <hi>the interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation</hi> of the Viſion, three things.</note> as it explaines the mind of the Viſion,
ſo it addes all encouragements unto them, to
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> ſet upon this work: Firſt, by aſſuring them that
<hi>that mountaine</hi> of oppoſition (which you heard in
the ſtory was raiſed up againſt it) ſhould be <hi>made
a plaine</hi> before them: namely, that <hi>Samaritan fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi>
which was backt by many of the <hi>people of the
land,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Samari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, why called a Mountain.</note> 
               <hi>Ezra</hi> 4. 4. A <hi>Mountaine</hi> is a ſimilitude frequent
in Scripture, to note out high and potent oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
lying in the way of Gods proceedings. <hi>Prepare
ye the way of the Lord; every mountaine ſhall be brought
low, Luke</hi> 3. 5. And ſo the Poets doe expreſſe their
fained war of the Giants againſt the Gods, by
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:111727:8"/>
heaping up mountaine upon mountaine.</p>
            <p>And ſecondly, whereas their doubting hearts <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
might aske, How this was poſſible, it being
ſo great, and ſo rooted a mountaine, with
ſuch foundations; where are the ſpades, the
meanes that ſhould remove it? The Angel an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers,
<hi>Not by might,</hi> (or, as in the Originall, <hi>an
Army</hi> or <hi>multitude) nor by power,</hi> (of authority) that
was in any humane fore-ſight as yet like to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
it) <hi>but by my Spirit;</hi> and he that <hi>ſayes</hi> it, is
<hi>the Lord of Hoaſts.</hi>
               <note place="margin">What by Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</note> By his <hi>Spirit,</hi> meaning both the
holy Ghoſt, enclining and ſtrengthening their
hearts, yea turning thoſe of their oppoſites there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto:
And by <hi>Spirit</hi> alſo meaning many concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
acts of Providence, which ſhould fall in to
the effecting of it: For there is ſaid to be a <hi>ſpirit
of life in the wheeles</hi> of Providence, which moves
them, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 1. 20. Not but that God did uſe the
power and authority of the Perſian Monarchy;
for <hi>Ezra 6. 8. Darius</hi> reverſt the former Decree,
and made a new one for the building of the
houſe. But becauſe that God by his Spirit and
owne immediate hand brought about the power
of that State to countenance it: Therefore it is
ſaid to be <hi>not by power,</hi> but <hi>by the Spirit;</hi> and for
this he uſed not an <hi>Armie,</hi> as it is in the margent;
there was no ſword drawne, the ſtate ſtood as it
did, but <hi>[by my Sprit] ſayes the Lord of Hoſts;</hi> that
ſo it might appeare, that although <hi>Zerubbabels</hi>
hand was in it, yet that God would bring it ſo
to paſſe, that nothing ſhould be aſcribed to them,
but the glory of all unto God himſelfe.</p>
            <p>

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Which is the third thing in this ſpeech of the
Angel here; that when the houſe ſhould be fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed,
ſignified by <hi>Zerubbabels</hi> bringing forth the
<hi>head ſtone</hi> thereof, (as Maſter builders uſe to doe
the firſt and laſt ſtone) they ſhould with many
<hi>ſhoutings</hi> and acclamations of joy, <hi>cry, Grace, Grace

            <div type="part">
               <head>
                  <hi>Thus much for the Expoſition of the words: I ſhall
now raiſe ſome Obſervations out of them.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>Out of the recited ſtorie, and what is here
ſaid in the 9. <hi>verſe,</hi> which doth put <hi>Jeſhua</hi> upon
<hi>finiſhing the Temple;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Obſer.</note> The firſt Obſervation is this,
<hi>That God carryes on the building of the ſecond Temple
after the comming out of Babylon,</hi> (which was a
type of the Reformation of our Churches) <hi>not
all at once, but by degrees.</hi> The firſt Temple un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Old Teſtament was at once erected per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
ſo by <hi>Solomon;</hi> And the Tabernacle before
him, by <hi>Moſes,</hi> was quickly finiſhed, according to
the patterne of the Mount, <hi>Exod.</hi> 40. 43. but this
ſecond Temple after the Captivity received de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
of rearing of it. And thus in the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament,
thoſe Primitive Churches were ſet up
perfect (as for matter of rules) by the holy Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles.
And ſo it was meet they ſhould be, becauſe
the Patterne was but <hi>once to be given,</hi> in the model
of them. But Antichriſtianiſme having laid that
Temple deſolate, and defiled Gods worſhip in
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:111727:9"/>
all the parts of it; and thoſe Ages wherein it
ſhould be reſtored, wanting Apoſtles immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
inſpired, hence the reſtauration of them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
a work of time: The holy Ghoſt Age af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Age gradually revealing pieces of the plat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
of it; the <hi>Spirit</hi> by degrees <hi>conſuming</hi> and
dispelling the darkneſſe that Antichriſtianiſme
had brought in, by light ſhining clearer and clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer
to the perfect day, which is the <hi>brightneſſe
of Chriſts comming,</hi> as 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2. 8. Compare we

               <p>Theſe Jews when firſt they were come out of
Babylon, and gathered to Mount Sion, (which
was holy ground, where they might ſacrifice)
they erected an Altar onely, <hi>Ezra</hi> 3. and that in

as in the law of <hi>Moſes</hi> direction was given, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Tabernacle was reared; and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly
of this here it is ſaid, <hi>[As it is written
in the law of Moſes,] ver.</hi> 2. They now began
the world, anew, and offered burnt Sacrifices
upon Mount Sion, kept a few Feaſts; <hi>But</hi> (ſayes
the 6. <hi>ver.) the foundation of the Temple was not yet
laid:</hi> Then in the 8. <hi>ver.</hi> it is ſaid, that the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of the Temple <hi>was laid,</hi> but left imperfect:
But many yeares after, and after the ſucceſſion of
two or three Kings, the Temple is ſaid to be <hi>finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,

                  <pb n="14" facs="tcp:111727:10"/>
Come we now to the Antitype, the times of
Reformation from under Popery: In the ſtory
of which like graduall proceedings might eaſily be
obſerved out of Eccleſiaſticall ſtory, if it would
not be too long to make ſuch narrations: I will ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
take it as it is briefly &amp; at once preſented by
the holy Ghoſt himſelfe in that great Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
of the New Teſtament, and the ſuccee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
times therof, the Booke of the <hi>Revelation.</hi>
In the 13. <hi>Chapter</hi> throughout, you have the
Beaſt of Rome in one entire view preſented
in his height, and as poſſeſſing all the Euro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pean
world as worſhippers of him: And then
in the 14. and following Chapters you oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitely
have Chriſt and thoſe that followed him, &amp;
the ſtory of their ſeparation from, and the ſeverall
degrees of winning ground upon that Beaſt, in the
like entire view laid forth before you. In the 1. <hi>v.</hi>
the <hi>Lambe</hi> appeares with his <hi>company</hi> nakedly ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
upon <hi>Mount Sion,</hi> without the mention of any
Temple as yet built ore their heads, even ſuch as
theſe Jewes condition was when they came
firſt to Sion. Some Ordinances they had; they
<hi>harping with their harps, ver.</hi> 2. and <hi>ſung as it were
a new ſong,</hi> uttering ſomething differing from
the doctrine of thoſe times, but ſo confuſedly, as
<hi>no man could learne that ſong, v.</hi> 3. &amp; they in a great
part kept themſelves <hi>virgins,</hi> and from being <hi>defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led</hi>
with the fornications of the whore: And theſe
are ſaid to be <hi>the firſt-fruits</hi> to God, <hi>ver.</hi> 4. that is,
the firſt beginnings of a diſlike of Popery. But
then by degrees the Lamb ſends out three Angels,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:111727:10"/>
to make a more open ſeparation from Rome; the
later of which riſes ſtill higher then the former.
The firſt, <hi>ver.</hi> 6. onely <hi>preacheth the everlaſting Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel,</hi>
that is, ſalvation by Chriſt alone, and calleth
upon men to <hi>feare</hi> and <hi>worſhip God alone who made
heaven and earth,</hi> and not to worſhip Saints and
Angels: (thus the <hi>Waldenſes</hi> did.) But then <hi>ver.</hi> 8.
an Age or two after that, there follow others
who proclaime with open mouth, and tell Rome
to her face that ſhe is the whore of Babylon:
(thus <hi>Wickliff</hi> and <hi>Hus.)</hi> And then <hi>ver.</hi> 9. after
theſe follows a third Angel, who proceeds fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and preaches that all thoſe that will cleave
unto her doctrine and ſuperſtitions, <hi>ſhall drink of
the wrath of God for ever:</hi> and ſo urge a ſeparation
from her, upon paine of damnation. And then at
the 14. <hi>ver.</hi> you have the Son of man <hi>crowned,</hi>
the Lambe having overcome the Kings, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe
and countenance the Proteſtant Religion
with their authority: And then <hi>ver.</hi> 15. you have
mention of a <hi>Temple,</hi> Churches being in all theſe
Northerne parts publiquely erected by their al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance
and commandement; as the Jewes did
build the Temple by the Decree of <hi>Cyrus.</hi> And
<hi>Chap.</hi> 15. the pourers out of the vials doe come
all forth of the Temple, <hi>ver.</hi> 6. And if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult
the 11. <hi>Cap.</hi> (the maine occurrences of which
are evidently contemporary, and doe ſumme up
the ſtory of the ſame time with the Vials, as by
comparing the one with the other, late Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
have obſerved. This Book running over two
entire Prophecies of all times, (each of them)
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:111727:11"/>
whereof the firſt ends at the end of <hi>Cha.</hi> 11.) Now
in that Chapter (which therefore containes the
ſtory of the laſt times) there are three editions
of that Temple plainly intimated. The firſt, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
to be already ſtanding when the Viſion is
given; but imperfect in this, that it hath too great
an <hi>outward Court</hi> of an ignorant and profane
multitude laid to it. And therefore <hi>John,</hi> bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the perſon of the godly of that age, is ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
up to ſet upon a ſecond Reformation of it,
and is bidden to <hi>meaſure that Temple, Altar, and
worſhippers</hi> anew, and <hi>to caſt out that outward Court</hi>
that had defiled it. And then <hi>ver.</hi> 19. there is a
third edition of an <hi>Holy of Holies,</hi> for therein
<hi>the Arke</hi> is ſaid to be <hi>ſeene;</hi> now the Ark ſtood
onely in the Holy of Holies: noting out a more
perfect Church at laſt then all the former had
beene. A manifeſt alluſion this is unto thoſe
three parts of <hi>Solomons</hi> Temple, the outward
Court, the inward Temple, and the Holy of
Holies.</p>
               <p>Thus much perhaps might more clearly have
been diſcovered in the ſtory of the Reformation;
but I judged it would better and more briefly be
done in this the Prophecie of it.
<hi>Uſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let no Church therefore think it ſelfe perfect,
and <hi>needing nothing,</hi> (as bragging <hi>Laodicea</hi> did)
eſpecially when it hath but that firſt foundation
which it had when it came newly out of Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon;
and more eſpecially in matters of worſhip
and diſcipline. It is no diſhonour unto thoſe
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:111727:11"/>
Reformers, to ſay, that they fully finiſhed not
this work; as it was not unto <hi>Zerubbabel</hi> here,
that hee perfected not the Temple at firſt.
<hi>Bleſſed men!</hi> It is evident they purpoſed more
then they did or could effect, becauſe the <hi>peoples
hearts were not [as yet] prepared,</hi> as the phraſe is,
2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 20. 33. In our very Common-Prayer
book there is an <hi>[Untill] the ſaid diſcipline may be
reſtored,</hi> which argueth they aimed at more. And
beſides, They were not Apoſtles, to <hi>whom nothing
might be added,</hi> as <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 6. And God <hi>raiſing up the
Tabernacle that was falne downe,</hi> not by imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
inſpiration, (as at firſt by the Apoſtles) but
by his Spirit, renewing and begetting light in an
ordinary way: Hence therefore the Churches
comming out of the darkneſſe of Popery, muſt
needs recover that fulneſſe and perfection of
light (which the Apoſtolicall times had) <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
by piece-meals and degrees. As for the great
things of the Goſpel, matters of <hi>Faith,</hi> or Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
they had ſo happy a hand therein, that
there is to be found little, if any <hi>Hay</hi> or <hi>ſtubble</hi>
therein: But in matters of <hi>Order,</hi> which concerne
Worſhip and Diſcipline, (for ſo the Apoſtle di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſheth,
<hi>Coloſ. 2. 5. [Faith and Order]</hi> let it
be enquired into, whether they were ſo exact
therein. Although this muſt be ſaid, that God
did take care for all Fundamentall Ordinances
of his worſhip; and it is a bitter errour, and full
of cruelty, to ſay, Wee have had no Churches,
no Miniſters, no Sacraments, but Antichriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall.
Gods firſt and chiefe care was, to build up
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:111727:12"/>
his Church <hi>myſticall,</hi> to make men Saints, and
he hath made glorious ones in their perſonall
walkings with him: and to that end he made
a plentifull proviſion in matters of faith, even
from the very firſt. It fell out in this caſe, as
in a new Plantation; which if men were to make
in another world, and ſo to begin the world anew,
their firſt care would be to provide neceſſaries
for their ſubſiſtence as they are men; to have corn
for bread, cattle for meat, and the like: But mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of Order &amp; Government they think of after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
and often fall into the right, by ſeeing their
errors by degrees. Think not much therefore, that
men call for (as moſt men doe) a reformation of
ſome things amiſſe in matters of worſhip &amp; diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline,
or an addition of ſome things; perhaps a
Candleſtick, or ſome other utenſil or ordinance
of Church-worſhip is found wanting. You will
wonder, that all along during the raigne of thoſe
good Kings, both <hi>David, Solomon,</hi> (who yet gave
the patterne of, and alſo built the Temple) and
thoſe other Reformers among the Kings of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah,
there ſhould ſomething have been omitted
about the Feaſt of Tabernacles, untill their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
out of the Babyloniſh Captivity: Yet wee
find it was ſo, as appeares by <hi>Nehem.</hi> 8. 16. and 17.
<hi>verſes, The people went forth, and made themſelves
boothes, every one upon the roofe of his houſe, and in
their Courts, and in the Courts of Gods houſe, and in
the ſtreets; [and ſince the dayes of Ieſhua the ſon of Nun,
untill that day, the Children of Iſrael had not done ſo.]</hi>
This feaſt was kept (as is thought) by <hi>Solomon,</hi>
                  <pb n="19" facs="tcp:111727:12"/>
2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 7. 8. and by theſe ſame Jews, <hi>Ezra</hi> 3. 4.
yet not in this manner, according unto the Law,
and therefore at the 14. <hi>ver.</hi> of that of <hi>Nchemiah,</hi>
it is ſaid, <hi>They found it written in the Law, that the
children of Iſrael ſhould dwell in boothes;</hi> which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
that they had not done, although they might
have kept that Feaſt. But now they had learned by
a ſad experience to keepe it aright, with <hi>dwelling
in boothes,</hi> by having been lately <hi>ſtrangers</hi> out of
their owne land; to ſignifie which and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe
themſelves ſtrangers, was the intent of that
Feaſt, and that rite of it, the dwelling in boothes.
And this reaſon is intimated in the 17. <hi>verſe,
All the congregation [that were come againe out of
the Captivity,] made boothes, &amp;c. They did reade
alſo every day out of the Law, ver.</hi> 19. which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
when that Feaſt was celebrated, they had
not done.</p>
               <p>A ſecond Obſervation,<note place="margin">2. Obſer.</note> That <hi>in the greateſt
buſineſſes which moſt concerne the good of Gods
Church, and his own glory, he oft-times ſuffers
Mountains of oppoſition to lye in the way of them:</hi> So
here, in the way to the building and perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his Church. To give another inſtance of it,
and that the higheſt. The Salvation of the
ſons of men, whom he had choſen before all
worlds, is a buſineſſe which of all other he moſt
mindeth and effectually intendeth, but doth he
bring it about without rubs? Never ſuch Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
lay in the way of any buſineſſe. <hi>Adam</hi> he ſins,
and in him, all thoſe whom God meant to ſave,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:111727:13"/>
whereby the way to their ſalvation was quite
blockt up: Mountaines of <hi>Sins</hi> make a <hi>Separation</hi>
betweene him and them, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 59. 2. and not all the
power of men and Angels can any whit move,
much leſſe remove them, no more then ſtrawes
can move a mountain. But then comes the Son of
God, who throwes and <hi>buries</hi> all theſe mountains
<hi>in the bottome of the ſea.</hi> And when Chriſt had
thus removed the guilt of ſinne, and would come
into mens hearts to apply his death, there lie as
high mountains in his way to us, as before lay in
ours unto him. <hi>Luke 3. 5. Prepare ye the way of the
Lord, make his paths ſtraight; [every mountaine ſhall be
brought low.]</hi> There are <hi>high things,</hi> and <hi>ſtrong holds,</hi>
2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 4. that <hi>exalt themſelves againſt the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of Chriſt:</hi> but all theſe ſhall be <hi>brought low,</hi>
and ſhall be <hi>made a plaine.</hi> And as this is found
true in the ſalvation of the Church by Chriſt, ſo
in its preſervation and growth. There is almoſt
no mercy, but ſome mountain or other lies in the
way of it.</p>
               <p>And the reaſon of this diſpenſation of Gods,<note place="margin">Reaſ.</note> is,
both that his hand and <hi>power</hi> in bringing things
to paſſe, for his Church, may be <hi>ſeene</hi> and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged,
and that his <hi>enemies</hi> may be <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded:</hi>
I put both theſe reaſons in one, becauſe
we finde them mentioned together in one place,
<hi>Nehem.</hi> 6. 16. In which Chapter you may reade
of the great oppoſition made in building the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
as here the Temple; which yet when God
had carryed on, <hi>It came to paſſe,</hi> (ſayes that 16.
<hi>ver.) that when all their enemies heard thereof, and all
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:111727:13"/>
that were about them ſaw theſe things, [they wene
much caſt downe in their owne eyes,]</hi> (there is one
part of the reaſon) <hi>for they perceived that [this work
was wrought by our God,]</hi> there is the other part.
Firſt, Gods power appeares, in carrying things <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
through much oppoſition. If there were a full
concurrencie of all ſecond cauſes, and a generall
ſuffrage of them, his voice would then be loſt
and ſwallowed up among that crowd; but when
there is a great canvas, (as in Colledges we call
it) then the power of his caſting voyce appeares.
Thus why is God ſaid to <hi>bring Iſrael out of Egypt
with a ſtrong hand, Exod.</hi> 13. 30. but becauſe it was
carryed on through much oppoſition? There lay
no leſſe then ten mountains in the way of it; <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raohs</hi>
heart was hardned <hi>ten times,</hi> which God did
on purpoſe to ſhew his power, <hi>Exod.</hi> 9. 6. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
he doth it, to confound his enemies the more,
which uſually goes together with doing good
unto his Church: <hi>He renders vengeance to his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries,</hi>
and is <hi>ncercifull to his Land,</hi> both at once,
<hi>Deut.</hi> 32. 43. He often ſuffers them to have the
ball on their foot, till they come to the very
goale, and yet then to miſſe the game: That
ſo <hi>wherein they dealt proudly,</hi> he might <hi>ſhew him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
above them,</hi> which is <hi>Jethroes</hi> reaſon, <hi>Exod.</hi>
18. 9.</p>
               <p>This Obſervation but in generall:<note place="margin">3. Obſer.</note> More par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly,
a third Obſervation is this: <hi>That Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple-work
eſpecially uſeth to meet with oppoſition.</hi> You
ſhall finde the building and the finiſhing of this
Temple in all the degrees of it, to have had many
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:111727:14"/>
contentions againſt it, all along accompanying it.
Thus, when firſt that Altar was ſet up, <hi>Ezra</hi>
3. 3. it is ſaid, that <hi>feare was upon them, becauſe of
the people of thoſe countryes.</hi> Againe, when the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
was laid, what interruption that met with,
you heard before, out of the 4. <hi>Chapter.</hi> And laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
when they came to finiſh it, <hi>Chap.</hi> 5. 2. at <hi>ver.</hi> 3.
their enemies came and queſtioned them for it,
<hi>Who hath commanded you to build this houſe? &amp;c.</hi>
and the devill was in it, in a pure oppoſition to the
Temple; for they had ſuffered them to build
their owne houſes, as appears <hi>Hag.</hi> 2. 4. and never
ſtirred againſt them; but onely now when they
began to build the Temple. Thus in the New
Teſtament, <hi>[Aedificabo Eccleſiam,] [I will build my
Church,]</hi> hath and will alwayes have the <hi>gates</hi>
(or the power) <hi>of hell</hi> following it to oppoſe it.
I could demonſtrate it all along out of that ſtory
alſo; but it would be too long.</p>
               <p>The Reaſons of it are,</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">Reaſ. 1.</note> there is nothing more contrary to Satan,
then the ſetting up of Gods worſhip, and the puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
and compleating of it. And therefore whilſt
the devill is god of this world, and hath any pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
therein, he will be ſure to raiſe a head againſt
that of all things elſe. So far as there are any aber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
in worſhip, Satan is ſet up: And ſo far as
the worſhip of God is perfected, God is ſet up,
and Satan <hi>falls as lightning, Revel.</hi> 3. 9. falſe wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippers
are called the <hi>Synagogue of Satan.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Reaſ. 2.</note> there is nothing more contrary to
fleſh and bloud. When <hi>Paul</hi> came to ſet up Euan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelicall
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:111727:14"/>
and Spirituall worſhip, (which is called
a <hi>Reformation, Heb.</hi> 9. 10.) he met with oppoſition
every where; and that from ſuch who were wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippers
alſo. There is a naturall and blind devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in men, that is moſt oppoſite to ſpirituall
worſhip. Therefore <hi>Acts 13. 15. [Devout] women
raiſed up a perſecution</hi> againſt <hi>Paul.</hi> And men are
addicted to their old Cuſtomes, and what they
were brought up in. Thus it is ſaid of the Jews,
though godly, that many thouſands of them op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
<hi>Paul,</hi> out of their zeale to the Law they
were brought up in. <hi>Acts 21. 20. Many thouſands
of the Jews which beleeve, are all Zealous of the Law:</hi>
And thereupon at <hi>ver.</hi> 27. we reade that they ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
up the people, crying out, <hi>ver. 28. Men of
Iſrael, help; This is the man that teacheth every where
againſt the people, and this place,</hi> (namely, the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
and the Ceremoniall worſhip of it.)</p>
               <p>The Uſe of both theſe Points together,<note place="margin">Uſe.</note> is, Not
to be diſcouraged in, or think the worſe of any
buſineſſe that is for God, becauſe of difficulties
and interruptions. In the 4. of <hi>Nehem.</hi> when the
Jews went to build the walls of the City, the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
mockt them, and ſaid, <hi>What will theſe feeble
Jewes doe?</hi> but ſtill <hi>ver.</hi> 6. the people they went
on, for they <hi>had a mind to work:</hi> which when
their enemies heard of, they then ſet upon them
with open force of armes, <hi>ver.</hi> 8. Yet neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe,
<hi>We</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>made our prayer to God,</hi> and ſet
<hi>a watch day and night;</hi> they doubled their care and
paines, and <hi>wrought both night and day,</hi> and <hi>did not
put off their clothes, ver.</hi> 21. And when <hi>Nehemiah</hi>
                  <pb n="24" facs="tcp:111727:15"/>
heard that the enemy threatned to kill him, on
purpoſe to diſhearten him) yet <hi>Chap.</hi> 6. he would
not <hi>flee, ver.</hi> 11. neither was he at all diſheartned,
as knowing it was <hi>a ſin to be afraid, ver.</hi> 13.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>There is no mountaine of oppoſition ſo great,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">4. Obſer.</note> 
                  <hi>that
can ſtand before Zerubbabel, (or Gods people) eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
when he goes about to finiſh the Temple.</hi> (I might
have made two Obſervations of it, but I put them
both together.) You ſee how contemptuouſly he
here ſpeaks, of the oppoſition made; <hi>[Who art
thou, O great mountaine?]</hi> though <hi>great</hi> in their
owne eyes, yet as nothing in his: He ſpeaks as a
Giant unto a Pigmee, <hi>Who art thou?</hi> I will name
one place more, ſuitable to this alluſion, <hi>Eſay</hi> 41.
14, 15. <hi>Feare not, thou worme Jacob: I will help thee,
ſaith the Lord. Behold, I will make thee a new ſharp
threſhing inſtrument having teeth: thou ſhalt threſh
[the mountaines,] and beat them ſmall, and thou ſhalt
make the hils as chaffe.</hi> He ſuppoſeth in theſe his
expreſſions, the Church to be in the loweſt, wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keſt,
and moſt contemptible condition that might
be; a <hi>[worme]</hi> which no man feares, for it cannot
doe the leaſt hurt, and which no man loves; yea,
thinks it no cruelty or oppreſſion to tread upon,
and kill. On the other ſide, he ſpeaks of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
all that might argue greatneſſe, ſtrength,
and exaltation: he calls them <hi>[Mountaines,]</hi> and
<hi>[Hils:]</hi> And what an unequall match is this, for
Wormes to be ſet upon Mountaines to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
them? Yet, ſayes God, <hi>I will take this
worme,</hi> (for it muſt be his power muſt doe it) and
<hi>make it as a new ſharp threſhing inſtrument with
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:111727:15"/>
teeth,</hi> (with which kind of inſtrument thoſe Eaſtern
Countries did uſe to maſh in pieces their rougher
and harder fodder for their cattle) <hi>which ſhall threſh
theſe mountains even as ſmall as chaffe,</hi> which is <hi>ſcatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
with the wind,</hi> as <hi>ver.</hi> 16. This is the Metaphor;
the plaine ſong you have in the 11. and 12. <hi>verſes,
Behold, all they that are incenſt againſt thee ſhall periſh,
and thoſe that contended with thee, be as a thing of
nought.</hi> But this is eſpecially found true when
Gods people goe about to build the Temple; no
mountaine then can ſtand to hinder them: There
ſtood in the way of laying the foundation of
this Temple, the greateſt mountaine that was
then (and well-night that hath been ſince) up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the earth, the Babyloniſh Monarchy; by
the power of which theſe Jews were detained
captives, and they would never have let them
goe: And therefore <hi>Eſay</hi> 57. 14. this phraſe is
uſed, <hi>Caſt ye up, caſt ye up, take the ſtumbling block
out of the way of my people.</hi> And more expreſly, <hi>Jer.</hi>
51. 25. the Prophet calls Babel a <hi>deſtroying moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,
I am againſt thee, oh deſtroying mountaine:</hi>
and for ſtrength of ſcituation he compares it to a
mountaine <hi>ſeated upon a rock,</hi> which is a farther ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of ſortification to it. Yet ſayes God, <hi>I will
ſtretch out my hand upon thee, and rowle thee downe
from the rocks, and make thee a burnt mountaine, ſo
as they ſhall not take from thee a ſtone for a corner, or
for foundations: ver.</hi> 26. Whereas thou didſt
unbuild Hieruſalem and my Temple, I will un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>build
thee, ſo as not ſomuch as a ſtone of thee ſhall
ſerve for any other building, but my Sion ſhall
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:111727:16"/>
be built again. For to what end was this moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
thus removed? even that poore Hieruſalem
and Gods Temple there might bee built againe.
Thus <hi>Iſai.</hi> 44. laſt, and the 45. 1. and 2. <hi>verſes</hi>
compared, <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord of Cyrus, He is my
ſhepheard, and ſhall performe all my pleaſure; even ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to Jeruſalem, Thou ſhalt be built, and to the Temple,
Thy foundation ſhall be laid. Cyrus</hi> and his Armie
were the workmen whom God hired to <hi>caſt up</hi> (as
<hi>Eſays</hi> phraſe is) or <hi>throw down</hi> (as <hi>Jeremies)</hi> this rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſh
that lay in his peoples way, &amp; of their buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
this Temple. And all the victories that <hi>Cyrus</hi>
obtained, and <hi>hidden treaſures</hi> that through ſpoiles
he acquired, were all that <hi>Jeruſalem might be built:</hi>
So it follows in the 45. <hi>Chap.</hi> 1, 2, 3, and 4. <hi>verſes,</hi>
and ſo on, <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord to Cyrus, whoſe right
hand I have ſtrengthened to ſubdue Nations before me,
and I will looſe the loines of Kings:</hi> Hee was to
overcome other Nations and Kings, before he
could come at Babylon: as <hi>Croeſus,</hi> that rich
King of Lydia, &amp;c. And God threw down all afore
him. <hi>I will goe before thee; I will break in pieces the
gates of braſſe, and cut in ſunder the bars of iron,</hi> (all
difficulties flew ope, and nothing could ſtand in
his way) <hi>and I will give thee the treaſures of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
the hidden riches of ſecret places.</hi> And why
did God doe all this for him? <hi>For Jacob my
ſervants ſake, and Iſrael mine elect.</hi> For (otherwiſe)
ſayes God of this <hi>Cyrus) thou haſt not known me,</hi> ſo
<hi>ver.</hi> 4. All this which God did for him, was, that he
might <hi>performe Gods pleaſure, ſaying to Jeruſalem,
Be built, and to the Temple, Thy foundation ſhall be
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:111727:16"/>
laid,</hi> as you had it out of the laſt <hi>ver.</hi> of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going
<hi>Chapter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And then again, when the foundation thereof
was thus happily laid, there ſtood (as you ſee in the
Text) another <hi>Mountaine</hi> in the way to the finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and perfecting of it, namely, this Sama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritan
Faction, who gained the power of that
Perſian Monarchy to be againſt it: (of which
Mountain the Prophet here in like manner ſayes,
that it <hi>ſhould be made a Plaine.)</hi> And if the Perſian
Monarch <hi>Dartus</hi> had not come off too as he did,
<hi>EZra</hi> 6. from the 1. <hi>ver.</hi> to the end of the <hi>Chap.</hi>
God would have ſerved him, as he had done Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon.
<hi>Be ye wiſe therefore now, O Kings, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed
O ye Judges of the Earth.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Reaſ.</note>
               </p>
               <p>The Reaſon of all this lies but in three words
which God hath ſpoken once, yea twice, <hi>[Aedifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cabo
Eccleſia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> meam] [I will build my Church,]</hi> which
have more force in them, then all the created
power of Heaven, Earth, or Hell. He had ſaid
it in the Old Teſtament (as you heard) <hi>Iſai.</hi> 44. 28.
<hi>ſaying to Hieruſalem, Thou ſhalt be built, and to the
Temple, Thy foundation ſhall be laid.</hi> And Chriſt
ſaid it over again in the New Teſtament, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.
18. <hi>I will build my Church:</hi> He ſpeakes of that
Church under the New Teſtament, which in fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
ages was to come. And what follows?
<hi>[The Gates of Hell ſhall not prevaile againſt it.]</hi> You
heard before in the Old Teſtament, that the <hi>Braſſe
Gates</hi> were <hi>opened</hi> to make way for the building of
that Temple, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 45. 2. But here in the New
Teſtament, there are ſtronger Gates then of
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:111727:17"/>
                  <hi>Braſſe:</hi> here are the Gates of <hi>Hell:</hi> which yet
Chriſt (like another <hi>Sampſon)</hi> flings off their
hinges. As whilſt the Devill is god of the world,
<hi>[Aedificabo Eccleſiam meam]</hi> ſhall be ſure to be hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered,
if he can: ſo whilſt Chriſt is <hi>King</hi> of this
world, and <hi>hath all power committed to him, both in
heaven and earth,</hi> moſt certainly, the Gates of
Hell ſhall never prevaile againſt it. It is this
ſame <hi>[Aedificabo Eccleſiam meam,] [I will build my
Church,]</hi> that hath made all the ſtirre in the
world. I remember in the yeare 1619. or 20.
(or thereabouts) when the Wars in Germany
began, it was reported, that a great Braſſe Image
of the Apoſtle <hi>Peter,</hi> (which had that pretended
claime, by which <hi>Rome</hi> would hold her Keyes,
fairely emboſſed upon a Roll that hung downe
upon the Image, in theſe wordst <hi>[Tu es Petrus,
&amp; ſuper hanc petram aedificabo Eccleſiam: &amp; tibi da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bo
Claves, &amp;c.] [Thou art Peter, and upon this Rock
I will build my Church: and I will give to thee the
Keyes, &amp;c.)</hi> ſtanding (as I take it) in S. <hi>Peters</hi>
Church at <hi>Rome;</hi> there was a great &amp; maſſie ſtone
fell downe upon it, and ſo ſhattered it to pieces,
that not a letter of all that ſentence (whereon <hi>Rome</hi>
founds her claime) was left whole, ſo as to be
read, ſaving this one piece of that ſentence,
<hi>[aedificabo Eccleſiam meam] [I will build my Church,]</hi>
which was left faire and entire.</p>
               <p>That Promiſe <hi>[I will build my Church]</hi> is the
<hi>Magna Charta,</hi> yea, the <hi>Prima Charta,</hi> the Great
and Firſt Charter of the Saints in the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament;
thoſe words in the 16. of <hi>Mat.</hi> being the
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:111727:17"/>
firſt that Chriſt uttered about it; and ſo, contain
within them, all leſſer Promiſes of all ſorts, that
follow, that concerne the building of his Church,
or any piece of it. Now all that concerne the
Building of his Church, are reducible unto theſe
two heads: Firſt, the preſervation and enlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
of his <hi>Church Myſticall,</hi> and of his Saints on
earth; and thus conſidering them perſonally, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
they ſhould be ſcattered each from other:
or ſecondly, the Building up his Church, as ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
in Aſſemblies to hold forth his publique
worſhip in the world, as that place forementio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
is apparently to be underſtood by the next
words: For he ſpeakes of the <hi>Keyes</hi> in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
<hi>verſe;</hi> whereby are meant all <hi>Media cultus,</hi>
all Ordinances of worſhip, whereby his Church
is built. So then this Reaſon taken from <hi>[aedifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cabo
Eccleſiam]</hi> branches it ſelfe into two Parts;<note place="margin">Two Branches of this reaſon:</note>
The firſt is taken from his love to his Church
Myſticall, on his Saints ſimply conſidered as ſuch:
The ſecond is from his intereſt in his owne wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip:
for which he loves his Churches that are
the Seat of it, more then all the world.</p>
               <p>1.<note place="margin">1. His love to his Saints.</note> His Love to his Church Myſticall is ſuch,
that no Mountain of oppoſition can ſtand before

This Reaſon you have <hi>Iſai. 43. 3, 4. I gave Egypt for
thy ranſome, Ethiopia and Seba for thee, ſince thou waſt
precious in my ſight, thou haſt been honourable, [and I
have loved thee:] therefore will I give Men for thee,
and People for thy life.</hi> It is put upon this Reaſon,
<hi>Quia amavi te, becauſe I have loved thee;</hi> and that,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:111727:18"/>
more then all the world. Or if you will have it
expreſt in the language of this ſimilitude here in
the Text, <hi>Mountains ſhall depart, and Hills be remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
but my kindneſſe ſhall not depart from thee,</hi>
ſayes God, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 54. 10. It is ſuch a kind of ſpeech
as that of Chriſts: <hi>Heaven and earth ſhall paſſe away,
but not a tittle of my word, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2.<note place="margin">2. Gods love to his worſhip.</note> His love to his Churches holding forth his
Name and worſhip in the world, is ſuch, as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
ſhall withſtand the repairing and perfecting
of them, and of that his worſhip and every parcell
of it. If God had not ſuch Aſſemblies in the
world, he ſhould have no worſhip. Therefore
theſe Churches are called the <hi>Ground and Pillar of
Truth,</hi> both where it growes, and where it is held
forth; 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 15. he there ſpeakes of Church
aſſemblies, as wherein <hi>Timothy</hi> was to learne how
as an Euangeliſt to behave himſelfe, in the orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
and governing of them, as you have it in the

                     </gap> thou mighteſt

And the truth is, that <hi>that</hi> building of the Houſe of
God, of which only <hi>Zachary</hi> here gives us occaſion
to ſpeak, was but the compleating all the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances
of worſhip. It was not ſo much the buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
up the Nation of the Jews that was here di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
intended; but the building of their Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
the ſeat of worſhip, and introducing the Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dleſtick,
&amp;c. And their Aſſemblings there to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
according to Gods owne preſcription, was
more to him, and is ſo ſtill, then what ever elſe
was or is done in the world. In the 87. <hi>Pſal. ver.</hi> 2.
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:111727:18"/>
                  <hi>The Lord loves the gates of Sion more then all the
dwellings of Jacob. The gates of Sion</hi> were the gates
of the Temple that ſtood upon mount Sion, ſet
open for the Jews to worſhip in; and theſe he
loves more then other Societies, or Aſſemblings,
though of <hi>Jacob,</hi> and this more then them <hi>All,</hi> take
them all together; whether civill in their Cities
and families, or religious in their Synagogues;
where they were capable but of ſome few, not of
all the Ordinances that were in the Temple.</p>
               <p>And the reaſon of this his love is,<note place="margin">How much Gods glory is concerned in ſetting right his publique worſhip, and the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his Church.</note> the great
concernment that his publique worſhip is of unto
him. God hath but three things deare unto him
in this world, his <hi>Saints,</hi> his <hi>Worſhip,</hi> and his
<hi>Truth;</hi> and it is hard to ſay, which of theſe is
deareſt unto him; they are <hi>mutuò ſibi fines.</hi> God
therefore ordained Saints to be in the world, that
he might be worſhipt; and reciprocally appointed
theſe Ordinances of worſhip as meanes to build
up his Saints. In the Commandements (the
Epitome of the Old Teſtament) the inſtitutions
of Gods worſhip have the ſecond place: The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Commandment is wholly ſpent thereon; and
therein how <hi>jealous</hi> doth God profeſſe himſelfe of
any aberration or ſwerving from his own rules?
now jealouſie (you know) proceeds from the
deepeſt love. Yea the third and fourth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements
are taken up about it alſo; the one
about the <hi>manner,</hi> that <hi>his Name</hi> (for ſo his wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
is called, <hi>Micah</hi> 4. the 5. <hi>ver.</hi> compared with
<hi>ver.</hi> 2. and 3.) <hi>might not be taken in vaine;</hi> the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
about the <hi>time.</hi> And then in the Lords Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:111727:19"/>
(which is the Epitome of the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment)
in the ſecond Petition (if not the firſt) the
worſhip and government of his Church comes in;
for his Worſhip is his <hi>Name,</hi> (as was ſaid) and we
deſire that to be <hi>Hallowed:</hi> &amp; nothing is more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
Chriſts viſible <hi>Kingdome</hi> here, then the right
adminiſtration of Ordinances in his Church, which
doe ſet him up as <hi>King</hi> of Saints. To this purpoſe
I ſhall open that in the 15. of the <hi>Revelation,</hi> where
when the Saints had got a Temple over their
heads, <hi>ver.</hi> 6. (as was before hinted) then they
call for a true and right worſhipping of Chriſt,
and this becauſe he was <hi>King of Saints:</hi> They ſing,
<hi>Great and marvellous are thy works, Lord God Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
juſt and true are thy wayes, thou King of Saints.
Who ſhall not feare thee, O Lord, and glorifie thy
Name? for thou onely art holy: and all nations ſhall
come and worſhip before thee, &amp;c.</hi> There are three
paires, or <hi>conjugata,</hi> which harmoniouſly anſwer
one to another: Firſt, here is a double title and
Kingdome given unto Chriſt, <hi rend="sup">1</hi>
                  <hi>[Lord Almighty,]</hi>
                  <hi rend="sup">2</hi>
                  <hi>[King of Saints:]</hi> or (if you will) <hi>He is King of
Nations,</hi> and <hi>King of Saints:</hi> 
                  <hi rend="sup">1</hi> King of Nations,
for ſo in that parallel place, <hi>Jerem.</hi> 10. 7. (from
whence theſe words here uttered are evidently
taken, and therefore it is quoted in the margent) he
is called; &amp; ſo is all one with that expreſſion here,
<hi>[Lord God Almighty,]</hi> unto which <hi rend="sup">2</hi> they adde this
other, <hi>Thou King of Saints:</hi> And ſo theſe two are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct,
and both His titles. Then ſecondly, here is a
double duty ſutably due unto him according to
theſe his titles, to <hi>fear</hi> him, and to <hi>worſhip</hi> him, both
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:111727:19"/>
which are expreſſed by this generall, to <hi>glorifie his
Name.</hi> Thirdly, here is a double declaration of the
juſtneſſe of theſe titles, &amp; the ground that calls for
both theſe duties, his <hi>great and marvellous works</hi> in
the world declaring him to be <hi>Lord God Almighty,</hi>
or <hi>King of Nations,</hi> and therefore <hi>Feare</hi> is due un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him, (and accordingly in <hi>Jeremy</hi> we onely read,
<hi>Who would not feare thee, O King of Nations?)</hi> and
then there are his <hi>juſt and true wayes,</hi> declaring him
to be <hi>King of Saints,</hi> (which theſe here in their
ſong adde unto that of <hi>Jeremy)</hi> and this calls for
<hi>Worſhip</hi> from us unto him: <hi>Who ſhall not worſhip
thee, O King of Saints? for true and righteous are thy
wayes and judgements.</hi> In fine, here is Chriſts ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacie
acknowledged both in matters <hi>Civill</hi>
and <hi>Eccleſiaſticall,</hi> in his government of the
<hi>world,</hi> and of his <hi>Church.</hi> And as he is knowne
to be <hi>King of Nations</hi> by his works of Providence
abroad in the world, ſo <hi>to be King of Saints,</hi> by
thoſe <hi>true</hi> and <hi>righteous wayes</hi> wherein his Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
are to walk. And a parallel place unto this
latter, (as that of <hi>Jeremy</hi> was unto the former)
is that in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 68. 24. where the Pſalmiſt ſpeaking
of this worſhip of Chriſt, ſayes, <hi>They have ſeene
thy goings, O God, even the [goings] of my [King]
in the [Sanctuary.]</hi> Mark it; the goings he ſpeaks
of are reſtrained to his <hi>goings in the Sanctuary;</hi> and
ſpoken of him alſo as the Churches <hi>King, [My
King.]</hi> And ſo the words are the very ſame in
ſenſe, that they in the <hi>Temple</hi> here doe utter, <hi>[Juſt
and true are thy wayes, thou King of Saints.]</hi> And
the Pſalmiſt evidently ſpeaks of his waies of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:111727:20"/>
in the Church, as appeares by the very next
words, <hi>ver. 25. The ſingers went before, the players
on inſtruments followed after, &amp;c.</hi> expreſſing the
worſhip of him in his Church in the language of
the Old Teſtament, and he as their King in the
midſt of them, going in his greateſt ſtate. And
yet more clearly, <hi>ver. 26. Bleſſe ye God in the
congregations.</hi> Yea and all this proves to be
New Teſtament too, and a prophecie thereof,
though uttered in the phraſe of and in a prophecy
of the Old. For what is ſaid in the 18. <hi>ver.</hi> before
of this their King, is by the Apoſtle in <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. 8.
applyed unto Chriſts Aſcenſion: <hi>Thou haſt Aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
up on high, thou haſt led Captivity captive, and haſt
received gifts for men,</hi> namely, the gifts for build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of his Church, and directing of his worſhip un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the New Teſtament, as it is expounded by the
Apoſtle in the following <hi>verſes.</hi> And therefore
that which I have even now cited out of that <hi>Pſal.
ver.</hi> 24, 25, 26, &amp;c. is to be underſtood as meant
of the worſhip of the Goſpell in the congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
thereof, erected after Chriſts Aſcenſion. I
ſhall adde but this, Theſe waies are called <hi>juſt</hi> and
<hi>true,</hi> in oppoſition to wayes invented by men,
which on the contrary are <hi>unrighteous</hi> and <hi>falſe;
Pſal. 119. 104. Through thy precepts I get underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
therefore I hate every falſe way.</hi> There is
certainly a <hi>right</hi> Rule, or <hi>way</hi> chalked out for eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
adminiſtration in Gods Sanctuary, if we could
finde it out.</p>
               <p>To illuſtrate all this by a ſimilitude from other
Kings. Two thinges manifeſt a King to be a
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:111727:20"/>
King, &amp; ſhew forth the glory of his Majeſty: 1. His
power and rule abroad throughout all his Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions:
2. The obſervance, the worſhip, and State
ceremonies that are at Court; and theſe ſhew him
to be King as much as the former. This we may
ſee in <hi>Solomon,</hi> whoſe Royalty and Majeſty was
held forth thereby, as much as by his power,
2 <hi>Chron. 9. 4. When the Queene of Sheba had ſeene
the houſe that he had built, the meate of his Table,
the attendance of his Miniſters, and their apparel, and
his aſcent by which he went up into the houſe of the
Lord,</hi> it was ſaid, <hi>there was no more ſpirit in her.</hi> And
in the 17. &amp; 19. <hi>verſes, He made a Throne for the
glory of his Majeſty, the like whereof was not made in
any Kingdome.</hi> Now Chriſts Court on earth
are his Churches, which are called <hi>Gods Houſe,
Heb.</hi> 10. 21. and 25. compared. And there his
throne is ſet up, as in the Temple of old. In all the
Viſions of God, as ſitting on a throne made unto
the Prophets, that throne is preſented as in the
Temple: So <hi>Eſay 6. 1. I ſaw the Lord ſitting upon a
Throne, high and lifted up, and his traine filled the
Temple.</hi> The Temple was therefore called the
<hi>place where Gods honour dwels, Pſal.</hi> 26. 8. that is,
his Court: as ſome of our Kings houſes are called
<hi>Honours.</hi> And thus in the New Teſtament, in the
repreſentation of the Church on earth as wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping
him, <hi>Rev.</hi> 4. 8, 9, and 10. <hi>verſes:</hi> This
Church hath a Throne in the midſt of it, and God
ſits thereon, <hi>ver.</hi> 5, 6, 7. So that indeed, there is
nothing doth more exalt and glorifie God then his
publique worſhip, and the government of his
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:111727:21"/>
Church purely and rightly adminiſtred. 1 <hi>Chron.</hi>
16. 29. <hi>Give unto the Lord the [glory] due unto his
Name, [worſhip] the Lord in the beauty of holineſſe.</hi>
Theſe two are joyned together. (The like you
have <hi>Pſal.</hi> 29. 2.) And it is part of that ſong
which <hi>David</hi> made when he brought back the
Arke, and ſo ſet up Gods worſhip. And fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
in <hi>Eſay</hi> 60. 7. it is called the <hi>houſe of his
glory;</hi> and that Chapter is a Prophecie of the
Goſpel, <hi>ver.</hi> 5.</p>
               <p>Now if the worſhip of God, and the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of his houſe, and every ordinance
thereof tend ſo much to his glory, and ſet him
up as King; then how much is he engaged to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
it? He will fully ſhew himſelfe to be <hi>King
of Saints</hi> in his <hi>worſhip,</hi> as well as <hi>King of Nations</hi>
in his <hi>works.</hi> And therefore as his <hi>work</hi> is ſaid to
<hi>be perfect, Deut.</hi> 32. 4. ſo he will in the end make
his <hi>worſhip perfect,</hi> (I ſpeak for the outward admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration
of it) even the <hi>perfection of beauty,</hi> (as
the Pſalmiſt calls it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50. 2.) which it cannot
be ſtyled, whilſt any part is wanting, or miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placed:
or (to conclude this reaſon in the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
of the Metaphor in the Text) God is not
like <hi>the fooliſh builder,</hi> that will begin to <hi>lay the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of his Church,</hi> and not fully perfect and <hi>fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh</hi>
it.</p>
               <p>The firſt Uſe ſhall be an extract of the firſt
Branch of this Doctrine.<note place="margin">Uſe 1.</note> Let Gods people there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
know their ſtrength; Though their enemies
be as mountaines, yet in a cauſe of God and his
Church, let them not be <hi>affrighted</hi> at them, <hi>Deut.</hi>
                  <pb n="37" facs="tcp:111727:21"/>
7. 21. yea let them <hi>deſpiſe</hi> them all, as the phraſe
is, <hi>Eſay</hi> 37. 22. When <hi>Rabſhekah</hi> brought a threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
Ambaſſage from the King of Aſſyria, with
this Preface unto it, <hi>Thus ſaith the great King, the
King of Aſſyria, (Eſay</hi> 36. 4.) <hi>where are they among
all the gods of the countries, that have delivered their
land out of my hand? &amp;c.</hi> In anſwer to this, what
doth good <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> through the Prophets en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement,
returne againe, but this, <hi>The Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin,
the daughter of Sion hath deſpiſed thee, Eſay</hi> 37.
22. Although ſhe be but a virgin, yet ſhe hath a
Champion who is in love with her, that will take
her part, and fight her quarrell. The people of
God are weak in themſelves, but they have a
ſtrong <hi>Captaine;</hi> ſo Chriſt declares himſelfe to
be unto them, <hi>Joſh. 5. 14. As the Captaine of the
Lords Hoaſt am I come.</hi> And if a Lyon be the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,
though the Armie conſiſts but of Harts
and Sheep; yet they will be too hard for the
wolves that come againſt them. It is the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon
the Scripture uſeth, <hi>Eſa. 31. 4. Like as the
Lion and the young Lion roaring on his prey, when a
multitude of ſhepheards are called forth againſt him;
ſo ſhall the Lord of Hoaſts come downe to fight for mount
Sion, and for the hill thereof.</hi> And then how <hi>ſtill</hi>
and quiet is the <hi>enemie</hi> and <hi>avenger!</hi> Jeſus
Chriſt was borne, as to be a King, ſo a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querour;
and we may ſtyle him <hi>King Jeſus the
Conquerour;</hi> ſo <hi>Rev. 6. 2. He went forth conquering,
and to conquer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If God will throw downe all mountains of
oppoſition,<note place="margin">Uſe 2.</note> that hinder the perfecting of his
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:111727:22"/>
Church: Then get up your Faith and reſolution,
for this great worke of reforming the Church,
and forecaſt not what oppoſition you are like to
encounter with, get but your hearts filled with
Faith, and you will be able to ſay, (as <hi>Zerubbabel</hi>
here) <hi>Who art thou, O great Mountaine?</hi> It was long
ere <hi>Zerubbabel</hi> could be brought to believe, or to
reſolve to doe it, the diſcouragements were ſo
great: the greater mountaine of the two was the
unbeliefe in his owne heart; but when he once did
reſolve to ſet upon the worke, he found all thoſe
mountains to vaniſh before him. To ſpeake ſtill in
the language of the metaphor here, Have but as
much <hi>faith as a grain of muſtard-ſeed,</hi> and you may
<hi>ſay to this mountain, Be removed into the ſea, and it ſhall
be removed: Hezekiah</hi> was a great Reformer, <hi>he
removed the high places, and brake the Images, and
cut downe the Groves, and brake in pieces the Brazen
Serpent, 2 Kings</hi> 18. 4. and then withall it is added
in the following words, <hi>He truſted in the Lord God
of Iſrael, ver.</hi> 5. They that will reforme a Church
or State, muſt truſt more in God in doing it, then
in any work elſe.</p>
               <p>Is a word of Caution:<note place="margin">Uſe 3.</note> For if the worſhip of
God and every part of it doth ſo much concerne
Gods glory, (as hath been ſhewed in the Reaſon
of this Doctrine) then take heed how you med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
with it. Be ſure you ſet the <hi>ſervice of the houſe
of the Lord</hi> in its right <hi>order,</hi> (as the phraſe is of <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zekiahs</hi>
Reformation, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29. 35.) and that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to cleare light from the word of truth.
Know and conſider, that you meddle with edged
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:111727:22"/>
tooles, when you take this work in hand. Which
I ſpeak, not to diſcourage you from it; but to
make you wary in, and attentive to it, more then
all the works you ever did ſet your hands and
hearts unto. It was a good and a religious purpoſe
in <hi>David</hi> to bring back the Arke; and for the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
of the duty, he was right in it; he miſtook
but in the order: he ſet it upon a cart, when as the
Prieſts ſhoulders ſhould have carryed it. Himſelfe
thus ſpeaks of it, <hi>We ſought not God after the due or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi>
(that is, Gods Inſtitution) 1 <hi>Chro.</hi> 15. 30. And
when it was like to fall, (God confuting thereby
their errour) <hi>Uzzah</hi> did but touch it to keep it up,
(and that too was done out of a good zeale) God
ſmote him for it; though God himſelfe acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth
it to have been but an <hi>error,</hi> or <hi>raſhneſſe</hi>
in him, even when hee ſmote him, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 6. 7.
<hi>The anger of the Lord was kindled againſt Uz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zah,
and God ſmote him for his [errour.]</hi> But yet
it was an errour about the Arke, (Gods wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,)
and a ſmall one there is dangerous. But you
will then ſay, We had beſt not meddle with it at
all, but let it alone, and leave it as it is. It is true,
that <hi>David</hi> himſelfe in his feare had juſt the ſame
thoughts, 1 <hi>Chron. 13. 12. David</hi> was <hi>afraid of God
that day, How</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>ſhall I bring the Ark of God
home to me?</hi> If men be ſtricken thus for touching
of it, God be mercifull to me, (thought he) let
it rather remaine where it is. <hi>So David brought not
the Ark home to himſelfe, but carryed it aſide into the
houſe of Obed Edom, ver.</hi> 13. But God did ſoon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute
him of this his error alſo; for the 14. <hi>ver.</hi> tels
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:111727:23"/>
us, that <hi>The Lord bleſſed the houſe of Obed Edom, and
all that he had.</hi> And then <hi>David</hi> began to bethink
himſelfe, surely if it brings a bleſſing upon the
houſe of <hi>Obed Edom,</hi> it will doe the like on mine
too. And then we reade in the 13. <hi>Chap. He prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
a place for it, and brought it home;</hi> and he being
by this breach made, put upon ſearching into the
Word, found that the <hi>Levites</hi> onely <hi>ought to carry
it,</hi> and that becauſe <hi>they did it not at the firſt, the
Lord</hi> therefore <hi>made a breach upon them, ver.</hi> 30.
Now above all all obſerve, that when he amen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
that errour, and brought it home, he was
bleſt, and <hi>bleſt indeede:</hi> For no ſooner did hee
thinke of building a houſe for it, but God promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
to eſtabliſh his houſe for ever. 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7. 11.
And reade the 18. <hi>Chapter,</hi> and you ſhall ſee how
all his enemies upon this were ſubdued afore him.
And then of his ſonne <hi>Solomon,</hi> God ſayes in the
13. <hi>ver. He ſhall build an houſe for my name, and I will
eſtabliſh the Throne of his Kingdome for ever:</hi> His
own houſe and the Kingdome were eſtabliſhed
together by it. Thus likewiſe when this ſecond
Temple was to be finiſhed, God provokes them
to it by this, <hi>[From this time will I bleſſe you,] Hag.</hi>
2. 19. And as he bleſſed them, ſo he will bleſſe
you, and your families, and the Kingdome. To
inſtance in ſome particulars, (which have been
in your hearts alſo, as that purpoſe was in <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids)</hi>
together with encouragements out of the
Scriptures ſuited thereunto. You have declared
your godly reſolution to be (to expreſſe it in your
own words) to <hi>uſe your utmoſt endeavours to eſtabliſh
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:111727:23"/>
learned and preaching Miniſters, with a good and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
maintenance throughout the whole Kingdome,
wherein many dark corners are miſerably deſtitute of
the means of ſalvation;</hi> which project tendeth to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large
Chriſts myſticall Church. <hi>From this time God
will bleſſe you;</hi> (look for it) and eſtabliſh the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
by it. The Scripture for your encourageme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
holds forth an example of juſt the like practice
of one of the beſt Kings, and of that ſame bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
following upon it, which is in all your aims,
2 <hi>Chron. 17. 7, 8, 9, 10. Jehoſhaphat in the third yeare
of his raigne ſent to his Princes, to teach</hi> (that is, to
countenance the teaching of the Word) <hi>in the
Cities of Judah, and with them the Levites and Prieſts,
and they taught in Judah, and had the Book of the
Law of the Lord with them, and went throughout all
the Cities of Judah, and taught the people.</hi> Here is
the ſame practice that you have reſolved upon; &amp;
the ſucceſſe is anſwerable to your hearts deſires:
For <hi>ver.</hi> 10. it followes, <hi>And the feare of the Lord fell
upon all the Kingdomes of the Lands that were round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
Judah; &amp; they made no warre againſt Iehoſhaphat.</hi>
This will ſecure the Land, as much as that poſture
of Warre you intend. You have alſo iſſued out an
Order for the purging out <hi>divers Innovations in &amp;
about the worſhip of God, for the aboliſhing of all Cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixes,
ſcandalous pictures, &amp;c.</hi> and other the like ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitions.
Go on to eſtabliſh it; you will eſtabliſh the
Kingdome by it. Not to quote the book of <hi>Kings</hi>
and <hi>Chronicles,</hi> which is abundant in ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples;
we have an inſtance more ancient of
the like bleſſing of God upon the like practice,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:111727:24"/>
                  <hi>Gen. 35. Jacob</hi> reformed his family <hi>of all their
ſtrange Gods, and all their eare-rings, ver.</hi> 2. &amp; 4.
and the ſucceſſe was, that <hi>the terrour of God was
upon all the Cities round about them, ver.</hi> 5. You
have likewiſe declared, that you intend <hi>a due
and neceſſary Reformation of the Government and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgie
of the Church, &amp;c.</hi> you will finde the
like bleſſing to be upon this alſo, in the Warre
you have undertaken againſt the Popiſh Iriſh
Rebels. When <hi>Abijah</hi> King of <hi>Judah</hi> was to
fight with <hi>Jeroboam</hi> King of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that had
perverted the worſhip of the Lord, ſee how he
pleades the cauſe againſt them and his Armie;
<hi>Ye have caſt out the Prieſts of the Lord, but as for us
the Lord is our God, and we have not forſaken him, and
the Prieſts which miniſter unto the Lord are the Sons of
Aaron;</hi> that is, ſuch as by Gods owne appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
were to governe the Church, and to mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
afore the Lord: <hi>And they burne unto the Lord
every morning and every evening, burnt Sacrifices, and
ſweete incenſe; the ſhew-bread alſo ſet they in order upon
the pure Table, and the Candleſtick of gold with the
Lamps thereof: We keepe the charge of the Lord our
God, but you have forſaken him, and behold, God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
is with us for our Captain, but you ſhall not proſper,
&amp;c. ver. 9, 10, 11, &amp;</hi> 12. and the iſſue of all this
is recorded; <hi>ver. 16, &amp; 17. God ſmote Jeroboam,
and all Iſrael before Abijah and Judah, and the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of Iſrael ſled before Judah, and Abijah and his
people ſlew them with a great ſlaughter, ſo that the
children of Iſrael were brought under at that time.</hi>
But on the contrary, If you falter in the matter
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:111727:24"/>
of <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Worſhip,</hi> know, that <hi>from that
time God will curſe you,</hi> as he did <hi>Jeroboam</hi> and
<hi>Iſrael</hi> with him; who when he had ſet up the
calves, to hold the people to him, God threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens
his houſe to take it away, <hi>as a man take away
dung untill it be all gone, 1 King.</hi> 14. 10. And as for Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael
and the ſtate of that Kingdome, he threatneth
<hi>to ſmite it as a Reede is ſhaken with the water, ver.</hi> 15.
Whereas you may ſtand as a Rock in the waters,
and all alterations and turnings of the ſtreame
would but daſh and breake themſelves upon you,
you all that while abiding firme &amp; immoved; you
will then become as a reede in the waters, toſſed
up and downe, with contrary motions of feares
and troubles, as the ſtreame carryes you this
way or that way, even as that ſtate of Iſrael
from that time was but fluctuating, and at beſt,
<hi>unſtable as waters</hi> with variety of governments
and Governours, the ſtreame of the people ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
turning one way, ſometimes another, (as
in the ſtory appeares;) and in the end, God ſayes
that he will <hi>root up Iſrael out of this good Land,</hi> and
pluck up this Reede even by the roots, when it
hath beene toſt a while up and downe. So it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
there.</p>
               <p>I will end this Caution with two Rules. Firſt,
be ſure you eſtabliſh nothing but what you have
full, cleare, and generall light for. Secondly,
condemne nothing, and ſuffer nothing to ſtand
condemned, in which, you in your conſciences
are doubtfull, there may be a truth: For if you
ſhould build the leaſt <hi>Hay</hi> and <hi>Stubble,</hi> you <hi>will</hi> not
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:111727:25"/>
onely <hi>ſuffer loſſe,</hi> but lay a foundation of a new
rent and diviſion in the age to come. For there is
a <hi>Spirit</hi> mentioned in the Text, even the Holy
Ghoſt, who will not reſt working in mens ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
till the whole building be rightly framed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the pattern in every piece of it. And
what ever is amiſſe, and not according to his
minde, the light of his fire will both <hi>diſcover</hi> it
and <hi>burne</hi> it up, which leads me to the 5. Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
which is this:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That God carryes on the work of finiſhing his Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">5. Obſer.</note>
                  <hi>[not by power nor might, but by his Spirit.]</hi> By
<hi>Spirit</hi> he meaneth the holy Ghoſt, by a more
immediate hand ſtirring up mens ſpirits unto this
work; turning and convincing them of the truth,
and of their duty towards it; and likewiſe by co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>incident
acts of Providence, ſo apparently whee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
about to the effecting of it, that though <hi>might</hi>
and <hi>power</hi> be brought to concur in it, yet ſo as his
hand alone ſhall be ſeene and acknowledged in it.
And thus his <hi>[Spirit]</hi> here is manifeſtly interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in the 10. <hi>ver.</hi> where it is ſaid, that as all ſhould
<hi>ſee the Plummet in the hand of Zerubbabel,</hi> (the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of building it) ſo they ſhould perceive thoſe
<hi>ſeven eyes of the Lord, which run to and fro through
the whole earth:</hi> (that is, his eyes of Providence,
called <hi>ſeven,</hi> becauſe of their perfection) theſe to
have ſo guided and managed all the affairs there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
that all the rayes and beames of Providence
iſſuing from thoſe eyes, might be ſeene to meet
in the accompliſhment of this, as their ultimate
aime and ſcope. Now theſe <hi>ſeven eyes, Rev.</hi> 5. 6.
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:111727:25"/>
are called <hi>the ſeven Spirits of God, ſent forth into all
the earth:</hi> And <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. 4. are plainly interpreted to
be the holy Ghoſt in his various workings, for
<hi>Grace and Peace</hi> is there wiſhed <hi>from the ſeven Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits.</hi>
Thus much for the explication of it.</p>
               <p>Now that the building of the Temple is thus
more immediately carryed on by the working of
the holy Ghoſt, you may reade it all along in all
the ſtory of the building of this Temple in the
Old Teſtament, as likewiſe in that of the New.</p>
               <p>Firſt, the laying the <hi>Foundation</hi> of this Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
it was done indeed by the <hi>power</hi> and <hi>might</hi> of
<hi>Cyrus;</hi> but yet <hi>Ezra</hi> 1. and 2. it is added, <hi>The Lord
ſtirred up the ſpirit of Cyrus;</hi> and how, but by a
meere act of fore-ſight or providence afore-hand
about it? God had an hundred yeers before his
birth, by his <hi>Spirit</hi> written a Prophecie of him,
and that by name, <hi>Eſay 44. ult.</hi> which theſe Jews
ſhewing him, Gods Spirit ſtirred up his ſpirit
thereby; for in his Proclamation himſelf ſayes,
<hi>The Lord hath charged me to build him an houſe at Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi>
ſo <hi>ver.</hi> 2. of <hi>Ezra</hi> 1. And when he had thus
given leave to the Jews to goe and build it, yet
ſtill it was a great matter of ſelf-denyall to them,
to <hi>leave their houſes and gardens which they had built
and planted at Babylon, Jer.</hi> 29. 5. Therefore it is
further added in the 5. <hi>ver.</hi> of that 1. of <hi>Ezra, Then
roſe up the chiefe of the Fathers, and the Prieſts and
Levites, with all them whoſe [ſpirit God had raiſed up]
to build the houſe of the Lord.</hi> And then again, when
it came to this ſecond work, the <hi>Finiſhing</hi> of it,
they were exceeding backward to it; but God
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:111727:26"/>
ſent Two Prophets, who convinced them of their
duty; and therefore <hi>Hag.</hi> 1. 14. it is expreſly and on
purpoſe put in, that <hi>The [Lord ſtirred up the ſpirit]
of Zerubbabel, and the ſpirit of Jeſhuah, and the ſpirit
of all the remnant of the people, and they came and
did work in the houſe of the Lord their God.</hi> And
againe, whereas the Perſian Kings had made De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees
againſt the building of it, (which was the
greateſt impediment of all the reſt) God brought
<hi>Darius</hi> his heart at laſt off to it, and that by ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected
a way, as made all the people joyfull:
So it is expreſly ſaid, <hi>EZra 6. 22. They kept the feaſt
of unleavened bread with joy; for the Lord had made
them joyfull, and had turned the heart of the King
of Aſſyria unto them, to ſtrengthen their hands in the
work of the houſe of God.</hi> Yea and his heart was ſo
much ſtirred in it, that he not onely makes a <hi>Decree</hi>
for it, <hi>ver.</hi> 8. but likewiſe againſt all thoſe that
ſhould oppoſe it, under a capitall puniſhment,
<hi>ver.</hi> 11. yea, he curſeth all that ſhould <hi>put to their
hand to alter it, ver.</hi> 12. ſo that the enemies that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
oppoſed it, were now conſtrained to further
it, <hi>ver.</hi> 13. All this was done, (as you ſee) <hi>Not by
power, nor by might, but by Gods Spirit.</hi> Thus much
for this inſtance in the Text out of the <hi>Old</hi> Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament.</p>
               <p>See the like in Gods building his Church in
the <hi>New;</hi> Both in ſetting up his Church in the
world at firſt, when Heatheniſme backt with the
power of the Romane Empire ſtood in the way of
it; and likewiſe in raiſing it up againe, when An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt
had throwne it downe. For the firſt, (the
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:111727:26"/>
Erecting of it) Did he uſe <hi>might,</hi> or <hi>power,</hi> or an
<hi>Armie</hi> (as it is varied in the margent) to conquer
the world by? No ſuch matter: He chooſeth
twelve or thirteene men, whereof the moſt were
poore fiſher-men; and he ſends them not all to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
in one troop neither, but diſperſed apart
into ſeverall parts of the world, ſome taking one
Country to conquer, ſome another: The moſt ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous
courſe in appearance, for ſuch a deſigne,
that could be imagined. Yet (as <hi>Revel.</hi> 6. 2.)
Chriſt in theſe went forth <hi>conquering, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer,</hi>
and took nothing with him but his <hi>Bow,</hi> (as
it is there) and his <hi>Arrowes,</hi> (as it is <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45. 5.)
the preaching of the Goſpel, even <hi>the fooliſhneſſe of
preaching,</hi> (as the Apoſtle calls it) yet hereby the
<hi>people fell ſo under him,</hi> (as the Pſalmiſts phraſe
there is) that in three hundred yeares that whole
Empire was turned Chriſtian, and Heatheniſh
worſhip throwne downe; and this you ſee <hi>not by
power, nor by might, but by his Spirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But then again Antichriſt ſteps up, the Beaſt
of <hi>Rome,</hi> and <hi>after Him all the world wondered,</hi> (that
is, the European world,) <hi>Revel.</hi> 13. 3. ſaying,
<hi>Who is like unto the Beaſt? who is able to make warre
with him? ver.</hi> 4. But at the 14. <hi>Chap. a Lambe</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counters
him, and but with a handfull in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon,
out from among whom he ſends a few emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries,
to <hi>preach the everlaſting Goſpell to every Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
tongue, and kindred: ver. 6, &amp;c.</hi> and in the end
he wins all the Northerne Kingdomes, to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
that Goſpell, and will ſtil goe on to conquer
and winne ground, ſo that in the 15. <hi>Chap.</hi> and
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:111727:27"/>
2. <hi>ver.</hi> we reade of a perfect victory over the
Beaſt: And whereas before it had beene ſaid of
his <hi>Holineſſe</hi> the Pope, <hi>Who is like unto the Beaſt?</hi>
Now it is ſaid, <hi>ver. 4. Who ſhall not feare thee, O
Lord? for thou [onely art holy.]</hi> And whereas afore
<hi>All the world wondred after the Beaſt, and worſhipped
him;</hi> the world is now ſo altered, that it is ſaid, <hi>All
Nations ſhall come &amp; worſhip before THEE,</hi> in the ſame
4. <hi>v.</hi> And now the <hi>wonder</hi> is as much, how all this is
brought about: <hi>Not by power, nor by might, but by his
Spirit.</hi> So it is expreſly ſaid, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2. 8. ſpeaking of
<hi>this man of ſin,</hi> he ſayes, <hi>Whom the Lord ſhall conſume
with the [Spirit of his mouth:]</hi> that is, by his Spirit, in
the preaching of the Goſpel, and working in the
hearts of men, and <hi>overcomming</hi> Kingdomes unto
Chriſt and his Church: So we reade <hi>Revel.</hi> 17. 4.
<hi>The Lambe ſhall overcome the Kings that made war
with him,</hi> and yet not by <hi>power,</hi> but by his <hi>Spirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Reaſon of this is,<note place="margin">Reaſ.</note> becauſe the building of
Gods Church is his <hi>owne buſineſſe,</hi> in a more ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
manner, more then any other; therefore he
will be ſure to doe it himſelfe, and more immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
be ſeene in it. As it is ſaid of <hi>Chriſt Perſonall,</hi>
(the <hi>Tabernacle</hi> of his humane nature) <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 12.
that it was <hi>not made with hands, that is to ſay, not
of this building,</hi> (as the Apoſtle there ſpeaks) that
is, It was not framed by the power of nature, as
other men are, but by the Spirit: So it is true of
<hi>Chriſt myſticall,</hi> his Body, and the Tabernacle of
his Church. It is not of the ordinary make that
other ſocieties of men (whether Families or King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes)
are of; it is <hi>not made with hands,</hi> (with hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:111727:27"/>
wiſdome or power, as they are) <hi>that is to ſay,
is not of this building.</hi> Thus <hi>Heb. 3. 4. Every houſe</hi>
(ſayes the Apoſtle) <hi>is built by ſome man;</hi> That is,
All Kingdomes, Families, and Societies, God in
an ordinary providence leaves to men to build in
their owne way; but (ſayes he) <hi>He that built all
things, is God.</hi> Which is ſpoken of Gods building
his Church, (which is his houſe) and all things
appertaining unto it, as is evident both by the
fore-going words, <hi>ver. 3. He that built the houſe</hi>
(the Apoſtle ſpeaking of Chriſt, who is God)
<hi>hath more honour then the houſe:</hi> And alſo by thoſe
words that follow after, <hi>Moſes was faithfull in all
his houſe,</hi> (namely, in the building of that houſe
then) <hi>as a ſervant:</hi> but Chriſt <hi>as a Son over his
owne houſe,</hi> (now) <hi>whoſe houſe are we.</hi> The reaſon
why thus himſelfe by his Spirit builds it, is held
forth in that one world, It is his <hi>[owne]</hi> houſe: and
therefore he will over-ſee the doing this himſelf,
and will doe it ſo, that none ſhall ſhare in the glory
with him, although he uſeth them.</p>
               <p>Firſt Uſe,<note place="margin">Uſe 1.</note> is, that which is made of it in the
10. <hi>verſe,</hi> namely that in matters which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
the building of the Church, we ſhould learne
to <hi>deſpiſe the day of ſmall things:</hi> The Prophet
ſpeakes it by way of reproofe, <hi>Who hath deſpiſed
the day of ſmall things?</hi> Becauſe the beginnings
of this worke then were but ſmall, and there was
little appearance in humane fore-ſight to effect it:
Therefore, <hi>who</hi> almoſt was there that did not
<hi>deſpiſe</hi> it, and deſpaire of it? Remember that
there is a <hi>Spirit</hi> in the Text, and no man knowes
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:111727:28"/>
how far he may carry on the ſmalleſt beginnings,
which he layes as the foundation of his greateſt
works, that his owne immediate hand may the
more appeare. <hi>The Kingdome of heaven</hi> was at firſt
but as a <hi>graine of muſtard-ſeed,</hi> (ſayes Chriſt) <hi>the
leaſt of all ſeeds; but when it is growne, it is the greateſt
of hearbs, and becomes a tree, Mat.</hi> 13. 32. In the 2.
of <hi>Dan. ver.</hi> 34, &amp; 45. there is mention made of
<hi>a ſtone</hi> that was <hi>cut out of the Mountain without hands;</hi>
which expreſſion is uſed not onely to ſhew the
Divine power that accompanied it, but to inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate,
that it was at firſt but ſome little ſtone,
which without hands dropt out, or was blowne
downe from the Mountaine; for if it had beene a
great one, it muſt then have had hands to cut and
hew it out, and to throw it downe. And yet loe
this little ſtone <hi>became a mountaine, and filled the
whole earth,</hi> as it there follows.</p>
               <p>A Second Uſe is, that which is in the Text,
that when you ſee any thing done for Gods
Church beyond the reach of humane wiſdome
and fore-ſight, that you would fall downe and
<hi>cry</hi> (as they are taught here <hi>ver.</hi> 7.) <hi>Grace, Grace
unto it:</hi> You are not to cry up <hi>Zerubbabel, Zerub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>babel,</hi>
that is, any meanes or inſtrument whatever,
whether King or Parliament, much leſſe this man,
or that man, but to exalt the free grace of God,
the worke of which alone it is and hath beene.</p>
               <p>One word more unto <hi>Zerubbabel,</hi> the Text cals
for it; <hi>This is the word of the Lord unto Zerubbabel.</hi>
From which let the Obſervation be this:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That this worke of finiſhing the Temple, lies firſt
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:111727:28"/>
and chiefly upon Zerubbabel, and his Elders to take
care of:</hi> That is, upon Prince and Elders. And
though <hi>Jeſhuah</hi> and his fellowes the Prieſts are
intended, (as being the one of thoſe Olive trees
formerly mentioned) yet <hi>Zerubbabel</hi> and the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates
are onely ſpoken to. All ſuch motions
ſhould come firſt from You; it is Your duty to
be the <hi>he-goats of the flock to lead on all the reſt,</hi> as the
Prophet <hi>EZekiel</hi> ſpeaks: Thus <hi>EZra 1. 5. Then roſe
up the chiefe of the Fathers of Judah and Benjamin,
to build the houſe of the Lord:</hi> It had otherwiſe ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
been done to purpoſe. So in the building of
the Temple at firſt, the motion came firſt into <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids</hi>
heart; 1 <hi>Chro. 29. 3. I have</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>ſet my affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
to the houſe of God:</hi> And then, <hi>ver. 6. The chiefe
of the Fathers and Princes of the houſe of Iſrael,</hi> they
follow; and <hi>then</hi> fell in the <hi>people,</hi> and they <hi>rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced</hi>
and <hi>offered willingly,</hi> ſo <hi>ver.</hi> 13. You ſhould com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
unto the people what is good and right. <hi>Let
us bring back the Ark of our God unto us,</hi> (ſaid <hi>David,</hi>
1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 13. 3.) and no ſooner had he commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
it unto them, but (as it followes, <hi>ver.</hi> 4.) <hi>all the
congregation ſaid, they would doe ſo, for the thing was
right in the eyes of all the people.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And the reaſon why this is your more eſpeciall
duty, is, becauſe God hath honoured Princes and
Magiſtrates above, and ſet them over others: <hi>And
as thoſe who honour God, God will honour;</hi> ſo thoſe
whom God hath honoured, he expects ſhould
honour him; and you cannot doe it better then
this way: For how much his honour is concerned
in his worſhip, you heard before.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="52" facs="tcp:111727:29"/>
Let the honour of it move you: Take the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned
men in Scripture, and their greateſt glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
hath been to be builders of Gods houſe. It is
mentioned as <hi>Moſes</hi> his higheſt honour, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3. 2,
3, 4. And <hi>David</hi> (though a King already) ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts
this a greater honour then his Crowne. So
1 <hi>Chron. 29. 14. Who am I,</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>and what is my
people, that we ſhould offer ſo willingly?</hi> He ſpeaks
it of offering towards the building of the Temple.
And in the New Teſtament it is the Apoſtles ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
that they were <hi>Maſter-builders;</hi> yea it is
made Chriſts higheſt honour, <hi>Heb. 3. 3. This man
was accounted worthy of more glory then Moſes; in as
much as he who hath builded the houſe, hath more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
then the houſe.</hi> So far as you are capable of
it, and have power to doe it, be in this conformed
unto him. The Prize of this honour is ſet before
you, and you have the firſt offer of it. An opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
ſuch as theſe laſt hundred yeeres wellnigh
have not afforded the like to it. This Parliament
ſeemes to have been called by God, <hi>for ſuch a time
as this;</hi> and if you will not doe it, God will doe it
without you: As he ſaid that <hi>Deliverance,</hi> ſo (ſay I)
<hi>Reformation will ariſe ſome other way;</hi> God hath a
Spirit here in the Text, that will worke it out in
mens hearts, if power and might ſhould not: And
<hi>That will be little to your honour,</hi> as <hi>Deborah</hi> ſaid to <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rak.</hi>
In the 5. of <hi>Micah, ver. 7. The remnant of Jacob</hi>
is ſaid to be <hi>as a dew from the Lord, and as the ſhowers
upon the graſſe, [that tarrieth not for man, nor waiteth
for the ſons of men.]</hi> The Prophet uſeth two ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes,
to ſhew both that the multiplication and
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:111727:29"/>
growth of the Church depend not upon man;
firſt, for their propagation, and their being multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed,
he compares them unto the <hi>dew</hi> which is
engendred and diſtilled from Heaven immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
Therefore <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110. 3. New converts added
unto the Church are compared unto the <hi>Dew,</hi> and
Gods begetting of them unto the <hi>womb of the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,</hi>
when over-night, the earth was dry. Again,
the growth and maintaining of them he compares
unto the ſprouting up of herbs and graſſe in wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſes
where man comes not, &amp; ſo their ſpring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>tarrieth not for man, nor waiteth for the ſons of
men,</hi> for them to come with watering pots to nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh
them, (as herbs in gardens do) but theſe have
<hi>ſhowers from heaven</hi> that give the encreaſe: <hi>I the

               <head>The Concluſion.</head>
               <p>NOw for a Concluſion, and winding up of
all. Is this Word of the Lord ſpoken to
you, in a way of generall Application onely,
ſuch as ſimilitudinary examples (which in ſome
things hold a likeneſſe) uſe to have, <hi>(All things hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening</hi>
in the Old Teſtament <hi>for examples, and are
written for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the
world are come,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.
11?) Or is there not ſome more ſpeciall word
that applyes this Viſion of the <hi>Candleſtick</hi> &amp; <hi>Olive
Trees,</hi> as Prophetique Types of the like work of
<hi>finiſhing the Temple,</hi> to fall out under the times of
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:111727:30"/>
the Goſpel, when the Church is come out of Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry?
That <hi>Babylon</hi> was the Prophetique Type of
<hi>Rome,</hi> you all know where to find that; it is in the
17. and 18. of the <hi>Rev.</hi> and ſo applyed by the holy
Ghoſt. And that the <hi>foundation</hi> of this Temple was
the type of our firſt <hi>Reformation</hi> when we came out
from Babylon, was in the firſt Obſervation ſhewn
you, out of <hi>Chap.</hi> 14. and 15. And that the <hi>Sama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritans</hi>
are by the holy Ghoſt made the type of
thoſe that ſhall in any Age <hi>corrupt</hi> the worſhip of
God, by mingling Idolatrous or Popiſh <hi>ſuperſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi>
as our <hi>Innovators</hi> have done; we meet with the
application thereof, by the holy Ghoſt himſelfe,
unto ſome living in the beſt of Churches under
the Goſpel, namely, that of <hi>Philadelphia, Revel.</hi>
3. 9. <hi>who ſay they are Jews, and are not; Behold,</hi> (ſayes
God) <hi>I will make them to come and worſhip before thy
feet, and to know that I have loved thee,</hi> (as ſpeaking
unto that Church.) Now whereas the holy Ghoſt
deſcribing them to be ſuch as <hi>ſay they are Jews, but
are not,</hi> it is in a Periphraſis of ſpeech all one, as
to ſay they are <hi>Samaritans. Joſephus</hi> tels us, that
when the Jews were in a proſperous eſtate, the
Samaritans would then ſay that they were Jews;
and that fore-mentioned place, the 4. of <hi>EZra,</hi>
manifeſtly implyes as much; for they there plead,
<hi>We worſhip God as you doe, &amp;c.</hi> And although wee
paſſe not this judgement on mens <hi>perſons,</hi> yet we
may ſpeak of <hi>cauſes</hi> and things as the Scripture
hath done before us. Now as certaine it is, that
thoſe Gods Magiſtrates, who under the times of
the Goſpel, eſpecially in theſe laſt dayes, have
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:111727:30"/>
and ſhall aſſiſt the Reformation of the Churches
from under thoſe Samaritan ſuperſtitions, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mingled
with their worſhip, and ſhall afford their
countenance and aid to the finiſhing and perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting
the Temple, they are typiſied out by the
<hi>Olive trees</hi> here, (which were then, <hi>Zerubbabel</hi> their
chief Governour, and his <hi>Elders:)</hi> And according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
we find as expreſſe an application of it by the
holy Ghoſt himſelfe, as Prophetically intended
herein. Thus in the ſame booke of the <hi>Revel.</hi> (in
which Prophecie of the New Teſtament, the
Holy Ghoſt borrows all the elegancies and flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
in the ſtory of the Old, thereby to ſet out the
ſtory of the New in ſucceeding ages) in the 11.
<hi>Chap. ver.</hi> 4. the Holy Ghoſt deſcribes the <hi>Two
Witneſſes,</hi> that ſhould oppoſe the Beaſt and his
party in all (and eſpecially the later) ages, ſaying,
<hi>[Theſe are the two Olive trees, and the two Candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticks
ſtanding before the God of the Earth.]</hi> Where
by the <hi>Candleſticks</hi> are meant the <hi>Churches</hi> (as
was ſhewn before) and by the two <hi>Olive Trees</hi> the
eminent Magiſtrates and Miniſters that ſupply
Oyle, for the maintaining of theſe Churches light
and glory now, as <hi>Zerubbabel</hi> and <hi>Jeſhua</hi> the Prieſts
did then. Yea the Holy Ghoſt deciphers them not
only by the very ſame Hieroglyphique that is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
here in <hi>Zachary,</hi> but alſo he uſeth the very
ſame words which we find there in the interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of the Viſion, <hi>[ſtanding before the God of the
earth.]</hi> And further, this viſion of the <hi>Candleſtick,</hi> &amp;
thoſe <hi>two Olive Trees</hi> in <hi>Zachary,</hi> did ſignifie, as was
ſhewne, not ſo much (if at all) the firſt laying of
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:111727:31"/>
the <hi>foundation</hi> of the Temple, which had beene
done many yeares before, but was eminently (if
not onely to hold forth that worke of <hi>finiſhing,</hi> and
compleating it, which remained then to be done;
and to ſtirre them up thereunto was that viſion
as there given. Therefore anſwerably now, the
full analogie of the type muſt principally fall up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
not ſo much the firſt <hi>Reformation,</hi> or laying
the foundation of the Churches Reformation; as
upon a ſecond work of the perfecting and <hi>finiſhing</hi>
of them: And accordingly, as <hi>Zerubbabel</hi> there in
<hi>Zachary</hi> is ſeene <hi>with a Plummet in his hand, ver.</hi> 10.
to meaſure out what remained unfiniſhed for the
building of the Temple, ſo here in the 1. <hi>ver.</hi> of
the 11. of the <hi>Revel. John</hi> hath <hi>a Reed given him,</hi>
(he repreſenting the godly of thoſe ages) and is
bidden to <hi>meaſure the Temple of God, and the Altar,
and the Worſhippers,</hi> and this as ſuppoſing a Temple
to have beene already built, onely having too vaſt
and great an <hi>Outward Court</hi> laid to it, <hi>ver.</hi> 2. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
the computation of the whole time of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſts
raigne, is there mentioned and annexed to
theſe occurences; yet but to this end to ſhew how
that time allotted him to raigne ſhould end &amp; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,
and ſo in that to ſhew what paſſages ſhould
fall out in the Church, towards the expiration of
it, as a warning &amp; ſignall of it, (whereof theſe are
the chiefe) for <hi>Chap.</hi> before, <hi>ver.</hi> 6. the Angel that
gives that Prophecie in the 11. ſweares that <hi>time
ſhould be no longer:</hi> (that is, the Beaſts time:) but
<hi>untill the dayes of the ſeventh</hi> Trumpet which were
ſhortly then approaching: for immediately after
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:111727:31"/>
theſe occurrences rehearſed wee find that <hi>that
ſeventh Trumpet ſounds, ver.</hi> 15. of that 11. <hi>Chap.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But then you will ſay, There is mentioned
after this an overcomming and killing of theſe
witneſſes by a warre of the Beaſt, even his laſt
war againſt the Saints, whereby he ſhall throw
downe there Candleſticks, and cut downe theſe
Olive trees; And if ſo, where then is all the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement
which you have given?</p>
               <p>I dare not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that this killing is as yet to come;
it is the greateſt controverſie in this Book, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it be paſt or no; But however, ſuppoſing it
not yet paſt, to take off diſcouragements from
thence,</p>
               <p>Firſt, for the time of it, we know it not how
long, it may be a good while unto it, and in the
meane time we may yet enjoy a ſummer of the
Goſpel, and an harveſt of a better Reformation,
a little time of which (if it were to be bought)
were worth a world.</p>
               <p>Secondly, If you attentively obſerve it, you
ſhall finde that killing expreſſed by an alluſion un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Chriſts being crucified at laſt, and then their
riſing againe like his riſing againe with an <hi>earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake,</hi>
and <hi>aſcending into Heaven,</hi> as theſe are ſaid
to doe, <hi>ver.</hi> 11, 12, 13. Now with what doth
Chriſt comfort himſelfe before he was to dye?
<hi>Deſtroy this Temple,</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>and in three dayes I
will raiſe it up againe:</hi> With the ſame may you be
encouraged alſo, (though you ſuppoſed it yet to
come.) It is but a <hi>Deſtruite hoc Templum,</hi> a deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of that you are about to repaire, this Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:111727:32"/>
and but for three dayes and an halfe, no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
for <hi>After three dayes and an halfe,</hi> (as it is twice
ſaid, in the 9. and 11. <hi>verſes)</hi> God will reare it up
againe, and that with advantage, making a better
edition of it, even an Holy of Holies, in which the
<hi>Arke</hi> is <hi>ſeene,</hi> (as <hi>ver.</hi> 19.) in compariſon of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer.
Yea, and further, (as ſome think) this kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
ſhall be but a <hi>Civill</hi> death, that is, of them
as witneſſes onely; not a <hi>naturall</hi> death, as men:
(For how elſe are <hi>their bodies</hi> ſaid <hi>to lye dead</hi> for
<hi>three yeeres and an halfe?)</hi> And ſo the ſame perſons
ſhall riſe again and enjoy the fruit of their former
labours, and aſcend into a greater glory.</p>
               <p>And thirdly, ſuppoſe this ſhould come upon
you, even when you are <hi>about to finiſh</hi> your work,
(as the 7. <hi>ver.</hi> hath it, (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) when theſe
Olive trees <hi>are about to finiſh</hi> or [perfect] <hi>their teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,</hi>
(as ſome doe read it) yet let not even this
cauſe you any whit to forbeare this work: Chriſt
knew he was to be crucified, yet he caſts the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
changers out of the Temple; and ſo do you:
Purge and Reforme the Temple, though you die
for it, in the doing of it. It is worth the obſerving,
that though it was told good King <hi>Joſiah</hi> in the
beginning of his raigne, that God would bring
evill upon <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> becauſe of their Apoſtaſie
in <hi>Manaſſehs</hi> time, and he knew that all he could
doe in reforming ſhould not <hi>quench Gods wrath,</hi>
2 <hi>Kin.</hi> 16. 17. yet he reformed <hi>with all his might,</hi>
and therein <hi>there was no King before him, that was like
unto him, ver.</hi> 23, 25. Doe you your duty, and <hi>ſerve
your generation,</hi> (as <hi>David</hi> is ſaid to doe.) <hi>Be ſtrong,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:111727:32"/>
and let not your hands be weake, for your worke ſhall be
rewarded,</hi> as it is in 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 15. 7.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I conclude all with that ſpeech unto this whole
State, which</hi> David <hi>uſed to</hi> Solomon, <hi>concerning
the building of the Temple in his dayes,</hi> 1 Chron.
28. 20, 21. Be ſtrong and of good courage, [and doe it;]
Feare not, nor be diſmayed, for the Lord God will be with
thee, he will not faile thee, nor forſake thee, untill thou
haſt finiſhed all the worke for the ſervice of the houſe of
the Lord. And behold, the courſes of the Prieſts and the
Levites ſhall be with thee, for all the ſervice of the
houſe of God, alſo the Princes and the people will be
wholly at thy Commandment.</p>
