         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>An EXPLANATION of the Propoſal lately given in to the Honourable Houſe of Commons, ſignsed
<hi>William James.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>It is humbly propoſed that Guineas, and all other Gold Coins now currant, be brought into the <hi>Exchequer,</hi> or other Places as ſhall be appointed by a prefixt time; the Guineas at 30 <hi>ſh.</hi> a piece, and all other Gold proportionably; and at the ſame time to be ſet at 22 <hi>ſh.</hi> or lower, as the Houſe ſhall think ſit.</p>
            <p>And for every Hundred Guineas brought into the <hi>Exchequer,</hi> or other Places appointed, the Party who brings in the Hundred Guineas ſhall then receive Fifty Guineas back at 22 <hi>ſh.</hi> &amp;c. and a Tally or Bill for a Hundred Pound Silver, and ſo in proportion for a greater or leſſer Sum, which Tally or Bill ſhall be ſunk by Five Pound <hi>per Cent. per. Ann.</hi> till the whole Hundred Pound Tally or Bill be diſcharged: And in caſe of failure in not paying the Five Pound <hi>per Cent.</hi> due on the ſaid Tally or Bill at the time prefixt, the ſaid Tally or Bill to be void. But on the payment of the Money Yearly due by the ſaid Tally or Bill, a new Tally or Bill ſhall be given for the remaining Sum till the whole be diſcharged; and theſe Tallies or Bills to be currant in all payments to both King and People.</p>
            <p>That all the clipp'd Money good and bad be brought into the <hi>Exchequer</hi> or other Places as ſhall be appointed; and for every Hundred Pound, or more or leſs Sum brought in, the Party brioging it in ſhall receive the Moiety of new coined Silver or Gold, as ſetled above; and, at the ſame time, a Tally or Bill for the other Moiety, which ſhall be ſunk by Five Pound <hi>per Cent. per Ann.</hi> paid as above, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> till the whole Tally or Bill be diſcharged.</p>
            <p>Now when the new Silver Money is coined at the old Standard, as the Houſe have already re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved; then the Guineas will not be worth full 22 <hi>ſh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that whoever brings into the <hi>Exchequer</hi> or other Place appointed, a Hundred Guineas, will ſave Eight Shillings or more in each Guinea. And whoever brings in a Hundred Pound in baſe Money, and receives Fifty Pound in Gold or good Silver, as here propoſed, receives much more than the intrinſick Value he brings in. And whoever brings in a Hundred Pound in cloſe clipp'd good Money, and receives Fifty Pounds in Gold or good Silver, receives the full Value of what he brings, beſides his Tally, or Bill for the other half.</p>
            <p>And this Loſs falls upon the King.</p>
            <p>So that to repair this Loſs, the 5 <hi>l. per Cent. per Annum,</hi> is paid into the <hi>Exchequer</hi> to reimburſe the King; and if that be thought too much the Parliament may ſet it lower, and bring it as near a Ballance as they pleaſe.</p>
            <p>And it is much more reaſonable, this Diſeaſe that has been upwards of twenty Years growing, and is now become almoſt inſupportable, and will in a very little time ſtop all Commerce, ſhould be cured by a twenty Years remedy, which will be leſs felt, than that the Nation ſhould now (when there is at leaſt ſix Millions to be raiſed to carry on the War, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) bear this burthen all at once.</p>
            <div type="part">
               <p>
                  <hi>To reduce this into Practice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A Proclamation be ſet out for all Perſons on a certain Day to bring their Gold and Silver to be exchanged, to Perſons appointed in every Pariſh for that purpoſe. The whole Work may be done in two or three days. The Gold paying for the Silver as far as it will go, and Notes given for the Overplus, to be turned into Tallies or Bills in a very ſhort time after.</p>
               <p>To prevent the Counterfeiting of Tallies, it is propofed, That a piece of feal'd or ſtampt Parchment go along with every Tally or Bill, which upon every transfer, each Perſon ſets his Name and Place of Abode.</p>
               <p>If it be thought, That theſe Tallies or Bills be thruſt upon the King and People in pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and ſo in the mean while all the Coin will be carried out of the Kingdom; it may be provided in all payments where Tallies are given, there ſhall be the like Sum paid in Money.</p>
               <p>If this Propoſal be rejected, it may be conſidered what an intollerable Loſs will follow by the fall of the Gold, and the Loſs by the much clipt good Money, and the baſe Money, which cannot be computed to ſo little as three Millions; but if it be accepted, it immediately revives Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, increaſes the Caſh of the Nation, fettles the minds of the People, that are now in a great Ferment, which is like to be greater if not ſpeedily prevented.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>All which is humbly ſubmitted to the Wiſdom of the Honourable Houſe of Commons.</hi>
