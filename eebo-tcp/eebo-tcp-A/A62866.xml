            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>Jesus Christ is the Son of God in the sense professed in the <hi>Nicene</hi> Creed.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>THis leads us to enquire concerning the terms [Son of God, of Man, Christ, the Lord Jesus Christ] which are the titles by which he is expressed, whose the Kingdom is said to be, and therefore we cannot rightly conceive of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom without understanding these terms: That the title <hi>the Son of the living God,</hi> given to <hi>Jesus Christ the Son of Man</hi> is a fundamental Article of the Christian Faith, is manifest from Christs approbation of <hi>Peters</hi> answer to Christs question to his Disciples <hi>Matth. 16. 13. Whom do men say that I the Son of man am?</hi> To which St. <hi>Peter</hi> answered, verse 16. <hi>Thou art the Christ the Son of the living God,</hi> whereto it is said <hi>Jesus answered and said unto him, Blessed art thou</hi> Simon Bar-Jona, <hi>for flesh and blood hath not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed it unto thee, but my Father which

is in Heaven:</hi> And again, when Jesus said to the twelve, <hi>Will ye also go away?</hi> Simon Peter <hi>answered him, Lord, to whom shall we go? thou hast the words of eternal life, and we believe and are sure that thou art that Christ the Son of the living God,</hi> John 6. 68, 69. And when the <hi>Eunuch</hi> said to <hi>Philip,</hi> Acts 8. 36. <hi>See here is water, what doth hinder me to be Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized? Philip</hi> said, <hi>If thou believest with all thine heart thou maist, and he answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and said, I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God,</hi> verse 37. St. <hi>Paul</hi> Acts 9. 20. <hi>preached Christ in the Synagogues at</hi> Dimascus, <hi>that he is the Son of God.</hi> and <hi>John</hi> 1. 49.

He is Antichrist that denieth the Father and the Son.</hi> verse 23. <hi>Whosoever denieth the Son, the same hath not the Father.</hi> 1 John 4. 15. <hi>Whosoever shall confess that Jesus is the Son of God, God dwelleth in him, and he in God.</hi> 1 John 5. 5. <hi>Who is he that overcometh the world but he that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth that Jesus is the Son of God?</hi> verse 11, 12. <hi>And this is the record<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> that God hath given to us eternal life, and this

life is in his Son: He that hath the Son hath life, he that hath not the Son hath not life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nevertheless there is great difference about this appellation [the Son of God] whether it import Divine Nature distinct from Humane, or Humane Nature, yet by Divine operation, not by the ordinary way of natural generation as other men are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten, but by the supernatural operation of the Holy Ghost according to that of the Angel to <hi>Mary, Luke 1. 35. The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee; Therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee, shall be called the Son of God.</hi> Whence the <hi>Samosatenians</hi> and <hi>Photinians</hi> of old, so the <hi>Socinians</hi> in this last age deny that Jesus Christ had Being afore his conception by the Holy Ghost in the Virgins womb, but the <hi>Arians</hi> grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him to have a Divine Nature, say, that he was created by God the first creature out of nothing, and then that by him God the Father made all things else: In oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition to whom the Creed of the first <hi>Nicene</hi> Councel, as it is in <hi>Eusebius</hi> his Epistle to the Church of <hi>Caesarea</hi> set down by Arch-Bishop

very God of very God, of the same substance with the Father, by whom all things were made: The <hi>minor</hi> is almost the express words of the Text, the <hi>major</hi> is evident from the equivolence of terms, it being all one to be God in the beginning by whom all things were made, the world was made, the only begotten of the Father in his bosom before <hi>John</hi> Baptist as to be before any creature was made, begotten of the substance of the father, not made of nothing, very God of very God, of the same substance with the Father, by whom all things were made.</p>

world in the beginning even from <hi>Gen. 1. For wherefore,</hi> saith he, <hi>I beseech you, should</hi> Moses <hi>(which no where else is done in the whole Scripture) so often bring in God speaking, let this and that be made, and after it was made? For certainly God then used no speech as when he spake to the Prophets. It is but a cold answer, that</hi> Moses <hi>did so write, that it might be signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied after a humane manner, that God made all things by his beck. For who doubts of that, or doth not indeed know, that to make the frame of the world God used no tools or engines? Besides, if that were the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, why is not also else-where God brought in using like speech, when he did some great work or miracle? I do no whit doubt but</hi> John <hi>had an eye on that place, when he termed Christ the Word, as if he had said, that Christ was pointed out by those expressions; He said, and it was made, although obscurely indeed, as befitted those times, even as also obscurely mention is made of the Holy Spirit, in the same chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, when</hi> Moses <hi>said, and the Spirit of God moved upon the waters. For indeed at first view he seems to speak of some wind and so the Chaldee Paraphrast expounded
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:62675:15"/>
that place. But because no reason can be given whence that wind should arise, or fit cause why it should move upon the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, men might be inclined to conjecture that</hi> Moses <hi>in that place had respect to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother thing. In the same manner plainly, sith no reason of so diligent and heedful an observation fit enough can be given, that God spake of each thing severally, Let it be made and it was made, there must be some mystery couched under those expressions: When therefore in the New Testament we are taught, that all things were made by Christ, let the Jews either open and explain to us that Mystery, or let them not shew themselves stiff in this matter. I confess indeed, that without the light of the Gospel, we should be hesitant here with the Jews; but sith Christ is call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Word, and said to be he by whom God made all things, no man hath any more cause of doubting left, but that</hi> Moses <hi>would intimate it by that diligent obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation which the words of the Psalmist,</hi> [Psal. 33. 6. 9. <hi>By the word of the Lord were the Heavens made, and all the host of them by the breath of his mouth: He spake and it was done, besides</hi> those word<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="3">3. The sense of the words in which the force of the argument consists is according to the plain and obvious use of the words and phrases; the other for the most part without example, and so streined, as that
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:62675:16"/>
it may easily be perceived, they studied rather to wrest, than to interpret them; as will appear by comparing the allegations and senses on both sides given in the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars as they are in order examined in the next Section.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The Adversaries acknowledge, that the intent of the Evangelist in that which is said of Christ, was to set out Christ in what he was singular, and was excellent in him: But to expound his words as they do, is to make the Evangelist deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver things common to him with others, as to say, <hi>in the beginning was the Word,</hi> that is, preaching the Gospel, or <hi>in the beginning</hi> of the preaching of the Gospel the Word Christ was, that is, had a being, that <hi>he was with God,</hi> that is, was known of God, is to say no more than might be said of <hi>John Baptist;</hi> to say he was with God to learn Mysteries is the same which St. <hi>Paul</hi> saith of himself, when he was rapt into Paradise, or is true of <hi>Moses</hi> when he conferred with God in the Mount; to say <hi>all things were made by him,</hi> that is, by his preaching the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles were become new creatures, is no more than might be said of <hi>Peter, Paul,</hi>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:62675:17"/>
and other Apostles; to say he was a God in office, that he had Divine Power to work Miracles, is to say no more of him than might be said of <hi>Moses,</hi> of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, nor do they or can they give any good reason, which may agree with the Majesty and Wisdom of so divine a writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Writer as this of <hi>John,</hi> to deliver things so obvious in so obscure Phrases, as are not congruous to a divine Historian, when the same might be, and were by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Evangelists delivered in plainer ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions; nor why he should prefix those sacred Aphorisms before his History, if they contained no Mystery, but things ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily perceivable by sense; nor is such an end, as is imagined by some, to shew that <hi>John Baptist</hi> was not the Messias, any thing probable to have been propounded by <hi>John</hi> the Evangelist, who wrote long after <hi>John Baptist</hi> was dead; nor could be, or was by any conceived to be the Christ: Such things as these can hardly be imputed to the Evangelist without some note of dotage.</p>
            <p n="5">5. To expound the words <hi>[in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning was the Word]</hi> that is, in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the preaching of the Gospel
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:62675:17"/>
was the Word, that is, Christ was preaching of the Gospel, or the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Gospel was, is more like an inept tautology of a trifler, than the holy, wise saying of a Divine Writer.</p>
            <p n="6">6. The sense given by the Adversaries is in sundry things not true; for in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the preaching of the Gospel Christ was not with God in Heaven, as they expound, <hi>verse</hi> 1. 2. his being with God, but was come from Heaven, and conversed familiarly with men; nor is it true, that in the beginning of the Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Gospel (be the beginning at <hi>John</hi>'s beginning to preach, or Christs, or his Apostles, or the continuing of it in the daies of his flesh) all things belonging to the new Creation, the new Covenant, the reconciling the world, the preaching and propagating of the Gospel were done by him. For the many Miracles of Christ were not done in the beginning of the Preaching of the Gospel, nor was his dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for us, nor the sending his Apostles, and their impowering by the coming of the Holy Ghost to them till after his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection and Ascention: Yea those men who expound the words, <hi>John 1. 3. All
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:62675:18"/>
things were done by him</hi> of divine and marvelous works, yet many divine mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velous works, as, the opening of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, the descent of the Spirit in the form of a Dove, the transfiguration and glory in the Mount, the rending the veil of the Temple, the Earthquake, cleaving the Rocks, opening the Graves, darkening of the Sun at his death, his Resurrection from the dead, they deny to have been done by Christ or the concurrence of his power or operation; nor is it true in their sense, that without him was nothing done that was done; For in the business of the preaching of the Gospel afore Christs ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestation to <hi>Israel, Iohn</hi> did preach and Baptize, and in the working of Miracles there were some that <hi>did cast out devils in Christs name, who followed not Christ, Luk.</hi> 9. 49. Nor is it true, that in their sense the world was made by Christ, that is the Gentiles reconciled by Christs Preaching or the world reformed; for that was done by the Apostles after his Ascention: And if it be said, that after Christs Ascention <hi>all things were done by him, that the world was made by him,</hi> that was not <hi>in the beginning,</hi> in which they say, <hi>he was
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:62675:18"/>
the Word,</hi> that is, did preach the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, <hi>was a God,</hi> that is, did work Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, <hi>was with God,</hi> that is, was taken up into heaven, and therefore the mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of all things, <hi>John</hi> 1. 3. cannot be understood according to their own exposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>[in the beginning]</hi> of Christs care in ordering and moderating all things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to his Church after his ascention, nor had any more been said of him as then done than may be said now, which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the adversaries grant, that some more than ordinary remarkable things is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated of Christ by St. <hi>John</hi> in the first verses of his Gospel: Whence may be justly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred that the Exposition given by them neither is consistent with the truth of things, nor the Evangelists words, nor their own sayings.</p>

<pb n="34" facs="tcp:62675:22"/>
Heaven and was <hi>the Word,</hi> that is, preached the Gospel, and then <hi>he was a God, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing endued with divine Power and Empire,</hi> to cast out Devils, and to do great works, as <hi>Moses</hi> did; whereas the first thing he sets down in the being of Christ in the beginning, and then his being with God, and his being God, and the making of all things by him, which can be applied in this order to no begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, but that of the Creation, and therefore <hi>[in the beginning]</hi> must be understood of the first Creation of all things, and not of the publishing the Gospel, as they would have it.</p>

That this being the Son of God, was such a thing as was not to be revealed by flesh and blood, but by his Father in Heaven, therefore it was not his being Gods Son, by the supernatural conception of the blessed Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, for that she could tell, both by her own knowledge of her Virginity, and the Angels revelation; nor by special mission, for that had been, but as one of the Prophets, as <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,</hi> and had been discernable by flesh and blood upon the sight of his great works, to which he often appealed, as demonstrating him to be sent of his Father as the Messiah, <hi>John</hi> 14. 10, 11. nor as Mediatour only; for then there had been no more acknowledged by <hi>Peters</hi> confessing him to be <hi>the Son of the living God,</hi> than by confessing him to be <hi>the Christ,</hi> therefore he was the Son of the liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God by generation of his Fathers Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance before the world was, which his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther onely could reveal. 2. This is further proved from these Texts of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture which make it the demonstration
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:62675:33"/>
of the greatest <hi>love of God in giving his on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly begotten Son,</hi> John 3. 16. <hi>not sparing his own Son, but giving him up for us all, Rom.</hi> 8. 32. But this had not been such a commendation of his love, if Christ had been only a supernaturally conceived man spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially commissionated as Mediatour, if he had not been the Son of God by generation before the world was, of his Fathers substance, it had not been more than the not sparing holy Angels but giving them for us; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he must be the Son of God, by such ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration of the Fathers substance, as he had before the world was. 3. <hi>Heb.</hi> 3. 4, 5, 6. our Lord Christ is preferred before <hi>Moses,</hi> as being a <hi>Son over his own house,</hi> and <hi>this house built by himself, who built all things,</hi> and therefore God, whereas <hi>Moses was but faithful as a Servant in Gods house,</hi> not his ow<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>As for that which is chiefly objected, that the reason of this title <hi>[the Son of God]</hi> given to Christ is from the peculiar Generation he had by the operation of the holy Ghost: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides that which is already said, that such a forming was of <hi>Adam</hi> at first, who was not the Son of God in that singular manner that Christ was, and if there were no other reason of his being the Son of God, but this, he should be termed peculiarly the Son of the

Spirit, whereas he is stiled the only begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten of the Father, it is said, <hi>that holy thing which shall be born of thee,</hi> intimates that what should be born of her was holy, and had being before that birth of the Virgin, and that his being called the <hi>Son of God,</hi> was not for that as the cause, at least not the sole cause, and that his being called the Son of God, was a consequent of being <hi>that holy thing, God with us,</hi> as it is <hi>Mat.</hi> 1. 23. The other Texts, <hi>John 10. 36. Acts 13. 33.

            <p>To which I reply. 1.

               <hi>Abraham,</hi> Christs speech might have been false, that he had seen <hi>Abraham:</hi> Yea, it had been nugatory, for Christ had said no more of himself than might be said by any of the Jews, that he was in Gods Decree before the calling of the Gentiles; and it had been also false, that <hi>before</hi> Abraham <hi>was</hi> Father of many Nations, Christ had a being, or was the light of the world, if he had no be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing afore his Incarnation, sith <hi>Abraham</hi> was Father of many Nations, <hi>Israelites, Ishma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And it had been delusory, and aenig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical to understand the words <hi>before</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham's <hi>being</hi> of the future time, when the objection was of his being long before; and to make the answer to be of <hi>Abraham</hi> under a spiritual consideration, when the objection was of him as the natural Progenitour of the Jews, and of Christ in respect of his Office or Imployment, when the objection was of his natural duration, which had been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to Christs manner of teaching, averring and vindicating his speeches: For though sometimes he answer obliquely, and teach
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:62675:37"/>
by consequences, leaving his auditors to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider his words, yet still his replies are solid, pertinent and convincing. And though the Exposition of some of them have no small difficulty, yet his speeches are not in such an aenigmatical and dark manner as this, by al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lusion to the Etymology or derivation of a Name, when other expressions were obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous: Besides, if Christ did at any time use such dark expressions or manner of answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, yet he cannot be conceived rightly to have done so in this answer, in which his preface, <hi>Verily, verily I say unto you,</hi> shews his answer to have been direct and plain, and was taken by the Jews in the sense import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his priority of Being, which Christ gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said not, and all Interpreters till this last age, have so expounded them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The words cannot by any instance of the like use of them be shewed to have the sense put on them.

I shall adde the words of Christ in his prayer to his Father, <hi>John 17. 5. And now, O Father, glorifie thou me with thine own self, with the glory which I had before the world was with thee;</hi> which words do evince, that Christ had glory with his Father before the world was, which is the description of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, <hi>Psal. 90. 2. Prov.</hi> 8. 23, 25. whence it follows, that before the world was, Christ had a Being in glory with his Father, which could be no other than his Divine Nature, as he was Son of God, and therefore is to be acknowledged to be begotten of the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of the Father before the world was.</p>
            <p>To this it is answered, that <hi>the glory</hi> here is not Divine Majesty, but glory of immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality and honour to him as man, such glory as <hi>was given to him, verse</hi> 24. and which he saith <hi>he had given to his Disciples, ver.</hi> 22. as it is said, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 9. that <hi>God had saved them, and called them with an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly calling, not according to their works, but according to his own purpose and grace, which was given them in Christ Jesus, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the world began;</hi> to wit in Gods pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destination. And in the same respect the Apostle saith, 2 <hi>Cor. 5. 1. We have a building of God, an house not made with
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:62675:39"/>
hands eternal in the Heavens,</hi> Heb. 10. 34. That <hi>they had in Heaven a better and endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring substance,</hi> in the sense in which Christ is said to be <hi>fore-ordained before the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the world, 1 Pet.</hi> 1. 20. to be <hi>the Lamb s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>To which I reply that it is somewhat dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult to explain what the glory is with which Christ prayes his Father to glorifie him, and how he would have him glorifie him, by reason of the various meanings of the term <hi>glory</hi> and waies of Gods glorifying. The Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition implies it was such glory as he had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the world was, now had not: This may be best understood by considering how he had it with the Father before the world was? Two waies are conceived, one by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual possession, the other by predestination or fore-ordaining: For the former, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the latter are these Reasons. 1. From the tense, <hi>[which I had]</hi> in the preterimper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect tense, which if meant of having in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose only it should be, <hi>which I have with thee,</hi> sith Gods purpose or fore-appointment was still the same. 2. Which reason is
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:62675:40"/>
strengthened from the time, <hi>now glorifie me,</hi> which intimates he had it not then; but he was then glorified in purpose. 3. <hi>Before the World was,</hi> which shews when he had it, and how he would have it again, but he doth not petition to have it again only in purpose, but in actual possession. 4. He desires that he may have that glory <hi>with his Father's own self. which he had with him:</hi> Now <hi>with his Father's own self,</hi> in the one part must be meant of his Presence, and that in Heaven, as when it is said, 1 <hi>John 2. 1.

But if this exposition of the Title <hi>[the first born of every Creature]</hi> be not received, but that it note only Christs dominion or inheritance of every creature, yet will this sense prove his Generation before all Creatures, and his being exempt from the rank of creatures, sith the reason of his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>the first-born of every creature,</hi> and so Lord or Heir of them, is <hi>ver. 16.

that was assimilated, or made like unto God in holiness; in such holiness as he require in the New Covenant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I reply. 1. This Reason is given without proof, and if allusion be to <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 29. nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it said there that Christ is the first-born by reason of his assimilation to God in holiness before others, nor is the Image of Christ, to which others are conformed, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed to be in qualities, it is more likely to be in estate and condition, to wit, of glory.</p>

               <p>The Exception against the Argument from <hi>Acts 2. 30. Rom. 1. 3, 4. Rom.</hi> 9. 5. is set down.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>AGainst this it is thus excepted: <hi>When the Apostle saith, that Christ came of the Fathers according to the flesh, who is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver all a God blessed for ever; the opposition is not entire and exact as wanting the other Member: What that Member is, another passage of the Apostle, wherein you have the same opposition in describing Christ, will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form you; It is</hi> Rom. 1. 3, 4. <hi>concerning his Son Jesus Christ our Lord, who was made (or rather born) of the seed of</hi> Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid <hi>according to the flesh, and declared to be the Son of God with Power</hi> (Gr. <hi>deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, or ordained Son of God in Power) according to the Spirit of Holiness, by the Resurrection from the dead: Here you see that to those words, according to the flesh, are opposed these, according to the Spirit of Holiness: Again, What this Spirit of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness is, will be no hard matter to find out,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:62675:75"/>
if we consider that as the flesh signifyeth a constituting part of Christ, namely his flesh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly body; so also must the Spirit of holiness, opposed thereunto, signifie a constituting part: If so, then it is not the holy Spirit, as every one will confesse, nor the reasonable soul of Christ, because he is intimated to have had this Spirit by means of the resurrection from the dead, whereas he had a reasonable Soul before his death: Nor the Divine Nature, for that is no where in Scripture designed by the name of Spirit, or Spirit of holiness: Besides, the adversaries hold, that Christ had the Divine<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> Nature, whilst he was yet cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with flesh. It remains therefore that by the Spirit of holiness, which Christ had by means of the resurrection of the dead, and is a constituting part of him, is to be understood his Holy, Spiritual Body, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he is excepted from other men, being the first-born from the dead, or the first that so rose from the dead, as that he never dyed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, but was cloathed with a Spiritual body, and made like to God, who is a Spirit. And now the sense of that passage beginneth to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear,</hi> Heb. 9. 14. <hi>How much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi> (Gr. <hi>through an eternal Spirit, for no

Article is prefixed) offered himself without spot to God; Purge your consciences from dead works to serve the living God? By eternal Spirit is here meant the spiritual bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Christ, which lasteth to all eternity; and this expression is opposed to what the same Divine Authour speaketh of Christ,</hi> Heb. 5. 7. <hi>who in the daies of his flesh,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>For eternal is contrary to dayes, and spirit to flesh: Neither will that which we have here spoken seem strange to him, who having pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrated into that profound Epistle to the Hebrews, knoweth (what is there frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly intimated) that Christ then made his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering for our sins; when, after his Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, he entered into Heaven, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing endued with a spiritual and immortal Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, presented himself before God: For so the Type of the Levitical High-Priest mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the yearly Atonement for the si<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="142" facs="tcp:62675:76"/>
and Glory, he entered into Heaven, the true Sanctuary, and presented himself to God. (Wherefore to return to the foresaid passage,</hi> Rom. 9. 5.) <hi>When it is there said, of whom according to the flesh (for so the Greek hath it) Christ came, who is over all a God to be blessed for ever; we ought (by the authority of the Apostle himself) to supply in our mind the other member of the opposition, and to understand the place, as if it had been said; who according to the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of holiness by the Resurrection from the dead, is over all a God blessed for ever: But if Christ be according to the Spirit of Holiness by the Resurrection from the dead</hi> (that is) <hi>according to his spiritual Body, which he received by means of the Resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction from the dead the Son of God in Power, and accordingly a God over all; he is not the Son of God in Power, and accordingly a God over all, by having the Divine Nature per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonally united to his Humane Nature, but by the Glorification and Exaltation of his v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="185" facs="tcp:62675:97"/>
the essence of a Servant, no more than the essence of a man, if his <hi>taking the form of a Servant had</hi> been by <hi>being made a man:</hi> Besides the nature of man is not the essence of a Servant; man may be Lord as Christ man <hi>is Lord of all, Acts</hi> 10. 36. and yet hath the essence of man, and Angels are Servants and yet have not the essence of man. 2. It is said, Christ <hi>emptied himself, to wit, of the form of God in which he was,</hi> which notes some lessening or laying aside of the form of God, in wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>ch he was; But that could not be the Divine essence, therefore it is not here meant.</p>
            <p>Nor is it to be conceived, that by <hi>the form of God</hi> is meant the power of doing Miracles: For neither is the power of Miracles any where termed the <hi>form of God,</hi> and if that were all that is meant, it might be said of <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> that <hi>they were in the form of God:</hi> Besides he did not empty himself of the power or exercise of it whereby he did Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles at any time, no not when he was appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended, for even then the Souldiers at his word <hi>went backward and fell to the Earth, John</hi> 18. 6. and he restored <hi>Malch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <pb n="186" facs="tcp:62675:98"/>
Therefore it is more likely that by <hi>form of God</hi> is meant the state or Majesty of God, <hi>that glory which he had with his Father be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the world was, John</hi> 17. 5. the Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise of his Empire, which he had opposite to the state of a Servant which he took, and to the obedience which he yielded to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>ver.</hi> 7, 8. For the estate of God is an estate of Empire and Command exercising Power and Dominion, giving of gifts to friends, helping Subjects, subduing Enemies, which Christ did with the Father before he took flesh, but emptied himself of it in his humiliation: which is the more confirmed in that his superexaltation, <hi>verse</hi> 9. restored that which he emptied himself of: Now that was his Glory and Majesty, all things being made subject to him. And this seems best to agree with the use of the term <hi>form,</hi> as here it seems to be used: For as the <hi>form of a Servant</hi> notes that which made him appear to others to be under the command of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to wit, of his Father, which was <hi>that he should lay down his life and take it again, John</hi> 10. 18. which was undoubtedly conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous to the Angels, and also to those who knew him to be the Son of God; So <hi>the form of God</hi> notes that Majesty, Glory, exercise of
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:62675:98"/>
Empire which he had with his Father, which was apparent to the Holy Angels, and to <hi>Abraham</hi> who <hi>saw his day,</hi> and to <hi>Jacob</hi> and other holy persons afore his Incarnation, and is the same with his being <hi>as God,</hi> or <hi>equal to God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. From hence then we may understand what is meant by <hi>his being in the form of God,</hi> to wit his possession and enjoyment of that <hi>glory he had with his Father before the world was, John</hi> 17. 5. <gap reason="foreign">

            <p n="2">2. <hi>The Apostle speaketh of our Lord as a man, in that he giveth him the Titles of Christ Jesus, both which agree to him onely as a man: For he is called Jesus as he was a child conceived of the Holy Spirit in the Virgins womb, and brought forth by her,</hi> Luke 1. 27, 30, 31, 35. <hi>and Christ signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth the anointed,</hi> John 1. 41. <hi>and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly Jesus is expressly called the Christ of God,</hi> Luke 9. 20. <hi>But he was anointed (as the Adversaries themselves will confesse) as a man, and not as God;</hi> See <hi>Acts</hi> 10. 38.</p>

not have said, that Christ became in the likeness of men, and was found in fashion as a man: For if men (as the Adversaries must hold, when they alledge this place to prove that Christ assumed a Humane Na<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>I answer hereto, that <hi>likeness</hi> agrees to substance or essence, and not only to qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity or condition, and that in neither of the places alledged <hi>men</hi> is taken for <hi>men as ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,</hi> is shewed before: If this objection were of force it would prove Christ was made not a really weak man, but in the likeness or fashion of weak men, if <hi>[men]</hi>
               <pb n="218" facs="tcp:62675:114"/>
be considered not as men, but as weak and abject men, <hi>Philip.</hi> 2. 7, 8. which it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd the Objector to have heeded as well as the Adversaries: Notwithstanding then this Objection <hi>men</hi> and <hi>man, Phil.</hi> 2. 7, 8. may and must be understood of humane Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence and Nature, not restrainedly as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied only to men of a vulgar, ordinary, low or weak condition, and Christ hence prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be Incarnate, and to have both Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, Divine and Humane.</p>
            <p>Other Arguments against the understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by <hi>the form of God</hi> the condition or state of Empire, which Christ had with his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther before his Incarnation are in the <hi>first part of the disputation of</hi> Josue Placeus <hi>of</hi> Saumur <hi>concerning the Arguments by which it is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced Christ to have been before his concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, disp. 5th. out of Philip.</hi> 2. 6. Â§. 18. in these words, <hi>yet in very deed the form of God seems not to us to be placed in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding: For we dare not affirm that God was not in that infinite time, in which he liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed blessed before any creature was made, in the form of God; But neither also dare we deny that he shall be in the form of God af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the last day, in which time perhaps there will be no need, that he command the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures:

He is no less in the form of God when he ceaseth from commanding, then when he commands as a King sitting on his Throne attended by his Guard, Crowned with Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty and Glory, is in the form of a King, even when he commands nothing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To which I answer, if <hi>[the form of God]</hi> noted only the essence of God, not the state and appearance, it might as well be said of Christ, when he did not rule as well as when he did, when he shall not as well as when he shall, that <hi>he was in the form of God:</hi> But sith the term <hi>emptying himself</hi> notes a diminution in something of what he was, and this is expressed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

the state and appearance of <hi>being God as God,</hi> or <hi>equal to God</hi> in his Rule, though it presuppose the essence of God which he had; And he might empty himself of the form of God in this sense, it being only a relative condition supervenient to his essence from the respect to subjects to be ruled, which might be taken or laid aside without alteration in essence: As the assumption of an humane body, contract with his Father, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 9. are ascribed to the second Person in the God-head peculiarly without subtraction from, or addition to his essence as God: So we say, that Christ is Mediatour accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to both Natures, so as to interceed with his Father according to his Divine Nature, and this had a beginning and shall have an end, and yet his Divine Essence invariable. As for the similitude of a King as it is used, it is not apposite to the point: The King on his Throne that is guarded hath some to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand; Yet if he do not Rule, but only be in the Gesture, and wear the Habit, and hold the Ensigns of a Ruler, may be said to be in the Habit, not in the Form of a King; as he that hath the Place and Cloaths of a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant doth not take the Form of a Servant, without taking the Work of a Servant,
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:62675:115"/>
although he be in the Habit of Ã  Servant.</p>
            <p>It is added Â§. 19. <hi>It is indeed Divine to command, not to command simply, but ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually to rule all things: For Masters, and Lords, and Magistrates command also: Yea to command seems not to belong to God as God, but as he is Lord: There is some difference between God and Lord; For from all Eternity God was actually God, but he seems not to have been actually Lord, but when he had Servants or Subjects, to wit Creatures: For it is known that a Lord and a Servant are relatives, whose nature is that they exist together in time; But al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it be a Divine thing to command, yet not whatsoever is Divine is the Form of God. Â§. 20. For Form is conceived as some permanent thing to command as a transe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>nt action: Form as something absolute inherent in the thing informed, to command as an action passing from the Commander to another: Form as that by which the thing is that which it is; Inward indeed as that by which the th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>ng is such essentially, but out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward as that by which the thing is what out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly appears: But to command neither is that by which God is God, neither as that by which he is such as he appears to bÃ©.</hi>
               <pb n="222" facs="tcp:62675:116"/>
Lastly, <hi>a form is conceived as that which is before action, for the inward produceth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, the outward the manner of the action: For each thing acts according to its form, and the actions of a King are wont to be agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the form of a King, of a Servant to the form of a Servant, of a Merchant to the form of a Merchant, and so in others: To command therefore is an action agreeing to the form of God, not the form of God it self: Otherwise Christ had in like sort taken and deposed the form of God; taken it as oft as he commanded either Diseases or Devils, or the Sea, deposed it as often as he ceased from commanding: To end, Is it not manifest, that the Apostles words</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>existing or when he was in the form of God, signifies a state or condition, not action; a state I say in which he then was when he emtied himself, and which by emtying himself either he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed or hid, the form of a Servant being ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To which I answer, If the word <hi>[Form]</hi> note a <hi>state or condition,</hi> as it is granted, and the term <hi>[form of a Servant]</hi> also im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies; and it be <hi>a Divine thing to command or rule all things,</hi> then by these grants it may well be expounded <hi>[he was in the
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:62675:116"/>
form of God]</hi> that is, in the state or condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of an Emperour, or co-ruler with his Father; which being a relative state, he might empty himself of, as he may of the state of Mediatour (which yet belongs to his Divine Nature) as being a distinct Person from the Father, although consubstantial or co-essential; And this state and condition he actually had as soon as any creature was made, the Divine Essence he had afore a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny creature was, but the form of God, when there was; and it might be termed the form by which he appeared to be God, <hi>by whom and for whom all things visible and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visible were created, Col.</hi> 1. 16. though not a permanent or absolute form, as <hi>the form of a Servant</hi> is so termed though not a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent, or absolute state, or the form of a King or Merchant, as he speaks: Which being rightly understood answers the four things, by which Â§. 40. he takes it that he hath proved <hi>the form of God to be the Divine Essence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For, 1. Saith he, <hi>In what form of God could he be Lord afore he was made a man, but in the very Nature and Divine Essence?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To which I answer, In none, yet the
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:62675:117"/>
form notes not the Essence of God but the State or Condition of a Lord or Commander, as the form of a Servant notes not the Essence or Nature of a Man, but the state or condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Servant, although he were so in no other Nature, than that of a Man.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Saith he, <hi>In the Nature of God it self sith he is most simple, the external form cannot be separated from the internal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> This I suppose is not true, he had the internal Form or Essence of God afore he was Creatour, and shall have it when he shall cease to be actual Judge of all.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Saith he, <hi>The truth of this form proves it: For that form of God in which Christ was, was either the true form of God, or the false: If the false, Christ was a false God, which even to pronounce my mind abhors: If true, it was not severed from the internal, and essential Form of God: For what the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal form of any thing as of Gold or Silver without the inward, that is commonly called false.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To which I answer; It was the true form of God, and yet might be severed, as the form of a Mediatour or actual Judge of all: Nor is his proof right; For though that which hath the outward form without the inward be
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:62675:117"/>
alse, yet that which hath the inward with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the outward may be true, as Gold and Silver covered with dirt or drosse, as it is in Mines afore it is refinened, is true Gold or Silver, though the outward form be want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Saith he, <hi>The equality of Christ with God proves it: For the external form of God separated from the internal, if any can be, makes him not equal to God, as neither the outward and appearing form of a King alone, makes one equal to a King.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> That <hi>being in the form of God,</hi> Christ was <hi>equal to God,</hi> or <hi>as God,</hi> may be gathered from the Text, <hi>Philip.</hi> 2. 6. But not, that <hi>the form of God makes him e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual to God,</hi> which therefore may be though <hi>the form of God</hi> be laid afide for a time. <hi>Plaeceus</hi> himself in the same place, <hi>Sect.</hi> 24. saith, <hi>when therefore Christ was in the form of God, equal to God, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
