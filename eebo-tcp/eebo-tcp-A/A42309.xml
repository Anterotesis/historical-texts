         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>An exact Account of the new Well lately found out at <hi>Iſling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THe New Well at <hi>Iſlington</hi> is a certain Spring in the middle of a Garden, belonging to the Muſick Houſe, Built by Mr. — <hi>Sadler,</hi> on the North-ſide of the Great Ciſtern that receives the New River Water near <hi>Iſlington,</hi> the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter whereof was before the Reformation, very much famed for ſeveral extraordinary Cures performed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, and was thereupon accounted ſacred, and called <hi>Holy-Well.</hi> The Prieſts belonging to the Priory of <hi>Clarken-well</hi> uſing to attend there, made the People believe that the vertues of the Waters pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded from the efficacy of their Prayers. But upon the Reformation the Well was ſtopt up, upon a ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition that the frequenting it was altogether Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious, and ſo by degrees it grew out of remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, and was wholly loſt until found out, and the Fame of it revived again by the following acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Sadler</hi> being made Surveyor of the High Ways, and having good Gravel in his own Garden, employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed two Men to Dig there, and when they had Dug, pretty deep, one of them found his Pickax ſtrike upon ſome thing that was very hard<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whereupon he
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:94134:3"/>
indeavoured to break it, but could not; whereupon thinking with himſelf that it might peradventure be ſome Treaſure hid there, he uncovered it very carefully<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and found it to be a Broad Flat Stone; which having looſened and lifted up, he ſaw it was ſupported by four Oaken Poſts, and had under it a large Well of Stone Arched over, and curiouſly carved; and having view<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it, he called his fellow Labourer to ſee it likewiſe, and asked him whether they ſhould fetch Mr. <hi>Sadler</hi> and ſhew it him? Who having no kindneſs for <hi>Sadler</hi> ſaid, no; he ſhould not know of it, but as they had found it, ſo they would ſtop it up again, and take no notice of it; which he that found it conſented to at firſt, but after a little time he found himſelf (whether out of Curioſity or for ſome other reaſon, I ſhall not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine) ſtrongly inclined to tell <hi>Sadler</hi> of the Well; which he did one Sabbath Day in the Evening.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sadler</hi> upon this went down to ſee the Well and obſerving the Curioſity of the Stone work, that was about it, and fancying within himſelf that it was a Medicinal Water, formerly had in great eſteem, but by ſome accident or other loſt, he took ſome of it in a Bottle, and carryed it to an Eminent Phyſician, tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling him how the Well was found out, and deſiring his Judgment of the Water; who having taſted and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it, told him it was very ſtrong of a Mineral taſte, and adviſed him to Brew ſome Beer with it, and carry it to ſome Perſons, to whom he would recommend him; which he did accordingly. And ſome of thoſe who uſed to have it of him in Bottles, found ſo much good by it, that they defired him to bring it in Round<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets. Which was done moſt part of the laſt Winter, and continued to have ſo good an effect upon the Perſons that drank it, that at the beginning of this
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:94134:3"/>
Summer Dr. <hi>Morton</hi> adviſed ſeveral of his Patients to drink the Water. Which has ſo good an effect up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, and operates ſo near <hi>Tunbridg</hi> Water, that it has obtained a general approbation. And great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of thoſe who uſed to go thither, drink it, There are few Phyſicians in <hi>London,</hi> but have adviſed ſome or other of their Patients to drink it; by which means it is ſo frequented, that there are Five or ſix Hundred People there conſtantly every Morning.</p>
            <p>The Water has a kind of Ferruginous Taſte, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what like <hi>Tunbridge,</hi> but not altogether ſo ſtrong of the Steel. It is no way offenſive or unpleaſant; ſo that a Man may drink more of it than he can poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly drink of any other Liquor. It is not yet certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly known what Minerals it runneth through, but is ſuppoſed to partake of ſeveral, and to have more of a Nitrous Sulphur than thoſe of <hi>Tunbridg,</hi> for which reaſon it moves the Perſon who drinks it to ſtool at the firſt taking, &amp; leaves the Body Open &amp; Cool, which the other does not; and where it meets with a very foul Stomach, provokes to vomit.</p>
            <p>It appears to be good for the following Diſtempers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt it effectually opens all Obſtructions, both of the Liver, Spleen and Gall, and that better than any other Phyſick whatſoever; for in regard Obſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are generally very ſtubborn, and require a long Courſe of Phyſick to remove them, which is both loathſome, and chargeable to the Patient, 'tis common for people to grow weary of it before the Phyſician have half run through the courſe, which is neceſſary for the removing of them; which is the chief reaſon that ſo many are troubled with Chronical, and Linge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Diſeaſes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which are not incurable in their own Nature, but made ſo, either by the Patients not being
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:94134:4"/>
able, or willing to undergo ſuch a courſe of Phyſick, as is requiſite for his Recovery, or elſe ſome defect in the Phyſician. But theſe Waters being leſs Chargea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and after a little uſe no way troubleſome, but the longer they are uſed, the pleaſanter, may be taken in a larger quantity than other Phyſick, and by that means effectually cure the moſt obſtinate Obſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and all other Diſtempers proceeding therefrom; to wit, the Dropſy, Black and Yellow Jaundice, Swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the Spleen, Scurvy, Green Sickneſs, and other Diſtempers incident to the Female Sex.</p>
            <p>Secondly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> It excellently purges and ſweetens the Blood, and ſcowrs and cleanſes all the Urinary Paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, which makes it exceeding good for thoſe trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with Gravel and Stone, either in the Kidneys, Ureters, or Bladder, which it ſometimes brings away in great Quantities; and being ſomewhat of a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtringent, and Healing Faculty, it's very good for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Ulcers, and thoſe that make bloody Urine.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, It's good againſt all inveterate Dyſente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, or Bloody Fluxes, and extinguiſhes all inward In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammations, and hot Diſtempers.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, It is extraordinary good for thoſe who are troubled with Hypochondriacal Melancholy, and makes thoſe who drink it brisk and cheerful.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, It procures a good Appetite, and makes thoſe who drink it, extream hungry, ſo that they can hardly forbear eating till Dinner. But that thoſe Perſons who drink them, may not fail of the good they expect from them, they muſt take heed that they be very careful and regular when they take them, and eſpecially to obſerve the following Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
            <p>Go to them early in the morning; for the ſooner
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:94134:4"/>
they are drank, the better they operate. Beware of walking too faſt, leſt you overheat your ſelf, and if ye find your ſelf hot when you come there, take a turn or two in the Garden, till you are a little cooler, and then drink two Glaſſes, after which walk two or three times round the Garden, then drink a Glaſs or two; walk again as formerly, and ſo continue till you have drank your doſe. You may adventure to drink four or five Glaſſes the firſt morning, and increaſe two eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day, till you come to 9 or 10, or more, if you find your Body will bear it. Eat nothing till about twelve or one a clock, and then eat freely of any Freſh Meat; but Roaſt Mutton, or Lamb is beſt.</p>
            <p>Thoſe who pleaſe may eat Carraways while they drink the Water, and drink a glaſs of Rheniſh, or White-Wine after them: And it is very convenient for thoſe who ſmoke Tobacco, to take a Pipe or two whileſt their Waters work.</p>
            <p>Which Directions being obſerved, you may aſſure your ſelves, by the bleſſing of God, to reap great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage by the uſe of theſe Waters, if ye continue to drink them for any conſiderable time.</p>
