         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE
READER.</head>
            <p>WEre there no Genteeler Language, nor more decent
<hi>Schemes</hi> of Speech to Address <hi>thee</hi> in, than those
used by Mr. <hi>Alsop,</hi> I should not be so unmanner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and Rude, nor so far both disparage and affront
<hi>thee,</hi> as to bid <hi>thee</hi> welcome by a <hi>Preface,</hi> to the Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
which thou wilt find here provided. For as no man
<hi>writes</hi> a <hi>Book,</hi> who would not be Glad to have <hi>Guests,</hi> that
might with a distinguishing <hi>Gust,</hi> and a digestive <hi>Appetite,</hi>
be both ready and desirous to partake of the <hi>Viands,</hi> which
he hath dress'd for them; so it is but a peice of Decency and
Good Breeding, to meet them Civilly at the <hi>Door,</hi> and to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce
them in a Comely and Respectful manner. And whoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
receives them after a <hi>Jeering</hi> Fashion, cannot be thought
to design the making a <hi>Treat,</hi> but to Gratify his own <hi>Splene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick</hi>
Distemper, in the obtaining an occasion to <hi>Laugh.</hi> Nor
did ever a Person of the most Ordinary <hi>Discretion,</hi> set a <hi>Buf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foon,</hi>
or <hi>a</hi> Merry Andrew at his <hi>Gate,</hi> to bestow the Recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
and Welcoming <hi>Complement</hi> upon his Friends whom
he had invited; whatsoever use he might make of those <hi>Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi>
afterwards, in order to give <hi>Diversion,</hi> and raise <hi>Mirth.</hi>
Which nevertheless is the <hi>method,</hi> that either Mr. <hi>Alsop</hi>'s
Education or Malady, have influenced him to take, in the
<hi>Accosting</hi> of his <hi>Reader.</hi> Seeing besides the downright <hi>Buf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foonry</hi>
that Glares him in the face, through his telling
him, <hi>That it may serve for his Mortification in some de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree,
that he is postpon'd, from the Preface to the Post<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>script,
<pb facs="tcp:62502:3"/>
from the Van to the Rear, and that he who has
commonly pretended to Ride in State on the Fore-Horse,
is degraded to come behind with the Portmanteu.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>All the rest of the Courtship which he thinks him wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of, is perfectly Clownish,</hi> Fantastick <hi>and Foppish;</hi>
namely, <hi>That it ought not to make him proud, that he is
Caressed, Complemented, and Addressed by the Scribling
Tribe, and made the Judge of Life and Death to every Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
that shall dare to look abroad into the publick: For,</hi>
says he, <hi>it may serve to humble thee, that what carries the
Appearance of Honour, is, if well considered, a Real
Burthen, to be surcharged with the common Titles of the
Judicious and Learned, the Courteous and Candid, the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial
and Indifferent, and whatever other goodly Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thets
a Wretched Cause may need, or a Fruitful Inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
produce, either to blind his Judgment, or bribe his
Affections, p. 243. of his</hi> Vind<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of the Faithful Reb. The
whole whereof, as it is Pedantick and Boarish; so if I know a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thing of the Rules of Conversation, and of the Measures
of Civility, it is to dress up his <hi>Reader</hi> in a <hi>Yellow Coat,</hi>
and then to point at him as an Object of Derision and Ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cule.
But there being great diversity of <hi>Stiles,</hi> and a wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Variety, as well as Copiousness of Words and Terms, no
Person that is vertuous and well-bred, can be under a necessity
of Accosting an other in <hi>Phrases</hi> Learned at the <hi>Plough</hi> and
<hi>Harrow,</hi> or which are borrowed from a <hi>Jack-pudding</hi> on the
<hi>Mountebanck Stage.</hi> However, Reader, thou wilt have the
less cause to be offended at Mr. <hi>Alsop's</hi> Pedantick, Foppish and
Buffoonry way of application to thee, when thou observest that
he not only treateth all others of whatsoever Quality or Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
they be, after the same <hi>Childish</hi> and <hi>Ridiculous</hi> man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner;
but in what a <hi>Ludicrous</hi> way he speaks of the Eternal
Counsels of God, and of the Great Articles of the Christian
Faith. For it being his <hi>Top</hi> Accomplishment and his pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly
<pb facs="tcp:62502:3"/>
distinguishing <hi>Talent,</hi> to turn every thing he writes of
into <hi>Droll</hi> and <hi>Laughter;</hi> it were to expect he should cease to
be, what thro' Genius, Manners, and Custom, he Prides him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to have attained unto, to think he should Address his
<hi>Reader</hi> in other Terms, than in such which serve to make a
<hi>jest</hi> of him. It may seem indeed difficult, how to make any
words Ministerial to a cleanly, modest, and grave purpose; after
he hath thus Transposed, perverted, and Debauched them into
Subserviency to Foppishness, Drollery, and Buffoonry; but even
that is not altogether Impracticable, seeing words taken singly
and apart, are neither good nor bad, but the Benefit or Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheif
by them lyes in their Texture, Vse, and Application. For
the very same <hi>Terms,</hi> which thro' being brought into one kind
of <hi>Association,</hi> Express nothing but Smuttiness, Ribaldry,
or very Boarish Thoughts; yet being otherwise Regimented and
Marshal'd into sentences, they serve to declare the Noblest
Conceptions, and in the handsomest and cleanliest manner. In
a word it is the Meaness and Impurity; or the Loftiness and
Innocency of the <hi>Thought;</hi> which guides to Language, that
is unsullied, grateful, and stately; or unto that which is nasty,
distastful, and Beggarly. Now reader, tho' I do forbear giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thee the Titles of <hi>Judicious, Learned, Courteous, Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did,</hi>
&amp;c. Least thou should'st believe that thro' repeating Mr.
<hi>Alsop</hi>'s <hi>Terms,</hi> I do it upon the desi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> all which I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took,

which is Monstrous and Deformed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:62502:4"/>
And indeed my bringing him forth, and exposing of him, was
not to raise <hi>Laughter</hi> in the <hi>Spectators,</hi> but Loathing and Indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</p>
            <p>And as it was upon those Motives, and thro' an Exercise of
those Passions in my self, that I have led him about to be seen
and View'd; so I shall attain a great part of my Desire and Aim
by the doing of it, if all People will but fall into my Sentiments,
and accordingly declare their Resentments. However it is not
the <hi>Minister</hi> I have Rebuk'd or had to do with, but the <hi>Man,</hi>
who hath forgot as well as disgraced his <hi>Function.</hi> His think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that his <hi>Office</hi> should pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>tect him in Writing Impiously and
with Scurrility, doth but make his Chastizement both the more
necessary and just. And what Enhanceth his Crime, is not to be
Admitted as a Plea and Excuse for his Escaping Punishment.
Nor were any thing more Incongruous, than to favour him upon
the Account of his <hi>Character,</hi> when he himself has Practically
Renounced it. Had it been some <hi>Lay Droll,</hi> or one avowedly
Prophane, who had Written in the manner that he hath done, he
had Acted but answerably to the <hi>Badge</hi> he wears; and it would at
most have only Declared him an Enemy of, and a <hi>Rebel</hi> against
the Laws of our Holy Religion; but for a <hi>Preacher</hi> of the <hi>Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel</hi>
to do it, is to Fight against the Crown and Dignity of his
Master, under the Authority of a Commission from himself; so
that he is not only to be accounted and pursued as an <hi>Enemy</hi> and
a <hi>Rebel,</hi> but as a <hi>Traytor</hi> to both. In a Word, all that can be
thought severe here upon Mr. <hi>Alsop</hi> doth only touch his <hi>Person,</hi>
and no ways his <hi>Office.</hi> It being the <hi>Buffoon</hi> and <hi>Player</hi> whom
I have only had to do with, and not the <hi>Pastor</hi> or <hi>Parson.</hi> And
that which would have Justified a greater Severity than I have
used towards Mr. <hi>Alsop,</hi> is not only because of the <hi>Stile</hi> in which
he hath Written; but by reason of his having had the Vanity to
say to divers of his Friends upon the Publishing of his last Book,
<hi>that he had Ground Mr.</hi> Lobb <hi>to Powder, and if it proved
not so, he would be contented to be Pounded into Dust him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:62502:4"/>
Which tho I will not have the Haughtiness and Folly to
Affirm that he is; yet I will venture to give my Opinion, that
he not only Sung an <hi>Epinikion</hi> and <hi>Panegyrick</hi> too soon over his
fancied <hi>Achievements,</hi> and supposed Victory; but that it is by this
time apparent, he may be better credited in the Quality of a <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sager</hi>
and <hi>Prophet,</hi> of the Fate and Destiny which did await him,
than he is to be believed as an <hi>Historian of the Conquests</hi>
which he had made.</p>
            <p>Nor do I, Reader, beg thy <hi>Favour</hi> in Relation to any thing
of my own, that thou wilt here meet with; but all that I do
crave, is thy <hi>Impartiality;</hi> which the vouchsafing, is but to do
Right and Justice to thy self, if thou shouldst grudg to do them
to me. And the less thou hast of Prepossession, Factious Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices,
intemperate Heats, Ignorance, Immorality and Ill-breeding;
and the more thou hast of Learning, Generous E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducation,
and of Social, as well as of Christian Virtues, the
more readily do I submit, both my self, and what I have here
written, unto thee, as unto a Competent Judg. And tho I
have not the Vanity to expect from thee Applause or Reward,
yet without injury to thy self, thou canst not avoid giving it
as thy Sentential Opinion, that it was needful upon many ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts,
that this should have been done, and that the only thing
to be regretted, is, that it was not undertaken by a Better Hand,
and perform'd with greater Accuracy and Exactness. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto

            <p>THough the Preaching of the Word of God, the
Administration of the Holy Sacraments, and
whatsoever else properly belongeth to the Pasto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral

to stand vested in, and to be confined, and
circumscrib'd unto those of the <hi>Ecclesiastical Order;</hi> unless in
some cases of Absolute and Indispensable necessity; yet the
Care and Defence both of the <hi>Credenda</hi> and <hi>Agenda</hi> of our
Religion, being made, and constituted the <hi>Peculiar</hi> of no
one Rank of Men, to the Exclusion of the rest, it would
therefore be no Invasion upon the Province of such as are
Stiled <hi>Divines,</hi> should one, who (besides his being a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian)
pretendeth to no Title or Character save that of a
<hi>Gentleman,</hi> assume the Liberty of Engaging in your <hi>Theolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical
Disputes.</hi> And seeing those of the <hi>Laity</hi> so called, are sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
to be less Addicted to Parties, and Factions, and more
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:62502:6"/>
fortifyed against Impressions from secular and worldly In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terests,
than <hi>some</hi> of the <hi>Clergy</hi> are Apprehended, or found
to be; they may thereupon be thought Qualified to think
with more calmness, to write with greater Temperance, and
to Determine with less Partiality, than we sometimes see
practised in the <hi>Polemicks</hi> of the <hi>latter.</hi> Yea, considering
with what Undecency, Rudeness and Scurrility, <hi>Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versies</hi>
about the <hi>Doctrinals</hi> of our <hi>Faith,</hi> have been lately
managed by a certain <hi>Presbyterian Thologue,</hi> it is become not
only pardonable and lawful, but in a manner necessary,
to have them undertaken by Persons of another <hi>Tribe;</hi>
whose Civil Breeding and <hi>Social</hi> Vertues, will guide them
to Discourse and Write with Modesty and Good manners,
tho they may not do it with that <hi>Sophistry,</hi> and in those
Terms of Scholastick <hi>Squabble,</hi> which are Affected by such,
who set up for, and do value themselves upon the <hi>Leger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demain</hi>
Knacks and Tricks of killing their Adversaries, and
triumphing over their Reputation, when they have neither
wounded nor touched them. Nor can any thing be more
desireable, or worthy of Greater Commendation, than to
have Differences, whether greater, or Lesser about Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
matters, contrasted, and transacted with such a
spirit of meekness and humility, and in that Innocent, Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate
and cleanly stile, as may not only Proclaim an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuous
Education, but be Ornamental to the Gospel; and
not with a virulence, clounishness and ribaldry, savouring
of a <hi>Bear-Garden,</hi> and which would be both Detested and
thought Punishable in <hi>Carmen, Porters,</hi> and in those at
<hi>Billingsgate,</hi> who are <hi>Proverbial</hi> for all that is unmannerly
and Brutal. For to whatsoever degrees of Laziness, or
varieties of hurtful as well as Impertinent Diversions, too
many of our <hi>Gentry</hi> have Resign'd and Abandoned them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
and notwithstanding that contempt and <hi>Burlesquing</hi>
of Reveal'd Religion, which some of them through a Depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedness
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:62502:6"/>
in their morals have ventered upon in hope thereby
to excuse and justify their Practical Conduct; yet there are
diverse both among the <hi>Grand</hi> and the <hi>Petite Nobles<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> who
with respect to their Natural Parts, their Instruction in
the <hi>Belles Lettres,</hi> acquaintance with all the kinds of good
Literature, and their penetration into the Controversies
of Religion, so far as the knowledge of them is Useful and
subservient to <hi>Faith,</hi> and <hi>Holiness,</hi> do equal and exceed very
many of our <hi>Theologues.</hi> Of which number, tho I Could
mention several, whose late writings against <hi>Atheism, Deism,
Popery, Socinianism,</hi> and all kinds of <hi>Irreligion,</hi> and <hi>Licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiousness,</hi>
have obtain'd them an Honourable and Just esteem
among such as are either good <hi>Scholars,</hi> or serious <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans;</hi>
yet I shall at this time put Mr. <hi>W.</hi> and Mr. <hi>A.</hi> only
in remembrance of one, namely of <hi>Edward Polhill,</hi> 
               <abbr>Esq</abbr> That
was a <hi>Lawyer</hi> and a <hi>Justice</hi> of the <hi>Peace,</hi> who in a Discourse
Published <hi>Anno</hi> 1673. concerning the Points now under
Debate (and which was then Recommended to the world
by the <hi>Prefatory Epistles</hi> of Dr. <hi>Owen,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Seaman,</hi> that
had the most uncontroverted Character of all those of their
respective Persuasions, for Literature and Piety) hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
his handling of the most Important Doctrines of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation,
with wonderful modesty and with Singular
strength of Argument from Scripture and Reason, given
us likewise, by the <hi>Terms,</hi> in which he Expressed his senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
about them, a President, that may Authorize and
Justify Mr. <hi>Lobb</hi> in the Use of that Phrase, for which
those two, whom you call your <hi>Brethren,</hi> have thought
fit to make it both the Design of their Books, and the
subject matter of their Conversation with Women, as
well as with Men, to <hi>Expose,</hi> and <hi>Lampoon</hi> him. The
Passage which I do Intend and Referr unto is in the

Christ (says he) in <hi>his first coming sustained two Distinct
Persons, his own, and ours:</hi> as <hi>he was in his own Person,</hi>
he was <hi>without Sin;</hi> but <hi>as he was our</hi> Surety, <hi>and</hi> sustained
our Persons, <hi>so our Sins were Imputed to him, and Imputed
to him according to Truth, because he was such,</hi> i. e. that upon
his being <hi>Sponsor</hi> for us, he became <hi>substitutively</hi> Guilty,
tho he continued always <hi>Personally</hi> Innocent.</p>
            <p>Nor could a <hi>Gentleman</hi>'s interposing in those <hi>Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies,</hi>
be construed for an Intended Reflection on Mr. <hi>Lobbs</hi>
Performances: seeing all who are not more the <hi>Partizans</hi>
of a Faction, than <hi>Advocates</hi> for Truth, will upon a peru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal
of what he hath written, find themselves obliged to
Confess, that he hath not only handled those matters which
have been under debate, with Laudable strength and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable
sincerity, in Opposition to the most shameful
<hi>Triflings,</hi> and the Grossest <hi>subterfuges,</hi> that ever men, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
to the Lowest measure of <hi>Intellectuals</hi> and <hi>Morals,</hi>
without Renouncing the Latter, and forfeiting the former,
could Prostitute themselves unto; but that he hath also
under the highest Provocations, which Insolent, Slanderous,
<hi>Smutty,</hi> and barbarous Treatment could excite and give
motives unto, behaved himself with that Temperance,
Candor and Brotherly Respect, that his Place and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter,
as a <hi>Minister</hi> of the Gospel, Required of him, and as
became the Degree of a <hi>Gentleman,</hi> and the Education of a
<hi>Scholar.</hi> So that for me, or for any other that is not
both better Adapted and more Invited unto it than I am,
to offer to come into his Assistance, with those poor <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruits</hi>
of <hi>Rational,</hi> or <hi>Theological</hi> Learning, which I have
been with some Industry Labouring to Attain, were both
to Rob him of the thanks that are due unto him for
having Vindicated and secured those Truths, which
his <hi>Antagonists</hi> have contriv'd to Undermine and supplant,
and to become Guilty of the Little and mean Vanity of
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:62502:7"/>
Attacking a yielding as well as a Routed Eenemy. For all
the victory he contended for, is no more, than that when
our open, and Avowed Adversaries the <hi>Socinians</hi> and <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minians,</hi>
cannot by force and dint of <hi>Arguments</hi> beat us off
the <hi>Doctrinals</hi> of our <hi>Faith;</hi> they may neither be <hi>Filched</hi>
and <hi>Trapan'd</hi> from us, by the Clandestine Arts, nor clan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
<hi>surrendred,</hi> if not shamefully <hi>Betrayed,</hi> thro either
the <hi>Ignorance</hi> or the <hi>Conspiracy</hi> of those, who <hi>Pitch</hi> their

<hi>Colours,</hi> and who by wearing the <hi>Livery</hi> of <hi>Orthodox Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines,</hi>
exact and Receive <hi>Sallaries,</hi> and <hi>Pay,</hi> as <hi>Guardians</hi>
of the <hi>Reformed</hi> Belief, against both the <hi>Remonstrants,</hi> and
those of the <hi>Cracovian</hi> Creed. And so if there be not an Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presidented
Measure of <hi>Dissimulation,</hi> and <hi>foolery</hi> in the last
<hi>Replies</hi> both of Mr. <hi>A.</hi> and Mr. <hi>W.</hi> he hath either gained,
and Proselyted them unto, or wrested; and Extorted from
them, all that is material in what he hath been Pleading
for; namely, that our Lord Jesus Christ upon his under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking
to be a Mediator between God and us, came under
the <hi>Sanction</hi> of the Law, which we had <hi>violated<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
had the <hi>Guilt</hi> of our <hi>Sins Legally</hi> transferred upon,
and <hi>Judicially</hi> Imputed to him, so as to be the <hi>meritorious
Cause</hi> of his sufferings, which <hi>he</hi> thro <hi>undergoing</hi> in our
room, and stead, did thereby <hi>Expiate</hi> them and make At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonement
for us.</p>
            <p>And as to those <hi>Terms</hi> and <hi>Phrases,</hi> about which they
Continue to squabble, with an Impertinence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Insincerity,
and <hi>chicane,</hi> that would be Reproachfull in the Mercenary
Scriblers of <hi>Baldwin's</hi> and <hi>Snowdens</hi> weekly <hi>Mercuries;</hi> they
have hitherto been able to Assign no Reason, why he should
be Ashamed of, and depart from them. Seeing that as with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

Ignorance of, or dare to Contradict the meaning, and sense
which hath been Affixed unto them, by those that best
understood those <hi>controversies,</hi> and have managed them
with the most success, against the Common Enemies of
the Principal <hi>Fundamentals</hi> of our Christian Faith, without
being in the Least suspected of verging to <hi>Antinemianism;</hi>
so they cannot without a measure of <hi>Assurance,</hi> whereof no
modest Person would be fond, and without the becoming
Lyable to the Charge of Apparent <hi>Defamation,</hi> pretend
that he hath otherwise Used and Applyed them, than in
and according to the stated and setled signification, and
Import that they were Designed unto, towards the secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
and being a Fence about, as well as for the Conveying
these <hi>Truths</hi> with the greater Perspicuity to the minds of
Believers, in which they have had their Place given and
Assigned them, in order to the application of them. And tho
I will neither Censure, nor Condemn any Persons as <hi>Hetro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox,</hi>
for Declining to express their Sentiments in the <hi>Forms,
Modes,</hi> and <hi>Schemes</hi> of Speech, that are most Legitimated,
and made Current by Vulgar Use, when I find them to be
at an Agreement with the rest of the Reformed Divines in
and about <hi>Doctrinal Articles;</hi> And will only blame them
for their Affected and Phantastick <hi>squeamishness,</hi> or Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
some weak place to be about them, and that their
uppermost Rooms are not over-well furnished; yet when
I find such a <hi>Byass</hi> and Turn given to the Principles of our
Belief, and such a Gloss, meaning and Paraphrase put upon
them, as will both Expose them to the Attacques, and sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render
them to be Triumph'd over by those that <hi>Ridicule</hi>
as well as Deny them; namely, That <hi>our Sins were only an
Occasion of the Sufferings of Christ,</hi> and <hi>not properly the meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:62502:8"/>
Cause of them;</hi> and <hi>that his sufferings were not truly, only,
but Analogically</hi> Penal. As that Great and Learned Man Mr.
<hi>Baxter,</hi> (whose Memory, notwithstanding his Mistakes in
diverse very substantiall Doctrines of Faith, will be always
Precious, and held in honourable Remembrance,) disavow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly,
and with an Openess natural to him, doth Express him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.
And as to those Notions as well as <hi>Phraseologies,</hi> and
Modes of Speech, Mr. <hi>Williams,</hi> for the Defence and Vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

it is so far from being a Practice Injurious unto, and a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligning
Jealousie of those, that do thus Express themselves,

whereby he seeks to Skreen himself, <hi>viz.</hi> That the <hi>Terms</hi>
Mr. <hi>Lobb</hi> hath been Contending for, are not hitherto al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
a Room in the <hi>Confessions</hi> of <hi>Faith</hi> of the Reformed
Churches. Whereunto I will here only add, that there
is the <hi>Equivalent</hi> and <hi>Equipollent</hi> of them in all those <hi>Confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,</hi>
and that as the having Recourse to some peculiar
Words and Phrases, may in <hi>Controversal</hi> Discourses, where
Doctrines are <hi>Scholastically</hi> managed, be necessary, as well
as usefull, towards the Explanation and Defence of <hi>Confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sional</hi>
Articles, which would not have been so well adap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to the Understanding of all Believers in the <hi>Compendious</hi>
Draught and <hi>Summary</hi> Declaration of them, which <hi>Confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions</hi>
are chiefly calculated for, and designed to give. So
I dare knowingly, and therefore with Confidence affirm,
that there is nothing which he hath said in this matter,
that Looks with that severity upon his <hi>Antagonists,</hi> and
against which their unmannerly, and rancorous, but weak
Reflections are so directly level'd, as what hath been written
by <hi>Grotius, Hoornbeck, Cloppenburg, Voetius, Rivet, Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senius,</hi>
and many others, to whom they are not to be
thought comparable either in Theologick Learning in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral;
or for particular Accomplishments and skill to conflict
with the <hi>Socinians</hi> and <hi>Arminians.</hi> And as it is both a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation,
and a Glory to have Learn'd of, and to follow
and Imitate those great, and Excellent men; so it can be
no Disgrace to bear a share in the Contumelies, Aspresions,
and Contempt, which are thrown upon them by these Pert,
and snarling Scriblers, rather than Accurate Disputants.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:62502:9"/>
But upon observing to whom Mr. <hi>Lobb</hi> hath Addressed
his former Book, in the Nature, and way of an <hi>Appeal,</hi> and
the choice he hath made of a Person, worthy of the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Veneration for Extensiveness of Literature, Solidity of
Judgment, Justness of Thought, Clearness and Purity
of Stile, and for an unbyss'd and sincere Regard to Truth,
as well as for an Exact Acquaintance with, and a thorough
Penetration into these Controversies; and that he hath
Referred unto him, all that is, and hath been under De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate
between him and his Adversaries, it would proclaim
a Haughtiness in me parallel to what anon I am to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse
others guilty of, should I offer farther to interpose
in any of the material Parts of these Controversies, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
the Determination seems to be undertaken by, as well
as it is expected from him. Nor can, or will Mr. <hi>L.</hi>
be blamed, for the having Elected him <hi>Arbiter</hi> between
them, in relation to their <hi>contested</hi> and disputed Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
by any, of what Persuasion soever, either here or
elsewhere, to whom his Character is known, as it is to
all the Learned and Ingenuous of the present Age, with,
and among whom the Dignity whereunto he is Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,
and which he bears in the Church, is accounted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
his Merit. And the Esteem they have for his En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowments,
as a Gentleman, a Scholar, and a Prelate,
makes them to judge and reckon, that no Station, or Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
is, or can be Proportionable to his worth, save the
Highest and most Elevated, that is communicable in these
Kingdoms to those of the Sacred Order. And the <hi>Speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi>
he hath already given of his great Judgment, wonderful
Moderation, and exact Impartiality, in a Letter to Mr. <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liams</hi>
(which he hath Published) about a <hi>Commutation of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons</hi>
between the Lord Jesus Christ, and those for whom
he Intentionally Dyed, to purchase both-Forgiveness
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:62502:10"/>
and Eternal Life; may at once both inlighten, and assure Mr.
<hi>Lobb,</hi> That the Cause for which he hath been contending,
will not suffer Prejudice in his hands; Seeing in the room of
Discharging and Disclaiming the Phrase, not to say,
of Lampooning, and Ridiculing it, which Mr<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>A.</hi> hath
Attempted and Endeavoured to do, with an Air of Pride and
Prophaness, which must necessarily flow from an Ignorant, if
not a Depraved Mind, the Bishop hath Judiciously Assigned,
and Established the Import of it, without verging in the
least to <hi>Antinomianism,</hi> on the one hand, or gratifying the <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinians</hi>
on the other. And though he both Renounceth, and
overthroweth the <hi>Sense,</hi> to which it hath been Ignorantly
and Corruptly Perverted by Dr. <hi>Crisp,</hi> and those who have
either <hi>unthinkingly,</hi> or <hi>Heterodoxly</hi> Imbibed his Notions, and
showeth with what Repugnancy to Common Sense, Inconsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stency
to Revelation, Prejudice to Practical Godliness, and
Danger to the Souls of Men, they have affixed that wild mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
unto it, yet it is with the Gravity, Modesty, and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency,
which becomes his own Character, and are by Sober
People expected in all Discourses upon Theological Subjects;
and not with that <hi>Raillery,</hi> and <hi>Buffounry,</hi> which Mr. <hi>Alsop</hi>
treats of it, even at the very time, and in the very Book,
when, and wherein he is forced to acknowledge, That it is
both capable of a very good Sense, and hath been frequently
used by such as are deservedly esteemed the most Learned,
and Orthodox Divines. For not being contented to have
represented it as a <hi>Phrase, that in all respects carries a mutual
and reciprocal Sence; and that if</hi> Grammar <hi>may have leave to
Judge, must sound so to</hi> English <hi>Ears, let them be of what Bore
they will;</hi> he endeavoureth to Burlesque, and render it Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous,
by Unseemly and Foolish Comparisons, <hi>of a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutation
of Prisoners between</hi> France <hi>and</hi> England, <hi>the exchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
of Black-acre by</hi> A, <hi>for White-acre from</hi> B; <hi>and of Malt

55, 56. which, to put the mildest Construction upon, that
the words, which I have cited, can possibly bear, is to be
<hi>Pedantick,</hi> and <hi>Drollish,</hi> on a Serious Subject, and to make
Sport and Mirth for the Profane, with what the Wisest, and
Best think is their Duty to believe. Nor is there any Truth
whatsoever, either in Natural, or Revealed Religion, so sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred,
which they, who will allow themselves the like Licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiousness
that Mr. <hi>Alsop</hi> assumeth, may not Prostitute and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
by Copying after this Original. For admitting, that
they against whom he writes, were not only Indiscreet and
Unwary in the expressing of their Sentiments, but even Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous,
in some of their Opinions; yet they ought to be
calmly argued with, and not huffingly <hi>Buffoon'd:</hi> and their
Understandings should be address'd, by strong Reasons cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed
in Temperance and Genteel Language, and not their
Resentments and Passions provok'd by unmannerly Allusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
and by nauseous offensive Jests. And certainly they are
less Criminal before God, who when they <hi>Err,</hi> do it with
Modesty, and Humility, and a Teachableness that will ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
their being rectify'd; than they, who when they plead
for Truth, do it with Haughtiness and Scurrility; seeing the
first is only a <hi>Mistake</hi> of the <hi>Vnderstanding,</hi> to which both
the Wisest, and Best, are incident; whereas the <hi>Latter</hi> is a
palpable <hi>Faeult</hi> of the Will, and has its Source in the Worst,
and most Immoral Qualities. Whereunto all that I will add
at present upon this Head, is, That they, who Regulate both
their <hi>Conceptions,</hi> and <hi>Expressions,</hi> about the Satisfaction of
Christ, with a Respect and Reverence to the Holiness and
Righteousness of God, and his <hi>Veracity</hi> in the <hi>Sanction,</hi> which
he annexed to the Law, will not be easily prevailed upon to
abandon the <hi>Terms,</hi> and <hi>Phrases,</hi> which they have found
useful towards the Declaring and Illustrating the Glory of
those Perfections, and the giving us the most Instructive
and Lively Impressions of our Obligation to the Love and
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:62502:11"/>
Compassion of our Redeemer, in what he became, did, and
underwent for us; by reason of their having had false <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrases,</hi>
and Expositions, put upon them, by a few, weak,
unthinking, and unstudied People. Seeing, should we upon
this single, and alone Motive, comply with the Importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of Mr. <hi>W.</hi> and Mr. <hi>A.</hi> in this matter, there is hardly
any <hi>Phrase</hi> invented by Men, for the better and clearer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veying
their minds to one another, in their speaking and
writing about the Truths of the Gospel, or Authorized by
God in those Revelations he hath vouchsafed us, for the
Commanding out Faith, and the Adjusting, and Governing
the measures of it, which we shall not upon the like Induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
be obliged to Forsake and Renounce. For, as in the
Vertue of that <hi>Topick,</hi> and according to that Rule of Procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure,
the <hi>Terms</hi> of <hi>Trinity, Hypostatical Vnion,</hi> yea, the
word <hi>Satisfaction</hi> it self, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> may be wrested from, and
ought to be resigned by us; so there are a vast number of
plain <hi>Scriptural Expressions,</hi> which must be relinquished and
forsook, as being Impeachable for having had very absurd sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
affixed unto them, and the having been applied to very
ill Purposes. As particularly, without mentioning any other,
that Expression, <hi>This is my Body;</hi> which Christ pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
of the <hi>Bread,</hi> upon the <hi>Consecration of it,</hi> in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
Supper. yea, the very Phrase of <hi>Christ's Dying in
our Room and Stead,</hi> from the owning whereof Mr. <hi>A.</hi> and
Mr. <hi>W.</hi> do so Justify and Vindicate their <hi>Orthodoxness</hi> in the
Article of Christ's Satisfaction, must by that reason be like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
parted with.</p>
            <p>So that upon a Contemplation of what hath been hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
and is now written by Mr. <hi>Lobb,</hi> and of what is both
Longed for, and expected from the Reverend <hi>Bishop,</hi> all that
falls within my Circle, and remains for me to do, is Civilly
to Reprimand, and Chastize Mr. <hi>Alsop,</hi> for his Pride and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mannerly
treating of Persons of Equal, yea, of Superiour
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:62502:11"/>
Vertue, Learning and Merit to himself, and for his wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of, and concerning such <hi>Theological Doctrines,</hi> as have
always been, and still are accounted important <hi>Articles</hi>
of the Christian Faith, with a Lightness and Ribaldry, not
to be parallel'd in any that value themselves for Religion,
or good manners, and whereof we have no President,
save from the Tongues and Pens of the Atheistical and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious.
For instead of Reasoning about matters, upon
which the Stamp of Divine Authority is said, and pleaded
to be Impressed, with the Gravity, Temperance, and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidity,
which would have been expected from a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
or a Scholar, and much more from one called a <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster</hi>
of the <hi>Gospel,</hi> he hath Discoursed of them in such a
Stile of wanton <hi>Drollery,</hi> Clownish <hi>Jesting,</hi> unmannerly
<hi>Banter,</hi> and Pedantick <hi>Repartees,</hi> as would be thought a
Disgrace unto and Infamous for the Stage, and Judged to
be Designed for no other End, but to give a Diversion un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
and make sport for a <hi>Mob,</hi> and <hi>Rabble.</hi> Now, for as
much as the calling him to an Account, and the Rebuking
him for this, is unsuitable to Mr. <hi>Lobbs Genius</hi> and Temper,
and below the Dignity of the Reverend and Learned Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop,
and yet necessary, as well as called for, by those who
do maintain a Zeal for supporting the Authority, Majesty
and Credit of Divine Revelation, preserve a Pity and
Compassion for Mr. <hi>Alsop,</hi> or who entertain a Tenderness
for the Souls of Men, whose Minds and Morals are in Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of being Infected, and Debauched by this Licentious
way of Writing about Divine things, I will attempt it,
tho it be with a doing Violence to my Inclination. And
when others are from a Zeal for the Glory of God, the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of our Religion, and the Reputation of the Kingdom,
Employing their Pens and Parts, to Correct and Reform the
<hi>Stage,</hi> and for bringing the <hi>Poets,</hi> whose Labours are
cheifly Designed for the <hi>Play-House,</hi> to write with Innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:62502:12"/>
and <hi>Decorum,</hi> it would be strangely surprizing and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruous,
should none be sound to give Check to such of the
<hi>Clergy,</hi> as do not only Imitate them in most of their vices,
but do fall infinitely short of them, in their Sermons as
well as their <hi>Polemicks</hi> in what is Comely, Pleasant and
Instructive in <hi>Comedies.</hi> And whosoever he was that writ
the <hi>Letter,</hi> prefixed to Mr. <hi>Lobbs Defence of the Report,</hi> he
appears to have been Mr. <hi>Alsops</hi> Particular Friend, and to
have Intended him a Service, in the supposing him to be
<hi>Delirous:</hi> Seeing the believing him <hi>Distracted,</hi> is the best,
if not the only Excuse, that can be made for his Wild and
Extravagant Deportments: <hi>Madmen</hi> being only liable to
<hi>Pity,</hi> but not to <hi>blame.</hi> Nor are the <hi>Freaks</hi> and <hi>Foppish
Gambols,</hi> or the <hi>Outragious Transports</hi> of those, who are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in <hi>Bedlam,</hi> or whose condition qualifies them to be
there, Judg'd Meritorious of other Punishment, than of a
dark Lodging and of Physical Diet. Neither will the <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor</hi>
bring them to that Sobriety in their <hi>Paroxisms,</hi> as a
sturdy and merciless <hi>Porter</hi> will. They are sooner aw'd
into a sullen Calmness, if not into a Conversible Temper,
by a <hi>Ropes</hi> End, or a <hi>Cudgell;</hi> than by <hi>Rhetorical Haerangues,</hi>
or <hi>Medicinal Recipts.</hi> But seeing Mr. <hi>Alsop</hi> (as is observ'd
of all Madmen) will be <hi>Sober</hi> in despite of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> as well
as of <hi>Galen,</hi> and doth not approve of the <hi>Apology,</hi> that was
made for him; he is to be applyed unto by means, that will
work upon his <hi>Mind,</hi> more than upon his Corporal <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours;</hi>
and which, instead of altering the <hi>Ferment</hi> of his
<hi>Blood,</hi> may open the Intellectual <hi>Tympany</hi> of his Pride and
Haughtiness. Yet, tho the <hi>Province</hi> I have undertaken,
and the Task which I am engaged in, will allow me much
greater <hi>Latitudes,</hi> than <hi>Disputations</hi> about <hi>Questions</hi> of <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity</hi>
will do; I will nevertheless so behave my self in the
Reflections I am to make, as not to depart from the Rules
of Good Breeding, nor to forfeit my Discretion in Imitat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:62502:12"/>
of him. For albeit, it may be very Agreeable to his
manners and Conversation, to <hi>Slander, Lampoon</hi> and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
an <hi>Adversary;</hi> when his Business should only be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destly
to <hi>Confute him;</hi> yet it is neither Consonant with, nor
Reconcileable to mine. And tho some things I may have
Occasion to say, may be a Little smart, and thought to
have too much <hi>Salt</hi> in them; yet there shall be nothing
Course and Unsavory, but all Pallatable, and well dress'd.</p>
            <p>And as I am not one of those weak Principles, or sneak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Temper, that will be menaced, or Discouraged, from
the Performance of a Duty, that I conceive to be Lawful,
and of Publick Advantage to mankind, and therefore neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary,
because of the malicious Insinuations, and the Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous
as well as the Rude, Ungenteel, and Unchristian
suggestions both of Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> and of Mr. <hi>Alsop;</hi> so
I do not believe, that any who with Justice Pretend to
sense, Breeding, manners, or Religion, will suffer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to be so Imposed upon, <hi>bubled</hi> and mislead, as to
think, that this undertaking, can have the least Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency
towards the Disturbing of the Government. For
tho they from a <hi>Feavorish</hi> Heat, and a Brutal Rage, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flaming
them against such as have Attackt them, and
from a <hi>Towring,</hi> but vain Opinion of themselves, would fain
have it believ'd, that the <hi>Peace</hi> of the <hi>Kingdom</hi> depends
upon their being counted <hi>Civil Gentlemen,</hi> and <hi>Orthodox
Divines;</hi> and that their Adversaries ought to be enrolled
among the <hi>Conspirators</hi> against his Majesties Person, Crown,
and Dignity; yet the generality of People, are not grow'n
so dis-ally'd to Reason and Humanity, as to admit the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
it obtruded upon their Understandings, that the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicting,
and modest Examination of some new Theolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical
Notions of Two <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Ministers, is, or can be
any Part of a <hi>Jacobite</hi> Plot. But that it doth rather bespeak,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:62502:13"/>
and confirm their being Guilty of the errours, whereof
they are accused; in that to cover themselves from <hi>Prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions,</hi>
and from having their Opinions Tryed at the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per</hi>
Barr, and in the way that is held <hi>Legal</hi> among Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars,
they repeate and take Sanctuary within the <hi>Verge</hi> of
the <hi>Court.</hi> And their dealing thus Wrathfully, and withall
Impertinently with those Persons, that have had the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity
and Fortitude to Attack them, being Lyable to many
Reflections, and not to be past by and over-look'd without
the bestowing a few upon it, I shall therefore here transcribe
their own Words, that the Reader may the better Judge,
with what Meekness and Decency, tho with some measure
of <hi>Picquancy,</hi> I treat them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>The Common Interest</hi> (saith
Mr. <hi>Williams,</hi> p 86. of his <hi>Answer</hi> to the <hi>Report) will not be
long sacrificed, even (some Imposed on) will find out the Iustru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and Designs of our Breaches, namely, that Vnless a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
be a Non-Juror, a Non-Associator, Plotter, and Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor
of other Ministers (in Imitation of himself) to Pray so
for the King, as if either of the Two Kings may be Intended;
if they must at all seem to Pray for King</hi> William, <hi>he must be
held a Hypocrite, for a Rhetorical Expression,</hi> in <hi>an Address to
the Late King</hi> James, <hi>and because of no other thing, than
swearing Allegiance to King</hi> William, <hi>signing the Association,
and carrying it becoming a Loyal Subject, in his Prayers, Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
peaceable Behaviour, and Advices, be accounted to act
contradictiously to what he said and did under the late Reign.</hi>
And in the same Strain of <hi>Accusation,</hi> and <hi>Calumny</hi> doth
Mr. <hi>Alsop,</hi> p. 34. of his <hi>Vindication</hi> of the <hi>Faithful Rebuke,</hi>
Insinuate that Mr. <hi>Lobb</hi> had been Criminally acquainted
with <hi>Friend, Fenwick,</hi> and <hi>Charnock,</hi> there being no other
reason Assignable besides the Endeavouring to get that Mark
and Character of Guilt and Infamy fastned upon him, why
he should say <hi>that he himself had no Correspondence with them.</hi>
Now I suppose, none will deny, but that the Assaulting
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:62502:13"/>
and falling upon their Adversaries with these Weapons,
and this sort of <hi>Artillery,</hi> is both more malicious, and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated
to do much more hurt, <hi>than if they had only sliced
upon them from their Posteriors,</hi> or <hi>fired against them with
Guns Loaded with Dung instead of Iron and Lead,</hi> that I may
use some of the <hi>Elegancies</hi> of Mr. <hi>Alsop</hi>'s <hi>Pastoral,</hi> as well
as <hi>Rhetorical</hi> Eloquence, pag. 49. <hi>ubi Supra.</hi> Seeing all
the Danger and Damage from the one would be only to
be a little <hi>Smutted</hi> and defiled, which may be Rubb'd or
washen off without great Labour, or Expence; whereas
the t'other is the shooting <hi>Bombs</hi> and <hi>Granadoes,</hi> against
which it is but a weak and feeble <hi>Shelter</hi> to be entrench'd
without the <hi>Walls</hi> of <hi>Innocency, Loyalty,</hi> and Peaceable Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour:
Especially when that Terrible and Destructive
<hi>Artillery</hi> is managed by such skilful <hi>Engineers,</hi> as those two
<hi>Preachers</hi> appear to be in the Arts of Murthering, had they
the Application, and Exertion of the Laws against Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
in their Power, and should they be trusted with the
executing of them upon such whom they out of <hi>Pique</hi> and
Spleen should think fit to Impeach, and Pronounce Crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal.
Nor was there any need for Mr. <hi>Alsop</hi>'s asking Mr. <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sop,</hi>
what <hi>Post he would allow him under Mr.</hi> Williams, <hi>that
he might Legally demand a Living, and Sallary for it?</hi> p. 21.
<hi>ibid.</hi> Seeing without waiting untill he should Testify his
Friendship, and employ all his Skill and Interest in assigning
him a <hi>Post</hi> that would Deserve a <hi>Living,</hi> tho it might not
bring him any Considerable <hi>Wages,</hi> both he and Mr. <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liams</hi>
have advanced themselves unto, and taken Possession
of an <hi>Office,</hi> that may prove very Beneficial unto them, if it
were but honourable. For as if neither the <hi>Work</hi> of the
<hi>pulpit,</hi> whereunto they Pretend to be called, and for the
Discharge whereof they have Liberal Allowances Assigned
them, nor the having Assumed to themselves the <hi>Chair</hi> for
Reading <hi>Scholastical Divinity,</hi> were Proportionable to their
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:62502:14"/>
many and Extraordinary Qualifications, nor come up to the
Dimensions of their Universal <hi>Talents,</hi> they have emitted an
<hi>Advertisement</hi> from <hi>Westminister</hi> and <hi>Moorfields,</hi> to save
the Charges they must have been at in getting it Published
from the <hi>Savoy,</hi> declaring where two <hi>Informers</hi> may be
found, for those that have occasion for such; and, having
a Mind to Use them, will come up to the <hi>Price,</hi> which
<hi>persons</hi> of their Character and Reputation have a Right
to Insist upon and demand. And by the <hi>Essay</hi> they have
given of their Adaptedness for their <hi>Employ,</hi> they will ease
the Government the Expense that it is at, in Maintaining
and Recompencing those, who will only <hi>swear</hi> to what
they <hi>Perfectly know,</hi> the Fertility of their <hi>Fancy</hi> Qualifying
them to <hi>Forge</hi> and Invent <hi>Crimes,</hi> and the Complexion of
their <hi>Consciences</hi> giving them a Dispensation to <hi>Depose</hi> them.
For upon no other <hi>Topicks</hi> can either Mr <hi>Alsop</hi> Arraign
Mr. <hi>Lobb</hi> for having been Acquainted with <hi>Charnock,</hi> or
Mr. <hi>Williams Impeach the Author of the Letter, Prefix'd to
the Defence of the Report, as alike obnoxious to him;</hi> after he
had accused him of a great many things that were Disloyal,
and of some that were directly Treasonable; while in the
mean time he neither then did, or hitherto can know, whom
the <hi>Writer</hi> of that <hi>Letter</hi> was, upon any grounds that will
support a <hi>Legal Evidence,</hi> or so much as give a Foundation
for <hi>Moral Certainty.</hi> And to accuse a Person upon a wicked
<hi>Suspicion,</hi> which is the whole upon which he Superstructs
what he so boldly alledgeth, is to Represent himself in
worse <hi>Features</hi> and in <hi>Blacker Colours,</hi> than I have taken the
Liberty to <hi>Limn,</hi> and Draw him. And it ought to <hi>allarm</hi>
all <hi>Mankind,</hi> whose misfortune hath brought them within
the Circle of his Acquaintance and Conversation, to find
how precariously they hold their Lives, if he through <hi>ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>price</hi>
and humour should be Displeased, or but grow Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous,
that they pay him not that Profound Devotion, which
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:62502:14"/>
he expects should be rendred to his Person and Opinions
And as for the <hi>Complement,</hi> which he bestows upon that
<hi>Gentleman</hi> whom he knoweth not, if <hi>his stretching forth his
Claws, and being Rowsed to execute fiery Threats,</hi> ibid. <hi>ubi
Supra;</hi> it doth only show his <hi>Conscience, Judgment,</hi> and
<hi>Breeding</hi> to be of a piece, and that his <hi>Language</hi> is of an
<hi>alliance</hi> with his <hi>Birth</hi> and <hi>Manners.</hi> However, were that
Person either the <hi>Beast,</hi> or the <hi>Bird</hi> of <hi>Prey,</hi> which
Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> in his <hi>Boarish</hi> and <hi>Clownish</hi> Rhetorick has
Represented him, I do think it would have been discreetly
done to have omitted the Rude and Brutish <hi>Allusion,</hi>
and not to have thereby exposed himself to fall under
his <hi>Fangs</hi> and <hi>Talons.</hi> And, if I did not Judge it a Part
both of <hi>Civility</hi> and Religion, to write with more Reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedness
of Persons, than Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> by Education, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse,
or good <hi>Morals,</hi> hath arrived unto, it would be no
Difficult <hi>Province,</hi> to give an amazing Abatement, to some
peoples great Pretensions to Loyalty. Nor do I understand
how <hi>Republican</hi> Principles, wherewith I know many <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians</hi>
that <hi>vouch</hi> themselves <hi>Partizans</hi> for the Present
<hi>Government,</hi> to be deeply <hi>Tinctur'd,</hi> are reconcileable to that
<hi>zeal</hi> for <hi>Monarchy</hi> and <hi>Fidelity</hi> to his <hi>Majesty,</hi> which they
would fain be Distinguished from others by. Yea I have
more Reason to believe, and better <hi>Memoirs</hi> upon which to
Justify it, than Generosity and Good nature will allow me
to Discover, that their <hi>Loyalty</hi> doth not so much respect
the <hi>Kings Title,</hi> as the <hi>Advantages</hi> they have made, and
do further hope to make, by <hi>serving</hi> themselves upon Him.
But neither my Temper, my Breeding, or my <hi>Morals</hi> will
suffer me to <hi>Retaliate</hi> towards them, as they do Deserve, or
to make those <hi>Reprizals</hi> upon them, that I easily might,
and which their Provocations would be accounted by most
<hi>Casuists,</hi> to have rendred not only Lawful, but Necessary.
And Mr. <hi>Williams</hi>'s advancing these Defamatory Accusations
against one <hi>Brother,</hi> and another <hi>Stranger,</hi> which he hath
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:62502:15"/>
done, will appear to have been as Foolish, and Impudent,
as it was Unjust and Cruel: because of his having been Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious
himself to Suspicions and Charges of the same
kind, not only among those of other <hi>Churches,</hi> but the
Members of his own <hi>Congregation;</hi> for the Removing of
whose <hi>Jealousies,</hi> and the <hi>silencing</hi> their <hi>Clamours,</hi> he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted
and <hi>debauched</hi> the <hi>Pulpit,</hi> by <hi>Haranguing</hi> his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors
from it with an Invective against King <hi>James,</hi> and
the <hi>Jacobites,</hi> when his whole <hi>Work</hi> in that <hi>place</hi> should
have been to <hi>Preach</hi> the <hi>Gospel,</hi> and not to have vented a
<hi>Satyr,</hi> or Read a Lecture of <hi>Politicks.</hi> Nor could any Man
whose Understanding were not both darkned and perverted
by Passions, and Revenge, that had passed through divers
<hi>Ordeals</hi> himself upon Suspicions much better grounded, than
those upon which he hath Traduced and Slandered others,
write with that Licentious and Bloody Rage that he has
done, concerning a Brother and a Fellow Subject, in Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaching
him of Disloyalty and Treason. But I will keep
my self within the Limits of moderate <hi>Resentment,</hi> and do
heartily wish, that the <hi>Biographers,</hi> for whose Pens he seems
ambitious to create Imployment, may treat him with that
Gentleness and Decency which I have done; yea, his whole
Foregoing Accusation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> were it <hi>time,</hi> is yet altogether Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent.
Seeing the being either Imaginarily, or Really a
<hi>Jacobite,</hi> a <hi>Non-Juror</hi> and a <hi>Non-Associator,</hi> which are the
Titles he bestowes where, and upon whom he pleaseth,
do not in the least degrade a <hi>Person</hi> from being a <hi>Christian,</hi>
or a <hi>Scholar;</hi> or <hi>Vnqualify</hi> and <hi>Incapacitate him</hi> to Assert
the Commonly Received <hi>Protestant Doctrine,</hi> nor subject
him to Legal <hi>Penalties,</hi> because of his Detecting or Refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the <hi>Hetrodoxes</hi> of two <hi>Dissenting Presbyterian Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters.</hi>
And how happy would it be for Mr. <hi>Dryden, Dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fey,</hi>
&amp;c. if their calling Mr. <hi>Collier Jacobite,</hi> and <hi>Non Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror,</hi>
would pass with the thinking and Judicious Part of
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:62502:15"/>
               <hi>Mankind,</hi> as either a Reasonable, or Wise Answer to the
Admirable <hi>Discourse,</hi> which he hath Published of the <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morality
and Profaneness</hi> of the <hi>English</hi> Stage: But as few,
or none, even of those that frequent the <hi>Theatre,</hi> will be <hi>car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried</hi>
into so Foppish a Belief; so neither will the very <hi>Poets,</hi>
whom he hath Reprimanded, tho Persons of a great Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of assurance, and who do often take unjustifiable Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
in Exposing and Ridiculing such as offend them, so far
betray a want of Wit and Sense, as to offer that for any
part of a Reply. To reflect upon an Author in that Stile,
and Manner, may bear Proportion to the Intellectuals, and
become the Politicks of some <hi>Preachers,</hi> whose Ends both
over rule their Understandings and Influence their Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and may be admitted and applauded by little People,
who have nothing to commend them but their Ignorance
and Bigottry; but it will be Accounted by all others to be
Gross and Prodigious Impudence. And while they hope by this
Maliciousness towards <hi>others,</hi> to testify their <hi>own</hi> Loyalty for
the King; they even <hi>Lampoon</hi> him, and make the Government
Ludicrous, seeing the Fealty of His Majesties <hi>Leige</hi> People,
Is at this Rate of Arguing, no more to be measured by their
obedience unto, or Passiveness under the known Laws; but
by their humouring of Mr. <hi>Alsop,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Williams,</hi> and
their Implicitely believing whatever they Preach and
Write. Nor is the Kin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>s Person, or Crown to be esteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
safe, unless these two Gentlemen be carried towards it
with Extraordinary Admiration and Respect. And to
Controul their <hi>Dictator-ship,</hi> or to question their <hi>Orthodoxy,</hi>
is to be in a Conspiracy to Dethrone, if not to Assassinate
His Majesty<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> However, the Reverend Bishop of <hi>Worcester</hi>
is hereby Forewarn'd, to what Accusations he is to become
Obnoxious, in case he depart from supporting Mr. <hi>Williams</hi>'s
Notions, in the Discourse he hath undertaken to write con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
this Controversie. For he is no less than bound
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:62502:16"/>
unto, and put upon his good Behaviour, and to be pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
a <hi>Jacobite,</hi> and held for Disloyal, unless Mr. <hi>Williams</hi>'s
Judgment in Divinity, be Revived, and Acquiesced in as the
great and Universal <hi>Standard</hi> of <hi>Truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The next thing that deserves to be Animadverted upon,
and <hi>Reprimanded</hi> in Mr. <hi>Alsop,</hi> is his <hi>Phantastick</hi> Affectation of
being thought <hi>Witty,</hi> and the laying claim to a <hi>Talent,</hi> which
<hi>Nature</hi> hath <hi>Indisposed</hi> him for; and which nothing but Pride,
Frothiness and Vanity, together with an Ignorance of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
and of what his <hi>Faculty</hi> is adapted for, would have ever
made him pretend unto. For the most, that can be justly
allowed him, is, that he is fit to be a <hi>Droll,</hi> or a <hi>Buffoon;</hi> but
that he is otherwise a Person of <hi>Wit,</hi> none that understand
the <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Measures</hi> of it will upon any Terms grant him.
And if he any where obtain the Character of a <hi>Witty</hi> man,
it is only among little People, that have neither <hi>Genius,</hi> nor
good <hi>Relish:</hi> With whom it is an Ingenious and Genteel
qualification, to be able to Act the Part of a <hi>Jack-pudding.</hi>
But among those whom Excellency of Sense, and Accuracy
of gust distinguish from the Insipid and dull Rabble; all that
will be allowed him, is that he may set up for a <hi>Merry Andrew,</hi>
or hire himself out to be a <hi>Droll</hi> at <hi>Bartholomew-Fair.</hi> Now that
the <hi>Rebukes,</hi> which he deserveth, and which I am to give
him upon this account, may be the more <hi>Pungent,</hi> tho ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing
founded upon, and Warranted by all those <hi>Maxims</hi>
of Reason, from which <hi>wit</hi> is Denominated, and by which
it is Governed: I shall e're I proceed further on this <hi>Head,</hi>
briefly Intimate both what True <hi>wit</hi> is, and under what <hi>Rules,</hi>
and within what <hi>Limits</hi> it hath its esteem; and how Different it
is from foolish Drollery, mean Pedantry, and vain Jesting which
while they Excite Laughter in the <hi>Mob,</hi> beget a Contempt &amp;
Disgust in the <hi>Ingenious.</hi> True wit then Consists in Justness
of Thought, &amp; in Perspicuity and Neatness of Expression. In
taking Every <hi>Matter,</hi> whereof we speak or write, by its Right
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:62502:16"/>
and Proper <hi>Handle,</hi> and the having an Idea of it, compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensive
of all that it imports, and which reacheth both to
the utmost <hi>Dimensions</hi> of it, and the <hi>Harmony</hi> that is among
them, and then in the <hi>Cloathing</hi> our <hi>Conceptions</hi> concerning
it, with that <hi>Propriety</hi> and <hi>Neatness</hi> of <hi>Language,</hi> that may
sit <hi>decently</hi> and <hi>adroitly</hi> upon them, and give them their due,
and agreeable <hi>Air.</hi> In a word, it is to think <hi>Regularly,</hi> and
to speak <hi>Decently;</hi> to have our Notions Harmonious to the
Subject, and our Speech proportionate them. To say no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
unworthy of, and detractive from the <hi>Matters</hi> of
which we Treat, or unsuitable unto, or beneath the Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter
of <hi>Him</hi> that speaks; or that may Displease and Offend
the most Sensible and Vertuous part of those that hear.
And therefore it is, that to give Check to the Extravagancies
of a Wild Fancy, and to prevent the Rudeness of Language,
which through a Defectiveness of Breeding, or Morals, some
Persons may Licentiously Indulge themselves in, the greatest
<hi>Proprietors,</hi> as well as <hi>Masters</hi> of <hi>Wit,</hi> have mark'd out, and
given us the <hi>Boundaries</hi> of it. So that according to the <hi>Rules</hi>
they have assigned, and the Regulations which they have E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablished
for its <hi>Menage;</hi> It is always to be <hi>Manly,</hi> and not
<hi>Pedantick; Clean,</hi> and not <hi>Smutty; Fashionable,</hi> and not <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solete;
Civil,</hi> and not <hi>Detractive; Innocent,</hi> and not <hi>Profane;
Modest,</hi> and not <hi>Rude; Grave</hi> and <hi>Solid,</hi> and not <hi>Light</hi>
and <hi>Vain; Grateful</hi> to all, and Justly <hi>Displeasing</hi> to none;
'Tis not only to <hi>Humour</hi> an Auditory, but to Teach and
Instruct them; and adjusted to make others <hi>Wiser</hi> and <hi>Bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi>
as well as to <hi>entertain</hi> and divert them.</p>
            <p>Now how well Mr. <hi>Alsop</hi> hath attended to any one of
those <hi>Characters</hi> and <hi>Measures</hi> of <hi>Wit,</hi> is what I am to
proceed to enquire into, and whereof the Disquisition will
be the more Easy, in that his Departure from all of them,
is so visible, Gross and Frequent. For from the beginning
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:62502:17"/>
of the <hi>Book</hi> to the End of it, his <hi>Fancy, Judgment</hi> and <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage</hi>
are of an <hi>Alliance,</hi> and in every one of them he is
perfectly <hi>ridiculous.</hi> And if <hi>He</hi> ever heretofore had either
<hi>Vnderstanding,</hi> or <hi>Wit, Age</hi> hath Extinguished, or <hi>Pride</hi> and
<hi>Malice</hi> perverted them. Nor do I know any <hi>Apology</hi> can be
made for his manner of <hi>writing</hi> (seeing he will not allow
himself to be <hi>Lunatick</hi> and <hi>Delirous)</hi> but that God having
Created Men <hi>Risible,</hi> as well as <hi>Rational,</hi> and having gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
them no <hi>Faculties</hi> but what he hath provided <hi>Objects</hi> to
sute and Gratify, he takes himself to have been Formed to
find Exercise for our <hi>Risibility,</hi> instead of serving the End
of our <hi>Intellectual</hi> Powers. And it being with great a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version
that I expose any person to <hi>Laughter</hi> and <hi>Ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cule,</hi>
I shall therefore, to render him <hi>ridiculous,</hi> only show
him in the <hi>Picture</hi> drawn by himself, and which he hath
<hi>hung</hi> forth upon his own <hi>Sign-Post.</hi> Nor will I insist upon
his <hi>Puns</hi> and <hi>Quibbles,</hi> with which almost every Page of
his <hi>Pamphlet</hi> is <hi>flourish'd</hi> and <hi>adorn'd:</hi> save only transcribe
his <hi>Introduction</hi> to his <hi>Book,</hi> where, according to all the
<hi>Rules</hi> of <hi>Decorum,</hi> there should nothing appear but what is
<hi>Grave,</hi> Comely and Inviting. Whereas, instead of this, he
courts his Readers to an attendance upon the Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
he is to give them, in a Stile of Language, and with
a Turn of Thought, that are suited unto Guests at a <hi>Wake,</hi>
or to a <hi>Rural</hi> Crew met together in order to Dance a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
a <hi>May-pole. 'Tis somewhat a hard Case,</hi> saith he, <hi>that
having Just Cause to complain, I must complain to your self
of your self, and make your own Conscience Chancellor in
your Cause, placing you upon the Bench, who in Justice ought
to stand and Plead at the Bar.</hi> P. 3. Which is the addres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
his Readers in such a <hi>Scheme</hi> of Rhetorical Eloquence,
as his Cousin <hi>Sancho Pancho</hi> for they are nearly allyed in
their Intellectual Talents and Moral Perfectious, as well
as in their Gentlemanly Breeding) would have complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:62502:17"/>
of those that had <hi>Bastinado'd</hi> Master <hi>Don Quixot,</hi> ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in <hi>kindness</hi> to Cure his <hi>Phrenzy,</hi> and Discipline him
into Sobriety, or in <hi>Justice</hi> to <hi>Chastize</hi> him for the wild
<hi>Extravagancies,</hi> he had committed in his <hi>Knight Errantry.</hi>
But omitting his mean and silly <hi>Paedantries,</hi> to expose the
Vanity that he is guilty of in pretending to <hi>Wit,</hi> and the
Disgrace he hath done it through the Impropriety, and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purity
of Thought and Language, wherein he Affects to be
accounted an Eloquent and a <hi>Witty Man.</hi> And seeing
the <hi>Specimen</hi> I am to give of his shameful mis-carriages as
well as woful Defects in both these Particulars, will be
somewhat long, I shall therefore Interweave nothing of my
own, unless now and then by way of <hi>Parenthesis,</hi> but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
till afterwards the Reflections, which I design to make.
And for a beginning I refer you to Page 21. of his <hi>Vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,</hi>
where, upon the mighty Provocation of your hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Prefix'd to your <hi>Defence</hi> of the <hi>Report,</hi> the two Initi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
<hi>Letters</hi> of your Name (while himself in the mean time
appears without that <hi>Fiacho),</hi> he Accosts you with the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suing
Testimony of his <hi>Wit,</hi> and <hi>Civility. Could not</hi> (says
he) <hi>some friend of yours have adorn'd your Chariot, when
you are to Ride in Triumph over the Conquer'd Presbyterians?
such a Cypher would have given you a great Figure.</hi> For he
had Read, that these two <hi>Letters S. L.</hi> which you had
<hi>Stampt upon your Book, were once Printed with a Red hot Iron
upon the Cheeks</hi> of <hi>a Famous Patriot, who was a Confessor,
and hugely Ambitious to be a Martyr for his Countrey, and that
His Enemies did Interpret</hi> S. L. to <hi>stand for Slanderous Libel,
and one of the Wits of that time would needs</hi> give the <hi>Ety<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mology
of the word Libel, that is a Lie with a Bell hung about
the neck to Ring the Scandalous story up and down to his
Friends in the Countrey, and that it would have been as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently
set upon your Front</hi> as <hi>his Cheekes.</hi> To which I will
next subjoin what occurreth, <hi>p.</hi> 23. where with those mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:62502:18"/>
of Truth, and Cleanlyness that are Peculiar to him,
he stiles Mr. <hi>Lobbs</hi> Respectful, and modest Vindication of
what he Believes an Important Truth, an <hi>Intrenching your
cause in Dung, which gives more occasion for the Scavenger</hi>
than the <hi>Scholar; for the Shovel than the Pen to Remove it.</hi>
Whereunto may be added what he says p. 28. where De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signing
to Charge Mr. <hi>Lobb</hi> for having calumniated him,
in Imputing Opinions unto him which he no ways holds,
he Expresseth it as he thinks modestly, and with the height
of Genteelness, whereas the <hi>Phrase</hi> which he there useth
doth in the Judgment of all that are Persons of a true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
and of Good sense, Proclaim him an <hi>Ignoramus</hi> and a
<hi>Fop.</hi> The words I referr to are, <hi>that the Defence hath
prov'd himself hugely versed in the Oriental Tongues,</hi> in <hi>that
the second Language spoken in Paradise by the Grand Enemy
of Mankind,</hi> was <hi>the Lying, and Slandering Tongue.</hi> Nowtho
the Animadverting upon the <hi>Wit</hi> of this stands Adjourned
till anon, yet I would ask <hi>en passant</hi> by what Rules of <hi>Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar,</hi>
or <hi>Syntax,</hi> or by what <hi>Figure,</hi> or <hi>Trope</hi> in <hi>Rhetorick,
Defence</hi> hath got the Faculty of <hi>Proving himself,</hi> or comes
to be <hi>Conversant</hi> in <hi>Languages</hi> either <hi>Oriental,</hi> or other.
Surely he who Criticiz'd with so much rigor and severity
upon the word <hi>Observance</hi> instead of <hi>Observation,</hi> and upon
the Term <hi>Populacy</hi> in the room of <hi>Popularity,</hi> as he did with
an erected <hi>Crest</hi> and a <hi>Spread Train,</hi> p. 20. which a little
good nature might have inclin'd him to have taken for
errours of the Press; should have been careful not to have
betray'd so much either Ignorance or neglect, as are Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
in the Expressions newly mention'd.</p>
            <p>But I will proceed in calling over some more Examples,
and Consequently proofs of the Elevation of his <hi>Wit,</hi> and
of the purity of his <hi>Stile,</hi> whereof that which he hath affor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
us, <hi>pag.</hi> 29. shall be the next. <hi>All hands aloft! Mr.</hi> Lobb
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:62502:18"/>
hath brought from the Neighbour-hood of the Lay-st all at Pud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
Dock to the Printers all those Ordures, which will Imploy
all the City-Scavengers, and <hi>that he hopes the Reader has</hi>
therefore <hi>his Florentine Balsom, or whatsoever may be more
potent, ready to secure him against the Stench.</hi> And tho the
Passage, which I am to mention next be not altogether
so <hi>Smutty</hi> as the foregoing, yet it is vain, frothy, and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantick
in the highest Degree; you will find it in <hi>pag.</hi> 32.
Where upon Mr. <hi>Lobb</hi>'s having alledged, that he had once
promised to <hi>midwife</hi> a certain <hi>Book</hi> of his into the <hi>World,</hi>
He Replyes, that he <hi>never knew that Mr.</hi> Lobb <hi>had such hard
Labour in Teeming of Books into the World, that he should
need a Man-Midwife,</hi> and <hi>that it is certain he was always Big-belly'd,</hi>
and <hi>more fear he should be Delivered in the open streets,
like Pope</hi> Joan, <hi>than to need his manual operation, which his
Printer can do without his help, who never Professed, or was
Guilty of the Obstetrical Talent. The Countess of</hi> Holland
was <hi>brought to Bed of an Almanack, as many Children as
there are days of the year, and that he doubts not, but that
he a being Parturient Author can exclude as many without his
holding Mr.</hi> Lobbs <hi>back, tho perhaps he will need to hold his own
sides, that he split not with Laughter.</hi> Whereunto that
which he says <hi>p.</hi> 85. is of a piece and an Allyance, where
comparing Mr. <hi>Lobb,</hi> and himself together, he Challenges
the Preference in these Terms, <hi>that there is the same Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
between a preaching Sophister, and a well studied Divine,
that there is between a Petty Fogger with all his Chicanery,
and a profound Lawyer.</hi> Nor doth he give better proof either
of his <hi>Wit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> or of his <hi>Breeding,</hi> p. 86. where thinking to <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose</hi>
Mr. <hi>Lobb</hi> he makes himself <hi>Ridiculous</hi> by the <hi>Foppishness</hi>
of his <hi>thoughts,</hi> and <hi>coarsness</hi> of his <hi>Language. As a wisp</hi>
(saith he) <hi>is a Theame copious enough to engage an Harangue
for an hour Long to a well studied Scold;</hi> so <hi>these two Letters
D. W.</hi> (i. e. Daniel Williams) <hi>shall serve to Equip a Fleet
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:62502:19"/>
of Pamphlets. And that had it not been for him hitherto, and
now for himself, he knows not what the Club of Retailers would
have done for a little scribling Practice,</hi> or <hi>where they would
have had bread.</hi> Surely of all men, Mr. <hi>Alsop</hi> should least
pretend to <hi>Wit,</hi> seeing he never endeavours to show it
but it is thro being and acting the <hi>Buffoon.</hi> For whether
he write <hi>metaphorically,</hi> and by way of <hi>Allusion,</hi> or after
the natural plain manner, without <hi>Tropes,</hi> and <hi>Figures,</hi> he
is equally Boorish, and Impure, and all he says is either
wholly Impertinent, or else Clownish, or downright Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baldry,
of which it were easy to give many more Instances,
were it not that I blush to go on in Repeating, what thro
partly the childishness, and partly the Impurity of the
Thought, and thro the coarsness and Indecency of the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,
must not only offend the consciences of those that
are vertuous, but be Counted an Affront to the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standings
of such as are Ingenious. And of such a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion
do I take the following Passages to be, namely that
<hi>p.</hi> 131, 132. where he says, <hi>that Mr.</hi> Lobb <hi>was never co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stive
in his scribling humours, but that of late he is grown so
Laxative, that all the Astringents in the Shops will not
Check his scripturiency, but out it flies, without the Preface
of saving your Presence.</hi> And that other, <hi>p.</hi> 140. where the
most respectful <hi>Epithets</hi> and <hi>Titles,</hi> that he is pleased to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe
some of the Presbyterian Ministers by, to dignify
them with, is the calling them <hi>Reverend Nine Pins.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As if all that they were either fit for, or worthy of, were
to be kept in the <hi>Little,</hi> and for the most part <hi>Scandalous
Houses</hi> of Entertainment, to be subservient to the sport,
and diversion of <hi>Tipling</hi> Guests. Nor is that passage, which
we have p. 137. any signal Demonstration of true <hi>Wit,</hi>
good Manners, or Genteel Language; where intimating
the opposition that hath been given, and always will to
some of Mr. <hi>Williams</hi>'s Theological Notions, he thus Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presseth

it, <hi>viz. That he must be placed as a Shrove-Tuesday
Bird, five Throws two pence, so long as any man can find a
Cudgel to bestow upon him.</hi> And such is my dulness of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding,
and my unacquaintedness with propriety and
neatness of Speech, that I can neither discern the <hi>Wit,</hi> nor
admire the Eloquence of that <hi>Paragraph,</hi> p. 104. where
Mr. <hi>Alsop,</hi> being to Instruct Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> how to avoid
the envy of his Neighbours (for writing upon that
Motive himself, rather than out of any regard he has to
Truth, he fancieth that others must also do it under the like
Influence) <hi>he advised him to be content to draw in the Thillar's
place in the Team, and let another walk gravely before him,
with the high Foretop, and the melodious Collar of Bells, and
all the gaudy Trappings.</hi> To which all that I will subjoin,
shall be a passage in <hi>pag.</hi> 70. wherein although there be as
little of bright and <hi>Shining Wit</hi> as in the former, yet there is
a great deal nauseous and <hi>glaring Profaneness.</hi> For, having
taken notice, that <hi>there are some Learned and Godly Divines</hi>
(whom nevertheless he doth not name, that the suspicion of
being one of the number, may fall upon Mr. <hi>Lobb) who have
mentioned a Certain Bond, wherein Christ,</hi> and <hi>the Elect are said
to be jointly Bound to God,</hi> he thereupon adds in an <hi>Impure,</hi> as
well as a <hi>Jocular</hi> way, <hi>That he could never get sight of that
Bond, no more than of our own Original Contract, or the</hi> pacta
Conventa <hi>in a Remoter Kingdom, where Mr.</hi> Lobb <hi>having grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Acquaintance, may possibly have better Intelligence.</hi> Now to
Omit the Rude and unmannerly <hi>Jest</hi> and <hi>Buffoonry</hi> in the
last Words, and how that it was to do Violence to his own
Conscience, as it is to his Pride, to believe Mr. <hi>Lobb</hi> to have
a greater <hi>Acquaintance</hi> in <hi>Poland,</hi> or any where else, than
he thinks his Merit hath obtain'd for him, or that Mr. <hi>Lobb</hi>
can receive better <hi>Intelligence</hi> from thence, or from any
other Place, than is out of admiration of his Worth trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
and conveyed unto him; all that I will observe
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:62502:20"/>
is, that it is a <hi>Burlesquing</hi> things that are held <hi>sacred.</hi> And
were these Divines mistaken, yet they ought to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed
with respect and modesty, and not exposed and <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

and the matter, wherein they and others differ,
should be Discours'd with Reverence, and not by way of

               </gap>ict <hi>Justice;</hi> so, tho
it may not exactly be a Law of <hi>Revelation,</hi> yet it is one of
<hi>Genteel Manners,</hi> not to <hi>Lampoon</hi> what another doth <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giously</hi>
believe. And were he Guilty of holding what Mr.
<hi>Alsop</hi> by his <hi>Innuendo's</hi> and tacit Insinuations imputes to
him; yet I see no cause why he should be ashamed either
of the Doctrine it self, or of being <hi>Listed</hi> among those
Divines who have Believ'd and Taught it; Seeing no less
a Man, than the Learned, Pious, and truly Venerable
Dr. <hi>Bates</hi> has affirm'd, that <hi>Christ entered into the same
Bond that we had forfeited,</hi> cap. 13. p. 240. of his Excellent
Book of the <hi>Harmony of the Divine Attributes,</hi> &amp;c. So the
whole Import of that Phrase, as it hath been used by him,
and also by the most who have written with Care and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actness
on the <hi>subject</hi> of <hi>Christ's satisfaction,</hi> is no more than
what hath been Delivered by the <hi>Apostle,</hi> Gal. 4. 4, 5.
namely, that Christ becoming <hi>Mediator</hi> and <hi>Surety, was
made under the Law,</hi> both as to its <hi>Preceptive Part</hi> and its
<hi>Sanction,</hi> that he might Redeem them that were under the
Law: And that as he fulfilled the <hi>Directive Part</hi> of the
Law, by the <hi>Innocency</hi> and <hi>Obedience</hi> of his <hi>Life,</hi> he like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
underwent the <hi>Penalty</hi> of it in his <hi>Sufferings</hi> and <hi>Death.</hi>
Now so many Instances of a <hi>frothy</hi> and <hi>vain Mind</hi>
are scarcely to be met with in any Writing, nay not in it
commonly called <hi>Grubstreet,</hi> as this <hi>Theological Author</hi> upon
a <hi>subject</hi> relating to <hi>Divinity,</hi> and <hi>Articles</hi> of <hi>Christian
Belief,</hi> hath delivered, not only in a few <hi>Sheets,</hi> but almost
in every <hi>one</hi> of them. For the Ambition and Unity of Act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the <hi>Droll,</hi> has made him forget that he was either a <hi>Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:62502:20"/>
a <hi>Scholar,</hi> or a <hi>Divine.</hi> But tho True and Innocent
<hi>Wit,</hi> be both Estimable in it self, and is hearkned unto with
Respect and Deference, by all that have <hi>Genius</hi> and <hi>good
Relish;</hi> yet Boorish, ill Natur'd, and foolish <hi>Jests,</hi> will
recommend no man to such as are distinguish'd from the
Unthinking and Debauched <hi>Herd,</hi> and much less one that
is a <hi>Minister of the Gospel,</hi> the Grimaces and Mimicks
of a <hi>Baboon,</hi> would give better <hi>Divertisement,</hi> than
this <hi>Drolling,</hi> and Impure way of Writing; Those
being agreeable to his <hi>species,</hi> while the Latter is both a
Degrading, and a Disparaging of the <hi>Human</hi> kind, by act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a Part, which speaks a <hi>Metamorphosis</hi> of some of the
<hi>Intellectual Race</hi> into those <hi>Brutal</hi> Creatures, which seem
to have been purposely <hi>Fram</hi>'d to give <hi>Mirth</hi> and <hi>Sport.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to bestow some <hi>Reflections</hi> upon what I have rehear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
out of our Author, the first thing I would observe is,
that the little <hi>Wit</hi> that appears in any thing he has said, is
perfectly <hi>Antiquated,</hi> and out of <hi>Date. Chaucer</hi>'s <hi>obsolete</hi>
English would sooner be accounted Elegant and Rhetorical
among the <hi>Politest</hi> Masters of our Refin'd and Modern
Language, than these <hi>Puns, Quibles</hi> and <hi>Drollings</hi> of an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fantill,
unpolish'd Age will pass, and be admitted for
Schemes of Maturated, Adult, and Pregnant <hi>Wit.</hi> And
to <hi>Address</hi> the World in such a <hi>Style</hi> is more Ridiculous,
than for a <hi>Beau</hi> to go to Court in <hi>Trunck Breeches</hi> and a
<hi>Gorillo;</hi> or for a <hi>Lady</hi> that valueth her self upon <hi>Fashiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleness</hi>
of <hi>Attire,</hi> and the Genteelest <hi>mean</hi> of <hi>Dress,</hi> to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
her self in the Royal Presence, with a <hi>Kercher,</hi> or an
Old <hi>Elizabeth Fardingal.</hi> It is likewise <hi>mean</hi> and <hi>Boorish,</hi>
borrowed from the <hi>Plough</hi> and <hi>Harrow,</hi> rather than from
either a <hi>Palace,</hi> or an <hi>Academy;</hi> And would more become
the <hi>Rural Clown,</hi> than a <hi>Gentleman,</hi> or a <hi>Theologue,</hi> Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
besides what I have already repeated that Expression,
<hi>p.</hi> 102. where he calls all the <hi>Noise</hi> that hath been made
about Mr. <hi>Williams's Book of Gospel-Truth stated,</hi> a <hi>shearing
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:62502:21"/>
of Hogs.</hi> And that other Elegancy, <hi>p.</hi> 94 where to fasten
upon Mr. <hi>Lobb</hi> the Slaunder of having misrepresented him,
He phraseth it by his <hi>Extracting water out of Flint,</hi> and
<hi>by his being in Possession of an Engine that can find drayning
works on</hi> Salisbury <hi>Plain.</hi> In a word, all the Perfections of
<hi>Wit</hi> and Eloquence, which he valueth himself upon, and
seeketh Reputation from, are rather the <hi>Wit</hi> and <hi>Language</hi>
of <hi>Coblers</hi> and <hi>Tinkers;</hi> than either of a <hi>Fresh-man</hi> in the
<hi>Vniversity;</hi> or of a Common <hi>Trades-man</hi> in the <hi>City,</hi>
and much less of <hi>one</hi> that would be held a <hi>Virtuoso</hi> as
well as a Divine. And instead of having an Affinity
with what is Learned from the <hi>Muses,</hi> it is such as
people come to be Instructed in among <hi>Gypsies</hi> and <hi>Strollers,</hi>
or which would be held owing to an Education among those
whom both the <hi>Heathen Theology</hi> and <hi>Poetry</hi> made <hi>Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants</hi>
of the <hi>Woods,</hi> and which use to be Painted with <hi>Curled
Horns</hi> and <hi>Cloven Feet.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis also <hi>nasty</hi> and unclean, as if learned at the <hi>Tombrall,</hi>
and not where Persons of <hi>Vertue,</hi> or <hi>Breeding</hi> do come,
and Frequent. Neither doth his <hi>Vnderstanding</hi> seem to
be of the same <hi>Species,</hi> nor his <hi>sensible Faculties</hi> Resolvable
into the like <hi>Texture</hi> of <hi>Organs,</hi> that the rest of Human
kind are, in that <hi>Trifles</hi> and <hi>Stenches,</hi> which <hi>choake</hi> the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellects,
and <hi>offend</hi> the <hi>Senses</hi> of every one else, are in him
most grateful to the <hi>latter,</hi> and entertaining to the <hi>Former.</hi>
He would seem to have been either Born, or Bred in a <hi>Hog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty,</hi>
in that <hi>Dung</hi> and <hi>Ordure</hi> are more Agreeable, and
Odoriferous to his <hi>Olfactive</hi> Power, than either <hi>Musk</hi> or
<hi>Essences.</hi> And seeing he enquires of Mr. <hi>Lobb</hi> after, and
seems to want a Place, I would case him of the Friendly
service, which in that Particular he expects from him, and
would recommend him as the fittest and best Qualified <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didate</hi>
to be a <hi>Midnight Gold Gatherer,</hi> or an Emptier
of Houses of Office. For, if I may speak my Opinion
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:62502:21"/>
impartially of this man's Judgment and sense, he does rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon
it to be more <hi>Ornamental</hi> to be Drawn in a <hi>Dung-Cart,</hi>
than to Ride in a <hi>Triumphant Chariot.</hi> And his Flights of
<hi>Wit,</hi> and Flowers of <hi>Eloquence,</hi> are rather Burlesque, and
plain <hi>Ribaldry</hi> than handsome, and Innocent Raillery. And
when he comes forth <hi>Strutting</hi> in his Greatest <hi>Gaiety,</hi> it is
in the Manufacture of Prophaneness, and in the <hi>Colours</hi> of
<hi>smut,</hi> and Debauchery, and not in the <hi>Rayment</hi> and <hi>Garb</hi>
of Vertue, and good sense. His best <hi>Turns</hi> of Thought,
would hardly be tolerable in a <hi>Farce,</hi> but would upon no
<hi>Terms</hi> be allow'd in a <hi>Comedy.</hi> The best that can be said
both of his <hi>Wit,</hi> and skill is, that they are Entirely <hi>Scara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muchio,</hi>
and <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>arlaquin.</hi> Nor was the Writing about Divine
Truths, or the Preaching of the Gospel, ever intended to come
within the <hi>Circle</hi> of his Province; the whole that Nature
seems to have fitted, and therefore Design'd him unto,
being to appear in <hi>yellow,</hi> and <hi>Red</hi> (seeing he is Covetuous
of a Livery) to beget Laughter in the <hi>Mob,</hi> that stands gap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
about the <hi>Stage</hi> of a <hi>Mountebanck.</hi> Tho in the mean time
I'le crave Liberty to tell him, that whosoever he be whose
work, and the Top of Ambition, and the height of his Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
is to make others Laugh, is to make himself Ridiculous.
And as the <hi>Epithet</hi> of the <hi>Bird</hi> of <hi>Athens</hi> was given him
by a very Learned Person divers years ago, so he doth now
Appear to Deserve it, not only by reason of his being
more <hi>Feathers</hi> than <hi>Body,</hi> but because he ought never to
venture into the <hi>Light</hi> for fear of being houted at, but to
rest contented to live within the <hi>Curtains,</hi> and under the
<hi>Shades</hi> of the night; In that his coming abroad in the Day
is found as <hi>Ominous</hi> of Disgrace to all that own him, as his
<hi>Note,</hi> and <hi>Tune,</hi> by which he seeks to be thought melo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious,
is by all who have an <hi>Harmonious</hi> soul and a <hi>Musical</hi>
ear, turn'd into an occasion of Laughter, and of Pleasant
contempt. Nor will any <hi>Prescriptions</hi> be so proper and effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:62502:22"/>
to cure the <hi>Distemper</hi> he at present is affected with, and
Recover him from his <hi>Phrensy,</hi> as a <hi>Dark Lodging,</hi> and
<hi>Hogsden</hi> Discipline.</p>
            <p>But to Advance another <hi>Reflection,</hi> namely, that this
way of <hi>Writing</hi> is no way Agreeable to the <hi>Station,</hi> or
<hi>Character</hi> of a <hi>Minister</hi> of the <hi>Gospel,</hi> tho I will not say (but
that abstracted from the Office) it may be very Conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
to his. For, if the Qualifications Required by St. <hi>Paul</hi>
in a <hi>Presbyter,</hi> had been Attended to in his <hi>Admission,</hi> or
were the <hi>Terms</hi> of his <hi>Continuance</hi> in that <hi>sacred Order,</hi> it
would be matter of Enquiring how he came in, and by
what neglects he escapes being cast out. For if according
to St. <hi>Paul,</hi> it be an Indispensable Requisite, that such as
enter upon the Holy <hi>Office</hi> should be imbu'd with <hi>meekness</hi>
to <hi>Instruct those who oppose themselves</hi> to what the Church
entertains and believes, 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 25. And that they
should not be lifted <hi>up with Pride,</hi> lest they <hi>fall into the
Condemnation of the Devil;</hi> I do greatly fear, that Mr. <hi>Alsop</hi>
would neither have been the first Admitted; nor so long
since continued, if the scrutiny according to these measures
had been exact and Impartial. And if a <hi>Novice</hi> either in
Age or in the <hi>Profession</hi> of <hi>Christianity,</hi> was not to be <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrated</hi>
a <hi>Presbyter, lest he should fall into the Temptation</hi> of
<hi>the Devil,</hi> either by acting with that <hi>Insolency,</hi> which may
administer occasion to <hi>Sathan</hi> and his Instruments to <hi>Reproach</hi>
Religion, or dispose him to be a <hi>Calumniator</hi> of the <hi>Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,</hi>
as the <hi>Devil</hi> is Represented to be, or render him
incident to <hi>Pride,</hi> of which the <hi>Devil</hi> being the first <hi>Presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent</hi>
of <hi>Guilt,</hi> is sentenced, and condemned; surely then
<hi>one</hi> that is not only arrived at a <hi>mature</hi> Age, but is almost
<hi>Super annuated,</hi> and grown near to be <hi>Decripit,</hi> if he be found
to be a <hi>Reviler,</hi> and one of <hi>Luciferian Haughtiness</hi> and
<hi>Pride,</hi> he ought to be accounted lyable to severe Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures,
and Rebukes, tho he may through Indulgence
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:62502:22"/>
rather than Justice, escape being ejected from the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry.
And were it another Person than Mr. <hi>Alsop,</hi> it would
be both believ'd and said, that he must have come in by
the <hi>Window,</hi> and ought to have been dismiss'd and sent out
by the way of the <hi>Belfry.</hi> For granting, that he may <hi>Preach
Soberly,</hi> and <hi>well;</hi> yet if he <hi>write Immodestly,</hi> and with Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulancy,
the Contradiction between the one and the to'ther,
will not only obstruct the success, and hinder the effects of
the <hi>Former</hi> upon the Minds, and Consciences of Men, but
will tempt his Hearers and Readers to conclude, that
he only Personates, and Acts a part in <hi>that,</hi> while he
is <hi>Real,</hi> and <hi>sincere</hi> in the <hi>Latter.</hi> And they will <hi>Form</hi>
an <hi>Idea</hi> of the man from what they observe by the <hi>Organ</hi>
of the Eye, rather than from the <hi>Sounds</hi> Conveyed to them
by the <hi>Ear.</hi> To Assume the dignity, and to put on the Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity
of a <hi>Minister</hi> in the <hi>Pulpit,</hi> and to Act the <hi>Droll, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr</hi>
and <hi>Buffoon</hi> from the <hi>Press,</hi> will not only be accounted
both <hi>Moral</hi> and <hi>Theological Nonsense,</hi> and to be Designed to
make the <hi>Sacred Order Despicable</hi> and <hi>Ridiculous,</hi> but it
doth also Justify the Athestical, and Prophane in all their
Scoffs and <hi>Sarcasms</hi> upon those of the Holy <hi>Office;</hi> and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms
them in their Irreligious Opinion, that <hi>Preaching</hi>
and the work of the <hi>Pulpit</hi> is only <hi>Priest craft,</hi> calculated
and taken up to Cheat others, to Reconcile Reverence to
themselves, and to gain a Livelihood, and no ways upheld
and Practic'd for the making People either better Men,
more social Neighbours, or firmer in their Loyalty to their
Prince. Of all sides, one in the <hi>Pulpit</hi> to day, and to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
upon the <hi>Stage,</hi> which is most <hi>Ludicrous,</hi> as well as <hi>Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comely.</hi>
And to lay aside both the <hi>Bible</hi> and the long <hi>Cloak,</hi>
and to put on <hi>Buskins,</hi> can only be diverting to those,
who are not only void of Religion, but Destitute of good
sense. And it must be much more Disgustful, and Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive
to see one <hi>Disrobe</hi> himself of the <hi>Black Habit,</hi> and
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:62502:23"/>
               <hi>Narrow Band,</hi> and to come forth either in the strait <hi>Attire</hi> to
Vault, upon the High <hi>Ropes,</hi> or to appear in the <hi>Party Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loured
Cap,</hi> and <hi>Coat,</hi> to Act the <hi>Jack Pudding</hi> on a <hi>Mounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bank-stall,</hi>
or <hi>Stage,</hi> than it would be to behold a <hi>Minister</hi>
of <hi>State</hi> going about the Street <hi>Crying Mackaral,</hi> or Matches.
An <hi>Ecclesiastical Droll</hi> is more Ridiculous than for my
<hi>Lord</hi> Chief <hi>Justice</hi> of <hi>England</hi> to turn <hi>Bully.</hi> And God is
more Dishonoured by the <hi>Former,</hi> than Authority is Degra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
and made Contemptible by the <hi>Latter.</hi> For the highest
Flights of <hi>Wit,</hi> with the best Turns of <hi>Thought,</hi> and
Schemes of <hi>Eloquence</hi> be not expected from every <hi>Preacher;</hi>
yet there is no man who doth not Indispensably exact from
them a few <hi>Grains</hi> of good Nature and <hi>Modesty.</hi> And
where these are met with, accompanied with Decency,
<hi>Gravity,</hi> and seriousness they do Excuse, and will be Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
as Apologies for many other Deficiencies. But
while those stiled <hi>Ecclesiasticks,</hi> do by <hi>Bagatel, Ribaldry,</hi> and
<hi>Virulence,</hi> Disgrace as well as Depart from the <hi>Decorum</hi>
of their <hi>Station,</hi> they must not expect, but that they
will be treated with a severity that would be thought Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mannerly
toward others, if it could be Judged Pardonable.
In brief, it is pity that Dr. <hi>Echard</hi> is Dead, there being
more occasion, and matter given in two <hi>Pamphlets</hi> of Mr.
<hi>Alsops,</hi> for writing <hi>Volumn's</hi> of the <hi>Contempt</hi> of the Clergy
than that Author could furnish his <hi>Adversaries</hi> with some
years ago, towards the <hi>Equipping</hi> a Book, (that I may make
bold with an Elegancy of Mr. <hi>Alsops)</hi> bearing that <hi>Title</hi>
and with a <hi>Cargo</hi> of that kind.</p>
            <p>Again, the way of writing, whereof I have given from
him self the <hi>Copy,</hi> and <hi>Pattern,</hi> is altogether Unsuitable
to the subject he was treatning of, Proportion and Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
are what not only give the Agreeableness, but the
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:62502:23"/>
Beauty to Things both of Nature and Art. And ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the <hi>Grandure,</hi> or the <hi>meanness</hi> of the <hi>subject,</hi>
should our Thoughts be more Elevated, or Depressed,
and our <hi>Language</hi> stately, or humble. For tho there be
common <hi>Rules</hi> for our Conduct in <hi>Rhetorick,</hi> as well
as in <hi>Syntax,</hi> yet the Application of them is to be
wonderfully Diversifyed in Compliance with the Nature of
the <hi>subject.</hi> And as no man Conversant in this matter will
take the Eloquence of the <hi>Aula,</hi> and the <hi>Curia</hi> to be the
same, in that the Affairs at <hi>Kensington</hi> and <hi>Westminister
Hall</hi> being vastly Different, do call for Dissonant <hi>Turns</hi> of
Thought and Respective <hi>Schemes</hi> of Eloquution, and Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage;
so there is an <hi>Oratory</hi> Peculiar to Theological mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
which hath little Affinity with either of them, and
much less any thing meaner. And while these from whom
he differs are of Equal Parts and Industry with himself, and
from great Integrity do believe themselves in the Right in
those Theological Articles, which the Dogmatical and Haugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and such as are govern'd by secular Interest are not very
likely to be, it is the least deference that can be paid them,
to examine their Opinions modestly, and not to Lampoon
them. To talk or write jocularly and by way of <hi>Travesty</hi>
of doctrines, and things alledged to have their foundation in
divine Revelation, is to despise and vilify the Authority of
God, and to detract from the Credit of his Declarations. And
if the least Corrupt Communication, <hi>i. e. nasty</hi> or <hi>Vnclean,</hi> as
the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> doth import, be forbidden every Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
in his most divertive discourse, <hi>Ep.</hi> 4. 29. it must
then be far from being Innocent or Comely in a Minister
of the Gospel, especially when the subject is not Common,
and Trivial, but weighty and Religious. To write of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
of Faith with a wantonness and Impurity of stile
that would be thought nasty and indecent in a <hi>Ballad,</hi> is
to Burlesque Religion, and to bring a Contempt upon the
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:62502:24"/>
doctrines of Revelation. For if we will hearken to the
Advice or Imitate the Example of the Apostles, the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
wherein Theological Truths should be conveyed
either to the Eye or Ear, should be <hi>plain</hi> and <hi>lowly,</hi> tho
withal neat and pure, and not Terms of <hi>swelling Vanity,</hi> or
the <hi>Bombast</hi> of <hi>Sophisters,</hi> or the <hi>Cant</hi> of <hi>Demogogues,</hi> and
much less in words of Ribaldry and nastiness. 'Tis to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
Religion, and without a great deal of Charity must
be thought so designed, to manage the Controversies of it,
either in the <hi>Billingsgate</hi> stile or in that of the <hi>Play-House.</hi>
What might pass as harmless <hi>Raillery</hi> on another subject,
is Tarlequin and <hi>Lewdness</hi> on a divine <hi>Theme.</hi> And the
Modestest thing that can be said of it, is, that it is not only
the bringing the most awfull and august Truths into the
same <hi>Levell</hi> with <hi>Trifles,</hi> but it is the Lessening their Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
over the Consciences of men by cloathing them in a
<hi>Ludicrous Dress.</hi> For a King would be more houted at
should he appear in the Attire of a <hi>Jack Pudding,</hi> than
the meanest Fellow would be in the same <hi>Habit.</hi> Nor
can it be thought less than a Burlesquing of the Bible,
and a Lampooning whatsoever is <hi>Sacred,</hi> to Compare
Christ's entering into the same Bond with us (in the
sence before specified) with the <hi>pacta Conventa</hi> of <hi>Poland,</hi>
and to the <hi>Chymerical Original Contract</hi> Romantically fancied
by some to have been between the <hi>Kings</hi> of <hi>England</hi> and the
<hi>Community</hi> upon the first erection of the <hi>Monarchy.</hi> And
of the like excessive Flight of profaneness, as well as of
shameful unsuitableness to divine Truths is that other Expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of Mr. <hi>Alsop's,</hi> p. 140. where having Slandered a Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend
Minister who is a faithful and successful <hi>preacher</hi> of the
<hi>Gospel,</hi> in reference to a Story maliciously invented of
him by the <hi>Atheistical</hi> and Impious Drolls of the Town, and
for which Unbrotherly, Unchristian, Ungentlemanly and
Lying Defamation, I do purpose anon to call him to an
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:62502:24"/>
account; he adds, that he would not for a <hi>Groat</hi> run the
Hazard of Dropping into the <hi>Bottomless Pit;</hi> which I do
think, and would likewise hope that his best Friends will
not avoid to call unpardonable <hi>Levity</hi> in a matter that
should never be spoken of but with profound seriousness.
The different <hi>Fates</hi> of an <hi>Eternity</hi> to come, are the <hi>Pillars</hi>
upon which <hi>Wisdom</hi> hath erected its <hi>House;</hi> And to turn
<hi>Hell</hi> into a <hi>Jest</hi> is to undermine the divine Government,
thro making the judicial Tribunal of God, and the Rectoral
sentences of the Supream and Righteous judge, the subject
of sport and Mirth. Yea, it is to treat the <hi>Bible</hi> in worse
<hi>Ridicule</hi> than a discreet man would do the <hi>Alcoran</hi> of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet,
in that it prostituteth that into matter of diversion
and Laughter, which the Scripture hath so fully revealed in
order to beget dread and fear. For if it be not worth more
than the Expence of a <hi>Groat</hi> to <hi>avoid Damnation,</hi> the <hi>Torments</hi>
of the <hi>Infernal Pit.</hi> must be very <hi>Slight,</hi> if not wholly <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantick:</hi>
seeing it is Impossible that a state and Condition
should be either terrible or dolorous, which a Person whose
Character both supposed him to know and maketh it his duty
to acquaint others with it, would not part with above
a <hi>Groat</hi> to Escape. And it is but congruous, and therefore
not uncharitable to Believe of him, that he would not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burse
more to <hi>Purchase Heaven,</hi> than he hath fixed the Price
of <hi>avoiding Hell.</hi> In a word, if his Heaven be not more
desireable than his <hi>Hell</hi> is Ftightful, the <hi>Hades,</hi> of the <hi>Pagans</hi>
was less to be dreaded, and the <hi>Paradise</hi> of the <hi>Turks</hi> is equally
valuable with the Infernal miseries and the Celestial Bliss,
which are Revealed, Described, and proposed to our Faith
in the Bible, as the great and proper <hi>meanes</hi> to work upon
our <hi>Hopes</hi> and <hi>Fears,</hi> which are the two signal Handles
and <hi>Machines</hi> graven upon and woven into our Intectual Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
in order to our being restrained from Vice and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety,
and quickned to Virtue and Holy Obedience, without
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:62502:25"/>
the doing violence to our Faculties and Moral Powers, or
the Invading that Liberty and Freedom of Choice which
distinguishes us from the Brutal Race, gives the moral Speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
to our Actions, rendring them denominable, good
or bad, and which makes them capable of Punishment and
Reward.</p>
            <p>The last <hi>Reflection</hi> which I will advance under this Head,
is, That his Wit and Stile are no ways proportioned to the
Quality and Manners of those to whom his Book is addres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
and for whom he would be thought not only to have
provided Entertainment, but to have design'd their Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.
For though (that every thing in his Book might be
of a peice; and all equally preposterous, uncomely and ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regular)
the <hi>Epistle</hi> to the <hi>Reader</hi> be the <hi>Epilogue</hi> in his
<hi>Play,</hi> instead of the <hi>Prologue:</hi> and the <hi>Reader postponed from
the Preface to the Postscript;</hi> and as he further not only fanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stically
phraseth it, <hi>from the Van to the Rear:</hi> but as he Boor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ishly
and Buffoonly words it, <hi>degraded from riding in State on
the Fore-horse, to come behind with the Postman,</hi> &amp;c. p. 243.
Yet I suppose he thought he had adapted it to the Genius,
Humour and Relish of People of Condition, Learning, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity,
and of some Christian Vertue; and not have cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated
it for the <hi>Meridian</hi> of <hi>Billing sgate,</hi> or to have prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
and dressed it to the Palat and Savour of the Atheistical
<hi>Debanchees,</hi> and the Prophane <hi>Mob.</hi> Whereas in this, as in
every thing else of the <hi>Pamphlet,</hi> his Understanding being
over-ruled by his Pride, Passion and Revenge, has misled
him into a mistake of the <hi>Canailler</hi> for the <hi>Nobless;</hi> of the
<hi>Illiterate Herd</hi> for the <hi>Tribe</hi> of those of <hi>Erudition;</hi> and of
the <hi>Graceless</hi> and <hi>Impious</hi> in the room of such as are strictly
Moral and Religious.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="41" facs="tcp:62502:25"/>
Reverend Sir, I need not tell you, that every one who
writes a Book, invites his Readers to a Feast, and that the
<hi>Entertainment</hi> ought to be suited to the Condition of the
<hi>Guests;</hi> and that the <hi>Viands</hi> should not only be propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionate
to the Quality of those that are invited, in the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and plenty of them, but in the Cookery also: And that
as the meat ought to be the best of the kind which the purse
of the Host can rise unto; so that likewise the dishes and Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen
should be clean; and the <hi>sawce</hi> such as may be both <hi>grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi>
to the <hi>senses,</hi> and <hi>whet</hi> the <hi>Appetite;</hi> and not be nause<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
to the Latter, and offensive to the former.</p>
            <p>The droppings of a Candle into Cold Water, or the
Broth of Fat <hi>Bacon</hi> may be a delicious <hi>pottage,</hi> and <hi>clean Straw</hi>
an obliging and well furnished <hi>Bed,</hi> to a <hi>Gypsy</hi> or a <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Stroller;</hi> but they would not be accounted an Agreeable
and a Genteel <hi>Diet,</hi> nor a decent <hi>Accommodation</hi> for persons
distinguished from the <hi>Vulgar</hi> as well as above the Indigencies
of those who have neither Food nor Harbour, but what
are charitably vouchsafed them. And tho <hi>Coarseness</hi> of <hi>Diet</hi>
served up at Table may be pardonable in a person that pleads
penury, albeit it be hardly justifiable to have the Vanity to
Invite the most Fashionable of his Friends and Acquaintance
to it; yet no man will forgive the mixing of <hi>Ratsbane</hi> to
that degree in his <hi>food,</hi> as will infallibly <hi>poison</hi> all that partake
of it, unless they have powerfull <hi>Antidotes</hi> about them, or
by a long accustomed <hi>Mithridatical</hi> diet be habitually and
strongly fortified against all Infection. And to use Coarse
and Uncomely Language in a discourse directed to people
of degree and Gravity, is not only to affront, but to debase
them. 'Tis to despise the worth and detract from the value
of people of merit and Breeding, for one that hath good
Raiment by him, to make them a solemn and Ceremonious
visit in Nastiness and Raggs. For tho that Garb may be
dispensed with in a Beggar that comes for an <hi>Alms,</hi> and hath
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:62502:26"/>
no better cloaths to put on (albeit even in such it is not so
much the <hi>Poverty</hi> of their <hi>Weeds</hi> as the stench that digu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steth)
yet it deserves to be chastized as well as Blamed,
when it is found to be worn by any, not out of want, but
to shew their own Cynical and Clownish Pride, and the
Contempt which they have for their Superiors as well as their
Equals. But that which upon this occasion I would more
especially Remark, is what <hi>Idea</hi> Mr. <hi>Alsop</hi>'s writing in this
Jocular, wanton, and Impure stile, to <hi>Ministers</hi> and mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of <hi>dissenting</hi> Churches, must be thought to give both
of the <hi>Intectuals</hi> and <hi>Morals</hi> of those Pastors and people. For
seeing the <hi>size</hi> of Men's <hi>Vnderstandings,</hi> and the <hi>Quality</hi> of
their <hi>manners,</hi> are more discerned by their <hi>Relish</hi> and <hi>plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures,</hi>
than by any other <hi>Diagnosticks</hi> whatsoever; it must
Consequently proclaim the <hi>Presbyterian Teachers,</hi> as well as
those that sit under their <hi>Instruction,</hi> to be very ill furnished
with good sense, wholly strangers to good Breeding, and
vastly removed from Virtuous manners, if the <hi>Wit</hi> and
<hi>Language</hi> which I am Reflecting upon, can be allowed, or so
much as Connived at by them. And whatsoever thoughts
they may entertain of themselves, and of one Another; yet
I dare say, that upon his alone <hi>Test,</hi> all they of other perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
will form a judgment of what, little Genteel learning,
refined wit, honourable Education, and practical Religion is
among them. For if they do but either justify or Excuse,
and much more if they find a pleasing Gust and a Relishing
savour in the <hi>Wit</hi> and <hi>Language</hi> which I have Rehearsed, it
will Authorize others to pronounce of them, that they are
not only a dull and Insipid sort of people, but that they
have neither Grace nor Modesty: And that their Non-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity
to the Established Worship and Discipline, is not
from their being wiser and more Conscientious, than other
men, but from their Ignorance Peevishness, and ill humour, if
not upon worse Motives. For there is more to affront the
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:62502:26"/>
minds, shock the Sobriety and Virtue, and to fully and defile
the Consciences of men, in this Book of Mr. <hi>Alsops</hi> than there is
either in the <hi>Liturgy, Litany, Ceremonies,</hi> the three or four
scrupled <hi>Articles</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> or in all the
Parts and <hi>Branches</hi> of their disciplinarian and <hi>Ecclesiastical
Administration.</hi> So that the <hi>Pastors</hi> who meet at St. <hi>Hellen</hi>'s,
as likewise their Auditors, must reckon what Character they
will undoubtedly lye under, unless by some publick Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,
they declare their Abhorrence of this Buffoonry of
wit, and lewdness, as well as petulancy and scurrility of stile.
Which whether they will do, by driving the <hi>Blown Deer</hi> out
of the <hi>Herd,</hi> and by putting the <hi>Mangy Sheep</hi> apart from the
rest, lest the Infection reach unto the whole <hi>Flock,</hi> or by
what other means and methods may be Esteemed most Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
for their own Vindication, from all accesson to Mr.
<hi>Alsops</hi> prophaneness of wit, and Impurity of Language;
I do Leave to their Consideration at their next <hi>meeting.</hi> For
the Question is not now (at least so far as at this time I hold
my self intercessed in it) what Opinions of an Alliance not
only with <hi>Armimianism,</hi> but with <hi>Socinianism,</hi> some <hi>Presbyterians</hi>
may entertain, nor to what distance they are removed from
the commonly received <hi>doctrine</hi> of <hi>protestants;</hi> but whether
in order to Mr. <hi>Alsop</hi>'s being thought witty and Eloquent,
the <hi>smuttiness</hi> and <hi>Impiety</hi> of <hi>Billingsgate</hi> and of the <hi>Mounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banck
Stage,</hi> are to be received into the Catalogue of their
Ministerial perfections, and adopted into the Morality and
Manners of the <hi>Members</hi> of <hi>Presbyterian</hi> societies. And thus
have I at length dispatched the foregoing Accusation against
Mr. <hi>Alsop,</hi> tho with a tediousness that I will not strictly and
punctiliously justify, and for the prolixity whereof I design
(if it be practicable) a Compensation in my Brevity in those
further Impeachments of him, which remain to be Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="44" facs="tcp:62502:27"/>
I shall now therefore proceed to the charging him with
great <hi>Insincerity,</hi> in what he hath alledged, both in reference
to <hi>Persons</hi> and <hi>Things.</hi> And without envying <hi>him</hi> or Mr.
<hi>Williams</hi> the luscious <hi>Complements</hi> and the lofty <hi>Paenegyricks,</hi>
which they bestow upon one another, but leaving them to
the enjoyment of those pleasures which are mutually designed
by their <hi>Reciprocal Flatteries;</hi> I will only affirm that much of
what both of them have said, is a <hi>disguizing of themselves,</hi>
and a <hi>Misrepresenting</hi> of Mr. <hi>L.</hi> and that their way of writing
is Disingenuous, and the matters which they suggest palpably
<hi>False.</hi> And as Mr. <hi>Alsop</hi> knew Mr. <hi>Lobb</hi> to be perfectly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent
of those things which he Criminally accuseth him of,
so the whole he intended by those Imputations, was only
to furnish himself with an Occasion and pretence of being
<hi>Rude</hi> and <hi>Vnmannerly.</hi> As I heartily wish there may not be
many <hi>Ecclesiasticks</hi> in Britrain, in whom is verified the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine
Adage</hi> of <hi>Odium Theologicum,</hi> i.e. that the Hatred which one
<hi>Divine</hi> bears to <hi>another</hi> is both more <hi>causeless</hi> and <hi>Implacable,</hi>
than what is found among others of any Quality, character
and denomination soever; so I hope <hi>he</hi> and his <hi>Brother Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liams</hi>
are the only persons, in whom is justified the <hi>Italian
Proverb</hi> of <hi>Conscienza di Theologo,</hi> namely, <hi>that the Conscience
of a Theologue, is less than any Man's, under the Confinement of
the Rules of Religion, justice, and good manners:</hi> It hath been
hitherto accounted the duty of every honest man, to speak
and write, as he thinks, and believes: And hath been also
esteemed a piece of Morality as well as of good Breeding,
for a Person that is virtuous or discreet to avoid every <hi>officious
lye,</hi> by which he may serve himself, or create sport to
others, and much more to shun a <hi>malicious</hi> one, tho the
Consequence of it be never so Trivial, and that it bring no
Considerable Damage upon him that is Slander'd. To throw
dirt is a Clownish way of Fighting, and becomes no man
that lays claim to the Ability and Art of Weilding a Pen.
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:62502:27"/>
For one that calls Himself a Scholar, to fasten Opinions
upon an Adversary, without other Ground or Reason,
save the seeking an occasion of Combating of Him, is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the part of the <hi>Brave</hi> or <hi>Learned,</hi> but of the <hi>Coward,</hi>
the <hi>Knave,</hi> or the <hi>Madman.</hi> And the best that will be said
of it by the Wise, Virtuous, and Impartial is, that it is
only one's buckling on his Armour to Encounter the <hi>Wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mills</hi>
in his own <hi>Brains.</hi> Now as to the <hi>Insincerity</hi> of Mr.
<hi>Williams,</hi> either in his Concealing his own Opinions, or the
bringing them forth in <hi>Masquerade</hi> and <hi>Disguise;</hi> or in his
<hi>Transforming</hi> and <hi>Metamorphosing</hi> the Opinions of others
into <hi>Forms</hi> and <hi>Shapes,</hi> Forreign unto, and <hi>specifically</hi> dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
from what they are in their <hi>Genuine</hi> and <hi>Nat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ral
Features;</hi> I shall adjourn the consideration of it at this
time, intending, if the occasion of it continue, to give him
full satisfaction hereafter, with an Allowance of Interest
for the forbearance in point of Payment, which I do now
demand. But I am told, that the Learned, Grave, plain
hearted and upright, Mr. <hi>Humphreys,</hi> is about saving me
and others that Labour, who as he has had better opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities
of knowing the Man and his Sentiments, than I will
Boast of, so none do understand better than that Ancient
Person, how to Disrobe him of his Vizor Mask, and the
rest of his <hi>Theatrical Habit,</hi> and to shew him in his own
Colours. For tho' that Ancient and Learned Divine, be
himself Guilty of some Aberrations from the commonly
received Doctrine of Protestants, yet because of his dissen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
from others with Meekness, Humility and Modesty
in himself, and with respect and deference, as well as with
Charity towards them; he is therefore Notwithstanding
his Errors, had in all due Esteem and Veneration, even by
those that do both most oppose and dislike his Opinions;
which are only Accounted the Infirmities of his understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
the mistakes of his Judgment, but no wise the
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:62502:28"/>
Faults of his will, or the Blemishes of his Conscience.
But as to Mr. <hi>Alsop</hi>'s Insincerity; In Relation to what he
hath written both of Persons and Things, I do take the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusing
and Reprimanding of Him for it, to fall within the
Province which I have undertaken: And which, I shall
therefore uncontroulably justify by <hi>Quotations</hi> out of his
own <hi>Books.</hi> Of this kind is, his Fallely and Maliciously
mis-representing, Mr. <hi>Lobb,</hi> as if he, <hi>out of the Account
which he gave of the substance of the Gospel, had Expunged
Regeneration, Conversion, Repentance, Holiness, Sanctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
a new Heart, new Obedience and Good works; and that he
had discarded Faith from any concern in the Justification of
a Sinner, and made it unnecessary to our Vnion with Christ,
that so we might have an Interest in his Righteousness,</hi>
p. 4. <hi>And that thereupon he is Metamorphosed from an Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peraspistes
of Truth, into an Hector for the</hi> Antinomian <hi>Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors,
so easy is the Conversion of an Hector into a Ranter,</hi> p 5.
While in the mean time, he knew the whole of this Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation
to be Altogether Groundless and purely Romantick,
and Consequently to be highly defamatory and Slanderous,
and not becoming any one that pretendeth either to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
or to Moral Honesty. From which Unchristian,
as well as Uncivil and rude <hi>Misrepresentation,</hi> Mr. <hi>Lobb</hi>
having fully vindicated Himself beyond the possibility of
Mr. <hi>Alsops</hi> replying, tho (I would say of him were he not
called a Minister of the Gospel that) his <hi>Forehead</hi> is <hi>Brass
double gilt,</hi> and his <hi>Vnderstanding,</hi> as to one great part of
it's Function <hi>Callous</hi> and <hi>Dedolent.</hi> The whole which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains
incumbent upon me, will be in a Reflection or two
anon, to provide a chain and <hi>Muzzle</hi> for this <hi>Mastiff,</hi> and
to give him the Correction that is due to one who hath
turn'd his study (whatsoever he hath done his Pulpit) into
a <hi>Calumny office.</hi> Of the like Complexion and dye with
the foregoing falshood, is that barefaced and Impudent
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:62502:28"/>
calumniation of all those divines, as well as of Mr. <hi>Lobb,</hi>
who have called Mr. <hi>William</hi>'s Orthodoxy in some parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars
into Question, which the Reader may find on the
<hi>File</hi> of his Book, <hi>p.</hi> 35. Where, after his Huffing and <hi>Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular</hi>
manner, and with the assurance of a <hi>Knight of the
Post,</hi> he says, <hi>That he is confident that whatever has been the
pretence, the real cause of all the Enmity manifested against
Mr.</hi> Williams'<hi>s Book of Gospel-Truth, was cheifly, that it
gave a Mortal wound to</hi> Antinomian <hi>Opinions: And that,
that is a Crime, which shall never be forgiven him, but Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuted
with Vatinian hatred by the Reporter, and all of the
same Kidney.</hi> Which is, not only an Accusing a Great
Number of very Holy and Orthodox Divines (for they
are not a few who have testified their dislike of Divine
things in that Book of Mr. <hi>Williams</hi>'s) of being tainted
with, and Patrons of <hi>Antinomianism;</hi> But it is the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigning
them as Guilty of the Vilest <hi>Hypocrisie,</hi> thro'
their Alledging other Reasons, as the Motives of their dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>satisfaction
with it, when the real cause was it's having gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
a <hi>Mortal wound to Antinomian Opinions.</hi> Nor doth he
only hereby pretend to have gotten that <hi>Window</hi> into other
Men's <hi>Breasts,</hi> which neither King <hi>James</hi>'s Prerogative
nor Power could give him in reference to Mr. <hi>Alsop</hi>'s, tho'
he Complementally, <hi>i. e.</hi> deceitfully wished it him; but
he hath usurped the <hi>Tribunal</hi> and Seated himself in the
<hi>Throne</hi> of the <hi>Omniscient,</hi> thro' assuming to have an <hi>Intui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi>
knowledge of the <hi>Hearts</hi> of Men, and to have obtained a
view of their Intentions and Thoughts, not only without the
assistance of the <hi>Mediums</hi> and <hi>Organs</hi> of Intellectual sight; but
in despight of, and contradiction unto all the <hi>means</hi> of Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence,
which God hath furnished us with, and <hi>staked</hi> us
down unto, in our knowing and judging of others. Upon
which I will also, <hi>en passant,</hi> further observe, that it is not
<hi>one</hi> or <hi>two</hi> of the <hi>Congregational Brethren,</hi> whom he here
accuseth of <hi>Antinomianism,</hi> but it is the Bulk and Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:62502:29"/>
of that Party, (tho' he calls Mr. <hi>Lob</hi>'s charging him
with it a <hi>Nuisance and an Invidious Mis-representation of
Him,</hi> p. 23) Seeing in a manner the whole Body of the
<hi>Congregational Ministers,</hi> have signified their dissatisfaction
with many Notions in that Book of Mr. <hi>Williams</hi>'s. And
as for the Complement there, which he bestows upon <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of those Brethren, of his knowing them to be sound in the
Faith, and wholly remote from all Antinomian Tincture,</hi> It is
all but <hi>Banter</hi> and <hi>Grimace,</hi> or if spoken in earnest, doth
only shew that the Man was <hi>Delirous</hi> and <hi>Raving,</hi> thro'
the Height and Power of Distemper, in that he could nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
think nor write Coherently, and that his Quarrelling
with and contradicting others, is to be the more dispensed
with, in that the Nature of his disease will not allow him
to agree with himself. The several <hi>Paragraphs</hi> in his
Book are like my <hi>Lord Roscommon</hi>'s <hi>Cocks,</hi> which tho' rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned
all of one side, do when taken out of their several
and respective <hi>Cribs,</hi> Encounter and Destroy on another.
Nor is he only at Variance and Discord with Himself, by
reason, that what he hath written of late in Favour and
Vindication of Mr. <hi>Williams,</hi> is altogether Irreconcileable
with what he wrote several years ago in opposition to Dr.
<hi>Sherlock,</hi> and that the two Poles may as soon meet, as what
he hath delivered in his <hi>Antisozzo</hi> then, and now in his
<hi>Faithful Rebuke and the Vindication of it,</hi> be brought to
Harmonize and Agree; but in that there are Divers
things in each of his late <hi>Pamphlets,</hi> which are perfectly
contradictious and subversive of one another. The Man
being of one mind in the <hi>Intervals</hi> of his <hi>Paroxisms,</hi> and
when under his <hi>Lucida;</hi> and of another mind, when in
his <hi>Phrenzy</hi> and <hi>Fits</hi> of Distraction. But to proceed to
other <hi>Instances</hi> of his <hi>Insincerity,</hi> whereof the next shall be
his Accusing of Mr. <hi>Lobb,</hi> as if he were not now of the
same sentiments in several material Points of Theology,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:62502:29"/>
which he was heretofore, and that what he asserted and
maintained about Seventeen Years ago, in a Book which he
then wrote against <hi>Antinomianism,</hi> call'd, <hi>The Glory of Free
Grace display'd,</hi> were both departed from, and overthrown,
in what he hath lately published, as well in his Account, stil'd
<hi>the Report,</hi> as in those Papers, intituled, <hi>the Defence of it;</hi>

warped him; change<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in Dependencies perverted him; new
Friends and Alliances begat in him new Counsels, or an implacable
Hatred against</hi> Mr. Williams, <hi>obliged him to alter his Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
in meer spight, and to face about to the other Extream: And
that if they came from the same Mint, the Report has wretchedly
clipt what the Display had coyned; and the Display is now splay'd,</hi> p.
26, 27. In which Passages, besides the foppish and ridiculous
<hi>Puns,</hi> the nauseous and undesent <hi>Drolling,</hi> and Fantastick <hi>Pedan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,</hi>
in his way of expressing himself, there is the height of
Insincerity, Detraction, and Calumny. Nor could Mr.
<hi>Alsop</hi> assume this Licentiousness of Traducing him in a
matter of such Importance in it self, and whereof the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief,
if admitted, must wonderfully hinder the Success of
his ministry, without doing Violence to his own Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
as well as transgressing the Laws both of Justice
and Charity. Seeing of all the Pastors in and about the
Town, there is not one (and that to Mr. <hi>Alsop</hi>'s own know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge)
who hath more endeavour'd to put a Discountenance
upon all <hi>Antinomian</hi> Notions, than he hath done. And
tho' he can neither apply that Character and Denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to every one, whom Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> is pleased so to
mis-call, (that he may the better thereby disguise and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
his own Vergencies both to <hi>Socinianism</hi> and <hi>Arminia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nism,</hi>
and weaken their Credit in reference to Accusations
of those kinds, which they advance agaist him) nor can
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:62502:30"/>
pronounce every one to be an <hi>Antinomian,</hi> who ascribes
more to Christ in the Work of <hi>Satisfaction,</hi> and to his <hi>Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diential
Righteousness</hi> in the <hi>Justification</hi> of Believers, than
our new <hi>Refiners,</hi> upon the <hi>Covenant</hi> of <hi>Works,</hi> and of
<hi>Grace,</hi> will allow; yet if a Judgment may be formed of
him, either by his <hi>Books</hi> which I have read, or by his
<hi>Sermons,</hi> whereof I have had particular Accounts convey'd
to me by those that attend upon them, or by his <hi>Oral Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses,</hi>
both in the Assemblies of Ministers; and in more
private Conversation there is not one, either of the <hi>Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical</hi>
Order, or of the number of <hi>Laicks,</hi> Professors of the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Religion</hi> in this Nation, who is less <hi>Tinctur'd</hi> with an
<hi>Antinomian Dye,</hi> or at a farther Distance from approving their
foppish, unreasonable, and <hi>Anti-Evangelical Tenets,</hi> than
Mr. <hi>Lobb,</hi> both is, and hath always been known to be:
whereof Mr. <hi>Alsop</hi> was not only fully inform'd by others,
as appears from what he hath recorded in his own Book,
p. 37. of a Friend of his, and Mr. <hi>L. telling him that the
Author of the Report was no more an Antinomian than himself;</hi>
but he was likewise abundantly convinced of it in his own
Conscience, as well thro an antient and long Familiarity,
which they had together, as by a Perusal of what he had
declared in all his publick Writings. So that neither his
Acknowledgment, <hi>P.</hi> 43. that Mr. <hi>Lobb is now become more
Orthodox, than when he wrote his Report.</hi> Now his having
said, <hi>P. 37. That his Charity inclined him to think he was no
Antinomian,</hi> will not in the least extenuate, but does rather
greatly aggravate and enhance the Guilt of the foremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd
Defamatory Slander. And what he there delivers
as an <hi>Apology,</hi> is a proof of his <hi>Criminalness.</hi> Seeing his Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legation
of his <hi>preaching one thing, and printing another; of his
being one Man in the Pulpit, and another from the Press,</hi> &amp;c.
is not only gross Calumny towards Mr. <hi>Lobb,</hi> but pure Ficti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:62502:30"/>
in Mr. <hi>Alsop</hi>'s Interest, and is at present his Duty, to
consider to whom the Character and Denomination doth
belong, of being <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the <hi>Accuser of the Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren;</hi>
which Title seems to be ascrib'd unto the Devil in
the Place which I have my Eye upon, because of the many
false and flanderous Accusations fastned upon the <hi>Christians,</hi>
under the <hi>Pagan Persecutions,</hi> of which they were altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
innocent; so he ought to dread the <hi>Fate</hi> to which <hi>Back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biters,
Lyars,</hi> and <hi>Slanderers,</hi> are adjudged both in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree,
and in the <hi>Judicial Sentence</hi> of the Righteous God.
Nor possibly should I in any measure depart from Moral
Truth, if I should both suspect and pronounce Mr. <hi>Alsop</hi>'s
Book to have been stuff'd with those defamatory Slanders
of the <hi>Congregational Brethren,</hi> and written with that Acri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
and Malice, which appear in every <hi>Page</hi> of it, in
prospect of, and in subserviency to the raising a <hi>Persecution</hi>
against them, which some Men's Counsels, as well as Hearts,
are pregnant with, whensoever, thro' the Favour and Assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of the <hi>Latitudinarian Divines</hi> of the <hi>Church of England;</hi>
they can obtain a <hi>Comprehension,</hi> and be placed on the same Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom,
in relation to <hi>Parochial</hi> Settlements and Emoluments,
with those of the Establish'd way, of which they were
then full of Hopes, as well as diligent in their Endeavours
to compass. But if the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,, or he, who contrary
to <hi>his own Knowledge,</hi> shall teach or write what is of no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Tendency; but to make a Schism, Division, and mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>understanding
in Churches, and among Believers, ought to
be <hi>rejected,</hi> or mark'd out as a Person, neither fit for Civil
Familiarity, nor for Church Communion, much less for a
Station in the Ecclesiastical Office, we may thereupon ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily
conclude how the <hi>Presbyterian Ministers</hi> that assemble at
St. <hi>Hellens,</hi> ought to behave themselves towards Mr. <hi>Alsop,</hi>
and by what Marks of Censure they should distinguish him
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:62502:31"/>
from the rest of that Society, that he may be so known,
as at the least to be shunn'd and avoided, unless they will
partake of other Men's Sins, and come under the Guilt, as
well as be involv'd under the Ignominies of all the Petu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancies,
Scurrilities, Impurities, Misrepresentations, and
Slanders, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which he hath vented against Holy, Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and Faithful Ministers of the Gospel, without either
Ground or Provocation, save what the asserting receiv'd
Doctrines of Faith, with <hi>Pastoral Fidelity,</hi> and Christian
Zeal, yet at the same time, with the Modesty and good
Manners of Scholars and Gentlemen, hath given and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministred.</p>
            <p>Now tho' there remain many other very remarkable
Instances of his <hi>Insincerity,</hi> in misrepresenting his Adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
without any just Cause given by them, and contrary
to the practical <hi>Dictamen</hi> of his own Understanding, I shall
with reference to Matter of Theology, take notice of one
more: And that is about <hi>Christ's having in his Suffering
what the Sanction of the Law made the punishment due to Sin,
sustained the Person of those Sinners whom he intentionally died
to redeem and save,</hi> and in whose room and stead, pursuant
to the Covenant of Redemption, he substituted himself, to
undergo whatsoever was essentially imported in the threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
unto the Execution, whereof they were become ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious.
And tho' I have suggested this in a Line or two
already, yet it is of that Importance in it self, and gives
such a fair and ample Occasion of detecting the <hi>Medisance,</hi>
and scarcely to be paralell'd slandrous Faculty of Mr. <hi>Alsop,</hi>
that I do think it my Indispensible Duty, both to re-assume
and enlarge upon it. And as it was never pleaded by Mr.
<hi>Lobb,</hi> that the foremention'd Phrase was Litterally and
Syllabically <hi>Canonical;</hi> so it implies either the grossest <hi>Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance,</hi>
or the highest <hi>Impudence,</hi> to suppose it to have been
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:62502:31"/>
at first <hi>invented,</hi> or that it hath been peculialy used by the
<hi>Antinomians:</hi> Seeing it owes its Original and its Adoption
into these <hi>Controversies,</hi> to Writers of the best Character
for Learning and Piety, that the Reformed Churches could
ever boast of. And as the declared Opposition made by the
<hi>Socinians,</hi> to the <hi>Satisfaction</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> (unless taken in a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphorical
Sense) and the <hi>Fraudulency</hi> of some <hi>Arminians,</hi>
both in enervating the meaning of it; and in the pervert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and mis-expounding it to other ends, than those for which
it was requir'd of the <hi>Father,</hi> and undertaken and perform'd
by the <hi>Son,</hi> gave the first Rise to the <hi>Mintage</hi> and Currency
both of this and other <hi>Phrases,</hi> as those that are judg'd ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly
subservient to the Vindication of that Glorious
Truth, and very useful both to cover it from the Attacques of
Adversaries, and to convey the meaning, Relief and Comfort
of it, to the minds of Believers; so it is as demonstrable as any
<hi>Probleme</hi> in <hi>Euclide,</hi> that neither <hi>Mr. Lobb,</hi> nor any Person of
Eminency among the <hi>Congregational Ministers,</hi> have other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
paraphras'd, expounded, or applied it, than as its com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Signification, Importance, Service and Use, have been
stated aud derived unto them in the most celebrated <hi>Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,</hi>
both <hi>Dogmatical</hi> and <hi>Controversial,</hi> of the chief Divines
in the Reformed Churches. So that it may give matter of
Astonishment, with what <hi>Insincerity,</hi> or from what prodigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Ignorance <hi>Mr. Alsop</hi> doth to that degree of Prophaneness
and Drollery, declaim against, and endeavour to expose the
<hi>Phrase,</hi> as if wholly new, and indebted both for its <hi>Coynage,</hi>
and its Denization in these Controversies, to a few <hi>English</hi>
Writers of the <hi>Congregational</hi> Perswasion, that are but of
Yesterday, whereas it hath been Naturaliz'd, Legitimated,
and made Authentick, by the most famous Theologues that
ever appear'd in the <hi>Polemick</hi> Field, either against those of
the <hi>Cracovian</hi> Belief, or <hi>Arminius</hi> and his Disciples. But that
I may not be thought to misrepresent him, while I am in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diting
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:62502:32"/>
him of that Crime, in reference to others. I will
for the rendring his defamatory Insolence, in what he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes
to Mr. <hi>Lobb,</hi> and to others of the Congregational way,
evident beyond all reasonable Opposition and Controul. And
for the justifying my own Integrity in what I accuse him of,
lest he should compare me to the <hi>Chaplain of the Copper-Mines
in Sweden,</hi> as he hath done Mr. <hi>Lobb,</hi> p. 87. <hi>of his Vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
&amp;c. (whereas of all Men he has himself the best Right
to that Title and Character, and in which Office I know
none that are desirous to supplant him, or who pretend to
Rival him in Qualifications for the Imploy) I will, I say,
call over some Passages in his own Books; his Face, Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
and the Complexion of his Mind being drawn there
in the liveliest Colours, and set in the most advantageous
Light, for those to view him, who take Pleasure in mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strous
and deformed Sights: whereof the <hi>first</hi> shall be that,
p. 10. <hi>of his Faithful Rebuke to a false Report,</hi> where he tells
us, <hi>that as the Phrase is new and uncouth, so it seems to him
unintelligible.</hi> In reference whereunto, it were no Uncha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritableness
to suppose that he accounteth it to be so, upon the
like Motives which the <hi>Socinians</hi> and <hi>Arminians</hi> do, who
do not reckon it <hi>Vnintelligible,</hi> because of any <hi>Abstruseness</hi>
in the <hi>Phrase,</hi> but for the sake of the Truth which it Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phatically
expresseth. Nor is the calling it <hi>new,</hi> the worst
he thinks fit to say of it, and therefore he adds, <hi>p.</hi> 11. ibid.
<hi>That it is a Phrase to puzzle and confound Men's Vnderstanings;</hi>
and p. 13. <hi>an Arbitrary Term, only fit to beget Blunder and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion;</hi>
and p. 53. ubi supra, <hi>that to sustain the Person of Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
is an Anglicism, and that it will not endure to shew its
Face in some other of the Learned Languages; and to say Christ
did</hi> sustinere personam Alterius; <hi>is to say, That he wore the
Mask, the Vizor, the Disguise of Sinners, and that he was</hi> Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonatus
Histrio, <hi>like a Stage-Player, that puts on the Person of
a King, when indeed he is but some sorry Fellow:</hi> To which
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:62502:32"/>
Expressions concerning it in his <hi>Faithful Rebuke,</hi> (whereof
also I have remitted the Repetition of many) there are
divers in his <hi>Vindication of the like Stamp</hi> with them, as being
all Forged in the same Mint. As namely that, p. 54. <hi>It ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
had its Signification fixt and stated by a Competent Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity:
The Trumpet gives an uncertain Sound, and that if they
must subscribe, it must be with an Implicite Faith in its own
good meaning; and that he fears that the Notion of Christ's su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staining
our Person in his suffering for our Sins, which Mr.</hi> Lobb
<hi>and others do play withal, should in time become the Test of the
Faith of sound Protestants, and all shall be damned that cannot
subscribe the Antinomian Creed.</hi> Whereunto may be added
what we met with in <hi>p. 93. ubi supra,</hi> viz. <hi>That it is a Phrase
of a dark and dubious meaning, and as the Words seem to sound
of dangerous Design and Tendency;</hi> by which, nothing else can
honestly and truly be meant, but that it is of an evil and
fatal Consequence, in reference to the overthrowing the
Notions of the <hi>Socinians</hi> and <hi>Arminians,</hi> which out of Respect
to Mr. <hi>Williams,</hi> if not to <hi>Himself,</hi> he is very sorry for.
And of Affinity to the foremention'd Expressions, is that
which occurs <hi>p.</hi> 97. of the same Book, where he tells us,
<hi>that it is inept and improper to convey to our Vnderstanding the
Truth of Christ's having died for our Sins:</hi> whereas much wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser
and far more learned Men than he, <hi>i. e.</hi> All the great
<hi>Divines,</hi> who have written with Irrefragable Strength, and
with exact Accuracy on the Subject of <hi>Christ's Satisfaction,</hi>
have judg'd it the aptest and properest Phrase, which in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to that end, they could fall upon. And to all the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going
rude and unmannerly Misrepresentations of it, may
be subjoyned that Expression, <hi>p.</hi> 99. ubi supra, <hi>that it is a
Phrase which carrieth an odd sound, and syncretizeth with the
Nestorian Gibberish, there having been a Crew of lewd Hereticks,
who affirmed that Christ took on him the Person of Sinners, and
these from the first Author and Founder of their Sect were called</hi>
               <pb n="56" facs="tcp:62502:33"/>
Nestorians, <hi>who maintain'd that Christ was constituted of two
Persons; the one the Eternal</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>who did assume the other
an Humane Person that was assumed.</hi> Which meerly to have
cited, is enough to shew that the Man is Lunatick and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracted,
as well as childishly, foolish, and grosly ignorant.
For without a large measure of the <hi>latter,</hi> and being very
much affected with the <hi>former,</hi> he could never have written
in this Nonsensical and Phrentick manner. For to imagine
that Christ's <hi>sustaining in his Sufferings</hi> the <hi>Person</hi> of the <hi>Elect,</hi>
or of such as either hid or should afterward believe, is co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>incident
with, or of any Alliance to <hi>Nestorianism,</hi> shews that
after all his Pretensions to modern and antient Learning, he
knows not what <hi>Nestorianism</hi> is, or that he hath both forfeit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
his Understanding, and bid adieu to Conscience. Seeing
whatsoever the Opinion of <hi>Nestorius</hi> himself was, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
which I shall not now enquire, and much less reflect
upon <hi>Cyrill</hi> and others, who are thought by some to have
misunderstood or misrepresented him, it is certain that what
was condemned as <hi>Nestorianism</hi> in the <hi>General Council</hi> of <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus,
Anno</hi> 428. was, that the <hi>second Person</hi> of the <hi>Trinity,</hi> the
<hi>Eternal</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> took an <hi>entire Humane Person,</hi> and not meerly
the <hi>Humane Nature</hi> into Union with his <hi>Divine Person;</hi> and
that he was constituted not of two <hi>Natures,</hi> whereof the
<hi>Humane</hi> being taken into Union with the <hi>second Person</hi> of the
<hi>Trinity,</hi> without any <hi>Personal Subsistence</hi> of its own Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct,
from that of the Eternal <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, subsisted by <hi>Perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nality</hi>
of the <hi>Son of God;</hi> but that he was constituted of two
Essential distinct <hi>natural Persons.</hi> Now how Christ's stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the room and stead, and <hi>sustaining the Person</hi> of the
<hi>Elect</hi> in his suffering for them as their <hi>Surety,</hi> should come
to be compared with, or paralell'd unto <hi>Nestorianism;</hi> and
thereupon expos'd to Ridicule, and rejected as Heretical, I
think no Man, who is not depriv'd of Reason and common
Sense, will presume to understand. Nor would any, save
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:62502:33"/>
one beyond the Relief of <hi>Hellebore,</hi> have had the madness
to have fancied or said it. For as the Orthodox by believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and declaring that the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> took a <hi>singular</hi> and <hi>individual
Humane Nature</hi> of the same Species with ours, <hi>i. e.</hi> A true
Body and a reasonable Soul into Union with his <hi>Divine Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son;</hi>
never meant that he took an <hi>Humane Person</hi> into that
Union; but that the Nature which he assumed, subsisted by
the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> of the Son of God; so the very <hi>Nestorians,</hi> who
held that the <hi>second Person</hi> of the <hi>Trinity</hi> took an <hi>Individual
Humane Person,</hi> i. e. an <hi>Humane Nature,</hi> with its proper, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
and peculiar <hi>Subsistence</hi> into Union with his Divine Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
were never so nonsensical and delirious, as to dream, and
much less to say that he took the <hi>Persons</hi> of all the Elect into a
natural, Physical, or Hypostatical Union with himself, as
he was the Eternal Son of God.</p>
            <p>To which may be added, as that which is further detective
of Mr. <hi>Alsop</hi>'s prodigious Ignorance, or his impresidented <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sincerity,</hi>
that the <hi>Phrase</hi> of <hi>Christ's sustaining</hi> the <hi>Person</hi> of
the Elect upon the Reasons, and for the Purposes already
mention'd, was never intended to denote a <hi>Personal</hi> Union,
whether <hi>Physical</hi> or <hi>Hypostatical</hi> between Him and Them;
but meerly a Moral and Legal. Nor was it ever used to sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie
and express more than what he did for them in a <hi>Juri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dical</hi>
Construction; namely, that thro' being their Surety,
he represented and became <hi>one</hi> with them in <hi>Conspectu Fori;</hi>
and that thro' standing in their room and stead, he had the
Guilt of their Sins imputed to Him, and suffer'd both in
their place, and underwent whatsoever was <hi>Primarily</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended,
and <hi>Essentially</hi> comprehended in the Sanction of the
Law; to which, they, thro' a Violation of the Preceptive
part of it, were become Obnoxious. That is, to use the
Language and Stile of Foreign Divines, least I should be
thought to utter <hi>Anglicisms,</hi> or to vent what slanderous Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
may call <hi>Crispianism. Christum ut sponsorem foederis, pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cata

<hi>Pro quibus Christus satisfecit, eorum personam susti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuit,

<pb n="59" facs="tcp:62502:34"/>
               <hi>That all for whom Christ satisfied he sustained their Person; but
that the Person of the Reprobate, and of those that were to perish,
and to be Eternally damned, he did not sustain, Ergo.</hi> So that
thro' what I have cited out of these three Eminent Divines,
who were no ways inclined to <hi>Antinomianism,</hi> and who were
certainly of as vast Lection, and as great Theological Lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terature,
as any this Age hath produced, and its being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd
with what hath been also quoted out of Mr. <hi>Alsop,</hi> it
may be very justly question'd whether his Ignorance,
his Insincerity, or his Prophaneness, be most to be blamed,
all three being both so signal and so obvious. And it
were well, if the chief thing he were impeachable for, were
his Ignorance, tho' that in a matter of this Nature, would
not only lessen his Reputation as a Scholar, and degrade him
from being a competent Writer of Theological Books, but
unqualifie him to be a Minister of the Gospel, and from ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the Inspection and Instruction of a Church. But it was
not so much thro' Ignorance, as thro' Insincerity, that
he hath belched forth those many rude and unmannerly, as
well as false and slanderous Expressions and Things, which
I have now call'd over. For as if he took it for a Diminution
of his Worth, and an affront to his Dignity, that any
save Himself should have the Priviledge of exposing Him,
and of shewing with what Knavery he writes (pardon the
term, by reason the Penury of our Language is such, that it
affords not a milder nor a genteeler upon the Occasion and
Provocation) for he doth not only in several Places acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
that the Phrase is capable of a good Sense; but that it
had been used by Divines of the highest Character in the
Reformed Churches. Only that his Sophistry and Prevari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
may be no less apparent when he is forced to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
a Truth, than when he Invents a Fable, and Coins a Lye,
he assumes the Confidence to say, <hi>That its being used was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the</hi> Antinomian <hi>Heresies were broached, and that from
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:62502:35"/>
thence some of our Protestant Divines might overlash a little in
some Phrases, as not dreaming of</hi> Saltmarsh <hi>or</hi> Crisp; <hi>and that
it was in their Polemicks they talk'd thus, and not in Articles
of Faith; and that they talk at this rate when they were fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and not uniting; and that none of them give any Reason
for their using the Phrase, but run away with it as a word of
course; and that Mr.</hi> Lobb'<hi>s Lumber of Modern Testimonies, as
if the Cause were to be pressed to Death with Number, and not
with Weight, doth only prove those Learned Divines to have been
of this Faith; that Christ died in our stead, but that Christ in
his Death sustained the Person of Sinners</hi> (for so he should have
worded it, would he have been sincere and ingenious) <hi>was
necessary to the Explication or Confirmation of that Truth they
prove not,</hi> p. 104, 105. and 96 of his Vindic. and with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
to all which Exceptions, I do boldly, because knowing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
affirm, that he doth not only shamefully mistake in all,
and in every one of the foremention'd Matters of <hi>Fact,</hi> but
that contrary to the Light of his Mind, and the Conviction
of his Conscience, he falsifieth and prevaricates in them out
of Choice and Design. Seeing if ever he had a quarter of
that Learning which Himself pretendeth to, and which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
have allow'd him, it is impossible but he should know,
that as the Broaching the <hi>Antinomian Heresies</hi> was of a far
older date, than the using of that Phrase was by most, or
any of those Divines, whom Mr. <hi>Lobb</hi> hath quoted, and much
more, long before <hi>Saltmarsh</hi> and Dr. <hi>Crisp</hi> were heard of; so he
cannot without great and reproachable Unacquaintance with
Theological and Ecclesiastical Writers, be ignorant that it
hath been used by divers learned Persons, who have actually,
and upon Design, employ'd their Pens against <hi>Antinomianism:</hi>
And that tho it is not <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> in Creeds and Confessions
(whereof I have assigned the Reason before) yet it hath been
employed both in <hi>Dogmatical</hi> and <hi>Controversial</hi> Writings a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the <hi>Socinians</hi> and others, towards the <hi>Defence</hi> and <hi>Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication</hi>
               <pb n="53" facs="tcp:62502:35"/>
of the most momentous <hi>Articles of the Christian Faith:</hi>
And that upon no lesser Motives, than that the wisest and
best Propugnators of the <hi>Orthodox Doctrine,</hi> thought them
hardly either vindicable or explicate without it. And for
justifying the Truth of every particular which I have now
alledg'd, I do pledge and lay my Word to pawn, that I
shall be ready to demonstrate all the foregoing Heads,
whensoever Mr. <hi>Alsop</hi> shall judge it his Interest to call for
it. But which I think may be very well adjourn'd at this
time, both as being alien from my present Undertaking,
and because it would oblige me to enlarge this Letter far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than is comely and convenient in it self, or is any ways
necessary in a Matter wherein none that are, or have been
conversant in Theological Studies, can want or need Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.
I will not add further with what <hi>Insincerity,</hi> but
with what <hi>Forehead</hi> could Mr. <hi>Alsop,</hi> with all the petulant
and foolish Drollery, first expose and ridicule a Phrase,
which not only the greatest Men in the Reformed Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
have used with so much Seriousness, and upon the most
Important Service, and for the weightiest Reasons, but for the
Lampooning whereof, he himself is forc'd at last to make
an Excuse and Apology, by retreating to those weak and
fabulous Pretences, which I have repeated out of his
Book. Surely, either his Pride or his Malice have so Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctur'd
both his Mind and his Conscience, that he can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
write with Truth, Integrity, nor Discretion. For
were he not either abandon'd to a Reprobate Mind <hi>(i.e.</hi> an
empty, unprofitable, prostituted, and an embased Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing)
or perfectly delirous, he would not instead of
furnishing us with reasonable, just, and coherent Thoughts,
obtrude upon us what is either Scandalous and Impure, or
Chymerical, Fabulous and Romantick. But that which is more
to be detested, than even his <hi>Insincerity,</hi> is that he not only
turns every thing, how Sacred soever, into <hi>Droll</hi> and <hi>Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;</hi>
               <pb n="54" facs="tcp:62502:36"/>
but that with a Prophaneness, not to be exceeded, and
hardly to be paralell'd among the most Atheistical <hi>Debau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chees,</hi>
or the highest <hi>Ranters,</hi> he Ridicules and Lampoons
one of the most material Doctrines of Faith. For to say,
<hi>That our Lord Jesus Christ thro' sustaining the Person of the
Elect in his Sufferings,</hi> which is but the Equivalent (tho' a
little more Emphatically expressed for the Vindication of
the Truth and Reality of his Satisfaction against the <hi>Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,</hi>
who deny it, and the <hi>Arminians,</hi> who both supplant
and pervert it) <hi>of his dying in our room,</hi> was <hi>Histrio personatus.
Like a Stage-player, that puts on the Person of a King, when
indeed he is but some sorry Fellow;</hi> is a Blasphemy beyond
the Chastisement of the <hi>Pen,</hi> and ought to be punish'd by
the Publick <hi>Rods.</hi> And for the Brethren at St. <hi>Hellens,</hi> to
connive at this Impious <hi>Jeer</hi> and <hi>Sarcasm,</hi> will be construed
by the Sober and Impartial part of Mankind as an Approv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of it. Yea, if they suffer it to escape their Pastoral
Censure, it will be fit to bring it under the Animadversion
and Discipline of the Law. For Blasphemy is no less ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd
and communicated in an <hi>Allusion,</hi> than if it were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press'd
in plain and direct Terms. And to be patient and
modest in such a Case, is neither Religion nor good Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
but Treachery to our Lord Jesus Christ, and to the
Souls of Men. Could he not be contented to be a Dissem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bler,
an <hi>Histrio,</hi> a Stage-Player, a <hi>Perkin Warbeck</hi> himself,
in all the Characters he bears, and the Imployments which
he lays claim unto; but must he in a way of Licentious and
Impious Wit, transform our Blessed Lord in the Solemn
Work of Redemption into such an one? It will be highly
Righteous, and is therefore greatly to be feared, that he
who turns, <hi>Christ's sustaining the Person</hi> of those whom he
died to save, into a <hi>Jest,</hi> will be left in <hi>Earnest</hi> to bear both
the <hi>Guilt</hi> and <hi>Punishment</hi> of his own Crimes. For our Lord
Jesus Christ, being (even as our Mediator and Surety) pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:62502:36"/>
as the <hi>Object</hi> of our <hi>Adoration;</hi> he cannot without the
highest Blasphemy, be made the <hi>Subj<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ct</hi> of our <hi>wanton Sport.</hi>
And his having done and suffer'd all that was Incumbent

Thankfulness; and not to be thus Atheistically Ridcul'd
and Lampoon'd.</p>
            <p>But that I may not pursue the Accusation of <hi>Insincerity,</hi>
wherewith I have charged him, to that Extent and Prolixity
that I might, and for which he hath afforded me plentiful
Matter, whereupon to found several other Examples and
Instances of it, I will therefore, both to save him the being
further expos'd, and made infamous, and to spare my self
the unsafe, as well as unpleasant Labour of <hi>Dissecting</hi> a Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt,
if not an Infectious <hi>Body,</hi> give only one Example
more of it; and that in another kind of Learning<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
his weak and ignorant Admirers will have him to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirably
qualified. For whereas he has the Vanity himself
to set up, not only for an excellent <hi>Grammarian,</hi> but for an
exact and wonderful <hi>Philologist,</hi> and is highly worshipp'd,
and hath a great Veneration paid him upon that Account by
Mr. <hi>Williams,</hi> who can neither speak nor write <hi>Syntaxical
Latin,</hi> if he can so much as understand a common <hi>Roman</hi>
Author, not to put him upon the difficulty of Relishing <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cero,</hi>
I shall therefore shew him to be either a Dunce in that
kind of Learning, or that his Conscience and Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
are not at an <hi>Accord.</hi> In that he either ignorantly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts
a common <hi>Latin Passage</hi> from the true Sense of it, or
with his Customary <hi>Insincerity,</hi> doth contrary to his Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
mis-represent its meaning. The Passage which I do
refer unto is that of <hi>Milton</hi>'s upbraiding <hi>Salmasius</hi> for his say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<hi>De parricidio in persona Regis admisso;</hi> and <hi>Milton</hi>'s ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
thereupon, <hi>Quid quaeso est parricidium in persona Regis
admittere? Quid in persona Regis? Quae unquam Latinitas sic
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:62502:37"/>
locuta est? Nisi aliquem nobis Pstudo-Philippum narras,</hi> &amp;c.
From which Expression Mr. <hi>Alsop</hi> took occasion for the
raising and supporting all the Impious Banter, and Athei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical
Drollery, for which I have lately called him to an
Account; whereas it's most probable that Mr. <hi>Milton</hi>
quarrell'd not with <hi>Salmasius</hi> about the Word <hi>Persona,</hi> with
Respect to its having a Natural and Proper, as well as a
Tropical Signification; but that his Satyrical Reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
against that great <hi>Philologist</hi> and <hi>Critick,</hi> was rather
for his having used the <hi>Ablative Case, Persona,</hi>
in the Room of the <hi>Accusative, Personam,</hi> which
<hi>Milton</hi> seems to have fancied he ought to have used.
For, though he could not but know that a <hi>Persona</hi> in the
<hi>Nominative,</hi> might and usually did admit a Natural Signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,
yet it's most likely he imagin'd that it neither did
nor could do so<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as it is there used by <hi>Salmasius</hi> in the <hi>Abla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive.</hi>
And from thence it was that he Construed, <hi>Persona,</hi>
in the <hi>Ablative,</hi> not to signifie a <hi>Rightful</hi> and <hi>Legal King,</hi>
but a <hi>Tyrant,</hi> there upon adding <hi>Tyrannus enim qnasi Histri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onalis
quidam Rex, Lurva tantum &amp; Persona Regis, non
versus Rex est.</hi> Now whereas Mr. <hi>Lobb</hi> had given this
Answer to Mr. <hi>Alsop</hi> upon his having on this supposed
Authority of <hi>Miltons</hi> so prophanely <hi>Banter'd</hi> upon the
Word <hi>Persona,</hi> as used in Reference to Christ'<hi>s</hi> Represent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and Standing in the Room of the <hi>Elect</hi> in His Sufferings:
The Reply which this Wanton <hi>Buffoon</hi> and Ignorant <hi>Fop</hi>
makes is, <hi>Risum teneatis, was any thing spoken more Ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culously;
in that Mr.</hi> Milton <hi>had no quarrel with</hi> Salmasius
<hi>about the Case, but Exagitates the Phrase as improper and
unbecoming so great a</hi> Grammarian <hi>as</hi> Salmasius <hi>had then
the Vogue for in the Learned World.</hi> Vindicat. &amp;c. p. 111,
112. Whereas notwithstanding both the positiveness and
the huffing of this Haughty Man, the Answer that
was given to Mr. <hi>Alsop</hi> by Mr. <hi>Lobb</hi> is the very same with
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:62502:37"/>
one of the Answers which <hi>Salmasius</hi> gives in his <hi>Reply</hi> (Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished
by his Son) to Mr. <hi>Milton.</hi> For having proved by
many Instances that <hi>Persona</hi> is often taken by and used in
the Best Authors, in a <hi>Proper</hi> and <hi>Natural</hi> Sense, and
not always in a <hi>Figurative</hi> and <hi>Tropical,</hi> as <hi>Splendida Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sona
in Celsus, for one in Eminent Dignity, Persona Imperato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris
in Aemylius probus, to signifie the Emperour; non qualis
cunque Persona Testimonii pondus habet, that every Mans
Disposition is not of Credit, in</hi> Cicero; <hi>parcere Personis,
dicere de vitiis, to spare Mens Persons when we speak of their
Faults,</hi> according to the common <hi>Gnomon; Mea &amp; Tua
Persona pro Ego &amp; Tu, My Person and Yours, for I and You;
Persona pupilli &amp; Tutoris, among the</hi> Civilians, <hi>for the Guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian
and the Pupil; Personales Actiones</hi> in the Law, <hi>Actions
which affect the Persons of Men in Contradistinction from
Rules which affect only their Goods and Estates,</hi> &amp;c. I do
say, that after <hi>Salmasius</hi> had alledged all that I have now
mention'd, in Justification of his having used the Word
<hi>Persona,</hi> in a Proper Sense (whereunto it were Easy to
Multiply Hundreds of Testimonies more Omitted by him,
were it not both Pedantick and needless) he adds, that
<hi>Milton</hi>'s Accusing him of <hi>Barbarism,</hi> because of the Foremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
Expression, was, <hi>Fortassean quod non dixerit</hi> Salma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius
<hi>in Personam Regis admissum parricidium, sed in Perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,
perhaps because he had used the Term in the Ablative and
not in the Accusative.</hi> Upon which that Great <hi>Philologist</hi>
proceeds to Expose as well as also Reprimand him, in say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<hi>O Barde, Ludimagistrum veterem redi, ut discas quid
sit Latine Loqui, Get thee Fool back to thy School-Master,</hi>
and under the Ferula, <hi>that thou maist Learn what it is to
speak Latin.</hi> And to Expose <hi>Milton</hi>'s Ignorance, he sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyns
divers Testimonies out of Classick Authors, in which
the <hi>Ablative</hi> is used in the Sense that he had Imployed it.
As, <hi>in Persona errare pro circa Personam; in puella pallere:</hi>
               <pb n="68" facs="tcp:62502:38"/>
And that of <hi>Virgil</hi> speaking of <hi>Achilles, non talis in hoste
fuit Priamo.</hi> So that the <hi>O Barde, thou Fool,</hi> whereof
Mr. <hi>Alsop</hi> is so liberal to Mr <hi>Lobb, p. 112. ubi supra,</hi> falls to his
own share, and comes in with his many other good Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
to make a part of his Character. Nor ought I to omit
here further to Observe, because it shews the Ignorance or
the Insincerity of the Man beyond all possibility of Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction,
how he either Misunderstands or Perverts the design
of <hi>Salmasius</hi>'s saying to <hi>Milton, O Barde!</hi> Through affirming
that the whole which <hi>Salmasius</hi> intended, was <hi>to reject the
supposal with Scorn and Indignation, that he should be thought
to have mistaken the Ablative for the Accusative. Ibid.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
it was no part of his Intention to Excuse himself
from a Mistake of that Nature, in that he very well knew
that he had Written, as according to Patterns set him in
the best <hi>Roman</hi> Authors, tho he both might and ought, but
the whole of his Intention was to Ridicule Mr. <hi>Milton</hi> for
quarrelling with it as a <hi>Barbarism,</hi> when indeed it was rather
an <hi>Elegancy.</hi> However upon the whole Mr. <hi>Alsop</hi> appears
no less Ignorant and Ridiculous, in his affirming the Word
<hi>Person</hi> to signifie only a <hi>Larva,</hi> one under a Mask or Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guise,
like the <hi>Personae Dramatis,</hi> the <hi>Comedians</hi> upon a
Stage, who Counterfeit Persons whom they neither really,
nor Juridically, or Legally are; and that <hi>Persona, &amp; Perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam
Sustinere, dare not shew their Face in any Learned Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,</hi>
in another Sense; than <hi>Salmasius</hi> pronounceth Mr. <hi>Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>
to have taken it, in his Requiring an <hi>Accusative</hi> when an
<hi>Ablative</hi> was as <hi>Rhetorical,</hi> but the Impiety of Mr. <hi>Alsop</hi> is
glaring and unpardonable, to have upon no other Occasion,
than a <hi>Grammatical Scuffle</hi> between two Learned Men, who
Extreamly valued themselves upon their understanding the
Proprieties and Elegancies of the <hi>Latine</hi> Tongue, and who
sought all Advantages, for Depressing, and lessening one
anothers Esteem, with respect to their knowledge in that
Language. I say, to have upon no other Occasion run into
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:62502:38"/>
those Excesses of Ribaldry, Lampoon and Blasphemy, which
he hath done in his Assimilating Christ's sustaining the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of the Elect in his Sufferings, to an <hi>Actor</hi> on a
<hi>Theatre,</hi> who assumes the personating of another upon Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
of Profit, and for no other end (besides his own In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest)
than to give Sport and Diversion. And as for the
Character he gives Mr. <hi>Milton</hi> of having been a Person,
whose <hi>excellent Latin, Terse and Smooth, has recommended
his Stile to all that understand the Language;</hi> it is that which
I am not much concern'd, nor at leisure now largely to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
with him: But with respect to what his Religion was,
I have convincing Reasons to induce me to believe he was
an <hi>Arrian.</hi> And as his Principles of Faith (on that <hi>Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thesis,</hi>
which I shall be ready to justifie when lawfully call'd
to it) oblig'd him both to deny the <hi>Deity,</hi> and the <hi>Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction</hi>
of Christ; so it is the less to be wonder'd at, that he
took all Opportunities to expose and ridicule (considering
withal the Satyrical Genius and Temper of the Man) what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
he found made use of to explain and vindicate the
Doctrine of the <hi>Orthodox</hi> in either of those <hi>Articles.</hi> But
that Mr. <hi>Alsop</hi> should borrow and take up his <hi>Sarcasms</hi> upon
the Fundamentals of our <hi>Christian Faith,</hi> and improve them
into Ribaldry, Blasphemy, and Burlesque, (which as those
times would not bear in any, so Mr. <hi>Milton</hi> had more Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion
than to attempt it) would be somewhat surprizing,
were not the Man distracted; and whosoever is so, may
even renounce Christ and the Gospel, as well as slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
and revile his Brethren, without the being held or pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish'd
as a Criminal. Seeing such as are <hi>Lunatick</hi> are alike
uncapable of <hi>Moral,</hi> as of <hi>Civil Government,</hi> and not to be
restrain'd by <hi>Laws,</hi> but by Fetters and Chains. Tho' it is
nevertheless observed of mad Men, that they are much the
same in their <hi>Paroxisms</hi> of <hi>Phrensie,</hi> what they were in the
<hi>Moral</hi> and <hi>Political Complexions</hi> of their Minds before, (wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:62502:39"/>
among a thousand others, <hi>Oliver's Porter)</hi> tho' they had
the Art and Hypocrisie to cover and conceal it. But as to
Mr. <hi>Milton</hi>'s having been a compleat Master in the <hi>Latin</hi>
Tongue, I will not (as I just now said) be so injurious to the
Reputation of his Memory, as to endeavour with any In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry
or Zeal to detract from his Character in that parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular.
Tho' it were not difficult to cite several Passages
out of his <hi>Defensio pro populo Anglicano,</hi> (which is the Book
upon a Paragraph, whereof Mr. <hi>Alsop</hi> superstructs his Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>istical
Prophanations, in reference to our Saviour, and his
Redemption of Sinners) that are so far from being <hi>Elegant,</hi>
that they are not <hi>true</hi> nor <hi>proper Latin.</hi> Such are his <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do
Aures teretes habent &amp; doctas, Provided they have accurate
and learned Ears.</hi> For <hi>modo habeant. Fastigio turgere, to be
swell'd with, and elevated thro Pride, pro Fastu. Ne ex la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chrimis

be extracted out of Tears:</hi> For <hi>guttam</hi> or <hi>guttulam,</hi> a Drop.
<hi>Exiguissimam the least,</hi> which is no Latin word, for <hi>Exiguam.
Stipe Contentum esse,</hi> to be satisfied with an <hi>Alms;</hi> for <hi>Stipen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dio,</hi>
a <hi>Sallary</hi> or <hi>Reward;</hi> and <hi>Denarium illud,</hi> which is a
gross <hi>Solloecism;</hi> for <hi>Illum, that Penny.</hi> Besides many more,
which I have not Time, nor will be so uncivil as to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of. Neither will I say that these Mistakes, whither <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barisms</hi>
or <hi>Soloecisms,</hi> do in the least hinder Mr. <hi>Milton</hi> from
being very justly esteem'd an excellent Latinist, seeing the
<hi>Politest</hi> Writers in that <hi>Language</hi> are sometimes subject to
<hi>Faults</hi> of the like kind. So that even <hi>Strada,</hi> who was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly
one of the most <hi>Elegant</hi> Writers in the <hi>Latin</hi>
Tongue, which any of the latter Ages have produced, could
not escape being severely exposed, as well as Animadverted
upon by <hi>Sciopius,</hi> in a Book which that ill-natur'd and snar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
Critick intituled, <hi>Infamia famiani stradae.</hi> And if it should
in the Event prove, that it was not for Mr. <hi>Miltons</hi> having
been an <hi>Arrian</hi> (tho' that People's Theological System is
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:62502:39"/>
in all things more Coherent in it self, and in some not so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractive
from our Lord Jesus Christ, nor so contradictious to
the Scripture in divers Particulars, as that of the <hi>Socinians</hi> is)
why Mr. <hi>Alsop</hi> doth so esteem and admire him, and gather
up the most Ulcerous and Infective part of his Writings,
with greater Lusciousness than the <hi>Poets</hi> are said to have
lick'd <hi>Homer's Spittle;</hi> yet if Mr. <hi>Milton</hi> had two other
Qualities, that reconcile him to Mr. <hi>Alsop</hi>'s Veneration, and
which encourage him both to borrow from, and imitate
him. One was, his having been the most Satyrical and Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>castical
Writer of this Age; who never cared whether what
he said of an Adversary was either true or civil, provided
it was but picquant and biting: And who never govern'd
himself towards those that had wrote against him, by the
Maxims and Rules either of <hi>Religion,</hi> or of <hi>Moral Decency,</hi>
but by Principles of Haughtiness, Indignation, and Revenge,
whereof both his <hi>Defensio pro populo Anglicano,</hi> against <hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>masius,</hi>
and his <hi>Defensio pro seipso,</hi> against <hi>Morus,</hi> (not to
mention other of his Books) are as well shameful as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>controulable
Evidences. The other was his having been the
most malicious and virulent <hi>Antimonarchical</hi> Writer in <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,</hi>
and the greater Zealot for <hi>Democracy.</hi> For which, I
suppose he has the more Incense offer'd to his Memory by
<hi>Mr. Alsop,</hi> and the sweeter Flowers strowed upon his Grave.
Which I doubt not but <hi>Mr. Alsop,</hi> with the same Faecility,
and the like Artifices of Sophistry can reconcile, both to his
having taken the Oath of Allegiance to his present <hi>Majesty,</hi>
as Rightful Soveraign and King, and to his having subscrib'd
the Association, as he can bring his <hi>Antisozzo</hi> to harmonize,
and to be in Alliance and Confederacy with his <hi>Faithful Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke,</hi>
and his <hi>Vindication</hi> of it. All that I will further add
in reference to <hi>Mr. Alsop</hi>'s transferring a Passage out of <hi>Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>
(and that both wonderfully mistaken, misapplied, and
blasphemously improv'd by him, and in which <hi>Mr. Milton</hi>
               <pb n="72" facs="tcp:62502:40"/>
also grosly erred) upon a <hi>Subject,</hi> where, tho Raillery was
not decent, yet it was not Impious, into a Theological Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
about an Important Article of Faith, and his perver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
it there to the height of Prophaneness, is, that the man
will be beholding to any Authors whatsoever, and readily
borrow from them; yea, be thankful to the <hi>Chaplain of the
Copper-mines in Sweden,</hi> for his Aid and Assistance, (with
whom, having brought him into an <hi>Ecclesiastical Office,</hi> I
do reckon he purposeth to cultivate a Friendship and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respondence)
in order to his being enabled to be Irreligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
<hi>Witty.</hi> Nor are his many Puns, Quibbles, Jests,
Drolleries and Sarcasms, wherewith his late Books are
plentifully enrich'd, any thing else, save the most Immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
and Libertine Scraps of the worst <hi>Plays,</hi> and the greatliest
offensive <hi>Recrements of the Mountebank's Stage,</hi> which he hath
borrow'd and transplanted thence, and grafted into his <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logical
Writings,</hi> and his Divinity Lectures to make himself e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem'd
a Jocular, Divertive, and Witty Author, whereas in
reality they do only serve to proclaim him a pittiful <hi>Jack-Pudding,</hi>
and an <hi>Insolent Buffoon,</hi> who hath neither Grace
nor good manners.</p>
            <p>Having dispatch'd all that I intended upon the Head of
<hi>Mr. Alsop</hi>'s <hi>Insincerity,</hi> in what he writes, both of Persons
and Things; and having interwoven some Reflections upon
that way, manner, and method of Writing, as I found them
agreeable and pertinent to the several and respectful <hi>Instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi>
I have alledged in Justification of that Charge, all that
now remains in reference to this Branch of my Letter, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dressed
unto you, <hi>Reverend Pastors, and Brethren of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregational
Perswasion,</hi> is by a very few general Reflections,
(which <hi>I</hi> promised as <hi>Muzzel</hi> to this <hi>Molossus)</hi> to lay open
the Hurt and Mischief, as well as the moral Criminalness
of it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="73" facs="tcp:62502:40"/>
In the <hi>First</hi> Place then, It is a high Affront to the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
God, who being Himself Essentially <hi>Veracious,</hi> Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed
it Originally as a <hi>Dictamen Natural</hi> upon our Inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectual
Faculties, that we should not dissemble, Misrepre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
falsly nor directly Lye. For as it is Contradictious
to all the Attributes of God, that he should depart from
<hi>Truth,</hi> and <hi>Veracity,</hi> in what he says either in Revealing
Doctrines to be Implicitly believed, giving forth Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
to be firmly Relied upon; Denouncing Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings,
to be greatly Dreaded; or Recording Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of Fact, to be carefully Observed; So it is both
our Indispensable Duty to Conform unto and Imitate
Him, and will be the highest Improvement and Perfection
of our Reasonable Nature, to become as nearly <hi>Assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulated</hi>
unto him in the <hi>Properties</hi> of <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Sinceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi>
as our Creature and Finite State will admit. For, tho
there be several things, the Injunction whereof depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
Entirely upon the Soveraign, and Arbitrarious Will of
God; and Abstracting from which, the Performance of
them, would be no part of Duty, nor the Omitting of
them any Trasgression; yet his requiring us to be <hi>Veracious</hi>
and <hi>Sincere</hi> in whatsoever we Profess in reference to Him,
and what he has Authentically Declared; or speak unto,
or concerning Men; hath its Foundation in the Atributes
of the Divine Being, Anticedently unto, and Regulative
of the <hi>Placita</hi> of His Will. And as every Man therefore
upon the Principles of his being made in the <hi>Image of God,</hi>
and under His Law, ought to be exactly <hi>Veracious,</hi> and
not to Represent Persons and Things otherwise than he
knows them to be; so there are Particular Reasons, for
which the departure of a Minister of the Gospel from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Morally upright, <hi>Sincere</hi> and <hi>True,</hi> comes to be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
with an Aggravated and Inhansed Guilt. Because
being a Selected, and Peculiar Officer both of Gods <hi>Rectoral
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:62502:41"/>
Kingdom</hi> over men in General, and of His <hi>Dispensations of
Grace,</hi> for the recovering a lapsed Race to their Duty, and
the Re-envesting them in a Forfeited Happiness; he is upon
both Accounts Distinctly Bound, not to do or say any thing,
that may be Inconsistent with, or unbecoming the Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter
of an <hi>Ambassadour</hi> of the Great and True God, the High
and Universal Soveraign, and our Gracious and Merciful
Father. For whereas Tricks, Deceits, Misrepresentations, and
Imposings upon the Easy and Credulous part of Mankind,
are Observed to have been very usual and Customary Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
in the <hi>Priests</hi> of the <hi>Heathen Deities,</hi> yet it is a thing that
can be plainly Accounted for, in that being the Officers and
Ministers of the Father of <hi>Lies,</hi> and who through speaking
under his Authority, and in Imitation of his Example, did
but in Conformity both to their Masters Copy and his
Commission. As he in <hi>Terence</hi> Justified his Laciviousness
from his Acting after the Patern set him by <hi>Jupiter.</hi> But
that One who Pretends to be Authorised to Declare the
<hi>Rectoral Will</hi> of the Supream and Soveraign <hi>Being;</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim
the <hi>Indemnifying Grace</hi> of a Compassionate and Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
Father, and Convey to the Knowledge of Men the
<hi>Truths</hi> Revealed by Him, that is the Essential <hi>Verity,</hi> should
not only allow himself in putting False <hi>Glosses</hi> upon Things,
through <hi>Paraphrasing</hi> what is <hi>Heterodox</hi> and <hi>Vnsound,</hi> to
an <hi>Orthodox</hi> and <hi>Honest</hi> Sense, which he knoweth in his
Conscience it will not bear; and by perversely <hi>Expounding</hi>
what is <hi>Erroneous</hi> to a good Meaning, which the Authors
neither Intended, nor the Words will Admit; but should
set up for a <hi>Romancer,</hi> a Coyner of <hi>Fables,</hi> a Misrepre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senter
and Slanderer, would be wonderfully surprising to
me in Reference to Mr. <hi>Alsop,</hi> had he not beforehand vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safed
to give me some Intelligence of his Acquaintance
with the <hi>Chaplain of the Copper-Mines in</hi> Sweden. Now
tho I have a large Field for suspicion before me, upon
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:62502:41"/>
which to judge what this Man is like to be in the <hi>Pulpit,</hi> from
what I find him to be from the <hi>Press;</hi> yet upon Recollecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of what I have observ'd him to say of others, namely,
That they are not the same when <hi>Disputing,</hi> as when <hi>Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>
and <hi>Preaching;</hi> I shall be ready to grant, that the Belief,
Doctrine, and Character of the Man, are not to be taken
from, and upon his <hi>Ravings</hi> in his <hi>Fits of Lunacy</hi> and <hi>Distra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction;</hi>
but that they are to be judg'd of by his <hi>Anti-Sozzo,</hi>
which he wrote either before he became <hi>Delirous,</hi> or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the <hi>Decay of the Moon,</hi> and in his <hi>Lucida.</hi> Only it will
be necessary for his <hi>Auditors,</hi> carefully to remark how the
Tide flows at <hi>London-Bridge</hi> and <hi>Westminster-stairs,</hi> that
they may thereby calculate at what Seasons they may
give Credit to the Doctrine of their <hi>Pastor.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>second Reflection</hi> I would make upon this Insincere
and misrepresenting way of writing is, that it undermines
and blows up the Foundation and <hi>Basis</hi> of all Society, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Civil</hi> or <hi>Ecclesiastick. Hobb</hi>'s <hi>State of Nature,</hi> in which
he supposed all Men to be from under the Ties and Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of Laws; so that he who had most <hi>Legerdemain</hi>
and <hi>Cunning,</hi> might over-reach, cheat and deceive; and
he who had the most Strength, or the greatest Party to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
him, might either rob or destroy his Neighbour, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
becoming Guilty or Obnoxious to Punishment, was an
Eligible Condition; in comparison of this, which Mr. <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sop</hi>'s
way of writing concerning Persons and Things, would
reduce the World unto. Seeing upon Mr. <hi>Hobb</hi>'s <hi>Hypothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis</hi>
all People would be upon their Guard, and no one would
give Faith or Credit to another, whether in Words or Oaths;
whereas all Society among Men being now establish'd upon
a Belief, that they might mutually trust and take one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's
Word, the Ligature and Cement of all Fellowship is
dissolv'd and broken into <hi>Atoms of Dust</hi> by the Morals and
Practice of Mr. <hi>Alsop.</hi> And if Mr. <hi>Hobb</hi>'s Scheme of Nature
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:62502:42"/>
be justly <hi>Detestable,</hi> because both of the Infamous Aspersi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
which it fastneth both upon the Wisdom and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of God, in making us not only capable of Conversati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and of Incorporating into Communities together; but
leaving us under those Individual Deficiencies and Necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
which render it absolutely necessary, without imbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
us with those Qualities, or the subjecting us to such
Laws, as make it practicable and safe; as also the Affront it
gives to our reasonable Nature, in debasing it to a Level,
with that of Brutes, or below it, thro' acquitting us from
all Obligations, by Virtue of any <hi>Internal Dictamina,</hi> or <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectual
Reasonings,</hi> to Justice, Mercy, and Truth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and
that our Engagements thereunto are only owing to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacts
and Bargains one with another. How much more is
Mr. <hi>Alsop</hi>'s Divinity in his <hi>Praxis</hi> (whatsoever other Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy
or Philosophy he may have in the <hi>Theory)</hi> to be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horr'd,
in that it supersedes all Truth and Sincerity among
men, whether resulting from <hi>Internal Dictates, External
Revelation,</hi> or <hi>Social Covenants</hi> and <hi>Agreements.</hi> For as the
two <hi>Pillars of Truth,</hi> and <hi>Branches of Veracity,</hi> upon which
all Society is superstructed, are, <hi>that one Man shall not lie to
another,</hi> and <hi>that he shall upon no Provocations belie him;</hi>
neither obtrude that upon the Faith of another, which he
that speaks or writes, doth not Himself believe, mean, or
intend, nor fasten that Fact, or affix that Opinion unto a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
which he hath neither by <hi>Overtacts,</hi> nor any of those
<hi>Signs,</hi> by which the <hi>Internal Sentiments</hi> of a Man's Mind
do become discernable, given Proof and Manifestation of.
Of the Reverse of each of which, Mr. <hi>Williams,</hi> as well as
Mr. <hi>Alsop,</hi> are Guilty in the Highest degree. And that both
thro masquing, disguising, and dissembling their own Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions;
and by misrepresenting, and falsly construing the
Opinions of others; and by imputing those Notions to them,
for which they have not only the greatest Aversion in their
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:62502:42"/>
Minds, but have testified it by all the ways and means that
would satisfie such as are not resolv'd out of <hi>Picque</hi> against
a Party, as well as against certain Persons, to have Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency
come under the Ignominy, and to suffer the Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Guilt. Nor should I say an undecent, and much
less a severe thing, if I should call them the <hi>Nuisances of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties</hi>
of every kind and that they deserve to be thrust
out from having any share in the Priviledge and Benefit, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of a <hi>Civil Corporation,</hi> or of <hi>Church Communion.</hi> And as
no Subjects can be safe under any <hi>Form of Government</hi> what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever,
where Defamations are not only practised and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged,
but accounted Evidences of Zeal for God, and
of Loyalty to the King, so no Supream Rulers, by what
names soever dignified, can be secure either as to their
Persons, or their <hi>Governing Authority,</hi> where the measures,
by which these Men manage themselves, are allowed to
escape without Publick Censure. For to speak or write of
those whom one dislikes, with a Liberty and Unrestrained<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
as if every thing were lawful to be pronounced of
them, which may detract from their Reputation, as Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
Scholars and Ministers, is to dissolve the Ligaments
of <hi>Society,</hi> and to turn <hi>Churches, Corporations</hi> and <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms,</hi>
into a worse Confusion than that of <hi>Babel,</hi> where e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
one spake what he meant, tho thro the Novelty, as well
as the diversity of their Languages, they could not at first
understand one another. Whosoever accuseth his Neighbour
unjustly, in a Book addressed by him to the World, is as
much a <hi>Delator,</hi> and ought to bear the Disgrace due to such,
and to pass for one that is no less <hi>Suborned</hi> by his <hi>Envy, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice,</hi>
and <hi>Revenge,</hi> to be a <hi>slanderous Informer;</hi> than as if for
the Lucre of money he should perjuriously depose at the
<hi>Kings Bench,</hi> or <hi>Session House.</hi> And tho such Detractors
may not in all Cases be Arraignable before my <hi>Lord Chief
Justice;</hi> yet it is not for the Interest of Mankind, nor for
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:62502:43"/>
the Peace of Communities, that they should be let go
without the Suffering of some sort of Discipline, which
is the alone Reason, and not any Personal Quarrel
with or against the Men, why I have assumed the
Freedom, and Charged my self with the Trouble of giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it them.</p>
            <p>The last <hi>Reflection</hi> which I will make upon this <hi>Insincere</hi>
and <hi>Defamatory</hi> way of <hi>Writing,</hi> is, that it is Extreamly
<hi>prejudicial</hi> to <hi>Religion,</hi> and adapted to do more hurt by the
Temptations and Encouragements which it Administers
to render people <hi>Prophane,</hi> than, on the supposition that
the Writer were in the right in every thing that is Doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,
all his Arguments can do good by the making and
preserving men <hi>Orthodox.</hi> Seeing such are the Frame and
Complexion of the Minds and Spirits of the Generality,
that Practice and Example are more Observed, and have a
greater Influence upon them, than bare Teaching and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions
usually have. In that there is no advantage
thought to be gained by <hi>Hypocrisy</hi> in the former; Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
it may be Imagined Subservient in the latter to several
peculiar Ends. And of all People Ministers of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
are most liable to be Judged by that <hi>Criterion,</hi> both
in reference to the reality of their own Religion, and as to
the Opinion which they have of all Religion in general;
and to have it concluded from their Manners, what their
Inward Belief is. Nor will they be held perswaded of the
Being of a God, or World to come; the Tenor of whose
Practice is such, as if there were not. Neither will the
Preaching up of Sincerity, Meekness and Charity, be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
Esteemed than as <hi>Grimace</hi> and <hi>Pageantry;</hi> while
Falshood, Malice, Petulancy, and Defamation, are the whole
of what is to be seen in the <hi>Morals</hi> of him that Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.
Whence it is Both commonly and reasonably said,
that tho the <hi>Speculative Atheist</hi> be a <hi>Fool,</hi> considering the
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:62502:43"/>
many Convincing Means he is furnished with, both within
and without him, in himself, and whatsoever doth surround
him, to ascertain him of a <hi>Deity;</hi> yet the <hi>Practical</hi> one is
of the two pronounced to be the greatest <hi>Knave,</hi> in that the
<hi>latter dispiseth</hi> and <hi>affronts</hi> God, while the <hi>former</hi> doth only
<hi>deny</hi> him. Nor can any thing be more fatally mischievous,
both to the <hi>Personal</hi> and <hi>Publick Ends</hi> of Religion, than for
those whose Office it is to inform the Minds and the Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences,
and to govern the Lives of Men, by the Truth and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
of it; to set them a Pattern in and by their own Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice,
importing that the whole which they deliver unto,
and press upon others, they do themselves believe to be
Fable and Romance. But the damage of this kind done
to Religion by Mr. <hi>Alsop</hi>'s way of managing the <hi>Doctrinal
Controversies</hi> of it, being so obvious to all who will give
themselves Liberty to think, is therefore neither the only
nor the principal <hi>Topick,</hi> by and upon which I would repri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
him, in reference to this matter. That then, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
I would charge, and for which I would rebuke and
chastise him, is, that in the whole Frame and Texture of
his late Writings, he must either thro' Malice directly design,
or thro Folly and Distraction occasion and promote Schism
and Division among <hi>Dissenters,</hi> and give Ground not only
for alienation, but for Bitterness of Spirit in one Party
against the other. The whole Tendency of what he hath
published in the two Books which he hath lately emitted,
being not only to separate and divide the <hi>Dissenters</hi> into
two distinct Parties (which they already are) but to <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shal</hi>
and <hi>Rendevouze</hi> them into opposite Factions, in order
either to make both of them a Prey to such as may have
a Mind to overthrow the Liberty which is at present gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
and indulged them; or at least to crush and subvert the
Freedom of those among them that cannot come into the
Terms of a <hi>Comprehension</hi> with the Dignitaries and Pastors
of the <hi>Di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>cesan</hi> and establish'd Form. And if I durst define
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:62502:44"/>
and conclude the Inclinations of the whole <hi>Presbyterian Body,</hi>
by the <hi>Overt-acts</hi> of Mr. <hi>Alsop</hi> and Mr. <hi>Williams,</hi> I should
be tempted to say, that they of the <hi>Congregational Way</hi> were
not only to have the <hi>Liberty</hi> vouchsafed them by Law
withdrawn, and the <hi>Act</hi> repealed; but that they were to be
made obnoxious to some new and penal <hi>Statute.</hi> Seeing
were they guilty of the <hi>Antinomian</hi> Notions they are charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with, not only of Emasculating and Corrupting the
whole Gospel, and of turning it into a <hi>Lampoon</hi> upon the
Righteousness, Wisdom, Holiness and Veracity of God, but
of perverting it into a Scandal and Reproach of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer
thro' the Licentiousness, which <hi>Antinomian</hi> Tenets
give mental Biaz, as well as Doctrinal Countenance unto;
they would be so far from deserving the Benefit of a Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
of Indulgence and Liberty, that they ought to fall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Severest Restraints of Law, as those who <hi>Travestie</hi>
the whole Christian Religion, and pervert it into a <hi>Scheme</hi>
that justifieth Immorality and Ungodliness. For tho' I
neither will nor dare pronounce of those who thro' Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Thought, Pre-possessions by Education, or the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happiness
of Acquaintance, have imbib'd those Principles,
that they are practically wicked; yet I will be bold to say,
that their Virtue and Piety are not so much to be resolv'd
into the Light and Efficacy of their Principles, as into the
<hi>Mechanical Fabrick</hi> of their Bodies; upon which, both the
Grave, Reserv'd, and Sober Temper of their Minds, and
the want of Incitement, Food and Aliment to Scandalous
Transgressions in their Lives, do very much depend; or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
into the Efficacious Renewing and Sanctifying <hi>Grace of
God,</hi> which to Souls that are sincere and upright in their
Intentions, tho' mistaken in their Opinions, giveth a victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Prevalency over the Errors of the Understanding, as
well as over the Lusts of the Heart; <hi>the Law of the Spirit
of Life in Christ Jesus administring a Redemption in both from
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:62502:44"/>
the Law of Sin and Death.</hi> But it is the Happiness of you
<hi>Reverend Pastors and Elders of the Congregational Way,</hi> that
you do not only at present live under a King, who hath
more Temper as well as Wisdom, than to hearken to two
very mean and indifferent <hi>Predicants,</hi> and who upon all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Accounts, save the overvaluing themselves, are much
less Men than they are Preachers, that would upon the
Ruins of the Reputation, Learning and Piety of their Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
advance themselves into two <hi>Dictatorial</hi> and <hi>Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archal
Seats</hi> over the Body of <hi>Dissenters;</hi> but that you are
under the Care and Protection of a <hi>National Senate,</hi> who
upon preceding <hi>Specimens,</hi> know by what Rules of <hi>Huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
Equity</hi> or <hi>Justice</hi> (not to say of Christianity) the <hi>Bigots</hi>
of that Faction do govern themselves. I do freely acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
that there is no Man of more Latitude as to Principles
and Measures of Charity, good Nature, and Civil Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
than I desire to be; yet I can no ways allow that
<hi>Religion</hi> should be made a Cloak to cover Passions and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry
Resentments, or turn'd into an Engine and Tool,
whereby to support, carry on, and justifie Passion and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge.
For when I judge of Persons and Things with the
greatest Impartiality and Temperance, I cannot but reckon
that all the unjust Accusations and Calumnies, which one
Writer fastneth upon another, must not only serve to afford
Diversion and Sport to the <hi>Prophane,</hi> and yield Matter of
Contempt for all <hi>Religion</hi> to the <hi>Atheistical,</hi> but that they
will give Offence and Scandal not only to the Pious and Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous,
but to the Civil, and the Well-bred part of Mankind. I
could readily, both bear with, and esteem any Man, that
sheweth Zeal for his Theological Belief, whether he be in
the right or wrong, provided he doth not express <hi>Viru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence;</hi>
and in the room of exercising <hi>Charity,</hi> doth not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ert
<hi>Wrath</hi> and <hi>Malice;</hi> nor in the place of Arguments, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
and advance <hi>Reproaches</hi> and <hi>Calumnies.</hi> But I do both
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:62502:45"/>
thank God, and take Pleasure in my self, to find that I am
by Education, Principles and Temper, carried into the
greatest Aversation imaginable of those, who in Discourses
on Subjects of Divinity, where only <hi>Scriptural Authority,
strong Reason,</hi> and <hi>Modesty of Expression,</hi> should be allowed,
abandon themselves to the Licentiousness of Drollery, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr,
Pasquinade, and Calumny. And who, when they
should be <hi>sober Disputants,</hi> turn <hi>Buffoons, Marphorio's,</hi> or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilers.
Nor are a <hi>Jack-Pudding</hi> on a <hi>Mountebank Stage,</hi> or a

a credible <hi>Evidence,</hi> more disagreable and displeasing Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects

Disputant</hi> turn'd a <hi>Pasquin,</hi> and a <hi>Satyrist.</hi> Whereunto all
that I will here subjoyn, and with which I will close this
Head of Accusation and Reprimand of Mr. <hi>Alsop,</hi> is, that
the Carriage and Behaviour of Him, and of Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
those of the <hi>Congregational Perswasion,</hi> is no less shapen
and moulded (but whether intentionally or not I will not say)
to the Abuse &amp; Perversion of the Liberty, which the <hi>Dissenters</hi>
have by Law obtain'd, first into their <hi>Reproach</hi> and <hi>Dishonour,</hi>
and then into their Ruine; than the Freedom which <hi>Julian</hi>
the <hi>Apostate</hi> granted to the Various <hi>Sects</hi> of <hi>Christians</hi> under
his Reign, was by him designed both to their Destruction,
and the Extirpation of the Christian Religion. For as
that Cunning and Wise, tho Malicious Emperor against
<hi>Christianity,</hi> Tolerated all the Dissentient Parties of that
Religion, not out of Favour to it or them, but upon an
hope and Prospect of their Qnarrelling with, their Revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
and their Endeavouring to Destroy one another; so
both Mr. <hi>Alsop</hi> and Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>m to make it their <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince</hi>
               <pb n="83" facs="tcp:62502:45"/>
to abuse the <hi>Liberty,</hi> which hath been Graciously,
and upon Honest, Prudent, and kind Inducements Vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safed
unto <hi>Dissenters,</hi> into that Occasion of Envy, Strife
and Rancour among themselves, and into a Provocation as
well as an opportunity of Maliciously Slandring and defam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a Considerable part of the Body of <hi>Dissenters,</hi> as <hi>Hete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rodox,</hi>
and in reality Subverters of the <hi>Christian Faith,</hi>
(the Charge of <hi>Antimonianism</hi> importing no less) and of
some of them as Treacherous and Disloyal Conspirators
against His Majesties Person and the Government, which
both must and ought, according to all the Measures of Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
and Justice, produce as the Consequent and Event,
a <hi>Repeal</hi> of the <hi>Statute</hi> by which they are possessed of
Freedom with Respect to their <hi>Religious Assemblies,</hi> and
<hi>Pastoral Exercises,</hi> and do stand Covered from all <hi>Obnoxious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi>
to those <hi>Mulcts</hi> and <hi>Penalties,</hi> whereunto they were by
former Laws liable upon the single Foot of <hi>Conscience</hi> and
<hi>Religion.</hi> Or the least thing which this <hi>Buffoonry,</hi> Petu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant
and Defamatory way of Writing must in Reason effect,
will be the Rendring them the Subjects of the Scorn and
Derision of those of the <hi>National</hi> and <hi>Establisht Church.</hi>
So that I do not wonder, if some of the greatest <hi>States-Men,</hi>
as well as of the Principal <hi>Dignitaries</hi> of the <hi>Prelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi>
Way, do think that they who were at the <hi>Helm</hi> in the
Reign of <hi>Charles 2d.</hi> were wonderfully Mistaken in their
<hi>Politicks</hi> of Suppressing <hi>Dissenters,</hi> and of destroying <hi>Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conformity</hi>
to <hi>Episcopacy,</hi> and their Church forms and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline,
by Rigorous Laws and Statutes, which only Served
to make them Stifle and Conceal their Passions one against
another; and upon the Encouragement of their Numbers
to unite and Combine into a Faction <hi>Inimicous</hi> to the State,
as they were before unfriendly to the Church. Whereas
if the Way of <hi>Indulgence</hi> had in that Reign been fallen upon
and pursued, some of the <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> who have <hi>Popes</hi> as well
as Bishops and <hi>Arch-Bishops</hi> in their Bellyes, would long
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:62502:46"/>
er'e this have run into the Road of arriving at Mitres, and
of Grasping the <hi>Crosier Staff,</hi> if for no other Reason than
that of using the Butt End of the <hi>Latter</hi> to knock those
of the Congregational Way on the <hi>Head;</hi> instead of Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying
the <hi>Crook</hi> for drawing them gently and with meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
either into their own or a Nationall Communion. I
will not discover at present, whom I know of Court <hi>Pension<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>artes</hi>
among the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Ministers, nor what their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spective
<hi>Pensions</hi> have been, seeing I am well assured, that
they were not Originally granted in order to promote
Quarrels among, themseves, nor to be the <hi>Sallaries</hi> of Buf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foons,
Fabulists, or Revilers; but partly to Relieve men of
true Piety and of Singular Worth, whose parts, and merit
made them Capable of the most Honourable and Beneficial
Stations in the National Church, if their Principles would
have allowed their Qualifying themselves to have accepted
of them; and partly to purchase and restrain some little, but
stirring and peevish Ecclesiasticks among them, from being
<hi>Demagogues</hi> against the Government, and to gain them to be
<hi>Panagyrists</hi> for it, and render them Partizans, Zealots, and
Advocates for it's Support, instead of their turning <hi>Saty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rists</hi>
to disparage it, and of reassuming the Practise of
beating their Ancient <hi>Tune</hi> again upon the <hi>Pulpit Drum.</hi> And
forasmuch, as some Reverend Pastors and Brethren, who have
enjoyed Some Advantages of knowing more of the little
Arts and Tricks, which have been used, and I am afraid
Still are, to render your Principles and Way, and Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
your Persons and Churches the objects of State
Jealousie; I shall therefore in a word or two shew the Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness
of your principles (I might say beyond those of some
other Dissenters) to Civil Government; and that if your
Tenets were but duly understood, you would be never Sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
(provided you be true unto and act Conformably
unto them) as persons who can or will Encroach upon, or
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:62502:46"/>
supplant the <hi>Authority</hi> and <hi>Jurisdiction</hi> of <hi>Magistrates.</hi> And
as I do reckon that <hi>Church Frame</hi> and <hi>Form</hi> of <hi>Ecclesiastical
Regimen</hi> and <hi>Discipline,</hi> to have most of a <hi>Divine Impression</hi> and
<hi>Stamp</hi> upon it, which is of all others the Friendliest to <hi>Politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Authority,</hi> and is the furthest from Interfering with true <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistratical
Power;</hi> so I have not the best Opinion of that <hi>Scheme</hi>
of <hi>Church-Government,</hi> which erects <hi>Dominium in dominio,</hi>
(which is the Constitution in a <hi>Neighbouring Church,</hi>
and to whose <hi>Pattern</hi> some People covenanted to conform,
as the best in all the <hi>Reformed Churches)</hi> and against the
Natural Effects whereof, in its Genuine Execution, they who
bear the <hi>Temporal Sword</hi> are not secure in their <hi>Seats of Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,</hi>
without being at the Expense of finding now and then
a <hi>new pair of Shooes,</hi> to accommodate such <hi>Ecclesiasticks</hi> for
Travelling, as do but vigorously exert their <hi>Church</hi> and
<hi>Disciplinarian Principles.</hi> For the <hi>Kingdom of our Lord Jesus
Christ not being of this World,</hi> it necessarily followeth, that
the <hi>Institutions,</hi> by, and upon which he hath erected his
<hi>Church,</hi> and the Rules which he hath prescrib'd for its Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulation,
can neither be such as may Infringe the Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
nor weaken the Jurisdiction of the <hi>Civil Magistrate,</hi>
whose Establishment and Ruling Power, as he took for
granted; so he came not to subvert, but to confirm them.
Nor was it inconsistent with the Wisdom and Goodness of
our <hi>Holy</hi> and <hi>Blessed Lord,</hi> to have made it the Duty of Men
and Women, to embrace the <hi>Christian Faith,</hi> and to aggre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate
themselves into <hi>Church-Societies,</hi> in all Nations and
Dominions whatsoever, and at the same time to persevere
in an Obedience to the Civil Laws of their several and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spective
Soveraigns and Rulers, if what he requir'd of them,
as so many Corporations of Believers had not been eminent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>Amicous,</hi> as well as reconcileable to the various Forms
and Schemes of <hi>Political Government.</hi> And thence it was
that the Apostle St. <hi>Paul</hi> having once and again put the
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:62502:47"/>
               <hi>Divine Sanction</hi> upon the Duties owing by Subjects to Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers,
without making the least Abatement in the Obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of any, by reason of their being Christians, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
that the Secular Rules and Measures, by which
Nations were then govern'd, favour'd more of <hi>Despotical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi>
in some places, than they did in others; he doth also
not only adjudge all Disobedience to just Laws to Punishment,
by those whose Office it is <hi>not to bear the Sword in vain;</hi> but
doth brand all Usurpation upon the <hi>Magistratical Power</hi>
with a Vergency to <hi>Antichristianism,</hi> and thereby declares
both that all Principles introduced into <hi>Church Frames,</hi> and
<hi>Ecclesiastical Schemes</hi> of <hi>Discipline,</hi> of a Tendency to wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
and supplant the <hi>Civil Authority,</hi> are dissonant from,
and opposite to the Institutions of our Lord Jesus Christ.
And that all Trespasses of that Hue and Alliance, are depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
from the Rules of the Gospel, as well as they are
Crimes against the Statutes and <hi>Pandects</hi> of Nations. So
that upon the foremention'd <hi>Scripture Hypothesis</hi> of <hi>Church
Power,</hi> your Principles, (Reverend Pastors and Brethren of
the <hi>Congregational way)</hi> are plainly such, that if conform'd un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
you can never become the Objects of the Jealousie of
the <hi>Civil-Magistrate,</hi> nor deserve to have that Liberty with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn,
which is now vouchsafed you. And which the
<hi>Dissenters</hi> having gotten at first into a Precarious Possession
of, thro' a <hi>Dispensing Power,</hi> claim'd by King <hi>James,</hi> they
are more indebted unto that, than they are aware of, for
the being establish'd in it by a Law under this Reign. For,
Gentlemen, as your Principles seem no ways disagreeable to
the Nature of a <hi>Christian Church,</hi> (tho far be it from me at
present to give them the Preference to those of the <hi>Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal
Communion)</hi> so they are neither exerciseable beyond
the Circumference of <hi>Ecclesiastical Fellowship,</hi> nor do they
any ways extend to what is the Subject or Object of the
<hi>Magistrates Jurisdiction.</hi> For as the Essence of a <hi>Church,</hi> as
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:62502:47"/>
it is a <hi>Society</hi> distinct from other <hi>Communities,</hi> is to be a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting
<hi>Association</hi> of Men and Women, upon such prescribed
Holy and Evangelical Terms, both of Faith and Obedience,
in order to the Enjoyment of <hi>Spiritual Priviledges,</hi> and the
becoming entitled to special Divine Mercies and Blessings;
so the whole Authority challeng'd by those of the <hi>Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
Perswasion</hi> over their Members, is to exact of them a
Compliance with those Terms, both in point of Belief and
Practice, or otherwise, to seclude and debar them from all
share in the Priviledges which Christ has settled upon them
alone who do observe them. And as all therefore which
those stiled <hi>Independants</hi> do make <hi>Penal</hi> in their <hi>Ecclesiastical
Discipline,</hi> is meerly the precluding unqualified Persons, and
Members, who walk disorderly from any Portion in those Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits
and Priviledges, which Christ hath vested in his <hi>Church,</hi>
as it is a Society chose out of the World, and distinct from
<hi>Secular Communities,</hi> which consequently reacheth to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
that lies properly within the Sphere of the <hi>Magistrate;</hi>
so they do not even inflict that, save upon those who in
their consenting <hi>Association</hi> with them, submitted to be so
treated, if they answer'd not the Terms which Christ
hath made the Qualification for, and the Conditions of a
Right to an <hi>actual Participation</hi> in such and such Blessings
and Priviledges. 'Tis possible that what I have been now
delivering, will by some be accounted a Digression from
the Subject that I am upon, (and which, if it so were, I do
nevertheless hope, every discreet Reader, as well as you Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend
Pastors and Brethren, will easily pardon) tho' as to
my self I can neither think nor own it to be one: Because
of the Provocation, as well as the Occasion administred for
it; and that not only thro' Mr. <hi>Alsop</hi>'s and Mr. <hi>William</hi>'s
traducing a <hi>Congregational Pastor,</hi> (who is known to act
as uniformly to his Principles, as any Man whatsoever)
but by reason of Mr. <hi>Williams</hi>'s slandering all who will
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:62502:48"/>
not espouse his Heterodoxies in Divinity, who are by
much the Majority of those who are of the <hi>Congregational
Perswasion;</hi> and justifie his Treacherous, because Surrepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious,
Clandestine, and disguised abandoning of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
receiv'd Doctrines of the <hi>Reformed Churches</hi> in <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentous
Articles of Faith,</hi> as being therefore <hi>Instruments in
the Breaches,</hi> (for that is the Term which his Breeding and
Modesty have taught him to express a not acquiescing in
his <hi>Arminian</hi> and <hi>Socianizing Notions</hi> by) upon <hi>design</hi> of
<hi>Sacrificing the common Interest,</hi> i.e. of the King and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
thro' a Subversion of the Government, <hi>P.</hi> 86. of
his <hi>Answer to the Report.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But beginning to grow weary of raking in a Kennel,
and being no ways ambitious either of Emulating or Imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
that <hi>Hero,</hi> among the rest of whose Celebrated Works,
the cleansing the <hi>Augean</hi> Stable was not the least labourious
and toilsome, tho neither the most honourable in it self, nor
grateful to the Senses; I shall only insist upon one Head or
<hi>Topick</hi> more in Mr. <hi>Alsop</hi>'s late Writings; namely, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead
of confining Himself to Points of <hi>Doctrine</hi> that were to
be debated, or to those Matters of Fact, which he might
either really believe would be subservient to his Passion and
Revenge, or which he might Romantickly imagine were
Controvertible between him and Mr. <hi>Lobb,</hi> he hath most
impertinently, foolishly, immorally, and irreligiously in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulged
himself in Detractions and Invectives, that are meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>Personal.</hi> And which respect, neither <hi>Doctrinal Errors,</hi>
nor <hi>Historical Mistakes</hi> in his Adversaries; but at the most,
either <hi>Bodily Defects,</hi> shortness in those <hi>Mental Perfections,</hi>
which some may be furnish'd with. Failures in <hi>Punctilio's</hi>
of <hi>Courtship;</hi> little Oversights, to which, both the best and
wisest of Men are incident, or <hi>Aspersions</hi> founded upon pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
<hi>Lyes.</hi> Nor do his <hi>Personal Obloquies</hi> and <hi>Defamations</hi>
               <pb n="89" facs="tcp:62502:48"/>
terminate meerly in <hi>Laicks,</hi> and those of the mean <hi>Populace,</hi>
but they are levell'd against Ministers of the <hi>Gospel,</hi> and
Persons of deserv'd Esteem and Reputation in the World.
Neither are his Sarcasms and Satyrical Invectives restrain'd
only to the <hi>Living,</hi> but they extend unto, and are design'd
to <hi>smut</hi> and <hi>blacken</hi> the Memory of the <hi>Dead;</hi> yea, they
are calculated not only to affect single <hi>Individuals,</hi> and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Persons, but they are framed, and intended to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spatter
<hi>Fellowships</hi> and <hi>Communities.</hi> For as Men's <hi>Credit</hi> is
both one of the most essential and material Parts of their
<hi>Property,</hi> and accounted by many not only of equal, but
of a Transcendent Value to their Lives; it is therefore fit
that whosoever doth either openly or clandestinely invade
it, should be mark'd out, and branded as one that is more
Criminal, both in the Court of <hi>Honour,</hi> and at a <hi>Moral Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunal;</hi>
than he that picks a Pocket in the Crowd, or takes
a Purse on the Road. For to be a <hi>Maroder</hi> and <hi>Pillager</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Street and Field of <hi>Humane Credit</hi> and <hi>Reputation,</hi>
is worse both in it self, and in the Consequences of it, than
to turn common <hi>Padders</hi> on the King's Highway. Nor
do the latter deserve so much to be pursued by the <hi>Hue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>and-Cry</hi>
of the <hi>Country,</hi> as the former do deserve to be hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
and run down by the <hi>Social</hi> and <hi>Virtuous</hi> part of <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.</hi>
And tho' our Laws do only entitle the <hi>Grand Nobless</hi>
to the Priviledge of pursuing those upon Actions of <hi>Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalum,</hi>
who are found to have Ignominiously detracted
from, or insolently invaded their Reputation; yet both the
Rules of <hi>Chivalry,</hi> and the Maxims adopted among the
Learned, as well as among the well-bred, give them not
only the Liberty of self-defence, but the Right of Reprizal
upon whosoever steps forth as a <hi>Draw can bully,</hi> to stab and
murther Persons in their <hi>Credit</hi> and <hi>Reputation.</hi> For tho an
Enemy acting by a <hi>Lawful Commission,</hi> and keeping within
the Boundaries chalk'd out and legitimated for the Manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:62502:49"/>
of a Lawful War, is to have both Quarter allow'd
him, and to be treated with Humanity, when subdued and
conquered; yet such as are <hi>Free-Booters</hi> and <hi>Pickasoons,</hi>
ought to expect no better, than to be made <hi>Gally-Slaves,</hi> or
to be hang'd up at the <hi>Yards-Arm.</hi> Nor is it either less of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fensive
or prejudicial to Persons of all Degrees, to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted
from, and made contemptible in Reference to their
Understandings, than to have their Manners exclaimed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst,
expos'd and reproached. Yea, the Generality would
rather submit to be thought and call'd <hi>Knaves,</hi> than to be
held and represented for <hi>Fools.</hi> And God having design'd our
<hi>Intellectual Faculties</hi> for those, by which we are especially
to be distinguished from all sorts of <hi>Brutes,</hi> whether they
be the Wanton and Sportful, or the Voracious and Fierce;
he hath in his Providential Wisdom, pursuant thereunto,
impress'd upon all People an Apprehension of equalling o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
in Prudence; tho' they may at the same time readily
acknowledge others to be Richer, Stronger, more Beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
and Sublimer in Dignity than themselves. And this is
peculiarly remarkable in God's Sapiential Government of
the World; that where he hath given the fewer <hi>Rational
Abilities,</hi> he hath bestowed upon those the most Degrees of
<hi>Self-Conceit,</hi> which do as well for the Men's Satisfaction.
Nor do we need any other Instances and Examples to ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie
that of the Poet, <hi>Qui velit ingenio cedere rarus</hi>—
than my two snarling <hi>Divines;</hi> who tho' in their Bulk upon
all Accounts, being not much bigger among Men, than Toads
are among the Reptile Race, and in their Nature not very
dissimular from them, have the Ambition to swell into the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mensions
of an <hi>Ox,</hi> albeit liable to the same Misfortune with
those loathsome and poysonous Animals in the Fable,
of bursting in the Attempt. But that I may not be
thought to accuse Mr. <hi>Alsop</hi> in a Matter of Fact, whereof
he is innocent, I shall therefore, both to justifie my own
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:62502:49"/>
Integrity in Charging him, and to make his Criminalness
demonstratively appear, call over some passages out of his
own Books, as so many Indubitable Testimonies both of the
Truth of the Impeachment which I have entred against
him, and of the justness of the Rebukes which I design to
give him. Whereof the first shall be that, p. 33. of the
<hi>Vindic.</hi> of his <hi>Reb.</hi> whereupon no other nor higher pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation,
than Mr. <hi>Lobb's</hi> having said, that Mr. <hi>Alsop</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
in such a Year to write a Preface to a certain Book
of his, which he was then Writing against <hi>Antinomianism,</hi>
in order to <hi>Midwife it into the World,</hi> as Mr. <hi>Lobb</hi> innocent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and without any design of Reflection on Mr. <hi>Alsop,</hi> or
of the least surmize that any could be Incensed by it to
throw about Squibbs, and Firebrands of wrath and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice;
this Peevish, Unmannerly, and Lunatick Writer,
breaks out into all the Rudeness of Personal Aspersion,
which his Pride and Wrath could Dictate, and so narrow
a Language as ours vent and express. For as the thing
was in it self a meer <hi>Bagatell,</hi> and neither worthy nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
upon their discoursing about it to be kept secret;
So nothing can more discover the Folly, and at the same
time the Exorbitant Passion and Rancour of Mr. <hi>Alsop,</hi>
than his Calling Mr. <hi>Lobb</hi>'s Discovering and Publishing of
it, <hi>One of the most sordid Pieces of Baseness in the World;
a betraying of Private Conversation; a Rudely revealing the
most Innocent Passages of Friendly Correspondence; a Villany
to be Banisht all Conversation and Commerce;</hi> With more
stuff of the same Nonsensicalness, which for Mr. <hi>Alsop</hi>'s sake
I forbear to repeat. Nor can any be guilty of writing with
such satyrical Wildness, by way of <hi>Personal</hi> Reflexion upon
a Minister of the Gospel, and who was once his Friend, but
one that had either never Learned, or thro' being <hi>Superan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuated,</hi>
hath forgotten the Rules and Measures prescribed
for the Government of Conversation among Men. For ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:62502:50"/>
to this method of Censuring, nothing talkt of in
Conversation, tho' never so trivial, must be discovered,
and repeated to others. And thereby an end must be put to
all Society, which is Cultivated not only in order to divert
and improve our selves, but that we may Learn how we
stand in the favour, esteem, and confidence of those with
whom we Converse, and what Offices of Friendship they
may be willing to render us, or what they may expect, and
need that we should pay unto them. Tho I have been for
some time in the World, and have both enjoyed opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of Admission into great Variety of Fellowship, and
have studied, as much as I thought necessary, the Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
not only of Truth, Justice, and Honour; but of Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion
and Friendship, as to the Concealment of what may
be Communicated by one to an other; yet I coule never
hitherto Learn, that a man was to be Accounted a <hi>Villain,</hi>
or a <hi>Betrayer of Conversation,</hi> unless he was either under an
Antecedent promise not to discover what should be said, or
that the thing was of that <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Consequence,</hi> that the
Revealing of it would prejudice him in his Person, Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est,
or Reputation, that had first spoken it. Nor can any
Man without Renouncing Common sense, and the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
accounted as Foolish or Distracted, as this Reflection on
Mr. <hi>Lobb</hi> doth bespeak Mr. <hi>Alsop</hi> to be, ever imagine that
it should be held enough to subject Mr. <hi>Lobb</hi> to the Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter
of a <hi>Villain,</hi> and a <hi>Betrayer of Private Conversation,</hi> &amp;c.
Meerly because he had said that Mr. <hi>Alsop</hi> was once so far
from being <hi>Antinomian,</hi> that he undertook to Recommend
a Discourse of his to the World, which he was then about
publishing against <hi>Antinomianism.</hi> But it abundantly
shews, that the Man under all his boasted of Attainments,
to Wit, Wisdom and Learning, was either all his Days a
meer <hi>Boy,</hi> or that he is become twice a <hi>Child;</hi> otherwise it
were not possible that he should raise such a Noise and Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cry,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:62502:50"/>
as if he were stab'd, or at least impeached of High
Treason; only because of a Word spoken of him, which
can no more hurt or affect him, than the saying he Lives
and Preaches somewhere at <hi>Westminster,</hi> and now and then
meets with the Presbyterian Ministers at St. <hi>Hellens,</hi> could
reasonably be Judged to do. Only the Poor Man's under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
is dwindled into that diminutive size (if ever it
was of a larger dimension,) That to take his <hi>Marvels</hi> from
him, or to blow upon his <hi>Soap Bubles,</hi> is equally Affrontive
unto and Resented by him, as if <hi>Burglary</hi> were Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
upon his House, or a Conspiracy form'd against his
Life. Had Mr. <hi>Lobb</hi> discovered all his Obligations to King
<hi>James</hi> (which his Friend Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> intimates to have
been very great, by his saying, <hi>They were somewhat peculiar,</hi>
p. 86. Of the <hi>Answ.</hi> to the <hi>Rep.)</hi> or had he published the
many Promises which he made both to His Late Majesty
Himself, and to others in order to have them Communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
unto him, how unchangeably he was in that <hi>Prince's</hi>
Interest, and with what unalterable <hi>Fealty,</hi> he would ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here
unto and serve him; This might have been Construed
as a Piece of Ill Nature, because Detective both of the
Falshood of the Man to Him, and how <hi>Lubricous</hi> a Friend,
and Changeable a <hi>Partizan</hi> he will be to any Soveraign,
who has the weakness to give that Credit to his Word or
Oath, in Point of Loyalty and Allegiance, as to Rely upon
them; tho' even the Revealing of that by Mr. <hi>Lobb</hi> would
have been no Treachery, nor have made him Obnoxious
for the doing of it to the Character and Title of a <hi>Villain.</hi>
But seeing Mr. <hi>Lobb</hi> hath out of Generosity, and upon the
Score of Former Acquaintance and Friendship omitted it,
and hath Nevertheless been most Brutally as well as Inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manly
Treated by Mr. <hi>Alsop,</hi> I will (if occasion be further
administred) try by an other method how Favour may be
obtained at his hands; thro' disclosing not only the obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:62502:51"/>
of Mr. <hi>Alsop</hi> to King <hi>James,</hi> which Mr. <hi>Williams</hi>
doth only tell us in General to have <hi>been somewhat peculiar;</hi>
but by Revealing an hundred Assurances given to that
Prince of his Firm and Unalterable Loyalty, which Mr.
<hi>Williams</hi> had as little knowledge of, as himself hath ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd
Integrity in the keeping of them. Whereof, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
the World hath a true History, they will understand
(which is all I will say at present) to whom the Imputation
of <hi>Villain,</hi> and the Titles of being <hi>False</hi> and <hi>Treacherous,</hi>
do properly belong.</p>
            <p>But I proceed to an other Example of his weak Malice,
and of his Boorish unmannerliness in his <hi>Personally</hi> Reflect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on Mr. <hi>Lobb,</hi> and that shall be his upbraiding, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring
to expose him, because the <hi>Region</hi> of his lower
<hi>Belly</hi> is more ample and large, than it is found to be in
some other People. <hi>'Tis certain,</hi> says he, <hi>That Mr.</hi> Lobb <hi>is
always Big-belly'd, and more fear he should be brought to Bed
in the streets, like Pope Joan, than to need his Manual Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in Midwifing a Book into the World, or in the facilita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
his Labour in Teeming of Pamphlets,</hi> p. 32. of his <hi>Vind.</hi>
of the <hi>Faithf. Reb. And that he is so Bulky, as if the whole
Congregational Party was stowed in his Belly.</hi> p. 24. Where
omitting the Foppish, Pedantick, and Jack Pudding Wit
in these Passages, which the more he valueth Himself up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
the more Ridiculous he is in the esteem of all who have
good sense, or true Rellish; I shall at this Time only
Chastize and Discipline him upon the <hi>Topick</hi> of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching
Mr. <hi>Lobb</hi> with being always <hi>Big-belly'd, and of
that Prominence, as if he were to give stowage to the whole
Congregational Party.</hi> And the first Reprimand I would
give him is, that none who pretend to Prudence, Religion,
or good manners, will despise or ridicule an other, for that
which never fell under his Will or Choice to have had it o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise,
nor is it under his Power to give Remedy to it.
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:62502:51"/>
And all Objections fastned upon Persons, because of some
<hi>Anomolousness</hi> in their Bodily Structure and Fabrick, is an
Impeaching of the <hi>Divine Wisdom,</hi> and the commencing a
Quarrel against the Sovereignty of God. For all Defects or
Excesses that appear in our Mechanical Form and Frame,
provided they be not contracted, but natural; nor the Effects
of Intemperance and Luxury, but of the Elemental Juices in
our Constitution; as the Prominence of Mr. <hi>Lobb</hi>'s Belly is
known to be, are to be look'd upon rather with Pity, than
with Disdain, and ought to be turn'd into Matter of
Thankfulness to God, that it is not our own Case,
and not perverted into a Contempt of those, and the
rendring them a Jest, whose Misfortune it is to have
them. And very often they who have most about them
ungrateful to the Sight and View; have something which
doth signally recommend them to those nobler Faculties
from which we receive the Denomination of Men. Even
<hi>Esop,</hi> notwithstanding his having been the most deform'd
Creature that ever appear'd in Humane Shape, yet he will
in all Ages be admir'd for the Admirableness of his Wit,
the Profoundness of his Judgment, and the Incomparable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of his Art and Faculty, in teaching Virtue and Prudence
by <hi>Apologues,</hi> and in the way of <hi>Mythology.</hi> Nor is it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
of Remark, that <hi>Socrates,</hi> among the many other
Bodily Imperfections, yea, Deformities, which he is repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
to have had, is particularly describ'd and character'd
for having been <hi>Pot-belly'd;</hi> yet that was never thought
to detract from his being justly esteem'd a very wise and vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
Man, and as excellently learned and a profound Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losopher,
so one of the greatest Sense and Probity, the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blest
Moralist, and the justest Person that ever the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan</hi>
World brought forth. To which I will further add,
that <hi>Aristophanes,</hi> who was another kind of Man for Wit
than Mr. <hi>Alsop</hi> is (tho' for Haughtiness and Malice they seem
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:62502:52"/>
much of an Alliance) and who thro being both an Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then,
and one of those Poets that wrote for the <hi>Stage,</hi> to
give Sport and Diversion to the <hi>Mob,</hi> as well as to the vain
Immoral People of <hi>better Fashion,</hi> might have challeng'd
greater Freedoms, and have exercised more Licentiousness
in the Characters which he gave of Men, than a Christian
or Minister of the Gospel, is by the Laws of our Holy Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
or the Rules of good Manners among such who have
their Understandings enlightned, and Passions restrain'd by
<hi>Divine Revelations,</hi> are allowed to use; yet even <hi>He,</hi> when
he most designedly apply'd himself to render <hi>Socrates</hi> Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous,
as he did with all the Art, Malice, Fiction and
Falshood imaginable, in his Play, call'd the <hi>Clouds,</hi> shew'd both
better Sense, and did more consult the Credit of his own
Wit, than in the least to mention his being <hi>Pot-belly'd,</hi> (or
any of his Corporal Deformities, which were many) and
much less to make a Jest of him upon that Account. Which
of all things, Mr. <hi>Alsop</hi>'s brutal Rage, unmanly Revenge,
and <hi>Merry-Andrew</hi> Talent would not have omitted against one
whom he had singled out for an Adversary. And the
Reason is obvious, in that this <hi>Holder-Forth,</hi> in a Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian
Congregation somewhere about <hi>Westminster</hi> (but where
particularly I cannot tell) hath none of those Endowments
of Wit, to qualifie him for <hi>Raillery</hi> after a genteel manner,
which <hi>Aristophanes</hi> had; and must therefore be contented to
take up with the <hi>Billingsgate, Grubstreet,</hi> and <hi>Mountebank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stall,
Topicks of Satyr</hi> and <hi>Defamation.</hi> Nor do I think it was
ever heretofore believ'd, (till Mr. <hi>Alsop</hi> hath of late reveal'd
unto us the <hi>Arcanum</hi> of it) that we were, upon the Figure and
Proportion of a <hi>Man's Belly,</hi> to form Conjectures with refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
either to his <hi>Intellectuals</hi> or <hi>Morals,</hi> whereas very many
have said that there is another part about us, which carrieth
<hi>Signatures</hi> and <hi>Diagnosticks</hi> upon it, subservient to the mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Inferences of that kind. And as I have known divers
my self, who have had the Pictures, both of their Mental
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:62502:52"/>
Disposition, and of the Destiny that awaits them in their
Lives, imprinted pretty legibly upon their <hi>Foreheads;</hi> so
if Mr. <hi>Alsop</hi> will be but at the trouble to view himself in his
Glass, he may possibly see more of Waspishness and Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crisie
engraven upon that <hi>Brass Sign,</hi> than I am willing to
ascribe to him; yea, it may furnish him with more <hi>Oracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar</hi>
Hints of what <hi>Fate</hi> may overtake him before he leave
the World, than the <hi>Almanack</hi> could afford him, of which
he tells us, <hi>The Countess of</hi> Holland <hi>was brought to Bed.</hi> At
least he might have spell'd from the <hi>Hieroglyphicks</hi> and <hi>Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chigraphy</hi>
there, that all the Estimation for Wit, which his
whole Ambition hath been by the Scribling <hi>Talent,</hi> to attain
unto, would come to be exposed in its Shapes and Features
of Ridiculousness; and that the gay <hi>Flie,</hi> with his gilded
and noisie Wings, would be shew'd as Terminating in a mean
and despicable <hi>Worm.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are many more <hi>Personal Reflections</hi> of Mr. <hi>Alsop</hi>'s
upon Mr. <hi>Lobb,</hi> for which he deserves to be arraign'd, and
severely disciplin'd, were it not that I do reserve them in
<hi>Petto</hi> against another Re-encounter with this <hi>Hector, Bully,</hi>
and <hi>Draw can Sir,</hi> of the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Party, which I do
less fear than I am covetous of. And therefore all that I
will further subjoyn in reference thereunto, is the Contempt
which he every where expresseth both of his natural and
acquired Abilities. An Instance whereof we have, <hi>P. 15,
Vbi supra.</hi> Whereupon Mr. <hi>Lobb</hi>'s having said that Mr.
<hi>Alsop</hi> had been fool'd by Mr. <hi>Williams,</hi> this <hi>Westminster</hi>
Parson replies, in the way of his wonted Scorn, <hi>That the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legancy
of the Term he complains not of, because Witicisms and
Elegancies are great Rarities with him.</hi> And to the same
purpose, <hi>P.</hi> 21. where he tells us that Mr. <hi>Lobb</hi>'s <hi>Cruelty is
so severe, as if he would saw off his Head with an old rusty
Hand-Saw; and that whereas it would be some Comfort to be
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:62502:53"/>
rail'd at in handsome Language, it is the worst of Deaths to be
assassinated with dull and insipid Reflections, destitute of Wit
and Truth.</hi> And that <hi>P.</hi> 116. where Mr. <hi>Alsop</hi> doth assure
us, <hi>That Rhime will at any time with Mr.</hi> Lobb <hi>compensate the
want of Reason.</hi> To which may be subjoyn'd, that <hi>P.</hi> 29.
where he affirms, <hi>That Mr.</hi> Lobb <hi>is resolved thro thick and
thin, over Shooes, over Boots, thro' Truth and Falshood.</hi> Per fas
aut nefas, <hi>to defame, if he had Wit enough to Ridicule the
Writer of the Rebuke.</hi> Of an Alliance, whereunto is that
<hi>P.</hi> 12, 13. where he says, <hi>Mr. Lobb</hi>'s <hi>Talent is not to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meddle
with Accommodation of Matters, his special Gift being
to embarrass, confound, and perplex whatever he meddleth with.</hi>
Besides, a great deal more which followeth there of Childish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and Pedantry, which I do therefore forbear to repeat,
because I am not at present disposed to take Occasion from
it, of giving the World further Diversion and Sport, thro'
leading him longer about, and publickly shewing of him in
his Garb and Habit of Ridiculousness. But as to what I
have call'd over, I will presume to say in way of Return,
that it argueth extream want of Prudence, to despise an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy,
by whose Defeat and Conquest he was in hopes both
to have erected his <hi>Trophies,</hi> and to have rode, if not trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phantly,
into the <hi>Capitol,</hi> and to have there laid down the
Garland of his Victory in the Lap of <hi>Jupiter,</hi> at least to
have drawn Mr. <hi>Lobb</hi> after his Chariot to St. <hi>Hellens,</hi> and
to have been there welcom'd with the <hi>Eulogies</hi> and <hi>Panegy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricks</hi>
of two or three of that Assembly, if they had but Wit
adapted that way, proportionable to their Vanity. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
Mr. <hi>Alsop</hi>'s coming forth in his Warlike Accoutrements,
with such Contempt of his Adversaries, as we read ascribed
to his Cousin <hi>Don Quixot,</hi> in his Phrantick, as well as Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantick
Atchievments, doth only serve to make his being
disarm'd, and the having <hi>Moombran's</hi> Helmet snatch'd, (as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other would say besides my self) from his Coxcomb; and
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:62502:53"/>
his being soundly Buffetted, the more laugh'd at, and turn'd
into Mirth. And were the Man capable of penetrating in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Diversity of <hi>Intellectual Accomplishments;</hi> or had he
been conversant in Books written on the Subject of <hi>L' Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
D' Esprit,</hi> he would not despise any one for deficiency
in Rational Endowments, because his Faculty lieth not in the
being a <hi>Droll</hi> and a <hi>Buffoon.</hi> And wheresoever these last
Talents are found, or appear to be affected; it is an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible
Evidence, of a Want of Perfection of Understanding,
and of the not being furnished with a sound Judgment:
For there being no Specifical <hi>Difference</hi> (at least so far as
I can apprehend) among the Souls that are allotted for
the actuating Humane Bodies, it is very probable that all
the Diversity, either of the <hi>Theorical</hi> or <hi>Mechanical</hi> Parts of
one Man from another, is Primarily to be resolv'd into the
various <hi>Organizations</hi> and <hi>Textures</hi> of our Bodies; and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
into the different Temperament of the <hi>Brain, Blood,</hi>
and <hi>Animal Spirits,</hi> and secondarily into Education, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse,
Assiduity in Study, and most especially in the Art
and Mathematicalness of Thinking; and that thereupon, as
very few Men are of that Constitution and Frame, or of
that Intenseness and Skilfulness of Thought, as to be capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of attaining to many kinds, and much less to sublime
Degrees of Intellectual Perfection; so they, whose Biass of
Mind lies towards <hi>Bagatels</hi> and Trifles, and whose noblest
Talents are to give Diversion and Sport, are to be rank'd
among those whom the Sapiential and Governing Wisdom
of God hath destined to stand listed among the most Inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or
Individuals of the <hi>Humane Race.</hi> For tho true Wit quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies
a Man to be any thing, a Divine, a Statesman, a Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
a Lawyer, a Physician, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet the <hi>Bristol</hi> Colour and
Hue, without the <hi>Diamond</hi> Shinings, Sparklings, and Firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of it, do serve only to make those Ridiculous, who
would appear gay, thro' a valuing of themselves, and an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:62502:54"/>
on such as are unskilful and incompetent Judges, by
their Glass <hi>Bugles, French</hi> Pearl, and <hi>Welch</hi> Stones, instead
of being adorn'd with what is truly Oriental and Genuine.
Whereupon I will assume the Liberty further to say, That as
<hi>true Wit</hi> gives an Universal Capacity in proportion to the
measures of Application; so the Counterfeit of it produceth
inconceiveable Hurt and Damage in every Station and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment
whatsoever. But herein is the Immense Sapience,
and the Superlative Goodness of God to be admired, that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
all these Diversities of <hi>Intellectual Accomplishments,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
which there could be no Superiority, nor Subordination,
and consequently no Regiment in the World; yet all Men
are made sufficiently and equally capable, both for <hi>Moral</hi>
and <hi>Political Government,</hi> being abundantly furnished with
whatsoever Faculties or Powers are indispensably needful, for
knowing and loving God; understanding and obeying his
Precepts, accepting and relying upon a Mediator, giving
unreserv'd Credit to revealed Truths, embracing and trust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Promises; fearing and dreading Threatnings; and for
performing all the Relative and Social Duties; which are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted
of us, either towards Superiors, Equals, or those that
are beneath us. Only your half-witted People do turn ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Heterodoxal,</hi> or <hi>Bigots in Religion;</hi> Dogmatical or Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants
in Learning; Tools of Despoticalness; or Democratical
Demagogues in Politicks; Empiricks in Physick, Chicanes
in Law, and Buffoons in Pleasantry of Conversation. Nor
did I hardly ever know a Man Oracular in his Opinions,
but for want of Extensive Knowledge; Censorious of his
Brethren, who walk conscientiously, but thro' a Deficiency
in true Piety; a Refiner in Politicks, but thro' a Narrowness
either of Understanding, or of Experience; nor one given to
Drollery, but by reason of Indigency in good Sense, or from
Excess in Prophaneness. Nor are your Men either of the
most Elevated and Sublime, or they of the Jocular and Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:62502:54"/>
parts, the usefullest Instruments in glorifying God,
or benefiting others: The <hi>First,</hi> being too Exalted and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined
in their Notions to be generally understood; and the
<hi>Latter</hi> too Wanton and Sportful to mind what is Weighty,
Instructive, and Serious, or to be much Credited in what
they say. So that they of the middle <hi>Size</hi> of Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
Parts, and Wit, are generally those from whom God
receiveth most Service, and the Universality of Men most
Advantage. Neither will our Holy Lord accept that
Mans Labours, who is full of himself, and that makes his
own Applause and Commendation his ultimate End, and
terminating <hi>Center.</hi> But I do suppose Mr. <hi>Alsop</hi> is by this
time Rectified in his thoughts about Mr. <hi>Lobbs</hi> Intellectual
Abilities; and that he is made sufficiently Sensible by that
Authors <hi>Two</hi> last Books, that the <hi>Censure</hi> which he bestow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
on him in reference to weakness of Understanding,
should have been levelled at Home and not Abroad. The
occasion of the mistake being no ways in the Object, but
in the <hi>Optick Nerves</hi> and Various Humours of his own Eyes,
that could not discern what was plainly visible before him,
either in it's just Dimensions, or in it's true Colours. Nor
will it be otherwise, while <hi>Pedants</hi> assume an Authority of
Judging concerning True and Solid <hi>Learning;</hi> and while
<hi>Buffoons</hi> do claim a Right of deciding what is Just and
Accurate Wit: And while one perfectly <hi>Lunatick</hi> shall
Usurp the priviledge of Pronouncing who ought to be in
or out of <hi>Bedlam.</hi> But Mr. <hi>Lobb</hi> hath this to Comfort
himself under the forementioned Imputation, that it is
no disgrace to be called <hi>Fool</hi> by a <hi>Madman,</hi> nor to be Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
Weak and Unlearned by a little <hi>Pedant,</hi> whose great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Attainment is to Act the Part of <hi>Sancho Pancho</hi> by Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting
those with his <hi>Puns, Quibbles,</hi> and <hi>Jests,</hi> that
have no more Sense nor better Relish, than to attend at
his <hi>Stage;</hi> so there are divers Persons who with Respect
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:62502:55"/>
both to their Natural and Acquired Accomplishments, are
Qualified to Teach Mr. <hi>Alsop</hi> what is Genteel Wit, Rheto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical
Elegance, Sound Morality, Orthodox Divinity, and
good Breeding. who do think Mr. <hi>Lobb</hi> both an Honest and
a Learned Man, as well as a Good and Upright Divine,
and that he hath in these Controversies written with Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desty,
Pertinence, Strength, and exact Conformity to the
Doctrine hitherto received in the Protestant Reformed
Churches. And that Mr. <hi>Alsop</hi> ought to receive back all
his Sarcasms, Jeers and Satyrs upon this Head, and apply
them to the Ignorant and Half-witted Man, <hi>Himself.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But Mr. <hi>Alsop</hi>'s <hi>Personal Reflections</hi> on Mr. <hi>Lobb</hi> (many of
which I do keep in Reserve against the next Conflict, and
have therefore omitted the particular mentioning of them
at this Time) are the less to be Resented, and ought the
more easily to be dispensed with, if not pardoned in course,
as Excesses to which both the moral Complexion and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
of his Mind, and the Power of his Disease and Malady,
do hurry and transport him; seeing he knew not how to
spare and give Quarter to his Reverend, Dear, and much
Valued Friend <hi>Mr. John How,</hi> but bestows upon him a
Cast, and yeilds him a Proof of his blackning and defam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Faculty, that is much more Satyrical, and a sharper
pointed Pasquinade, than any which his most Virulent Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice
could suck and extract matter for out of <hi>Mr. Lobb</hi>'s
Writings wherewith Personally to asperse him. Nor is it
unworthy of Observation (towards our attaining unto an
Exacter and Distincter Knowledge of the Qualities and
Talent of the man) how that immediately after that he
had been sprinkling him with Holy Water, adorning his
Temples with a Garland of Flowers, and giving him his
Pastoral Benediction; he in the very next words, and the
same Period, treats him worse than if he had been to have
Cursed and Anathematized him with Bell, Book and Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle.
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:62502:55"/>
And possibly he might think it but Congruous, that
having so many of the Old <hi>Pagan</hi> Qualities in him, though
a <hi>Christian Priest,</hi> he should imitate those of the Pontifical
Order among the Heathen, who used first to gild the
Horns of the Beast which they were to Sacrifice, and then
to cut his Throat, and offer him as a <hi>Victim.</hi> For <hi>Mr. Lobb</hi>
having in his <hi>Defence of the Report,</hi> p. 86, 87. charged <hi>Mr.
Alsop</hi> 
               <q>For having subscribed his Name to a Preface to <hi>Mr.
Flavel</hi>'s <hi>Blow at the Root,</hi> wherein it was declared, that
the Difference between Dr. <hi>Crisp</hi> and other good men,
seems to lye not so much in the things, which the one
or the other of them Believe, as about their Order and
Reference to one another: and that notwithstanding
what is more Controvertible in Dr. <hi>Crisp</hi>'s Writings, yet
they do reckon there are much more material things
wherein they cannot but agree, and would have come
much nearer each other even in these things, if they did
take some <hi>Words</hi> or <hi>Terms</hi> in the same sense.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Unto which Charge all that</hi> Mr. Alsop <hi>has thought fit to
reply in his</hi> Vindic. <hi>of the</hi> Faithful Reb. <hi>p. 35, 36. is,</hi> That
the Paper, (viz. <hi>the forementioned Preface)</hi> was drawn up
by a Learned and Able Hand, (i. e. <hi>Mr.</hi> John How) in whose
Judgment he presumed he might acquiesce; and if that Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend
and Learned Person shall think fit to move out of his
Retiredness, and appear concerned in this Affair, he will easily
justify it: and that he Judged that Paper capable of a fair
Vindication, and may be Justified by an Ingenious Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
<hi>(all which are but the Oyling of his</hi> Hone, <hi>in order
to the giving the sharper Edge to his Razor, as appears in
the following words, namely)</hi> That he is not well pleased
with Himself, that he had put his Hand to that, or any other
Trimming Paper. <hi>In which Reply of Mr.</hi> Alsop'<hi>s,</hi> as there
occur several things not to pass unremark'd, because they
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:62502:56"/>
serve to give a farther Representation both of his <hi>Intelle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuals</hi>
and <hi>Morals;</hi> so the last Passage, which carrieth in it
such a severe Personal Reflection against Mr. <hi>How,</hi> is that
whereof I intend to take some what more especial notice.</p>
            <p>And the first thing that offereth it self to every man's
View, that will but open his Eyes to observe it, is, That
<hi>Mr. Alsop</hi> is every man's <hi>Tool</hi> that can but attack him on
his vain side, and flatter him with the Glory of having
his Name recorded in the End of a <hi>Preface,</hi> in Conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
with so Eminent and Learned a Person's as Mr. <hi>How</hi>'s.
Seeing it plainly appears that he had never thought before
hand, either distinctly, or thoroughly of what he was do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
but suffered himself to be <hi>wheedled</hi> by Caress or Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity,
to be a <hi>Tool</hi> in subscribing what he had either
never Read, or not duly Considered. And as nothing can
be more Evident, than that he must have Trespassed in
what he did, either against the Rules of <hi>Prudence,</hi> or
<hi>Laws of Conscience;</hi> so it is indifferent to me, into which
of them he will resolve it, having had so many uncontrou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable
Evidences already before me, that he can be at one
time Fool, and at another Knave, as he finds the diversity
of <hi>Personating</hi> on the publick Stage, to be most agreeable
to the Humour he is then in, and most subservient to the
venting of his Rage and Wrarh, or to the giving Sport
and Diversion. And as to his saying, <hi>He is displeased
with Himself,</hi> for what he did in that matter, I do not judge
it any Concernment of mine to determine on what motives
he is so, nor to interess my self in the Quarel, by which
of his Humours and Passions he is to be Govern'd; and
therefore all I will say, is, That he never had before him a
more proper and demeriting Subject of just displeasure; and
that the Levelling the Artillery of his Indignation against
an Object so worthy of it, will more commend his Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:62502:56"/>
Sincerity and Justice, than all the Proofs he hath
hitherto given of his Angry and Rancorous Faculty. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
this late Testimony which he hath vouchsafed us, of
his not being past the Grace, nor the Bounds of Repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
may Administer some faint hopes unto us, that he
will in his next <hi>Lucida,</hi> humble himself to come forth in
a New Habit and Dress of Penitence, in order to make
Attonement for latter Offences, which I am sure do call
for larger measures of Contrition and Remorse. And
that we shall hear of his <hi>Apology,</hi> (which, to say the best
of it, is the Retreat of the Fool, and the After-game of
the Wise) <hi>that he has been Mr.</hi> Williams'<hi>s Tool;</hi> (it being
not only his Destiny, but the unavoidable Consequence of
his little Sense to be some body's) as we have now had it
for the having been Mr. <hi>How</hi>'s.</p>
            <p>To which I might subjoyn, in the <hi>Second</hi> Place, That
with whatsoever Reason or Justice Mr. <hi>Lobb</hi> and others
may complain of Dr. <hi>Crisp</hi> for his <hi>Antinomianism;</hi> yet
Mr. <hi>Alsop</hi> cannot with any Consistency to Himself, pursue
it with the Noise and Clamour, nor prosecute an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachment
of it with the Malice and Rage that he hath
begun. For if it be only, or chiefly, <hi>the taking some
Words and Phrases in different Senses,</hi> that keeps him and
others at a distance in Opinions, as the forementioned <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face</hi>
affirms, and which Mr. <hi>Alsop</hi> says is capable of <hi>a fair
Vindication,</hi> and may be justified by an Ingenious Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation;
I do then challenge all mankind, who have
their Senses about them, and continue Masters of their
Reason, to give a Wise, Rational, or Pertinent Account
of the Satyrical and Bitter Invectives of Mr. <hi>Alsop,</hi> as
well as of Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> against <hi>Crispianism,</hi> and so many
of those of the <hi>Congregational</hi> way <hi>as</hi> Favourers of it. As
that, <hi>Some of the Biggest Name among them, from the Press
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:62502:57"/>
and Pulpit, had disseminated such horrid Opinions as filled all
Intelligent Persons with Astonishment and Indignation.</hi> P. 25.
of his <hi>Faithful Rebuke to a False Rep.</hi> And that Mr. <hi>Lobb,
through being n Favourer of Dr.</hi> Crisp's <hi>Notions, has left
out of his Substance of the Gospel, Regeueration, Conversion,
Repentance, Holiness, Sanctification, a New Heart, New
Obedience, and good Works,</hi> &amp;c. P. 29. of the <hi>Vindic, of
the Faithful Rebuke,</hi> compared with p. 4.</p>
            <p>And that they who have used the Phrase of Christ's su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staining
the Person of the Elect upon the Cross, never
dream'd of <hi>Crisp</hi>'s Substance of the Gospel, where Faith
is left out from any Concern in Justification; and that
as the Atheist's Heaven has no God in it; the <hi>Socinians</hi>
Hell has no Devil in it; so the <hi>Antinomian</hi>'s Gospel has
no Justifying Faith in it; with an Hundred Expressions
more of the same Alloy, which I have not leisure at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
and therefore forbear to repeat. Now if any man
preserv'd so far in his Wits, as to know that Four and
Three make Seven, and that Six is an Equal Number, and
Nine an Unequal, can Reconcile these passages of <hi>Mr.
Alsop,</hi> wherein he accuseth <hi>Dr. Crisp</hi> with those in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned
<hi>Preface,</hi> and in the now repeated <hi>Apology</hi> of our
<hi>Author</hi> for it, I will be bold to Affirm that he may with
the same Ease both bring the Northern and Southern <hi>Poles</hi>
into Conjunction, and make those propositions Identical
and Coincident, which are directly Contradictory. By
which it is Apparent that Mr. <hi>Alsop</hi> neither writes upon
Principles of Science or of Faith, but in the Virtue of the
Warmth, or of the Chilness of his Blood, and as his pulse beats
faster or Slower, and as he is out of his <hi>Paroxisms</hi> or under
them. And that we are to gather and Conclude what his
opinions are, from the Seasons of the Moon, and the Estival
or Brumal Temper of the Air, and not from any Coherent
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:62502:57"/>
               <hi>Schemes,</hi> which by means either of Philosophy or Revelation,
he hath Formed of the Doctrines of Faith, and Precepts of
of manners.</p>
            <p>But that which upon this Occasion, I have Reserved to
be the last, is the Title and Character, which this Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
Bestower of <hi>Marks</hi> and <hi>Badges</hi> of <hi>Dignity,</hi> hath
Conferr'd upon Mr. <hi>How,</hi> of being a <hi>Trimmer.</hi> Which,
according to the design of those who first Coyned and
Minted the <hi>Term,</hi> signifies no more than an <hi>Hypocrite</hi> and
a <hi>Dissembler.</hi> And one who guides himself by no other
Principles either in his Political or Moral <hi>Conduct,</hi> save by
those of Worldly safety and of Secular Interest. For tho
Sir. <hi>William Coventry</hi> in his Ingenious <hi>Character of a Trim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,</hi>
gives a nobler Representation of those that are so
Denominated, (of whom I do believe his Account to be
very just in reference to very many that have been and
are so Stiled) yet nothing can be more certain than that
the <hi>Original Authors</hi> and <hi>Fabrickers</hi> of the <hi>Word,</hi> designed
to Discribe, Discypher, and Mark out those by it, who
were neither Loyal Subjects, Upright Christians, Just,
Veracious and Amicable Neighbours, nor Vigorous Patrons
and Partizans of Publick Laws and Liberties. And as it
is Evident from the manner of Mr. <hi>Alsop</hi>'s applying it, and
the end whereunto that he intended it in the worst Sense
(because the being a <hi>Trimmer,</hi> according to Sir <hi>William Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventry</hi>'s
Paraphrase of the <hi>Term,</hi> would be any Man's Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
and not his Reproach, and ought to be coveted and not
avoided) so both Mr. <hi>How</hi> and Mr. <hi>Alsop,</hi> do owe that
Respect and Deference to their <hi>Whig</hi> and <hi>Phanatick</hi> Friends,
who were the first Inventers of the Word, as so acquiesce
in the <hi>Signification</hi> which they Stampt upon it. And ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the <hi>Value</hi> which those People design'd it should
be Current at, it is no more nor less than the <hi>Euqivalent</hi> of
Rogue and Rascal; the latter being only of Coarser <hi>Metal,</hi>
               <pb n="108" facs="tcp:62502:58"/>
but the same in <hi>Exchange,</hi> and on the <hi>Ballance</hi> of <hi>Traffick</hi>
in the mutual Communication of Thoughts, with the
former. Which therefore to bestow upon Mr. <hi>How,</hi> must
be very unmannerly, rude, and injurious in Mr. <hi>Alsop;</hi>
unless he have more Acquaintance with that Gentleman'<hi>s
Political</hi> and <hi>Moral</hi> Principles and Practices, than I, who
do not pretend to the Honour of Conversing with him,
could have imagined that he was embued with. But on
supposition, that Mr. <hi>Alsop</hi> is not altogether mistaken in
his Idea of that <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Divine; yet there were other
ways of <hi>Penance,</hi> which might have been Prescribed unto
him, for the having Written the Forementioned <hi>Preface,</hi>
than to be thus brought forth as a <hi>Knave</hi> in the View of
the World, in <hi>Castigation</hi> and <hi>Punishment</hi> of that Offence.
For, if I be not very much misinformed, Mr. <hi>How</hi> is no less
ready to make Attonement for Crimes of this kind, than
he is Inclinable to Commit them. And Mr. <hi>Alsop</hi> might
have found other Kinds and Degrees of <hi>Ecclesiastical</hi> Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline
to have adjudged him unto, than to Transmit him
down to Posterity to stand Registred in the <hi>Dypticks</hi> of the
<hi>Church</hi> by the <hi>Name</hi> and <hi>Character</hi> of a <hi>Trimmer;</hi> which I
Believe, as well as Fear, will give a very odd <hi>Figure</hi> of
a <hi>Divine,</hi> and especially of one of his Eminency.</p>
            <p>But the next Personal <hi>Reflection</hi> for which I am to call
Mr. <hi>Alsop</hi> to an Account, is that which he hath ventured,
without the least Provocation given, against a Learned and
Holy <hi>Divine,</hi> and one who is a very useful and Successful
Preacher of the <hi>Gospel,</hi> and as well equal both to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
and to himself in whatsoever deserves Esteem and
Commendation, as Superior to them in Uprightness and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity.
The Person I mean, is the Reverend Mr. <hi>Daniel
Burgess,</hi> to whom tho I be altogether a Stranger, yet I do
so well know his <hi>Worth</hi> and <hi>Merit,</hi> that I do hold my self
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:62502:58"/>
in Duty and Justice obliged to do him Right. Nor has
it been without Surprize and Astonishment, that I have
found Mr. <hi>Alsop</hi>'s <hi>Picquancy</hi> and <hi>Satyrism</hi> to lye <hi>chiefly</hi>
against those both of his own Order, and of the Rank of
<hi>Dissenters.</hi> As if at the same time, that both all the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
he hath attained unto, and the Plentiful, if not
<hi>Opulent,</hi> Condition unto which he is raised, is through his
being <hi>accounted</hi> a <hi>Minister</hi> of the <hi>Gospel,</hi> and a <hi>Nonconfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mist
Preacher,</hi> his <hi>Wrath</hi> and <hi>Malice</hi> were Particularly Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vesled
against those of the <hi>Ecclesiastick Tribe,</hi> and <hi>Pastoral
Character,</hi> and especially against them of that Quality
amongst the <hi>Dissenters.</hi> And whereas, as great and Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
a Person as either the <hi>Nation,</hi> or the <hi>Churches</hi> of any
Denomination in <hi>England,</hi> can boast of, thought him long
ago Worthy of the Title (and accordingly bestowed on
him) of <hi>Martin Mar-Prelate,</hi> he may through the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements
which he hath made since, in the Perfections
which procured him that Honourable Name, have his
Stile now Enlarged and be called the <hi>Marphorio</hi> and <hi>Pasquin</hi>
upon the whole <hi>Sacerdotal Order,</hi> and the <hi>Satyrical Reviler</hi>
of them of the <hi>Ministerial Function.</hi> Nor would it exceed
the Bounds and Rules of a reasonable Jealousie, to suspect
that his <hi>Buffooneries</hi> and <hi>Invectives</hi> against so many of them,
is not so much from any Quarrel he has with their Persons,
as from a Prejudice he bears against their Office, and from
Latent ill will to their Lord and Master, whose Ambassadors
they are. And this Apprehension would seem the more
Justifiable, in that those of them whom he <hi>chiefly</hi> singleth
out to <hi>Ridicule</hi> and <hi>Lampoon,</hi> are such who do not only
appear Adorned more Distinguishingly than others,
with those Accomplishments and Vertues required in
Bishops and Pastors, but whose Labours God doth most
signally Bless in the Conversion of Sinners, and in the Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
up of Believers.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="110" facs="tcp:62502:59"/>
'Tis true, that neither the Sacred Character which
they bear, nor the Renewing and Sanctifying Grace of
God, do so far Elevate them above the Rank of other men,
but that they will have some Humane Weaknesses and
Imperfections cleaving unto and accompanying them;
which nevertheless ought not only to have some Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
showed them on the Foot of the Common and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoidable
Frailties of our Nature, but in deference to
their Office, and out of Respect to him whose Servants
they peculiarly are. And where their Faults are not E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>normous,
nor the Effects of Insincerity, their Reputation
should be held as Sacred as their Office and Character are.
Nor can a Clergy-man be Exposed or made Cheap, without
both the designing and the doing more consequential Hurt
to the Souls of men, who would otherwise attend upon,
and might receive benefit by their Ministry; and the
affording more Ground to the Prophane of Contempt,
as well as a Neglect of those Ordinances, which Christ
hath appointed them to be the Dispensers of; than the
Injury done immediately to themselves can amount unto,
or the Diversion and Pleasure of doing it can any ways
Excuse. Yea, in all Cases where the Faults of Ministers
are not palpably Notorious as well as Gross, and where
the <hi>Pastor</hi> doth not by his <hi>Buffoonry</hi> both <hi>disgrace</hi> and
<hi>renounce</hi> his <hi>Character,</hi> and lay aside the Parson as soon as
he comes out of the Pulpit, to put on and act the <hi>Droll</hi>
and <hi>Merry Andrew;</hi> it is an Indispensible Duty in all that
would shew themselves either Virtuous or well-bred, to
cover and conceal them as much as may be: And the Tres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passing
on the other hand, by detecting and publishing of
them, where there is no need for, or publick advantage
arising by it, is very Heinously Criminal at the Tribunal
above, whatever it be reckoned at your Benches of Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cature
here below.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="111" facs="tcp:62502:59"/>
And to represent a <hi>Minister</hi> as a <hi>Fool,</hi> to be made a <hi>Jest</hi>
of (while he doth not abandon and disclaim the Sacred Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
through an Affectation of Appearing and being <hi>a
Jack-Pudding)</hi> discovereth both Malice against the Office,
and is more calculated to bring Dishonour upon our <hi>Lord
Jesus Christ,</hi> than to tell of Twenty Failures, or Excesses,
to which they are Incident with other men; and from which
neither their Character, nor the Measures of Grace which
God thinks fit to Communicate to any degrees of Men in
this Life, can wholly preserve and secure them. And of
all things the <hi>Sallies</hi> of <hi>Wit,</hi> and sometimes the indiscreet
and impertinent <hi>Excursions</hi> of a <hi>Luxuriant Fancy,</hi> are not
only the most Pardonable, but ought to be least taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of. Our <hi>Imaginations</hi> not being so intirely under the
Conduct and Command of our Reasons, as our other Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
and Faculties are. Yea, our very Passions are more in
subjection to the Dominion, Restraint and Curb of our
Minds, than the sudden and unforeseen Starts, Eruptions
and Bounces of an impregnated and warm Fancy, are
found to be. Yea, such is sometimes the Misfortune of
those who are Endowed with the vastest degrees of Preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancy
of Fancy, that they lose more of their Credit in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thought and held Wise Men, by the venting of One Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent
and Foppish thing, than a long Course of Reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
and Prudent Conduct will again restore them unto. So
far is that Apothegm from being Exactly and Universally
true, <hi>that he who is wise all day, can never be a Fool at night;</hi>
that for a person, whom the greatest part of his Life hath
shewed to be really modest, discreet and wise, to be but
Guilty of One signal Impertinence and Blunder, may be
such a <hi>Blot</hi> in his <hi>Scutcheon,</hi> as nothing can ever rase out or
wash off.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="112" facs="tcp:62502:60"/>
Nor would I in these Sheets have with so much <hi>Picquancy</hi>
taken notice of Mr. <hi>Alsop</hi>'s Claim unto, and pretended Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
of <hi>Wit,</hi> but that it is all of that kind which both flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
from a want of true Judgment, and of accurate Sense,
and is the Result of the deliberate Choice of a depraved
Will. For though not only the hastly overflowing of a Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile
and Rich Fancy, which are for the most part immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
retracted after their precipitant Ebullitions, but the <hi>motus
primo primi</hi> of our Wills, while not afterwards consented to
and approved of, ought to be construed for easily pardona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
if not held <hi>Venial</hi> among men towards one another
(though they be Expressive of the Corruption of our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
and have the Taint of Pravity as well as of Guilt
upon them) yet studied and affected Lightnesses, Jeers and
Sarcasms, are to be accounted both gross Immoralities and
prodigious Follies, and to be accordingly rebuked and repri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded.
However, as to my self I do esteem it an happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and do heartily bless God for it, that I am not furnish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with a Faculty pregnant with little Airy Conceits, but
that I have my Thoughts under the Antecedent Government,
as well as under the posterior Examination and Censure of my
Reason. But having on the Occasion of a <hi>Personal Reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
on Mr. <hi>Daniel Burgess,</hi> taken the Liberty to offer those few
things to the Consideration of mankind, which I have now
delivered, in order to their improvement in a Reserved, Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet,
and Modest Conduct; I shall now more particularly
consider the Rude, Unmannerly, and Barbarous <hi>Reflection</hi> it
self, and shew, that as there was no just Provocation given
to Mr. <hi>Alsop</hi> for the publishing such a thing if it had been
true, so there was not the least Ground for raising such a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port,
but that it was all malicious Fiction, and a Romantick.
Story invented by the Atheistical and Prophane. The Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
of publishing the Story was this, namely, That Mr.
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:62502:60"/>
               <hi>Alsop</hi> having said, p. 29. of his <hi>Faithful Reb. to a False
Rep.</hi> 
               <q>That the Nine Brethren, who for, and in hopes of
Peace, had signed the former Paper, had their Hands,
Heads, and Hearts too, in the forming, wording, and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting
to the Third.</q> Whereunto Mr. <hi>Lobb</hi> return'd, in
way of Answer, p. 70. of his <hi>Def<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of the Rep.</hi> 
               <q>That se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
of the Nine had very lately declared their Approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the first Paper, and one of them in particular
had told him, That Mr. <hi>Alsop</hi> was guilty of a Notorious
Falshood, in saying, That the Individual Nine had their
Hands, their Heads, and their Hearts, in the forming
wording, and assenting to the Third Paper; for he had
neither Hand, Head, nor Heart in it.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Now it was meerly upon this, and upon no Offence com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
that Mr.</hi> Alsop <hi>replies, p. 140. of his</hi> Vindic. of the
Faithful Reb. That if any one of the Reverend Nine-Pins has
been Tipt down, and denied his Agreement to the Third Paper;
'tis more than he had done before his Brethren: Nor is he at all
concerned; for as he dare not <hi>(says he)</hi> Pin his Faith upon his
Sleeve, so neither will he hang upon his Cloak, lest he should un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>button
the Loop, and let him drop into the bottomless Pit, as
'tis said he threatned some of his Auditors; and that if he
has that slippery Trick with him, he would neither be in his
Cloaths, nor hang on his Cloak, for a Groat.</p>
            <p>But having already taken notice of the Impiousness, as
well as of the Buffoonry of these Passages, all I shall do
now, shall be only to Animadvert upon the Fabulousness
and Falseness of the Story, upon which Mr, <hi>Alsop</hi> has had
the Insolence to Reflect and Droll on a Minister of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel.
For that which makes the Defamation the more bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous
in it self, and the more inhumane towards a Friend,
as well as sacrilegious, in reference to one that is a Divine;
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:62502:61"/>
is it's being founded upon a Fiction and a Lye, and of
which Mr. <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lsop</hi> could pretend to no Intelligence, save by
some vain and Foolish Report. For all that he pretends to
superstruct this detractive Reflection upon, is, <hi>it's having
been said that he threatned some of his Auditors so;</hi> which
was too slender and sandy a Foundation upon which to make
a Reverend Brother, and a Faithful Ambassador of Jesus
Christ, the Subject of Impious and wanton Sport. For
knowing how prone the Atheistical and Prophane are to
invent Stories, whereby to render those of the Pastoral
Order Ridiculous, he ought neither by the Rules of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
nor of good manners, to have given the least Ear
to it, and much less to have dared to publish it, without
the highest degrees of Moral Certainty, as to the Truth of
it. And if all the idle and defamatory Stories, invented by
the Graceless Rabble, and Impious Wits, against Ministers
of the Gospel, should with the like Licentiousness be spread
and divulged by one of their own Order, and the Word and
Authority of a <hi>Priest</hi> laid to Pledge in Justification of them,
I will be bold to say, That there are few Divines in and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
<hi>London,</hi> but who would as justly stand Obnoxious to be
called Knaves and Villains, as Mr. <hi>Burgess,</hi> by reason of the
fore-mentioned Expression, is Exposed to be made a <hi>Jest</hi> of.
And he that hath been so Liberal in bestowing the Charact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of <hi>Lying and Slandering Tongue</hi> again and again upon Mr.
<hi>Lobb</hi> (only for representing him modestly and truly) and of
Affirming, <hi>That the Elegant Figure with which he hath embel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish'd
his whole Discourse of the Defence of the Report, is purus,
putus, satanismus. Vid. p. 25. ubi supra;</hi> should not have
been so forward in receiving and publishing Falsehoods of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
unless he takes his own Province to be incroached
upon, and is offended that any should believe or disperse
Falsehoods besides himself, or that they should presume to
rob him of <hi>Purus, Putus, Satanismus,</hi> being a Rhetorick he
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:62502:61"/>
is admirably versed in. And upon whose peculiar Right
and Title thereunto, as Mr. <hi>Lobb</hi> hath not hitherto broken
in, by any thing that he hath written of Him; so I dare
say, that he will neither divest Him of that Priviledge
hereafter (wherein it would seem He claims a <hi>Monopoly)</hi>
nor envy His single and quiet Possession of it. For as he
has both Chalk'd out for Himself an Imployment, and
given a Proof of his Qualifiedness for the discharge of it,
which no man hath been heretofore so impudently Villain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
as to venture upon, namely, of being the Publisher as
well as the Licenser of all the Lyes, which any have the
Vanity or Malice to bring unto him; so I doubt not but
he would have had the Pride to think he should have
Authenticated, and made them Current, by affixing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
them the Name and Seal of <hi>Vincent Alsop, Presbyteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi>
Preacher in <hi>Westminster;</hi> were it not that I have
possibly blasted his Credit. And he being both the late
Inventor, and admirably skilled in the using this Engine
of Slander and Defamation, whereby the most Establish't
Reputation of the Wisest and Best Men, is Blown up,
without their having Means left them of preventing, or
of countermining it; it is a pity but that either by <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,</hi>
or by <hi>Statute</hi> he should, during his Natural Life,
have the whole Benefit that accrueth by it; and that he
may with all, have a <hi>Badg</hi> appointed Him; by the wear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
whereof, and by some Engravement over his Door,
importing his Office and Character, all people may know
where the <hi>Divulger of Lyes</hi> dwells; and who is allotted
to be Chief Agent in the Traffick of Falshood. To which,
in manners, I ought to subjoyn, That I wish him Joy
in his Office, and that all the Success may Attend him
which he deserves, namely, that none may hereafter
Credit him out of the Pulpit, whatever they may do in
it. For certainly that Person knew the Diversity of his
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:62502:62"/>
               <hi>lents,</hi> who said she never cared to see Him, or to hear
Him, but in and from the fore-mentioned Place.</p>
            <p>Nor could I have guessed upon what Motive he has
Printed so False, Impudent, and Disgraceful a Story, but
that he hath let me into the Reason, Mystery and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
of it, by a Key of his own <hi>Fabricking,</hi> p. 103. of
the <hi>Vindication of his Faithful Reb<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> where pretending to
give an Account of the Opposition made to Mr. <hi>Willi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ams</hi>'s
<hi>Arminian</hi> and <hi>Socinianizing</hi> Notions, he resolves
it into this, namely, <hi>That if God hath given him an Vse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
and Profitable way of Preaching the Gospel, he may be
maligned on that account. If he hath made too great a Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure
in the World, and born too great a port, that might
draw on him the Evil Eye,</hi> &amp;c. Which by changing the
Tables, and inverting the Prospect to the 'tother End,
gives us a True Ground of Mr. <hi>Alsop</hi>'s Wrath against
Mr. <hi>Burgess,</hi> and of his defaming him after the Inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane,
as well as Unchristian manner that he hath done.
For finding Himself <hi>Eclipsed</hi> in <hi>the Vain Glory</hi> which he
Aims at by his Preaching, (instead of his designing and
pursuing the Honour of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the
Benefit of the Souls of Men) through the great and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
Esteem which Persons of the first Rank, Qnali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and Sense, as well as others of all Conditions, have of
Mr. <hi>Burgess</hi>'s Sound and Edifying Ministry, the Vain, Sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fish,
and Haughty Man is hereupon exasperated, and
from thence cares not of what disservice it may be to our
Blessed Lord, nor of what prejudice it may prove to the
Souls of Men, provided He may but depress Mr. <hi>Burgess</hi>
in the Veneration, Reverence and Love that are paid him,
and by turning Him into a Jest, get others both to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spise
and abandon Attendance on his Preaching.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="117" facs="tcp:62502:62"/>
But though this appears to be the <hi>Grand</hi> Inducement
upon which he hath treated him after the foregoing man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
yet I doubt not of his finding Himself by this time
wonderfully disappointed in <hi>the End</hi> which He had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed,
and that <hi>the Mine</hi> which He had laid for the Blow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
up the Reputation of a Reverend Divine, hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted,
and sprung against Himself, and shattered his
own, and that instead of Diminishing Mr. <hi>Burgess</hi>'s Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit,
or lessening his Assembly in the least, he hath both
strangely disgusted the Soberest of his own Auditors, and
sunk his Esteem amongst them, both as an Honest Man,
and a Minister of the Gospel, beyond the possibility, as
well as the likelihood of his Recovering and Repairing
it.</p>
            <p>There remains yet one <hi>Personal Reflection</hi> more of Mr.
<hi>Alsop</hi>'s, for which I ought both in Reason and Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to give him <hi>Chastisement.</hi> But it being so heinously
Immoral, as well as Indecent, that it is in a manner be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
the Pen. I am afraid to call him to account, lest I
should be Transported to use <hi>the Ferula</hi> with too much
Rigour, and thereupon maim, or wound, when my only
design is gently to Correct him. For as if it were not a
thing shameful, and Criminal in Mr. <hi>Alsop,</hi> to have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack'd
and fullyed the Reputation of the <hi>Living,</hi> he hath
<hi>Tygerously</hi> fallen upon the Dead, and Endeavoured to
Blacken their <hi>Memory.</hi> And as if that Old Brutal <hi>Pagan</hi>
were Revived in Him, whose Loathsome Character it is
in History, to have said, <hi>That nothing smelled so sweet as
the stench of a Dead Enemy;</hi> He seems to have his
mind delighted, his Spirits Exhilerated, and all his Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
gratified by his viewing the <hi>Corps,</hi> fixing his Eye up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and holding his Nose over the Ashes of Two Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:62502:63"/>
and Holy Divines, lately deceased; and instead of
suffering them to rest in their Graves Embalm'd in the
sweet Odours, that excellent Learning, severe Piety, use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Preaching, and all the Flowers of Exemplary Virtue
that grow in, and are to be gathered either out of the Fields
of Morality, or from the Enclosed and Cultivated Garden of
the Gospel, are adapted to give a sweet and pleasant scent
of to such as view their Tombs, and Reflect upon and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine
their Lives; he hath without License or Authority,
carried them into his <hi>Anatomy-Office,</hi> and hath there not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
dissected them, and defaced their shapes by Tearing
them Limb from Limb, and stript them of all that was
Amiable and Odoriferous about them, but hath wrapt
them in Filth and Nastiness, and then hung them up in
<hi>Effigie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now it having been the Wisdom and Care of every Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that hath been any ways Civilized, to provide by
Laws against all Injuries, which the Brutal part of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
might perpetrate towards the Dead; and it having
pass'd into a Proverb universally received, <hi>That we should
tread softly upon their Graves,</hi> yea, it being the Interest of
the Living (through a Consulting what may be their own
Case) to Revenge the Wrongs done to the Memories of
the Deceased; I shall therefore take a little notice of this
Inhumanity of Mr. <hi>Alsop</hi> towards Two lately departed
Divines. And but a little, lest through Resentment of the
Injury done to them, I should be hurried into Excesses a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
Mr. <hi>Alsop,</hi> which I would not willingly be Guilty
of. <hi>I Rejoyce</hi> (saith he) <hi>heartily, that we have at length
heard some Tydings of Faith and Repentance, in order to
our discharge from Punishment, which were wholly lost in the
Report: so much do we owe to the Seasonable Deaths of Two
Antinomians, under whose Influence he then was, and to the
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:62502:63"/>
Lives of two Sound Divines, under whose Awe he now is,</hi>
p. 143. of the <hi>Vindication of the Faithful Reb.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In reference to which Passages I shall, with all the Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity
I can, observe Three Things.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> That the Expression of, <hi>The Seasonable Deaths of
Mr.</hi> Cole <hi>and Mr.</hi> Mather, is Brutal and Barbarous, as
well as Immoral and Unchristian. And that it argueth a
strange Malignancy of Temper, and a Secret Enmity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Glory of God, and the good of Souls, to be thus
in his Exaltations of Mirth, for the Death of Two Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Labourers in the Work of the Lord, and in the saving
of Souls; while all of true Piety or Good Judgment, who
knew them, were afflictedly bewailing their Loss, as a
Wonderful Damage to the Church of God; and which
nothing could have brought them to a submissive and qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et
Acquiescence in, but the Consideration of the Will of
the Great Sovereign, who giveth no account of his mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
besides his pleasure, and a steddy Faith, that there is
with him the Residue of the Spirit, whereby to qualifie o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
to replenish and fill their Posts. And whosoever he
be that doth thus Exalt and Triumph over the Deaths of
Two Eminently Virtuous, Pious, and Useful Persons, and
that Envieth both us and them the <hi>Elegies</hi> which are made
upon them, I will presume to say of him, That as he can
never hope to dye the Death of the Righteous, nor to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
the Burial of a Man; so all he can expect, is to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
under the Infamy (if he Escape the Horror) of the
Wicked, and to have his Resemblance perpetuated by such
an <hi>Epitaph</hi> as would be written upon a <hi>Tyger</hi> or a <hi>Bear.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Second</hi> Thing which I would observe in reference to
the foregoing Citation, is his styling them <hi>Known Antino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mians,</hi>
               <pb n="120" facs="tcp:62502:64"/>
which is a Falshood that Thousands can controul,
and prove the Contradictory of. For though upon more
Experience of <hi>the Law of the Spirit of Life,</hi> and greater
inward Sensations of the <hi>Power of the Divine Life,</hi> than
God is pleased to Priviledge and Honour People of Mr. <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sop</hi>'s
Wanton Wit, and Hanghty Petulant Humour with,
they might think some Terms which others stake them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
down unto, to be too scanty, narrow and flat by
which to express their own Feelings, and the Concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
which they had thereupon; yet they were as far
from being <hi>Antinomians,</hi> as they were from being either
<hi>Socinians</hi> or <hi>Arminians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor is it unworthy of Remark, That men of the best
Hearts, and the Closest Communion with God, have not
usually the most distinct and perspicuous methods of clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
and delivering their Notions. And the Reason is
obvious, in that while others form both their Divinity
<hi>Schemes,</hi> and Hunt for Language wherein to Array them,
from <hi>the Theologick Chairs,</hi> and <hi>the Rhetorical</hi> Desks; bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowing
their Tenets from the <hi>Systematick Doctors,</hi> and
their Phrases from <hi>the Masters of Oratory,</hi> the former do
in Consistency with, and in Subordination to Scriptural
Revelation, Form divers of <hi>their Theological Notions</hi> from,
and by their Internal Feelings. And though they may
thereupon sometimes differ from such as have only read
and meditated, but have never <hi>felt;</hi> yet when they
come to be ask'd and advised with concerning what they
mean, their Opinions are found in Effect to be the same
with theirs who accuse and Reproach them, only they
have an <hi>Air</hi> and <hi>Meen</hi> of Spirituality, which their Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries
do deride, through want of Enlightned, Elevated,
and Qualified Faculties, whereby to discern these Beauties.
Nor will I deny them to have been less fond of the <hi>Vnion,</hi>
than several of their Brethren were, yet it was not from
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:62502:64"/>
any Picque against <hi>Presbyterians</hi> in general, and much less
from an universal dislike of their Principles, as if they were
such as made them unmeet upon any Terms to be Cement<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and Sodered with; but it was out of a Jealousy that there
were some among them of the Spirit of <hi>Diotrephes,</hi> and of
the Temper of <hi>Demas,</hi> who would thro' the Union endeav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
to usurp a Jurisdiction over all the Brethren, and who
would serve their own Ends, and those of a Faction, upon,
and by means of the Common Agreement. And I do wish
that their previous Apprehensions and Fears had not been
both justified and confirmed by too many Overt-Acts and
sensible Proofs since.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Third</hi> Thing that I would Animadvert upon, is Mr.
<hi>Lobb</hi>'s <hi>having been under the Awe of those Two Reverend Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons;</hi>
whereas I can boldly affirm, That the contrary is ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
known to all that are acquainted with him, or who
have had Experience of his Uprightness and Integrity. For
tho he be none of your huffing bouncing people, yet he is of
that Manly and Christian Fortitude, as not to suffer his
Understanding and Faith to be prescribed unto by any,
save by the Supreme Veracious Being. But it is one of
Mr. <hi>Alsop</hi>'s Creeping and Sneaking Artifices, <hi>to draw other
Mens Pictures by his own Original,</hi> and from his being a little
pitiful <hi>Tool</hi> himself, to conclude that others are also so. And
that because he is under the Government of no Principles,
unless of Pride, Passion and Vanity, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to believe the
same of those who have an Uprightness to let nothing sway
them, besides the <hi>Dictamina</hi> of Conscience, founded upon and
guided by Revelation and Reason.</p>
            <p>And thus I have at last finished my Examen of Mr. <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sop</hi>'s
way of writing; and though in some places it be
done with some measure of Smartness, through a concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:62502:65"/>
for the Truths of God, the Reputation of good men,
and for preserving the Churches from being infected with
Errors, and the being depraved by Vicious and Corrupt Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples;
yet it hath been done with the manners of a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman,
if not with the Learning of a Scholar: most of
the Salt and Pepper, as well as of Vinegar, which it would
have born, being reserv'd till the next Rancounter with
Mr. <hi>Alsop,</hi> if he do think it for his Advantage to throw
himself in my way again, armed with <hi>Porcupine Quills, Hog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gish
Bristles,</hi> or with <hi>Don Quixot</hi>'s <hi>Sword, Lance and Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met.</hi>
For I am resolved to put an End to Mr. <hi>Alsop</hi>'s way
of writing, and to banish it, as to <hi>Ministers,</hi> out of the
Precincts of the Nation, as well as out of the <hi>Purlieus</hi>
of Churches, or else to finish my Days in the Underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
and Atchievement. And which considering my
Years, as well as my Health and Vigour, may not, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Course of Nature, fall out before his,
whose Dotage, and his being already twice a Child, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claims
him superannuated. Only one Admonition I do
here think fit to give, That all concerned may be upon their
Guard, namely, That the Gentlemen who write for the
<hi>Theatre</hi> and <hi>Stage,</hi> finding themselves attack'd upon the
Score of their Prophaneness, and their turning Religion in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>Ridicule,</hi> are thinking of making <hi>Reprizals</hi> upon those
of the <hi>Clergy;</hi> which if they should be so ill-natur'd and
revengeful as to do, Mr. <hi>Alsop,</hi> the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Preacher,
will be found to have out-done the most Libertine and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centious
among the <hi>Poets,</hi> in all that is Unmannerly,
Rude, Clownish, detractive and Impious. And his ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<hi>Interlop'd</hi> upon them in their Trade, Faculty and
Talent, may so Justly provoke them, that I shall no ways
wonder, if they seize upon his <hi>Cargo,</hi> and expose it to Sale
at their <hi>Auction-Houses,</hi> in <hi>Lincolns-Inn-Fields</hi> and <hi>Covent-Garden,</hi>
to whosoever will bid most for it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="123" facs="tcp:62502:65"/>
For if we may take a measure of the Lightness, Buf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foonry,
Petulancy, and Prophaneness of those of the
<hi>Ecclesiastical Order,</hi> by the <hi>Presbyterian Preacher</hi> at <hi>West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minster;</hi>
the <hi>Pulpit</hi> is equally, if not more scandalous
than the <hi>Stage,</hi> and they who are <hi>Called</hi> Preachers of the
Gospel, and are <hi>dub'd</hi> for Theological Authors, do as much
need to be reformed, as they who do write <hi>Comedies</hi> and
<hi>Tragedies</hi> for the <hi>Theatre.</hi> Only the Crime is much
more heinous in the <hi>Former</hi> than in the <hi>Latter,</hi> both
because of their different Characters, and of the Respe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive
Ends which they are severally supposed to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign.</p>
            <p>And truely tho' my <hi>Talent</hi> doth not lye that way, yet
if my <hi>Morals</hi> would have Allowed me, I thought to
have made an <hi>Essay</hi> in reducing Mr. <hi>Alsops</hi> Writings in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a <hi>Farce</hi> (that being the whole of what is Rellishing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
divertive, which they are capable of being form'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to)
and to have made him and Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
Actors, and to have Introduced some of the young
unthinking Preachers about the Town, to have <hi>Clapt</hi> at
whatsoever their Wit and Manners would have found an
agreableness in, or at least to have danced to an <hi>Horn
Pipe</hi> and a <hi>Jews Trump</hi> in the <hi>Interludes.</hi> But I do sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
the prescribing and administring of that <hi>Hellebore,</hi>
till I see how Gentler Physick will work with them:
Which tho' a little Bitter, is not only made palatable but
dulcified, by means of the vehicle into which it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused
and mixed. So that all which I have to add is to
you, <hi>Reverend Pastors and Brethren of the Congregational
perswasion,</hi> In order to beg your Forgiveness, for Intitling
you to a <hi>Trifle,</hi> so much below you merit and worth:
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:62502:66"/>
It having been my Ambition, to have testified the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference,
which I pay you, by something that might
have been more valuable, if the Subject, so far as my
Concernment lyes in it, would have admitted it.</p>
            <p>However, give me leave to say, and withal do me the
Justice to receive it as no Complement, that I am with
the profoundest respect and greatest sincerity,</p>
