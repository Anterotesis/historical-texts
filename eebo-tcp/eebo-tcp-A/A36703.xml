            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <l>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hile flattering crouds officiously appear</l>
            <l>To give themselves, not you, an happy year;</l>
            <l>And by the greatness of their Presents prove</l>
            <l>How much they hope, but not how well they love;</l>
            <l>The Muses (who your early courtship boast,</l>
            <l>Though now your flames are with their beauty lost)</l>
            <l>Yet watch their time, that if you have forgot</l>
            <l>They were your Mistresses, the World may not:</l>
            <l>Decay'd by time and wars, they only prove</l>
            <l>Their former beauty by your former love;</l>
            <l>And now present, as antient Ladies do</l>
            <l>That courted long at length are forc'd to woo.</l>
            <l>For still they look on you with such kind eyes</l>
            <l>As those that see the Churches Soveraign rise</l>
            <l>From their own Order chose, in whose high State</l>
            <l>They think themselves the second choice of Fate.</l>
            <l>When our Great Monarch into Exile went</l>
            <l>Wit and Religion suffer'd banishment:</l>
            <l>Thus once when <hi>Troy</hi> was wrapt in fire and smoak</l>
            <l>The helpless Gods their burning shrines forsook;</l>
            <l>They with the vanquisht Prince and party go,</l>
            <l>And leave their Temples empty to the fo:</l>
            <l>At length the Muses stand restor'd again</l>
            <l>To that great charge which Nature did ordain;</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:105794:3"/>
And their lov'd Druyds seem reviv'd by Fate</l>
            <l>While you dispence the Laws and guide the State.</l>
            <l>The Nations soul (our Monarch) does dispence</l>
            <l>Through you to us his vital influence;</l>
            <l>You are the Chanel where those spirits flow</l>
            <l>And work them higher as to us they go.</l>
            <l>In open prospect nothing bounds our eye</l>
            <l>Until the Earth seems joyn'd unto the Sky:</l>
            <l>So in this Hemisphaer our utmost view</l>
            <l>Is only bounded by our King and you:</l>
            <l>Our sight is limited where you are joyn'd</l>
            <l>And beyond that no farther Heav'n can find.</l>
            <l>So well your Vertues do with his agree</l>
            <l>That though your Orbs of different greatness be,</l>
            <l>Yet both are for each others use dispos'd,</l>
            <l>His to inclose, and yours to be inclos'd.</l>
            <l>Nor could another in your room have been</l>
            <l>Except an Emptinesse had come between.</l>
            <l>Well may he then to you his Cares impart</l>
            <l>And share his burden where he shares his heart.</l>
            <l>In you his sleep still wakes; his pleasures find</l>
            <l>Their share of bus'nesse in your labr'ing mind:</l>
            <l>So when the weary Sun his place resigns</l>
            <l>He leaves his light and by reflection shines.</l>
            <l>Justice that sits and frowns where publick Laws</l>
            <l>Exclude soft mercy from a private cause,</l>
            <l>In your Tribunal most her self does please;</l>
            <l>There only smiles because she lives at ease;</l>
            <l>And like young <hi>David</hi> finds her strength the more</l>
            <l>When disincumberd from those arms she wore:</l>
            <l>Heav'n would your Royal Master should exceed</l>
            <l>Most in that Vertue which we most did need,</l>
            <l>And his mild Father (who too late did find</l>
            <l>All mercy vain but what with pow'r was joyn'd,)</l>
            <l>His fatal goodnesse left to fitter times,</l>
            <l>Not to increase but to absolve our Crimes:</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:105794:3"/>
But when the Heir of this vast treasure knew</l>
            <l>How large a Legacy was left to you,</l>
            <l>(Too great for any Subject to retain)</l>
            <l>He wisely ti'd it to the Crown again:</l>
            <l>Yet passing through your hands it gathers more,</l>
            <l>As streams through Mines bear tincture of their Ore.</l>
            <l>While Emp'rique politicians use deceipt,</l>
            <l>Hide what they give, and cure but by a cheat;</l>
            <l>You boldly show that skill which they pretend,</l>
            <l>And work by means as noble as your end:</l>
            <l>Which, should you veil, we might unwind the clue</l>
            <l>As men do Nature, till we came to you.</l>
            <l>And as the <hi>Indies</hi> were not found before</l>
            <l>Those rich perfumes which from the happy shore</l>
            <l>The winds upon their balmy wings convay'd,</l>
            <l>Whose guilty sweetnesse first their World betray'd;</l>
            <l>So by your Counsels we are brought to view</l>
            <l>A rich and undiscover'd World in you.</l>
            <l>By you our Monarch does that same assure</l>
            <l>VVhich Kings must have or cannot live secure:</l>
            <l>For prosp'rous Princes gain the Subjects heart,</l>
            <l>VVho love that praise in which themselves have part:</l>
            <l>By you he fits those Subjects to obey,</l>
            <l>As Heavens Eternal Monarch does convey</l>
            <l>His pow'r unseen, and man to his designs,</l>
            <l>By his bright Ministers the Stars, inclines.</l>
            <l>Our setting Sun from his declining seat</l>
            <l>Shot beams of kindnesse on you, not of heat;</l>
            <l>And when his love was bounded in a few,</l>
            <l>That were unhappy that they might be true;</l>
            <l>Made you the favo'rite of his last sad times,</l>
            <l>That is a suff'rer in his Subjects crimes:</l>
            <l>Thus those first favours you receiv'd were sent</l>
            <l>Like Heav'ns rewards, in earthly punishment.</l>
            <l>Yet Fortune conscious of your destiny</l>
            <l>Ev'n then took care to lay you softly by:</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:105794:4"/>
And wrapt your fate among her precious things,</l>
            <l>Kept fresh to be unfolded with your Kings.</l>
            <l>Shown all at once you dazled so our eyes,</l>
            <l>As new-born <hi>Pallas</hi> did the Gods surprise;</l>
            <l>When springing forth from <hi>Iove</hi>'s new-closing wound</l>
            <l>She struck the Warlick Spear into the ground;</l>
            <l>VVhich sprouting leaves did suddenly inclose,</l>
            <l>And peaceful Olives shaded as they rose.</l>

            <l>Peace is not freed from labour but from noise;</l>
            <l>And VVar more force but not more pains employs;</l>
            <l>Such is the mighty swiftnesse of your mind</l>
            <l>That (like the earth's) it leaves our sence behind;</l>
            <l>VVhile you so smoothly turn and roul our Sphear,</l>
            <l>That rapid motion does but rest appear.</l>
            <l>For as in Natures swiftnesse, with the throng</l>
            <l>Of flying Orbs while ours is born along,</l>
            <l>All seems at rest to the deluded eye:</l>
            <l>(Mov'd by the Soul of the fame harmony)</l>
            <l>So carry'd on by your unwearied care</l>
            <l>VVe rest in Peace and yet in motion share.</l>
            <l>Let Envy then those Crimes within you see</l>
            <l>From which the Happy never must be free;</l>
            <l>(Envy that does with misery reside,</l>
            <l>The joy and the revenge of ruin'd Pride;)</l>
            <l>Think it not hard if at so cheap a rate</l>
            <l>You can secure the constancy of Fate,</l>
            <l>VVhose kindnesse sent, what does their malice seem,</l>
            <l>By lesser ills the greater to redeem.</l>
            <l>Nor can we this weak show'r a tempest call</l>
            <l>But drops of heat that in the Sun-shine fall.</l>
            <l>You have already weary'd Fortune so</l>
            <l>She can not farther be your friend or fo;</l>
            <l>But sits all breathlesse, and admires to feel</l>
            <l>A Fate so weighty that it stops her wheel.</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:105794:4"/>
In all things else above our humble fate</l>
            <l>Your equal mind yet swells not into state,</l>
            <l>But like some mountain in those happy Isles</l>
            <l>VVhere in perpetual Spring young Nature smiles,</l>
            <l>Your greatnesse shows: no horrour to afright</l>
            <l>But Trees for shade, and Flow'rs to court the sight;</l>
            <l>Sometimes the Hill submits itself a while</l>
            <l>In small descents, which do its height beguile;</l>
            <l>And sometimes mounts, but so as billows play</l>
            <l>VVhose rise not hinders but makes short our way.</l>
            <l>Your brow which does no fear of thunder know</l>
            <l>Sees rouling tempests vainly beat below;</l>
            <l>And (like <hi>Olympus</hi> top,) th' impression wears</l>
            <l>Of Love and Friendship writ in former years.</l>
            <l>Yet unimpair'd with labours or with time</l>
            <l>Your age but seems to a new youth to climb.</l>
            <l>Thus Heav'nly bodies do our time beget;</l>
            <l>And measure Change, but share no part of it.</l>
            <l>And still it shall without a weight increase,</l>
            <l>Like this New-year, whose motions never cease;</l>
            <l>For since the glorious Course you have begun</l>

            <l>It must both weightlesse and immortal prove,</l>
            <l>Because the Center of it is above.</l>
