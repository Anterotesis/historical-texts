            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The <hi>Caſe</hi> of many <hi>Proteſtants</hi> in the County of <hi>Cambridge,</hi> humbly tendred to the Conſideration of the preſent <hi>PARLIAMENT.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>IT would be tedious to enumerate the Names and Particulars of the Sufferings of <hi>Proteſtants</hi> in this County, from a ſevere Execution of the Laws expreſſely made in the Reigns of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> and King <hi>James,</hi> againſt Papiſts; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we intend with all Modeſty to repreſent our own Caſe, we ſhall not take notice what favour the Papiſts (who indeed are but few) have found amongſt us, nor ſhould we rejoyce in their Proſecution, but we muſt ſay, the Burden lyes heavy upon us, that do in our Souls deteſt Popiſh Idolatries.</p>
            <p>Many of us have been long proceeded againſt, and Returned into the <hi>Exchequer</hi> as <hi>Popiſh Recuſants;</hi> and there are about Fifty Free-holders, as ſuch, made Tenants to his Majeſty, and the two Thirds of their Revenue levyed upon them in ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, that it were better for them to hold their Lands of a Neighbour Gentleman at a Rack-rent; and even beyond the Extent of the Law the Copy-hold Lands of ſome are ſeized.</p>
            <p>We have given all poſſible demonſtration in our ſpheres of our Abhorrence of Popery, and of our Senſe of the Danger threatning his Majeſty and the Proteſtant Religion from the Helliſh Popiſh Plot, and yet ſince the moſt happy Diſcovery thereof, we have found a more rigorous Execution of theſe Laws than in all the time of his Majeſties Reign: For ſince the Elections to this Parliament, we have had at leaſt One hundred and fifty Proteſtants convicted as Recuſants, and ſome are now Priſoners upon thoſe Laws, and all proſecuted in the <hi>Exchequer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Francis Holcroft</hi> a Nonconformiſt Miniſter, being met alone upon the Road in <hi>June</hi> laſt, by <hi>Thomas Ducket</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> a Captain in the Militia, was taken Priſoner by him about ſeven miles from <hi>Cambridge,</hi> and committed to the common Gaole by a Warrant of ſomething an unuſual nature from the Captain and his Lievtenant.</p>
            <p>It was Enacted in the 35 of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> That if any perſon ſhall forbear for the ſpace of a Month to hear Divine Service, and ſhall be preſent at a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venticle, and be thereof Convicted, he ſhall be committed to Priſon, there to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main till he Conforms and makes the Declaration and Submiſſion in that Act di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected: And that upon refuſal he ſhall Abjure the Realm, and if he ſhall not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part, or abjuring, ſhall retutn, he ſhall dye as a Felon without Benefit of Clergy.</p>
            <p>Some not being contented to keep Mr. <hi>Holcroft</hi> Priſoner, are putting this Law in Execution upon him, an Accompt whereof follows.</p>
