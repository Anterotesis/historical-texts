         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as the wise
man had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templated,
and by long expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
learned the mutabilitie
of all things, neither had found
any constancie, or certainelie
very little, in any thing created
in this world, but many desires,
&amp; an vnsatiable thirst of men,
which violently forced them,
to hunt after these transitorie
things; at length he cryeth out.
<hi>Vanity of vanities,<note place="margin">Eccles, 1.</note> all is vanity &amp;
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:8182:15"/>
affliction of spirit.</hi> And when he
had runne thorow, and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rime<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted
all things in the world,
with a most wholesome coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell
he concludeth his disputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<note place="margin">Eccle. 12.</note> saying; <hi>Remember thy
Creator in the dayes of thy youth,
whiles the euill dayes come not, nor
the yeeres approch, wherein thou
shalt say, I haue no pleasure in
them: whiles the Sun is not dark,
nor the light, nor the Moone, nor
the starres, nor the clowdes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne
after the raine. Feare God
and keepe his commaundements:
for this is the whole dutie of man.</hi>
And because the whole safety
of our soules, and all our bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sednes
dependeth of this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell,
it is most aptly and fitlie
spoken of S. Gregory; That
there is no such sacrifice offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to the Almightie, as the
zeale of the soule is: vvhich
sheweth by vvholesome doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:8182:15"/>
the vvay vnto celestiall
glory. I beeing therefore mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
by this zeale, although vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
to teach, haue gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
this short tractate out of
diuers authorities of holy doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
that a soule drowned in
the pollution of sinne, beeing
conuicted by these instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
&amp; authorities of holy men,
and enlightned of the holie
Ghost, might bee reduced to
her Creator and Redeemer, as
a straying and lost sheepe, or at
the length might know her e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state,
and the errors and daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
which she in this vvorld
is in, whilst shee continueth in
sinne, and being touched with
the sorrow of contrition, might
returne vnto God, and retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
might bring forth repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
and repenting, might
possesse with al the Saints, glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
and celestiall beatitude, to
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:8182:16"/>
the which shee was made and
created. But to this there is no
other way, then that, of which
the Prophet speaketh: <hi>This is
the way,<note place="margin">Esay, 30,</note> walke yee in it, neyther
shall yee decline to the right hand,
nor to the left.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Therefore it is needfull for
a Christian man, that is vvil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
after thys wretched life to
goe to his desired home, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
prayers and common ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercises,
to vse also dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, that
his hart may bee lifted vp vnto
God, not onely in euery place,
but also that at all times, and in
all businesses, hee may carrie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
with him cogitations, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously
imployed about religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
&amp; godly contemplations.
As a Bee delighted vvith the

from euery flower, and

that the seruant of God
should take of all things crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
which are presented vnto
his minde, as it were certaine
spurrs pricking forwards vnto

God, meditating on them in

                  <p>First, giue him thanks for the
rest hee hath giuen thee that

thee from al perrillous and
feareful fantasies, and from the
snares of thine enemy; and for
all other benefites, of creation,
preseruation, vocation, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption:
that he hath called
thee to his fayth, that hee hath
infused into thee good inspy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations,
that he hath freed thee
from all danger, that so long a
time, with so great patience &amp;
mercy hee hath waited for thy
repentance. And to be briefe,
yeelde vnto him most hartie
thanks for all blessings whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer.</p>
                  <p>Then offer vnto him what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer
that day thou shalt ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
doe or suffer; all thy la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>labours,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:8182:18"/>
all thy stepps, all thine
exercises, and briefely, all that
which thou art to doe, or to be
imployed in that day. Offer
vnto him in like manner, thy
selfe, with all thine, that al may
redound to his glorie, that hee
may haue a hand in all, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spose
of all, as it shall please his
most holy, will, none otherwise
then if they were his owne bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesses.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, desire his fauour &amp;
grace, that thou mayst not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitt
any thing that day, that
shall be contrarie to his diuine

those, which customarily thou
art most inclined to, as are an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,

wordes, and such like: arming
thy selfe with a firme resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
against all kind of vices.</p>

all thy negligences, idlenes,
&amp; slothfull heauines, about the

that so wickedly thou hast for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten

                  <p>Desire God, that hee would

all the sinnes which thou
hast committed, and that hee

of the howre, say; Blessed be

Iesus Christ was borne and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for vs; ô Lorde remember
mee in the howre of my death.
And consider howe thy life is
shorter by an hower then it

thee meate and drinke, vvho
hath created all things for thy

for the foode hee sendeth thee,
and ponder with thy selfe how
many men almost perrishe
through hunger and vvant,
then which thine estate is farre
happier; remember with what
ease and safety thou possessest
those things, which others can
hardly compasse with great
danger and labour.</p>
                  <p>When thou art impugned
or molested of the deuill that

is, if thou runnest vnto

that hee might destroy the

and intreate him with great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion,
that hee would not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
a thing so odious to raigne
in thine heart, or in thine eyes,
which he with so great cost &amp;

and say, ô my Lord, thou han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest

I might not sinne: and shall
not this be sufficient for mee,
that I may flie from sinne?<note place="margin">A prayer against te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ptations.</note> I

                  <p>If thou shalt reiect &amp; refuse

and they shall bring it to passe,

                  <head>The first Meditation, for Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day:
of the miserie in which man

                  <p>THE Prophet Ieremy
deploring the misery of
his own condition, saith;
<hi>How is it,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ierem. 20.</note> 
                     <hi>that I cam forth
of the wombe, to see labour and
sorrow, that my dayes should be
consumed with shame?</hi> If the
Prophet sanctified in his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
vvombe so lamentablie
spake of himselfe, what shall I
miserable and vvretched man
say, conceaued and borne of
my Mother in sinne?<note place="margin">Hugo lib. 3. de anima.</note> 
                     <hi>Hugo de
S. Victore</hi> doth very well coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saile
vs; ô man, sayth he, learne
to know thy selfe: Thou art
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:8182:26"/>
better if thou knowest thy self,
then if neglecting thy self, thou
knevvest the motions of the
starres, the vertue of hearbs, the
complexions of men, and the
natures of al heauenly &amp; earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
creatures. For many men
know many things, and know
not themselues, vvhen as the
knowledge of our selues is the
chiefest Philosophy.</p>
                  <p>Consider therefore ô man,<note place="margin">What man was before hee was borne.</note>
vvhat thou wast before thou
wert born: what thou art now
thou art borne vntill thou re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne
to dust: and what thou
shalt be after death. Before
thou wast borne, wast thou a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other thing, but an impure
and vncleane matter, concea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
of the corruption of the
flesh, in the pollution of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
in the heat of lust, and that
vvhich is vvorst of all, in the
corruption of sinne? Ponder
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:8182:26"/>
also with thy selfe, with what
meat thou wast nourished be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
conceaued in thy mothers
wombe; surely with none o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
then with impure, men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struous
and hurtfull blood,
which stayeth in women from
the time of theyr conceauing,
that by it theyr yong ones may
be nourished in their wombes.
Remember that GOD hath
created thee of the slime of the
earth, which is the basest ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
Hee created the starres
and planets of fire, birds of the
ayre, and fishes of water: but
men and other creatures of the
slime of the earth. Therfore
compare thy selfe with the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shes
and beasts bred of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and thou shalt find thy self
of a more abiect nature, &amp; vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
condition, then they are. If
thou beholdest the fowles and
creatures that liue in the ayre,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:8182:27"/>
neyther art thou to be compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
vnto them: if thou consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derest
the nature of the Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets,
starres, and other things
made of fire, thou art much
more ignoble. Thou canst
neyther be compared to cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stiall
things, nor be preferred
before terrestriall: but if thou
comparest thy selfe to brute
creatures, in these alone thou
shalt find some semblance and
likelihood with thy selfe, as the
Wiseman testifieth, who sayth,
<hi>That the condition of the children
of men,<note place="margin">Eccles, 3.</note> and the condition of beasts
are euen as one condition vnto
them. As the one dyeth, so dyeth
the other: for they haue all one
breath, and there is no excellency
of man aboue the beast.</hi> For man
hath not, as touching his body,
any more then a beast hath,
seeing both of them are fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
and created of earth, and
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:8182:27"/>
both of them in like maner are
resolued into earth. Remember
that whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thou wast borne, thou
wast brought foorth into thys
miserable world howling and
weeping, as it were foreseeing,
and therfore bewayling the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,
dangers &amp; dolors which
in this worlde are to be sustai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned:
and that which is vvorst
of all, deploring death it selfe.
Wherefore, if perhaps thou
beest borne in a noble and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable
place, neither remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brest
how vile a beginning and
howe abiect an originall thou
haddest; if the beautie of thy
countenaunce, and comlinesse
of thy proportion, if the linea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of thy body, if the fauor
of the people, if the heate of
youth, &amp; aboundance of riches
take away the knowledge of
thy selfe fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thee, yet neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse,
if thou desirest to knovve
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:8182:28"/>
what man is, heare vvhat that

misery, the child of wrath, and
a vessell of indignation &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation.
I was borne in the

proude? ô dust, why growest
thou insolent? ô ashes, for what
woldest thou be commended,
vvhose conception is sinfull,
vvhose natiuitie is painefull,
whose life is labour, and death
necessitie? Why dooest thou
nourish thy body so delicately?
Why dooest thou adorne that
vvith so precious garments,
which after a while shall in the
sepulchre be eaten of vvormes?
VVhy dooest thou not rather
beautifie thy soule vvith good
workes, which shal be carryed
into heauen by the handes of
good Angels? VVhy dooest
thou neglect thy soule, and so
extraordinarilye cocker thy
flesh? Behold confusion and
prepostrous order, the soule,
which ought to rule, serueth
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:8182:30"/>
the flesh; and the fleshe ruleth
which should obey. Why suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferest

to vsurpe authoritie ouer the
Lady? Doost thou not know
that thy flesh is a domestical &amp;
homebred enemie vnto thy
soule, which vnder colour of
friendship, is more cruell then
the most tirannous enemie?
When thou cherishest &amp; deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cately
nourishest it, thou bree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest
and bringest vp thine own
enemie: when thou deckest &amp;
beautifiest it, thou armest thine
enemy against thee: whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thou
arraiest it in precious garments
and outlandish skins of wilde

of all beautifull and heauenly

thou shalt be, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thou ceasest
to liue. Certainely thou shalt

be none other, but a miserable
and corrupted carkasse, an ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation
&amp; foode for wormes.
If it please thee, viewe the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
of them, who are departed
out of this life, and thou shalt
finde nothing in them, besides
ashes, wormes, stinke, &amp; loth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somnes.
What thou art novve,
they sometimes were, &amp; what
they are nowe, thou shortly
must be: they were me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as thou

it may be fuell for the infernall

shall the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> theyr vaine glory pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit

thee, for thou art both a man, &amp;
compounded of the same dust

of; man of earth, slime of slime,
and after death thou shalt bee
turned into dust &amp; ashes, ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
knowest thou where, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
or how. Wherfore, seeing that
death waiteth for thee in euery
place, if thou beest wise, expect
him in like manner at all times,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:8182:32"/>
and in euery place. Let the lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers
of this worlde remember,
sayth Isidore,<note place="margin">Isidore.</note> how short the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitie
of this world is, how bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren
&amp; slender the glory of it is,
and howe weake and fraile the
power is. Tell me if thou canst
where are the Kinges, Princes,
&amp; Emperors of ancient times?
vvhere are the rich and mighty
men of this vvorld? They are
all passed away as a shadow, &amp;
vanished as smoake: and if a
man seeke for them, hee shall
not finde them.</p>
                  <p>VVhat if wee say, that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
of those Kings, Princes, &amp;
Emperours, thought that they
shoulde alwayes conquer, and
neuer die. O blinde and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,
beholde, it is not so, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde
the matter is fallen out
quite otherwise, they are dead,
as other men are, theyr lyfes
haue fayled them, as the lyfes
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:8182:32"/>
of other Princes, that liued and
ruled before them.</p>
                  <p>What the estate of man is af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
death, Saint Bernard dooth
very well teach: VVhat, saith
hee, is more stinking then a
carkasse? what is more horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
then a dead man? He that
was of a beautifull cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tenance,
and comely stature, whilst hee
liued, after death lyeth with a
gastly and fearefull face: for
vvormes, putrefaction &amp; hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror,
follow a dead man. Which
thing, seeing it is so, vvhat doe
riches, delicacies, and honours
profit? Riches doe not deliuer
from death, nor delicacies fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
wormes, nor honours from
corruption.<note place="margin">Chrysost. Epist. ad The odor. Laps.</note> And Saint Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostome

the misery, and vildnes of this

heauy a burthen, that neyther

Euery word, deed, and thought
contrary to the lawe of God,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:8182:35"/>
according to Saint Augustine,
is sinne: which ought, none o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hell to be eschew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of all them, who aspire to
the heauenly kingdome: and
that for three causes,<note place="margin">Sinne is to be eschewed for three things.</note> the first
of which is, because it displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
God: the second, because
it pleaseth the deuill: the third,
because it is hurtfull, and brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
many discommodities to
man.</p>
                  <p>First, I say, thou oughtest to
eschew sinne, because it excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly
displeaseth thy Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour,
in which place we are to
consider, what God hath done
by reason of sinne. No man is
ignorant that for sinne God
hath destroyed the workes of
his owne hands: that for sinne
he hath cast Angels out of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen,
disparadiz'd men, and
drowned with flood of waters
all mankinde, as the booke of
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:8182:35"/>
Genesis vvitnesseth. Other
Kings and Emperours, that
they may reuenge the iniury
done vnto them of theyr ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
doe spoyle and wast their
Countries &amp; Dominions: but
God subuerted and destroyed
his owne kingdome, because
sinne had entred into it. Ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
doth God only hate sinne,
but all that, which by any man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of way pertaineth vnto sin.
Men although the vvine hath
lost his vertue, doe not therfore
cast away the siluer bowles, in
which the wine is, but reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
them, they poure out the
wine: but God not onely ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steth
out sinne, but also toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with sinne hurleth downe
headlong into the deepest O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cean
of hel the vessels, in which
it is, which are creatures &amp; rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
soules, made according
to his owne image, and redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:8182:36"/>
with his precious blood.
Wherupon the wiseman saith:
<hi>Vngodlines, and an vngodly man
are alike hated of God.</hi> That
most patient man Iob sayth:
<hi>Thou doest visite me euery mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Iob. 7.</note> 
                     <hi>and triest me euery moment.</hi>
Therefore in vvhat should I
hope, or wherin should I trust,
but in the mere mercy of God,
and in the affiance of celestiall
grace? For bee it that I dwell
amongst honest men, be it that
I conuerse and dyet with reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious,
deuoute, and faythfull
friends, be it that I reade holy
Bookes, godly Treatises, and
sing heauenly Himnes, yet
they little, or rather nothing
at all profit mee, if the fauour
of GOD forsake mee, and
leaue me to my nakednes and
necessity. Therefore there is
none other remedy, but to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
patience, to deny my
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:8182:36"/>
selfe, and vvholy to yeelde vp
and offer my selfe vnto the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine
will and pleasure. There
was neuer any man so relige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
who did not sometimes
feele himselfe depriued of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine
consolation, and that hee
wanted the zeale and feruour
of the spirit. There neyther
is, nor hath at any time been
any Saint, vvhom temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
hath not sometimes taken
holde of. Certainely, hee is
not woorthy of that high and
sublime contemplation of
GOD, vvho before hath
not for the loue of GOD
been exercised in sundrie and
manifolde tribulations. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
alvvayes the praecedent
temptation is vvoont to bee
a token, that comforte is at
the doores. VVherefore
heauenlie consolation is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
vnto them, that
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:8182:37"/>
are approoued and tried vvith
temptations, which the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
affirmeth, when it is said:
<hi>To him that ouercommeth,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Apoc. 2.</note> 
                     <hi>will I
giue to eat of the tree of life, which
is in the middes of the Paradice
of God.</hi> Wherefore God hath
not eyther in heauen, or vpon
the earth so deere and faithfull
a familier friend, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
hateth not, if he finde deadly
sinne in him. Wherfore albeit
Christ loued Saint Peter en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely,
yet he had condemned
him, if he had died in that sin,
when thrice he denied his lord
and Maister.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Gods hatred to sin
heereby also appeareth, that he
would haue his onely begotten
Sonne dye for the sinnes of
men, as Esay testifieth, saying:
<hi>For the transgression of my peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
haue I strucken and plagued
him.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Esay, 53.</note> And certainly the Sonne
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:8182:37"/>
of God himselfe, that he might
destroy sinne,<note place="margin">Ibidem.</note> deliuered his
owne soule into the hands of
death, as the same Prophet
sayth. Who was euer found
boyling with so great wrath a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
his enemies, who that he
might destroy them, slewe his
onely Sonne?</p>
                  <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">God pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueth and punisheth sinne euery where.</note> Gods detestation
to sinne is heereby also gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
that he hath persecuted it
euen from the beginning of
the world, to the end, not in
one place, but wheresoeuer he
found it. He found it in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen,
and thence he banished it;
when he saw it remaining vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
the earth, he came in his
owne person, that hee might
expell it thence, and at the last
in the finall iudgement he vvill
confine &amp; include sinne with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the limits and bonds of hell,
as in his naturall place, as the
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:8182:38"/>
Prophet testifieth, saying; <hi>And
he will cast all our sinnes into the
bottome of the Sea.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Micah. 7.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, how greatly sinne
displeaseth God, this similitude
argueth:<note place="margin">A Simily.</note> vvithout all doubt
that fault is very odious and
abhominable, that causeth a
Mother to cast her beloued
Sonne into a burning furnace,
and not once to assay to take
him thence againe: so certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
there must needes be some
great matter in it, and excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly
odious vnto God, for
which hee should cast his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
into eternall flames, if hee
finde sinne in them; vvhom
notwithstanding hee so loued,
that hee refused not to dye for
them. Thou seest heere ô sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
soule, how odious and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hominable
all sin is vnto God.
Wherefore if thou desirest to
please God, it is necessary, that
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:8182:38"/>
thou keepe thy selfe free and
clean from sinne, so that it pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sesse
not the least place in thee.
For shee shall be accounted a
very vnfaythfull woman,<note place="margin">A Simily.</note> who
admitteth into her bed an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
man besides her husband,
but especially, if shee admitte
one, that is his enemy, and of
whom hee is to expect many
discommodities and iniuries:
so also vnfaithfull is that soule,
vvhich of purpose and vvil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
giueth place vnto sinne,
vvhich Christ our Redeemer
the true spouse of our souls ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
so deadly; which wrought
him so many disco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modities, so
many losses, so many torments,
and for vvhich, he vvas hanged
naked vpon the Crosse. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
heere it pleaseth and liketh
mee vvell to imitate that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall
Prophet and svveete sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of Israell, and saye:
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:8182:39"/>
                     <hi>Create in me a cleane hart,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Psal. 51.</note> 
                     <hi>ô God,
and renue a right spirit within
mee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>VVee sayd that the second
reason why sinne was to be es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chewed,<note place="margin">Sinne ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uil merry.</note>
is, because it maketh
merry our auntient enemy the
deuill: vvhich is gathered by
three signes and tokens. The
first is, because hee seeketh for
nothing in the whole world so
industriously: he hunteth not
after gold, nor siluer, nor preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
stones, but after soules, as it
is figured in Genesis, where the
King of Sodome sayth in the
person of the deuill; <hi>Giue mee
the soules,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Gen. 14.</note> 
                     <hi>and take the goods to
thy selfe.</hi> Saint Gregory affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
the same thing:<note place="margin">Gregory.</note> Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
thy selfe, that the deuill
seeketh for none other thing,
then to deceaue and destroy
soules:<note place="margin">A Simily.</note> for as an Hawke desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
nothing so much, as the
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:8182:39"/>
hart of that bird, which he pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sueth:
so the deuill desireth
nothing so much as the soule
of a sinner.</p>
                  <p>The second signe, whereby
we know that the deuill doth
loue sin is the continuall temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
by which he impugneth
and molesteth men, neyther is
euer wearied in solliciting man
vnto sinne. For there are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
nowe past sixe thousand
yeares, in all which time hee
hath onely applied himselfe to
this study, that he might sinne,
and make man to sinne: ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is he tyred, yea hee daily
findeth and inuenteth nevve
kinds of sinne, hee is still nim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bler
and busier in his endeuors
and temptations, &amp; daily brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
men into new errours, as
wee see in the booke of Iob.
For when as God asked him,
whence he came? he aunswe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red:
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:8182:40"/>
                     <hi>From compassing the earth
to and fro,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Iob, 1.</note> 
                     <hi>and from walking in it.</hi>
Hee is so busied in preferring
sinne, that he hath not time to
take any rest, as Iob testifieth:
<hi>They that pierce me through,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Iob, 30.</note> saith
he, <hi>doe not sleepe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The third signe, that sinne
pleaseth the deuill, is, that hee
can neuer be satisfied with sin.
For although infinit thousands
of men haue descended to hell
for their impiety and pollution
of sinne, of whom the deuill is
the ringleader, yet he is not sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied,
but alwayes hungerly,
<hi>Like a roaring Lyon walketh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1, Pet. 5.</note> 
                     <hi>seeking whom hee may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoure,</hi>
as Saint Peter testifieth
in his first Epistle generall. He
so hungreth and thirsteth, as it
is sayd in the booke of Iob, that
<hi>he drinketh vp the riuer,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Iob, 40.</note> 
                     <hi>and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steth
not: and hee trusteth that
hee can draw vp Iorden into his
<pb facs="tcp:8182:40"/>
mouth.</hi> His mouth is hell, and
the riuer that runneth into his
hellish mouth are sinners, vvho
with great celerity, as swift ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers,
hast into his iawes, whom
hee swalloweth vp with great
thirst and desire. It is reported
in the lifes of the Fathers, that
the Prince of deuils did com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
and honour one of his
traine; yea, commaunded him
to sitte in his chayre of estate
crovvned, because hee had
brought a certayne religious
man to the sinne of luxurie,
vvhom hee had beene enticing
fourty yeeres, and could not
bring him to nibble or byte at
his bayte.</p>
                  <p>Therefore mourne and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
ô sinfull soule, verie bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terlie,
seeing thou hast so often
reioyced thy mortall enemies,
by sinning so mortallie to thy
greate losse and daunger,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:8182:41"/>
and in steede thereof yeeld re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
and a pure conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of heart vnto God, that
God and his Angells may in
like manner reioyce. For <hi>there
is ioy in the presence of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
of God,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Luke, 15.</note> 
                     <hi>for one sinner that
conuerteth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The third principall reason,<note place="margin">The dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage and hurt that comes to the soule by sinne.</note>
for which sinne is to be esche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed,
is the great dammage we
reape by it. For first by sinne
wee are estranged from God,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> and made his enemies. This is
that, which Esay saith: <hi>Your ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities
haue seperated betweene
you and your God,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Esay. 59.</note> 
                     <hi>and your sinnes
haue hid his face from you, that
he will not heare.</hi> If all the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
Cittizens of that heauenly
Country could either sinne, or
would sinne, they should fall
from heauen into the bottom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les
depth of hell, and should
vtterly loose the amity and
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:8182:41"/>
friendship, which they haue
with God. Heere-vpon Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine
saith:<note place="margin">Augustine.</note> If thy faythfull
friend offend thee, thou thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kest
him woorthy to be repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended:
howe much more
worthy art thou to be blamed,
if thou sinnest against almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
God, thy most gracious and
mercifull Father?</p>
                  <p>Secondly, sinne maketh his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/>
Author guilty of infernall tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
And because the diuine
law doth not much differ from
humaine constitutions, that
which mans lawe doth to the
body, the same Gods lawe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicteth
vpon the soule. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
mark how the law of man
maketh the transgressor of the
Kings commaundement, and
the contemner of his royall
Maiesty guilty of death; as it
is written in Ezra, where it is
remembred that King Darius,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:8182:42"/>
when he had promulgated his
decree as concerning the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edifying
of the temple at Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem,
added at the end of his

                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/> The third losse is, sinne spoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth

                     <note place="margin">Prou. 19.</note> Neither
is a sinner onely miserable, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause

ô thou sinner howe vnhappy

                  <p>These things being thus, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member

these three mayne and

bringeth vnto thee, that is, the

but respect vvhat thy
soule willeth: for Saint Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory
sayth: where the body
liueth a while in delights, there
the soule is tortured with per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall
torments. And by how
much the body is afflicted in
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:8182:46"/>
this life, by so much the spirit
reioyceth in the other. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Saint Augustine admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sheth
vs very well: Let vs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
our owne vvills for Iesus
Christ: for they must once be
forsaken: neither doth it please
God that for temporall things
we should loose eternall bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings.
If thou wast permitted
certayne yeares to liue in the
delights of this flesh, with this
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dition, that afterwards thine
eyes should be plucked out, or
that thou being depriued of all
delicates, shouldest most mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably
perrish through hunger
and thirst, and wretchedly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
with famine, affliction, &amp;
misery, I perswade my self, that
thou wouldest neuer wish for
such manner of delicats. What
I pray thee is this life? In truth
it is not the space of one mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth;
vvhat doe I say of a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth?
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:8182:46"/>
Nay, it is not the space
of one houre, not of a minute,
no not of a moment, if it bee
compared to that eternall bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude,
or to those torments of
hell, vvhich haue none ende,
and lyke which none can bee
thought of.</p>

Crosse, and carry it with perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerance,
if they desire to raigne
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:8182:47"/>

Saint Hierome writing to Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sanna,
saith: that repentance
ought to be equall, or greater
then the sinnes.<note place="margin">Hier. in an Epistle to Susanna.</note> That repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
is necessary, sayth hee,
which may either equalize the
faults, or exceede them. And
Saint Augustine saith: Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer
will be saued, it is nece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
that hee be washed at the
least with the teares of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition
of his hart, being clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
before by baptisme from
all those blemishes and polluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
which sinne had spotted
and soyled him withall. But if
thou shalt say, that this is a hard
saying, and that thou canst not
forsake the world, nor hate thy
flesh, nor chastice thy body:
heare what is sayd, not of mee,
but of Saint Hierome:<note place="margin">Hier in an Epistle to Iuliana. cap.</note> It is a
difficult thing, nay it is impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible,
that any one should enioy
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:8182:47"/>
both present and future bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings:
that hee should fill his
belly heere, and his soule there:
that from delicacies he should
passe vnto delightes: that in
both worlds he should be gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
&amp; carry his head aloft, and
that hee should appeare glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
both in heauen, &amp; in earth.
Which sentence Saint Grego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
confirmeth: Many, saith he
doe desire to flye out of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ile
of this present life, vnto ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestiall
ioy, who in the meane
time will not forsake the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
of this world. The grace
of Christ Iesus doth call them,
but the concupiscence of the
world doth detaine the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. They
desire to dye the death of the
righteous, but they wil not liue
as they doe: such shall euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stingly
perrish, because theyr
works shal follow them. The
austerity of holy Iohn Baptists
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:8182:48"/>
life, sayth Saint Bernard, is a
hard sentence of death vnto
sinners: who when there arose
not a greater then hee among
those that are born of women,
did so chastice, correct, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict
his most innocent body:
and yee hast to be clothed with

well sayde of S. Augustine:
Vaine is that repe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tance,<note place="margin">August. in his Solilo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quies.</note> which
the future fault doth pollute:
lamentations do nothing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit,

for euils, if eftsoons thou renu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
&amp; reiteratest thy follies.<note place="margin">Three parts of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</note> We
must note for the further ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestation
of this matter, that
true repentance doth co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sist of
three parts, which are, contriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of hart, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fession of mouth,
&amp; satisfaction of deed. For we
haue offended God three ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of vvayes, by delight of
thought, by lapse of tong, and
by pride of works: and these
three are to be cured by three
contrarie remedies, delight
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:8182:49"/>
of thought by the sorrow and
contrition of hart: the lapse of
the tongue by the confession
of the mouth: and the pride
of workes by vpright and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corupted
satisfaction. Of these
three parts therefore wee will
speake,<note place="margin">Contrition what it is.</note> and first of contrition,
which is a voluntary greefe ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
for sinne committed, with
a purpose of confession, satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction,
and heereafter not to
sinne any more. Contrition
must haue foure degrees ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to Bernard:<note place="margin">In his 16. Sermon vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the Cant.</note> Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more
know, saith he, that thou
hast wholy recouered thy wits
and sences, if thou feelest thy
conscience to be bitten with a
fourefold compunction, with a
double shamfastnes, and with a
double feare. Therfore in thy
plangors and lamentations for
thy selfe, think of God thy ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker,
think of thy father, think of
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:8182:49"/>
him, who is bountiful &amp; graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
&amp; think of thy Lord: and
knowe that thou art guilty in
each respect; deplore and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
each offence; thy feare
doth make aunswer to the first
and last, &amp; thy shamfastnes to
the two in the midst. Be it that
thy Father doth wink at thee,
that he that is bountiful &amp; gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
doth pardon thee: but
thy Lord &amp; Creatour will not.
He that spared not his Son, wil
not spare the workmanship of
his hands, nor a wicked seruant
&amp;c. We offend the Lord our
God the Creator of all things:
we more wickedly offend our
heauenly father, being so graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
&amp; bountifull; who doth
support, &amp; nourish vs, in which
thing we are worse then dogs,
who do loue &amp; folow them, of
whom they are nourished; but
most vilely we offend God, by
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:8182:50"/>
crucifying againe by sinne our
Redeemer, as much as lieth in
vs, who hath redeemed vs by
his most precious blood, and
hath deliuered vs from all the
snarés &amp; entrappings of sinns,
from the cruelty of deuils, and
fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> infernall punishments. We
must bee sorrowfull for three
things, for sin committed, for

Augustin speaketh of the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trition. The co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trition
of the hart auaileth more, then

part of repentance, S. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustin
saith, that it is the health

of wicked spirits, a feare of hel,
an impedime<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the deuill. O

Heare what S. Isidore saith:<note place="margin">Isidor. lib. de Etym.</note> It
is confession by which the lur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
disease of the soule is ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to the prayse of God, in
hope to obtaine pardon. Of
which vertue Ambrose sayth;
When confession proceedeth
fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a man, then the vengeance
of God ceaseth. And Cassio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorus
saith; Iesus Christ is not
their Iudge, but their Aduocat,
who accuse the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues by theyr
own co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fession. Leo also agreeth
with these:<note place="margin">Leo in a Sermon.</note> that is not to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned,

                     <pb n="73" facs="tcp:8182:51"/>
For the confession of sins is the
beginning of righteousnes.</p>
                  <p>Of satis-faction,<note place="margin">Satisfactio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> which is a
third part of repentance, thus
speaketh S. Augustine:<note place="margin">Augustine in his Soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loquities.</note> Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
is to cut of the causes of
sin, and not to cherrish by sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gestions
any entrance into the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.
Gregory sayth thus:<note place="margin">Gregory.</note> vvee do
not satis-fie, although we cease
from iniquitie, vnlesse, on the
contrary side we persecute by
opposite bewaylings, the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures,
which wee loued. Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostome
consenteth vnto thys.
The reconciliation, sayth hee,
ought to be equal to the prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
offence: thou oughtest to
be as readie to lament, as to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend,
and as thine intent vvas
to offend, such also ought thy
deuotion to bee in repenting;
for great sinnes doe require al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
great greefe and sorrow.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore, Eusebius sayth:
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:8182:52"/>
A light and slight contrition,
dooth not effect,<note place="margin">Hom 5, ad Monachos.</note> that those
debts may be forgiue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to which
euerlasting death is due: ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is a transitory satisfaction,
sufficient for those euils, for
which eternall fire is prepared.
There is neede of much vvee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping,
of much mourning, of
great griefe of heart, to heale
the griefes and sorrowes of the
hart. We must endeuour with
the vvhole contrition of the
spyrite, that those olde euills,
vvhich as arrowes stick in our
consciences, may be pulled out.
It is not sufficient, vvith the
lips onely to say; I haue offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
spare me, &amp; remit my sins.
But we are presently weary, &amp;
looke behind vs, as Lots vvife
did; wherfore we are diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sider the words of Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard;
He that perfectly know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
sayth he, the burden of sin,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:8182:52"/>
&amp; the plagues &amp; greeua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces of
his soul, he shal litle or nothing
at all feele the punishments &amp;
castigations of his body, ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
shall they be troublesome
vnto him, certainly perswading
himselfe that God wil haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
vnto him, &amp; that he shall
auoyd those things, which hee
was desposed and prepared to
commit. Hereupon S. Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine
saith,<note place="margin">Augustine in Psal, 50,</note> writing vpon the
Psalme; <hi>Haue mercy vpon me, ô
God:</hi> Many there be, sayth he,
that are not ashamed to sinne,
but they are ashamed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent.
O incredible madnes, art
thou not ashamed of thy

the binding vp of thy wound?
Is it not being naked more vg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly?
Run therfore to the Phisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
repent, &amp; say; <hi>I doe confesse

<pb n="76" facs="tcp:8182:53"/>
onely haue I sinned, and done this

                  </p>
                  <p>Satisfaction consisteth in
three things;<note place="margin">In what things satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth.</note> In prayer, Almes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deedes,
&amp; Fasting: which are
as it were certaine antidotes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
so many capitall vices,
by which we offend GOD:
and these three vices doe arise
from three principall enemies
of our soules. Pride is ingende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
of the deuill, couetousnes
of the world, &amp; luxury of our
own flesh: of which thus spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
Saint Iohn: <hi>All that is in
the world,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1, Iohn, 2,</note> 
                     <hi>is the lust of the flesh,
the lust of the eyes, and the pride
of life.</hi> Prayer restraineth pride,
Almes-deedes banisheth coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousnesse,
and fasting brideleth
lust. Furthermore, wee alwayes
sinne eyther against God, and
so in like manner prayer is op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
against all that sin, &amp; by
it we are accepted of God, as
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:8182:53"/>
as the Wise-man saith: <hi>The
prayer of him that humbleth him
selfe,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ecclus, 35,</note> 
                     <hi>goeth thorowe the clowdes,
and coaseth not till it come neere,
and will not depart till the most
High haue respect therevnto:</hi> or
we sinne against our selues, &amp;
against such a sinne, fasting is
effectuall, according to that of
Augustine: Restraine &amp; bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
your flesh by fasting &amp; ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinence:
Or we sinne against
our neighbour, &amp; here almes-deedes
are of force; of which
our Sauiour speaketh in Luke,
<hi>Giue almes,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Luke, 11,</note> 
                     <hi>and all things shall be
cleane to you.</hi> For as water ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguisheth
fire, so almes-deeds
quench sinne. Almes-deedes
are called the water of GOD,
and a precept of mercy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded
vnto vs of the sonne
of God.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore for three causes
we are bound to giue almes, &amp;
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:8182:54"/>
to exercise the works of chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie:
<note place="margin">The fruites of almes-deedes.</note>
First, because by mercy sin
is wiped away: VVhereupon
Salomon sayth: <hi>By mercie and
truth,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Prou, 16,</note> 
                     <hi>iniquitie shall bee forgiuen.</hi>
The Scripture maketh menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of that poore widdow, who
hauing but a little oyle,<note place="margin">2, King. 4.</note> and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercising
mercy, filled all her
empty vessels, &amp; the oyle was
so multiplied, that shee had e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to pay her debts, and to
satisfie all her creditors. These
empty vessels are the poore,
whom we must bring into our
houses,<note place="margin">Esay, 58.</note> according to that say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Esay; <hi>Deale thy bread to
the hungry, bring the poore that
wander, home to thyne house,
when thou seest the naked, couer
him, and hide not thy selfe from
thine owne flesh.</hi> Like vnto thys
is the counsell of Tobias, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
vnto his sonne; <hi>Giue almes
of thy substance;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Tob, 4,</note> 
                     <hi>and when thou
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:8182:54"/>
giuest almes, let not thine eye bee
enuious, neyther turne thy face
from any poore, least God turne
his face from thee. Giue almes
according to thy substance: if
thou haue but a little, bee not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid
to giue a little almes.</hi> And
so a little of thys oyle of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie,
shall more and more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound,
beeing increased with
the augmentation of grace.</p>
                  <p>Furthermore, almes multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyeth
our temporall goods,<note place="margin">Lib. 18. Moral. c. 10</note> as
Gregory testifieth, saying: vve
loose earthly thinges by kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
them and preserue them
by giuing them away; And in
another place: vvhatsoeuer is
giuen to the poore, if it be well
considered, is not a gift, but a
lone, because that which is gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
is receiued again without all
hazard, or aduenture with ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage:
as for example,<note place="margin">1, Kings, 1<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

the widdowes oyle and meale
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:8182:55"/>
is increased, who nourished E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lias:
wherby it is manifest, that

                  <p>Thyrdly, because almes is a

as S. Ambrose testifieth, who

of man, which he cannot carry

co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panion of the dead. O how
good and necessary a compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
is almes for the deade?
Therefore do not despise such
a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panion, which like an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocate
goeth before thee, and
not followeth after; as those
wretches do contemne it, who
will not extend their almes in
theyr life time, beeing not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
to them that cause light to
be carrryed behind them, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
the Wise-man reprehendeth,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:8182:55"/>
saying: <hi>Say not vnto thy neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Prou, 3,</note> 
                     <hi>Goe and come againe, and

                  <p>Hee that is rich ought to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
three things in giuing his
almes,<note place="margin">Three thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges to be considered in almes.</note> the first of the which is:
that it is God that requireth the
almes, &amp; that he will haue that
mercy in the same account, as
if it were done to himselfe, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to that, vvhich Christ
sayth in the Gospell:<note place="margin">Math, 25,</note> 
                     <hi>That
which yee haue doone vnto one of
the least of these my bretheren,
yee haue doone it vnto mee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>GOD dooth begge of the
rich money for the poore, of
whom the rich daily desire the
kingdom of heauen. He ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
that denyeth almes to the
poore, God requiring it, it is
greatly to be feared, least God
in lyke manner denie vnto him
the kingdome of heauen, and
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:8182:56"/>
that he will not heare him, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
he cryeth, according to that of
Salomon in his Prouerbs:<note place="margin">Prouerb, 21</note> 
                     <hi>Hee
that stoppeth his eare at the cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the poore, he shall also cry,
and not bee heard.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The second thing that a rich
man ought to thinke of, bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
about to giue almes, is, that
almightie GOD dooth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
that for the poore, which
is his owne, seeing that hee is
the Lorde of all those thinges,
which wee possesse; therefore
hee is without doubt most in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratefull,
that denyeth necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
almes vnto the poore.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Dauid was farre of from
thys ingratitude, when he said:</hi>
Might, and power, and glorie,
and victorie, and prayse (ô Lord)
are thine. For all things that are
in heauen, and in earth are thine:
Thine is thy kingdome O Lorde,
and thou art aboue all Princes,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:8182:56"/>
Riches and honour are thine. All
thinges are thine, and wee giue
vnto thee, that which wee haue
receiued at thine hands.</p>
                  <p>And thys cogitation ought
the more to mooue vs vnto
almes, because GOD recey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
what we giue, and dooth
repay vs not onely our princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall,
but an hundred fold. This
is that, which Saint Augustine
saith:<note place="margin">Augustine in his Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles.</note> If thou wilt bee a good
Merchant, and a gainefull V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surer;
gyue that vvhich thou
canst not keepe, that thou
mayst receiue what thou canst
not loose. Gyue a little, that
thou mayst receiue an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
folde, giue a temporall
&amp; fading possession, that thou
maist receiue an euerlasting in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearitance.</p>
                  <p>Therfore he is not onely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratefull,
but also madde, who
dooth not giue vnto God his
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:8182:57"/>
reuenues, that he may receiue
them againe with so great inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest:
when as both the Iewes,
the Ethnicks, and the Moores,
willingly doe it. Wherfore my
deere Brother repent, and ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and lay vp the treasuries of
mercy in a safe place, in celesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
securitie, and not among
earthly dangers. Consider that
the hart of a couetous man, is a
pytte vvithout a bottome; the
more it receiueth, the more it
desireth, neyther is at any time
satisfied as the Wiseman sayth:
<hi>A couetous man is not satisfied
with money.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Eccles. 11.</note> Woe be vnto them
that lay vp their treasures in the
earth: for theyr hearts are af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted,
because they cannot
enioy theyr riches, and they
keepe them with danger, and
will they, nill they, they must
at the last part from them, and
suffer punishment in hell.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="85" facs="tcp:8182:57"/>Lay vp thy treasure my deer
and good brother, in thine own
Countrey, which is Heauen,
where thou shalt liue alwayes,
and neuer haue hope to enioy
these, which are to bee left in
the earth: perswade thy selfe
that those are thy goods, which
thou hast layde out &amp; bestow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
on the poore; for those are
not properly thy goods which
thou canst not carry with thee.
Heare what S. Ambrose saith:<note place="margin">Ambrose in his offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</note>
Nothing dooth so much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
a Christian, as commise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
and charity. And saint
Ierome sayth:<note place="margin">Hiero. to Nepotia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus.</note> I doe not reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
that I haue read, that any
one dyed an euill death, vvho
willingly exercised the workes
of charity. For they haue the
prayers of many, and it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
but that theyr prayers
shoulde bee heard. And Leo
commending this vertue, saith;
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:8182:58"/>
Hee shall receiue many great
blessings at Gods hands,<note place="margin">Leo of the apparition of our lord.</note> who
letteth not the poore depart
from him without comfort.</p>
                  <p>Mercy is of so great vertue,
that without it, others doe not
any whitte profit. Bee it that
thou art faithful, sober, &amp; chast,
&amp; adorned with vvorthier ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles,
yet if thou beest not merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
thou shalt finde no mercy.
And this may bee enough to
moue the mindes of men, that
they may readily &amp; cheerfully
take vpon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this third part of
repentance, which is Satis-fac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Of this repentance, that
we may return to our purpose,
our Sauiour sayth; <hi>He that ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
not vp his crosse &amp; followeth
me, is not worthy of me.</hi> Which
if it be true, we are to performe
our repentance as speedily as
may be, yea in our youth: for
then it is more profitable vnto
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:8182:58"/>
vs, &amp; more acceptable to God,
as the wise man teacheth, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;

them as the waues of the

                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="88" facs="tcp:8182:59"/>It is euill, because it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie
to reason and iustice:<note place="margin">It is wicked and naught, to promise vnto thy selfe a lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger life.</note>
worse, because it is against the
sinner himselfe: but it is most
vile, vngodly, and cursed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it warreth and fighteth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the diuine will. That it
is euill, &amp; contrary to reason &amp;
iustice, is proued by three ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> First, it is against iustice, if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
one hauing many horses, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
which hee may deuide
the weightie and heauie bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,
will lay the whole vveight
vpon one, which is the weakest
and the oldest. Such an one is
he, that reserueth for feeble old
age the vvhole burthen of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
&amp; all the sins which
hee committed in his youth,
which is vnsufficient for the
burden, and can by no meanes
beare it. Of such Saint Isidore
sayth: They that mispend the
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:8182:59"/>
time of repentance vvithout
fruite, in vaine desire of the
Lord, that the gate may bee o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
vnto them. The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
Malachie denounceth a
curse against such an one.<note place="margin">Malach. 1,</note> 
                     <hi>Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
be the deceiuer,</hi> saith he, <hi>that
hath in his flocke a male, &amp; vow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
and sacrificeth vnto the Lord
a corrupt thing.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly hee seemeth vnto <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/>
mee, more foolish and more
vniust, who when he is strong
and healthfull, will not carry a
small burden, but had rather
stay, till his burden bee greater,
and himselfe weaker. Such an
one is he, that doth not carrie
the burde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of repentance in his
youth, and so long as it is light
and little: but putteth it of to
olde age, when as hee himselfe
shall be weaker, &amp; his burden
wayghtier. Wee haue an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
of this in the booke of
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:8182:60"/>
the Fathers: One cutting
downe wood, bound vp a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
of it, and then made tryall
whether he could carry it, but
seeing himselfe not able to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
the same, he cut down more
wood, and made him a greater
burden, and by how much hee
was lesse able to lift it vp, by so
much he augmented it. After
the same manner doe sinners,
who deferring the time of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
do encrease the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
of their sinners.</p>
                  <p>For as S. Gregory saith:<note place="margin">Gregory.</note> the
sinne that is not foorth-with
clensed and purged by repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
doth drawe on another
with his weight. Thirdly, is
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/> not hee exceeding vniust and
madde, that bestoweth &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumeth
all the time of hys lyfe,
all his cost, &amp; all his diligence,
in building of houses, in which
notwithstanding hee is not
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:8182:60"/>
minded to dwell: but dooth
pull downe with all his might
and maine the house, which he
hath determined to inhabite?
Certainly, this man altogether
worketh against the iudgment
of reason, and is worthy to bee
counted both a foole &amp; a mad
man. Thys doth a sinner, who
proroging his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uersion to the
howre of death, buildeth for
himselfe a habitation in the
depth of hell, where notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
hee desireth not to
dwell. Feare and dreade there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
that auncient saying: Hee
that dooth any thing against
his own conscience, buildeth in
hell.</p>
                  <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Hope of a longer life, is worse the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the former circu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>stances in respect of the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner himself.</note> in hope of a lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
life, something worse see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
to be, then that hath been
spoken, when it is to the preiu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice
of the sinner himself. And
this is proued by two exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ples.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="92" facs="tcp:8182:61"/>The first is, because if any
man had rather bee sicke, then
sound: a seruaunt, then free:
poore, then endued with some
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>petent wealth: such an one
should be opposite and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to himselfe. A sinner is
like to this man, because he had
rather liue, nay lye dead in sin,
which is a spirituall sicknes &amp;
infirmity, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be whole, strong,
and sound. Wherefore a sinner
is more cruel against himselfe;
for he had rather be dead then
aliue; sick, then sound; a ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunt,
then free: as it is in S.
Iohn:<note place="margin">Iohn, 8,</note> 
                     <hi>Who soeuer committeth
sinne, is the seruant of sinne.</hi> And
S. Augustine saith:<note place="margin">August. in his 4. booke of the cittie of God.</note> A good
man, albeit he serue, yet hee is
free; but an euil man, although
he raigne, yet is he a seruaunt:
neyther of one man alone, but
(that which is more grieuous)
of so many maisters as he hath
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:8182:61"/>
vices. The second example is,
he is a debter, who taketh any
summe of money vpon vsury;
for by so much more doth hys
debt &amp; vsury increase, by how
much he is longer in discharg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it; and to bee so much the
more negligent in repaying it,
by how much hee is lesse suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
to repay, certainly it is
hurtfull &amp; vnprofitable to him
selfe: Such an one is a sinner,
who perseuering in his sinnes,
the longer hee continueth in
them, the more hee increaseth
the vsury of hys faulte: and so
much the more punishment
shall he at the length suffer for
them. Herevpon S. Iohn saith
in his Reuelation;<note place="margin">Apoc, 18,</note> 
                     <hi>Inasmuch as
she glorified her selfe, and liued in
pleasure, so much giue yee to her
torment and sorrow.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, we sayd, that the
perswasion of a longer life was
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:8182:62"/>
most vile,<note place="margin">The per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion of a longer life, is most vile, and vngodly.</note> vngodly, and cursed,
especially, because it directlie
fighteth against the goodnesse
of our Lord Iesus Christ: and
this is manifested by three ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> the first of which is: If
a seruant be disobedient to his
maister, throgh the whole race
and course of his life, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
he is bounde to
serue faythfully, hauing recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
many benefits of him: &amp;
should serue the greatest ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie
that his maister hath, and
at the length at the end of hys
life, when his strength is decay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
shoulde returne vnto his
maister, to waite vpon him, to
whom alwaies heeretofore he
hath been immorigerous, dost
thou thinke that this seruice
would be accepted of his mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster?
Such an one is a sinner,
who after he hath offended his
Lord God all his life time, and
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:8182:62"/>
hath borne arms vnder the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours
of his aduersary, would at
the last return to the seruice of
God in his faint &amp; feeble olde
age. Seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dly, if any one had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued
mony, or other great ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/>
of his Lord, on this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>diti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that he should negociate &amp;
traffick therwith, &amp; by his dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
should increase the sum:
and he in despight of his Lord
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sumeth the mony vainely &amp;
prodigally; without doubt he
offendeth both the goodnesse
of his Lord, and hindereth his
own profit, &amp; should be coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
very vnthankful. A sinner
is not vnlike to such an one,
who hauing receiued of God a
soule &amp; a body, with al the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
powers, externall goods,
length of dayes, &amp; many other
benefites, dooth vnprofitably
consume them all, and squan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
them abroade: and that to
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:8182:63"/>
the reproch and iniurie of his
Lord, Creator, and Redeemer:
by sinning sundry and diuers
wayes, by offending the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of GOD; and by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
hauocke of all his goods,
but chiefely of his soule, which
is committed and commended
vnto him, as a most precious
treasure. Wherfore, S. Grego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
sayd; Woe be vnto mee, if
I shall negligently keepe the
talent committed to me of the
Lorde, that is, my soule, redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
with the precious bloode
of that immaculate lambe, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
also, that there is not any
moment of time, which I am
not to giue an account of.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/> The thyrd example. If any
one be a Steward, whose dutie
is, to dispose the goods of hys
Lord: if hee shoulde giue the
best bread, the best vvine, and
the best meates to strangers, &amp;
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:8182:63"/>
to the enemies of his Lord; &amp;
should sette before his Lorde
mustie bread, vnsauory meats,
putrified flesh, corrupted fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shes,
and dead vvine: doe you
not thinke that this seruaunt
should badly fitte the humour
of his Lord? A wretched sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
is like to such an one, vvho
offereth to the worlde, and to
the deuill, who are the enemies
of Christ Iesus his lord, the best
and fairest flower of his youth
and strength: and to his God
and lord, the worst part of his
lyfe, barren and vnprofitable
old age. Dauid did not so, who
saith of himselfe;<note place="margin">Psalm, 38,</note> 
                     <hi>I will keep my
strength for thee ô Lorde.</hi> And
the Wise man sayth, that from
his youth hee sought for wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
<note place="margin">Wised, 8.</note> vvhich is true vertue.
But of all them that deferre re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
<note place="margin">Gregory in his morals.</note> Saint Gregory saith:
Hee is farre enough of from
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:8182:64"/>
fayth, vvho expecteth old age
to repent in. For it is to be fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
least while hee hopeth for
mercy, he fall into iudgement.
For not any day is within hys
power, &amp; therefore euery one
ought to follow the counsel of
Isidore, and conuert hymselfe
with all the diligence and hast
hee can, vnto the Lord; for if
hee lynger and loyter, he shall
at the length bee willing, but
not able to turne himselfe.</p>
                  <p>Which things beeing so, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent

                  <p>Therefore ô sinner flie from

<pb n="102" facs="tcp:8182:66"/>
worlde, first, because it leaueth
thee in so great neede and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery.
For as the Apostle Saint
Iames saith; <hi>The amity of this
world,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Iames, 4,</note> 
                     <hi>is the enmity of God. Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer

<note place="margin">Vpon the 7. chapter of Mich.</note> according to the expositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

house of confusion, vvhich is
this world, in which confusion
raigneth euery where, as well in
the Clergy as in the Layitie, as
well in olde, as young, as well in
men, as women. Therefore it is
very well sayd of Saint Iohn in
his generall Epistle;<note place="margin">1, Iohn, 5,</note> 
                     <hi>The whole
worlde lyeth in wickednesse.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Saint Bernard also counsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
vs very well,<note place="margin">Of conuersion vnto the Clergy. chap, 30,</note> saying: Flye
out of Babylon, flye and saue
your soules. Fly to the Citties
of refuge, where ye may both
repent for sins past, and for the
present finde grace, and safely
looke for future glorie. Let not
the anguish and remorse of
your sins hinder you, nor the
austeritie of repentance deter
and afright you. For neither
the passions of this time, nor
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:8182:67"/>
the trybulation of thys world
are woorthy, for the fault past,
which is remitted; for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
grace of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>solation which
is bestowed; nor for the future
glory, which is promised. To
be briefe, there is no bitternesse
so great, vvhich the Prophets
meale will not sweeten, which
the wisedom of the tree of lyfe
will not make sauory. Wee are
to knowe, that the worlde is to
be eschewed for foure causes,
the first of which is,<note place="margin">The world is to bee e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>schewed for 4 causes.</note> because
wise and circumspect men, are
wont to flie and auoyd infecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and contagious places, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially
if they be weake and
sickly, or feare any infirmitie.
Such a place is the VVorlde,
which hath in it many euills, &amp;
many diseases of sin, we see also
much filthines, &amp; many blemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shes
in it, which co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>taminate &amp;
pollute our soules: for sinne it
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:8182:67"/>
selfe is a contagious disease,
therefore not without cause we
ought to eschew &amp; auoyd the
societie and company of wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
and vngodlie men; for it
is not meet, that the whole and
sounde should dwell with the
leaprous and diseased: for the
Wise man saith: <hi>Hee that tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth
pitch, shall be defiled with
it, and he that companieth with a
proude man, shal put on pride.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Certainly saith S. Ierom, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
dooth so hurte a man as
naughty company,<note place="margin">Tom. 9. Epi. Euseb. ad Damasum de morte Hieron.</note> and euil so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety.
For a man becomes such
a one, as the company he kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth.
The Wolfe dooth neuer
dwel with the lamb: &amp; a chast
man doth flie the company of
the luxurious. I think it impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible,
that a man shoulde long
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinue honest, who daily vseth
the societie of wicked me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. <hi>With
the holy, thou shalt be holy,</hi> sayth
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:8182:68"/>
the Psalmist, <hi>with the innocent,
thou shalt be innocent, and with
the frowarde, thou shalt learne
frowardnes.</hi> For as euill compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
hurteth, so good company
profiteth. Nothing can bee
compared to thys treasure. He
that findeth good society, fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
life, and aboundeth with
wealth. I speake truly and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently;
a man is made verie
sildome eyther good or euill,
but through company &amp; soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety.
The hart of a chyld, is said
to bee as a Table in which no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
is paynted. Therefore
that he receiueth from compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
hee keepeth till his old age,
whether it bee good or euill.
These things spake S. Ierome,
beeing ready to yeelde vp the
ghost. Therfore seeing that the
worlde is so euill, wee ought to
eschewe and auoyde it, as an ill
neighbour, who can worke vs
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:8182:68"/>
great mischiefe by hys neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhoode
and vicinitie, and
hurte vs very much by sinnes
and sinners, of vvhich it is full.</p>
                  <p>The second cause vvhy the
worlde is to be eschewed,<note place="margin">The second cause why the world is to be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>schewed.</note> is,
because vvise and considerate
men doe auoyde those places,
in which they feare the intrap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pings
and snares of theyr ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
least they fall into theyr
hands: and thys is the revvard
that the world rendereth vnto
her louers, that shee at the
length deliuereth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> into the
hands of the deuils theyr dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
enemies. The wordes of the
the traytour Iudas are to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
hether, saying to them,
to whom hee sold and betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Sonne of God:<note place="margin">Math, 26,</note> 
                     <hi>Whom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer
I shall kisse,</hi> and say peace
be vnto thee, <hi>that is he, lay hold
on him.</hi> VVhich vvordes the
world saith also to the deuils: to
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:8182:69"/>
vvhomsoeuer I shall gyue the
kisse of peace, of riches, of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
and honors, lay holde on
him, binde him hand &amp; foote,
and cast him into hell. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
S. Gregory saith not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
good cause;<note place="margin">Gregory in his morrals.</note> It is a mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest
signe of perdition, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the
effect and euent, dooth fauour
affected iniquitie, and no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarietie
dooth hinder, what the
peruerse minde hath co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceiued.
And Saint Ierome sayth: It is
a manifest token of damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
to bee loued of the vvorld,
to enioy prosperity, &amp; to haue
all things, what the vvill desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth.</p>
                  <p>Certaine therefore it is, that
they are exceedingly deceiued
in finding out the way to feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie,
who thinke that they may
enter into glory, and into the
kingdome of heauen, by riches
and pleasures.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="109" facs="tcp:8182:69"/>The third cause,<note place="margin">The thyrd cause.</note> why vvee
ought to eschew the worlde, is
this, because wise &amp; wary men
doe flie &amp; auoyde dangerous
places, such as the sea is, wherin
we saile with feare. Whervpon
the Wise-man saith;<note place="margin">Ecclus, 9</note> 
                     <hi>They that
saile ouer the sea, doe tell of the
dangers of it.</hi> Dauid certifieth
vs,<note place="margin">The worlde is a sea.</note> that thys world is a great &amp;
spacious sea, in which the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
parte of the marriners per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish.
Thys is manifest, because
as Bernard saith, many do mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carry
in it, and fewe are saued.
The worlde is as an Ocean, in
which of foure shyps, scarcelie
one is saued; as the Deluge, in
vvhich so many thousand men
were drowned, and so fewe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scaped:
and as the Fornace of
Babylon kindled with hell fire,
in which a man is sette on a
light flame with one word of
the fire of vvrath, in vvhich
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:8182:70"/>
luxury dooth burne, and coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousnes
is inflamed by the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
looke and aspect.</p>
                  <p>The fourth cause, vvhy we
ought to forsake the world,<note place="margin">The fourth cause,</note> is,
because euery man that is wise,
beeing admonished, ought to
eschew that place, in which his
mortal &amp; deadly enemy dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth.
Thys place is the vvorld,
which the deuill our capitall e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemie
inhabiteth; hee hath his
signory and dominion in thys
world, who alwayes threatneth
destruction vnto vs, and thyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steth
for our deathes. Therfore
let vs flye from the worlde, as
from the deuill, according to
the counsell of the VViseman,
<hi>Keep thee far from the man that
hath power to slay.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ecclus, 9,</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>These reasons thus beeing
sette before our eyes, let vs bee
wise: for we see manifestly by
these things which haue beene
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:8182:70"/>
spoken, that the world cannot
be better ouercome by any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
way, then by flying from
it. VVee haue an example of
thys in the lifes of the Fathers,
of Achrimus, who being Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour,
&amp; standing in his pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace,
prayed thus vnto GOD.
Lord I desire thee, shewe vnto
me the way of saluation. And
behold, hee heard a voyce say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
vnto him; Achrimus, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoyde
the concourse and so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnities
of the worlde, entan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
not thy selfe in the snares of
humaine vanities, &amp; thou shalt
be safe. At the hearing of which
voyce, hee betooke himselfe
foorth-with to a strict solitarie
course of lyfe. And saying an
other time the same prayer, he
hearde a voyce saying: Fly, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uercome,
bee silent &amp; at rest.
And surely these be the rootes,
and the grounds not to sinne.
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:8182:71"/>
For by flying, the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cupiscence
of the flesh is ouercome, by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
silent, the pride of lyfe, and
by beeing of a peaceable and
quiet mind, couetousnesse, &amp;
greedines of gaine are subdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and ouerthrowne.</p>
                  <p>Saint Isidore admonishing
vs that wee shoulde contemne
the world, sayth: If thou desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
to lyue quietly, couet no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
that is in this world: cast
fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thee what-soeuer may hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
thy holy purpose. Be dead
to the world, and therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
deade, doe not thyrst after
glory, and thou shalt lyue in
tranquilitie and rest, being co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
with thine owne. Despise
that in thy life, which thou
canst not keepe in thy death.
S. Augustine speaketh thus of
this deceitfull world:<note place="margin">August. in his medita.</note> This life
is a miserable life, a fraile life, an
vncertaine life, a painefull life,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:8182:71"/>
an impure lyfe, a lyfe Lady of
enormities, &amp; Queen of pride,
ful of miseries &amp; errors: which
is not to be called a life, but a
death in which wee die dailie,
through sundry defections of
mutability, and by manifolde
kinds of death. A brickle lyfe,
an inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>stant life, which the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
it goeth on, the nerer it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procheth
to death, a deceitfull
and vnsteady life, full of the
snares of death. Although it be
replenished with these, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
greeuances, sorrowes, and
inconueniences, yet (ô greefe)
howe many dooth it ensnare
with vanities, and howe many
are deceiued with false and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfull
promises? And albeit
of it selfe it is so false and bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
that it cannot co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceale these
inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ueniences from her blinde
louers, yet it maketh drunk an
infinite multitude of fooles
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:8182:72"/>
with the golden cup, which she
beareth in her hand. As they
are happy, so are they rare, that
refuse her familiarity; that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spise
her perfunctory ioyes:
that contemne her society, least
with this perishing deceiuer
they bee also forced to perrish.
This sayth he. Beholde, sayth
Bernard,<note place="margin">Bernard.</note> the worlde cryeth, I
shall fayle thee; and the flesh
crieth, I shal infect thee: which
then, ô miserable sinner, vvilt
thou follow? the failing world,
or the infecting flesh? Both of
them are euill: therefore fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe
Christ, who will refresh
thee. But if all these thinges,
my Brother, which thou hast
hetherto read of, do not moue
thee, heare what the same fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
Doctor of the Church,
Bernard sayth, of the louers of

<pb n="115" facs="tcp:8182:72"/>
saith he, for whom is prepared
intollerable sorrow, incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable

Woe bee to them, for whom is

horrible tortures, and terrible
&amp; fearefull deuils: where they
shal cal &amp; seeke for death, but
shal not find it: where there is
no order, but where perpetual
horror euerlastingly abideth.
How great feare, how great so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,
how great mourning will
there be, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> sinners are sepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the righteous, &amp; deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered

to see the face of the Lorde, or
heauenly glory: without any
hope to bee euer freed from
those torments; where ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the torturers shal be wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried,

                  <p>Tell mee ô sinner,<note place="margin">Ierom vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the 17, of Mathew.</note> sayth S.

the strength of Samp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,

                  <p>The shortnesse of time, the

<pb n="117" facs="tcp:8182:73"/>
thee to contemne the worlde,

the sinnes of pride and

                     <hi>What
is your life? it is euen as a vapour

                  </p>
                  <p>And Saint Augustine sayth,<note place="margin">August. vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the 56. psalme.</note>
If thou haddest lyued all that
time, since Adam was expelled
out of the garden of Paradice,
euen to this day, certainly thou
shouldest well perceiue, that
thy life was not perpetuall,
vvhich hath so passed avvay:
but the lyfe of one man what
is it? adde as many yeeres as it
pleaseth thee, adde a very long
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:8182:74"/>
and lasting old age, what then?
Is it not yet morning? Bee it
that the day of Iudgement is
farre of; assuredly thy last day
cannot bee farre of, therefore
nowe prepare thy selfe; for as
thou departest out of thys life,
so shalt thou bee presented to
the other lyfe. Thys sayth hee.
And in another place: All the
time that wee liue heere, is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
from life: so that the lyfe
present is none other thing,
but a short way, by which wee
passe vnto death,<note place="margin">Seneca in his 59. e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistle.</note> in which no
man can long stay nor linger,
or walke softly, and at leysure;
but euery day thou must finish
by little and little some part of

                  <p>All things passe away, sayth
Soneca, and are in continuall
diminution &amp; augmentation.
None of vs is the same in olde
age, that wee vvere in youth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="119" facs="tcp:8182:74"/>Not any one of vs is the same

passe away after the manner of

steadie of all those thinges vve

in the third chapter of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecie

with the foules of heauen,
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:8182:75"/>
and hoarded vp siluer and golde,
wherein men trust, and made none
end of their gathering? For they
that coyned siluer, and were so

man from him that is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed.
Wherfore my brother,
let vs be wise at the last, being
admonished by this Scripture:
and let vs assuredly persvvade
our selues that all mans glory,
whence soeuer it commeth, is
to be auoided of vs.<note place="margin">Why world<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly felicity is to be es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chewed.</note> First: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
of his owne nature it is
vile: secondly, because it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfull
in his promises: third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
because it is vaine, brickle,
frayle, fleeting and momenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny:
fourthly, because it is euill
and malicious in rendering a
reward. First I say, that mans
glory is to be eschewed, because
of his owne nature and condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:8182:76"/>
is vile and base; as it is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest
in the first booke of the
Macchabees, where Mattathi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
dying sayth to his Sonnes;
<hi>Feare not yee the wordes of a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
man;<note place="margin">1, Macca. 2.</note> for his glory is but dong
and vvormes.</hi> VVhat in this
world is more filthy the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> dong?
What more vile then wormes?
Therefore if all mans glorie
consisteth in dong, it is not to
be desired, but auoyded. Mans
glorie,<note place="margin">A simily.</note> as the Phylosopher
sayth, is as corruption and the
rottennesse of vvood. Which
thing also experience teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
vs: for as the little vvorme
<hi>Teredo,</hi> that eateth vvood, in
the night shyneth, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
a crackling, but in the
day time is knovvne to bee a
worme &amp; putrefaction: so also
vayne glory shineth and glitte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
vvith great pompe in the
night of this world to weak &amp;
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:8182:77"/>
dimme eyes, vvhich cannot
iudge but by outward appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances.
But when that cleare
and bright day of iudgement
shall come, wherein God shall
reueale the darkest and obscu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
thinges of our soules, and
shall manifest the secret coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sailes
of our harts: then those,
that seemed happy and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
shall be knowne to be fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy,
vile, and without any hope
of saluation. Wherefore these
mighty me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> are like vnto Owls,
which flying in the darke doe
seeme to cast some light from
them, but when the day ariseth
they show blacke, as they are.
If these gloriosoes had eyes to
looke into theyr most vile ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
and to behold the stinch
and corruption of their owne
flesh, which shall be turned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
ashes, they that are nowe
swelled and puffed vp, and doe
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:8182:77"/>
despise others, through the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blenes
of their birth, theyr po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
and dignity, should well
perceaue hovve abiect, base,
blacke, and corrupt they are.
Wherefore I cannot be indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,
to thinke otherwise, but
that if they would deeply con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
and weigh these thinges,
they would presently cast out
of their harts al the earthly glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of this world:<note place="margin">In an Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle to Iulia. chap. 4.</note> knowing, as
Hierome saith, that it is impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible,
that any one should be
happy in both worlds, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare
glorious both in heauen,
and in earth.</p>
                  <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">The glory of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world is vncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant.</note> the glory of thys
world (as we sayde) is to be es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chewed,
because it is fraile, and
without any co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>stancy or foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation:
therfore it is like vnto
a smoke, or a vapour, which the
higher that it is lifted, the lesse
it is seene: and to a flower of a
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:8182:78"/>
good sent and fairenes, which a
little Sun-shyne dooth dry vp
in a short time; is vvithered
with a little blast of wind, and
dooth loose all the beauty and
fragrancy. Such is the glory
of the vvorld, of vvhich Esaias
sayde: <hi>All flesh is grasse, and all
the grace and glory thereof is as
the flower of the field.<note place="margin">Esay, 40.</note> The grasse
withereth, the flower fadeth, and
the glorie thereof passeth away.</hi>
Such are the louers of thys
temporall momentany glory:
vvorthily compared to grasse,
vvhich grovveth on the topps
of houses to day greene, and to
morrow not seene. VVhere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Wiseman sayth:<note place="margin">Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus, 10.</note> 
                     <hi>All
power is of short continuance; and
hee that is a King to day, to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
is dead.</hi> Tell me where is
the povver and glory of King
Assuerus, vvho gouerned an
hundred and tvventy prouin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces?
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:8182:78"/>
VVhere is the glorie of
great Alexander, at whose pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
the vvhole earth vvas
husht,<note place="margin">1, Maccha. 1</note> to vvhom all Kings and
Tyrants payed tribute, as it is
in the first Booke of the Mac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chabees?
VVhere is the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
of that great Empyre, by
vvhich he conquered and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued
vnder him almost all the
Kingdomes of the vvorlde?
Where are all the Princes and
Potentates of the vvorld, vvho
raigned ouer both man and
beast? They are passed and
gone avvay, as a straunger or a
Soiournour that tarryeth but
for one day. Trulie not one of
them remaineth, all their dayes
vvere spente in vanitie, and
theyr yeares svviftly posted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvay.</p>
                  <p>Death feareth no man: it swe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth
all avvay without any dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
or partiality: it is a
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:8182:79"/>
fierce cruell beast, that spareth
not any body, it taketh avvay
both the king and the begger,
and maketh all equal &amp; alike.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">The glory of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world is deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.</note> the glory of thys
world is to be auoided, because
it is deceitfull, and dooth per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
none of those thinges it
promiseth, but deceaueth all
men in this life. Which of the
Princes, and Emperours hath it
not deluded, promising vnto
them long life, peaceable ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours,
a quiet empire, when as
it cannot prolong mans lyfe
one houre? VVho in earthly
glory was lyke vnto Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
who was neuer subdued in
any warre, who alwayes trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phed
ouer his enemies, vvho
ouerthrew huge hoasts with a
litle army, who neuer besieged
Citty, but he tooke it, neyther
was there any prouince, which
did not obey his Empire? But
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:8182:79"/>
now when he seemed an abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
conquerour, and purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to passe the rest of his time
in peace and tranquillity, hee
vvas on a suddaine poysoned.
Tell mee why doest thou fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
and hunt after the glory of
the world, which cannot suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour
thee in death?</p>
                  <p>Fourthly (as I said) humaine
glory and applause is to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoyded
and eschewed,<note place="margin">The glory of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world is euill and malicious in retribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> because
it is a very euill and naughty
pay-mayster: for it promiseth
glory, and payeth euerlasting
perdition, and eternall confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.
Wherfore the Lord saith
by the Prophet; <hi>I will turne
their glory into shame.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ose, 4.</note> So theyr
strength shall bee turned into
weakenes, their wisedome into
foolishnes, and their pleasures
into punishments. For accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the quantity of the falt,
shall be the quantity of the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment,
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:8182:80"/>
vvhich they shall be
tormented vvith. Heereupon
Saint Hierome speaketh thus
to the louers of this fleeting
and deceitfull vvorld; Woe
bee vnto you miserable vvret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
vvho endeuour to goe to
heauen by the vvay of riches
and pleasures, and vnderstand
not vvhat our Sauiour sayth:
<hi>That it is easier for a cammell to
goe through the eye of a needle,<note place="margin">Math. 19.</note>
then for a rich man to enter into
the kingdome of heauen.</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
that this is a Diuine
sentence, and the words of him
who sayth; <hi>Heauen and earth
shall passe, but my words shall not
passe.</hi> O miserable vvretches,
and more inconstant then any
wind; howle &amp; mourne; who
are onely great and noble by
the benefit of fortune; but in
deed are base, abiect and blind
vvith the smoake of vanitie,
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:8182:80"/>
with deceaueable honours, and
false dignities of this vvorlde.
Doe yee not see the shortnes
of time, howe death perhaps
this might shal cut off the thred
of your liues, and that yee shall
be tormented for euer in hell,
vvhere yee shall alwayes liue,
dying without end, yea more
dying, then all the men that
die in the world? vvhere no rest
shall be giuen, but torments
shall alwayes liue to reuenge?
Where yee shall not onely be
tortured with men, but also
with deuils? For so much the
greater shall thy punishment
be there, as thy glory was grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
here, &amp; as thou hast liued in
greater delicacies and delights.
See how our Sauiour, that vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gable
truth, al whose deeds
&amp; words are one instruction,
amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g his twelue apostles, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
he choose, would haue but one
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:8182:81"/>
Bartholomew a noble man, &amp;
one Matthew a rich man: hee
chose all the other poore men,
and fishers: that he might sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie
that the noble and rich
men of this world, can hardly
be saued, and be made worthy
of heauen. For if by one one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
sinne man became guilty of
hell fire: how shall a rich man
be saued, desirous and greedy
of populer applause, hunting
after the fraile and mortall glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of this life, which is none o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
thing, then a filthy &amp; im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure
vessell and receite for all
sinne, full of pride and luxury,
full of couetousnes in the rich,
mighty and noble men of this
world? These are theeues, that
robbe the poore of that they
should liue by, vvho eate vp
their labours, killing and trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
them vnder theyr feete:
vvhen notvvithstanding God
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:8182:81"/>
hath blessed them vvith great
aboundance of vvealth, that
they therby might nourish the
poore, and religiously rule o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
them; who being drowned
in riches, and delicats, and swol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len
with costly meates, seeing
the poore before their Pallace
gates naked, and perrishing
through hunger and cold, doe
not stretch out their hands vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
them, neyther are mooued
vvith any pittie: but gyuing
themselues vvholie to playes,
sportings, gamings, feastings,
and banquets, vtterly forget the
poore, the charge of whom is
so often committed and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
neither doe they remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
God at any time, except
perhaps lightly and by the way
cursorily &amp; perfunctorily. Let
them certainly perswade them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues,
and remember these
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:8182:82"/>
things, when they shall feele &amp;
try them, that a most strict and
exact aceount shal be required
of them, vvhy they haue not
destributed to the poore those
things, which were superflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
vnto them: and if they
cannot giue an account, nor
purge themselues, their soules
shall suffer intollerable tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
in the deepest pit of hel.
O how easily doe they offend,
and howe suddainly are they
envvrapped in punishment,
vvho doe not consider, hovve
they must dye, or howe God
shall iudge them? O how vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circumspect
and vnhappy are
they, that do not reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber these
thinges, and doe not resist the
temptations of the deuil: I dare
boldly affirme, that if they did
acknowledge God to be their
Iudge, &amp; think that they shold
die, that they wold not sinne, at
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:8182:82"/>
the least with so great security,
all feare set apart. But now they
come to Church, not to heare
the diuine word, &amp; to pray, but
to see vanity, beuty, &amp; the pride
of wome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. This is their thought,
this their intent, &amp; this their ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon.
There they talk &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer,
how they may heape riches
together: there they dispute of
the sundry fashions of apparel:
there they inuite one another
to feasts &amp; banquets, &amp; to the
dishonest delights of gluttony:
of whom S Bernard sayth; O
wretches what do yee, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the time do slay your own
soules, &amp; corrupt and putrifie
your bodies? Tell me, whence
comes infirmity, whence gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth
the sodaine death of yong
men, but of great aboundance
of meats, &amp; immoderate vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry?
Wretched are ye because ye
think that ye can delude God,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:8182:83"/>
but in truth yee deceaue your
selues<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> because yee neglect your
soules that yee may pamper
your bodies; &amp; so yee destroy
them both, before the time ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynted.
Your pleasure and
reioycing shall continue but
that short time, yee liue, but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
death your bewaylings and
torments shall endure with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uils
in hell for euer and euer:
there shal be euerlasting shame
and confusion: there shal nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
be sumptuous banquets,
nor delicate wines: there with
the rich Glutton, who in thys
world fared delicatly, yee shall
craue a drop of cold water, and
it shall not be giuen vnto you:
for there no man gathereth, or
reapeth any thing, but that hee
hath sown in this world. What
then ô miserable man doest
thou? Why doest thou not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent?
Why doest thou not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:8182:83"/>
thy life? O hart harder
then a rocke, why doest thou
linger? Why doest thou de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre
repentance for thy sinns?
Why doest thou prorogue thy
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uersion? Behold how death
commeth, running swiftly to
carrie thee avvay: the deuill
standeth ready, to catch thy
soule, and the wormes greedily
expect thy flesh, which thou
hast fatted vvith so fine cates,
that they may haue more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundant
and more toothsom
foode. Doth not that horrible
and fearefull day of iudgment
come into thy mind, in vvhich
thou shalt not onely render a
most stricte account of thy
pride, gluttony, luxury, vayne
glory, vanity, and of thy time
vnprofitably spent; but also of
euery idle word? Beware that
thou fall not into that dreadful
condemnation, which the Son

Bernard, ô thou worldly sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
how farre thou wanderest
out of the way, if in this world
thou seekest for honours, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures,

death, and recouering agayne
bodilie health, haue not after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes
beene woorse in theyr
soules, then they were before.
This I am assured and altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
perswaded of, and I haue
learned it by long experience
and obseruation, that they that
alvvayes sinne vvithout anie
feare, and neuer in health will
sette sinne at defiance, nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
theyr pleasures, that
they sildome and very hardlie
haue an happy ende, as sayth
Saint Hierome. VVherefore
my Brother, if thou hast any
discretion, or if there bee anie
light of reason within thee, des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pise
and forsake the riches, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours,
and glorie of this world,
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:8182:87"/>
for his sake who created thee,
and who is ascended aboue all
things. VVhat shall it profit
thee, if thou gainest the whole
world, and loosest thy soule? I
knowe assuredly that the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours
and glory of this world
are impediments of grace, and
that which is worse, hinderers
of eternall saluation. For it is
no where reade, that euer any
man passed vnto eternall glory
by the pleasures and delights
of this world. O howe vaine
and false is the glory, vvhich
men hunt after, and desire one
of another, and not of God?
He that desireth to be prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
before all men, it is to bee
feared, least the higher hee as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cends,
the greater will bee his
fall. That Angell, was a Cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizen
and an inhabitant of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen,
who said; <hi>I will ascend into
heauen,<note place="margin">Esay, 14.</note> &amp; exalt my throne aboue
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:8182:87"/>
beside the starres of God: I will
sitte also vppon the mount of the
Congregation in the sides of the
North. I will ascend aboue the
height of the cloudes, and I will
bee like the most high:</hi> But hee
vvas made a deuill, and fell
into the deepest pitte of hell.
Therefore it is very well sayde
of Saint Augustine; O howe
happie is hee, vvhose heart
onelie burneth vvith a desire
of heauenlie glorie? Who is
not puffed vp in prosperitie,
nor cast downe in aduersitie?
Who as hee hath nothing in
the vvorlde, that hee loueth, so
hee hath nothing that hee fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth?
VVhat other thing is
the glory of this worlde, but a
tickling of the eares? O how
cursed is he, sayth Anselmus,
and ingratefull, that seeketh
for the glorie of thys vvorlde?
No honour is gotte vvithout
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:8182:88"/>
trouble, no dignitie vvithout
disturbance, no highnes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
vanity. Wherfore, my bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
if thou wouldest weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily
consider of the great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
that follovveth vvorldly
glorie, vvithout doubt thou
wouldest shunne and flie from
all the vanity of this vvorlde:
and thou vvouldest onely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
to enioy that celestiall bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude,
vvhich all the Saintes
haue obtayned by so great la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
and afflictions, and now
doe enioy with greater reioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing.</p>

sent away, whose presence was
pleasant vnto thee, whose sight
acceptable, and whose neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood
so familiar and thou
altogether alone enterest into
that vnknowne region, &amp; shalt

Who wil succour thee in a day

roaring Lyons greedy of theyr
pray? who shal comfort thee?
who shal helpe thee? who shal

shal be entertayned of Angels,
defended from the rage &amp; vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence

carried into the bosome of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham.
Of death and the way
of sinners in an other place al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
thus speaketh S. Bernard:
The death of sinners is excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
euil.<note place="margin">Bernard in Epist 106.</note> And heare why it is
exceeding euil: It is euil in the
losse of the worlde: vvorse in
the seperation of the flesh: but
worst of al in the double tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the vvorme, and of
fire. But of al it is exceeding
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:8182:97"/>
euil, because the soule shal bee
seperated from the Diuine a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect,
and with great confusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
shal bee for euer depriued
of the sight of God. Consider,
my deare brother, and marke,
that no man can eschew death,
neyther know the houre, nor
change the time appoynted of
God. But the death of the
righteous is good, for they rest
from their labours; better for

viewing in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues the digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of their soules, and glory of

The second shall bee theyr a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilitie,

felicitie, as for his ovvne.</p>
                  <p>And aboue all this, they shal
reioyce with an admirable ioy;
seeing almighty GOD, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
they entirely loue, more then
themselues, and whom God
loueth, more then they can
loue themselues. Therefore

and ioy beneath, ioy all about

them, on euery side, and euery
where full of ioy.</p>
                  <p>But as the righteous shall
reioyce by reason of so great
ioy and blessednesse: so on the
contrarie part, sinners shall be
tormented with vnspeakable
tortures. For as beautie, agili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
fortitude, libertie, health,
pleasure, and eternitie, is mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of reioycing vnto the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous:
so on the contrary part,
the vglines of sinne, the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
of it, imbecility, seruitude,
infirmitie, anxietie, and euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
death, shall with conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall
and most greeuous tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
afflict sinners. For that
securitie of eternitie, &amp; the life
which the righteous shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce
in, where they alwaies in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy
the good blessings of God,
shal doubtlesse be a very great
and a perpetuall punishment
vnto the wicked, in which they
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:8182:104"/>
shal alvvayes finde, that which
they shal more and more hate.
VVhat shal vvee say of vvise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome?
which as it shall bee a

so that, which the vvic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked

and confusion: the friendship
vvhich is ioyned with myrth
and reioycing in the righteous,
shal bee great discord and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction
vnto sinners: for they
shal haue great discord, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
with those creatures, which
they heeretofore loued in thys

haue the lyke with them. And
in the place of the power, that

from those torments in

are now for euer to lyue in
the societie of deuils. To bee
briefe, in stead of the eternall
and ineffable ioy of the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
the wicked shal bee filled
with exceeding sorrowe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they shal continually and
without end, suffer ineuitably
all those miseries, vvhich they
shal feele themselues compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed

                  <p>Briefely,<note place="margin">August. in his Manuel, chap, 15,</note> according to the
saying both of Saint Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine

reuerend Doctor Saint Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine;
O ioy aboue all ioy, for
a man to see the face of God,
who hath created, redeemed,
and glorified him: certainely
thys is the ioy of the Angels, &amp;
of the Saints. For as Saint Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory
saith; GOD is of so ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable
beautie, that the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,
who sitte vpon the Sun,
doe stil desire to see him.</p>
                  <p>There as Saint Augustine
sayth,<note place="margin">In the sixt chap. of his Manuell.</note> is neyther vvicked men
nor any kinde of wickednesse:
there is no aduersary, nor any

charitie, eternall praise and

                  <p>Hast thou heard, ô my soule,

incomparable and incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensible
is the light of that
heauenlie Cittie? O happy
ioy, ô true reioycing of the
Saints, who doe continuallie
beholde the face, and alvvayes
possesse the company of God
himselfe. Therfore, ô my soule,
let vs willingly relinquish the
desire of these earthly thinges,
let vs banish out of our hearts,
the ioy of euill thoughts, and
beeing inflamed with the loue
of that celestial and euerlasting
ioy, let vs returne and trauaile
towards the heauenly Cittie, in
which wee are written and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynted
Cittizens, as of the

                  <p>If thou demaundest howe
this may be,<note place="margin">August. in the 16. chap. of his Manuell.</note> or by what means
and helpe? Heare what I shal
say vnto thee: The matter is
put in the power of the willer
and dooer. The kingdome of
heauen suffereth violence; the
kingdome of heauen, ô man,
demaundeth none other price,
but thy selfe: for it is worth so
much as thou art: giue thy
selfe, and thou shalt haue it.
VVhy art thou troubled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the price? Remember
that Christ hath giuen him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
that hee might purchase
of GOD his Father a king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
for thee, so in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
giue thou thy selfe, that
thou mayst enioy this king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
and let not sinne raigne
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:8182:108"/>
in thy mortall body, but the
spirite for the obtaining of life.</p>
                  <p>O sinful soule, ô soule ful of

not yet mooue thee, which I
haue spoken of the excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
and immensitie of that hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly
ioy, which the elect of
God doe for euer enioy, that
thou maist purchase it for thy
selfe, both by repentance, and
by diuine grace: Consider, I
pray thee, with great dread &amp;
feare, the most miserable estate,
the intollerable paynes, and the
vnspeakeable torments of hel,
that obscure and diabolical cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
that by the horror and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
of this consideration, thou
mayst bee conuerted vvyth all
thine hart vnto the Lord.</p>
                  <p>Therefore wee must first
know,<note place="margin">The paines of hell shall be diuers.</note> that according to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersity
of sinnes, shal be the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rietie
of punishments. For as
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:8182:108"/>
Saint Gregory sayth: VVee

one fire in Hel,<note place="margin">In his 4. booke of dialog. cap. 43, and in the 9, book of his mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals, cha. 27</note> but al sinners

there, as he hath sinned
heere.</p>
                  <p>And as in this vvorlde vvee
are al vnder one Sunne,<note place="margin">A Simily.</note> yet we
do not feele the heate al alike,
because one is more hote, and
another lesse hote: so there in
that fire, there is not one man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner

what the diuersitie of bodies
dooth (for after one manner
the fire doth burne chaff, after
another woode, and after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
yron) that there dooth the
diuersity of sinnes: they haue
the same fire, and yet it dooth
not burne al the damned that
be therein alike.</p>
                  <p>That fire shalbe kindled with
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:8182:109"/>
the wrath of the Iudge, &amp; shal
burne euerlastingly, neither

                  </p>

of thys fire, Sebastian sayth:
That there is as great a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence

Saint Isidore sayth: In
hell there shal be a certaine ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure
shyning, by which the

not that they may reioyce in it,

whilst one seeth ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
<note place="margin">See Gregory in the 9, booke of his morals. chap, 49.</note> For then the vvicked shal
see those tormented with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
whom they haue inordinatelie
loued in this worlde, that they
may nowe suffer punishment
according to the qualitie of the
fault, and that that carnall loue
which was preferred before the
diuine loue, may bee punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
with like vengeance in
theyr sight.<note place="margin">Whether the damned doe see the Saints.</note> Thus also is a
doubt resolued, by which it
was wont to bee demaunded,
whether the damned do see the
glory of the Saints. To which
question Saint Gregory aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swereth
after this maner;<note place="margin">In his 40. hom. vpon the Euang.</note> That
sinners may be the more puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
and tormented, they shall
both see their glory who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they
haue despised, and shal be tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented
with theyr paine who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
they haue vnprofitably loued.
For it is to be supposed, that till
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:8182:110"/>
the last iudgement, the wicked
doe see the righteous in glory
and rest, that they seeing them
in ioy, may not onely bee tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented
with theyr owne pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
but with their blessed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes.
But the iust shal alwayes
behold in torments the vniust,
that hereby their ioyes may al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
increase, because they see
the euill from which by mercie
they are deliuered: and by so
much they shall render greater
thanks vnto theyr Redeemer,
by howe much they see them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
deliuered from greater
torments.</p>
                  <p>Neyther shall thys sight of
the reprobates miserable and
intollerable punishment, anie
whit dimme the clearenesse of
the blessednes of the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous:
because where there shal
bee no compassion of misery,
there (without doubt) shal be
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:8182:110"/>
no diminution of the blesseds
beatitude.</p>
                  <p>What if it be no meruaile, if
the sight of the damneds tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
bee vnto the righteous
a cause of greater ioy: seeing
that in a picture, a blacke co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loure
is layde vnderneath, that
a white or a redde colour, may
be seene more manifestly, and
beare the greater beautie? For
as I sayde before, the ioyes of
the righteous shal so much the
more increase, as they see the
paynes of the damned increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
from which they haue e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scaped.
A saued Father shall
not pitty his damned Sonne,
neyther shal the wife be sorrie
for her reprobate husbande.
The damned shall see till the
last iudgement the glory of
the righteous, not that they
shal knowe what it is, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
that they shall vnderstand,
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:8182:111"/>
that it is an inestimable ioy; &amp;
such an vnderstanding shal be
vnto them both griefe punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and enuie: but after
iudgement for euer they shall
bee depriued of this sight:
which shall bee an exceeding
greeuous torment vnto them,
for they shall alwayes remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
that glorie, which they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
saw, and shall think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
vnworthy to behold so
great happinesse.</p>
                  <p>Heere also an other questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
ariseth,<note place="margin">Whether the damned do see what is doone in this world.</note> whether the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
doe see what is doone in
thys world? To which S. Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorie
aunswereth in his Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals,
saying; They know not
whether theyr children be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
or ignoble. As neyther the
liuing doe knowe, what tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
the damned haue. They
knowe not what they are, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
they haue left in this world, for
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:8182:111"/>
the life of their soule is sepera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
from their body.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, it is doubted, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the damned doe wish,<note place="margin">Whether the damned doe wish that all might bee damned with them.</note> that
all may come into hel to them?
to which doubt it is answered:
As the Saints haue perfect loue
and charity, so the damned doe
burne agaynst all with spight
and hatred. Wherefore as the
Saints doe reioyce at anothers
good, so the damned doe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine
at it, neyther is there anie
thing fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d at which they more
greeue, then at the glory of the
Saints: and therfore they wish
that all might be damned, and
they boile with so great enuie,
that also they enuy the glory
of their own parents, although
lesse, then they enuie other
mens glory:<note place="margin">For thys cause y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> rich glutton would not haue hys brethren damned.</note> for they knowe,
that the nearer they are vnto
them, who are damned, that
theyr ovvne punishment is so
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:8182:112"/>
much the more encreased.
Which albeit they know, yet so
great is their hatred &amp; malice,
that they had rather suffer great
torments with many, then smal
discruciatements with a few.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, it is wont to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded,
<note place="margin">Whether the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned shal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member what they haue done in this life.</note> whether the damned
shal be mindful of those things,
which they haue done in this
life, to which S. Bernard answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
affirmatiuely, &amp; saith; that
this reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>brance shal more tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

committed, for which they are
nowe afflicted, and the good
things, which they haue omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
by which they might haue

Hence it is apparent that
there are two kinds of punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in hel:<note place="margin">Two pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>n<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

other of sence, as the Diuines
speake. Christ remembreth the
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:8182:112"/>
first, when he saith; <hi>Euery tree
that bringeth not forth good fruit,
shall be hewen downe.</hi> And the
latter, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he addeth; <hi>And shall
be cast into the fire.</hi> Of the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
of sence Gregory spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth,
saying; In hell there shal
be intollerable cold, vnquench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
fire, an immortal worm, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sufferable
stink, palpable dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
torme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ters with scourges, an
horible sight of deuils, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fusion
of sinners, &amp; endles desperatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
of any good. Therfore the da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
shal be full of all misery, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction,
&amp; griefe: for they shal
haue tears in their eyes, gnash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in their teeth, stink in their
nosthrils, houling in their mou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thes,
mourning in their throats,
terrors in their ears, bonds and
manacles vpon their hands &amp;
feet, &amp; eternall fire burning all
their parts &amp; members. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
not without cause S. Augu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>stine
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:8182:113"/>
calleth hel a denne, full of
all kinde of punishments and
miseries. For this cause the
Prophet sayth; <hi>Euery one shall
bee astonished at his neighbour,
their countenances shall be blacke
with burning:</hi> And Baruch
sayth, <hi>That theyr faces shall bee
pitchy and blacke, through the
smoake that is in the house.</hi> The
greatnes of the punishments in
hel may bee also gathered, by
the continuall mourning and
lamentation, vvhich groweth
throgh a desire of death, which
shal not come at them, nor nere
them, wherefore they shal bite
their tongues, and blaspheme
theyr Creatour, as Saint Iohn
testifieth,<note place="margin">Apoc. 16.</note> saying; <hi>They gnewe
their tongues for sorrow, &amp; blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemed
the God of heauen for
their paines, and for theyr sores.</hi>
The rigour of theyr torments
shal be so great, that despising
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:8182:113"/>
lyfe, which all so greatly loue,
they shal desire death, which all
men hate, and that very ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly,
as the same Iohn wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesseth,
when he sayth; <hi>In those
dayes shall men seeke death,<note place="margin">Apoc. 9.</note> and
shall not finde it, and shall desire to
die, &amp; death shall slee from them.</hi>
What then shal wee doe sayth
Chrysostome. For there shall
be none other thing, but mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
trembling, and lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
there all repentance shal
be too late, helpe shal be wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
punishme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts shal encrease,
neyther is any comfort or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation
euer to be looked for.
O what terrors, what gripings,
what wearines, and what tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
shal afflict them, that are
boyled in this purgatory? No
tongue can expresse, what pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment
it is, sayth Chryso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome,
to bee depriued of the
Diuine sight. There be some
<pb facs="tcp:8182:114"/>
of an absurde iudgement,<note place="margin">

for the paynes of hell, as
wee are to lament our losse, in
that wee are fallen from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen;
which is a torment in my
iudgement aboue all torments.
Hell, and the plagues of hell
are intollerable: yet if one
should say, that innumerable
hells were to bee suffered, hee
should say nothing, in respect
of the losse of that heauenlie
glory, to be hated of Christ, &amp;
to heare;<note place="margin">Hom. 47. ad pop. Antioch.</note>

punishment. But woe is vnto
vs, in that wee doe not foresee
this imminent danger: yea as
secure, impure, negligent, and
vvithout anie regarde wee ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sten
vvith greate celeritie, to
finde out this insufferable and
importable euill.</p>
                  <p>But some man vvill say:<note place="margin">Whether it be iustice, to punish a fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite sinne with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> a
finite sinne ought not to bee
punished vvith an infinite tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
Almightie GOD is
iust, and that which is finitely
committed, ought not to bee
infinitelie plagued.<note place="margin">Lib. 4 Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral. cap. 12.</note> To which
Saint Gregory aunsvvereth;
that hee should say vvell, if
the iuste and stricte Iudge
should recompence &amp; punish
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:8182:115"/>
onely the deedes, and not the
hearts of men. For the wicked
did therefore offende finitely,
because theyr lyfe vvas finite.
But they vvould haue lyued
without ende, that they might
haue continued in sinne with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
end. For they more desire
to sinne, then to liue: and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they alwayes desire to liue
heere, that whilst they liue they
may neuer cease to sin. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it belongeth to the iustice
of the strict Iudge, that they
neuer want punishment, who
were minded in this life neuer
to haue wanted sinne: and that
no ende of vengeance should
bee alotted vnto them, vvho
would make no ende of sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
while they were able to
offend. This sayth hee. Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
reason is this: The grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the person is, who is offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
the greater is the iniurie
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:8182:115"/>
and offence, and deserueth the
greater punishment, as both
Aristotle and Chrysostome a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerre.
<note place="margin">Arist. 7, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thicorum.</note> For so great is the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iury,
as the person is great, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
whom the iniury is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted.
If the person bee no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
a small iniurie becomes
great; and if the person be base
and vulgar, a great offence, is
accounted bur smally of. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
because God is infinite in
povver and in goodnes, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iury
which is offered vnto him,
is also infinite: and therefore
it is requisite and meete, that it
bee punished with an infinite
and eternall torment. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
my deare brother, thou
seeing &amp; vnderstanding these
things, &amp; considering of them
daily &amp; diligently in thy mind,
be, I pray thee carefull for the
saluation of thy soule. Let
thine eyes alwayes behold the
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:8182:116"/>
cruelty, sharpnes, and greatnes
of the tormentes in hell: al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvayes
meditate vppon those
thinges, vvhich are profitable
and wholesome for thy soule.
For it is much better for thee,
heere without intermission to
lament thy sinnes, and in thys
world with fruit to craue par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
and forgiuenes of God,
then heereafter for euer to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waile
them in the vnquencha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
flames of hell, without any
profitte or remedy. In thys
short course and pylgrimage
of thy life, thou maist by teares
and repentance obtayne re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
of thy sinnes, and blot
out the hand-vvryting<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that
God hath agaynst thee. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
mourne and lament a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
in this world, least heereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
thou mourne and lament
without end: humble thy selfe
a little here, least hereafter thou
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:8182:116"/>
beest cast dovvne into vtter
darknes, and into the euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting
flames of hell. Blessed is
hee that vvatcheth and labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
in this world, that he may
be found worthy in the day of
iudgment, of the society &amp; fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship
of the iust. But wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
and miserable is hee, that
through his ovvne fault and
negligence depriueth himselfe
of this glory. For then shall
God in the cloudes take the
righteous, and shall carry them
with him into euerlasting ioy.
But sinners shall bee haled of
deuills in to euer-during and
euer-burning fire. VVho
vvill gyue riuers of vvater to
my head, and fountaynes of
teares flovving night and day
from mine eyes, that I may
vveepe for my sinnes, and
bevvayle my selfe, and that I

<pb n="204" facs="tcp:8182:117"/>
that hee would vouchsafe mee

of whom thy chosen peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple

grewe rebellious and of a

didst shewe thy selfe terrible

them with an yron rodde, with
feare and trembling: and those
that wold not be ruled by loue

so that at the hearing

                  <p>And so long as thy fury was
not pacified by thy onelie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten
Sonne, the gates of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
were so shutte vp, that
the iustest man aliue might
not passe thorough them.
Neyther durst sinners, consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering

and theyr greeuous sinnes, and
seeing no other gates open
in all thys vvorlde, besides
those of iustice and vengeance,

for by custome they had lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned

they tasted death; because

                  <p>Many ô Lord beeing daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with this feare, did wander

no hope to find any mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie.
Others beeing seperated
from thee by ignorance, did
goe astray as sheepe without a

downe in this world. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
sayd Dauid; <hi>Say vnto my

let the time come, in which
by a new name thou thy selfe
mayst promise saluation to my

thou shalt be called Iesus, that

<pb n="212" facs="tcp:8182:123"/>
sayde Dauid in the person of
all men.</p>
                  <p>But after that thou didst re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
thy mercie, and the
promises made vnto the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
that is, that the tyme
should come, that thou thy

and misery, when I say,
thou wentest out of the hal of
thy power and iustice, &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
vnto vs didst enter into
the Pallace of thy mercy and
benignity, thou didst aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly
fulfil to all, whatsoeuer
thou hadst promised to anie.
But that greate follovver and
Apostle of thy Sonne Iesus
Christ our Lorde,<note place="margin">2, Cor. 1.</note> first began
to call thee the Father of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
and the GOD of all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation.</p>
                  <p>A Father, that hee might
signifie, that lyke a Father thou
wouldest helpe vs: A God,
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:8182:124"/>
because thou canst help whom
thou pleasest.</p>
                  <p>So that sinners seeing thee
to haue gone out of the hall
of thy seueritie, and to haue
come into the Pallace of thy

thee cloathed on euery side
with theyr vestiments, &amp; made
one of theyr housholde; they
vvould no more vvander and
vage vp and downe, but bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
vnited to thy most holie
Church, they come to thy
throane with sincere faith, and
firme hope, desiring remission
of their sinnes.</p>
                  <p>Thou hast done ô Lorde, as
hunters vse to doe, who that
they may not feare the vvilde
beast, doe cloathe themselues
after the colour of the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne:
so also thou tookest vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
thee an earthen vesture,
like vs, that thou mightest take
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:8182:124"/>
whom thou wouldest. For as
thou didst show thine omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potencie
in times past, by po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
and reuengement: so thou
now wouldest shew thy mercy
by pardoning and forgyuing.
For to remitte an offered iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,
is no lesser glory, then to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge
it, yea it is greater glory
to forgiue it. Therefore there
is not, neyther can there bee a
sinne so great, which thou do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
not forgiue to him that is
penitent.</p>
                  <p>If a sinner had beene so vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy,
that considering the
greatnes of his sins, he had not
seene thy power and goodnes,
he had dispaired of pardon, &amp;
had sayde that, which in times
past our first brother Cain said,
and after him Iudas, that is, <hi>My

and had layd violent hands
vpon himselfe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="215" facs="tcp:8182:125"/>Therefore let him nowe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce,
and lyft vp his eyes to
heauen, whence commeth ayd
and helpe to all them, that are
found in the tribulations and
miseries of this world. Let him
open the eyes of his soule by
fayth, &amp; let him behold round
about him ensignes and ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
displayed; not banners of
warre, of vengeance, or of iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice:
but of pitty, of mercie,
of pardon, of friendship, and of
reconciliation to all them, that
desire it in truth. Let him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
those honoured and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
in this Pallace, who were
wont to be his aduersaries and
enemies.</p>
                  <p>There he shall see that great
and famous sinner Magdalen
receaued into fauour. There
hee shall see those humbled,
and brought low, who suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
themselues wise and holie
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:8182:125"/>
men; and them exalted, who
confessed themselues sinners,
and of no merrit. There hee
shall see that sinner S. Peter,
who was a periured denier of
his Maister, to bee made a pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler
of the Church. There hee
shall see Saint Paule, that wolfe
and persecuter of the flock, to
be made a vessell of election.</p>
                  <p>Therfore let all sinners com,
let the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> come I say to thys pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace
of mercie; and let them
constantly and assuredly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue,
that no man in the world
dooth heereafter so sinne, or
can sinne, that hee cannot or
may not obtaine remission at
Gods handes for all his mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deedes:
neyther that any en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities,
or quarrels can arise to
that height and passe, vvhich
can vtterly shutte vp the gates
of frindship and reconciliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="217" facs="tcp:8182:126"/>Wherefore, I feeling my selfe
burdened with the weight of
my sinnes, &amp; swallowed vp in
the gulfe of misery, &amp; desiring
especially the sight of the eyes
of my soule, which errors and
foule enormous sinnes haue
shut vp and blinded, and with
greater desire and thyrst desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
&amp; thirsting for thy grace,
and fauour, then the Hart or
the Hunter dooth the vvater
brookes, I come to the throne
of thy grace, entreating &amp; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seeching
thee ô Lord, with that
humility, vvhich the greatest
sinner can come withal, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his vnvvorthines, and his
enormities done and commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
before his eyes, vvho once
gaue him both being and life,
and after hee had lost it by sin,
and returned againe by repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
eftsoones restored it: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
his Maiestie, who with his
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:8182:126"/>
onely VVorde, that is, with his
VVisedome, created &amp; made
all thinges of nothing: before
him, in whose power it is, not
only to create a thousand other
vvorlds, but also to doe those
things, which can neyther en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
into the thought of Angel,
or any other creature. Before
him, I say, I come, and say,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Haue mercy vpon me, ô Lord.</hi>
And because, ô my Lorde, I
haue no merrits, by vvhich I
may boldly presume to come
vnto thee, (for I am not onelie
vnwoorthy of this thy great
mercy, but haue also iustly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued
damnation &amp; destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in hell) I desire this.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>According to thy great goodnes.</hi>
According to which, if we wel
consider, howe thou hast al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
vsed it towards sinners,
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:8182:127"/>
I beleeue, and am verily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded,
that thou art more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie
to be intreated, and readier
to forgiue, then I through my
weakenesse and infirmitie am
prone vnto sin. And because
my sinnes haue so increased, &amp;
risen to that height, that they
are come into the presence of
thy diuine Maiestie, behold it
was in my power to fall, and
through mine owne fault haue
I gone astray: but to rise a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
and come home is not
in my power, except thou suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courest
and releeuest mee with
thy singuler &amp; especial grace:
therfore I humblie desire thee
to haue mercie on me,
<q>According to the multitude
of thy mercies.</q>
Thee I say, I most humbly do
beseeche, vvho hast beene so
pittifull and mercifull towards
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:8182:127"/>
sinners, that of vncleane &amp; fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
wretches, thou hast made
them holy and righteous men,
that with the fire of thy loue,
which (as the Prophet sayth)
thou thy selfe art, calling thee
a fire, which dooth consume,
thou wouldest purge, burne
vp, and vtterly consume, all
mine iniquities and imperfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions:
making mee of a stone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cold
sinner, a most ardent lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer,
and feruent follower of
thee, and of thy precepts and
commaundements. Neyther
only purge me from my sinnes
past, but
<q>Wash mee throughly from my
wickednesse: and cleanse mee
from my sinne.</q>
Wash mee so, ô Lorde, and so
cleanse all mine inward parts,
that there may not any thing
remaine in mee, that may soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:8182:128"/>
mee to sinne againe. Giue
me strength and fortitude, to
ouercome the world, the deuil,
and the flesh, least I returne to
mine olde wayes &amp; former er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors.
And because I knowe, ô
Lord, that no man doth lyue,
that of himselfe can be iustified
in thy sight and presence: and
that thou doost onely vvill
this, that hee that desireth to
haue forgiuenes of his sinnes,
do acknowledge and confesse
himselfe a sinner, and that hee
lament and bewayle his mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deedes;
I being such a one, doe
say:
<q>For I acknowledge my faults:
and my sin is euer before mee.</q>
I doe acknowledge, I say, my
faultes, and confesse them not
onely outwardly, but also in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly.
For although there are
some, that beeing spotted and
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:8182:128"/>
polluted with vaine hipocrisie,
and with some other vice doe
deceiue men vnder a shadowe
of pietie, yet Lord no man ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
can possibly deceiue thee
with a show of outward sanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titie,
if inwardly he be not so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed.</p>
                  <p>I haue learned by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
that the inwarde sinne is
opposite and contrary to euery

bee so many and so great,

giuing no credite to thy words

art angry and cruell, and doost
thinke vpon punishment and
vengeance, and not vpon par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
and forgiuenes. And such
when they shall see, that thou,
ô my Lord, doost forgiue mee
my sinnes, will bee of another

is to them, that serue thee with
humilitie. I hauing tasted of
thy Spirit, my flesh and bones
which are nowe broken, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they serued earthly and
vile thinges, shall returne with
gladnesse to the obedience of
thy Spirit: They shall taste of
the high misteries of thy
workes, &amp; shall know a great
part of thy goodnesse &amp; gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciousnesse,
which both heere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore
thou hast vsed, and stil
vsest daily to all the nations of
the world: wherefore they shall
persecute those thinges vvith a
deadly hate, vvhich they haue
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:8182:134"/>
passed thorow, and that which
heeretofore was sweet &amp; plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant
vnto them, now they shall
esteem it bitter: &amp; that which
they refused as bitter, now they
shall desire it as most sweet, &amp;
shall giue thee immortall
thanks, because thou hast deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered
them out of the depth of
misery, in which they wallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
beeing deciued with a false
vizard of pleasure &amp; gladnes:
&amp; because now ô lord, throgh
thy gracious goodnesse I am
come to the knowledge &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testation
of my sinnes, beeing
the ready way to saluation, O
Lord I pray thee,
<q>Turne thy face from my sins,
and put out all my misdeedes.</q>
Turne thy diuine face, I say,
the beholding and contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of which is eternall lyfe:
deale not with me after my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serts,
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:8182:135"/>
but looke vpon mee with
the eyes of thy mercy, and take
from mee all my wickednesse.
Purge me, ô lord, and cleanse
me, not only from sinnes past,
but from all those, that may
happen to mee heereafter.
<q>Create in mee a cleane hart, ô
God, and renue a right spirite
within mee.</q>
Take from me my stony hart,
which hetherto hath delighted
it selfe with the loue and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation
of abiect and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane
things, and therefore it
is vncleane and polluted, I pray
thee ô lord take this from mee,
and vouchsafe to create ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in me, cleane, pure, and
chast. Take from me the spirit
of pride, of vaine-glory, of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetousnes,
of luxury, and of
many other vices and slaueries,
which hath raigned in mee, &amp;
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:8182:135"/>
renew within me a right, mild,
and humble spirit, vvhich may
thirst after all righteousnesse.
Thou knowest, ô lorde, that
we are earth, and a masse of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iquitie,
and that vnlesse thou
doost support vs with thine
hand, we cannot do any thing,
but that which is earthly, there-I
pray thee;
<q>Cast mee not away from thy
presence, and take not thy ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
spirit from me.</q>
But alwayes direct mee &amp; pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue
mee with thy right hand,
that I may say as the Prophet
sayd in times past; <hi>The Lord is
my Sheepheard,<note place="margin">Psalm, 23,</note> I shall not want.</hi>
Take not from mee thy holie
Spirit, the true comforter of
the afflicted who is the way of
truth to all them, that as wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers,
lost, and desolate, doe
enter into the blinde Labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:8182:136"/>
of thys worlde, yea rather
Lord
<q>Restore to mee the ioy of thy
saluation, and stablish me with
thy free spirit.</q>
Giue mee grace, that by medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating
on those things, vvhich
thou hast wrought for our
saluation, and workest daily, &amp;
in beholding thy will, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirest
not the death of a sinner,
but that hee may be conuerted
and liue, I may enioy that true
ioy, and rest, which they enioy,
who beeing guiltie of eternall
death, doe heare that theyr sins
are forgiuen them; not of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
that haue no power to doe it,
but of him that is omnipotent,
who can neyther deceiue nor
be deceiued: who as hee can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
die, so hee cannot fayle in
his promise.</p>
                  <p>Take from me ô lorde, the
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:8182:136"/>
spirit of bondage, which I haue
hetherto obeyed, and streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
me in thy loue and grace,
with thy royall and free spirit,
not subiect to the worlde, the
flesh, or the deuill, that we may
serue thee with ioy, in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
of the works of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnes,
in the libertie of the
Gospell, to the which vvee are
restored by thy Sonne Christ
our lord and Sauiour.</p>
                  <p>And then, ô lorde, I beeing
strengthened by thy mercie, I
shall not onely be free, &amp; clean
fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all sin: but I shal march in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the fielde as a couragious
warriour, &amp; valiant captaine, &amp;
<q>I shall teach thy wayes vnto
the wicked, and sinners shal be
conuerted vnto thee.</q>
Who seeing me to be made of
wicked iust, of weake mighty,
of a seruaunt free, of a subiect
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:8182:137"/>
thine adopted sonne, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering
thys to be doone not
by mans strength, but by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine
power, they will bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted
vnto thee with all their
hart, and with all theyr soule.
But I pray thee, ô my lord, and
the GOD of my saluation,
whilst I am conuersant vvith
wicked, peruerse, and vngodly
men, doe not suffer me to sin
with them, or to pollute my
selfe with theyr blemishes. But
<q>Deliuer mee from blood-gilti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
O God, thou that art the
God of my health: and my
tongue shall sing of thy righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse.</q>
As the sunne vvith his beames
dooth pierce and penetrate all
thinges,<note place="margin">A Simily.</note> both pure &amp; impure,
and is not onely not polluted,
but also dooth purge those
things that are infected &amp; cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted:
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:8182:137"/>
so I beeing clothed
with the beames and heate of
thy charitie and loue, may with
out spotte and blemish be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersant
among the impure &amp;
vncleane. Thys if thou vvilt
grant mee, my tongue beeing
directed and guided by thy
grace and ayde, shall plant thy
righteousnes in their harts, and
they shall be deceiued, when
they shall thinke that it is my
worke, seeing that it is thine.
For of my selfe I am not suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
to doe it, nay I am not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to speake a worde without
thy helpe &amp; grace. That ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they may acknowledge
this, and yeelde thee thy due
prayse, and not bestowe it on
mee,
<q>Open thou my lippes, ô Lorde,
and my mouth shall shew forth
thy prayse.</q>
                     <pb n="239" facs="tcp:8182:138"/>
And now ô lorde, I offer thee
my spirit afflicted &amp; troubled,
because I haue offended thee,
to which I add a purpose of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendement.
Which sacrifice
I know doth please thee, &amp; to
be that, which thou requirest.
<q>For thou desirest no sacrifice,
though I woulde giue it, thou
delightest not in burnt offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings.</q>
For now is the time, in which
no burnt offerings nor cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniall
sacrifices doe please
thee, or shall at any time here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after
content thee: for thou
art a Spirit, and wilt bee vvor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped
in Spirit. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<q>The sacrifice of God is a trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
spirit: a broken and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trite
hart (ô God) shalt thou
not despise.</q>
                     <pb n="240" facs="tcp:8182:138"/>
And because I knovve that no
man in this vvorlde, so long
as he liueth, doth come too late
to desire mercy and fauour at
thy hands: but that he shall al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
finde thee ready to giue
it vnto vs, therefore I desire
thee againe;
<q>O be fauourable and gracious
vnto Sion: build thou the wals
of Ierusalem.</q>
Deale with mee ô Lord graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
&amp; mercifully, according
vnto thy good will and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
and giue mee grace, that
the decayed and ruinous walls
of my soule, which are able to
hold out no force of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
may againe bee inwardly
reedified, that I may offer vnto
thee the true works of inward
righteousnes, which presently
shall follow the outward, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
signes of the inward. From
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:8182:139"/>
whence afterwards as from a
liuely fountayne, shall flow the
edifying of my neighbour, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
which duplicity of works shall
arise a sweete harmony, accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
vnto thy diuine Maiesty,
and a sacrifice ioyned to that,
with which thou thy self saidst,
that thou art well pleased;
<q>For then shalt thou accept the
sacrifices of righteousnes, euen
the burnt offering and oblati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
then shall they offer calues
vpon thine Altar.</q>
All these things, I say, ô Lorde
shall they offer vpon thine Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
as a new sacrifice, of which
the Prophet spake; <hi>This shall
please the Lorde better then a
young bullocke,<note place="margin">Psal 69.</note> that hath hornes
and hoofes,</hi> that is, the humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Christ our Redeemer thy
Sonne, and his sacrifice; by
whose merrits our workes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:8182:139"/>
vnworthy, &amp; of no value,
are made gratefull and accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
in thy sight.</p>
                  <p>After this manner therefore
ô Lord, both I, and others with
mee, who haue beene sinners,
lyuing now in thy worship and
seruice, will say:
<q>Glory be to the Father, and to
the Sonne, and to the holie
Ghost: As it was in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning,
&amp;c.</q>
VVe will prayse and glorifie
thee alwaies both in this world,
and in the other, as the Father,
Creator &amp; maker of all things;
and thy Sonne, the Deuine
Wisedome, as him, by whom
we alone are worthy to be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
and to be in deed thy Sons;
and the holy Ghost, as the
Doctour &amp; Teacher of grace,
the Comforter, Patrone, and
Leader to all good purposes.
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:8182:140"/>
VVho in the distinction of
persons, in a perfect Trinity, in
the vnity of substance, and in

without beginning, vvithout

without end. Amen.</p>

of the name of
Iesus.</head>
                  <p>O Good Iesus, ô sweete
Iesus, ô Iesus the Son
of the virgin Mary, full
of pitty and mercy. O
sweete Iesus haue mercy vpon
me, according to thine infinite
goodnes. O bountiful Iesus,
I an vnwoorthie sinner doe
pray thee, by that thy precious
blood, which thou dist shed
vpon the Crosse, for sinners &amp;
vngodly men, that thou woul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest
wash me from all my sins,
&amp; that thou wouldest not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spise
thy seruant, who humbly
prayeth, and calleth vpon this
most holy name of Iesus. This
thy name Iesus is a sweet name,
yea it is sweeter then any Nec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar
or Ambrosia; this thy name
Iesus is a sauing name. For
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:8182:5"/>
what is Iesus, but a Sauiour?
Therefore ô good Iesus, who
of thy goodnes hast created
mee, and vvith thy precious
blood hast redeemed mee, doe
not suffer my soule to be haled
downe to hell, by reason of my
many and great transgressions.
Let not mine iniquities, ô good
Iesus, condemne my soule, cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated
of thine infinite goodnes.
Acknowledge in mee, ô good
Iesus, and chalenge, vvhat is
thine; that is, my soule: and
take from mee that which is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nothers,
that is, all my sins and
enormities. O good Iesus haue
mercy vpon mee, as long as I
am in this world, least I be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
in that fearefull day of
iudgement. O good Iesus, if
I a peruerse sinner shal deserue
according to thy iustice to bee
damned, by reason of my gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous
and enormous sinnes, I
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:8182:3"/>
humbly appeale from thy se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uere
iustice, to thy gracious &amp;
pittifull mercy: assuredlie tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting,
that thou my Lord Iesus
wilt be gracious and mercifull
to my soule, as a gracious Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and a mercifull GOD.
VVhat profit, ô good Iesus,
will there be in my flesh, if my
soule goe downe to hell?</p>
                  <p>For it is certaine ô Lord, that
no man in hel, shal yeeld praise
to thy holy name Iesus. O
most mercifull Iesus, bee mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull
to vs. O most sweet Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus,
deliuer vs from all our tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulations
and anguishes. O
good Iesus, be gentle and kind
to vs wretched sinners. O most
holy Iesus, associate our soules
with thine elect in heauen. O
most pittifull Iesus, the saluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of all them, that hope in
thee, comfort vs. O Iesus the
Sonne of the most holy virgin
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:8182:4"/>
Mary, bestow on vs thy mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
grace, wisedome, charity,
