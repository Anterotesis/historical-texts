         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </gap>eſty in his Throne: hee had with the advice of his

Parliament in <hi>England:</hi> who were forced by an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent
faction, they having broken all Oaths and
Covenants, which they had made both to God and
Man: and to that purpoſe, was now putting himſelf in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a poſture of defence: And that for the managing of
this Deſigne, hee had correſpondency with the King,
with the <hi>Scots,</hi> and generally all the Presbyterian party
that were agreed with the King: who were reſolved to
endevour to their utmoſt the re-inthroning the King,
and reſtoring a free Parliament, which hee fully decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
this not to be: and for the better effecting and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying
on this Deſigne, he was reſolved to joyn with the
Lord <hi>Taff,</hi> and the whole <hi>Iriſh</hi> of the Province of <hi>Mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter:</hi>
who have aſſured him of their aſſiſtance, both
with their perſons and eſtates, and that he had now ſent
for us, who were only the ſuſpected party of the Army
to report this to us, and to require of us our reſolution
whether wee all would comply with him in this or no:
To which we anſwered, Wee ſtood for the King and
Parliament, as wee had ever done, upon which hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired

<pb n="3" facs="tcp:58797:3"/>
it was this preſent Parliament wee meant, for hee
ſaid the truth was, they did not acknowledge this to be
a Parliament, to which wee anſwered his Lordſhip, we
could not comply with him: he ſtill uſing many aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations,
to make good what hee had ſaid againſt them,
and farther ſaid, Hee hoped to ſee this preſent Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
laid flat on their backs by <hi>Michaelmas</hi> day, and
that this was no raſh reſolution, but a premeditated a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
he being confident, that let it come to the worſt
it could, yet in ſpight of all, hee would be able to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
good terms both for himſelf and the reſt that ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hered
to him: and that which induced him chiefly to
put it in practice at preſent was, that he was now aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
hee was before-hand with the Independent party,
which hee never was before; yet hee had thought for
ſome time longer to have forborn his declaring, but yet
ſome ſuſpitions, the Vice-admirall Captaine <hi>John
Crowther</hi> had of him; could not permit him to carry it
private any longer, in regard the ſaid Captain <hi>Crowther</hi>
had proteſted againſt him, and blockt up his Harbours,
and his Lordſhip did further declare, that all which
would not joyn with him in this deſign, he required the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
to depart, and go for <hi>England,</hi> for that hee would not
permit any neere him, or in his Army, that would not
faithfully comply with him in his intention; and as a
motive to induce us to joyn with him, hee informed us
that he was certainly aſſured, that Collonel <hi>Jones</hi> had
by order from the Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> made a Ceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation
with <hi>Owen Roe Oneal,</hi> and that faction; who choſe
rather to enter into League with the Parliament then
