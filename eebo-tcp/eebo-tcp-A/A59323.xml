         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

inſomuch that there ſeldom was a meeting or
Deſign of Merriment intended, or Contrived
by any Perſon of Quality there, but <hi>Mounſieur
Monery</hi> muſt be one, who as often return'd
their kindneſs in their own way.</p>
               <p>It hapened that to one of his Feaſts or
Grand Balls, there came a Gentleman out of
the County of <hi>Clare,</hi> invited to that Feaſt, by
the Maſter of i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Boy, that waited on him as his Page, whoſe
<hi>Carriage</hi> and great Diligence in his Office of
Page-ſhip, <hi>Monſieur Monery</hi> took great notice
of, and was very much taken with: which
the Gentleman perceiving was very willing to
Oblige; and the other conceiving it a greater
preferment of the Boy, beſtowed him as a great
Preſent to the <hi>Monſieur,</hi> who received him ſo:
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:105373:6"/>
and having with a great deal of Language,
expreſt his thanks, deſired to know the Boys
Name: he told him his Name was <hi>Dennis
Clancie;</hi> the <hi>Monſieur</hi> immediately altered the
Boys Habit, and gave him all the teſtimonies
of a kind Reception; with which, the Boy
was ſo tranſported, that he ſtudied nothing
more than to pleaſe his Maſter, by being rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
at his Call or Beck: never out of the way
to wait the Service or Command of his Maſter:
and continued ſo (not only during his Maſters
ſtay in <hi>Ireland</hi>) but for ſome years after his
coming into <hi>France,</hi> where the Boy had all
convenient opportunities for his Education
could be wiſht for, which he neglected not;
but made ſo good uſe of his time, that he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
it to the full, by acquiring the French
Tongue perfectly, and all that he could ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
both from his Latine and Dancing Maſter,
or what elſe the Academy could afford:
which took ſo with the <hi>Monſieur,</hi> that he could
not conceal from his Friends and acquaintance
how precious a Jewel he had of his Boy <hi>Clan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie;</hi>
to whoſe Breaſt he durſt commit the
greateſt Secret: Nor was he Maſter of that
thing in the World, he could not truſt his
Servant <hi>Clancie</hi> with.</p>
               <p>As appeared upon an occaſion the <hi>Monſieur</hi>
had to Travil into ſome far remote part
whither his occaſions drew him, and required
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:105373:7"/>
his attendance for ſome conſiderable Time;
which he acquainted his truſty Servant with;
and told him withal, how great his ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
was at Parting, to know he left behind
him the truſtieſt, carefulleſt, and honeſteſt Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
in the World; in whom he ſo much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fided,
that he would leave him in his Houſe
at <hi>Paris,</hi> to have a particular Care of his
Trunks; wherein there lay ſome Papers of
concern, his Apparel, and ſome Money. The
Boy having with Tears expreſſed his great
ſorrow for being left behind his Dear Maſter;
from whom he had never been ſeparated ſince
his coming into his Service till now; not
knowing what it was to diſobey, receives his
Charge, takes leave of his Maſter and
Fellow-Servants, and with a heavy heart pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares
for <hi>Paris</hi> to his Maſters houſe, where he
was received by his Fellow-Servants there
with much chearfulneſs; and as ſoon as he had
ſhewed his Maſters Orders, it was with a great
deal of readineſs immediately obſerv'd, and
<hi>Clancie</hi> put into the poſſeſſion of thoſe Rooms
wherein lay thoſe Trunks formerly mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Clancie</hi> very Dilligently came every day
to diſcharge his Truſt, by Airing his Maſters
<hi>Cloathes,</hi> ſorting his Papers, and ſome times
<hi>Fingering his Money,</hi> only to pleaſe himſelf by
the ſight of ſuch a ſumm in his own Cuſtody,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:105373:7"/>
which he could hardly believe, although hour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
at the ſport of telling.</p>
               <p>One Day being invited to his Exerciſe of
<hi>Bruſhing,</hi> by a Clear and bright Sun-ſhine day
(which he ſeldome neglected) comes into the
Room, Locks the Dore, lays apart each <hi>Suit
of Clothes,</hi> with all that belongd to it:)
(and looking about, ſeeing no body to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
him) had a great deſire to ſee how that
would become him, which he puts on, walks
up and down, then to the Looking-Glaſs he
goes; where he was ſo ſtartled at firſt, that
he ſtept back; hardly knowing who it was in
ſuch a Habit. But finding at laſt, after part
of his wonder was over, that it was himſelf;
begins to propoſe to himſelf, how happy and
how fortunate ſhould he be, if he could order
matters ſo, as to keep all this finery by which
he was ſo altered, that he might but appear
to all others, as to himſelf in the Glaſs.</p>
               <p>This Great and ſtrange Alteration more
and more increaſes, being by his Thoughts
purſued upon every occaſion when ever he
changes out of one Suit into another. Till at
laſt it is reſolved that his Thoughts are reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs,

being very well ſatisfied, he will do
nothing without Commiſſion from his Maſter:
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:105373:8"/>
and therefore will rather aſſiſt than hinder
him in whatever he attempts.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Clancie</hi> tells the People, he will remove his
Trunks to his Maſters Country-houſe, where
he is commanded to wait his coming. In order
to which, there are Carts prepared, the Goods
packed up, and <hi>Clancie</hi> upon his Road, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied
by ſeveral of his Comrades that
came in Compliement to ſee him part of his
way. Who no ſooner took their Leaves, but
he ſteered his courſe another way, and Bends
toward the Sea-ſide, where meeting a Ship ready
to ſet Sail for <hi>Wexford</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi> agrees with
the Owner: puts his Goods aboard, of whom
we hear no more till his arrival in <hi>Wexford.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Where was received by the chief of that
place as a perſon of that Quality (that he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed)
ought to be. The ſhow he made by his
Equipage, and the number of his Attendance,
with his bounty to the Captain of the Ship, and
his Seamen who were not ſparing to give a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
large Character of him: confirm'd the
Inhabitants of <hi>Wexford</hi> that he muſt be a great
Man; and was ſo free of his Coin at all times,
to thoſe that did him any Service, by which
he gave occaſion to be made the only <hi>Table
Talk,</hi> and chief Diſcourſe of the Town: hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
was he could have opportunity to Contract
a Friendſhip with him, his Diſcourſe was very
takeing, eſpecially amongſt the Ladies, and
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:105373:8"/>
the better ſort: ſpending his time in Feaſting,
and making entertainments at any Rate; and
receiving Returns of like nature was ſo pleaſing
a Paſtime to him, without regard to expence,
that he intended to ſpend moſt of his time
there, to the great ſatisfaction of them all.</p>
               <p>He had not been many Months there, when
there chanced to arrive in the ſame Harbour a
Noble-man of <hi>Scotland,</hi> coming out of <hi>Spain,</hi>
by Name, the <hi>Earl</hi> of <hi>Crafford.</hi> The Towns<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
Reſolving to Receive, and Entertain him
as became them, made Sute to their Friend
<hi>Major Clancie</hi> to Countenance them in this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt:
who was very glad of the occaſion, to
bring him into the Earl of <hi>Craffords</hi> Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance;
who did it ſo well, and ſo much to
their ſatisfaction, that they look upon it as a
great Addition to the many former favours he
had conferred upon them; after the Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial
part was over at the water ſide, the chief
Magiſtrate with all the Aldermen and moſt
conſiderable of the Town, having finiſhed
Compliment, and</p>
               <p>

behalf, ſignifying how happy he accounted
himſelf, to have ſo fit an Opportunity to give
his Service to my Lord: for all which my
Lord makes ſuch a return of thanks, that all
were extreamly ſatisfied. The Major deſired
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:105373:9"/>
his Lordſhip to do him the honour to make uſe
of his appartment till his own was in
readineſs, which my Lord willingly accepted
of: where was prepared for his Reception, a
very <hi>Hanſome Treat;</hi> to which were invited
(to keep my Lord Company) the <hi>Beſt of the
Town;</hi> ſo ſoon as my Lords Quarters were rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
they all in their ſeveral ſtations waited up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his Lordſhip thither: and all took their
Leave, only <hi>Major Clancie,</hi> with whoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation
my Lord was ſo pleaſed, that he was
unwilling to part ſo ſoon, though ſufficiently
weary after ſo tedious a Voyage.</p>
               <p>The day following, his Lordſhip having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh'd
himſelf, was very deſirous to ſpend
ſome time in Merriment, with thoſe Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
that had been ſo civil to him upon his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival,
eſpecially <hi>Major Clancie,</hi> to whom my
Lord ſent to invite the Reſt to Dine, and
bring ſuch others with him as he thought fit.
The <hi>Major</hi> to obſerve my Lords Command,
having firſt invited thoſe of the Town, and
meeting accidentally with a Perſon of Quality,
dwelling two or three Miles from <hi>Wexford,</hi>
named Mr. <hi>Cheevers,</hi> who was very deſirous to
kiſs my Lord of <hi>Craffords</hi> hand, the Major in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites
him to Dine with my Lord, my Lord
welcomes him with all the Chearfulneſs ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable.</p>
               <p>Much time was ſpent in Feaſting, each one
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:105373:9"/>
ſtriving to outdo the other, all intending the
wellcome of my Lord of <hi>Crafford.</hi> Major
<hi>Clancie</hi> is counted the beſt Garniſh to each
Feaſt: Mr. <hi>Cheevers</hi> being at ſeveral of them,
conceives himſelf oblieged to take his turn
in the <hi>Liſt,</hi> which he ſpeedily effects, being
ſeldome unprepared for all ſuch Encounters:
ſome few days after, Mr. <hi>Cheevers</hi> having ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
his Lady how he was invited by <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor
Clancie,</hi> and ſo extreamly much made of
by my <hi>Lord Crafford,</hi> commending to that height
the <hi>Perſon</hi> and <hi>Parts</hi> of the <hi>Major,</hi> which put
both <hi>Wife</hi> and <hi>Daughters</hi> into no ſmall longing
for the Sight and Converſation of the <hi>Perſon</hi>
ſo much commended by Mr. <hi>Cheevers,</hi> that
ſeldome was heard to commend any Man, that
they all preſs for his coming to their Houſe,
which is agreed upon. An entertainment is
prepared in Mr. <hi>Cheevers</hi>'s Houſe, to which is
invited the <hi>Earl</hi> of <hi>Crafford, Major Clancie</hi>
and ſome Neighbours.</p>
               <p>It would undoubtedly be too tedious in the
recital, if I ſhould particulariſe each Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
and Ceremony made uſe of, where ſo
many Ladies are concerned, and ſo many
great Perſons entertained. Therefore let it
ſuffice, that you know the Preparation is
great, the Company very Gallant, and the
Ladies very Fine; this Feaſt continues four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
days, every Creature ſo ſatisfied, and
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:105373:10"/>
Complaiſant that chearfulneſs might be read
in every ones Countenance, eſpecially the
Major, who is ſo taken with his new Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance
Mrs. <hi>Katherine,</hi> eldeſt Daughter
to Mr. <hi>Cheevers,</hi> to whom he bends all his
Addreſſes, with ſo much earneſtneſs, as if
he had reſolved to Dedicate his whole Life
and Fortune to her Service (ſhe finding ſo
great a confirmation of thoſe Truths, as ſhe
believed ſpoke by her Father in praiſe and
Commendation of the Major) was willing
enough, ſo far as her Modeſty would give her
leave, to receive and return in like manner,
all thoſe paſſionate Expreſſions of his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quenchable
Flame; if not reſtrained by the
ſtrict Rules of his Duty, which ſhe reſolves
never to ſwerve from. Her Father having
ſome hints given him of the Buſineſs, took
a ſeaſonable opportunity (meeting his Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
in the Garden very ſolitary) begins to
examine her, with a ſtrict Charge not to
Conceal any part of the Truth, as ſhe va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued
her only happineſs, and the quiet and
conſolation of a ſond Father (whom ſhe
knew lov'd her above the reſt of his
Children) To which ſhe made this Anſwer,
That ſhe would ſooner hazard her being for
ever unhappy, than once diſpleaſe him, and
that ſhe never intended to diſpoſe of her ſelf,
without his Privity and conſent: and that
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:105373:10"/>
however her inclinations were bent, this
was her reſolution. <hi>My Child</hi> (ſays Mr.
<hi>Cheevers</hi>) I am glad to hear you ſay ſo, and
yet do find that you count your ſelf unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
for ever, if you have not this Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.
But my Child, have a little patience
till I make a farther inquiry into the matter;
that in Caſe I find him to be the Son and
Heir of Mr. <hi>Clancie</hi> of <hi>Enestmian</hi> (as he ſays)
I may provide him ſuch a Portion as his <hi>Estate</hi>
deſerves. Whereupon, ſhe being willing to
ſecond her Inclinations, and having this little
encouragement from her Father, continued
her wonted kindneſs to her Lover; which the
Father perceiving, and being apprehenſive that
ſo much Familiarity might occaſion worſe
effects, either to her Reputation, or the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatisfaction
of her Parents, would ſometimes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
give her Admonitions, ſome ſharp Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions;
bidding her beware, leſt ſhe run
headlong to her one deſtruction, by Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a Man (that for ought he knew) would
prove a <hi>Counterfeit,</hi> ſhe having contracted ſo
great a Frindſhip with her Beloved, could con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal
nothing from him not ſo much as her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
Advice. Wherein the word <hi>Counterfeit</hi>
was uſed, which by the <hi>Major</hi> was interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
as the greateſt term of Reflection in the
world, and told her; that if it were not for
her ſake that was dearer to him than all other
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:105373:11"/>
conſiderations; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e would expect reparation: ſhe
percieving how great a Diſcompoſure her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcretion
put him into, could not forbear to
expreſs with her Tears, the ſorrow of heart;
he perſwaded her by all the endearing Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
of a paſſionate Lover to forbear grieving,
giving her all the aſſurance of his conſtanſie,
that her own heart could wiſh: by telling her
that neither this, or any thing could happen:
ſhould ever have power to alter him, or leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen
his affection in the Leaſt: and that
affection ſhould never end but with his Life.
With which ſhe reſted ſatisfied, being willing
to give Credit to all he ſays; this paſt on till
Dinner, to which the <hi>Major</hi> was called. The
Company being ſet, all took Notice of the
great change they obſerved in the <hi>Majors</hi>
Countenance; my Lord asked him what the
Matter was? Whether an Indiſpoſition of the
Body, or the Mind? He anſwered, That his
Provocation was ſuch, as might very well oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
both; when his Honour and Reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
were queſtioned, where he could hope for
little or no redreſs. This put them all to Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence;
every Body bethinking themſelves
wherein, or which way they or either of them
had given the <hi>Major</hi> any manner of Offence.
Mr. <hi>Cheevers,</hi> who was extreamly troubled to
ſee ſo great a Diſappointment, both to him,
and his Friend, that intended nothing but
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:105373:11"/>
Mirth: broke the ſilence firſt by deſiring the
<hi>Major</hi> to aſſure himſelf in the knowledge that
there was not one in this Company but loved
and Honoured him, and would be moſt heartily
ſorry to give the leaſt occaſion for a thought of
diſſervice to him, and therefore deſired him to
lay aſide all ſuch apprehention: and continue
his wonted cuſtom of being the beſt company
in the World; without which there was no
living. My <hi>Lord</hi> and the reſt ſaid as much, or
rather more to the ſame purpoſe; to which the
<hi>Major</hi> liſtned with a great deal of attention,
and after having given to each particular
thanks for thoſe kind expreſſions, turns to
Mr. <hi>Cheevers,</hi> and tells him that he ſcarce knew
how to reconcile thoſe differences that occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned
all this diſſorder. Firſt, his obligation
for all the Favours he had received in ſo p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
an entertainment, and ſo large profeſſions
of kindneſs, and but the day before when he
was adviſing his Daughter in Terms of ſo great
reflection upon him, by calling him a <hi>Counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit:</hi>
that he did not well know how to bear
it, and told him with all, that it was an ill
Garniſh to ſo brave entertainment, to upbraid
Gentlemen of Quality, whoſe Birth, and edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
rendred them capable of better Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage:
and that for his own part, his trouble
was ſo great to accaſion ſo much diſquiet to
this noble company, and ſo diſcompoſed for his
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:105373:12"/>
affront: that he could believe no better of
himſelf than a <hi>Bedlam,</hi> nor could he propoſe
better Medium at all, but to leave the place,
and ſo depart, he deſired my <hi>Lord of Crafford's</hi>
countenance: who was ſo much a Servant to
the <hi>Major;</hi> that he could deny him nothing;
but being very deſirous to reconcile thoſe dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences,
uſed all the means he could think of,
but all in vain.</p>
               <p>So ſoon as dinner was done, my <hi>Lord</hi> gave or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
to his People to make ready, ſo did the
<hi>Major,</hi> it is impoſſible to tell you how this ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain
change of the Scene turned and altered the
Face of affairs in this place. Where hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
there was nothing to be ſeen, or heard: but
what gladly contributed to the unſpeakable ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
and conſolation of the whole Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany.
Now upon the ſuddain (as if the fates
had conſpired the ruin of all their happineſs)
turned quite another way: all ſo con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ounded
and troubled for parting in this manner, that
none knew well how to diſpoſe of themſelves,
eſpecially poor Mrs. <hi>Katherine:</hi> who lookes
upon her ſelf as the moſt miſerable, and moſt
unfortunate Creature in the World, to be the
only and abſolute Author, and occaſion of this
ſo unhappy a ſeparation: ſhe is now like a
Priſoner confined. After taking their leaves,
and diſtributing to the Servants; the whole
Company diſperſed, my <hi>Lord</hi> and the <hi>Major</hi>
                  <pb n="15" facs="tcp:105373:12"/>
go together to <hi>Wexford,</hi> where I muſt for
ſometime leave them to direct themſelves as
their ſeveral inclinations lead them.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Major</hi> taking hold of this occaſion and
fearing ſome other diſcoveries, reſolves to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
from thence, acquainting his dear Friend
my <hi>Lord</hi> with the intention at this time ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned
by Mr. <hi>Cheevers,</hi> and finding how apt
the People were to cenſure him he would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to prevent the like for the future, by
making known that he was the Son of ſuch a
Father as he profeſſes, and no <hi>Counterfeit,</hi> as Mr.
<hi>Cehevers</hi> took the Liberty to term him. In this
reſolution he deſired my <hi>Lord</hi> to do him the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to dine with him before his going away:
to which requeſt my <hi>Lord</hi> made anſwer, that
he had too much friendſhip for him ever to deny
him any thing though ſorry to looſe his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
ſo ſoon, yet could not diſapprove of his
ſo well grounded reaſons. The next day being
appointed, my <hi>Lord</hi> came to the <hi>Majors</hi> Houſe,
ſo did a great many more of the chief of the
Town, all ſeeming to be much troubled to
think that the <hi>Major</hi> is upon leaving them, he
receives them with a great deal of kindneſs,
and promiſes, ſo ſoon as he ſettles his affairs to
return to them again.</p>
               <p>Being at dinner, and in a pretty pitch of
Jolitry the <hi>Major</hi> calls his truſty Servant pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vatly,
gives him orders to be gon to a Place
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:105373:13"/>
called <hi>Roſs:</hi> and thither to carry with him all
his <hi>Trunks,</hi> and <hi>Cloakbags,</hi> with all the goods
he had there, to take Lodgings and wait his
comeing, which was no ſooner commanded,
then with all the ſpeed that could be obſerved.
The <hi>Major</hi> had no more trouble about it who
had nothing now to do, but entertain his
Friends, in which he loſt no time, when (belei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
his Servant to be a good diſtance from the
Town) bethought him of his time to follow,
then calls for the other Glaſs, and begins to my
<hi>Lord</hi> a health, to that poor diſtreſſed for lorne
Priſoner his Mrs. which my <hi>Lord</hi> moſt readily
pledged, and ſeemed much troubled he had not
the Honour to begin it, while healths were go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
round, the <hi>Major</hi> calls for <hi>Boxes,</hi> and <hi>Dice,</hi>
then for his Servant, to bring him Mony, whom
he knew to be ſome Miles from thence, which
my <hi>Lord</hi> obſerving, bid his Purſ-bearer to give
the <hi>Major</hi> Forty Pound, or what ſumm he
would have: which the <hi>Major</hi> made uſe of a
while, then left one in his place, as if called up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in haſte, took Horſe and went away follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
his Servant (without noiſe) to <hi>Roſs.</hi> My <hi>Lord,</hi>
and his Company at play wondered at the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jors</hi>
ſtay, then calls for a Glaſs, and drank his
health, giving him commendations by the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen,
till at the laſt the company began to grow
weary; called for their Servants to attend
them to their ſeveral homes, ſome to lead, and
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:105373:13"/>
ſome to carry, but before they part, the Maſter
of the Houſe appears with a long <hi>Bill of Fair</hi> in
his Hand; which the ſoberer part of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
(as my <hi>Lord,</hi> and ſome few others) ſeeing,
asked what he meant by it, he told them he
knew not who to call to for his Mony; that the
<hi>Major</hi> had been in his Houſe a good while, and
never gave him Penny yet: nor did he now
know where he was, or what became of him;
and that he hoped his Lordſhip, and theſe Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen
would not ſee him undone</p>
               <p>§ The Gentlemen looking one upon another,
wondering, were all ſtrook dumb! Come,
come ſays my <hi>Lord,</hi> it is not not to be ſuppoſed
much leſs believed, that a perſon of Honour
and Quality would do an unhanſome thing;
therefore let us ſuſpend our opinions till we
hear farther: for I dare ſay there is ſome extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
accident that occaſioned this ſuddain
departure or there never had been this cauſe of
complaint; however he is my Friend, and ſhall
ſuffer nothing in my preſence, and for your Bill
of Fair my Man ſhall pay you preſently. The
Man was called, <hi>Major Clancie's</hi> debt of two
and Twenty Pounds paid, the Company parted,
my <hi>Lord</hi> to his Houſe: the Gentlemen to their
homes, and the <hi>Major</hi> to <hi>Roſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§ I muſt now for ſome time leave this good
Company, and return to the poor diſcontented
Priſoner, whoſe unacquainted paſſions bred
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:105373:14"/>
ſuch a diſtemper in her, that ſhe fell ſick of a
Fever: but by the Indulgent care of a ſond
Mother, ſoon recovered of that diſtemper. She
ſtudies nothing naw, but how ſhe ſhall make
ſome Reparation to her beloved, and conffirm
him in an Opinion of her conſtancy; this ſhe
contrives to do by a <hi>Letter:</hi> ſends it by her
<hi>Foſter Siſter,</hi> (whoſe care is not queſtioned) ſhe
delivers the Letter to the <hi>Major</hi> at his Houſe
in <hi>Roſs,</hi> who no ſooner read it, but puts himſelf
into a poſture to comply with the Contents,
which ſignified her ſorrow, for the ſeperation
occaſioned by her ſelf, and that ſhe knew not
how to repair it otherwiſe, than by giving him
this Teſtimony; that if he pleaſed to come to
ſuch a place, at ſuch an hour, with half a Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen
Horſes; ſhe would not fail to meet him,
reſolving to be for ever after at his <hi>Diſpoſe</hi> (I
ſuppoſe I need not mention how he was Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
with joy when he received this comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<hi>Letter,</hi> or how plentifully he rewarded the
meſſenger that brought it, and carried back his
Anſwer) after diſpatching the meſſenger, he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
takes Horſe, and goes unto <hi>Wex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi>
where the memory of this <hi>Prank</hi> was
yet freſh.</p>
               <p>I know not whether I may call it confidence,
or impudence; but into my <hi>Lord of Crafford's
Chamber</hi> he goes, who welcomed him as <hi>Cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully</hi>
as if his <hi>Lordſhip</hi> had received many obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:105373:14"/>
from him; the <hi>Major</hi> finding his recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to be ſuch as he could not in reaſon have
expected from any Body, began to make his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe,
attributing the misfortune of ſo abrupt
a departure to an accident that ſuddainly befell
him, which my <hi>Lord</hi> would hear no more of:
why then my <hi>Lord</hi> ſince you are ſtill my beſt
Friend, pray read this <hi>Letter,</hi> which he did, and
and then asked him, what Service can you ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
me capable to do in this occaſion. Only
to lend me your beſt Horſe. That I conceive will
not be enough (ſays my <hi>Lord</hi>) for here ſhe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rects
your coming not only well Hors'd; but
well accompanied with half a Dozen Horſes;
'tis pitty but ſhe mould be obſerved: which
(for her ſake) I will adventure firſt to go. You
ſhall have my Gray Horſe for your ſelf, and I
with my Five Servants will wait upon you, this
being a buſineſs could admit of no long delay.
My <hi>Lord</hi> orders the matter ſo, that in a very
little time they are all on Horſe back, marching
fairly to the place appointed by the Lady, who
failed not to doe her part in coming at the hour
according to her promiſe. After ſhe had ſaluted
the kind lover, over joyed; my <hi>Lord</hi> told them
this was no time or place for dalliance; ſo to
Horſe ſhe went, they as before, and ſhe behind
her Servant. Where was interchanged ſome
glances of Love-looks, while they had leiſure;
which was not very long, when Mr. <hi>Cheevers</hi>
                  <pb n="20" facs="tcp:105373:15"/>
upon notice of the Deſign gathers all his forces
together, purſues the party, for whom they
were too hard; yet they diſputed their intereſt
like men of Honour. But Mr. <hi>Cheevers</hi> ſoon
decided the quarrel, though not without bloud,
which (he might the better do) being ten times
their number. In ſhort, the Lady was reſcu'd,
the <hi>Major</hi> wounded, and my <hi>Lord</hi> taken Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner;
the <hi>Major</hi> eſcaped by the goodneſs of
his Horſe, which in little time brought him to
<hi>Roſs:</hi> where he lies under the hands of his Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgion,
the Lady is made Priſonner the ſecond
time, with many threats of puniſhment for oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioning
all this buſsle: as alſo the breach of
promiſe in the Garden; my <hi>Lord</hi> is led into the
Common-dark-hall; where he walks up and
down in Querpo (like a priſoner of War)
without Hat, Cloak, or Sword; the place not
affording ſo much light as to let them ſee who
it was, till Mr. <hi>Cheevers</hi> coming in thither in
ſtate with <hi>Torches</hi> carried before him, who ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
my <hi>Lord of Crafford</hi> in this poſture: asked
him Pardon a Thouſand times, and wondered
extreamly to ſee his Lordſhip there, blameing

to diſtinguiſh between my <hi>Lord</hi> and others:
my <hi>Lord</hi> (who knew very well what did belong
to Fighting, and how few Ceremonies of that

People; who immediately brought him his

Sword, and all that they had taken from him;
and ſet his Servants at Liberty; Mr. <hi>Cheevers</hi>
is now at quiet, believing the ſtorm now over
his Daughter is reſcued, and ſecured from any
farther Attempts of the <hi>Major,</hi> ſo as he only
bends his endeavours wholly to entertain my
<hi>Lord;</hi> who he hopes will appear no more in
countenancing the <hi>Major,</hi> in a thing ſo preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial
to that Family; this he expreſſed in his
diſcourſe to my Lord, who made Anſwer, that
what he did in aſſiſting his Friend, was not to
prejudice him in the leaſt, but that it was his
conſtant Cuſtome never to fail that Friend
to whom he once profeſſed Friendſhip. Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
being ended, they believing my Lord weary
after the Counter-ſcuffle lighted him to his
Chamber, and ſo left him to his reſt. Who
next Morning betimes takes his leave and

               <p>All things in this place ſeem now to be
at eaſe, ſave only the reſtleſs condition of
the poor Priſoner, whoſe apprehenſions
torment her, not knowing if her ſweet heart
be Dead, or alive; then conſidering how
inſtrumental ſhe was in his misfortunes,
theſe and many ſuch diſtracting thoughts do
ſo perplex her: that ſhe is at her wits end;
(a thing eaſily believed, eſpecially of all ſuch
as either are or have been Sick of her diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe.)
Sometimes ſhe reſolves to make her
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:105373:16"/>
Eſcape, and come to him where ever he is:
again that ſeems difficult, or rather impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible.
Then is ſhe as far to ſeek as ever; at
laſt ſhe reſolves to Write, and commit it to
the care of her <hi>Foſter-Siſter;</hi> this reſolution
takes place: ſhe Writes to let him know
how unquiet her Life is, and how little ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
ſhe has in the World without him;
not knowing what was become of him, ſhe
farther ſignifies, that if he pleaſe (ſeeing
publick meetings will not do) to try a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate,
to come to ſuch a place, at ſuch an
Hour, ſuch a day in the Evening, ſhe would
be ready to meet him.</p>
               <p>This Letter ſhe delivered to the <hi>Foſter-Siſter,</hi>
with promiſes of a large Reward for
her Care. The <hi>Foſter-Siſter</hi> thinking to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
more miſchief, takes the Letter, and
delivers it not where ſhe was directed; but to
Mr. <hi>Cheevers</hi> who read it over and over;
and believing he could make ſome uſe of it,
looks upon the ſuperſcription, as if he had
read it in miſtake, and tells her, this Letter
is not for me, go and deliver it to him
it is directed to, whereupon ſhe goes to
<hi>Roſs,</hi> where ſhe found the <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>jor</hi> lay'd upon
his bed, and gives it him, by which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
ſo great ſatisfaction, that he waited
no longer for his <hi>Plaiſters;</hi> but Writes his
Anſwer, and diſpatches the meſſenger, then
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:105373:16"/>
prepares for the day and Hour appointed
Nor was he more diligent or careful in his
preparation for that meeting, then Mr. <hi>Chee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,</hi>
ſo that when the <hi>Major</hi> was come to
the place, expecting his Miſtreſs there, inſtead
of her whom he expected, he meets a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
of Clubbatiers; that lay in ambuſh
to wait his being on Foot. Who no ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
lighted, but they laied hold of him; and
where he expected Embraces, and ſweet Kiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
they pay'd him with Buffets, and Crab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticks
into ſuch a pickle, as never was any
poor Man before in this poſture. They
carry him to Mr. <hi>Cheevers,</hi> who believed
himſelf ſure of this booty, and therefore
prepared to receive him, not as heretofore,
but with a pair of Stocks, which he had
placed in his Common-hall, purpoſely to be
in Sight of all, both Men and Women, in
the Houſe; with which Sight very few were
pleaſed but himſelf: who reſolved to eat
in the ſame Room, purpoſely to affront the
<hi>Major,</hi> who is now in the Stocks, with his
Clothes torne, his Face buffeted, and his
Head broken. A Sight ſo diſpleaſſing to
the good Miſtreſs. of the Houſe, that ſhe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired
her Husband to mitigate part of this
Rigour, or rather Tyranny; for her part
ſhe was not able to endure to ſee a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of his Quallity and parts thus uſed
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:105373:17"/>
like a Beaſt in her Houſe, and that he
might find other means to Right himſelf,
or prevent the harm he apprehended, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
infringing the Laws, and Rules of hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitality
thus. This ſpeech did in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
mollify the unreaſonableneſs of Mr.
<hi>Cheever's</hi> paſſion; ſo that he turned toward
the Major, and told him how much it was
againſt his inclination to uſe any Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
thus, and that if he would paſs his
Parole, never to proceed farther in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,
or give him any farther trouble in it:
he was ready to reſtore him firſt his Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and then all that had been taken from
him, as his Horſe, and Arms, and all that
belonged to him.</p>
               <p>To this Speech, ſhe Major makes this Anſwer,
Mr. <hi>Cheevers,</hi> it ſhould ſeem (although you are
a very knowing Man) you never read of the
<hi>Knight of the Sun,</hi> or of his Brother <hi>Roſs Clear,</hi>
or of <hi>Rogero,</hi> or any of the famous and brave
Men <hi>at Arms!</hi> how much they ſuffered for
their Miſtreſſes: (if you had, undoubtedly) you
would in ſome meaſure have conſidered me,
who of my ſelf can conſider nothing in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon
to my Miſtreſs for when I Remember,
or call to mind, that what I ſuffer, or endure, is
for her; it ſweetens all my ſufferings. I muſt
confeſs Liberty is a great, and very pleaſing
thing (eſpecially after ſuch hardſhips as has
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:105373:17"/>
been put upon me,) and a thing I ſhould covet
and court. Were it to be purchaſed either by
<hi>Labour,</hi> Coyn, or <hi>Blood</hi> I ſhould not ſtick at it.
But to Relinquiſh my Pretences to my Miſtreſs
as if I would prefer any worldly conſideration
before her, I will never do it, nor is it in the
Power of the whole World to make me do it.
Let them and you, whoſe Priſoner I now am,
Inflict what Puniſhment you pleaſe, it ſhall
never be of force ſufficient to divorce me
from her Service.</p>
               <p>This Anſwer wrought ſo upon the Miſtreſs
of the Houſe, as alſo upon all that heard it,
that it moved them all to Pity (I hope his own
Mriſtreſs was not far off) She never left ſolli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citing
her Husband, till ſhe obtained the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jors
Liberty, then were all the Servants ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
who ſhould do him moſt Service. One
brings Water, another the Towel, another
his Hat: all waited upon him to Supper, and
from thence to his Chamber. Next Morning,
having his Horſe and Arms delivered him in
very good Order, he takes his Leave, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
of the good Lady of the Houſe, that
procured him his Liberty.</p>
               <p>No ſooner did he find himſelf without
the Gate, mounted upon my Lords
Gray Horſe, and his Piſtols fixt before him,
but he turns towards the Door, and vows
with a great imprecation, that no Body ſhall
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:105373:18"/>
paſs that way, but he will have his Life; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
they let him ſee his Miſtreſs before he goes.
This put Mr. <hi>Cheevers</hi> into ſuch a Rage of
Anger with his Wife; You ſee, ſays he, what
you have done, by giving this Man his Liberty;
which way will you contrive to pacify him
now? Were it not better to have kept him
where he was? Let me ſee which of all you
that were ſo much his Friends, Dare go and
reaſon the matter with him? Not I, ſays one;
nor I, ſays another; I am not ſo much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd
in the Matter ſays a third; in Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
none of them ſeem'd willing to venture
on ſo deſperate a Man, whoſe Anger they
were not willing to provoke. <hi>At laſt they fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon a Reverend Perſon that was Chaplen to</hi>
Mr. <hi>Cheevers,</hi> who with a great deal of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaty,
took upon him to Argue the matter
with the <hi>Major.</hi> The <hi>Major</hi> ſeeing him come
in ſuch fear, bid him not be afraid, and told
him he ſhould be heard without Danger; and
likewiſe asked him what his Reverence had to
ſay, and whether he ſpoke by Commiſſion, or
of his own accord. The Reverend Father
told him, he came to adviſe him chiefly for
his Souls ſake, and next deſired him to deſiſt
this Sute; for he knew of his own knowledg,
it was to no purpoſe to do otherwiſe. Pray
Father, Replies the Major, do you know more
of her Mind than I do? Hark you Sir, I
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:105373:18"/>
know you are a Prieſt, and therefore Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure
you by all that is Dear to you, to bring
me an Anſwer to the Meſſage you are to
carry, or elſe by the ſame <hi>Oath</hi> you are to
take, I will, without regard to your Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
Piſtol you before you leave this
Place. This great Threat, put the poor
Prieſt into ſuch a <hi>Fright,</hi> that he knew not
what to ſay, or do; only promiſe to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
his Meſſage, and bring an Anſwer:
which was, to let him know, if he may ſee
his Miſtreſs before he go or not. The
Prieſt undertakes it, to return upon the
ſame <hi>Penalty,</hi> in caſe he procure not the
Sight of his Miſtreſs: in whoſe Retreat to
Mr. <hi>Cheevers</hi> and the reſt, you might ſee
the <hi>Greateſt Fright,</hi> the greateſt Conſterna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
that ever Man was in. His own <hi>Shad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow</hi>
was enough to ſtartle him; ſeveral
times thinking as he look'd back, it was the
<hi>Major</hi> in purſuit of him: He no ſooner come
into the Hall, where Mr. <hi>Cheevers</hi> with his
Lady, and Company were, but he throwes
one way his Hat, another way his Books
and Spectacles, lik<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> a mad Man, declaring
his Misfortune in coming into that Service,
hoping now for no other Reward, than to
be killed by Major <hi>Clancie,</hi> ſtill crying out,
what had I to do with your Daughter, or
your ſelf, or her ſweet-Heart? What need
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:105373:19"/>
I to involve my ſelf in all this trouble? I
muſt go back again to be Kill'd. Good
Father ſays Maſter <hi>Cheevers.</hi> be quiet,
and tell us what ails you, what ails me?
cries he; The Devil ailed me, to concern
my ſelf in this affair, wherein I am ſure to
looſe my Life, for if you do not conſent
that he may ſee your Daughter before he
goes, (which I know you will not) I muſt
go and tell him ſo, and am confident ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
to return with Life, for what cares
that Man what Miſchief he does me. Truly
Father, I would do ſo much to ſave your
Life: therefore let me intreat you to paci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
your ſelf, and Believe I will free you
from this Danger you ſo much apprehend,
by letting him ſee my Daughter; but it
ſhall be at ſuch a diſtance, and in ſuch a
place as She ſhall receive no prejudice by it.
So having given this hope of Relief, to the
Reverend Father, with ſome Cordials to bring
him to himſelf) They all walk up to the Caſtle
where, in the middle of a large window,
they held her to be ſeen by the <hi>Major</hi> to the
Middle, at which Sight he rejoyces more,
than if thither came an Angel from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.
In this Poſture, and the Hearing of
all, they gave each other the comfortable
aſſurance of <hi>Conſtancie,</hi> unalterably to be
preſerved by both, during the whole term
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:105373:19"/>
of their Lives. The Major departs and Rides

for the preſent, I will leave in your Cuſtody
one of my Trunks, which I muſt intreat
your care of, till I return you your money;
which I intend to bring you within few
Months.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>White</hi> was in no ſmall trouble at this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt,
not knowing well how to deny, or
grant it, being but newly Married, and that
without the conſent of either his Wives
Parents, or his own; nor did he know what
Mony his Wife had, and therefore deſired
the Majors Excuſe till he went home, and ſpoke
with her; which he did immediately, and told
her how great an Addition to his ſmall For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
he was like to have by the kindneſs
of his new ſound, and moſt dear Friend
Major <hi>Clancie;</hi> who had given him a Farm of
Fifty Pounds <hi>Per Annum.</hi> Rent free, dureing
Life, and only deſired a ſmall Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſie,
the Loan of Fifty Pounds for ſome
Months, and in the mean time would leave
in his cuſtody, one of his Trunks; a
very ſufficient Pledge for a greater Sum.
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:105373:21"/>
The Wife made many Excuſes; at laſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
by her Husband importuned with ſo much
earneſtneſs conſented; delivered Fifty Pieces
in Gold to her Husband, who made all the
haſte he could, and carried it to the Major,
who no ſooner received it; but he orders
the Trunk to be delivered to his good
Friend Mr. <hi>White,</hi> and he to his Wife,
where it is very ſafely, and ſecurely laied.
By this time the whole Company were in
ſuch a height of Jolity, minding nothing elſe
but drinking, that Major <hi>Clancies</hi> Servant
had leiſuer enough to obſerve the directions
he had from his Maſter the day before, to
Watch his opportunity to be gon, with all
the remaining goods to <hi>Kilkenney,</hi> and there
to ſtay, and wait the comeing of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter:
this was very punctually obſerved<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and
performed, a fine thing! a dilligent diſcreet
Servant! of this we hear no more till we
meet in <hi>Kilkenney.</hi> The Major ſeeing moſt
of the Company elevated, begins a Rouz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
health, to put all a ſloat: and before
that health went round, took occaſion to
go down Stairs (leaving one of his truſtees
to ſee fair Play) he walkes fairly on the
Ferry, there being an Arm of the Sea to
croſs: takes boat, goes aboard a Ship that
lay in the Harbour, being well acquainted
with the Captain, who bid him veary heartily
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:105373:21"/>
welcome, repeating his obligations for ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
kindneſſes received at his quarters in
the City; the Major unwilling to make any
long ſtay, told he only came to take his
leave, being upon his Journey toward <hi>Kill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenney;</hi>
ſo having diſtributed to the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
takes his Boat, the Captain with him,
that reſolved to complement him to the
ſhoar-ſide: and ſo return to his ſhip; where
at his going, he ordered half a Dozen Guns
to be given to the Majors farewel; which
made ſuch a noiſe, that the whole Town
allarm'd (eſpecially) the company that
were ſolaceing themſelves by drinking the
Majors health, to whom they were ſo much
beholding; all ſtarted at this ſhooting of
great Guns, not knowing where, or whence
it came: till one coming up ſtairs, tells
them it is a Ship-board; whereupon they all
reſolved to go aboard that Ship that ſhot,
and know what the matter was, which they
immediately very furiouſly did, in company
with the Major of the Town, who was then
with them, and was no ſooner aboard, but
fell ſo fiercely to examine the Captain; all
talking together: being ſo confoundedly
Drunk, ſome threatning to puniſh him, for
putting the Town into ſuch a fright, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
ſeeming to excuſe him, though they
knew not yet for what, or which way; but
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:105373:22"/>
all in ſuch a diſracted confuſion, that the
Captain thought Hell had been broken looſe;
they were ſo diſorderly, that he knew not
how to pacify them, at laſt turning to the
Major and the reſt, he tells them, Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
either be quiet, and hear reaſon, or go
home and ſleep: for I have done nothing
but what is warrantable, and juſt; in gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
a noble perſon a few Guns, being up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his Journey to <hi>Killkenney,</hi> that had been
very civil and kind to me, and bountifull
to my men. I have not been ſpareing of
my Powder upon ſuch an occaſion as this,
to perſons of far meaner quality than
Major <hi>Clancie;</hi> they no ſooner heard the
name of <hi>Clancie,</hi> but were all ſilenc'd, as
if ſtruck mute with admiration, and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
at the Major's departure in that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner;
thus are the People quieted, and the
Captain at reſt: each to their ſeveral homes,
entertaining their Wives with ſtories of
Major <hi>Clancie,</hi> now the only paſtime of
that Place. Whoever was pleaſed with
this Subject for diſcourſe (I do ſuppoſe) Mr.
<hi>Deverox,</hi> the Maſter of the Houſe, where
Major <hi>Clancie</hi> lay, was not, who from the
time of his coming to <hi>Roſs,</hi> to that Hour
never received promiſe of his Money, poor
Man, not knowing which way to turn him,
having ſeveral ways run himſelf in debt
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:105373:22"/>
for the Supply of the Major, from time to
time; whom if he ſhould follow to <hi>Killkenney,</hi>
he is certain to loſe his Labour; if he
ſhall ſtay in his Houſe, he is afraid of
his perſecuting Creditors; who now begin
to call for their Moneys, which the poor Man
has not to give them, nor indeed dos he
know what courſe, or whoſe advice to
take for his preſervation: at laſt he bethinks
him of a way that in appearance ſeems Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible,
and eaſy; which he firſt communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates
to Mr. Maior (being related to him)
that is to Petition the whole Town: moſt
of them one time or other, having part of
his ſpoil at thoſe entertainments made for
them by the Major, deſireing them to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
him as a Native and long inhabitant
of <hi>Roſs:</hi> whoſe deportment none of them
could be a ſtranger to, and that this ſum
of Thirty Pounds muſt unavoidably deſtroy
him, and if that they pleaſed to contribute
toward his preſervation ſo far, as to divide
this ſum amongſt them, which would make
the burthen light to them, the weight of
which muſt break his back.</p>
               <p>§. The Major approves of it, the Aldermen
and Citizens conſented, ſo that the Creditors
are ſatisfied, Mr. <hi>Deverox</hi> repaid his disburſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments:
who now thinks himſelf as Rich as
an yof them; Mr. <hi>White</hi> who quietly hitherto
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:105373:23"/>
liſtened to the ſeveral Complaints of thoſe
that exclaimed againſt the Major, he applau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
his own happineſs, in having that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
in the Major, who had promiſed him
ſo good a Farm, and left him ſo good a
Pledg for his fifty pounds, that he laught
in his Sleeve, at all others.</p>
               <p>One Morning his Wives Fingers Itched
to be at the Majors Trunk, deſired her
Husbands leave to ſave her Longing; He
tells her how unwilling he is to meddle,
leſt ſome of the Majors Goods might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
ſome Prejudice thereby; but ſhe preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
him ſo to open the Trunk, that there
is no denial; only he muſt firſt acquaint the
Maior of the Town, and deſire him to be
preſent for prevention of miſtakes; to the
Maior he goes, and tells him how he had
lent money to Major <hi>Clancie,</hi> who left him
a ſufficient Pledg, and that his Wife being
deſirous to ſee the inſide of it, preſſed him
to open the Trunk; to which he deſired
his Worſhip to come and be a Witneſs to
what was in it; and that no injury ſhould
be offered to the Majors Goods. The Maior
promiſes to be with him at the hour of
three in the Afternoon without fail.</p>
               <p>§. The Maior comes at his hour, with ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
of the beſt in Town, to witneſs this
great exploit; upon whoſe coming the Smith
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:105373:23"/>
is ſent for, with his Tools to break open
the Trunk (which is not long a doing) no

believe were better ſo than ſeen: for
from that piece of Sattin to the bottom of
the Trunk, there was nothing but Brick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bats,
Clods of Earth, and ſuch like; at
which Sight the Maior and all the reſt,
could hardly forbear Laughing.</p>
               <p>§. The Wiſe ſeeing her ſelf cheat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
without any manner of Hope ever to
be relieved; falls a railing at her Husband,
whoſe Patience is now ſufficiently tried.
From Railing ſhe falls to Fighting of him;
ſo that the Maior<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and thoſe others that
came with another intention, had e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to do to part Man and Wife: whoſe
beſt paſtime is to ſcould, imputing the
blame of all their misfortunes, to each other;
a Fate that attends ſtolen matches ſo made
without the Privity, or Conſent of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents.</p>
               <p>§. The Major by this time is arrived at
<hi>Towmond,</hi> where his old acquaintance and
Friends very much admire to ſee the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of his Change, both in Apparel and
Education.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="38" facs="tcp:105373:24"/>
The Gentlemen of that Country are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly
taken with his converſation, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
Mr. <hi>Macnemarroe</hi> of <hi>Ralahim,</hi> a place ſo
often frequented by him, as if it had been
his conſtant dwelling. The conſtant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſort
of Strangers thither ſo common, and
ſo well known, that I muſt ſuppoſe there
needs no other mention of his Hoſpitality.</p>
               <p>One day as the Major was Travelling
the Road near that place, he accidentally
met a Gentleman newily coming into the
Country from abroad, going homeward
where he had not been in ſome years:
longing much to pay his Duty to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
the Lord of <hi>Mountgarrot.</hi> The Major
Accoſts him with ſo many extraordinary
ſigns of Joy, that Mr. <hi>Butler</hi> marvelled at
the ſuddenneſs of this great Intimacy upon
the firſt acquaintance; which the Major per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving,
told him, Sir pray wonder not at
my Preſumption, nor my Tranſport, till I
have unfolded the Cauſe. Firſt, I had the
Honour to know you in ſuch a place in
<hi>France,</hi> where you were pleaſed to own me
for your Servant. The next is, my great ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to
meet you here, from whence you ſhall
not go (if I may prevail ſo much with you)
till you t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>oroughly inform your ſelf what
my Fortune is, that am nearly related to
you, by my Marriage to your near Kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:105373:24"/>
Daughter to Mr. <hi>Cheevers</hi> near <hi>Wex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi>
where I have been laſht with the
cenſure of being a Counterfeit; which I hope
you will ſoon be able to remove. My houſe
is not far from hence, whither I muſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat
your Company.</p>
               <p>§. Mr. <hi>Butler</hi> told him he had not time to
ſpare at preſent, and that he would rather
chooſe to come on purpoſe from his Fathers
Houſe to wait upon him at his own houſe,
than loſe one hours time now: and that
he would go to his Couſin <hi>Cheevers</hi> pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely
to remove that Doubt, and cenſure:
and give ſuch a Character of him, as ſhould
render him capable of a better Opinion
both with Mrs. and Mr. <hi>Cheevers</hi> and all
his Friends. For his own part he deſired
nothing more than an opportunity to renew
this his Acquaintance, and return this Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility;
and withal aſſured him, how glad he
was of his Alliance. After the exchange of
many expreſſions to this purpoſe, Mr. <hi>Butler</hi>
abſolutely refuſed to go to his new Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance
and Couſins houſe, by whom he
was very much importuned.</p>
               <p>The Major ſeeing he could not prevail,
preſſes him with much earneſtneſs, to take
a Bait with him, at another houſe of his,
lately let to an Uncle of his, a Gentleman
of that Country, of a very good Family,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:105373:25"/>
and good Eſtate; one Mr. <hi>Maccnemarroe,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
juſt in his Road to <hi>Limerick:</hi> whither
Mr. <hi>Butler</hi> intended to go that Night, and
Major <hi>Clancie</hi> reſolves to wait upon him,

Mr. <hi>Butler</hi> did not much ſcruple then, being
willing to obſerve his Couſin.</p>
               <p>§. To <hi>Maccnemaroes</hi> houſe they are come, led
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>hither by the Major, who has that obſervance
and ready Attendance from the Servants in the
Abſence of their Maſter, that he believes them
to be <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncle</hi> and <hi>Nephew</hi> in good earneſt. The
Deſign of calling <hi>Maccnemarroe his <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncle</hi> was,
that Mr. <hi>Butler</hi> ſhould ſee he had Relations of
Quality, and likewiſe take ſome notice what
care, and at what diſtance he was obeyed here;
they are plentifully entertained, the place being
always provided for ſuch occaſions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Healths
go very quickly about to Miſtreſſes and Friends
ſo faſt, that they ſcarce take notice how
the time goes; notwithſtanding Mr. <hi>Butlers</hi>
haſte. They had not been long at this
ſport, when one of the Servants came run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the Major, to tell him that his
Maſter, <hi>Maccnemarroe</hi> was allighting at the
Gate: the Major askes Pardon and Leave of
Mr. <hi>Butler,</hi> to go and wellcome his Uncle
who is come to the Gate. Down he haſtes,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:105373:25"/>
and after Salutation, tells <hi>Maccnemarroe</hi>
what a Gueſt he had brought to the houſe,
believing it to be a great diſparagement to
the whole Country, if ſuch a perſon as my
Lord of <hi>Mountgarrot's</hi> Son ſhould paſs tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
without Entertainment. Mr. <hi>Maccne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marroe</hi>
Imbraces him, and gives him many
thanks for that great favour. The Major
tells him farther, how he had made Mr.
<hi>Butler</hi> believe, that <hi>Maccnemarroe</hi> and he
were <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncle and Nephew,</hi> to the end he
might not wonder at his Intereſt there, nor
the power he had taken upon him, which
<hi>Maccnemarroe</hi> deſired him to continue, and
looſe no time from that good work of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaining
that Gentleman, in which he
would give all the Aſſiſtance he could, by
ſurrendring to the Major all the power he
had in the houſe: which the Major very
readily, and gravely took upon him: into
the Houſe they both go together, where the
Major preſents to his Couſin <hi>Butler,</hi> his

that the Major had a Deſign upon
ſome Lady of Fortune, in which Mr. <hi>But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler</hi>
                  <pb n="42" facs="tcp:105373:26"/>
might be uſeful to him, which made
him uſe all the means he could to promote
that Intereſt, and ſettle ſuch an intimacy as
might be neceſſary upon ſuch an occaſion.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Butler</hi> thinks it high time for him
to be gone, who, notwithſtanding all the
Arguments that are uſed both by <hi>

Nephew,</hi> and <hi>Couſin,</hi> perſwading him to ſtay
for ſome time, at leaſt this Night, reſolves
for <hi>Limerick with his Couſin Clancie:</hi> who
upon this Reſolution, borrows his Uncles

aſhamed to deny him in the hearing of
Mr. <hi>Butler,</hi> before whom he had been ſo
kind, and had confeſſed his Relation: ſo
lent the Horſe and his Groom to attend him,
with money in his Purſe, leſt either might
have occaſion to uſe it.</p>
               <p>§. To <hi>Limerick,</hi> goes Mr. <hi>Butler,</hi> accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied
with his well-beloved <hi>Couſin Clan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie:</hi>
who is now bravely mounted, and well
attended by two Servants, his own, and his
Uncles: his Intereſt in his Couſin <hi>Butler</hi> is
grown ſo great, that he can perſwade him
to any thing (though never ſo contrary to
his own Inclination) inſomuch, that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
his haſte to ſee his Father, the
Major wrought with him to ſtay in <hi>Limc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick,</hi>
eight or ten days: moſt of which
time, if not all, was ſpent in good fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:105373:26"/>
with ſome new Acquaintance. <hi>Clancie</hi>
being by this time almoſt weary of this
place, and Company, begins to think of a
way to get handſomly from thence, in order
to which he calls the Groom, who was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
to obey him, and bids him go to
the Weſt-Gate, and ſtay there for him, and
leave the Bay Horſe in readineſs for him.
As ſoon as the Groom was gone, he calls
his own man, and bids him go towards the Eaſt
Gate of the Town, out of the Grooms
way, and about an hour after to come to him
with ſome Story orother, by which he might
pretend Excuſe to part this place and Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>his
Man being very apt, and quick of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension,
and well verſed in his Maſters
ways, ſoon underſtood his meaning; ſo went
his ways.</p>
               <p>§. The Major returns to his Couſin <hi>But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler,</hi>
they had not been together above an
hour after breaking their Faſt, to which they
had taken a large Mornings-Draught, when
in comes the Majors Man, like one half
out of his Wits, which he taking notice of, ſays
to his Couzen <hi>Butler,</hi> I think my Man is
Drunk; what is the matter with you Sirrah?
You look as if you were either Mad or
Drunk? Whence came you, that makes you
ſeem thus diſtracted? The Man being So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
and not <hi>Barren-witted,</hi> tells him, it were

who with a great many more of your Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants,
are flocking with their Complaints
to you: and you ſpend your time here.</p>
               <p>The Major bids him go to them, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid
them to enter the City: and to tell
them he would immediately go to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners,
and ſee them have Reparation;
with this ſeeming Reſolution, he riſes from
the Table, borrows his Couſin <hi>Butlers Scar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let
Cloak,</hi> Garded with Gold-Lace, his fine
<hi>Embroidered-Belt and Guilt-Rapier,</hi> goes down
Stairs, and with much Expedition takes his

to wait for him: whoſe Heels may cool be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

this matter: upon entrance into their Room,
after a cold ſalute from all: one of the

extreamly troubled to hear himſelf
thus ſcandalouſly reproacht; had ſcarce the
patience to forbear interrupting the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners:
at laſt makes Anſwer: that he
conceived he had very hard meaſure to be
thus cenſured before he was heard; and that
he ſcorned to have a hand in Cheating, as
much as any of them that charged, or any
other perſon in the World: as for joyning with
Major <hi>Clancie,</hi> he was ſo far from giving any
Countenance upon any Deſign; that meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him but lately upon the Road, he took
from him Mr. <hi>Butlers</hi> Cloak, with the Sword and

to reſtore them to Mr. <hi>Butler;</hi> who being

Mr. <hi>Maccnemarrhe</hi> could not hold to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
his reſentment in ſuch Terms, as gave
ſo much offence to the Commiſſioners; that
they thought fit to Commit him; but before
he was carried away, they asked him why
he did not bring the Major, as well as the
Goods; to which he only replied, he had no
Commiſſion.</p>
               <p>§. The Commiſſioners knowing very well
Mr. <hi>Maccnemarroe</hi>'s Life and Converſation,
to be very far from the giving occaſion for
any the leaſt ſuſpition, intending not to
keep him under a Reſtraint any longer, ſent
for him, and aſſured him it was for no ill
opinion they had of him, or ill Intention to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
him, made them continue him: only for
the jeſt ſake, and deſired him to take it ſo;
with which he reſted ſatisfied, onely deſired
from them an authority to apprehend and
bring before them that Villain that occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him all this trouble, and bitter reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es.
That they readily granted, with direction
to the Sheriff of the County, to be aiding

takes his leave, begins his way toward
<hi>Galleway:</hi> Imagining that to be the likelieſt

carries him away to <hi>Limerick</hi> to the Commi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners,

Mr. <hi>White</hi> in <hi>Roſs</hi> being told of this, obtains
a Warrant from ſome perſon in Authority,
that Major <hi>Clancie</hi> ſhall be ſent from Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable
to Conſtable till he be brought to
<hi>Roſs,</hi> to be gazed by all that have ſeen him
in his Bravery. There revenge is ſweet,
though without hope of ever ſeeing his
fifty pounds again, about the time that the
Major was brought as far as <hi>Caſhel</hi> in his
way.</p>
               <p>§ The Earl of <hi>Inſiquin</hi> in perſuit of the
Ulſter Army under the Command of Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
<hi>Owen Onele,</hi> chances to quarter at a
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:105373:30"/>
place called <hi>Farmbridg,</hi> near <hi>Caſhel,</hi> where
the night ſeeming very tedious to him, he
deſired a Gentleman then in his Company,
ſomewhat acquainted with the Courſes of
Major <hi>Clancies</hi> Life, to entertain them with
ſome paſſages to divert them; which the
Gentleman did, and continued his narrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
ſo long, that after many fits of Laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
they found they were all aſleep; and
he talking to the walls, then thought it
time for him to ſleep too, they all ſlept
heartily till morning, though upon bare
Boards.</p>
               <p>§ Next morning betimes there comes a fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
to the Door, the Centrey challenged
him, and bid him ſtand; asked him what
he would have? whither he would go?
he anſwered he would fain ſpeak with a
Gentleman that was with my Lord: the
Centrey told him he ſhould not, that it
was an ill time now; for they were all aſleep.
The fellow preſſed very hard for an admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
or at leaſt to have his meſſage car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
up to the Gentleman: whereupon the
Souldier asked what his name was; he told,
that his name was <hi>Clancie,</hi> at that the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman
with whom he would fain ſpeak
knew him very well: they both ſpake ſo
loud that my Lord and the Company heard
them, and did verily believe this to be that
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:105373:31"/>
Perſon ſo much talked of, the night before.
Whereupon the Gentleman ſo inquired af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
goes down to ſee who it was; and ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a man almoſt ſtark naked, without Hat
or Cap, without Cloak or Coat, without
Doublet, Shoe, or Stocking, or any other
thing in the World; only a pair of Breech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
with many Patches, and a Shirt ſuitable
and fit to be worn with ſuch a pair of
Breeches: ſo dirty as if it had been dipt
in a Kennel, in ſo much that the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
knew him not, Major <hi>Clancie</hi> perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that his diſguiſe had altered him from
the Gentlemans knowledge, diſcovers him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
to the Gentleman; who immediatly car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
him up to my Lord in that very po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture:
the memorey of the laſt nights Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
with the ſight of him in this Habit, put
Lord and Gentleman into ſuch a ſit of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment
and Laughter that ſome were forced
to leave the Room.</p>
               <p>§ The Major gives his Friend a Petition to
preſent to my Lord, which the Gentleman
took, but before I delivered this Petition
if you would have this Gentleman to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
for you, pray oblige them with the
relation of ſome Paſſages of your Life, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cialy
ſuch and ſuch; being the Stories he
had told the night before; which the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman
would have needs confirmed by the
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:105373:31"/>
Major himſelf: who did it ſo exactly well,
and with ſuch additions, as made them all
ſo taken with him, that they joyned in the
requeſt of his Petition, wherein was ſet
forth how that the Major and his Predeceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors
having had there an ancient relation,
out of mind of dependency upon his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips
Houſe, and Family, and that he hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of his Lordſhips being in the Field in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit
of <hi>Owen Onele:</hi> came to wait upon his
Lordſhip; being ſome days before well pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
for ſuch an occaſion, being very well
Mounted, and well Armed. But meeting
with a number of diſorderly Highway-men, as
he took them to be, was rob'd of all he
had, and left in the poſture you now ſee him
in: the ſumm of his requeſt therefore is, that
his Lordſhip will be pleaſed to give him a
Paſs to goe through the Countrey to <hi>Lime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick,</hi>
where he means to recruit himſelf, and
return to wait upon his Lordſhip in this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition:
which my Lord at the Intreaty of
all that were preſent granted; <hi>Clancie</hi> takes
his leave of all the Company, particularly
his old Friend: and finding a Horſe of very
little valiue (or a Garran more properly
ſpeaking) which he thought fit for his Turn,
provides him a bundle of ſtraw for a Saddle,
a rope of Hay for his Bridle, and thus he
rides in State into the County of <hi>Limerick:</hi>
                  <pb n="54" facs="tcp:105373:32"/>
where he was ſo well known, that the people
believed he had broke Goal, and by that means
had made his eſcape: ſome run to apprehend
him anew, who upon ſight of his Paſs from
the Lord <hi>Inſiquin</hi> were glad to let him alone.
To his Lodging he rides without interruption:
ſends for his Barbers, prepares to be Bath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and Trimed, and being provided of Cloaths
was ſoon in condition to be admitted into
Company.</p>

               <p>THe Major is now returned unto <hi>Lime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick,</hi>
free from his fears of more reſtraint,
the only Gallant of all the Town, the moſt
pleaſing, and beſt welcome Company that
can be: no Company pleaſed without him,
he ſeemingly reſolves a new courſe of Life,
clearly to reclaim himſelf from his long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
Vicious and moſt diſhonest Practices:
declaring in all Companies how apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:105373:32"/>
he is of his former carriages, and how
juſtly puniſhed for them, by which he is made
ſo feelingly ſenſible, that there can be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
though of never ſo great value, of power
ſufficient to make him attempt to the preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice
of any man for the future. To ſecond
this reſolution, and make the World be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
what an uncounterfeited Penitent he is,
he ſeldom miſſes being at Church, at thoſe
hours of Devotion appointed for the Godly:
this was ſo generally obſerved, to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable
Wonder of all that ſaw it, as
hardly believed when reported to thoſe that
ſaw it not, and were no Strangers to his
former Life: that it occaſioned a reſort of
ſome that had a deſire to ſatisfie their cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity,
by the ſight of this unexpected refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
eſpecially the Commiſſioners of the
<hi>Revenew,</hi> who had not long ſince commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
him, and are in ſome doubt whether
they ſhall believe their own Eyes or no:
the chief of theſe Commiſſioners meeting Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor
<hi>Clancie</hi> at his conſtant, and never fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
place, and hour of Devotion; invites
him to his Houſe, where his welcome was
evidenced by the chearfulneſs in each ones
countenance, both of Men, and Women;
the <hi>Majors</hi> carriage more and more confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all men in an opinion of his conſtant re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution,
never to ſwerve from his pious Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions:
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:105373:33"/>
having no other reparation to make
for his many and great Tranſgreſſions, than
for ever to ſhun all occaſions of tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
left his frailty might be wrought up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Theſe and many ſuch like expreſſions of
his, at all times, and in all Companies, had
ſo firmly fixed the opinion of his Hearers,
in an aſſurance of his reality; that there
needeth no further teſtimony; or tryal.</p>
               <p>§ This Commiſſioner (Mr. <hi>Fanning</hi>) was ſo
taken with the Company and converſation
of Major <hi>Clancie,</hi> that he could not be one
meal without him, and in a token of his
extraordinary ſatisfaction, deſired him to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
his Trunks to be brought thither<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and that he himſelf would remove his quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
to that Houſe where he ſhould have
the abſolute Command of all. The <hi>Major</hi>
returned him hearty thanks, accepted his ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
kind Offer; and immediatly came with
his retinue to Mr. <hi>Fannings</hi> Houſe; where he
has ſo inſinuated himſelf, as well with Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,
Miſtriſs, and Servants, that there is no
man commands more. In ſo much that what
ever he will have done by the Servants is
obeyed, and approved of by the Maſter.</p>
               <p>§ This Gentleman Mr. <hi>Fanning</hi> being upon a
Purchaſe of a parcel of Land, from one Mr.
<hi>Obryen</hi> in the County of <hi>Clare;</hi> had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
a meeting at Mr. <hi>Obreyens</hi> Houſe,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:105373:33"/>
upon ſuch a day, to conclude the Bargain
by paying one hundred pounds, as an earn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
penny, there to ſign, and ſeal accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to agreement: in order to which they
prepare of all ſides; Mr. <hi>Fanning</hi> for his
Journey thither, and Mr. <hi>Obrien</hi> for his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception.
Mr. <hi>Fanning</hi> in his way, after ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
ordered his ſervant to follow him with
the hundred Pound to Mr. <hi>Obryen's</hi> Houſe
it is ſtill to be obſerved, that the great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timacy,
or rather the great fondneſs that
Mr. <hi>Fanning</hi> has of Major <hi>Clancie,</hi> muſt
needs ingage him to make one at this meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
without whoſe preſence there can be
no ſatisfaction to Mr. <hi>Fanning</hi>) As they ride
along, each one entertain'd with their ſeveral
diſtinct thoughts, Major <hi>Clancie</hi> obſerving
the man that had orders to follow with the
hundred Pounds was not come up to the
Company; ſlackens his pace, and waits for
him, being prepared with a coulorable, plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
Story: with which he acoſts the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant,
telling him how angry and impatient
Mr. <hi>Fanning</hi> was for his long ſtay: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
he ſent me back with orders for your
return to <hi>Limerick,</hi> with all the ſpeed you
can make (though you were forced to take
a freſh Hore) there you are to go into his
Cloſet, where you ſhall find behind the right
hand leaf of the Window, in a piece of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:105373:34"/>
rold up twenty Pounds in Gold: which
he intended to bring in his own Pocket to
give to Mr. <hi>Obryen:</hi> you are likewiſe to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver
me the hundred Pounds to lighten
your Carriage, that you may come the ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
to Mr. <hi>Obryens</hi> Houſe, where your Maſter,
and we all expect you; this requires haſt,
which your Maſter commands you by me.</p>
               <p>§. The Servant not queſtioning the matter
farther, being very well ſatisfied that all is
real, and true that comes from the <hi>Major,</hi>
whoſe intereſt in Mr. <hi>Fanning</hi> was well known
to all the Servants; particulerly this very
Perſon; delivers him the hundred Pounds,
rides back to <hi>Limerick</hi> as hard as he could
drive, gets one of his Fellow-Servants to
make ready another Horſe; while he goes
up ſtairs to finiſh what he comes about.
But when he came to the Cloſet and found
the Door ſhut, and Lockt, he was at his
Wits end; not knowing what to do, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to break open the Cloſet-door, or go
back without the money: at laſt after ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Changes in his reſolutions, and appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending
that the want of this money (for
ought he knew, might break off the <hi>Bargain</hi>
with Mr. <hi>Obryen</hi> which he ſo often heard
his Maſter commend, reſolves to break open
the Door, which he could not eaſily do
without ſome help; goes to the Window,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:105373:34"/>
ſearches every paper, and every corner ten
times over: but could find no Gold, which
put the poor innocent Fellow into ſuch a
conſternation, that he falls a curſing of both
Maſter and Major, ſo vehemently that he
was troubleſome to all the Houſe: till in
the end his Miſtriſs was forced to uſe her
power to quiet him, who was not a little
troubled to ſee her man in this diſorder,
her Husbands Cloſet-door broken, all his
Papers toſſed moſt confoundedly. Then to
think of her Husbands diſappointment put
her into ſome diſorders too.</p>
               <p>§. The Fellow runs down ſtairs like a Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lam,
rides whip and ſpur into <hi>Twomond,</hi> to
Mr. <hi>Obryens</hi> Houſe; where he finds his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
full of ſtrange apprehenſions for his
long Stay, ſometimes pacified by <hi>Mr. Obryen,</hi>
telling him that his nonpaiment of the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Pounds ſhould be of no prejudice to
him in his <hi>Bargain;</hi> but when the poor di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted
Fellow, almoſt weary of his Life,
appeared, and his Maſter asked him what
the Devil ailed him to ſtay thus long: put
the Fellow into ſuch a rage, that he hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
gave his maſter leave to ſpeak, but very
ſnappiſhly anſwers him thus: Sir you may
very well ask me what the Devil ailed me,
for ſure enough it is the Devil, or I had
never been tormented thus, upon ſo little
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:105373:35"/>
ground, or reprehended thus only for obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
having done nothing but by your own
orders, brought me upon the high way by
<hi>Major Clancie:</hi> commanding me to make all
poſſible haſt back again to <hi>Limerick,</hi> there
to go into the Cloſet: where I ſhould find
behind the Right-hand leaf of the Window,
in a piece of Paper, twenty pieces of old
Gold, which you intended to bring in your
Pocket to give <hi>Mr. Obryen;</hi> which I did ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly,
and when I came thither, found
the Cloſet Door lockt, which I was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to break open, and after long painful
Search, not only in the window, but in
every corner, where I ſaw but a piece of
Paper; thinking it might be that I came
for, till wearied off my Legs, I quitted the
Search, and followed you hither; to give you
this Account; at which Mr. <hi>Fanning</hi> was aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed,
believing his Man to be Drunk, or
out of his Senſes; having in all the Diſcourſe
made no mention of the hundred pound;
whereupon, he ask'd him if he were not
Drunk, or Mad and poſſeſſed with the Devil
in good earneſt? Or what elſe made him
talk of a Cloſet, and a Window, and of
twenty pounds of Old Gold; of Mr. <hi>Obryen</hi>
and <hi>Major Clancie?</hi> Sure thou art Raving?
But where is my hundred pounds, which
ſhould have been now given to Mr. <hi>Obryen,</hi>
                  <pb n="61" facs="tcp:105373:35"/>
and was this Morning delivered you to be
brought hither for that purpoſe? Truly Sir,
ſaid he, I gave it <hi>Major Clancie</hi> according
to the Orders he then brought me. But
ſays <hi>Mr. Fanning,</hi> where is the Major with
the money? How can I tell Sir, that never
ſaw him ſince? but ſure I am my Heart is
broke. Thy Heart broke, you Villain, where
is my money? To which he could have no
other Anſwer, but that the <hi>Major</hi> had it;
who it ſeems is gone about his own Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs.</p>
               <p>§. The whole Company are now put to Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
at the ſuddenneſs and ſtrangeneſs of
this Accident. Mr. <hi>Fanning</hi> not believing
there could be ſo much Ingratitude in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
to requite all his Kindneſſes thus:
the reſt endeavouring to pacify him, parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
Mr. <hi>Obryen;</hi> by telling him, this ſhould
in no wiſe hinder him of his Bargain; and
that any other time ſhould ſerve for the
Payment of the money as well. Mr. <hi>Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning</hi>
is abſolutely bent for Revenge, vow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Puniſhment of the Major to the full:
the reſt of the Company diſperſe, ſome
laughing heartily at the ſeeming Artifices
uſed by the Major, with the ſtrangeneſs of
his Succeſs in all his Attempts: others
more concerned for Mr. <hi>Fanning,</hi> pitied
him. This was not ſo privately carried,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:105373:36"/>
but it is ſuddainly brought to <hi>Limerick,</hi> and
many other places, where all People, from
the higheſt to the loweſt, make it the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of their Diſcourſe and Paſtime. Mr.
<hi>Fanning,</hi> ſeeing there is no remedy for the
preſent, muſt Arm himſelf with Patience,
and ſtudy how he may have his Revenge,
and Recover his money: ſometimes he advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
and conſults his fellow-Commiſſioners,
what Courſe is beſt to take, and how far
the Law will warrant his proceeding in
this Caſe. One is of Opinion, that he
will but loſe his time and labour in Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution
of ſuch a Perſon, that has not
wherewithal to make him ſatisfaction. Others
are of Opinion it is fit to make ſearch, and
find out the Offender, both for Example to
others, and in ſome meaſure the ſatisfaction of
Mr. <hi>Fanning;</hi> for probably though the Law
will not bear the hanging of him for this
Fact, yet there are puniſhments ſufficient
and warrantable. To this Opinion all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree;
whereupon Mr. <hi>Fanning</hi> iſſues forth
his Warrants into all parts for the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending
of Major <hi>Clancie,</hi> in ſearch of whom
there is much time ſpent, and labour, at
leaſt half a year to little purpoſe; ſo that all
begin to give over the ſearch and Thought
of him. One day it fortuned, Mr. <hi>Fanning</hi>
having occaſion to Travel toward the <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:105373:36"/>
of Cork;</hi> that a Gentleman in his Company
Riding a good diſtance before him, obſerved
<hi>Major Clancie</hi> coming along the Road, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Horſe or Cloak, being lately come from
<hi>Galloway,</hi> where he had loſt at Play all he
had in the World. The Gentleman Rides
back to Mr. <hi>Fanning</hi> and tells him, Major
<hi>Clancie</hi> is now at his Diſpoſe, walking up
that Hill. Mr. <hi>Fanning</hi> makes haſt to meet
him, and at firſt Sight, was ſo enraged,
that he had ſcarce power to tell his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentments:
Yet told him ſufficiently of his
baſe, unworthy, ungrateful Carriage to one
that had been ſo kind to him, and uſed
him more like an only Child, than a Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.
But now that I have you, I will make
you know your Villany. <hi>Clancie,</hi> who ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
wanted Impudence to make his Defence,
(though in never ſo unjuſt a Cauſe) would
needs excuſe himſelf: but Mr. <hi>Fanning</hi> would
not hear him ſpeak, has him put on Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back
behind one of his Servants, Pinion'd
ſo faſt, that he left him no hopes of Eſcape:
and to be ſure of his long lookt for Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
he defers his Journey to <hi>Cork,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns
to <hi>Limerick</hi> to ſee the Major in ſafety in
the Dungeon, with Orders to the Jaylors
to uſe him Rigorouſly, where he is kept ſo
cloſe with ſuch a weight of Irons, and ſo
ſlender Fare, and continued in that manner
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:105373:37"/>
ſo long, that he abſolutely deſpairs ever to
eſcape that impriſonment, till he is carried
to his Grave. No Mediation or Interceſſion
now prevails; no hopes of Comfort left;
only the expectation of his Torments will
ſoon end, with his moſt miſerable Life,
which he hourly wiſhes for, all that he can
ſtudy or Aim at, or that his Torments
will give him leave to think of is, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
himſelf for another World, where he
muſt account for what he has done. In this
now appears plainly to him the tranſitory<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of things, how little Comfort or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation
can be hoped for here, where there
is nothing permanent; but all ſublunary.</p>
               <p>The Jailor being the only perſon privy to
his moſt ſecret thoughts: drawn to ſome
pitty and commiſeration by the long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
Sighs and Groans of the poor and
akeing-hearted Priſoner:gives him privatly ſome
Eaſe, by taking part of his tormenting Irons
off; other times relieving him with ſome
ſmall Crumbs of comfortable Bits of Meat;
and ſuch like Acts of Charity: really belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
his ſtay could not be long in his Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtody:
but that Death muſt ſoon eaſe him of
his Burthen. One day the Jailor coming to
viſit his Priſoner, asked him if there was any
thing he would have done, or any Meſſage
he would have delivered to any Friend, or
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:105373:37"/>
Relation of his, or if he had a Will to
make, either by Word or Writing: if ſo,
he was very ready and willing to do him
all the Service he could. To which the
Priſoner made Anſwer; no, only gave him
thanks for that Offer of his, and his many
other Kindneſſes, which he doubted not, but
God would reward him for; one Requeſt I
have to make, and to none but you, that is,
to conſider me as a Dying Man, who now
wholely and ſolely bend my thoughts and
works to make my Peace with God, in order
to which, that you will not deny me your
Aſſiſtance, chiefly in bringing me the Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior
of the Franciſcans, <hi>Father Delahyde,</hi>
that I may make my Confeſſion before my
hour come; which cannot be long now,
that he may be aſſiſtful to me in this great
Work.</p>
               <p>§ The Jailor made all the haſt he could,
leſt the Priſoner ſhould die before he return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
<hi>Father Delahide</hi> having heard much of
<hi>Major Clancie,</hi> wondred at ſuch a Charecter
as the jailor gave of him, preſſing with ſo
much earneſtneſs the <hi>Reverend Father</hi> to come
away in haſt; who is no ſooner entred the
Priſon, But is ſtruck with wonder at the
ſight of the Major, whoſe durance, hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
and Pain, reduced him to the moſt
lamentable Spectacle in the World: no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:105373:38"/>
but Skin and Bones; his Eyes ſunk,
his Lips dried up, his Jaw-bone ready to
pierce the Sin; a direct Anatomy, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
Ghoſt; with ſo little Breath, as he
was believed would onely ſerve for this
ſhort time of Confeſſion: which the Major
begins, having examined the whole courſe
of his Life, from the beginning to that
hour, with ſome uncounterfeited Zeal, ſo
much ſeeming Sanctity, ſo ſtrong Reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of amendment; in caſe of Life (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to expectation) with ſo hearty Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
that the Reverend Father admired
him as the trueſt Penitent he ever met with,
and having pronounced Abſolution, ſent
preſently to his Convent for a Cordial, to
prolong the Majors Life if it could be, and
where the Major begged his Reverence to
come once a day to ſee him, the Father
ſeldome ſtayed one hour in a day from him,
for the oftner he came the better he liked
the Converſation, or rather Recantation of
the Major, never mentioning holy things, in
which he took ſo much ſatisfaction that he
believed it an acceptable and meritorious
work to preſerve him, and believed himſelf
obliged to endeavour it.</p>
               <p>One day Father <hi>Guardian</hi> went to ſee Mr.
<hi>Fanning</hi> and the reſt of the Commiſſioners,
who all received him with a great deal
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:105373:38"/>
of Reſpect and kindneſs, and asked him if
his <hi>Reverence</hi> had any Service to command
them. He ſaid his chief buſineſs was to ſee
them; and withal told them where he had
been, to ſee one of the Wonders of the
World; one he believed had not his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
in the World ſor true Penitency and
perfect Devotion. One of the <hi>Commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners</hi>
asked who it was, he told him it was
the very Picture of ſorrow and Repentance,
Major <hi>Clancie.</hi> Mr. <hi>Fanning</hi> ſtarts up, and
wonders that any Man would mention him
for any Good; but he had ſo generally abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
mankind, nay thoſe that had befriended
him moſt, he betray'd ſooneſt.</p>
               <p>To which the Frier replies, how merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
God is, and how Men ought to imitate
and follow his Example!</p>
               <p>This Subject occaſioned a long Diſcourſe,
that at laſt wrought upon Mr. <hi>Fanning</hi> ſo
far, as to grant <hi>Father Dallahide</hi> his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt;
which was, that <hi>Major Clancie</hi> ſhould
be brought before the Commiſſioners, and
there be heard ſpeak for himſelf: Orders
were ſent to the Jailor to bring him. The
Jailor makes Anſwer he may as well bring
the Priſon upon his Back as the Priſoner
in his Bolts, that is hardly able to walk
without a ſupporter; if he had all other free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome:
whereupon he is commanded to take
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:105373:39"/>
his Irons off, and bring him with ſome
Souldiers to attend him. The Crowd in
the Streets was ſo great, that the Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
had ſomething to do to clear the way
for this walking Ghoſt; who with much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do
is brought before the <hi>Commiſſioners,</hi> who
were moved to ſome compaſſion at the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
of this lamentable Spectacle: <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Dellahide</hi> break the ſilence firſt, and
turning to the Major, tells him, my Child,
I have perſwaded theſe Gentlemen to hear
you; therefore what ever you have to ſay,
ſpeak it freely. I humbly thank your <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence,</hi>
and theſe worthy Gentlemen; I
have not much to ſay, but only this, that
I cannot but apprehend how I muſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoidably
ſubject my ſelf to the Laſh of
Cenſorious perſons, who will undoubtedly
reproach me with the ſcandalous Terms of
Flattery, in repeating what I have juſt reaſon
to believe, that God is well pleaſed with all
theſe Gentlemen that have ſo juſtly puniſhed
and impriſoned me, whereby I come to know
my ſelf; and call to mind my many for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Errors, and Tranſgreſſions ſo often
committed, with which I might have ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarded,
if not abſolutely purchaſed, perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
Damnation; from which, I hope that
God will now defend me. Nor do I peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
Life or Liberty, leſt I might never be
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:105373:39"/>
ſo prepared for my End: only deſire ſo
much Eaſe from thoſe Tortures, that I
might ſpend the few hours I have to live,
in the Exerciſe of thoſe Admonitions I have
from my Ghoſtly Father. If I cannot ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
this, I ſubmit with ſatisfaction, that
ſome will take Example by my deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
Puniſhments, and amend their Lives,
which I heartily wiſh all good Chriſtians
may do. With theſe and many ſuch Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions
the Major wrought ſo upon all the
Crowd of Hearers, that ſome wept for Pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
others wiſht it in their powers to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſe
him; more eſpecially Mr. <hi>Fanning,</hi> who
now begins to liſten to the Interceſſions of
Father <hi>Dallahide,</hi> and the reſt of the
<hi>Commiſſioners.</hi> In Concluſion, Mr. <hi>Fanning</hi>
turns to the Frier, and tells him, Father
you have wrought a great Miracle, for my
own part I am glad if I have contributed
any thing to it; as for thoſe injuries I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
by the Priſoner, I very freely forgive;
upon the aſſurance that he will prove a new
Man, as we have all Reaſon to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
he will: I therefore beſtow him up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
you. Whereupon is expreſſed a great
deal of gladneſs through the whole Town.
The Jailor is diſcharged, <hi>Major Clancie</hi> is
led along in Company of Father <hi>Guardian.</hi>
to the Monaſtery, where he is received af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:105373:40"/>
the wonted Ceremony of the place, and
Orders.</p>
               <p>§ It is a conſtant cuſtome, and an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
Rule, that no body muſt take upon him
the Habit of St. <hi>Francis,</hi> till he firſt ſerve out
a year oſ probation, or Novelſhip, which
<hi>Major Clancie</hi> with all humbleneſs did, and
is granted his Petitions; ſor where he is em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd,
behaves himſelf with ſo much hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility,
that there can be no Employment, or
Office ſo mean or ſervile, but he moſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
undertakes: as for thoſe Exerciſes of
Devotion, no Man can be more punctual.
<hi>Father Dallahide</hi> is ſo very fond of Brother
<hi>Clancie,</hi> that he appoints him to lie at his
Bed's feet, leſt he might by Overworking after
his late Impriſonment, bring himſelf into any
Fit of ſickneſs, that his Cordials might be
in readineſs at his Call. Brother <hi>Clancie</hi> is
now in his Novelſhip, a profeſſed Frier in
the Order and Habit of St. <hi>Francis,</hi> and
Chamber-Fellow to <hi>Father Guardian,</hi> who is
ſometimes diſappointed of his Reſt by that
continual Exerciſe of Mortification practiſed
by <hi>Brother Clancie,</hi> who every Night to
torment and cool that wanton Body of his,
pulls off his Habit, and rouls himſelf up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the cold Ground, and when ever he hears
the Cock to Crow, falls a whipping his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
Body, till commanded by <hi>Father Dalla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hide</hi>
                  <pb n="71" facs="tcp:105373:40"/>
to forbear thus rigorouſly to torment
himſelf; aſſuring him that to preſerve him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
were it but for example would do
much more acceptable ſervice to God, than
to make himſelf away, and deſired him
withal, to remember how lately he came
out of Priſon, and how ſeverely dealt with
there, and how it brought him ſo low,
that he could hardly crawl, and therefore
would have him Cheriſh, and Nurſe
himſelf till he recovered his former ſtrength.
In this manner ſtood Affairs for ſome time.
Brother <hi>Clancies</hi> Diligence more and more
engages the Affections of all his Brother-Friers,
eſpecially <hi>Father Guardian,</hi> who ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
or never goes any where without
him, chiefly when he goes to preach to his
Congregation, to whom he often Declares
as undeniable Truth, what had been told
us by our Predeceſſors, in order to the
Amendment of our Lives, and preſervation
of our Souls. Yet knowing how incident
and natural 'tis to all Men, to be more ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
and give more Credit to what they ſee,
than what they hear, I muſt here take leave
to point out to all your Views, the wonderful
and almoſt miraculous work of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty,
in the clear and perfect Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of one of the looſeſt livers in the world.
I hope, for your examples, as his own pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:105373:41"/>
who had heretofore ſo plentifully
taſted the pleaſures of the World in every
form Mans wiſhes could propoſe: nor did his
want of Youth deprive him of hopes to
continue ſo; yet being toucht with a timely
Remorſe, by which the vanity of the World
was made appear to him, quits all hopes of
the pleaſures of this World; for the poor
begging habit of St. <hi>Francis;</hi> wherein he now
ſits at the foot of the <hi>Pulpit,</hi> at which all
the People look, knocking of their hands
and breſts for admiration, ſtill liſtening to
the Preacher; who purſues his Story, by tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
them how ſtrangely ſtudious poor Brother
<hi>Clancie</hi> is, to find out unheard of puniſhment; in
hope thereby to make ſome reparation, to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe
the Pardon, and expiation of his Crime,
for the tranſgreſſion of his Youth. I my ſelf
that am a Fryer, and a Preacher theſe two and
thirty years, am now glad to learn new
ways or Mortification of my poor Brother
<hi>Clancie.</hi> Thus did this good and reverend
Father continue of giving attributes of Praiſe
to Brother <hi>Clancie,</hi> who by this time is
very well verſed in the ſeveral ways of both
<hi>Clergy,</hi> and <hi>Laity;</hi> one thing he obſerved
to the rule in the <hi>Monastery:</hi> not to reſerve
for the next Meal, (yet being diſpenſed with
becauſe of the War) they of that <hi>Monaſtery</hi>
had got a little ſlock of mony together,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:105373:41"/>
from their charitable Neighbours, which Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Clancie</hi> knew of; who finding an opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
by the abſence of Father <hi>Guardian,</hi> goes to
brother <hi>Spencer,</hi> who was then their Caſh-keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
and told him that Father <hi>Delahyde</hi> being
with the Commiſſioners, they had promiſed to
do them a very kind piece of Service, which
was, to employ their own Servants to the Fair
of <hi>Mollengare</hi> to buy lean Cattle for the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Proviſion, and would give them Graſs till
they were fit to be eaten, to which end Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Delahyde</hi> ſent me for that little money, to
deliver to the Commiſſioners for that Uſe, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Spencer</hi> believing all this to be true, deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
him the money, being threeſcore Pounds;
he no ſooner had it but he carries it to a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Lodging, where he puts off St. <hi>Francis's</hi>
habit, puts on his other Cloaths, and bids
adieu to his benefactor Father <hi>Delahyde,</hi> and
all the reſt of his dearly beloved Brother-Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers;
as ſoon as the Guardian came in, his firſt
enquiry was for brother <hi>Clancie,</hi> being always
very tender of him, asked him how he did,
and where he was?</p>
               <p>§ Truly ſays Father <hi>Spencer</hi> he eat his
Dinner heartily; for my part I have not
ſeen him ſince he brought me a meſſage from
you. From me a meſſage? what do you mean
by a meſſage? for I have not ſeen him this
day, are you ſure you do not miſtake? I
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:105373:42"/>
am ſure Sir he brought me your Order to
deliver him over our little Stock of Money
to be carried to the Commiſſioners, who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed
to ſend their own Servants to the
Fair of <hi>Mollengare:</hi> and there to buy lean
Cattle, and that they would beſtow Graſs
to ſeed them, till they were fit for us to
eat. <hi>God bleſs us</hi> ſays Father <hi>Delahyde,</hi> I am
afraid you are Drunk, or have loſt your
Senſes. Should I be Drunk, that have not
taſted any manner of <hi>Liquor</hi> this day? what
then? what makes you talk at random thus
of the Commiſſioners. of <hi>Mollengare</hi>-Fair,
of Servants, of <hi>Lean cattle</hi> and God knows
what? Sir I know no more, I do but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat
his own words, he may give you a
better Account which I ſuppoſe he will do
when he comes in. But have you given the
money in earneſt? yes truly have I. And
do you not know where he is? no in good
faith not I. Why<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> then I am afraid we
are all undone.</p>
               <p>§ This laſt Act of the Major's to the
great diſappointment of the reverend <hi>Father,</hi>
and the reſt of his <hi>Friers,</hi> and Fellow-Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferers,
ſoon ſpread up and down the Town,
that it came to the Hearing of the Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners,
who next day came to ſee his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence,
and condole his great Loſs. Mr.
<hi>Flanning</hi> begins to enquire for Brother <hi>Clan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie,</hi>
                  <pb n="75" facs="tcp:105373:42"/>
that Example of Humility, that Pattern
of Penitence: inlarging ſo upon that Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
till Father <hi>Delahyde</hi> much out of coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance,
beg'd him not to torment Him
with thoſe reproachful Sentences, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petitions
of his irrecoverable Loſs; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
this was ſent for their Puniſhment,
and Trial of Patience, who have no reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
but Leave it to God. Father <hi>Spencer</hi>
ſtanding by, and hearing him ſay he would
leave it to God; being troubled, replies there
ſhould be no ſearch for <hi>Clancie,</hi> leave it to
God, and if this wicked Fellow comes
with one tear of Repentance, God will for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give
him. But what ſhall we do in the
mean time for Meat? at this the People fell
all a Laughing, till the Company parted,
each one to his Home entertaining their
Selves, and Friends with thoſe Paſſages for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
repeated.</p>

               <p>MR. <hi>Clancie</hi> concievs it not ſafe for him
to make any ſtay in them Parts,
where he had ſo lately play'd ſo many
Pranks, and had incenſed ſo many Perſons
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:105373:43"/>
of Quality; who would undoubtedly have
apprehended him, were it but only in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge
of poor Father <hi>Delahyde,</hi> injured ſo:
believing <hi>Limerick</hi> too hot a place for him,
to take his Journy toward the County of
<hi>Keary</hi> a place he never had been in before,
there makes his inquiry as well of Names
of Places, as the Inhabitants, and having
thoroughly informed Himſelf in every parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular,
he likewiſe inquires who thoſe People
were that liv'd in the Wood, and upon the
Mountains, and what ſhift they could make
for their Lively-hood, and Subſiſtance?</p>
               <p>§ Anſwer was made him that moſt of them
were Gentlemen of good Rank, Men of
great Courage, and Reſolution, put now to
ſo much Hardſhip, that unavoidably they
muſt be very Burthenſome to the Country,
troubleſome enough to the Neighbouring
Garriſons, having no Pay or other ways to
live but what they muſt take by force from
their Enemies, their Friends not daring to
relieve them. He farther enquires which
was the next Garriſon, and who command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
there? it was told him that <hi>Cork</hi> was
the next; the Governours own Name he
knew not. Pray do you know any of the
Gentlemens Names that live near <hi>Cork?</hi>
can I have admittance into the City? yes Sir,
I know Mr. <hi>Ocallechan,</hi> and ſeveral others
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:105373:43"/>
that pay Contribution. After this Informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
the Major goes toward <hi>Cork,</hi> to a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemans
Houſe with whom he had ſome ſmall
acquaintance; who bids him very welcome,
and gave him good entertainment, which
the Major makes this Uſe of, and tells him
that the occaſion of his coming thither was
to make Uſe of his kindneſs, in a Buſineſs
he was very confident would be very accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
to all Men, and injurious to none:
whereupon the Gentleman of the Houſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes
to do him all Service. Why then Sir
my requeſt is, That you will do me the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
as go to the Governour of <hi>Cork,</hi> and
tell him that I am a Perſon that have a ſmall
Command amongſt thoſe Gentlemen that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but be troubleſome to him, and his
Quarters; and if he will give me good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions,
in order to my Tranſport, and
thoſe under my Command, I will wait up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him, provided he firſt ſend me a ſafe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
by you. The Gentleman of the houſe
was very glad of the occaſion; believing it
a very welcome Meſſage, goes next morning
to the Governour: who kindly thanked him,
and immediatly gives him a ſafe Conduct
for Captain <hi>Clancie,</hi> and deſires him to bring
the Captain to his Houſe, and to aſſure
him he ſhould have good conditions, and
ſhall be very punctually performed. The
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:105373:44"/>
Gentleman returns to the Captain with this
account, who without delay comes to the
Governours Houſe in <hi>Cork:</hi> where he is moſt
nobly feaſted, his company very pleaſing to
all: no ſooner Dinner was done, but Captain
<hi>Clancie</hi> deſired a private conference with the
Governour, where he reaſoned the matter,
ſo ſignifying how reſolute all his party were,
and abſolutely reſolv'd to revenge their ſelves,
in caſe of no relief: ſuch of them as had
not the intention with Captain <hi>Clancie,</hi> who
likewiſe tould him how neceſſary he would
be in this caſe; whereupon the Governour
deſired him to know what conditions would
ſatisfy him? Sir I would not willingly be
counted unreaſonable to a Perſon ſo obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gingly
civil as your ſelf. I would have a
ſafe and free Quarter for my Men and Horſes
during our ſtay here, a good Ship well
Mann'd, and Victualled, to tranſport us to
our Harbour beyond Sea, with ſome mony in
our Purſes to ſerve us upon our arrival,
which I will leave to your diſcretion.</p>
               <p>§ Truly Captain I can but commend your
care of your men; nor do I find ſo much
of unreaſonableneſs in your Demand, and to
diſpute any farther, but grant all you deſire;
all which was preſently reduced into Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
ſigned by the Governour, and deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Major, who no ſooner finiſhed his
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:105373:44"/>
complement to the Ladies, but he takes his
leave of the Governour, and thoſe Officers
with him, goes along with his Friend in whoſe
Houſe he had lain ſome nights before, and
from thence to the Mountains: where he
was very well known to a great many there,
begins to wonder at their manner of living,
without Meat, without Drink, without Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
Some anſwered though their Fare was
bad, yet their Cauſe was good, and others
anſwer, would God for all the goodneſs of
our Cauſe, we knew where to eat and drink
one hearty good Meal; to which <hi>Clancie</hi>
makes anſwer thus: Gentlemen I muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs
I pity you. Pity us? a plague take your pity,
could you help us to ſome Meat. I do aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
you Gentlemen if you would be but ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
by me, I would ſoon help you to Meat, and
Drink enough. They all that were there
preſent reſolved, and vowed to obſerve him,
and his orders in what ever he would com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
them, (provided they law a proviſion
made for them with any manner of ſafety)
ho tould them that if they would but own
him for their Captain, he would warrant
with his life to provide for them as he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed,
to which another makes Anſwer He
liked the motion well enough, if he knew
how to believe <hi>Clancie:</hi> with whom he had
been well acquainted before; whereupon
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:105373:45"/>
                  <hi>Clancie,</hi> to remove that Doubt, produces the
Articles he had made with the Governour
of <hi>Cork.</hi> Upon ſight of which to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of threeſcore and ten of them, call him
Captain, and march along with him through
the Country very ſafely, being every where
much made of, a far pleaſanter, and ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
way of living than on the Mountains.
Thus they march to the gates of <hi>Cork,</hi>
where they are received, and provided for
by the Governour: who preſently upon their
Arrival appoints each one his Quarter,
where they are to ſtay till the Wind ſerve:
there being no other Lett, the ſhip being
in readineſs, and the mony that was articl'd
for, paid to the Captain.</p>
               <p>§ Soon after this the wind ſerved fair for
their Voyage, the Governour ſees all clear,
and aboard, waits upon Captain <hi>Clancie,</hi>
wiſhing him a good Paſſage. The Captain
having civily returned his thanks, ſet Sail, of
whom we hear no more, till his Coming
with his Troop into <hi>Flanders.</hi> Where ſome
of them asked him for the ſhare of their
Mony given him by the Governour of <hi>Cork</hi>
for theirs Uſe? He told them that what mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
was given him was for his own Uſe, and
not theirs. But they not ſatisfied with this
Anſwer, reſolved to have it out of his bones,
and threatned him, ſo that he was glad to
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:105373:45"/>
get from them by ſtealth, and leave his Troop
to ſhift for their Living, who not knowing
where to follow, diſperſed ſeveral ways to
ſeek their Fortunes apart.</p>

               <p>THe Major is by this time got into a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moteſt

had intelligence of a very Fair, and Rich
Widdow, to whom he reſolves to make his

and not to look upon him as mean,
though peradventure his Habbit, and retinue
might ſpeak him ſo, which ſhe ſhould find
upon enquiry.</p>
               <p>§ The Lady with a great deal of modeſty

might ſerve for an anſwer: not that ſhe miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believ'd
what he had ſaid, or ever inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to queſtion tho matter, only that ſhe
knew not how to be rude to any Man;
and that at preſent ſhe had ſome occaſions
called her away. This he took for an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement
to come again, which he often
did without Invitation. One day meeting
with ſome of his Acquaintance of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
of <hi>Ireland;</hi> he imparts this Secret, by
which he queſtions not, but to be ſhortly
enabled to relieve them from their neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitous
condition, and put himſelf into a very
ſplended poſture. This reliſhed ſo well,
that theſe Gentlemen asked if they or any
of them by their attendance upon his Perſon,
or any other way could be ſerviceable to
him in this affair? he told that was not
it, but the only thing he wanted to carry
on this deſign, was ſo much mony as would
furniſh him with ſome Aparrel; that he might
not always appear in one Dreſs.</p>
               <p>§ Truly ſay they our ſtock you know can
not be great, yet howſoever we will devide
with you upon ſuch an occaſion as this, that
cannot be every where had. He ingages
that they ſhall never have cauſe to repent

<pb n="83" facs="tcp:105373:46"/>
having already made ſo fair a progreſs,
they make up forty pound between them;
which they very chearfully gave him. He
no ſooner had it, but he forthwith quits his

his Friends ſtrangely diſappointed of this great

               <p>§ Major <hi>Clancie</hi> having heard the diſcourſe
as ſoon as Dinner was done, and Reckoning
paid, call'd for ſome Wine to entertain his
Friends: to which he invites theſe two Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
to whom he had made himſelf ſo known:
that before they parted he contracted ſuch
a Friendſhip, as if they had been of long ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance:
inſomuch that they were ſworn
Brothers. They had not ſpent many hours
in this new purchaſs'd Brotherhood, when
he told him, Brother, if I am not miſtaken
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:105373:47"/>
I heard you wiſh for a Friend that would be
true to you, and could help you to your
money upon your Arrival in <hi>Paris.</hi> If that
be a Service to you, I am ſure I can help you;
for there is a noble Perſon there, that has
a conſiderable ſum of money in his hands,
that ſhall pay you upon ſight of my Bill.</p>
               <p>This the Earl of <hi>Insiquin,</hi> a Man very well
known to be Reſponſable and juſt, and if
you pleaſe to make a farther enquiry as tis
ſit you ſhould, you will find this true. The
Gentleman hearing the name of <hi>Inſiquin</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
the thing withour any more ado, and
told the Major he had two hundred Pounds,
one he would carry about him, the other he
ſhould have: whereupon the Major draws his
bill with a very careful earneſt Letter of
credence, with which the Gentleman was
very well ſatisfied, and delivered the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
when the Reckoning was paid: The
Company parted; The Major about his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs,
the Gentleman to prepare for his Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.</p>
               <p>§ How that he is gladly eaſed of the
burthen of his money, into ſo good a Hand,
who no ſooner Arives at <hi>Paris,</hi> but comes
to my <hi>Lord of Inſiquin,</hi> delivers his Bill, and
Letter. My Lord ſeeing the name of <hi>Clancie:</hi>
could hardly contain himſelf from laughing.
So that he was forced to make an Apology,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:105373:47"/>
by telling the Gentleman that the many
former ſtories that he had heard, and known
of Major <hi>Clancie:</hi> being brought freſh by this
Bill, and Letter into his memory, was the
cauſe he could not forbear laughing; and
withal told the Gentleman how ſorry he
was that any Gentleman ſhould fall into the
Hands of ſuch a known Cheat, and for his part
he never had money of <hi>Clancies</hi> in his Life, and
that withal his heart he pittied the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man:
not knowing how to adviſe him for the
recovery of his money, other then to make
what haſte he could back again to <hi>London.</hi>
where probably he might find Major <hi>Clancie</hi>
before all the money were ſpent. This was
ſuch a ſuddain ſurpriſe to the Gentleman,
ſo contrary to his expectation, that he nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
knew what to ſay or do: ſtood ſtock
ſtill like an Image, or Statue without Lfe,
or Motion. But upon ſecond thoughts, and
ſerious conſideration, he reſolves to take my
Lords advice; this being a Buſineſs could
admit of no long deliberation.</p>
               <p>§ And after a very little reſt and ſome
ſmall repaſt, he takes poſt, and rides back
to <hi>London,</hi> where he finds the Major that
dream'd not of his return in the leaſt, and
riſing ſuddainly from the Company to wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
his Brother, meets half a dozen Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liffs,
that handled him very roughly. The
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:105373:48"/>
Gentleman hearing him call Brother, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers
him with a curſe, a plague take all
ſuch Kindred: in brief, the Major is carried
to Priſon, wihout making reſtitution of any
money, having little or no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e about him;
Where he had not been above ten days, but
he makes love to the Marſhalls only Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
with ſome ſucceſs: ſo much as gave him
admittance, and oppertunity to make his pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tied
Paſſion known; he had a familiar ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance
with the <hi>Daughter</hi> of the Great
<hi>Earl of Twomond.</hi> To whom he takes the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
to ſignify by Letter the State of his
condition as a Priſoner, without hopes of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption:
deſiring her Ladiſhip with much
earneſtneſs to continue ſtill his Friend; to
whom he had a very humble requeſt. Which
was, that She would command her <hi>Chaplen</hi> to
come to the Priſon, and hear his Confeſſion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
this requeſt He hoped She would not deny
him, it being the great concern of his Soul;
The Lady did ſo. The <hi>Chaplen</hi> puts on his
Diſguiſe, and came to the Priſon, where he
was carried to a private Room. The doo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
being ſhut cloſe, he begins to tell the Major
by whoſe command he came, and deſir'd him
to conſider how he, and all thoſe of his Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
were perſecuted; and that he could not
ſtay long, and doubted not but he was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared:</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="87" facs="tcp:105373:48"/>
§ Sir (ſays the Major) I know it very well,
and ſhall not keep you long, my Confeſſion
is but ſhort: I know what you have ſaid to
be very true that you are a <hi>Prieſt,</hi> my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion
is that I want money, which you can
and muſt ſupply before you leave this pIace;
or I will Inform againſt you. The <hi>Chaplen</hi>
was ſo ſtartled at this Confeſſion, knew not
what defence <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o make, finding all his argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
fruitleſs: at laſt was forced to give
the Major all the money he had; being twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
Broad Pieces, and his Bond for thirty
more to be paid at the day agreed upon.
The <hi>Chaplen</hi> goes home to his <hi>Lady,</hi> like
a diſtracted man, to whom he tells what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fel
him, Imputeing the blame of his misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
to her <hi>Ladiſhip,</hi> at whoſe Intreaty and
Command he undertook that unfortunate
Journey.</p>
               <p>§ The <hi>Lady</hi> very much troubled concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
her Self the abſolute occaſion of this
Diſaſter; knew no way to repair this inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
but by paying the Twenty Pounds, and
ingageing for the Thirty, which She imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
did.</p>
               <p>During the time of the Majors Impriſonment,
there chanced to come into <hi>England,</hi> one
<hi>Sutton</hi> commonly called <hi>Duke of Northumber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
the pretended Heir of the Lord <hi>Dudley</hi>
of <hi>Dudley-Caſtle;</hi> who then had a Relation
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:105373:49"/>
in Town, who he often viſited at his houſe,
where he was ſometimes entertained with
Stories of Major <hi>Clancie,</hi> with which the
Duke was ſo taken, that he acquainted the
<hi>French Ambaſſador</hi> with, whereupon, this
Gentleman and Friend to the Duke, was
invited by the <hi>Ambaſſador</hi> to Dinner, where
he was deſired to ſatisfie that Company with
ſome account of Major <hi>Clancies</hi> Life, of whom
the Ambaſſador had heard ſo much, which
the Gentleman did, with ſo much ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
ſeemingly to all the Company, more eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
the <hi>Ambaſſador's Secretary,</hi> who longed
for nothing ſo much as the ſight of this Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor
that was the Author of all this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe,
ſo that when Dinner was done, the
<hi>Secretary</hi> takes one of his Matters <hi>Coaches,</hi>
and ſome Footmen along, and having found
after ſome inquiry, where the Majors Habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
was, makes him a Viſit to the <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhals</hi>
Houſe, where he was Priſoner: The
Major receives him with all the kindneſſes
that could be, and entertained him ſo plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully,
that the Secretary could not chuſe
but wonder to ſee with what Decent order
he was ſerved, upon the ſuddain: as if he
had expected him; and a preparation made
purpoſely for his Reception. Yet there
could nothing be ſo ſatisfactory as the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of Diſcourſe with which the <hi>Secretary</hi>
                  <pb n="89" facs="tcp:105373:49"/>
was ſo taken, that he reſolved to come of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
to ſee him, with intentention to do him
Service. Thus they entertained each other
for that Afternoon, and at parting, uſed ſo
much Courtſhip and Ceremonies, as made
the <hi>Marſhal</hi> believe there muſt be a great
deal of Intimacy and Friendſhip between
them.</p>
               <p>§ The <hi>Secretary</hi> is no ſooner gone, but
the Major, who ſeldome, or never wanted
wherewithal, to put a good Gloſs upon an
ill Cauſe, and reſolving to make ſome Uſe
of this Viſit, puts himſelf into the Poſture
of the moſt unfortunate Creature in the
World; and Acted that part ſo well, that
all the People there preſent, were very
much concerned; though they knew nothing
of the Cauſe: chiefly the Maſter of the Houſe,
who with a great deal of Earneſtneſs preſt
to know the occaſion of this ſo great and
ſuddain a Change? To which the Major
makes Anſwer thus, I know you cannot but
wonder at me, that am indeed the wonder
of the World for misfortune: ſo misfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
that if you knew my Condition, I doubt
you would not Relieve me, though your
Charity might point you to things of great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
difficulty. Yet for your ſatisfaction, I will
not conceal from your Knowledg, the true
State of my Caſe. When I was in <hi>France</hi>
                  <pb n="90" facs="tcp:105373:50"/>
laſt, I did Article with the King, that I
would bring hIm out of <hi>Ireland,</hi> a Regiment
conſiſting of two thouſand Men. On this
depended my Fortune, now croſt by this
curſed Impriſonment. The <hi>French Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor</hi>
not knowing any thing of my Reſtraint,
and much wondering why I did not go with
my Capitulation, ſends his chief <hi>Secretary</hi> to
know the Reaſon why I came not at him,
that he might move all Objections, either
with the Protector or elſe-where; that gave
intterruption to this Deſign. Now you know
the cauſe of my Diſtraction and Trouble,
then judg if I have not reaſon to be ſo, to
ſee the neck of my hopes broke by this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint;
where I cannot promiſe my ſelf ſo
much Liberty, as would give me time to fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
my Buſineſs with the <hi>French Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. All that heard him, could not chooſe
but be concerned for him, eſpecially his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs,
the Jailors only Daughter; who now
made Uſe of her Intereſt with her Father:
alledging ſuch Reaſons and Arguments of
pitty, in behalf of the Major, whole future
Happineſs depended wholly upon this ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable
Imployment, as the Command of ſo
many Men, by which it was not unlikely,
but he might in little time be enabled to
procure his Liberty, and make large Returns
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:105373:50"/>
for the Favour ſhould be conferr'd upon
him; and what pitty it was that a Perſon
of that Honour and Quality, ſhould be thus
reſtrained now in his Diſtreſs: <hi>The Father</hi>
conſidering with great Attention the words
of his dear Child, with how much reaſon
ſpoke, and ſhe was concerned; tells her
how ſorry he was that it lay not in his
power to redeem and free him from all his
trouble, being a perſon for whom he ever
had a very great Reſpect: and whoſe gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
and free good Nature, was well known
to him, ſeeing the <hi>Ambaſſadors Secretary</hi> come
to him in ſuch an Equipage, made him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
all to be very true; whereupon he calls
the Major to him to acquaint him with what
the Daughter had ſaid; and how heartily
ſhe pleaded for him, which indeed had
wrought ſo much upon the good Man, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired
the Major to be very free with him;
and let him know wherein or which way he
could ſerve him, and he ſhould find him a
real true Friend. The Major returns him
moſt hearty Thanks, with an aſſurance of
that his Gratitude ſhould ſpeak it ſelf; ſo as
what ever kindneſs was done him now in his
greateſt neceſſity, ſhould not be counted loſt.
Telling wit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> all, how that the <hi>French Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors
Secretary</hi> told him how requiſite his
preſence would be to go along with the
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:105373:51"/>
                  <hi>Ambaſſador</hi> to the <hi>Protector,</hi> in Order to ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
a courſe for the Raiſing of his Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in <hi>Ireland;</hi> and when that was done,
he was to receive a very conſiderable ſumm
of money, out of which he would not fail
to pay that ſumm for which he lay in Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
and plentifully reward the many kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes
he had received there; and in Order
to the effecting of all this, he deſired no
more, but that the <hi>Marſhal</hi> would be ſo
kind as to let him go to the <hi>Ambaſſador</hi> once
a day, and take his own Parole for his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
at Night. The <hi>Marſhal</hi> told him it
was not uſually practiſed to ſet a Priſoner
at Liberty without Bail.</p>
               <p>Yet that the conſideration of ſo preſſing
and weighty an Occaſion, with the mediati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of his Child to whom he could deny
nothing, had perſwaded ſo far with him,
that he ſhould have his Requeſt, not doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
but the Major would be ſo juſt to him
as not to fail that expectation of coming in
every Night till his Capitulations was finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
by which he hoped to ſee him free from
that and all his other troubles, which
the Major moved to do, by all that was dear
to him in this and the World to come. He
now at Liberty to go every day about his
own affairs, and follow his own Inventions;
comes in every Night very punctually, nor can
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:105373:51"/>
he all this time omit the leaſt opportunity
of making his addreſs to his Miſtreſs the
<hi>Marſhalls Daughter:</hi> who by this time is ſo
wrought upon by thoſe his many Paſſionate
expreſſions, that ſhe reſolves to grant him all
his deſires, provided he firſt give her as an
aſſurance of his conſtancy: that irremovea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Pledge, and ingagement of marriage,
which the Major did not often deny any for,
whereupon they both conſent for many rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
to have it done with as much Privacy
as could be, ſirſt, becauſe it ſuited not ſo
well as affairs ſtood with him, to have the
Marriage, which the Major did Publickly;
and next by reaſon She never conſulted Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
Mother, or Friend; ſo that it is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed
they both muſt meet in a ſecret re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
part of the Town; with very few
Witneſſes, the Thurſday following, where
all things were ſolemnized, to the unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
ſatisfaction of both; after which home
they come; each their ſeveral way without
the leaſt ſuſpition, where they have leiſure,
ſufficient conveniency to meet, and adviſe as
oft as they pleaſe, one day the Major be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in Company with ſome of his own
Crew, notice was given him how that his
Creditor was informed of his liberty, and
that it was intended the <hi>Marſhal</hi> ſhould be
called to an account for it, and that a courſe
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:105373:52"/>
would ſoon be taken to reſtrain him, iſ not
very ſpeedily prevented: he no ſooner comes
to his hour of Loanlineſs and privacy with
his Wife: but he acquaints her with the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign,
telling her with all what his appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions
were, and that he knew no way
ſo ſafe for the preſervation of his liberty
from the Mallice and Proſecution of his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuting
Creditors, as for them both to be
gone into ſome place of ſafety out of the
reach of his enemies. Though he ſcarce
knew how to effect this without her help,
by reaſon of the ſcarcity of Money, occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned
by thoſe ſeveral misfortunes that late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
befel him, eſpecially his laſt Impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
To which She makes anſwer that
She had ſo abſolutely ſetled her heart and
affections upon him, that She will never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline
or forſake him: But will with chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs
go with him into any part of the
World he pleaſes, ſo She may enjoy him,
and bear a ſnare as well in his Sufferings
as his Plenty: and as for his preſent ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply,
She knew of ſome Gold her Mother
had in a drawer, in the bottom of a Trunck
of Linnen, to which She had admittance at
her Pleaſure; and it ſhould go very hard
but She would bring him this Gold to any
place, and at what time he ſhould appoint
with this he was overjoy'd, ſignifying by all

he could ſay or do, the great ſence he had
in his own Happineſs in Her, which he
would not change for the <hi>Empire</hi> of the whole
World. This mutual ſatisfaction was ſealed
with a kiſs, the hour of meeting at <hi>Graves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>end</hi>
apdointed; he goes abroad about his
Affairs, and She about her Deſign, which
She affected that very Afternoon.</p>

far as <hi>Hamſtead,</hi> and leaving Her as their

their concerns at Home, which She was not
unmindful of; for aſſoon as their backs were
turned, She went to the Trunk having the
key in Her own cuſtody, ſo as She could
meet with no Dificulty till She came to the
Drawer; with which She was forced to ſpend
ſome time; and uſe ſome Art before She
could break it open, which She at laſt over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came,
with as little noiſe as She could.
Where She found two ſmall purſes with a
Hundred broad pieces of Gold in each, and
having put the Gold into her pocket, cloſes
up every thing in as good order as She could,

was, that was ſo kind as upon his firſt co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
to viſit your Houſe, to which the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
made anſwer, that this Gentleman <hi>Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior
Gerardo</hi> had been a long time lodged
in his Houſe, and that all his Life-time he
never lodged a Worthier Perſon, or a Braver
Man; nor did he ever know any Man more
generally beloved, and now coming to Town
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:105373:55"/>
with the <hi>Prince of Tuskaine,</hi> to whom he
was a Servant, would not defer that viſit.
Truly ſays the Major I cannot but commend
Him for it, and could wiſh for an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
to be known to a Perſon of ſo much
Worth as you deſcribe, and as he ſeems to
be, and ſhould take it for a great kindneſs,
if you would let him know ſo much. I
may do it with eaſe replies the Maſter; for
I am to ſee him this night by appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
where I ſhall not fail to obſerve your
command.</p>
               <p>§ The hour being come the Maſter went
to ſee his Friend <hi>Gerardo,</hi> who received
him with all the kindneſs that could be,
and after having exchanged their ceremonies
of Joy to ſee each other: the Maſter tells
him of a requeſt he had, that could admit
of no denial; and in the end he ſhould find
it no diſſervice to himſelf. Mr. <hi>Gerardo</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires
to know what requeſt this was that
ſhould need ſo great a preamble; you know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
very well you may command me. Why
then ſays the Maſter, there is a Gentleman
that now lodges in my Houſe, who upon
ſome diſcourſe of you, deſired me to bring
you acquainted; let me aſſure you, you will
not think your time ill beſtow'd in his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany;
he is a Stranger in theſe Parts, and
I believe of far greater quality then either
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:105373:55"/>
his Equipage, or Attendance ſpeaks him:
but is of a very Noble, and generous Spirit,
a free hearted Man and of Good, and very
pleaſing converſation as ever you knew:
this acquaintance (replies Segnier <hi>Gerardo</hi>)
muſt needs be of greater advantage to me
then to t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e Gentleman; and ſhould ſooner
ſue for it: but ſince it happens thus, I will
with much willingneſs give him my atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
to morrow about Mid-day: for we
muſt part by reaſon of ſome buſineſs that
calls upon me, being but newly come, aud
not knowing what our ſtay may be. The
Maſter comes home to his Houſe, gives this
account to the Major his Dear Gueſt; who
gives him many thanks, and deſires him to
prepare for <hi>Segnior Garardo</hi> again that time
of the day, which was done accordingly.</p>
               <p>§ Next day theſe met in the Majors Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
where they were very plentifully enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained,
when the Major and his new ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance
grew to ſuch an intimacy, as no
Brothers could be dearer. After dinner the
Major takes <hi>Gerardo</hi> into his Cloſet, and
there diſcourſes with him of the times, and
asked him if he had lately heard any thing
of the <hi>King of England,</hi> or if he knew any
one of that <hi>Court,</hi> to which <hi>Gerardo</hi> makes an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
how impoſſible it was to conceal from the
World the uſage of the <hi>King of England,</hi>
                  <pb n="102" facs="tcp:105373:56"/>
and for his part he had no knowledge of
particulars, or any acquaintance with any of
that <hi>Court:</hi> but had heard very much of the
conſtancy, Loyalty, and fidelity of the
<hi>Lord of Ormond</hi> in all places, and in all Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies:
but more eſpecially from his own
Maſter, who often gives that noble Perſon
ſuch Characters as were not to be parallel'd.
The Major, as if ſtruck dumb at the very
mentioning of that Name, was ſilenced for
ſo long time; which <hi>Gerardo</hi> perceiving the
ſuddainneſs of his change, and ſeeing him
more concern'd than ordinary; took the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
to ask him if he were not of ſome
near Relation to that <hi>Noble Man:</hi> to which
the Major males this reply, Sir the deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
given by my <hi>Landlord</hi> of your worth,
and the great confirmation I find in your
Self, denies me the power to conceal from
your knowledge my Relation, with what elſe
I have to impart. I muſt firſt intreat your
ſecrecy, and then the conſtancy of that Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
you were pleaſed to profeſs to me, with
this aſſurance that I ſhall ever make it my
ſtudy to requite kindneſſes of this Nature.
I muſt confeſs my ſelf, that Perſon, though
probably not deſerving the Characters that
had been given: and now returning to my
Maſter, am a little pincht, and therefore
muſt intreat you to acquaint the <hi>Prince,</hi>
                  <pb n="103" facs="tcp:105373:56"/>
that I beg it as a favour he will not give
Himſef the trouble to ſee me, nor ſo much
as take notice of my being here; or take it
ill that I cannot wait upon him, other then
by you that are his Servant, and my beſt
Friend. I ſhall not name what ſum to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
me home, other then what can be ſpar'd
with conveniency. This I muſt earneſtly
intreat you to keep to your ſelf from all
Men, but the Prince; not doubting but I
may be in condition to requite your kind
care, as becomes me. I muſt further deſire
that you make no diſcovery by any chance,
or diſtance while we are together; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
me to be your reale Friend; or I ſhould
not have us'd this freedom.</p>
               <p>§ <hi>Gerardo</hi> being ſtrangely ſurpriſed, begg'd
his Lordſhips pardon for theſe errours his
ignorance had led him into, which he would
endeavour to repair by this faithfulneſs in
what Service his Lordſhip had now comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
him, in which he knew he ſhould be
very ſucceſsful, knowing the temper of his
Maſter, and patticular reſpect he had for his
Lordſhip; of all which he ſhould ſuddainly
have an account. Whereupon <hi>Gerardo</hi> takes
his leave, goes to the <hi>Prince,</hi> and ingages
him to ſecrecy: before he would diſcover, or
let him know any thing. The <hi>Prince</hi> won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
what ſhould be the cauſe of all this
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:105373:57"/>
Pudder, and being very deſirous to know
what the matter was, and knowing very
well that <hi>Gerardo</hi> was a ſtay'd ſober Man;
muſt needs have ſome ſtrange thing to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint
him with, which makes the <hi>Prince</hi>
promiſe him as much of privacy as he can
deſire. Whereupon <hi>Gerardo</hi> told him all, how
that my <hi>Lord of Ormond</hi> was in Town in
Diſguiſe, and how he came to know it, and
what diſcourſe paſt between my <hi>Lord of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi>
and him, and what my <hi>Lord</hi> had given
him in command to acquaint his Highneſs
with, in order to a ſupply of ſome money
for this occaſion; and that his Highneſs
would much oblige him in not taking any notice
of his being in the <hi>Country,</hi> and that as ſoon
as his Lordſhip came to the King, his <hi>High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi>
ſhould be ſure to hear from him with
all acknowledgments imaginable.</p>
               <p>§ The <hi>Prince</hi> was ſo ſurpriz'd at this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
that he ſtarted at it, and ask'd <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rardo</hi>
if my Lord would not give him leave
to wait upon him privately, as for any thing
elſe he deſir'd, he ſhould moſt willingly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
it: in order thereunto he commands
<hi>Gerardo</hi> to go back to my Lord and carry
him three hundred Pounds, and bid him tell
my Lord he ſhall have as much more as he
pleaſes, and that there was not that thing
in the World within the compaſs or reach
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:105373:57"/>
of the <hi>Prince</hi> but he ſhould command; and
that, the only trouble the <hi>Prince</hi> had at this
time is, that his Lordſhip forbids him to ſee
him: there being nothing he coveted or long'd
more for then the oppertunity to contract a
real Freindſhip with his Lordſhip. But ſince
it appears to be his pleaſure not to be ſeen
he will obey, only attend his Lordſhip in
his wiſhes.</p>
               <p>§ <hi>Gerardo</hi> returns to the ſuppos'd <hi>Lord of
Ormond,</hi> who receives him with a great deal
of cheerfulneſs, and large promiſes of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward;
ingaging him by all the indearing
terms that can be, to expreſs to the <hi>Prince</hi>
how feelingly ſenſible he is of this great fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
thus ſeaſonably plac'd upon him: which
<hi>Gerardo</hi> promiſes to perform very effectually,
<hi>Gerardo</hi> takes his leave; the Maſter of the
Houſe appears with a ſad countenance to
think of parting with the beſt Gueſt that
ever he had; the Major having paid all his
ſcores, and with an open hand deſtributed
to the people, preſents the Maſter and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs
of the Houſe very largly, deſigning
thereby to raiſe the report and continue the
belief of his greatneſs. At his going to
Horſe he threw money to the ſtanders by,
being his cuſtome ſo to do when his purſe
was full; which by ſome was conſtru'd to
be more for oſtentation, then devotion.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="106" facs="tcp:105373:58"/>
§ He now abounds in plenty, ſo that he
reſolves to deny himſelf nothing his fancy
can propoſe, ſometimes his inclination leads
him to the Wars, where he behaves Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
like a Perſon of a clear courage; and
an undanted reſolution: in places of great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
danger he is ſure to be one of the firſt,
either in charging the Enemy, or making an
Attack, of which there is ſo much notice
taken; as alſo of his free, and unlimited way
of expence, that in little time he acquires a
great Reputation, and a general good opinion
of all his acquaintance: at another ſeaſon of
the year he retires, and makes his abode in
ſome City, where he courts all occaſions to
ſhew his generous diſpoſition: ſo that his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
is coveted by all. Thus he ſpends ſome
years abroad till he underſtood by his corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondent
in <hi>London,</hi> how that his laſt Wife,
being received into her Father and Mothers
boſome, died in Child-birth; which was ſome
encouragement for his comming thither, if
there was no other rub in his way.</p>

               <p>THe Major by this time is thoroughly aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured,
that the King will ſoon come
into <hi>England,</hi> to the unſpeakable ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of his people, of which number he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts
himſelf one, and therefore reſolves
for <hi>London,</hi> to joyn in that great Congra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulation
where he ſoon arrives in a very
ſplended and flouriſhing condition; rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
aparrel'd, and very well attended: he
comes one day to a <hi>Merchants Houſe,</hi> as if
it were by chance (though indeed it was a
contrivance) to carry on another Deſign, with
intention to take ſome <hi>Lodgings;</hi> which the
<hi>Merchant</hi> ſeem'd willing to accommodate:
ſhews him the prime part, and beſt furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Rooms in his Houſe which the Major
could not miſlike; but was ſo well pleaſed
with the ſeveral conveniences, that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers
to his new Landlord, what Rent he
ſhould pay for ſo many Rooms, as he ſhall
have occaſion for by the year; pretending
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:105373:59"/>
that all his ſervants were not yet come
from beyond the Seas, and having made an
Agreement, enquires if the Maſter of the
houſe be Widdower or Bachellor, to which
the Marchant Anſwers, Sir my wife will
wait upon you preſently. The Mrs. appears,
having been all this while making her ſelf
as fine as ſhe could, and preparing a <hi>Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet</hi>
to entertain her new <hi>Gueſt.</hi> Her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
Uſhers her into the <hi>Room</hi> where the
Major was, who is hugely pleaſed that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
is ſo good, to light upon ſuch a place,
and in the diſpoſe of ſo worthy a couple;
during their Diſcourſe the <hi>Banquet</hi> was
brought up, and ſet on the Table where there
was nothing wanting that could be thought
requiſite for ſuch an entertainment.</p>
               <p>The Major asked the Marchant if he
knew <hi>Sir William Rider?</hi> the Marchant
told him that he knew <hi>Sir William Rider</hi>
to be a very worthy honeſt Man; and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Rich. The Major likewiſe asked
him if he knew Sir <hi>Williams Factor,</hi> in ſuch
a Country? The Marchant told him he did.
The Major again asked him if he knew the
<hi>Factors</hi> hand-writing? To which the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant
replied very well: and that he had
been long acquainted with it, having many
times accaſion of Correſpondencie: whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Major draws out of his Pocket a Bill
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:105373:59"/>
of Exchange upon Sir <hi>William Rider,</hi> from his

                  </gap>actor, with a Letter of credence, for five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
pounds; which the Marchant no ſooner
ſaw, but he aſſured him it was as good mony
as any he had about him, and that it would
be paid as ſoon as called for: why then
ſays the Major, pray keep the Bill of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change,
and the Letter, and let me have a
hundred pieces for my pocket mony, till
there is occaſion for the reſt; which the
Marchant immediately brought him; and
told him he ſhould command more at his
Pleaſure. The Major was very well plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
to ſee himſelf have this ſucceſs in all
his undertakings; as alſo with his <hi>Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment,</hi>
his <hi>Lodgings,</hi> his <hi>Landlord,</hi> and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very

whole Buſineſs and Study to Court her to a
good Opinion of him: which in the end
came to be more than ordinary, in ſo much
that before the expiration of many Months,
the Husband began to take notice of their
too much familiarity, and their too often
meeting, which he could not well digeſt;

be the moſt vicious diſhoneſt villainous <hi>Cheat</hi>
in the World: which incenſes the Marchant,
and kindles ſuch a Flame of jealouſy in him,
that he is at his Wits end: and in ſuch
diſorder that he knows not what he had beſt
to do.</p>
               <p>§ To pocket up his apprehended injury
he is not able, to revenge it he knows not
which way; but ſtill inquiring in all Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies,
as well in Coffe-houſes as Taverns,
after the Major, where he never meets a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
that affords him a good word; but the
ſormer Charecter confirm'd by all men. The
Marchant has only his own thoughts to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult
in this great affair, which indeed takes
him wholly off from the conſideration of all
other concerns, he is by chance inform'd of
a private Lodging the Major frequents when
he ſeparates himſelf from company; where
he and Mr. <hi>Berningham</hi> a Comrade of his lie
together; the Marchant at his hours of lone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs,
contriving ſome way to repair part of
his loſſes by the Major: firſt for the uſe of his
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:105373:60"/>
houſe ſince the Majors coming thither, then
for the ſeveral ſums of money from time to
time, with which he ſupplied him: but
chiefly for that irreparable injury which he
dares ſcarce truſt his own moſt ſecret thoughts
with: but ſomething he muſt do or not live.
At laſt he takes a reſolution to revenge him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
upon the Major, which he conceives he
may do with the more eaſe; having found
out his private Lodging, where he intends
to lay hold of him by the rough hands of ſix
Baliffs appointed and hired for that purpoſe.
But firſt he will <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <p>§ To all which ſhe makes anſwer that
it is no ſmall cauſe of wonder to her that
any man could be ſo great a <hi>Counterfeit;</hi>
and that if all this was true, ſhe hoped her
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:105373:61"/>
Husband had more diſcretion then to ſuffer
himſelf to be ſo abuſed; by a Perſon he had ſo
much obliged, and was ſo baſe to requite mens
kindneſſes: by Cheating, ſhe uttered thoſe
words with ſuch a Paſſion, and ſeemed real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſo angry at the Majors ingratitude, and
the fear of her own loſs: that ſhe preſs'd her
Husband with all the eagerneſs that could be
to Revenge himſelf upon that unworthy Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low.
The Marchant hearing all this, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
his Wife had ſpoke nothing but what
ſhe cordially wiſh'd, was extreamly ſatisfied
to ſee, and hear her ſo heartily take his
part, and ſeem ſo little concerned. for the
Major: whereupon he tells her how he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
to revenge himſelf, and prevent his
harm for the future; and that he had his
Writ and his Baliffs ready to apprehend the
Major: in his private Lodging which he that
day found out, and would that night viſit
him, ſhe ſeemed to be very well pleaſed
with the deſign, and deſir'd her Husband
to looſe no time: but to proſecute that baſe
ungrateful Fellow. The Husband goes his
way extreamly well ſatisfied, blaming him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
for having ſo ill thoughts, and mean ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions
of ſo honeſt and ſo Vertuous a
Wife: his back is no ſooner turn'd, but
ſhe immediatly ſends for Major <hi>Clancie;</hi> and
makes him a challenge of unkindneſs for
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:105373:61"/>
his company keeping in his <hi>Private Lodging,</hi>
and never acquainting her: who could not
conceal from him any tiling either of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,

with her, who continues ſo firmly her Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
for him; thoroughly acquaints him with
her Husbands intention, to viſit him at his
private Lodging, with ſix Baliffs that night.</p>
               <p>§ The Major having expreſs'd his thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs
after his wonted manner, tells her
he knows not where to be in ſafety from

the clock at night he comes to the private
Lodging, gives orders to the Baliffs to
handle the Major very Roughly; to beat
him ſoundly, and ſpare nothing about him
but his Life: and in caſe they found his
chamber door not open, to break it open,
and he would ſave them harmleſs. Up
ſtairs they go, and finding the Chamber-door
ſhut, they opened it as they were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded,
and into the Room they croud,
and finding a Man in Bed, cryed out loud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
here he is, we have him. The Marchant
bids them pay him ſoundly, ſpare him not,
which order they readily obey'd, they fall

moſt terribly a beating of him, ſo faſt that
they ſcarce gave him time to ask what the
matter was, or what they meant, or did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to murder him: they cry'd ſtill with e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
ſtroak thou <hi>Rogue,</hi> thou <hi>Raskal,</hi> wee'l
pay thee for all thy Villanies. When they
had done buffiting of his Head, and Face,
with the pomels and hilts of their Swords,
till they had disfigur'd him, he crying aloud
<hi>Murther, Murther,</hi> with which he alarm'd
the People of the Houſe, ſo that they all
came up to his reſcue, and amongſt them
the Marchant, who upon ſight of Mr. <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningham,</hi>
who was the Man abuſed; claps
his Hands, falls upon his knees, begs Mr.
<hi>Berningham</hi> pardon a thouſand times over,
and over to little purpoſe; for Mr. <hi>Bern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingham</hi>
told him in plain, Sir though you
ſeem not to have known me, and that this

of ability to repair me for this abuſe, the
like I believe was never heard: break my
Head and Face, to tear my Hair and Cloaths,
to thruſt my Bed-cloaths through with naked
Swords, and piercing my Skin, and all this
for nothing, but under colour of miſtake!
Aſſure your ſelf while there is Law in the
Land, I ſhall find means to right my ſelf,
the Marchant knew not what excuſe to make

the Baliffs having proved him to be the cauſe;
and that it was his private Orders, and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Commands to uſe him whom they
found in Bed thus rigorouſly: to which the
Marchant makes no reply; but invites the
Maſter of that Houſe, and Mr. <hi>Berningham:</hi>
who by his Landlord was perſwaded, to the
<hi>Tavern,</hi> where a Chirurgion was ſent for
to dreſs thoſe hurts <hi>Berningham</hi> had received
in the Counter-ſcuffle. The Marchant makes
uſe of his intereſt in all the Company to

to which he was not willing to
liſten, till at laſt with much ado being
oblig'd to his Landlord, he conſented to an
accommodation, which was, that the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant
ſhould immediately pay him Fifty Pounds
before they parted, which he did, and was
glad to come off ſo.</p>
               <p>§ The Marchant diſcontented, goes ſtraight
home to his Houſe. Twas late at night,
and finding the door open, as he directed,
goes up to his Chamber, bemoaning his
misfortunes to his Wife, and ſhe in bed:
who joined with him in railing againſt Major
<hi>Clancie</hi> the Author of theſe diſaſters, who was
at that hour in bed with her; and while the
Merchant was venting of his Paſſion, and
ſhe ſeemingly much troubled for all thoſe
Loſſes he had mentioned; ſhe directed her
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:105373:63"/>
Friend <hi>Clancie</hi> where to convey himſelf, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Candles were brought in: which he had
the good Fortune ſeaſonably to do, in a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
private Cloſet of hers, where he remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
till morning, when the Merchants occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
timely called him. So that the Major had
opportunity to make his eſcape without diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very.
What hours of Pleaſure they two ſtole
for the future is not mentioned. But 'tis to
be ſuppoſed he ſeldom made any publick viſit.
Mr. <hi>Berningham</hi> and <hi>Clancie</hi> at their meeting
made themſelves merry, with repeating thoſe
paſſages formerly mentioned. The Marchant
reſts contented with the abſence of <hi>Clancie,</hi> for
all the loſſes he ſuſtained by him; notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
he deſpaired of ever being repaid his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
or having any other reparation.</p>

               <p>AS the Major was one day a courting of a
Miſtreſs he had in St. <hi>Martains-lane,</hi> and
looking out of the Street-window, he obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
a Fellow upon the ſtall of a Cutlers-ſhop,
and knowing him to be a Baliff, ſuſpected
his being there to wait for him, he calls
his Servant, bids him go over the way, and
bring him the Boy of that Shop that he
ſaw knocking of ſome nails: the Servant
went, and brought the Boy. Boy ſays the
Major privately, I will give you a Crown if
you will do me a ſmall piece of Service in
point of meriment, which he undertook to
do if he could: he takes the Boy to the
window and ſhows him the Fellow that ſate
upon the ſtall; do you ſee (ſays he) yonder
Fellow with a great leather Belt how it

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e may not readily free himſelf. The Boy
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:105373:64"/>
undertook it, and was very glad of the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion,
as of the reward: goes over to his
Shop, falls a knocking of ſome nails as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
of which the Fellow took no notice,
he nails the Belt, and piece of his coat to
the ſtall, as the Major directed him, who
was all the time looking out of the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow,
till he ſaw the Fellow faſt. Then
comes down to take Coach, the Fellow
ſeeing him come out, leaps off the ſtall in
great haſt, and gives it ſuch a pull that
down comes the ſtall, and all that was
upon it: tumbles the Fellow to the gronnd,
with the ſtall at his heels, and all the
Hammers, Nails, and Boxes, which at the
fall made ſuch a clutter that the Fellow
was frighted out of his wits: thinking the
Divil had been at his back: out came the
Neighbours to ſee what the matter was<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
they diſintangle the Fellow, carrie him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a houſe till he recovered his wits again<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
The Maſter of the Shop asked him if ever
he would ſit upon a ſtall again.</p>
               <p>§ The Major by his contrivance eſcaped
the Baliffs, and paſſing by <hi>Temple-bar,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expectedly
meets one of his old Creditors,
a Citizen of whom he had borrowed fifty
pounds ſome months before: the Citizen
asked him if it were not high time for him
to have his money promiſed him long ſince
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:105373:64"/>
to which the Major could make no other
anſwer then the ſcarcity of money, which
he hoped would ſoon be over; and that
then he would not ſail to pay him; and
requite his long forbearance as became an
honeſt man, that he could not chooſe but
be ſenſible, of ſuch a courteſy, and deſired
the Citizen to go with him into the Globe
Tavern hard by, and take a glaſs of Wine.
The Citizen accepted his Invitation, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
a glaſs or too deſired him to ſix upon
ſome certain time to pay this money, though
it were ſix moneths more: he did not much
ſcruple that ſo he might be ſure to receive
it at his day: to which the Major makes
anſwer he ſhould not be ſo long without
it: but that ſo ſoon as his Uncle came to
Town he doubted not of ſuch a ſupply as
would inable him to diſcharge that debt.
Being an abſolute ſtranger to the Majors
Relations, the Citizen asked him who his
Uncle was, from whom he expected that
ſupply from, he told him a man very well
known, the <hi>Biſhop of London.</hi> A very wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
reverent good Man ſays the Citizen,
upon whoſe Note or Word you ſhall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
what ſum you pleaſe or have occaſion
to uſe: thus they entertained each other
for ſome time, till the Citizen having ſome
occaſion to riſe from the Table, and walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:105373:65"/>
toward the window; obſerves the <hi>Biſhop
of London's</hi> Coach, where upon he calls to the
Major immediatly telling him his Uncle was
comming up the Street. The Major, as if
very glad of it, haſtning down the ſtairs,
takes the Citizen along, bids him keep a little
diſtance, within hearing, which the Citizen
obſerves while the Major goes to the Coach,
and bids the Coach-man hold. The Biſhop
not knowing the Major, asked what Service
he would command, or what his buſineſs
was; whereupon the Major with a great
deal of humility, told him after he had
begged his Lordſhips pardon for this unſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
trouble, occaſioned by a diſcourſe
that hapned between him and his Friend in
the Tavern about Religion, and cares of
Conſcience by which he plainly diſcovered
ſeveral doubts, and ſcruples that bred many
diſorders in this Friend; and were part of his
learning or skill to remove, which indeed
(my Lord) made me ingage to find him one,
whoſe Ability, and willingneſs was ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
known to be ready upon all ſuch oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions
(meaning your Lordſhip) the Biſhop
tells him it was well done, and I thank

Lordſhip, and look upon the work as half
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:105373:65"/>
done, now you have undertaken it, and
here is the Gentleman, calling the Citizen
to the boot of the Coach, to whom the
Biſhop gives this orders, and aſſurance in
theſe words, Sir if you pleaſe to come to
my houſe about ten of the clock to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
morning, I will ſatisfy you: the Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen
is beyond meaſure pleaſed to have ſo
much certainty of that money, he deſpaired
ever to ſee, the Major and the Citizen re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
to the Tavern, where after a glaſs
or two, he asked the Citizen how he was
pleaſed with his Uncles anſwer? ſo well
plea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ed that if you have occaſion for more
money, I am ready to furniſh you upon
that ſecurity. For I know my Lord to be
a very juſt man, the Major replies you may
be well aſſured I want money or you had
not been ſo long without yours, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
the Citizen lends him fifty broad
pieces of Gold, in hopes to have it repaid
by the Biſhop the next day, with the other
fifty at the hour appointed.</p>
               <p>§ The Citizen riſes betimes joyfully, goes
to the Biſhops houſe about the hour of ten,
as he was directed, and meeting one of
the Biſhops Servants, deſires him to acquaint
my Lord there was a man to ſpeak with
his Lordſhip by his own appointment, the
Servant went and told my Lord as much,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:105373:66"/>
my Lord having it ſeems forgot; asked what
manner of man it was, till by mentioning
the appointment, and recollecting upou the
diſcourſe he had with a Geutleman he knew
who was in the Street the day before: calls
to minde the promiſe he had made to ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy
the Gentleman in his doubtful ſcruples
of Conſcience, and believing that to be
the Gentleman, bids his Servant take him
into the dining-room, and there to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
him with a glaſs of Sack, while he
ſtaid in his Cloſet to look over ſome few
caſes and prepare himſelf for the diſcourſe
he expected, his ſtay was not long, when
coming into the Dining-room he deſires the
Gentleman to ſit down by him, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d very
freely to ſpeak his mind and conceal no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
that troubled him, which the Citizen
did after doing his Duty, and giving his
thanks to the Biſhop, then falls a telling
a long ſtory how that he had lent his Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew
fifty pounds ſome moneths ſince, and
Yeſterday fifty pounds more in Gold, upon
his Lords promiſe to ſatisfy that debt by
the hour of ten of the clock, which he
comes now to receive, the Biſhop lookt
upon him very ſtrangely, admiring what he
meant by talking to him of a Nephew, and
fifty pound long ſince, and fifty more Ye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterday,
and gave him the hearing with the
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:105373:66"/>
more patience, thinking it to be the effects of
a light Head, that having wanted ſleep oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned
by what had been told him. The
Citizen wondred what the matter was that
the Biſhop was ſo ſlow in paying the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
he thought himſelf ſo ſure of, preſſes
more earneſtly for it; ſo that the Biſhop
found the man was really in earneſt; and
therefore makes him this anſwer. Sir I am
a ſtranger to you, as alſo to all you have
ſaid. I know nothing of the matter of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
or Nephew you ſpeak of, for I have
none, nor do I well underſtand you, as
for the promiſe I made Yeſterday, for which
you now challenge me, 'twas net for pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of any money, but to endeavour your
ſatisfaction another way, by removing thoſe
doubts of Conſcience in points of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
with which you had been ſo tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
that was my promiſe, and my mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and that I am ſtill ready to perform,
and nothing elſe. The Citizen hearing this
Reſolution, grew ſo ſtark mad to think
how he was deluded: and how unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natly
he contributed to his own undoing,
by parting with his laſt fifty pounds; could
not contain himſelf from telling the Biſhop
his reſentments; to which the Biſhop makes
this reply that he believed his diſcourſe to
be a contrivance between the other man
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:105373:67"/>
and him to cheat him of his money, but
they ſhould find their miſtake. Pardon me
for that, (ſays the Citizen) being very much
troubled, and in great rage; for my Lord
it looks more like ſuch a deſign between
your Nephew, and you, then for me to cheat
my ſelf: this made the Biſhop ſo angry that
he bid the Fellow go about his buſineſs, ſo
left the Room. the Citizen is ready to hang
himſelf, knows not in the World what
courſe to take, till upon ſome Advice he
ſets forth the whole caſe by way of Petition
to the King, to whom it was preſented by
the hands of Sir <hi>Edward Nicolls</hi> then Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary.</p>
               <p>§ The King having read the Petition, and
finding it to have ſo great a reſemblance
to the many ſuch like effects oft times told
of Major <hi>Clancie:</hi> ſays, if Major <hi>Clancie</hi>
were alive, I ſhould think this to be one
of his Pranks, a Gentleman of the Court
ſtanding by, ſays Sir I am ſure he is alive,
for I ſaw him in the Gallery as I came hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
now, the King bid him call in <hi>Clancie,</hi>
which the Gentleman did, as ſoon as he
appeared, the King bid him look upon that
Petition, and tell if it were not like one
of his roguiſh Tricks: to which <hi>Clancie</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudently
anſwered (may it pleaſe your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty)
I know this ſtory well, for 'twas I
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:105373:67"/>
that did it: ſo runs haſtily out of the Room,
the King not being willing to have the reſt
buried, commands the Secretary to write a
<hi>Refference,</hi> upon the Citizens Petition to my
<hi>Lord of Ormond,</hi> to examine and report, if not
determine the matter: as ſoon as the Piti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and refference was brought to my
Lord: he appoints a day of hearing, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to which he ſent for the Biſhop, like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
to the Citizen, who failed not of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
at the hour to the place appointed for
the hearing. Thither came a croud of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
to hear the matter debated, firſt the
Citizen was called to make good the <hi>Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations</hi>
of the Petition, which he did, with
much eaſe, there being none to contradict.</p>
               <p>§ Then the Biſhop was deſired to make
his defence, who confeſſed theſe words in
the Petition to be true, that is that he would
ſatisfy the Petitioner next day in his doubts,
and ſcruples of Conſcience, but not to pay
any money, for there was not a word of any
ſuch like thing ſpoken of by any of them,
which was all he had to ſay. My <hi>Lord of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi>
asked if there were any Witneſs, or
other proof to be heard on either ſide? to
which he anſwered no.</p>
               <p>Why then ſays my Lord I do find upon
the whole matter, that the Petitioner is out
of purſe two ſeveral fifty pounds, one was
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:105373:68"/>
lent long before your Lordſhip was any way
concerned, ſo as I muſt needs free you from
any part of that ſum, as for the laſt fifty
which was abſolutely lent upon your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips
promiſe of ſatisfaction by ſuch an
hour. I do not clearly find how to eaſe
you of that; but adviſe you to compound
with the Petitioner, ſeveral arguments were
uſed by the Biſhop to ſtrengthen what had
been Pleaded in his behalf, and formerly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated
in this diſcourſe: but all to little
purpoſe.</p>

               <p>AT the <hi>Kings</hi> Reſtauration, <hi>The Prince of

at which they were very much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyced,
<hi>Gerardo</hi> began to talk of my <hi>Lord

ſo ſoon after ſo many Changes and Revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions.
<hi>Gerardo</hi> asked his Maſter if he

conſented, and ſaid, he would write by him
to my <hi>Lord of Ormond,</hi> a Letter of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratulation,
with ſome modeſt mention of
his own ſmall Concern: His preparation for
his Journy took up but little time, nor do

<hi>England,</hi> where he ſpent part of his time
in ſeeing the Country; informing himſelf
every where as he Travelled of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
Satisfaction, in the Kings coming home,
very inquiſitive after the Nobility, of their
ſeveral Names and Fortunes, eſpecially my
<hi>Lord of Ormond,</hi> of whom he had ſuch Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters
of nobleneſs, and a ccompliſhed
generoſity as confirmed him in the belief
of what he had often heard before. To
Court he comes, there enquires for my
<hi>Lord of Ormonds</hi> Apartment: where meeting
ſome of my Lords Gentlemen, deſired to
be brought to kiſs my Lords hand, and
deliver his Letter, of which my Lord ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
notice, ſent to have the Gentleman
brought up, who no ſooner came into the
Room, and delivered his Letter: but there
was obſerved a ſuddain change in his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance:
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:105373:69"/>
at which the Standers by much
wondered; although not half ſo much as
my Lord did at the Letter, which menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
thing which my Lord knew nothing
of; but having read it, turns to the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman
that brought it him, and ſaid, Sir, I
underſtand by this Letter you have brought
me from the Prince, that your Name is
<hi>Gerardo,</hi> and that you are his Servant; and
that you brought me at ſuch a time from
him a very kind and friendly Token. Pray
Sir did you bring any ſuch, or did you ever
ſee me before this time? The Gentleman ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
how groſely he was miſtaken in him,
that took upon him to be Lord of <hi>Ormond,</hi>
the greatneſs of the difference, both in
Perſon and Carriage; ſcarce knew what
Anſwer, or what excuſe to make for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
either to my Lord or his Maſter were
he there preſent; and had enough to do to
ſtand upon his Legs; which all perceived,
yet with a great Sigh, he told my Lord,
how innocently he fell into a moſt unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate
miſtake, though with a true inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of a real Service to his Lordſhip, that
moſt true it is, that I never ſaw your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
till now, and as true as there was a
Gentleman, that came into our Country,
that did perſonate your Lordſhip very cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly,
and imploy'd me to the Prince;
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:105373:69"/>
who very readily ſent by me what he deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
believing him to be my <hi>Lord of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond;</hi>
though not reſembling you in the
leaſt; this my Lord is the truth, and my
undoing to be inſtrumental in a thing of that
prejudice to my Maſter, and no manner of
Service to your Lordſhip, to whom it was
intended.</p>
               <p>§ To which my Lord makes this reply,
that he never knew any thing of the matter
before, yet is very ſenſible of the Princes
kind intentions, and that although he did
not receive the benefit of the kindneſs inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
him; yet his obligation was no whit the
leſs, and that he would not alow the Prince
to be a Sufferer for his good will to him;
but would reſtore him his money with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thanks, which he commanded-ſhould be
immediately brought to <hi>Gerardo,</hi> with a To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
of Gratitude for his own good will.
The caſe is much altered with <hi>Gerardo</hi> upon
the ſuddain, who reſolves for the remaining

he had no money about him, but ſend one

know the Boy will be very ſhie, and ſeem
not to underſtand your meaning; But let
not that ſuffice till you have a full view of

careful. The Barbour promiſes to be mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
of it, and ſo ſoon as the Major went
into the Coach, bid the Boy go along with
the Barbour, and he would do his buſineſs: the
Boy makes a leg, and goes along.</p>
               <p>§ The Barbour leads him into a private

thought the Fellow mad, and bluſhed to

The Boy vowed and ſwore he had no Pox,
that his Maſter lived in Cheapſide, and ſent
him with that Gentleman for his money. All
this would not ſerve the Barbours turn, but
he muſt be true to his truſt, and will ſearch,
ſo that the diſpute ended in Cuffs; but in
the end the Barbour being too hard for the
Boy, forced down his Breeches, and ſearcht
the Boy, who he found as clear, and ſound
as any Creature could be. The Barbour
ſatisfied himſelf that he had done his part.
The poor Boy much troubled for his abuſe,
without remedy goes home to his Maſter,
with this ſad account. Tells him the whole
ſtory, how that inſtead of money he had a
beating, and a long Encounter with the Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
and was ſearched for the Pox; the
Maſter not knowing how to help himſelf,
could not chooſe but ſmile at the paſſage,
who muſt ſit down with the loſs.</p>

               <p>THe Major having played ſo many miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous
Pranks, by Cheating and Abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
ſo many Perſons of all ſorts, without
diſtinction, thinks it high time for to leave
<hi>England,</hi> and propoſes to himſelf ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of more ſafety in <hi>Ireland,</hi> where he
had not been in a long time, though not
been Idle when he was there. Thither he
goes, where by ſome he is made welcome,
more for the deſcription he ſometimes gave
of the paſſages of his Life, wherein People
found ſome paſtime, then any way coveting
his ſo well known Company. At the time
of his being in <hi>Ireland,</hi> there was erected
a Court for Trial of all Mens Qualifications,
called the Court of Clames, which he ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
often frequented, and obſerved the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of proceedings there, and how Juſtice
was deſtributed to all Men according to
Evidence; he being given to underſtand
that in that Court was a day perfixed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to Rule, for the Trial of one in
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:105373:71"/>
                  <hi>Makoones</hi> Qualification, where he muſt ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
prove his Innocency or be declar'd
Nocent, and conſequently looſe his Eſtate.
He that was chiefly concerned in this Cauſe,
and who muſt have found Witneſſes for to
Criminate <hi>Maccmahon</hi> was, Sir <hi>Henry In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glesby,</hi>
a Perſon of much Worth and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
to whom Major <hi>Clancie</hi> offers his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice;
as being the fitteſt Man in the World
for Sir <hi>Henry</hi> to imploy as he pretended:
and gave theſe reaſons, that <hi>Maccmahon</hi> was
well known to him; ſo were moſt of his
Actions of his Life. Eſpecially from the
firſt of all the Rebellion wherein he preſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
Sir <hi>Henry</hi> was only concerned: here he
tells him that there was ſuch a Cauſe, ſuch
a day to be heard; and that he doubted not
of Proof ſufficient to Criminate <hi>Maccmahon,</hi>
nor would he be ungrateful to ſuch as would
appear there for him. Sir ſays the Major,
the Service I can do is this; I can prove by
ſeveral Witneſſes, that <hi>Mac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>mahon</hi> in the
firſt of the Rebellion was in Actual Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
with the Rebels; that he had command
of a Troop of Horſe, and that there were
comming from their own dwellings to be
ſheltered from the Rebels in <hi>Cork,</hi> twelve
poor Engliſh-men that were killed by this
<hi>Maccmahon</hi> in ſuch a place, this alone I
can aſſure (ſays <hi>Clancie</hi>) is ſufficient to do

your work; and ſhall be proved before the
Judges of the Court, by ſuch Witneſſes as
I ſhall not fail to bring, on which you with
confidence rely. Sir <hi>Henry</hi> was undoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
pleaſed to have the offer of ſuch a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
ſo ſeaſonable; gave the Major many
thanks, with the aſſurance of ſuch a return
as became him for ſo great a kindneſs.</p>
               <p>§ The day appointed for this cauſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
come, Major <hi>Clancie</hi> having prepared his
Witneſſes, waits upon Sir <hi>Henry</hi> to the Court
where Sir <hi>Henry</hi> was called, and asked if he
was ready, and where were his Witneſſes.
He produced ſeven, brought him by Major
<hi>Clancie:</hi> whoſe Teſtimony agreed ſo well
in every Circumſtance that the Court was
ſatisfyed, and reſolved to declare <hi>Maccma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hon</hi>
Nocent; till Sir <hi>Henry</hi> offers to the
Court that in caſe they are not yet ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
ſatisfied with what they have heard
of his proof, he had one more ſufficient good
Witneſs to confirm what had been proved
before; to which the Court anſwered they
would diſcountenance none; but hear as
many as he pleaſed, whereupon Major <hi>Clan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie</hi>
was called: having given him his Oath,
the Court asked him if he knew <hi>Maccma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hon,</hi>
and how long? he anſwered he knew
<hi>Maccmahon</hi> from his infancy. 'Twas asked
him again how he found <hi>Maccmahon</hi> incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
as to the Rebellion, and laſtly what he
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:105373:74"/>
knew as to the cauſe depending? To all
which he makes anſwer thus: may it pleaſe
his Honour and Court to take notice: that
I am upon my Oath, and ſhall ſpeak nothing
but the truth: that I know <hi>Maccmahon</hi> the Son
and Heir of Sir <hi>Tirlah Maccmahon,</hi> and from
his Infancy had an intimate acquaintance
with him, and that in all that time I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
knew an honeſter a true Man to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſed
Engliſh, and farther by the vertue of
the Oath I have taken, I do believe he never
drew Sword in anger, or ever drew drop of
Blood in all his life. I do farther take upon
my Oath that I believe theſe ſeven men that
ſwore laſt before me, knew no more ill of
him then I do: that the Teſtimonies they
gave here againſt him is only the dictates
they had from me: how ſays the Judge! here
is a great contradiction, that have point-blank
Criminated him, knew no ill of him:
but what you have dictated, and you ſware
him innocent to all intents. How can this
agree or be made out? To which Major <hi>Clan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie</hi>
replies, 'tis all very true; and I will make
it out with the Reaſons I had for doing of it.
I have been often at Trials of the like na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
in this Court, where I have ſeen, and
obſerved to my great trouble of mind, many
and innocent Perſons ſuffer to their undoing,
by their Perjury of ſuborned Witneſſes: and
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:105373:75"/>
being very fearful that ſuch of the like might
have been here. to the ruin and utter de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction
of ſo much innocency: to prevent
which, I chooſe rather to bring my ſelf
upon the Stage by offering my ſelf to Sir
<hi>Henry.</hi> By which I hope I have preſerved
the Fortune of an honeſt Innocent Man. And
for farther Proof of this undeniable Proof,
I humbly deſire that ſome of the ſeven, ſworn
and examined before me may be again exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
if what I have here declared, be not all
true, to the knowledge of every one of them,
which requeſt was granted. The Fellows were
reexamined, who confeſſed this to be true<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Whereupon the Cat was turned into the Pan.
Mr. <hi>Maccmahon</hi> was declared innocent, his
Eſtate decreed him, and Sir <hi>Henry</hi> put to ſhiſt
for deficiences elſe-where.</p>

               <p>MAjor <hi>Clancie</hi> now begins to find how
that by his long continued lew'd
Practices he has brought himſelf to that
paſs, that few or none will anear him.
Such as do, are in a continual apprehenſion
of ſome deſign, which makes moſt Men
keep at ſuch a diſtance: that <hi>Clancie</hi> is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitated
to quit the Kingdom, which he
ſcarce knows how to do for want of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney.
Till ſupplied by a Friend that had
for ſome time kept him concealed from his
Perſecutors in a Cloſet: till there was an
opportunity to convoy him aboard a Ship
that was Bound for <hi>Cheſter,</hi> and was Wind-driven
into <hi>Beumoris</hi> in <hi>Wales.</hi> The Major
takes up his Lodging at the <hi>Poſt-Maſters
Houſe,</hi> one Mr. <hi>Jones,</hi> where he had not
been above an hour, when there chances
to Arrive a <hi>Lady</hi> that came from <hi>London,</hi>
and was bound for <hi>Ireland.</hi> which the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor
underſtanding by one of her Servants,
deſired the Servant to acquaint his Lady
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:105373:76"/>
that there was a conveniency very lucky
come into the Harbour, which undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly
She would be glad to make uſe of,
which was the Ship which the Major came
out of <hi>Ireland</hi> in. A ſtrong ſtanſh <hi>Veſſel,</hi>
with good Accomodations, and very skilful
<hi>Seamen.</hi> The Servant very joyfully goes to
his Lady, and acquaints her with all that
the Gentleman had told him, whereupon
the Lady being deſirous to be rid of a te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious
troubleſome Journy, was extreamly
glad to hear of ſuch a conveniency, were
it but to ſave her the labour of going to
<hi>Holly-head:</hi> which muſt have coſt her the Toil
of another day.</p>
               <p>§ Whereupon She ſent her Servant to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
that Gentleman to come to her Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
if it were not troubleſome to him af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
his Voiage; of whom She expected a
more exact account of particulars, in order
to her Tranſportation; which the Servant
neglected not, but went forthwith to the
Major and delivered his Meſſage. You may
eaſily believe the Major would looſe no
time to obey the commands of a Fair
Lady; (as he found her to be) who no
ſooner comes into the Room, after a kind
ſalute; but the Lady deſires to know more
of thoſe conveniences, being altogether a
ſtranger to the matters of that kind, or any
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:105373:76"/>
things that belonged to <hi>Sea Affairs:</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
her occaſions compell'd her to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
it at this time invoidably. The Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor
told her that there was no conveniency
to be expected in any Ship upon the <hi>Iriſh
Seas,</hi> but this Ship had, which he was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly
glad of for her ſake; as alſo that
he had the good Fortune to be Meſſenger
of ſo good News to her. Some time was
ſpent in diſcourſe till they were called to
Supper, where the Major very diligently
attended each motion, or look of Hers,
and that in ſuch a way as muſt have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed
a paſſion, which is impoſſible but
She muſt take notice of, and improbability
not much diſſatisfied therewith.</p>
               <p>§ Thus they continued ſome days, the
Wind being ſtill croſs, till at laſt he plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
told her, he had not the power any
longer to conceal his affections, which he
had ſo long ſmother'd to his unſpeakable
prejudice, and diſquiet. She with a great
deal of modeſty, told him how ſorry ſhe
ſhould be to occaſion the prejudice or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet
of any body: and that She believed
all this to be but words of courſe: and
that the Major did it for his paſtime, She
being very ſenſible there could be no ſuch
Attractiveneſs of her part, that could pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
any ſuch effect: to which the Major
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:105373:77"/>
makes this reply, that if She doubted the
Truth of what he had ſaid, he ſhould evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
it to the hazard of his life, and
turn back from his intended <hi>Journy to Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi>
without regard, or conſideration of
any thing, and wait of her into <hi>Ireland,</hi>
with reſolution never to quit his preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
or decline her Service. Thus the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor
laies cloſe Seige to the Lady having
two Friends to joyn with him in his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking,
<hi>Opportunity,</hi> and <hi>Importunity,</hi> who
have all plaid their parts ſo ſuccesfully,
that the tender hearted Lady was at laſt
forced to yeild. But upon the moſt honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Terms of <hi>Marriage,</hi> which was ſoon
conſummated to the unſpeakable comfort,
and conſolation of both. This Seige held
a great while, about ſix days, to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
of many Bottles; at the charge of
the Major, whoſe whole ſtudy is how to
reemburſe himſelf by the help of his Lady,
whoſe little ſtock of money, with a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable
percel of Jewels, are moſt wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
delivered as a Marriage Portion to
the Major.</p>
               <p>§ Whoſe Brains are now as buſie in
contriving a way to leave his poor betray'd
Lady, as ever they were in giving Her
good will to this <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nfortunate Match.</hi> Too
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:105373:77"/>
late to be repented, he wrote a Letter
as if brought him by a Meſſenger of the
<hi>Earl of Carbury;</hi> from his houſe the <hi>Golden
Grove,</hi> ſignifying how much it concern'd
the Major, to make all the haſte he could
thither for prevention of his own harm,
which unavoidably muſt follow if he come
not quickly away. This Letter he order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to be brought him when they were all
ſate at Table, which he reads with ſome
<hi>Surprize,</hi> as if a ſtranger to the occaſion,
and the preſſure of it; then delivers it to
his Lady, who upon reading of it had
like to have fallen down dead, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of the ſuddainneſs of it: and her own
apprehenſions for the loſs of her Joy.
(though but for a time) The Maſter of
the Houſe and the reſt of the Company
applied things to recover her. As ſoon as
Dinner was done, he takes his Lady aſide,
and gives her all the aſſurance imaginable,
as well of his Conſtancy, as his ſpeedy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn;
in the interim leaves her box in
which her Jewels formerly lay; makes her
believe he had removed none, when in
truth he had left none: he takes his leave
of all, and goes toward <hi>Aperconeway.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. His Lady fixing her Blubbered Eyes
upon him, till he was out of ſight, then
goes to her Chamber, bemoaning her ſelf
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:105373:78"/>
to the Walls (who undoubtedly would have
pittied her, if they had Sence) this poor
diſtreſſed <hi>Lady</hi> a term proper to all that
have to do with him) knows not what is
beſt to do, either to go for <hi>Ireland,</hi> or ſtay
where ſhe is, and there wait the coming of
her Comfort; which for a long time ſhe
did in vain; for he never came thither af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
but left her to pay all his Debts, as
well as her own; which gave her occaſion
to go to her Box, with intention to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
of one of the <hi>Jewels</hi> of leſſer Value;
But when ſhe had opened the Box,
and found none there; then came her Fits
in earneſt: by which ſhe was made the true
Object of Pitty, having neither money nor
Jewels left; and what was worſt of all,
betrayed by the falſe heartedneſs of a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
Lover, who has now left her no
other Relief, than what the Charity of
good People will allow her. In this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſed

               <p>THe Major being in few days arrived

Debauching the <hi>Maid-Servant;</hi> who would
by no means conſent, without a promiſe
of <hi>Marriage,</hi> which he never ſcrupled, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
ſome other Deſign in which he intended
to make uſe of her; he had not often been in
Company, but ſome one or other revives
a Diſcourſe of his former Actions, by
which he perceives that moſt Men begin to
forſake him, being in a low Condition;
having ſquandred away his late acquired
Jewels: it being his conſtant Cuſtome as
ſoon as he had a Stock to Laviſh it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travigantly
upon all Occaſions without
regard to the time to come, or preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his Credit deſigning nothing but
to Cheat; which rendered him uncapable
of admittance into civil Company; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:105373:79"/>
he was neceſſitated to play at <hi>Small
Games.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. As appeared upon making his Addreſs
to a very ordinary plain woman, neither
Rich nor Fair, to whom he had promiſed
Marriage, and thereby Invites her to go
with him into a little blind Alehouſe,
where they lived like Man and Wife for
three or four days. One Morning as they
lay in Bed, he tells her how inconvenient
this place is for them to reſide in; and
therefore would have her take ſome courſe
to diſcharge what expence they had been
at ſince their comming, for he declared he
had it not. Shee plainly Anſwered, ſhe
had nothing in the World but that Ring,
which ſhe pulled off, of her Finger, and
gave him; a very rich Couple fortunately
put together, able enough to undo any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
two they met with. He no ſooner fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
the Ring, but conveys himſelf away
and leaves his Wife to pay the Reckoning,
which ſhe was forced to pawn her Clothes
for; and being Jealous of his going to viſit
others he loved better, She with <hi>Hew and
Cry</hi> apprehended him, had him ſent to
<hi>Newgate,</hi> where he had but few Viſiters ſave
only the <hi>Servant-Maid</hi> with whom he had
contracted a Friendſhip, when he Lodged
at the Barbers in <hi>Kingſtreet;</hi> who by this
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:105373:79"/>
time had removed from the Barbers
to the Service of one Mr. <hi>Owen,</hi> from
whence ſhe often went to <hi>Newgate</hi> in
pure kindneſs to Major <hi>Clancie,</hi> and in
moſt of her Viſits thither, ſhe carried
in her Arms a Child of her Miſtreſſes
who ſeldome came home without Cree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
at its Back, to witneſs the clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of the place it came from. One
day this Maid-Servant Viſiting the
Major, he tells her how Unfortunate
he is, in the want of a ſmall ſum of
thirty pounds, for which he could now
redeem himſelf from the great danger
that threatned him, and free himſelf of
his Reſtraint, and reſtore his Liberty,
which he preferred before the World.
She being undoubtedly much concerned,
told him where there lay a conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
ſum of mony much above that ſum
as ſhe gueſt by the Bulk. If there
could be away contrived to bring it
him, ſhe would not fail of her part,
at which the Major overjoy'd, told her
though he was a Priſoner, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
deprived of power to do it in
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:105373:80"/>
his own perſon, that he had thoſe he durſt

                  </gap>ly
with her Aſſiſtance; ſo that before they
parted it was reſolved, that thoſe he ſent
ſhould come at ſuch an hour to Mr.
<hi>Owens</hi> houſe to be merry, with reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to find fault with any Room they
ſhould be carried into, till the Maid
had given them a Sign, by which they
were to know the Room wherein the
money lay. All which was effected in
very few days, with great ſucceſs, in
ſo much, that the two Men imployed
by the Major, had in their poſſeſſion
one hundred Broad pieces of Gold,
and thirty pounds in Silver; which they
carried clearly away, and conſidering
how rich they were grown upon the
ſuddain, bethink them how to make
this money their own by dividing it
between them two, without thought
of him that imployed them; ſo that
they Robbed Mr. <hi>Owen,</hi> and Cheated
Major <hi>Clancie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>No ſooner came Mr. <hi>Owen</hi> to the

induſtrious Dilligence makes ſuch inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,

which upon Examination before a

                  </gap>dge, ſhe could hardly deny; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
ſhe was committed, and would
have been hanged, but that ſhe preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to be with Child. Nor did Mr.
<hi>Owen</hi> reſt ſatisfied with this, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves
to ſpare neither Charge nor La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
to find them out that Robb'd him,
which he did in few days, and had
them Committed to <hi>Newgate,</hi> till the
<hi>Great destructive Conflagration</hi> came ſo
near, that ſtruck ſuch a Terror in all
the Inhabitants, that they ſcarce knew
what they did. One day the Jailor
or Turnkey coming to viſit his Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
amongſt the reſt theſe two that
had Robb'd Mr. <hi>Owen,</hi> who plainly told
him how that they apprehended the
danger of the Fire much more than the
Crime for which they were committed;
Vowing that it he would not take off their
their Irons, and ſet them free from that
Danger, he ſhould never leave that Place,
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:105373:81"/>
but that they would force him to ſtay and
take his ſhare of what hapned; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon,
the affrighted Fellow, ſtrikes off
their Irons, ſets them at Liberty, and
goes away; who were no ſooner in the
Streets than they fell to Pluudering all
ſuch Goods as they met with, or could
conveniently carry away. Thus Mr.
<hi>Owen</hi> was Robbed without Relief, the
Robbers and the Maid ſaved, but Major
