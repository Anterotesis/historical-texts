         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

You may ſee that Englands freedome, which

the unrighteous proceedings of Kingſtone-Court againſt ſome
of the Diggers at <hi>George</hi>-hill, under colour of Law; but yet thereby
the cauſe of the Diggers is more brightened and ſtrengthened:

deſired.</head>
            <p>THou City of London, I am one of thy ſons by freedome, and I do truly
love thy peace; while I had an eſtate in thee, I was free to offer my Mite
into thy publike Treaſury Guild-hall, for a preſervation to thee, and the
whole Land; but by thy cheating ſons in the theeving art of buying and ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
and by the burdens of, and for the Souldiery in the beginning of the war,
I was beaten out both of eſtate and trade, and forced to accept of the good
will of friends crediting of me, to live a Countrey-life, and there likewiſe
by the burthen of Taxes and much Free-quarter, my weak back found the
burthen heavier then I could bear; yet in all the paſſages of theſe eight yeers
troubles I have been willing to lay out what my Talent was, to procure En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glands
peace inward and outward, and yet all along I have found ſuch as in
words have profeſſed the ſame cauſe, to be enemies to me. Not a full yeere
ſince, being quiet at my work, my heart was filled with ſweet thoughts, and
many things were revealed to me which I never read in books, nor heard
from the mouth of any fleſh, and when I began to ſpeak of them, ſome peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
could not bear my words, and amongſt thoſe revelations this was one,
<hi>That the earth ſhall be made a common Treaſury of livelihood to whole mankind,
without respect of perſons;</hi> and I had a voice within me bad me declare it all
abroad, which I did obey, for I declared it by word of mouth whereſoever I
came, then I was made to write a little book called, <hi>The new Law of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,</hi>
and there in I declared it; yet my mind was not at reſt, becauſe nothing
was acted, and thoughts run in me, that words and writings were all no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
and muſt die, for action is the life of all, and if thou doſt not act, thou
doſt nothing. Within a little time I was made obedient to the word in that
particular likewiſe; for I tooke my ſpade and went and broke the ground
upon <hi>George-hill</hi> in Surrey, thereby declaring freedome to the Creation, and
that the earth muſt be ſet free from intanglements of Lords and Landlords,
and that it ſhall become a common Treaſury to all, as it was firſt made and
given to the ſonnes of men: For which doing the Dragon preſently caſts a
flood of water to drown the manchild, even that freedom that now is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared,

for a treſpaſſe in digging upon George-hill in Surrey,
being the rights of Mr. <hi>Drake</hi> the Lord of that Mannour, as they ſay,
we all three did appear the firſt Court day of our arreſt, and deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
of the Court, what was laid to onr Charge, and to give anſwer
thereunto our ſelves: But the anſwer of your Conrt was this, that you
would not tell us what the Treſpaſſe was, unleſſe we would fee an At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torney
to ſpeak for us; we told them we were to plead our own
cauſe, for we knew no Lawyer that we could truſt with this buſineſſe:
we deſired a copie of the Declaration, and profered to pay for it;
and ſtill you denied us, unleſſe we would fee an Attorney. But in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion,
the Recorder of your Court told us, the cauſe was not entred;
we appeared two Court daies after this, and deſired to ſee the Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
and ſtill you denied us, unleſſe we will fee an Attorney; ſo gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy

Lawes, when they are to be caſt out of equity, and reaſon be the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derator.</p>
            <p>Then ſeeing you would not ſuffer us to ſpeak, one of us brought
this following writing into your Court, that you might read our an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer;
becauſe we would acknowledge all righteous proceedings in
Law, though ſome ſlander us, and ſay we deny all Law, becauſe we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
the corruption in Law, and endeavour a Reformation in our place
and calling, according to that Nationall Covenant: and we know if
your Lawes be built upon equity and reaſon, you ought both to have
heard us ſpeak, and read our anſwer; for that is no righteous Law,
whereby to keep a Common-wealth in peace, when one ſort ſhall be
ſuffered to ſpeak, and not another, as you deal with us, to paſſe ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence

told us we muſt fee an Attorney to ſpeak for us, or els you would mark
us for default in not appearance. This is contrary to your own Laws
likewiſe, for in 28. <hi>Ed.</hi> 1. 11. chap. there is freedome given to a man
to ſpeak for himſelf, or els he may chooſe his father, friend or neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor
to plead for him, without the help of any other Lawyer.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:117589:4"/>
Fourthly, you have granted a judgement againſt us, and are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
to an execution, and this is contrary likewiſe to your own
Laws, which ſay, that no plaint ought to be received, or judgement
paſſed, till the cauſe be heard, and witneſſes preſent, to teſtifie the
plaint to be true, as Sir <hi>Edward Cook</hi> 2. <hi>part of Inſtitutes</hi> upon the 29.
chap. of <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> fol. 51. 52. 53. The <hi>Mirror of Juſtice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But that all men may ſee, we are neither aſhamed nor afraid, to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie
that cauſe we are arreſted for, neither to refuſe to anſwer to it in
a righteous way, therefore we have here delivered this up in writing,
and we leave it in your hands, diſavowing the proceedings of your
Court, becauſe you uphold Prerogative oppreſſion, though the Kingly
office be taken away, and the Parliament hath declared England a
Common-Wealth; ſo that Prerogative Laws cannot be in force, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
you be beſotted by your covetouſneſſe and envy.</p>
            <p>We deny that vve have treſpaſſed againſt thoſe three men, or
Mr. <hi>Drake</hi> either, or that vve ſhould treſpaſſe againſt any, if vve ſhould
dig up, or plovv for a livelihood, upon any the vvaſt Land in England,
for thereby we break no particular Law made by any Act of Parliament,
but only an ancient cuſtome, bred in the ſtrength of Kingly Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,
vvhich is that old Lavv or cuſtome, by vvhich Lords of Mannours
lay claime to the Commons, vvhich is of no force novv to bind the
people of England, ſince the Kingly povver and office vvas caſt out:
and the common people, who have caſt out the oppreſſor, by their
purſe and perſon, have not authorized any as yet, to give away from
them their purchaſed freedome; and if any aſſume a power to give a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,
or withhold this purchaſed freedome, they are Traytors to this
Common-Wealth of England and if they impriſon, oppreſſe, or put
to death any for ſtanding to maintaine the purchaſed freedome, they
are murderers and thieves, and no juſt rulers.</p>
            <p>Therefore in the light of reaſon and equity, and in the light of the
Nationall Covenant, which Parliament and people have taken, with
joynt conſent: all ſuch Prerogative cuſtomes, which by experience we
have found to burden the Nation, ought to be caſt out, with the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
office, and the Land of England now ought to be a free Land, and a
common treaſury to all her children, otherwiſe it cannot properly be
called a Common-Wealth.</p>
            <p>Therefore we juſtifie our act of digging upon that hill, to make the
earth a common treaſurie. Firſt, becauſe the earth was made by Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
God, to be a common treaſury of livelihood for vvhole mankind
in all his branches, without reſpect of perſons; and that not any one
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:117589:5"/>
according to the Word of God (vvhich is love) the pure Law of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe,
ought to be Lord or landlord over another, but whole man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
was made equall, and knit into one body by one ſpirit of love,
which is Chriſt in you the hope of glory, even all the members of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

            <p>But ſince the fall of man there from, which came in by the riſin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>
of covetouſneſſe in the heart of mankind (to which Serpent the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>
conſented) and from thence mankind was called <hi>Adam:</hi> for this co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſſe
makes mankind to be a ſtoppage of freedome in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">

               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and by this covetous power, one branch of mankind began to lift
up himſelf above another, as <hi>Cain</hi> lifted up himſelf, and killed his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Abel:</hi> and ſo one branch did kill and ſteal away the comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
uſe of the earth from another, as it is now: the elder brother lives in
a continuall thee very, ſtealing the Land from the younger-brother. And
the plain truth is, theeves and murderers upheld by preaching witches
and deceivers, rule the Nations: and for the preſent, the Laws and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of the world, are Laws of darkneſſe, and the divells King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
for covetouſneſſe rules all. And the power of the ſword over
brethren in Armies, in Arreſts, in Priſons, in gallows, and in other infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour
torments, inflicted by ſome upon others, as the oppreſſion of
Lords of Mannours, hindring the poore from the uſe of the common
Land, is <hi>Adam</hi> fallen, or <hi>Cain</hi> killing <hi>Abel</hi> to this very day.</p>
            <p>And theſe Prerogative oppreſſors, are the Adamites &amp; Cainites that
walk contrary to the Word of God (which is love) by upholding
murder and theft, by Laws which their Fathers made, and which they
novv juſtifie; for in the conqueſts that. Kings got, their Anceſtors did
murder and kill, and ſteal away the earth, and removed the Land mark
from the conquered, and made Lavvs to impriſon, torment, or put to
death, all that vvould adventure to take the Land from them againe,
and left both that ſtoln Land, and murdering Lavvs to their children,
the Lords of Mannours, and Freeholders, vvho novv vvith violence, do
juſtifie their Fathers vvickedneſſe, by holding faſt, that vvhich vvas left
them by ſucceſſion.</p>
            <p>For vvhat are all the Lavvs of the Nations, in this corrupt covetous
Government, lifting up one branch of <hi>Adam</hi> mankind above another,
the Conqueror, above the conquered, or thoſe that have povver a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
them that are vveak, I ſay vvhat are they, but Lavvs of murder
and theft, yea enmity it ſelf, againſt the Lavv of righteouſneſſe, vvhich
is love, vvhich makes people do, as they vvould be done unto?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:117589:5"/>
And ſo all Kingly power, (in one or many mens hands) raigning by the
ſword, giving the uſe of the earth to ſome of mankind (called by him his
Gentry) and denying the free uſe of the Earth to others, called the younger
brothers, or common people, is no other but <hi>Cain</hi> li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ted up above <hi>Abel;</hi>
the Prerogative Lavves is <hi>Belzebub,</hi> for they are the ſtrength of covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
and bondage in the creation, lifting up one, and caſting dovvn ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
the Atturneys, and Prieſts, and Lawyers, and Bayliffs are ſervants
to <hi>Belzebub,</hi> and are Devils; their Priſons, Whips, and Gallows are the

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>or mind it all along,
and you ſhall ſee, that covetouſneſſe and bitter envie gets freedome by
theſe Lavves; But the ſincere and meek in ſpirit, is trod under foot.</p>
            <p>And this is that povver, that hath made ſuch havock in the Creation,
it is that murderer and Devill that is to be caſt one: this power of covet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe,
is he that does countenance murder and theft in them that main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines
his Kingdom by the ſword of Iron, and puniſhes it in others: and
ſo that vvhich is called a ſin in the Common people, if they act ſuch things,
is counted no ſin in the action of Kings, becauſe the have they povver of the
ſvvord in their hands, the fear whereof makes people to feare them.</p>
            <p>But ſince this Kingly Office by the Parliament, is caſt out of <hi>England,</hi>
and <hi>England</hi> by them is declared to be a free State or Common-wealth, we
are in the firſt place thereby ſet free from thoſe bonds and ties that the
Kings laid upon us: Therefore this Tyranny of one over another, as of
Lords of Mannors over the Common people, and for people to be forced
to hire Lavvyers to plead their cauſes for them, vvhen they are able to
plead themſelves, ought to be taken away vvith the Kingly Office, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they are the ſtrength of the Ancient Prerogative cuſtom.</p>
            <p>Secondly we juſtifie out digging upon <hi>George</hi>'s hill to make the Earth a
common Treaſury, becauſe all ſorts of people have lent aſſiſtance of purſe
and perſon to caſt out the Kingly Office, as being a burden <hi>England</hi>
groaned under; therefore thoſe from vvhom money and blood vvas received,
ought to obtain freedom in the Land to themſelves and Poſterity, by the
Law of contract between Parliament and People.</p>
            <p>But all ſorts, poor as well as rich, Tenant as vvell as Landlord, have paid
Taxes, Free-quarter, Exciſe, or adventured their lives, to caſt out that
Kingly Office.</p>
            <p>Therefore, all ſorts of people ought to have freedom in the Land of this
their nativity, vvithout reſpecting perſons, novv the Kingly Office is caſt
out, by their joynt aſſiſtance. And thoſe that doe impriſon, oppreſſe and
take avvay the livelihood of thoſe that riſe up to take Poſſeſſion of this
purchaſed freedome, are Traitors to this Nation, and Enemies to righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe:
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:117589:6"/>
And of this number are thoſe men that have arreſted, or that may
arreſt the Diggers, that endeavour to advance freedom; therefore I ſay all
ſorts ought to have their freedom.</p>
            <p>And that in regard they have not only joyned perſons and purſes together,
but in regard likewiſe, they took the Nationall Covenant, vvith joynt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
together, which the Parliament did make, of whom Mr <hi>Drake</hi> that

vvhereof was this, That every one in his ſeverall place and calling, ſhould

Poſſeſſion o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>

all that ſhall oppoſe us in this righteous vvork of making the Earth
a common Treaſury; and not to bear us, impriſon us, or take away our
eſtates or lives, unleſſe they will wilfully break Covenant with God and
man, to pleaſe their own covetous frovvard hears, and thereby declare
themſelves to be the worſt of Devils.</p>
            <p>Therefore, in that we doe d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>g upon that Hill, we do not thereby take
away other mens rights neither do we demand of this Court, or from the
Parliament, what is theirs and not ours: But we demand our own to be ſet

of K<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ngly Prerogative; and let us have no more gods to rule over us, but
the King of righteouſneſſe only.</p>
            <p>Therefore as the Free-holders claime a quietneſſe and freedom in their
incloſures, as it is fit they ſhould have, ſo we that are younger brothers, or
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:117589:6"/>
the poore oppreſſed, vve claime our freedome in the Commons, that ſo
elder and younger brother may live quietly and in peace, together freed

            <p>THus we have in writing declared in effect, what we ſhould ſay, if we
had liberty to ſpeak before you, declaring withall, that your Court
cannot end this Controverſie in that equity and reaſon of it, which wee
ſtand to maintaine: Therefore we have appealed to the Parliament, who
have received our Appeal and promiſed an Anſwer, and we wait for it;
And we leave this with you, and let Reaſon and righteouſneſſe be our
Iudge; therefore we hope you will do nothing raſhly, but ſeriouſly conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of this cauſe before you proceed to execution upon us.</p>
            <p>You ſay God will blaſt our work, and you ſay, you are in the right, and
we are in the wrong: Now if you be Chriſtians, as you ſay you are;
Then doe you act love to us, as we doe to you; and let both ſides waite
with patience on the Lord to ſee who be bleſſes; but if you oppoſe by
violence, arreſt us judge, condemn and execute us, and yet will not ſuffer
us to ſpeak for our ſelves, but you will force us to give money to our
Enemies to ſpeak for us, ſurely you cannot ſay your cauſe is right; but
hereby you juſtifie our cauſe to be right, becauſe you are the Perſecutors of

            <p>Then they came privately by day to <hi>Gerrard Winſtanleys</hi> houſe, and drove

cry conqueſt over him after his hands are tied, as they tyed ours. But if

But ſtrangers made reſcue of thoſe Cowes, and drove them aſtray out of the
Bailiffes hands, ſo that the Bailiffes loſt them; but before the Bailiffes
had loſt the Cowes, I hearing of it went to them and ſaid here is my body,
take me that I may come to ſpeak to thoſe <hi>Normans</hi> that have ſtolne
our land from us; and let the Cowes go, for they are none of mine; and
after ſome time, they telling me that they had nothing againſt my body, it
was my goods they were to have; then ſaid I take my goods, for the Cowes
are not mine: and ſo I went away and left them, being quiet in my heart,
and filled with comfort within my ſelf, that the King of righteouſneſſe
would cauſe this to work for the advancing of his own Cauſe, which I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
above eſtate or livelyhood,</p>
            <p>Saying within my heart as I went along, that if I could not get meat
to eat, I would feed upon bread, milk and cheeſe; and if they take the
Cowes, that I cannot feed on this, or hereby make a breach between me
and him that owns the Cowes, then He feed upon bread and beere, till
the King of righteouſneſſe clear up my innocency, and the juſtice of his
own cauſe: and if this be taken from me for maintaining his Cauſe, Ile
ſtand ſtill and ſee what he will doe with me, for as yet I know not.</p>
            <p>Saying likewiſe within my heart as I was walking along, O thou King
of righteouſneſſe ſhew thy power, and do thy work thy ſelf, and free thy
people now from under this heavy bondage of miſerie, <hi>Pharaoh</hi> the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous
power. And the anſwer in my heart was ſatisfactory, and full of ſweet
joy and peace: and ſo I ſaid Father, do what thou wilt, this cauſe is thine,
and thou knoweſt that the love to righteouſneſſe makes me do what I do.</p>
            <p>I was made to appeal to the Father of life in the ſpeakings of my heart
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:117589:7"/>
likewiſe thus: Father thou knoweſt that what I have writ or ſpoken, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
this light, that the earth ſhould be reſtored and become a common
Treaſurie for all mankind, without reſpect of perſons, was thy free revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to me, I never read it in any book, I heard it from no mouth of fleſh
till I underſtood it from thy teaching firſt within me. I did not ſtudy nor
imagine the conceit of it; ſelf-love to my own particular body does not
carry me along in the mannaging of this buſineſſe; but the power of love
flowing forth to the liberty and peace of thy whole Creation, to enemies
as well as friends: nay towards thoſe that oppreſſe me, endeavouring to
make me a beggar to them. And ſince I did obey thy voice, to ſpeak and
act this truth, I am hated, reproached, and oppreſſed on evere ſide. Such as
make profeſſion of thee, yet revile me. And though they ſee I cannot
fight with fleſhly weapons, yet they will ſtrive with me by that power.
And ſo I ſee Father, that <hi>England</hi> yet does chooſe rather to fight with the
Sword of Iron, and coveteouſneſſe, then by the Sword of the Spirit which
is love: and what thy purpoſe is with this land, or with my body, I know
not; but eſtabliſh thy power in me, and then do what pleaſes thee.</p>
            <p>Theſe and ſuch like ſweet thoughts dwelt upon my heart as I went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long,
and I feel my ſelf now like a man in a ſtorm, ſtanding under ſhelter
upon a hill in peace, waiting till the ſtorm be over to ſee the end of it, and
of many other things that my eye is fixed upon: But I will let this paſſe,</p>

fleſhly Lawes of this Nation, which hangs ſome for ſtealing, and

out of their thieving murdering hands.</p>
            <p>They took away the Cowes which were my livelyhood, and beat them
with their clubs, that the Cowes heads and ſides did ſwell, which grieved
tender hearts to ſee: and yet theſe Cowes never were upon <hi>George</hi> Hill,
nor never digged upon that ground, and yet the poore beaſts muſt ſuffer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe

them, the land is our inheritance, and that God gave it us, and ſhall theſe
broken fellows, and beggarly rogues take our rights from us, and have the
uſe of the land equall with us? Thus do theſe <hi>Norman</hi> Gentlemen comfort
their hearts, and ſupport themſelves with broken reeds, when they meet
together in their Counſels.</p>
            <p>But ſtay you <hi>Norman</hi> Gentlemen, let me put in a word amongſt you,
doth the murderers ſword make, any man to be Gods anointed?
Surely, Ieſus Chriſt was called Gods annointed not becauſe he conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with a Sword of iron, but becauſe he conquered by love, and the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of patience: therefore your Generall was not Gods annointed, as
Chriſt was.</p>
            <p>And then the Earth was not made to be the ſucceſſive inheritance of
children of murderers, that had the ſtrongeſt arm of fleſh, and the beſt
ſword, that can tread others under foot with a bold braſen forehead under
colour of the Law of juſtice as the <hi>Norman</hi> power does; But it was made for
all by the Law of righteouſneſſe, and he gives the whole Earth to be the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance
of every ſingle branch of mankind without reſpect of perſons, and
he that is filled with the love of this righteous King, doing as he would be
done by is a true annointed one.</p>
            <p>Therfore, that god whom you ſerve, and which did intitle you Lords,
Knights Gentlemen, and Landlords, is covetouſneſſe, the god of this
wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ld, which alwayes was a murderer, a devil and father of lies, under
whoſe dark governing power, both you and all the nations of the world
for the preſent are under. But the King of righteouſneſſe or God of love
whom I ſerve, did not call the earth your inheritance, ſhutting out others,
but gave the earth to be a common treaſurie to whole mankind (who is the
Lord of it) without reſpect of perſon.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:117589:9"/>
This power of love, is the King of righteouſneſſe, the Lord God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
that rules the whole Creation in peace, that is the Seed that breaks
covetouſneſſe the Serpents head; he is the reſtoring power, that is now
riſing up to change all things into his own nature, he will be your Iudge,
for vengance is his; and for any wrong you have done me, as I can tell you
of many, yet I have given all matters of judgment and vengance into his
hand, and I am ſure he will doe right, and diſcover him that is the true
Treſpaſſer, that take away my rights from me.</p>
            <p>And take notice of this, you Lords of Mannors, and Norman Gentry,
though you ſhould kill my body or ſtarve me in priſon, yet know, that
the more you ſtrive, the more troubles you hearts ſhall be filled with;
and doe the worſt you can to hinder publick freedom, you ſhall come
off loſers in the later end, I meane you ſhall loſe your Kingdom of

and ſhould be impriſoned; you have been told this 12 Months agoe, that
you ſhould loſe ground by ſtriving, and will you not take warning, will
you needs ſhame your ſelves, to let the poore Diggers take away your
Kingdome from you? ſurely, the power that is in them, will take the
rule and government from you, and give it a people that will make
better uſe of it.</p>
            <p>Alas! you poor blind earth mouls, you ſtrive to take away my liveli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,
and the liberty of this poor weak frame my body of fleſh, which

of darkneſſe, and to open Hell gates, and to break the Devils bands
aſunder, wherewith you are tied, that you my Enemies may live in
peace, and that is all the harm I would have you to have.</p>
            <p>Therefore you Lords of Manners, you Free-holders, you Norman-Clergy,
oppreſſing Tith-mungers, and you of the Parliament men, that
have plaid faſt and looſe with this poor Nation, for what is paſt let it

            <p>But to return again to Mr <hi>Gilders</hi> advice, the Atturney of <hi>Kingſtone</hi>
Court, and the proceeding of that Court with the Cowes; you heare how
they did judge, condemn and execute me, not ſuffering me to ſpeak; and
though thoſe four Cowes were reſcued out of their hands by ſtrangers,
not by me; and ſo by their own Law, they ſhould have looked after the
Reſcuers, yet contrary to their own Law, they came againe to <hi>Winſtanleys</hi>
dwelling a fortnight after, and drove away ſeven Cowes and a Bull in the

and yet the damage which their Norman Iury, and their covetous be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſotted

ignorant Atturney Mr <hi>Gilder,</hi> had judged me to pay for a Treſpaſſe

that they want much beeffe to vituall them and they are ſuch hungry ones,
that they will eat poor lean Cowes that are little better then skin &amp; bone;
and poor Cowes if I keep them in the winter, they are like to be poorer for
for want of Hay; for before the report of our digging was much known,
I bought three Acres of graſſe of a Lord of a Mannor, whom I will not
here name becauſe I know the councel of others made him prove falſ to me;
for when the time came to Mow, I brought mony to pay him before hand;
but he anſwered me, I ſhould not have it, but ſold it to another before my

to preach down the Diggers, have bid the people neither to buy nor ſell
with us, but to beat us, impriſon us, or baniſh us; and thereby they prove

and yet ſpeak like a Dragon, &amp; ſo they fulfill that Scripture in <hi>Rev.</hi> 13. 16.

Lords, Knights, Gentlemen, Lawyers, Bailiffes, Prieſts, and all the <hi>Norman</hi> ſnap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſack
boyes, and ammunition women to the old <hi>Norman</hi> Camp do all combine to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
in the art of unrighteous fury, to drive the poore diggers off from their work,
that the name of commmunity and freedome which is Chriſt, may not be known in
earth. Thus I have deale plainly with you all, and I have not flattered Parliament,
Army, City, nor Countrey, but have declared in this, and other writings the whole
light of that truth revealed to me by the word of the Lord: and I ſhall now wait to
ſee his hand to do his own work in what time, and by what inſtruments he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.
And I ſee the poore muſt firſt be picked out, and honoured in this work, for they
begin to receive the word of righteouſneſſe, but the rich generally are enemies to tru
freedome.</p>

            <p>Mr <hi>Drake,</hi> you are a Parliament man, and was not the beginning of the quarrel
between King <hi>Charles</hi> and your Houſe? This the King pleaded to uphold Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,
and you were againſt it, and yet muſt a Parliament man be the firſt man to up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
Prerogative, who are but ſervants to the Nation for the peace and liberty of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
one, not conquering Kings to make their wil a Law? did you not promiſe liberty
to the whole Nation, in caſe the Cavalier party were caſt out? and why now wil you
ſeek liberty to your ſelf and Gentry, with the deniall of juſt liberty and freedome to
the common people, that have born the greateſt burden?</p>
            <p>You have arreſted us for digging upon the common Land, you have executed your unrighteous
power, in diſtraining cat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

neither can it be proved that we have broke any Law, that is built upon equity and reaſon, therfore
we wonder where you had your power to rule over us by will, more th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

declare that you have done wrong to Chriſt, who you ſay is your Lord and maſter, in abuſing us his
