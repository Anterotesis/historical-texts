         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>ALthough I have nothing of Custom Affairs, yet have I something of a more acceptable Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentment unto you at this time to impart un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you.</p>
            <p>It hath pleased God to honor this Town yesterday, at about three of the Clock in the Afternoon, with the happy Arival of His Most Excellent Majesty, with the Illustrious Princes, the Dukes of <hi>York</hi> and <hi>Glocester,</hi> many Noblemen, Knights, and Gentlemen with him.</p>
            <p>The Town was very much filled with many Lords and persons of great Quality and their Attendants; as also with several Troops of Horse and Gentlemen of the County, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending the Right Honorable the Earl of <hi>Winchelsey,</hi> who were very much increased by the Accession of his Excellency the Lord General <hi>Monck,</hi> with a very great number of Gentlemen, and several Troops of Horse, who came to this Town at about one of the Clock after Dinner the same day, to wait upon his Majesty at his first Landing, who with many thousands of people of all degrees, stood upon the Beach, with longing expectation of that most pleasant vision.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:101677:3"/>When His Majesty left the Ship, (<hi>Charles</hi> the quondam <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>) in which be came, and went into the Barge that brought him to Land, the Guns from the whole Fleet, and afterwards the Guns of the Castle roared like continued Claps of thunder, during the space of about half an hour, and the people contended with them to out-noise them (if it were possible) with joyful Shoutings and Acclamations, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued (some short intermissions excepted to take breath) until his Landing, and a good while after; the great Guns from the Castle also again thundering forth the Joys of that Garison.</p>
            <p>Upon his Approach towards the shore, his Excellency the Lord General <hi>Monck</hi> did hastily run unto the very extream of a Bridge, made on purpose to accommodate His Majesties convenient Landing, and kneeled down to receive His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty, and His Majesty embraced him in his arms; and His Majesty also kneeled down, with his eyes and hands lifted up towards heaven, but I have not heard of any words ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered then by him, desiring, it seems, to be as much in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret as such an act at that time and place could permit him to be, and to speak more to God in his minde, then he thought mee<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> should be heard by men. The two Dukes al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so kneeled down, congratulated his happy Arival, and kiss'd his hand.</p>
            <p>Then he advanced towards a Canopy, a Chair, Cushion, and Carpet spread upon the Beach where the Mayor of the Town, with his brethren the Jurats, Common-Councel-Men, all in their Gowns, and Freemen of the best quality, in the best equipage they could, waited for his Majesties lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding; The Trumpets, and Waits making all possible melody they could in the mean time.</p>
            <p>When he came thither, the Mayor upon his knee made a short speech his Majesty three times bidding him rise up and speak: The Mayors speech contained a congratulation of his most happy and prosperous arival in such Honor, peace, and safety, his great preservations in many difficulties, and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:101677:3"/>
the wonderful providence of God ordering and termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nating all our late troubles, and revolutions of Government with peace, and without blood in the restauration of his Majesty, and his People unto their respective rights, the most cordial affections of all his people unto him, and his gracious clemency and goodness declared unto them &amp;c. resigning up his white staff (the badge of his authority) unto his Majesty; which he returned again unto the Mayor.</p>
            <p>Then the Mayor by the hands of an ancient, reverend, and learned Minister, Mr. <hi>Readdin,</hi> presented his Majesty with a rich Bible prepared by the Townsmen for that purpose, signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying in a very short speech the most confident presumptions of his people, that nothing would be more acceptable unto him, then the glory of God, in the defence of the protestant religion contained in that Book.</p>
            <p>The said Mr. <hi>Readdin</hi> upon his knees kist his Majesty's hand, and beginning to speak, his Majesty commanded him to rise up, which accordingly he did, and made a short, but very pious and pithy speech, importing the inestimable treasures of divine riches contained in that Book, presuming, and bespeaking his Majesty's most pious care of it, and affections to it concluding with a holy wish that it might be unto him and his family as the Ark of old was unto the house of <hi>Obed-edom</hi> shuting up all with <hi>God save the King,</hi> and let all the people say Amen. which they did with a very great shout, joy and cheerfulness.</p>
            <p>His Majesty took the Book into his hands from the said Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister with a most gracious and pleasant Countenance, and with a most grave, serious, and soft voice said, that nothing was, and should be more dear unto him then the Bible, and so he gave it to a Gentleman next unto him, and also called for the velvet bag to put it in, and after it was put into his coach.</p>
            <p>His Majesty then embraced several Noblemen who kissed his hand, and the hands of the most Illustrious Princes, his two brothers, upon which, his Majesty the said Princes, and the Lord <hi>Monck,</hi> went into his Majesty's Coach, and immediatly
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:101677:4"/>
road away with a very great number of Noblemen &amp;c. with him towards <hi>Canterbury.</hi> This small Town being not able to entertain them, so many thousands with their Horses, Coaches and country people &amp;c.</p>
            <p>I had the honor and happiness of entertaining some of his Majesties family, and other persons of honor, interest, &amp; inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy with his Majesty, from whom I had so many assurances, convincing Arguments, and instances of his Majesties piety, clemency, sweetness of nature, temperance, meekness, pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, mercifulness, tenderness of spirit towards all ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest peaceable men, readiness to forgive, aversness to revenge, &amp;c. as I must confess I did not expect, and which (being true) gives great cause to bewail, and lament the evil of those that have otherways represented him, especially if against their knowledge, and consciences; as also the unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness of the Nation that hath been so long injured by his detention from them. And which gives great assurance of our future felicity, if we know, consider, and wisely improve the things belonging unto our peace.</p>
            <p>One of the said persons assured me that within these very few days his Majesty was speaking with some Gentlemen concerning his party in <hi>England,</hi> and had these words—I hear there are many swearers, drunkards, and profane per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons that say they are of my party, but they are of the devils party, and not of my party, I renounce them.</p>
            <p>I have heard also several other expressions and instances to the same purpose, which because they cannot be mentioned without some reflection of disparagement to persons who cannot but know themselves concerned and meant therein, if it should be spoken of, I think not fit to particula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rize.</p>
            <p>I have seen also a letter of his Majesties own hand writing which was accidentally produced upon occasion of our discourse, arguing a very pious and excellent temper and disposition in him, which because his Majesties letter, and fearing it should both offend his Majesty and also the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:101677:4"/>
himself, should that also be spoken of which his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty writ privately, and was privately discoursed of by us, I forbear to mention.</p>
            <p>I pray pardon my prolixity, and let the happiness of the occasion, and subject thereof attain the same, and accept of the humble respects of,</p>
