            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

But because I would not be thoughte to counsel others, that haue more need my selfe to be taught: to set forth orders for others that ought rather to be guided: and to direct others that am more meete to be ledde: therefore what I haue written to that end is none other thing than that whiche now is obeyed, and most diligently folo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed throughout that most ciuil countrey called <hi>Mauqsun.</hi> The like whereof is not elsewhere so vniuersally practised. And thoughe the things thereof written, wil be hardly credited (but more faintly folo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed) for that they are so rare and strange, and in such an vnknown place: yet they are not to be reiected as false, considering it is harder for the reporter thereof to tel a lye, than for a common lyar to tell a true tale, which must needes be granted, if his name called <hi>OMEN,</hi> and the name of his Countrey called <hi>Mauqsun</hi> (before mentioned) be aduisedly marked and considered, especially <hi>è conuerso</hi> construed. And nowe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for that the maruellous maners, the honest behauiour, the faithful friendship, the curteous conditions, the commendable cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomes, the plain meaning and true dealing, the Lords liberalitie, the Ladies great curtesie, the husbands fidelitie, the wiues obedience, the maydens modestie, the maisters sobrietie, the seruants diligence, the Magistrates affabilitie, the Iudges equitie, the commons amitie, the preferring of publique commoditie, the generall Hospitali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,

the exceeding mercie, the wonderful Charitie, and the constant Christianitie of that Countrey is such: I hope the honest affectioned wil hereby take no small pleasure and profite. Not ignoraunt, that there are not a fewe of an other secte, that loath they ought to loue: disdaine, they ought to desire: fleere at that they ought rather to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uor: and discommend that they cannot amend. Which if euery Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter shoulde haue weyed, many good things had lyen hid, that now are vttered: great knowledge would haue bin kept close, that now is dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered: and many profitable things vnknowen, that now are practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed. And therfore, as they respected rather to pleasure some honestly, than to please many foolishly: so I meane hereby rather to content the wel minded with things commendable, than to flatter fooles with vnnecessarie matter. Trusting your Honor wil rather weigh my good wil and zeale, than my rude rashenesse: in that I presume to presente vnto you such a simple gift. Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>forted herewith, that seeing the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sian Prince was contente to accepte a poore mans handfull of water, (which had no better thing to giue him) I hope your Honour will take in good parte this handful of paper, not withoute something in it, whiche is the beste thing nowe I am able to giue you.

Thinking my selfe happily recompenst, if you receiue it but halfe as thankefully, as I doe giue it faithfully and willingly. Thus o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting any further herein to trouble your Honour, desires God ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly to guide you in goodnesse, to defende you from dangers, to fence you from foes, to lende you long life, and to bring you to blisse,</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S I haue published this (gentle Reader) to pleasure and profit many, so I wish the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning thereof not to be hyd from any, which though I haue described at large in my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Epistle, yet for that I thinke many will not reade the same (as I wish they woulde,) herin I haue displayed the effect and discourse thereof, which is, that one SIVQILA, a man that lyued godlye, loued ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestie, and esteemed equitie, was so wearie with the wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, naughtinesse, falsehode and other great enormities of his owne Countrie, that he trauelled to finde out a Countrie and people that were agreable to his owne affection. Who, at the last, when he had trauelled thorowout the whole world, as he thought, chanced to meete with one whose name was OMEN, dwelling in a countrie there called MAVQSVN: wherein, as he sayde, generally be such blessed Byshops, such perfect Preachers, suche vertuous Ministers, suche godly Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours, suche merciful Magistrates, suche iust Iudges, suche worthie Lawes, suche charitable Lawyers, such honest Attor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys, suche pitifull Physitions, such friendlie Surgeons, suche liberal Lordes, suche lowlie Ladies, such gentle Gentlemen, such louing Husbandes, such obedient Wiues, suche humble Children, such modest Maydes, such diligent Seruantes, such good and plaine Dealing, such Hospitalitie, such wonderfull Charitie, such practizing of Godlinesse, and such stryuing to Do wel, that the same SIVQVILA did wonder at it, saying, It is TOO GOOD TO BE TRVE: wherof this Booke hath his title, which if the Discourse therof be wel marked, I doubt not but that it will like the Godlie, please the Honest, and warne the Wicked. And therefore, as I haue taken long paynes in framing it, so I beseech thee take a little paynes to reade it thorowly, which is al that I wish. And thus I ende.</p>

But Simon Magus, one of another reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion (that loued gayne more than godlynesse) would haue come by the holy Ghost at the Apostles hands for mony, as many get spiritual liuings now-adayes, wherevpon it may rightly be called Simony.

If they will credite Christe, (who is well worthye to be beléeued) then they cannot be doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, but that there is a Hell: for he sayeth, <hi>Whosoeuer sayth thou foole, shall be in daunger of Hell fire:</hi> and he sayeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine: <hi>It is better for thee, that one of thy members perishe, than all thy body shoulde be caste into Hell:</hi> What néede I recite the wordes of the Prophets or Apostles, that in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers places name Hell? If any be so incredulous, that they will not beléeue Christe, they will hardelye beléeue eyther Prophet, Apostle, or any other. But I will promise them one thing, whosoeuer wyl not beléeue Christe nowe, they shall beléeue him agaynste theyr wylles at the laste daye, at whych tyme he wil saye, <hi>Goe yee wicked into euerlasting fyre, prepared for you from the begynnyng.</hi> And then with al the mighte and power they haue, let them proue hym a<note place="margin">Marke.</note> lyar, or wythstande him if they can. No, no, hée wil be too hard for them there: for, though the Iewes ouermatcht hym here with hys wyl: he wil ouermatch them &amp; al his enimies there against their wils. As there is a God that will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect and defend the godly: so there is a Diuel (yea a maister Diuel) besides manye thousandes of other Diuels that
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:9438:12"/>
will torment and punish the wicked. And as there is a hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen where the godly and faithful beléeuers shall haue euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting<note place="margin">a pleasant discourse where the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uel should be if there were no Hel.</note> ioy and pleasure: so there is a Hell, where the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked and infidels shall haue endlesse sorrowe and paines: or else, if there were no Hell, where shoulde the dyuel, with al his vnder diuels kéepe hys residence? not in Heauen I am sure, for God did thruste hym out from thence for his pride, but not to come thither again. And though heauen be great and large, yet it cannot hold them both: and to say truth, the Diuel is suche an enimie to God, that he wil not haue such an euil neighbor so nigh him.</p>

               <p>And if there were a Purgatorie (as I am sure<note place="margin">If ther were a Purgatory yet the Diuel could not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine there.</note> there is none) though some dolts do dreame of such a place, yet the Diuell coulde not be there, for it should likewise bée consumed wyth the earth, for that it is placed in the centre of the earth, as it is imagined. But if their imagined Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatorie should be saued from destruction, I thinke the Pope (the chiefe protector of Purgatorie) woulde not suffer the great Diuell, wyth suche a rabble of other Diuels, to take<note place="margin">The Pope would keepe the diuell fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> possession of Purgatorie.</note> possession there: whiche hathe bin one of the richest Manors that euer he had. Nor it coulde not well stand wyth his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse, (thoughe the Diuell were his deare friend) to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>place the séely soules that haue payed rent for it afore hand: especially such of them as he hathe pardoned manye yeares<note place="margin">Marke thes whole dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course of pur gatorie, &amp; the poore soules that are in it.</note> after the daye of Iudgement: for though the date of some of their pardons are out already, yet manye of them will not be expired of a great while after. Now sir, if any of them are such as are appointed to go to Heauen, they wil tarry there no longer (if they be wise.) And they that are appointed to be damned, they will not goe from thence wyth a good will. And further, the Pope shoulde do them much wrong, if they
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:9438:12"/>
shoulde be put out of their place of priuiledge before their lease is expired. And many haue this opinion of the Popes good grace, that he will doe neuer a liuyng man wrong: Then it is to be thought (if he be of that power as he is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to be) he will defend the poore Soules in Purgatorie in their right, whereby it behoueth him to withstand God, that he do not consume it at the last day, when all the rest shall be destroyed with fire. And thus the Pope must néedes kéepe the poore Soules in peaceable and quiet possession, in despight of the Diuell, and all that take his part.</p>

            <sp>

               <p>Yea truely, if that be lost that doth them no good, nay rather continual harme, for the Pope and his dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings for the gréedinesse of mony, bringeth y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> simple people into such a fooles Paradise, that he will saue them: which is the occasio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of their damnatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, by beleuing &amp; trusting to him.</p>

               <p>And therefore if the Diuell should gette the possession of Purgatorie, then the miserable soules were as good to be in Hel with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Diuel, as the Diuell to be in Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatorie with them. Nowe, considering the Diuell can not dwell in Heauen, neyther in the Earth, Water, nor in the fierie Region, nor in Purgatorie, (if there were any suche) then surely he must néedes of force dwell in Hell, for there is no other place for him to be in, vnlesse he be no where.</p>

               <p>Alteration (quoth you) tutte it is wonderfull, for at the first preaching thereof, the men came to the Sermons like Maskers, and the women lyke Players. Where at the<note place="margin">Note heere.</note> Preacher was so amazed, that he was ready to go out of the Pulpit, for he thought verily (séeing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in that order) that

there would haue bin either a play, a mummerie, or a May<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>game: But when he vnderstood certainly, that they came to heare the Sermon, he framed his spéeche in suche order vnto them, somtimes with mild and gentle exhortations with the swéet promises of God for doing wel, bringing Christ for an exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to follow, saying: Though he was the sonne of<note place="margin">A good prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher.</note> God, &amp; equal to God the father in respect of his godhead, yet he became pore, humble, méek, gentle, merciful, &amp; charitable, &amp; went daily in simple and pore attyre, &amp; finally dyed to make vs liue.

Or, if we shoulde haue posted him ouer to some other to declare his cause, &amp; not to haue hearde it our selues: then thou wouldst haue found such meanes, that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther<note place="margin">Truly saide.</note> he shold not haue bin heard, but put off with fair words fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> time to time, or to be threatned or imprisoned for presu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to complaine on such a noble man that is so nigh our person: as thoughe suche as you, had auctoritie to do what wrong you list.

with great reaso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be much more punished, for nothelping, or denying thy louing father: and bycause thou hast done to him as thou wouldest not haue him do to thée, thou shalt be done to, as thou hast done to him. Therefore my iudgement and sentence is, that presently thou shalt be depriued of all thine honorable estate and offices whatsoeuer: al which we<note place="margin">The Kings worthy iudge ment.</note> wil bestowe on suche as we thinke worthy thereof: and all thy lands and goods, whereof nowe thou arte possessed, wée clearly take from thée, and doe gyue al the same to thy pore father here, whome thou disdaynedst or denyedst: straightly commaunding and charging him, that he shall neuer gyue thée, nor suffer thée to enioy any part therof, neither shal suc cour nor reléeue thée therewith: and the apparell that thou dost nowe weare, he shal haue, and thou shalte haue this thy fathers pore attyre, and weare it likewise: and thou shalte humble thy self to thys thy father, but he shal not onely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse to reléeue thée, but also shal refuse thée for his son. And also my iudgement is, that thou presume not at anye tyme hereafter to come in our presence, neyther wythin seauen myles of our Court, vpon paine of death: And this is oure finall sentence and iudgement, whych shall not be reuoked. And when the King had thus saide, a great sorte did reioice, that they had suche a king, that did giue so seuere and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous iudgement of that wicked sonne, not regarding him, thought he was of suche honor, and so highly in his fauour.</p>

               <p>There was one wyth vs that was very rich that gaue himself to nothing but to drinking, bibbing and belli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chere: who was not only drunke almost euery day, but also when he was sober, he made his brags, that he spe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t more at the Tauerns, and in wine euery day, than ten of his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors spent in a daye in their houses. Of whose behauioure whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ruler heard, he sent for him, and as soone as he came before him, he saide to him: Are you he sirra, that is such a drunken drinker, that spendes more dayly at the Tauerne and in wine, than ten of your neighbors spendes daylye in their houses? Then the rich drunkard knéeled down before the sayd Ruler, and desired him to be good to him, saying it was not true: wyth that the witnesses accused hym, as well of his wordes as of his drunkennesse. Then the Iudge said to him, how sayest thou nowe, thinkest thou I wil beléeue thée, and discredite so many honest persons? I perceiue thou hast ynough to spend to hurt thy selfe, but thou hast neuer a<note place="margin">Marke this well.</note> whit to giue to thy pore neyghboure to doe him good. Thou wicked wretche (said hée) if thou shouldest be constrayned to gyue the fourth part for the defence of thy countrey, of that which thou spendest in one yere to shorten thy life, or to kil thy selfe: thou wouldst think thou were vndone. It séemes
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:9438:32"/>
thou hast a pride in thy excesse and drunkennes, or else thou wouldst neuer haue so bragged of the same. Doest thou con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider what a double mischief grows of thy vain spending of thy mony? if thou doest not, I will tel thée, thou killest thy selfe by taking too much, and the pore hungry wretch is kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led that hath too little. Now if thou shold giue thy too much, to the pore that hath too little: thou shouldst saue bothe your liues, whereas now thou art a murtherer of both. And now thou art not only proued a drunkard, but a double murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer: and thou knowest, that neither drunkards nor murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers shal enioy the kingdom of Heauen: then they shall bée sure to obtaine the kingdom of Hell. Ah wicked wretch, dost thou shorten thy life, to goe the sooner to Hel? they that bée there would not make such haste I beléeue thither, if they were here againe. Is it not a strange thing y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> thou shouldest be so prodigall, to hurt thy selfe here, to go to Hel: and art so niggardly in doing good to Christ in his members, to go vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to heauen? A thou thurle, more churlish tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a hog or swine, for though somtimes they driue their fellows from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> meat and eat by themselues: yet when they haue filled the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues sufficiently, they go away, and leaue the reste, eate it who wil. But thou gréedie cormorant, when thou haste taken more than is sufficient, thou dost not only consume more on thy selfe, but also the rest thou kepest from thy pore hungry brother, and wilt not leaue any thyng for him, as the swine doth. And now séeing Gods law cannot moue thée to go vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Heauen, I wil sée if our law can stay thée from hel. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, bicause y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> hast so much welth, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> thou ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>st not tell howe to bestow the same wel, and more liuing tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thou art wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of: therefore I wil according to the law made for drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kards, that thou shalt giue yerely during thy life, a prechers stipend to a godly learned man, for his better maintenance, who shall be bound euery wéeke thrée times during thy life, not onely to attend vpon thée one halfe hour at a time, then instructing thée (by the scriptures) thy duty to God and ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and the way to saluation, persuading thée also fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,

and shewing also howe detestable it is before GOD, and what is the gaine thereof: But also shall preache thrée dayes euery wéeke in the parish Churche where thou dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lest. And thou shalt sitte also thrée market dayes in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen market with a pot in thy hand, &amp; a writing on thy fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, as followeth: This is the Drunkarde that spente as much dayly at the Tauernes and for wine, as tenne of his nexte neighbors did spende daylye in their houses. And this being ended, thou shalte<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> remayne one halfe yeare in prison, and there thou shalte be taughte to fast for thy long excesse: for euery dinner thou shalt hée allowed not aboue a groate, in bread, drinke, and meate: and thou shalte be allo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed nothing but breade and drinke at night in stead of thy supper, whych shal not be aboue the value of a penny. And bycause thou diddest bragge of thy vaine daylye spending, therefore thou shalte giue daylye for the space of one halfe yeare, (that is, during thy imprisonment) as much to tenne of the porest housholders next vnto thée, towards the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of their houses, as thou arte allowed daylye to thy dinner. And this is my iudgement not to be called back, and with all spéed to be executed. And then he was committed to the Officers and things were done and performed accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly.

               <p>If al that lose their virginitie before they bée maried, in some places, should be torn with maides téeth of their own age: I feare they would be as able to beat them, as the other to byte them. Though in the most places tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe straite looking to, and good bringing vp of yong Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels, there woulde be scant a bitte for euery one. And though heretofore, when Gods worde lay hid and vnknowne, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destie, shamefastnesse, virginitie, and chastetie, was so estée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med<note place="margin">Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sider this.</note> and vsed, that it was a wonder to sée one maid miscary once in a dozen yeare in a whole towne: yet nowe, (not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding Gods worde be plentifully preached) virgini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie is so little regarded, and chastitie so little estéemed, that foure or fiue in one yeare is thought no great matter. Oh, if we did consider déepely the greate cause we haue to kéepe our bodies cleanly, chastely, and godly, we would not féede them so voluptuously, vse them so viciously, nor couer them so costly. For, if our bodies be chaste and holy, God the holy Ghost wil dwel in them, preserue them, and instruct them. But mark the naughtines of our nature. For, if an earthly King shoulde determine to come into a pore mannes house,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:9438:36"/>
to tarry there but one houre, should not that house be made cleane in euery corner? should it not be made trimme, fine<note place="margin">This is to be noted.</note> and swéet, as might be? woulde not the owner of the house reioyce and be glad, and partly bragge of the Kings com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to his house? Yes I warrant you. Then how muche more ought we to decke vp this our body, that is, to fasten it with the foundation of Faith, to place it in the table of<note place="margin">Note this.</note> Temperance, to purifie it through with perfect Prayer, to hang it all ouer with the clothes of Chastitie, to make in the chimney thereof the fire of Charitie, to swéepe it cleane with the béesome of Bewayling, and to lighten the whole house with the lanterne of Loue, where we are most sure, that God the holy Ghost will come, and be contente to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habite and dwell continually.</p>

               <p>We haue an excellent good law for such: but we haue such excellent people, that they neuer break that law: therfore it hath bene so long vnoccupyed, that fewe or none with vs knowes that there is any such law. I heard one say when I was young, that in the olde time long agoe, two théeues laid waite by the way for one that they knew wold come that waye with a greate deale of money, who, as soone as they met with him there, they carried him into a wood or thicke Groue that was nigh to that place, and first they cut off both his hands, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they gaue him aboue twe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ty wou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds: after that they did cut his throte, &amp; also so mangled his face, that it was impossible to know him therby: and they spoiled him of his apparell, and left him dead and all naked: who after being suspected &amp; apprehended, confessed the murther, and wherefore they did it: then the Iudge sayd vnto them, what is the sentence of Christ, that the King commaundes so straightly to be kepte? to whome the murtherers sayde: <hi>Whatsoeuer you will that men shall do to you, euen so do ye<note place="margin">How two murtherers were vsed.</note> to them.</hi> The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Iudge said to y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> murtherers, rightly sayd, therefore ye shal be done vnto, as ye haue done to the man you haue killed: and then he gaue vpon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this iudgement following: you shall haue both your hands cut off: then you shal haue twentie wou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds giuen you with a sword: the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> your throates shal be cut, &amp; your faces shal be so mangled as you

mangled his face: and when you are throughly deade, then you shall be cutte into small péeces, and they shall be thro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen abroade, for the beastes and Rauens to eate. And as soone as the Iudge had giuen on them this iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, they were carryed away, &amp; wer immediatly killed &amp; mangled in suche order as the Iudge had appointed. So that neuer since any hath bin killed or murthered in al our Country, not so much for fear of mans law as of Gods law, which they are maruellous fearful to breake. And euer since the Preacher said in the Pulpit, whosoeuer saith <hi>Thou foole, is in daunger of Hel fyre,</hi> they haue bin very muche afraide.

Christe is worthy to be credited, which sayeth: <hi>Be not carefull for your life, what you shal eate, or what you shal drinke, nor yet for your body what you shall put on: is not the life more worth than meat? &amp; the body more of value than rayment? Behold, the foules of the aire, for they sow not, neither reape, nor carry into the barnes, and your heauenly Father feedeth them: are yee not much better than they? Whyche of you by taking thought can put one Cubite to his stature? and why care yee then for rayment? Consider the Lillies of the fielde how they growe, they labour not, neyther spinne, and yet I tell you that <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> in al his royaltie was not arayed lyke vnto one of these. Wherefore, if God so clothe the grasse, whych is to day in the fielde, and to morrowe shall be caste into the Fornace, shall not he much more doe the same vnto you, o ye of litle faith?

In these wordes he hathe named God to be our father twice, besides in diuers other places. Then séeyng he that cannot lye, doth saye, that God is our father, how ioyful may we be that haue such a father? Ther fore we may be well assured, that if earthly Fathers &amp; mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers doe féede their chyldren: he wil féede his children.

As if he allure the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to loue, then they embrace loue in stéed of hatred: if to quietnesse and peacemaking, then with all diligence they bring the contentious to concorde, and furious foes to be faithful friends: if to be charitable and merciful, then pre sently the richer sort succours their néedie neighbors, going from house to house, to vnderstand their necessity: they visit the sicke, and comforte them both with counsaile and coine: they resort vnto prisons, where not only they persuade the prisoners wyth Gods promises to be patient and penitent, but also mitigate their miseries wyth money and meate:

and what else? truely, they clothe the naked, féede the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry, and harbour the harbourlesse. For al their studie, ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour, and delight is, to do the workes of mercie: knowing, that the doers therof shall remaine in heauen with Christe, and the neglecters therof shal dwel in Hel with the Diuell.

               <p>I woulde to God they didde bestowe the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>both daye so well with vs. I thinke verily, if anye daye bée more profaned with vs than other, it is the Sabboth daye, that God hathe appointed to be kept most holy. For I doubt many do come to the Churche that day more to pry, than to pray: more to looke, than to learne: more to shew themselues, than to shunne sinne: more to marke others, than to amend themselues: more for custome, than conscience: and more to heare a fine preaching, than to followe the godlye teaching. And if many of them doe thus, that come to the Churche, what may be thought of them that come not to the Church? Many are constrayned to labour for their liuing in the wéek day, whereby they auoyde ydlenesse the mother of mischief, wherof many I feare, though they are not ydle on the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>both day, they are not wel occupyed. For that day they giue themselues to Drinking, Dicing, Dauncing, Swearing, chaffing, Playing, Bowling, Beare-baiting, and to other vanities: and this is the regard that they haue to God, vsing themselues that day most wickedly, that God woulde haue them liue most holily.</p>

               <p>It is not so with vs, for truely y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> people are so péeuishly addicted, that they estéeme Wealth aboue Wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and as it séemes, they thinke that the wealthye are wise, &amp; the poore are fooles.

But if the said rich man doth fal into pouerty, and the same poore man chance to be rich, then <hi>Totnam</hi> is turned Fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ch, and then the foole is sodainly become wise, and the wise ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a foole. So that hereby it muste néedes appeare, that it is<note place="margin">Marke.</note> Wealth that makes Wisedome, &amp; pouertie makes fooles, For, when Wealth is gone, all Wisedome is gone: &amp; when Pouertie is gone, then all Foolishnesse is gone.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>OMEN.</speaker>
               <p>It is not so with vs, for if a wise riche man doe chaunce to come to pouersie, he is not onely prouided for, that he shal haue sufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to liue on during his life, but his<note place="margin">Note here</note> counsayle is required and taken in vrgente affayres and wayghtie matters as well as it was before: for God, not Wealth giueth Wisedome.</p>

               <speaker>SIVQILA.</speaker>
               <p>I woulde it were so with vs: but truely I haue seldome séene, that their counsayle is craued béeyng fallen in decaye, that haue in their Wealth borne great au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, thoughe they were well worthy for their wytte and honest behauioure. Therefore wée maye sée, that Wealth, more than Wisdome: goods, more than goodnesse: and aucthoritie more than abilitie is preferred: whiche me thinks is very preposterous. For, who will estéeme a Horse the worse for hauing nothing but a halter on his head? and who wil estéem a iade the better for his saddle &amp; trim trap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers? The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> if we estéeme a horse for his goodnes and agility,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:9438:42"/>
should we not accept a man for his knowledge and honesty? Wealth cannot make a foole the wiser, nor Pouerty cannot make the wise man foolisher. For the foole cannot tel how to vse himselfe in wealth: but the wise man can tel how to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haue himselfe in pouerty. Where wisedome wants, wealth may wast: and where wisedome is (though worldly wealth may decay) the minde cannot choose but be riche. Therefore it is better to haue a rich mind with Wisedome, than a full purse with Follie.</p>

               <p>We woulde cut out their tongues, if no wayes would warne them. If one should sweare with vs (as it is

               <p>Oh that we had that law and well executed.

And by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he soughte no more but his lyfe, he deuised wordes of high treason, that he should speake against the King, and he

enformed y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Ruler there, of his own deuised wordes, saying, that he himself heard him speake the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.

And then y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> man remembring himselfe, knéeled downe and saide: O my God and heauenly father, thou knowest whether I am guilty in this that is layde to my charge or not: as thou deliueredst <hi>Daniel</hi> out of the Lyons denne, the thrée children out of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Whyche, when he had done, he found euery one of them agrée in one tale. And then the Ruler said to the accused man, these men doe all agrée, that in such a place, and in such a day, and how thou didst speake such words against the King: therfore, as farre as I séé, I muste be constrained to giue iudgement a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst thée, according to the lawe. At whose wordes the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused man knéeled downe again, and said with wéeping tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res: Oh Lord, as I am guiltlesse, so let me not be helplesse: in thée is al my hope, thou neuer deceiuest them that putte their trust in thée: thou art able to pleade in my cause. The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Ruler had him arise, and saide vnto him: I perceiue thou
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:9438:46"/>
hast a seruent trust in God. Wel, I wil charge these thy ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersaries a little straighter. Wel Maisters, thys good man whom you haue accused here of high treason, is iudged of al that knowe him, to be as faithful to God, as obedient to his Prince, and as louing to his neighbors, as curteous to stra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, as liberall to the pore, and as commodious to his cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, as any of vs al, and a great deale more than any of you thrée that haue accused him. But, for that we are to doe Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, we meane not, but according to your accusations, to procéede against him. Notwithstanding, I wil say to you by the way, that if he die guiltlesse through your false accusati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>o<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, God wil not only plague you, as long as you liue, with a troubled &amp; tormented conscience, but also with desperate minds at your deaths, whiche is the verye line that leades you to hel. Let Iudas be a pattern to you, that falsely betraid Christ his Maister: for as soone as he had taken the money y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> he betrayd him for, did he not straitways dispaire, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he neuer asked pardon of God for his fault, &amp; so desperat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hanged himself, and his vowels gushed out? &amp; so he is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the child of perdition, whereby he hath lost heauen for Hel, pleasure for pain, gladnesse for sadnesse, and God for y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Diuel. Is not this a proper gain, that his mony hath brou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghte him? Therfore you that are witnesses, if you haue take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> mony for the betraying of this accused man, your mony wil bryng you Iudas gaine, vnlesse you repent you otherwayes than <hi>Iudas</hi> did, whiche gaine, is to be for euer in the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Hel fire, with the Diuel and his Angels, and to be expulsed from the presence of God. And thereat the accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed man knéeled downe and sayde: Oh Lorde defende me,<note place="margin">Marke howe God defends y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> righteous.</note> and pleade now my cause. And as soone as the accused man had spoken these words, there came one man in great hast, and preased to come before the Iudge, saying as foloweth: Oh worthy Iudge, you sit here in the place of God the most high and greatest Iudge, &amp; the Iudge of al Iudges, to heare the truth without any partialitie, and to iudge according to right and equitie: whose faith is so firme, whose godlinesse
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:9438:47"/>
is so greate, and whose trueth is so tryed, that I am assured, that nothing can make you wrye from the righte waye. To whome the Iudge said, thereof assure thy selfe, for I know, and it is alwaies in my minde when I sit in this place, that though I cannot sée God in heauen, yet he sées and beholds me on earthe. Doe you not thinke, that if the King of our Countrey, were here nowe in this place, but that I woulde examine all things appertayning to this matter so exactly, goe aboute to boulte oute the truth with such diligence, and iudge the same without fauoure or affection according to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie, whereby to please the Kyng? yes verilye. Then howe muche more ought I to examine with equitie, try out the truth diligently, and iudge without partialitie, séeing our good God the King of all Kings, and Iudge of Iudges, is nowe present in this place, and wil not onelye heare all the whole matter from the beginning to the ende, but also wil poure his vengeance vppon you, if you witnesse falsely, and on me, if I iudge not vprightly, who heares what wée say, sées what we do, and knows what we thinke. For, if the painter can sée, that makes an eye that cannot sée, then God muste néedes sée, that made our eyes that can sée. If hée can heare, that makes an eare, that cannot heare, then God of force must néeds heare, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hath made our eares that ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> heare. And shal not he also that made our hearts likewise, knowe what we thinke in our harts? yes doubtlesse. Therfore take you gret héed, al ye that haue to speak before me in this case, for whatsoeuer you speake vnto me, either true or false, you speake to God: and if you speake true, God wil protect you, if you wil speake false, then God wil detest you. Whiche of you al, if the Kings Maiestie were here in the next roome or chamber, durst vtter a lye so loude, that the King knowing it to be a lye, should heare it? Then what is he that dare once presume to beare false witnesse against his neighbor, in the hearing of God the greate King of all, that makes Kings and puts downe Kings at his pleasure, who is present here before vs all in this place, (though not personally, yet spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually:)
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:9438:47" rendition="simple:additions"/>
therefore now my friend, I am determined to heare the trueth, to trie out the truthe, and to Iudge accordyng to truth, and therfore I charge thée speake nothing but the trueth. Then saide the same fellowe that came to speake with the Iudge so hastily: my Lorde, I hearde but euen a while since (as God woulde) that one is accused before you of high treason. Then said the Iudge, in déede here is suche a one, doest thou knowe him? there he standes besides thée. Then saide the fellowe: of trueth my Lorde, I knowe hym not, but I haue hearde him as muche commended for hys goodnesse, as this his accuser is discommended for hys euil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse: so it may be (saide the Iudge) and yet he neuer the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, nor the other the worse: for perhappes you neuer heard him commended, nor the other discommended. Yes truelye my Lorde (saide the fellowe) I haue hearde bothe, and that not of a fewe, whiche I speake here vnfaynedlye, bothe bée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Maiestie of GOD and you. And for that we are all bounde to tell the truthe, and to defende the innocente as muche as it lyeth in vs. I am come nowe in the feare of God, &amp; in singlenesse of heart, to vtter so muche vnto you, as thereby you maye the better sucke out the soothe, and try out the trueth. But firste I praye thée, saide the Iudge, doest thou knowe his accuser? yea that I doe (saide the fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe) more of his séeking than of my desiring. Well nowe tell on thy tale, saide the Iudge, and I will heare thée atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuely. Then saide the fellowe to the Iudge, thys accuser here that hath accused this man for highe treason againste the King, was very importunate foure or fiue times at the leaste with me, to be a witnesse againste him therein, and if I woulde affirme when néede shoulde stande, that I hearde him speake the wordes, he woulde giue me a greate summe of money, and saide moreouer, that after his death, he hoped to haue great part of his liuing, whereof, some lay very nigh to his house (but I hope he shall haue as muche good of it, as <hi>Iesabel</hi> had of <hi>Nabothes</hi> Uineyard.) And he promised me al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so, that if he fared wel, that I shoulde fare neuer the worsse.
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:9438:48"/>
But I liked his fare so wel, that I said his fare was too <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ne for me to féede on: and so by no meanes I would consent to his most wicked purpose, saying moreouer to him at my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting, take héede, for you thinke this is the verye waye to winne, but beléeue me, beléeue me, it is the very high waye to loose. If he loose his short life here guiltlesse, then he shall find his life in heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> endlesse. And though by his death you seme to liue the richer here: yet by this your wicked life, you shal procure your eternall death in Hel, where you shal ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer sée God, nor shunne the Deuil. And then he wente very sorrowfully from me, more (as it séemes by the sequele) for that he could not procure me to his purpose, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that he was sorie for his sinne. Then sayde the Iudge, I feare this fume is not without fire, it smels somewhat of the smoake: what say you that are his accuser to this? then said the accuser, O my Lord, this man that is the traytour, hath procured this man with money to saue himselfe by slaundring of me. Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider this man speakes on the behalfe of a Traytour, and I speake on the behalfe of a King. Is the King (sayde the Iudge) so desirous of his subiectes wrongfull death, as hée would haue none to tell truth in y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> defence of their life? We do the King no wrong to trie out the trueth, and to saue an innocent: neither do we the King right, if we heare not true witnesses against a Traitour, and iudge him according to the lawe: but assure thy selfe, that thy naming of the King, (whom I reuere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce) shal neither let vs from doing of right, nor yet constraine vs to do any wrong. We haue a heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly King here present, though our earthly King be absente, whom I honor, feare, and reuerence, more than I maye or ought my earthly soueraigne: for he is mortall, and can kill but the body, nor that neither, vnlesse God giue him leaue: but God our heauenly King that is here present, can kill at his pleasure both body and soule for euer in Hel fire. Well sir (said the accuser) I haue two witnesses to affirm my tale, and he hath but one to speake on his side: and yet that that he hath spoken, is nothing with him if it be well considered,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:9438:48"/>
for he doth not saye, that he that we accuse did neuer speake such words of treaso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but he hath inuented a friuolous mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, only to discredit me. Therfore I beséech you (oh worthy Iudge) to consider, that the traytour neyther hath said, nor can say any thing for himselfe, nor this fellow (hyred by him as it séemes) hath saide any thing to the purpose. Then the man that was accused said to the Iudge: oh my Lord consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> truth &amp; the innoce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts cause: as I stand here before God &amp; you, so I wil not lye neither to God nor you, the truth is, when I was presented to come before you, I knew not the cause thereof, whiche being true, as God knowes y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> is here prese<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, the time is very short, as your Lordship &amp; al the rest here may veri wel iudge, to premeditate, procure, or practise any such pollicy. And as for this ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> lord I am sure hath se<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t on my side, I neuer saw him, or spake with him in all my life to my remembraunce. Therfore my Lord, think that I am here as guiltlesse <hi>Susan,</hi> and this man God hathe raised vp instead of <hi>Daniel,</hi> which I doubt not at length, but wil be able to counteruaile againste these two false witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, that are in stead of two wicked Iudges. And GOD that is here my perpetual patrone, is sufficient and able to counteruaile this my wicked accuser. And then as soone as this honest accused man had said these words to the Iudge, an other straunge manne came in hastilye, and preaced ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye muche to speake to the Iudge, and saide: oh my Lord, I feare that here are thrée Wolues determined to deuoure a simple and innocent Lamb. How knowest thou that, said the Iudge? truly then said the man, I was going euen now within this houre thrée or four miles from home about cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine vrgent busines, and as I was going, I met by chance, (nay rather by Gods prouidence) with one that asked me if I knew suche a man, to whome I answered and said that I knew him not, but I haue hearde a good report of him, to bée both honest, godly, &amp; charitable.

saide I: and then he declared vnto me, the words of treason that he should speake, &amp; named this man (that stands here) to be his accuser therein, which when I hearde, hearing so much good of the man accused, and knowing so much euil of the accuser, I cut off my néedeful iorney, &amp; came hither with great spéede, to tel a truth, and to saue an innocent, if by any meanes I may. Then saide the Iudge to him, thinkest thou that this man that is accused of treason, is guiltlesse therin? Yea that I do, said the fellow, or else this his accuser wold neuer haue hyred me to beare false witnesse againste him therin. Is this true that thou sayst, saide the Iudge: yea my Lorde that it is (saide the fellowe) he cannot well denye it, for I am sure halfe a dozen times at the leaste, he was very importunate on me to beare witnesse againste hym in thus same matter that he hathe accused him of, and offered mée mony therefore largely: and vnderstanding partly my néed, he thought I coulde no more refuse his mony, than he could resist the Diuel when he moued him to mischiefe. For if I would haue consented to him herein, this good man had not bin so long vnaccused as he is: therfore I beséeche your lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shippe to consider wel of it, for I am neither desired, hyred, brybed, nor procured to come hither nowe, to speake this that I haue saide. Tel me truelye, saide the Iudge, doest thou knowe the man that is accused? no sir (said the fellow) I neuer sawe him in al my lyfe that I wote of, but I haue hearde of his good name, and honest fame: but I knowe his accuser very wel, for he offered me money to be a false wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse against him half a dozen times at the least, as I sayde before. Did not I tel you saide the Iudge, that after thys fume fire woulde followe? and then the accused knéeled downe vpon his knées with wéeping teares, saying: O Lord nowe I perceiue thou hast heard my prayer and performed my petitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: in stead of my accusers, two false witnesses, thou hast sent me two true witnesses, by which two witnesses (&amp; al throughe thée) my truth shall be tryed, and their falsenesse shall be founde. And then the Iudge saide to the accuser,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:9438:49"/>
how say you to this sirra? here are two witnesses stirred vp by God, against your two witnesses, procured by the Diuel:<note place="margin">Marke the Iudge.</note> I perceiue thou lokedst for nothing lesse, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that these two shold haue come hither to declare the truth as they do. Wel, it is the Lorde our God that hath sent them, and none else. What canst thou say to this? Then said the accuser, oh my Lord, both these are hyred for mony, for the deliuery of this Traytour, and for my destruction. A vaine excuse (saide the Iudge) for this ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hath protested before God that he knew not the cause he was sente for, when I did sende for him. Whiche if it be so, it is verye vnlikely, that since I layde the matter to his charge, he should procure this practise, and finde suche friends that he neuer knewe before, in so short a time, especially séeing he neuer spake nor once whispered to any since his comming hyther: but séeing (saide the Iudge) the trueth of euerye matter oughte to be tryed by the oths of the informers or witnesses, therefore I will haue euery one of you in this case deposed. And first, wil you two that came of your owne motion, or rather by God procured, (as I thinke) sweare nowe before the Lorde, without malice, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, enuie, spite, hatred, or without anye other sinister meanes, onelye for truthes sake, that this accuser of thys man of high treason againste the King, woulde haue hyred you for money, to be false witnesses against this accused ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in this same case whereof he nowe is accused? Then sayde the same two men to the Iudge, yea my Lorde, that we wil with all our heartes: for as the Lorde knowes the secretes of all our heartes, we haue saide nothing, nor will saye a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing, but onely the trueth. Then saide the Iudge to them, nowe take youre othes thereof: and so they were deposed and sworne, &amp; then the Iudge bidde them stand aside, and commaunded the accuser and his two witnesses to take their othes afore him, that the accused man did speake such words of treason wherof they accused him. And as they wer taking their othes, the one of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> witnesses coulde not speake,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:9438:50"/>
for the Lord did make his tong to swell in his mouth, that it was horrible to sée. The other witnesse immediatelye fell downe before them stark lame, and the wicked accuser was then stroken blind. At which sodaine change and righteous stroke of God, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Iudge &amp; al the rest wer amazed. Then said the Iudge: oh wicked wretches, did not I warne you of this before? do you thinke that God that is all truth, wil wincke at wickednesse or fauour falshod? what say you now, is this ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> guilty in that wherof you haue acused him? why do you not speake? though one of your tongs is swoln by the right iudgement of God, yet I beléeue god hath reserued some of your tongs to vtter the truth, and to excuse this innocent lambe appointed to the slaughter. Then the false witnesse that was stroken lame, said to the Iudge, we haue worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deserued the wrathe of God, which now is iustlye fallen vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs: we might haue take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> héed before by your good admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions, profitable persuasions, &amp; witty warnings, but that we lacked the good grace of God. Therfore as one y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled by the great God (ruler of al things) I wil open vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to your Lordship al the whole truth. This good man that is accused, is moste falsely and vniustly accused: and this man whose tong is thus swoln in his head, as you sée, and I that am so sodainely become lame, for gréedinesse of mony giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto vs by this now wicked blind ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, haue acused this good ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; witnessed that he heard him speake such words of tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, wheras the Lord knowes, we neuer heard him speake anye such thing. And euen as this blinde wicked wretche didde entice with money and faire promises these two good men (but all in vaine) who haue helped to saue thys innocente: euen so he gaue vs money wyth manye fayre promises of greate rewardes to condemne moste vniustlye this innocente.

<pb n="93" facs="tcp:9438:50"/>
what sayest thou (thou wicked accuser) to this? whome God most righteously hath stricken blinde: are not thy diuelishe deuises come to a trim drift? Then the blind accuser knée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led downe vpon his knées and saide: I am worthy to dye, it is onely I, that for spite and malice, and hope of worlde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gaine, haue mused this mischiefe, and procured this pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise against this godly, vertuous, and innocent man. Then said the Iudge to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> innocent ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, giue God the praise, for it is he that hath wrought this wonder: then said the innoce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t man, knéeling vpon his knées: O Lord, I thanke thée, that thou hast not onely heard me, but also hast deliuered me, blessed be thy name for euer. Then the accuser and the two false witnesses, by the iudgement of the Iudge, were tyed in foure seuerall partes to foure strong horses, that is, ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther arme to a horse, and either leg to a horse: and then whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the horses were ierked, euery one of them was torne a sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and all their landes and goodes were sold and giuen to the reliefe of the poore.</p>

Haue not manye loste in one yeare at Dice so muche, as their friendes were getting all their whole life? Haue not many loste at Dice in a wéeke, that that woulde wel haue serued them a whole yeare? Howe many honorable and worshipfull houses haue bene so ouerthrowne by Diceplay, that they are vtterly vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne at this day, and perhappes some nowe begge theyr breade, whose auncestours haue hadde Lordly liuings, and vtterly consumed by Diceplay, and other vnthriftie games. Hathe not Diceplay driuen many a one to borrowe, that else had bin able to lende? Do not many lose so much at Dice in an houre, as they cannot get honestly and truelye in a whole Wéeke? Whosoeuer shall playe at Dice or at anye other game for money or other gaine, the best is, he can but win, and then one or other that he playeth withall, muste néedes lose. Then consider, God sayeth: <hi>thou shalt loue thy neygh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour as thy selfe:</hi> whyche, if I ought to doe, then I must not haue my neighbor to lose, to make my selfe to winne. For, his losing by that meanes, can not be my winning. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, thoughe I séeme to winne by his losse: yet I lose as wel as he. Loue biddeth me rather lose to make my bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther win: and Hate bids me win with my neighbors losse: therefore, if I loue my neighbour as my selfe, then I cannot win with his losse, thoughe I séeme to win: the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I must néeds lose if he lose. Thus it is proued, that he that doeth winne at play is a loser. And also he that winneth at Dice or at any other game (whereby any hath losse that playeth with hym)
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:9438:52"/>
léeseth the fauour of God, bicause he fauoureth not him (that hée playeth withall) as himselfe, and doth laughe wyth his losse: which shewes he doth rather loath tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> loue his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour. And further, he that winneth at Dice or at any other kind of game, loseth Time, a pretious treasure, not to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered againe, in which time, whiles he was doing of euil in playing, he shoulde haue vsed some godly exercise. Thus he that winneth at Dice, or at any other game, is a thréefold loser. Now, if they that thinke themselues winners, be such<note place="margin">They that win are three fold loosers.</note> great losers as I haue proued: then I count them more fon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der than fooles, that wil play at Dice or at any other game, where the loser is hurt or hindred thereby. Therefore, if the winners muste néedes make an accompt, that they are such great loosers: then the loosers by no meanes can proue they are winners. So that if these Diceplayers and other gréedie gamesters woulde be ruled by me, they should leaue Dice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>playing and such like (which are the games of the Diuell) and fal to perfect prayer, the exercise of the sonne of God. If Diceplayers and other vaine gamsters, did déepely discerne<note place="margin">The gaine of Diceplay and such like.</note> what gaine Dicing, Carding, and other couetous gaming do bring, they would shunne them as a Serpent, and detest them as the Diuel.

And so he went away in a great rage, giuing his friendly creditor strokes for siluer, euil for good, &amp; punishement for payment. And thys was al that he coulde get on him for that tyme. And then the manne that was thus hurte or beaten, as wel as he coulde, wente to the nexte Iudge or Ruler, to whome he declared all the whole cause, and howe he was vsed for asking of his money, whyche when the Ruler hearde, hée sente for the sayde Gentlemanne immediatelye, who came to him presentlye, for he durste doe none other, to whome he sayd with very great griefe: If Gentlemen, whose life oughte to be a Lanterne to lighten their inferiours, whose lowli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse ought to be a line to leade the lewder sorte, whose gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlenesse and goodnes ought to be a guide to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> baser degrées, and whose perfect kéeping of promises should be a patterne to the rest of the people, be moste lewd in their liuing, most currishe in conditions, moste false of their Faith, moste haughtie in theyr heartes, and most vnthankfull for bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fites: howe is it possible that the common or inferior sorte, shoulde be any other? for, as it is saide, such Soueraigne suche Subiecte: suche Superiour, suche inferior: such Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, suche Manne: suche Maistresse, suche Maide: such Schoolemaister, suche Scholier: suche Pastoure, suche Parishioner: and such Shéepehearde, suche Shéepe.

What? doe you thynke you haue a righteuus GOD in Heauen? a Uertuous King on the Earth? and a iuste Iudge here nyghe, that will reuenge thys facte, punishe offendours, and doe equitie and righte as well to the poore as the rich? as wel to the highe as the lowe, and as well to the meane as the mightie? Then the Gentleman saide to the Iudge: my LORDE, I neyther owe thys man anye money, neyther haue I beaten him, maymed him, or misused hym. To whom the Iudge aunsweared: can you make mée bée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>léeue that, as thoughe a Gentleman cannot lye, and as thoughe your wordes were here of suche credite, that the poore man should therby be driuen out of countenaunce? do you think that this poore man would aske you mony, if you oughte him none, especiallye being so liberall, patiente, and gentle as you are? Can you make me beléeue, that thys manne durste bée so bolde to saye you haue hurte or maymed him, if you did it not? he had bene very wel occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyed to Father such lyes on you. I am sure that he had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be at home about his businesse, than here, vnlesse neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie didde vrge him thereto. You knowe that we execute Iustice equally &amp; iustly, respecting no persons: he may well knowe, that if wée punishe riche and mightie offendours, wée wyll not suffer the poorer malefactoures to escape vncorrected. And where you saye that you owe him no mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, here is your hande (whiche I knowe verye well) at
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:9438:56"/>
his debt booke. And therin you haue offended the law for ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which (assure your selfe) shall be executed on you. You that wil deny such a manifest thing, you wil not stick to lye in a secret thing. You that are wealthy haue aucthoritye to lye belike, but the children of God haue aucthoritye onely to saye true. And wheras you haue saide before me, that you haue neither hurt, maimed, nor misused him, if beating and mayming, be well vsing of a man, then you haue vsed hym wel. But if it be proued that you haue hurt or maimed him, then you haue made another lye, the penalty of both which lyes you shall surely pay. Then saide the Iudge to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> may<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, hast thou any witnesses here that he thus did beate thée and mayme thée? yea (my Lorde) saide the man, I haue thrée witnesses here readie to be deposed therof, which thrée the Iudge deposed, and they affirmed the same. Then the Iudge said, haue you not vsed this honest man that was so good vnto you, more like a foe tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a friend? truly it gréeues me that suche a one as you should be called by the name of a Gentleman: you haue not only kept this pore ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s mony fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him a gret whyle, wherby he is much impouerished: but also you haue maymed him, whereby he is like to liue the worse. But it is no matter, you are like to paye for that: for though you know not the price of maiming, I wil tech you y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> price of mayming. Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sider, the wares that you had of this ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> were his, &amp; not yours: but it séemes that you haue made the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> yours, &amp; not his: but if they were his as you cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, &amp; if you wil not pay him for them, as you vtterly refuse, then you meane to deteine them by force, and to kéepe them as your own. Whiche, though you are loath<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I shoulde call robbery, yet I ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not say that you haue them iustly and tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, which signifyes as much as you haue them falsely. As you now hold the name of superioritie, so ought you to take<note place="margin">Considert his well.</note> héed you deserue not the contrarie. I know you abhorre the name of Théeuerie, then why haue you done that that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to such infamy? There are two kind of théeues, one that steales for necessitie, secretly, and fearefully, &amp; another
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:9438:56"/>
that steale néedelesse, openly, and boldly: truly I thinke that these seconde kinde of théeues that steale, néedelesse, open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and boldly, before God and good men, are a greate deale worse than the poore simple théeues that steale of necessitie, secretly and fearefully. Then the saide Gentleman (fearing leaste his offence shoulde be reuealed to the King if he stoode any further in it, knowyng also that bothe the lawe in this case was very straight, and that the Iudge was so iust, that nothing could make him halte from doyng equitie and Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice,) when he heard the Iudge say so, he began to relent, &amp; sayd: I am sory my Lord that I haue misused this man as I haue done. Then the Iudge sayd, I praye God your sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row may be suche, that therefore you may mourne in your minde. But if I had béen suche a one as woulde haue béene flattered with faire wordes, haue béene procured wyth plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saunte promises, and woulde priuilye haue taken gentle re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes (more rightlye called Bribes,) I feare that then this your sodaine sadnesse would haue béen turned into ioye and gladnesse. Then the Gentleman sayd, no my Lorde, I beséech you take it not so. And then with that came in one that was a very friend of the said Gentlemans, and thought hée myghte doe muche with the Iudge, séeming by hys at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyre, to bée of a great countenaunce and credite, who prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to speake with the Iudge priuilye: to whome the Iudge sayde: Awaye, I will talke with none secretely, vntill this matter bée ended and iudged: Yes good my Lorde (sayd the suter,) it is for no harme: Then you may tell it openlye (sayde the Iudge) if it bée for good: the matter (sayde the suter) is suche, that it may not bée tolde openlye. Wyll you (sayde the Iudge) promise me by your credite and fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, that it toucheth nothing this matter nowe dependyng before me, and that it requireth such spéede, that my hearing<note place="margin">Marke this well.</note> of it maye not be delayed: Bée well aduised what you doe, for I assure you, if you shall lye vnto mée, you shall haue the law executed on you, according to the lie you tell. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the suter stayed and sayde nothyng. To whome the

Iudge sayd, is it not strange that he is now become dumbe, that euen now was so desirous to speake? If youre matter appertayne not to this, I will heare you priuilye: if you haue oughte to saye in this your Friends cause, speake it openlye. At whyche woordes hée would saye nothyng. To whome the Iudge sayde then, I muste néedes nowe thynke that you meante to offer mée a bribe secretely, which you were afrayde to giue openlye: and therefore nowe by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause you are like to incurre a mischief whether you speake a lye priuilye, or the trueth openlye, (for that you sée I am not bente to shoote in youre Bowe,) therefore wiselye (as you thinke) you holde your peace. But euery wise manne maye consider, youre sodayne silence doeth shewe youre naughtie and subtile sute. And if you will haue me and all the rest here to thinke the better of you, vtter here openlye what you woulde haue spoken so priuily to mée. Then the Suter sayde, Good my Lorde iudge better of mée, for my meanyng was not so euill as you make it. Then tell oute your tale, that I maye take it better. Forsooth my Lorde (sayd the Suter) my wordes to you in secrete should onelye haue bene to desire you to be good vnto this Lord my friend. Then sayde the Iudge, was not that as muche to saye, as to be euill to this poore manne, that he misused as hys foe? Forsoothe a preatie sute: as thoughe thys poore manne had not wrong ynoughe, but I that onelye am appoynted by GOD and my kyng to doe hym righte, shoulde for your sake doe hym more wrong: but truelye, if these were the woordes that you meante to speake to mée, it had béene better, both for my credite (if I would haue béene allured) and for your honestie, (if you had meante to seduce mée) to haue spoken these woordes openlye, rather than secretelye: for the secrete talke betwéene vs among all thys company, mighte haue bredde a suspition, where none was: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the open telling thereof, coulde neuer haue done it.

and tell him like wise, that for his friedlinesse, I will showe him what friendshippe or pleasure I can doe in al the world. Of whiche gentle aunswere of the Iudge, the fellowe was glad and so went for his Maister. Which letter the Iudge put into his bosome, and woulde not open it. And the Iudge paused a while vntil the Gentleman came that sent him the letter, and then immediately in came the Gentleman bothe pleasantly and merily that sent him the letter, saying<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I am here my Lord, according to your commaundement; you are come in good time (said the Iudge:) you are he that I looked for: I thanke you for your louing letter.

Which when the Gentleman hearde, he began to mislike the matter, and wished the letter in his handes againe: but bicause he thought that would not be, he meant to make the best shifte he could, saying to the Iudge, I beséeche youre honoure to peruse my letter when it please you, and then if it please your honour to send for me, I wil come to you at your commaundement: therefore I craue at this time to be gone, for I haue verye greate businesse: then the Iudge sayde to him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> séeyng you haue giuen me leysure to reade your letter, I will giue you leysure to tary here whiles I haue read the same.

               <p>That is true, but me thinkes theyr Lawyers, before they haue spente the fourth parte of so much money, might perfectly knowe whether theyr Clientes cause were right or wrong, which knowne, they should perswade theyr Clients to procéede no further.</p>

Then said y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> surgeon, you must giue me some mony to buy milder

medicines, for the house allowes me none other than these: to whome the pore patient sayde, I hardly beléeue y<hi rend="sup">•</hi>, for the chiefe Rulers of the house are so godly, that they will allow rather suche things as you thinke méete which haue know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, than suche as they thinke méete that haue no know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.

Well, all riche men are not learned, nor all poore men are not vnlearned. The state I am nowe in, is far vnlike to my education. God doth all thinges for the beste to them that he loueth, therefore I thank him most hartily for this change. Then said the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon, your messenger tarries very long, whereby I thinke he brings no money with him.

The Lorde forbid said he: I hope I can haue no worse chaunge at your handes, than I haue had: and presently the messenger came, saying: I haue spoken with your mother, who hath no mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney nowe to sende you, but she saith you shal haue it to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe without faile. Then saide the Surgeon, I will tell you more to morrow, for when I haue money, then you shal<note place="margin">No money no case.</note> haue ease, for I cannot buy things with nothing. Then said the patient, I beséeche you take some pitie of me: you know my minde, saide the Surgeon, remember me, and I will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member you. Then saide the poore wounded fellowe, séeing money will ease me I will goe my selfe and fetch you mony: you shal be sure to haue it before my next dressing: then said the Surgeon, bring me the money, and you shall finde me ready to shewe you what pleasure I can. Then the fellowe (vnderstanding, that the Iudge and Ruler of the Citie was a godly, vertuous, and an vpright Iudge, who vtterly ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horred such diuelish dealers as the Surgeon was) went im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately vnto the Iudge, and complained of the Surgeon, telling him in all pointes how the Surgeon had vsed him: to
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:9438:69"/>
whome the Iudge sayde, sée that you tell me nothing but trueth, and if this fall out according as you haue told me, I wil make him an example to all Surgeons that shall come after him. Yea, it is too true, saide the pore man, I haue wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of it if néede be: then the saide Iudge commanded, that the saide Surgeon should be brought before him immediat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and two or thrée other cunning Surgeo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s besids, to iudge therein: and when the Surgeon came before the Iudge, and saw his pore impatient there, his countenaunce maruelou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sly changed. Sirra, said the Iudge to him, are you a Stipen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>darie Surgeon appointed to such an Hospital? yea my Lord, saide the Surgeon: Knowe you this fellowe héere with the sore arme, said the Iudge? I knowe him well, saide the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon. And I feare he knoweth you too wel, saide the Iudge. Were not you appointed to be his Surgeon for the curing of his wound? yes truely, said the Surgeon, and I truste I haue vsed him as an honest man ought to doe. Your counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance and color said the Iudge, is as good as two witnesses, that you haue rather misused him. How long is it since you tooke him in hand? forsooth, said the Surgeon, a moneth, and something more. Then the Iudge commaunded the other Surgeons to looke vppon the saide poore mans sore arme, whiche, when they sawe, they saide to the Surgeon that had it in cure, this is a great sore, &amp; wil not easily be cured: was it a gréene wounde or an olde sore, when they tooke it in ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d at the firste? for sooth it was a gréene wounde, said the poore mans Surgeon, but it was in an euil case, bycause he came no sooner to me than he did. Take héede thou lye not said the Iudge, for I wil assure thée, for euery lye thou tellest before me here, I will make thée paye full dearely: then saide the poore wounded man, I coulde not well come sooner to you, nor to any other, for you were appointed to be my Surge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and to cure me within two houres after I was wouu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. Did not I (saide the Iudge) bidde you beware of lying: I hold you a wager, your lye wil neither gain you lease nor lande. Then saide the Surgeons, alas poore fellowe,
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:9438:69"/>
thou haste not bin wel vsed, for being a gréene wounde, the worst of vs thrée would haue taken vpon vs by Gods grace (if thou hadst come to vs a day after thou camste to this sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon) to haue wholly and perfectly healed this wound, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in this place, within thrée wéekes at the furthest. Howe long hathe this man had you in hande, sayde they? Forsooth a moneth and odde dayes, &amp; now I am a great deale worse than I was at the firste: and what paines he hath put me to euer since, bothe nighte and day, it would lament you if you knewe it. Wée beléeue thée, said the Surgeons. Then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like (said the Iudge) he hathe giuen him some corrosiues to putte him to paine, and kepe him longer from healing, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to get some money of him, or else to trye some maiste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and practises vppon him, or rather both. Truly, said the Surgeons, it is not vnlike, for, if he had vsed him orderlye, honestly, and according to our Arte, he might haue put him to small paine, and healed him perfectlye before this tyme. Then the pore wounded man saide, I knowe not howe he practised with me, but euer when he dressed me, most com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly morning &amp; euening, I was in such extreme paines, and intollerable torments, for eight or nine houres after at the least, that I had bin almost as good to haue sit in the fire sauing for burning my body and bones: The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> said the Iudge to the wicked Surgeon: Oh cruell cut-throat, O tyrannous<note place="margin">Note the Iudges wordes.</note> tormentor, and séede of Sathan: hadst thou none to proue these paineful practises on, but on this thy Christian bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? For he is thine owne brother, if thou euer meane to haue God to be thy father: surely an honest heart, or a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful minde, woulde neuer haue tryed suche painefull pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctises on a Turke or a Iewe, nay scantly on a Dogge if he loued hym, muche lesse on thy brother, whome thou arte bounde to loue as thy selfe. My Lorde, saide the pore man, it séemeth he put me to these great paines to get some mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney of mée<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for hée saide to me, that if I woulde gyue him some money, hée woulde vse mée easely and gentlye,
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:9438:70"/>
and vpon that, I sente this messenger that is héere, to my mother for a noble to giue him (which was his request) was it so saide the Iudge to the messenger? Yea in déede sayde the messenger: but when the Surgeon sawe that I came a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine without money, he was very angry, as it séemed: and this poore man moste pitifully desired hym to be good vnto hym, and to let him haue some ease, but hée answeared hym churlishely, and saide, when I haue money then you shall haue ease. Indéed my Lord said the pore wounded man, these were his very wordes, and he telleth nothing but the truth, What was the cause, (said the Iudge) wherefore he woulde haue a Noble of thée? Forsoothe, saide the poore man, he fay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to me, that y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> house did allow him none other medicines than suche as he dressed me withall: therfore you must giue me mony (said he) to buy more milder medicines. As thogh, saide the Iudge, the house allowed no salues, but suche as woulde putte pore men to paine, and kéepe them long from healing. Come hither sit Surgeon, saide the Iudge, howe like you this geare? what can you saye for youre selfe? To whom the Surgeon saide nothing, but hanged downe hys head, and was ashamed. Then said the thrée Surgeons, sure ly my Lord, if he said so, he hath shamefully s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

I knowe it is so, sayde the Iudge, or else these houses might more worthily be na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med tormentors of men than helpers of men. And then hée spake to the pitilesse Surgeon, saying, what horrible hearte haddest thou, to tormente this poore fellowe, and to be quiet thy selfe? howe couldst thou craue money of hym that had none, whiche was more méete to aske thée whiche hadde some?

Then sayd the Iudge, I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitte the curing of this pore man into one of youre hands, that belongs to that Hospital where this poore manne is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to be sut coured and helped. Then one of them sayde to the Iudge (that was a stipendarie Surgeon of that house) I wil be content to do my dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce to him, as much as I am able. Then sayde the Iudge to him: I néede not bydde you vse him wel, for here is one (mening the cruel Surged) ere it be long, will teache you how to vse him, and also hée wil be a sufficient warning to al other Surgeons hereafter, to helpe their patients, as quietly, as orderly, and as spéedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as they may. And bycause (sayd the Iudge to the wye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked Surgeon) thou wouldst haue had a noble of hym to sette<note place="margin">A good iudge ment.</note> him out of paine into ease. I Iudge now, that thou shalte giue him foure nobles, bicause thou didst put him out of ease into paine. Saying further to him, aunsweare me to one thing that I shall aske thée, what is that shorte sentence of Christe, that the King commaundes so straightlye to bée kept? to whom the Surgeon aunsweared, <hi>Whatsoeuer you woulde that men shoulde doe to you euen so doe yee to them.</hi> Then said the Iudge, thou hast said wet, &amp; better than thou hast done. Haste thou of thy conscience done to thys pore man, as thou wouldst haue bin done vnto, if thou hadst bene in the like case? No truely saide the Surgeon: if thou haddest saide otherwise (saide the Iudge) euery one here woulde haue thoughte thou hadst lyed. And nowe bycause thou hast done vnto this man, as thou wouldst not be done vnto, therefore thou shalte be done vnto as thou haste done vnto him. So that I doe here openly Iudge, that the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner shall giue thée suche a wound on thy arme, and in the like place, as this poore man hadde at the firste. And I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mande you that are the other two Surgeons here, to dresse him euerye Euening and Morning with suche pintchyng plaisters, and extreame corrosiues, that he may bée in cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell tormentes and paines eight or nyne houres after euerye
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:9438:71"/>
dressing, and continue thus with him a month at the least: mary haue respect in the meane season, throughe your good knowledge and discreations, to vse the wounde in such or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that after it may be perfectly and wel cured: and he shal be at the onely costes and charges for the curing of it. And if he be not then able to doe it, you shal be allowed therfore out of the Hospitall of this Citie, where this pore man suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cored, helped and reléeued, not thinking they shal be much troubled againe to paye for the cures. And also I iudge, bycause he did make a manifest lye before my face, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> he shal not speake of thrée moneths after he is perfectly healed, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse throughe some vrgent matter he be called or willed to speake before any Magistrate, Ruler, or Iudge, and all that whyle he shall weare on his sléeue, an H. and L. whyche sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies a Hurtful Lyar. And this is my full and determined iudgement in no wise to be reuoked: and bycause I woulde haue my iudgement herein the more straightly done, I wil my selfe sée the wounde made in his arme: therefore let the executioner come hither with spéed. And when the executio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner was come, the Iudge forthwith commaunded him, to make a wound according to his iudgement in the said sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons arme: and then he committed him to the other twoo surgeons, to be vsed and ordered in all pointes according as he before had iudged.</p>

               <p>This is such a hedge, that a Théese cannot well leape ouer.

It fullye, as it were with one stroke, suppresseth all forgerye of euidences and writing. For, who wyil forge anye wry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings vnlesse they maye sucke some gaine thereby? what doe wrytings preuayle if they be not lawefull? they maye counterfayte them if they liste, but they cannot confirme them if they woulde.

if we had this law, and well executed, the Usurers durst not trust to their starting holes as they doe: this law woulde so lincke them, that some might be so madde to lende, yet who woulde be so mad to borrow? and though the Usurer muste néedes lament his losse, yet the borrower could not laugh at his winning: the lender woulde bée so afrayde, that the bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed<note place="margin">Note well.</note> would bewray him: and the borrower would be so a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraide, that the lender would bewray him: and both the len<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and the borrower woulde be so afrayde, that they that were priuie to it, would bewray them: and they that were priuie to it, woulde be so afraide, that one or other woulde bewraye them, that surely in my iudgement there woulde not one Usurer be founde in all oure Countrey within one moneth: and then I hope, wée shoulde haue some lend their money for nothing, though none nowe almost wyl lende but for somthing.

I digresse, for you say the breaking of the law, will make vs be punished in Hell: then I am sure that euery one shall be punished in Hell. For euery one from the beginning of the world (except Christ) hath broken the lawe: and though a man may fulfill one of the tenne commaundements, which in all points is very harde for him to doe, yet it is impossible for any to kéepe and fulfil them all. Which law I may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare to a Ladder of tenne steppes, whereof, though one goe vp nine of them perfectly and well, yet if the tenth burst or breake, or if he fal from the tenth, he is neuer a whit the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for going vp the nine steppes, and so he hath such a fall, that he is neuer like to reach to the top, vnlesse hée haue ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and a surer Ladder to clime by, than he had before.</p>

               <p>You haue sayd very well, and applyed the thing very aptly: but I meant not that euery one that breakes the law should go vnto Hell, nor euery one that sayes they can kéepe the lawe, shall goe to Heauen. <hi>Adam</hi> at firste dydde breake the lawe for vs all, and brought in death: Christ did after fulfill the lawe for vs all, and brought in lyfe. Since which time that <hi>Adam</hi> did breake the law, we that came of him were neuer able to kéep the law: yet for al that whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer he be that beléeues in Christ, that is sory for his sinnes, &amp; hartily repents the same, earnestly desiring God to forgiue him for Christes sake, and is assured that Christ will rayse him vp at the last day, and that through his birth, life, passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, death, resurrection, and ascension, hée is made a member of Christ, euen hée I say, thoughe he haue broken the lawe, shal be saued &amp; not be punished in Hel fire: for Christs per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming of the lawe shall auaile him as much, as if hée had kepte the lawe himselfe. And thus though the members of Christ breake the law, Christ their head for them hath per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed the law. Therfore you mistooke me, for I meant the breakers of the lawe that were not the members of Christ, shoulde bée punyshed in Hell: it is thys oure Christ that is the sure Ladder whereby wée muste clime vp to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen.

Of whom he enquired the way to his frinds house, and then he saide to the traueller, if you kéepe the way still on the right hand, it wil bring you straight to his house, but in any wise take héede that you followe not the waye on the lefte hande, for if you doe, it will leade you into Woods and Thickets, where you will be in very greate daunger to be deuoured of wilde beastes: but when the man was gone, the trauellour giuing lyttle credite or none to hym that tolde hym the way, and pleased more with the fayre beaten path on the left hand, than with the small troden way on the right hand, and therewith all béeyng more wilfull than wise, more rash than reasonable, and more carelesse than carefull, tooke the way on the left hande: which he folowed so far, that or euer he was aware, he was among the wild beasts, who presently deuoured him. And thus, through mistrusting of him whiche knewe the way, and trusting to himselfe that knew not the way, he sought his own sorrow, and in stead of his good cheare and commodities whiche he should haue had with his friend, he made the wilde beastes good cheare with his owne bodye, and so for a liking life, he gotte a terrible death.</p>

               <p>There was a certaine good and charitable man did ride homewarde to his house, who chaunced to heare one make pitifull groaning, and then hée drewe nearer and nearer to the noise, and thereby at the laste came to the place where he sawe the same pitifull person, saying to him, alacke my friende, what aylest thou? Oh sir, said the man, as I tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelled this way, beyng in perfect health, I sodainly fel sicke,
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:9438:81"/>
I was constrained to lay my selfe downe in this place: and nowe what with the great cold I haue taken here, and what with my sodain and extreame sicknesse, I thinke I shal dye, and that within a while, vnlesse some good &amp; charitable man do reléeue and succour me. And to tel the truth. I haue neuer a peny in al the world, and if I had, my heart is so fainte, my body so sicke, and my legges so weake, that I am not able to go from this place to succour my self. Which when the pore sicke man had spoken, the good and charitable man wept for the griefe of this his pore brother, saying, good brother bée of good comforte, God hath commaunded vs, that we must loue our neighboure as our selfe, and you are one of my worldly neighbours, though I know not where you dwell, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I muste do for you as I woulde do for my selfe. Christe wils vs, <hi>Whatsoeuer you would that other should do to you euen so do you to them.</hi> Now, if I were in youre case, &amp; you in mine, I would be glad that you should help me: euen so I must be willing to ayd &amp; help you now. And so doing. I do as I wold be done vnto, &amp; therefore brother help thy self now as as much thou may, &amp; I wil put to my strength as much as I can, and whereas my horsse is too slender to beare vs bothe, thou shalt ride &amp; I wil holde thée and go by thée on foote. To whom the sicke man said, the Lord rewarde you, whereas I am vnable: &amp; so with much ado, the sicke man was set on hys horsse, &amp; at the last he brought him home to his house, where he looked to him so louingly, cherished so charitably, &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted him so curteously, that he was verye well recouered within a while after. And when the saide sick man was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly and throughly hoale, and determined to goe away, the said good and charitable man saide to him, brother I thanke God that I was able to do this for thée: and for that you said to me when I sawe you first, that you had no money, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore here is a Riall to put in your purse, for so I woulde bée glad to be done vnto if I did lacke. And then the said fellow departed away, hauing good lucke to hap on such a friend.</p>

But nowe I will procéede with the same. Within a whyle after the saide poore man was gone, the said good &amp; charitable man
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:9438:82"/>
hauing occasion to ride aboute some bussnesse, in his riding his horse did stumble, wherby he was cast off from his horse into a little shallowe ditche, where there was no water, &amp; his horse fel vpon him, so that neither he, nor his horse could stirre: yet he lay quietly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and without striuing, in hope to be helped by the next person that shoulde come that waye: and as he looked vp a little<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he espiyd the pore man comming on foote thither warde, that he hadde done so muche for of late, whereof he was verye glad, and when he came something nighe him, he called him by his name, and saide, good brother helpe me, for I am not able to helpe my selfe, my horsse is fallen so vpon me, and in suche a place, that, neither I, nor he, are able to stirre. But this vnkinde wretche, knowing bothe the man and the horse well inoughe, saide vnto hym, and that churlishly: I haue to greate haste to tarrie now to helpe you, Then the same man saide to him againe: Ah my friend, I did not vse you thus. I care not for that saide hée, Doe you thinke that I haue nothing else to doe, but to tary here to helpe you? let them that come nexte after helpe you if they will<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and so the vile varlet went his way apace, and lefte his deare friend that had done so muche for him, in that daunger: then by and by came a straunger, whome he knew not, to whome, as soone as he called, he helped both him and his horse vp presently: the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they both rode a preity way togi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to whome this godly and charitable man shewed howe vnkindly the poore man had vsed him, and how much a little before he had done for him: then, saide he, it was the churli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shest parte that euer I hearde of before, and especiallye to suche a friend, as you were lately to him. Truely, if I were as you, saide he, I woulde reueale the whole matter thereof to the Iudge, who is suche a fauourer of Trueth, and hater of Uice: suche a defender of the Innocent, and suche a puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sher of the wicked: and suche a patrone to the pore, and such an enimy to the euill, that he will make that moste ingrate villaine, to bée a spectacle to all other that shall come after him.

And so presently these two men departed one from another, and immediately after, the man came home that helped the godly and charitable man that was fallen vnder his horse, not forgetting the maruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous churlishnesse and ingratitude of the fellowe that would not helpe him a little, that had done so muche for him, went to the Iudge and tolde him all the whole matter: to whome the Iudge saide, me thinkes this tale you tell, is not like to be true. For, I beléeue there is not suche an ingrate per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son on the earth. Take héed my friend you do not faine this of enuie and spite, onely to hurte the poore fellowe withall. My Lord said the man, I know not that fellow for I neuer sawe him in all my life that I remember, neither euer didde heare of his name, before the honest and charitable man told me whome he so misused. Wel, saide the Iudge, if it be true, such an vnthankefull wretche is not worthie to liue: and then the Iudge commanded one of his officers to bring that vnthankefull fellowe vnto him in all the haste possible, and also sent for the honest and charitable man to come béefore him, and when they were come, the Iudge said to the honest and charitable man: Doe you know this fellow? Yea my Lorde, I knowe him, saide he: By what occasion were you acquainted with him, saide the Iudge, tell truth, and looke that you doe not fable with me in any wise. Well, saide hée, séeing youre Lordship commaundes me, I will doe it, which otherwise I woulde be loath to doe. As I rode by the way, not very long since, I heard one grone pitifully, by the sound whereof I came to the place where this fellowe didde lye on the grounde both extreame colde, and verye sicke, whome I carryed home to my house, and there wyth suche as
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:9438:83"/>
I had, I did nourishe and cherishe him, and by Gods helpe gote him hys former strength againe. And this is the very occasion that I was acquainted wyth hym. Then sayde the Iudge, euery one findeth not such a commoditie at their first acquaintaunce as he did. Howe sayste thou, said the Iudge to the poore fellowe, is this true? Yea my Lorde I can not deny it: thou haddest better lucke, saide the Iudge, than<note place="margin">It is true.</note> many an honester man than thou hathe. But haddest thou neuer occasion to shewe hym anye fryendshippe or pleasure since that time? No my Lord, sayd the fellowe. Take héede, saide the Iudge, that you lye not, for if you make a lye be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore me, I will make you that you shall neither lye nor tell trueth of a good while after. Then the Iudge sayde to the godly man that was so friendly to him: tell mée whether it lay in his power since to haue shewed you pleasure or not. Then he saide, indéede my Lorde, it laye once in his power since to haue done me pleasure: to whome the Iudge sayde, then there is no doubte but he did it. Why do you not tel me, did he it or not? then he saide to the Iudge, as I could be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tente not to vtter the trueth, euen so I am loath to tel youre Lordshippe a lye. Truely he did it not. Then said the Iudge to the fellow: How sayst thou to this? then the fellow sayd, truely (my Lord) as I went hastily by the way, vpon great and waightie businesse, I sawe one lye vnder his Horsse in a little shallow place, but I did not knowe that this manne was he. Then saide the Iudge, Diddest thou neuer speake with this man since that time? No forsooth my Lorde, sayde he: to whome the Iudge aunsweared: Howe dos<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

This felowe (saide the Iudge) hath vttered the trueth againste his will, thoughe he woulde lye, hys tongue will not lye. And then the Iudge said to the godly manne: What aunswere made he you when you cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued his helpe? truly (my Lord) I haue too great hast to tarry

Let the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that come after helpe you if they wil, and so churlishly he departed. And if this good man, a méere stranger to me, had not come by, as God woulde, and hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped me, I knowe not to what extreamitie I hadde béene driuen. Then saide the Iudge, this man hath done good two manner of wayes: the one is, which was duetye in helping you vppe, being fallen vnder your horse: the other is, in vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering to me the intollerable ingratitude of this pestiferous person: come neare to me, saide the Iudge to the fellowe: Suppose this good man in that distresse had bene vnknowen<note place="margin">Note this.</note> and a straunger to thée, as it is most sure thou didst knowe him, as appeareth both by thy answere then made vnto him and by thine owne wordes vttered here before vs all: yet is that a sufficient excuse, that therfore thou shouldest not help him in his necessitie, or saue his life? this good and charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble man that founde thée almost dead, was a méere straun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to thée, and neuer knewe thée before: and wouldst thou haue thought it a good and sufficient aunswere, and bin well pleased withall, if he shoulde then haue saide vnto thée, I am but a stranger to thée, and knowe thée not, and therfore lette some of thy kinred, friendes, or other that knowe thée, help, succour, and reléeue thée, I haue other businesse with my mo ney, than to bestowe it vpon thée? Howe saist thou? woulde this aunsweare haue pleased thée or not? but the fellowe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered neuer a worde. Then saide the Iudge, thou doest well to holde thy peace, for else, eyther thou muste incurre the danger of lying, or condemne thy self by saying of truth: thou varlet, pitty would haue compelled anye body that had<note place="margin">Marke the Iudges words.</note> altogither a stony hart, to haue stayed so long to help a shéep or a beast, but much more his Christan brother, but most of al, suche a friend, that so lately had saued his life. Couldest thou suffer him to perish, that lately, did preserue thée? coul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest thou suffer him to lye in daunger, that so louingly didde

rydde thée out of daunger? couldest thou, to spare thy shorte labor without one peny expence, suffer hym to die, that both with the labour of hys body, the care of his minde, and the spending of his substaunce, did make thée to liue? Consider the dumbe Dogge, whose kindenesse is suche to his friend and Maister, that no gifte can procure hym, no meate can moue him, nor no way can winne him, to forsake his friende or Maister, no thoughe he beate hym: and shall wée then, that are reasonable creatures, the Image of God, the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Christe, the children of GOD, and the brethren of Christ, flye from our friendes, whome oure finger maye helpe, that with body and goodes did defend vs from death<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>? shall wée make our selues worse than Dogges, that GOD doeth preferre before the Aungels? haue not some Dogges loued their friendes and Maisters so well, that they haue leapt into great waters, rather endaungering themselues to be drowned, to followe their friendes and Maisters, than to tary behind them with the safegard of their liues? Some Dogges haue had suche a feruent loue to their friende and Maister, that after their death, they haue neuer eaten any meate, and so haue dyed for sorrowe. Some also haue scraped vp the earth where their maisters were buried, and so haue buryed themselues in their Maysters graues: and what saye you to that Dogge that loued his friend and Maister so alyue, that burned hymselfe to death on hote coales, when his Maister was dead. Nowe, if these dumbe Dogges, brute beastes, and vnreasonable creatures, that knowe not howe a good tourne should bée recompenced, that knowe not a méete rewarde for a bountifull benefite, nor what fauoure is fitte for a faythfull friende, are so lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing to their friend, will neuer shrinke from their friende, and manye tymes will dye with their friend: and wée that are reasonable creatures, that doe knowe all this, and are most false to our friendes, forgetfull of benefites, and chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishe to our cherishers, then I muste accompt these dumbe Dogges better than we, and we worse than Dogs.

mayest thou not be ashamed to bée prooued worse than a Dogge? Beholde, a little Birde shall make thée ashamed. But how canst thou be ashamed? for I thinke thou hast no shame at all.

And as wée haue no good and seuere lawe for the punishyng of this Uice, so a greate sorte with vs thinke, that Ingratitude is no offence or faulte. Well, we must not measure our faultes by their mindes: yet the Ingratitude betwéene man and manne, is almost nothyng in comparison of the ingratitude or vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindnesse of man towards God: for, if you marke the great benefits of God towards man on the one side, and the colde loue of Man, and his vnthankfulnesse to God on the other side, then you must néedes be constrayned to saye so. Didde not God make Man at the first to his owne image and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse? Did he not plante him in that pleasaunt place called Paradise? Didde hée not make Heauen and Earth, Fire, Ayre, and Water, Beastes, Birdes, and Fishes, and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thinges, onely for hym, before hée was created, bicause that he should haue all things as a King readye agaynst his comming? and what a part did he playe within a while af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter? God for bade him but one thing of all other, and yet he did it. Do you not thinke that this was a kinde and thanke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full man that woulde not doe one thing at Gods requeste, that had done so many wonderfull things for him vnreque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted? and yet the performing of it was for his owne profite:
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:9438:86"/>
whereas the breaking of it was the vtter destructio of him, and all his posteritie. Yet consider the great goodnesse and mercye of God to man, for all that: for whereas man by no meanes could saue himselfe out of the Diuels danger, God without the knowledge of man, healed this helplesse harme, euen so maruelously and louinglye, as neuer the lyke was heard of. For God his déere and only sonne, of a mightie and eternal king in Heauen, became a poore and miserable man on Earth, and so suffered hunger, was as it were an abiect, was buffeted, mocked, scourged, crucified, and killed, and all to saue man, that before had lost himselfe: whose death dyd disappoint the Diuel of his purpose: for whosoeuer repents his sinnes earnestly, and beléeues that sinnes shall be forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen through Christes death assuredly out of all doubte, hée shal be reputed for no sinner, but shal be a me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber of Christe, and bée an inheritoure of the Kingdome of Heauen wyth Christ. Trauayle into what countrey you will, and reade all the Histories in the world, and yet you shall neuer heare of the like friendship to this. Yet how thankfull and louyng are the most of the inhabitants of the whole Earth, to God and to Christe his sonne, for this his benefite farre passing all other, that is, for bringing of vs from the Diuel to God, and from Hell to Heauen? let vs consider in oure consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences.</p>

The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> séeing Christe the eternall King of Heauen, came downe to thys prison of Earth, remayning here thirtie &amp; thrée yeares and more, and suffered death in his owne person moste vile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye on the Crosse, to saue all our lyues, that otherwayes had bene damned driuels, why doe we not most ioyfully clappe our hands at this King?

               <p>And as God doeth detest ingrate persons, so he doth fauour them that be thankful, as I will shew you by a rare example: There was an honest Gentlemen sodayn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly had his Thumbe striken off with the shotte of a Gunne,
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:9438:88"/>
whiche when he perceyued, straightway he knéeled downe and sayd, my Lord and God I thanke thée, for if thou of thy goodnesse hadst not preserued mée, I might as well haue bin killed with this shot, as to haue lost my thumbe with thys shot: therfore blessed be thy name, thou knowest better than I, what is méete for me, thou doest all things for the best to them that loue thée. And within a certaine tyme after, thys gentleman was taken prisoner, and was appointed to bée hanged the next daye after: and bicause they would make him sure for flying, he was manacled to one of his enimies, and (as God would) on the same hand that lackt the thumb. But in the night, perceyuing him that was manacled with him, to sléepe verye soundly, he pluckte his hande throughe the manacle, which he could neuer haue done, if hée had had hys thumbe. And so by such shift as he made, he escaped. And thus by Gods greate goodnesse, the losse of his thumbe was the sauing of his life.</p>

Well, lette them thinke what they will, none in oure Countrey thinke so, and the wise will thinke (whatsoeuer they thinke) that this lawe is not made to make any lose their lands or goods, but to make manye take héede that they doe not loose their landes and goodes. And thoughe some perhaps will thinke there is no cause why the pore childe shoulde haue halfe the landes and goodes of the riche man, the lawe that willeth it, is cause good ynough. Besides it is a greate reason, that the pore childe shoulde haue halfe the landes and goodes of the riche man that hathe done hym wrong, as the rich mans sonne to haue all the poore childes liuing, that neuer did him harme.</p>

               <p>Truely, I neuer hearde of the like before, I would to God that euery one of our rich men would bestow but part of their goods and landes in this order. Whiche, if they did they should neuer haue the like thanks, nor reward, at their children or friendes handes for all the reste, as they shoulde haue at Chrstes handes for that. But yet all this can not perswade them, for the moste of our riche men are so gréedie and couetous, that they will departe wyth none of their goodes during their life, nor giue anye parte thereof to any such good vses after their death. Nay, there haue bene some that were so bewitched, that hauing some pore kindred and no children, at their death would not giue them the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue of a peny, but haue giuen it all to their executors, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che had more than inough before to liue on.

Well, thoughe there are manye wyth vs,
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:9438:92"/>
that spend their money vainely in their life, and leaue theyr goods as fondly after their death: Yet truly if our Prechers, Parsons.
