            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>The Republick being thus diſunited or diſſected into Shires, every Shire is intirely governed by one Officer called a Sheriffe, or Shire-reeve, <hi>Vicecomes,</hi> compounded of theſe two Saxon words <hi>scyr viz.

                  <p>The aforeſayd <hi>Alfred</hi> at the diviſion of the Kingdome into Shires or Counties, inſtituted this Court called the County Court, and eſtabliſhed Juriſdiction in it; grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing power and authority to the Sheriffe to heare and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine ſuch matters as by juſt cauſe of appellation (ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for Law or Equity) ſhould be brought unto him. This Court (as it is recorded by Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> in his Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe of Tythes) was joyntly exerciſed by the Biſhop of the Dioceſſe, and by the Sheriffe or Alderman of the <hi>ſciregemot,</hi> or Hundred, or County Court, where the one ſate to give <hi>Godes fight,</hi> the other for <hi>puruldre right,</hi> that is, the one to judge according to the Lawes of the Kingdome, the other to direct accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Divinity.

<pb n="211" facs="tcp:170372:119"/>
hath her, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> VVhereupon the Plaintif demurred: And it was now angued, that this plea was not good, becauſe the eſcape is alleadged 24 <hi>Novemb. 16. Jac.</hi> and the Action is brought <hi>Paſch. 17 Iac.</hi> And this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſall is alleaged a yeare after the eſcape, and after the Action brought. For it was alleaged, although <note place="margin">A repriſall by freſh ſuit before the action brought, excuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; but a repri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal after the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction brought, no excuſe.</note> a repriſall by freſh ſuit (if it had been before the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on brought) would peradventure have excuſed him; yet being after the Action brought, ſo as the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tif at the time of the Action brought had good cauſe to have the Action, the Repriſall after ſhall not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe him: and compared it to waſte brought for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations, which is amended pendant the Writ, it ſhall not excuſe him. So here.</p>
                  <p>And in proof thereof were cited, <hi>Coo. 3. fol.</hi> 52. <note place="margin">Coo. 3. fol. 52. <hi>Ridgleys</hi> Caſe. 23 E 4. 8. 13 E. 3. tit. bar. 253.</note>

But againſt this it was argued, That this repriſall, being alleaged to be by freſh ſuite, and before the plea pleaded, is good for the time, and he ſhall take ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage thereof to excuſe the Eſcape: For it is upon the matter no eſcape, when ſhee was re-taken by freſh ſuit; for that is a continuall purſuit, and the Law ſhall adjuge her in priſon always. And it is not like the caſe of Waſte; For there nothing was done after the Waſte committed, before the Action; and the Reparation hath not any relation, nor is the continuance of any former Act: but this Repriſall hath relation, and makes it no eſcape, <hi>ab initio.</hi> As a Diſtreſſe taken for Rent, and reſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and driven into another Mannor, which is purſued and re-taken, the party ſhall make his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vowry of the taking in the firſt place. So here. And it would otherwiſe be a great miſchieſe, if an Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape ſhould be againſt the wills of Sheriffs, or keepers of Priſons, by breach of priſon, or reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuing themſelves before they be brought to priſon, or in their going thither; and the priſoners be repriſed within two or three dayes, That an Action ſhould be brought in the <hi>Interim</hi> againſt the Gaoler, and that this Repri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall (when he hath the priſoner before the plea) ſhould not be an excuſe, eſpecially to the
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:170372:120"/>
                     <hi>Marſhall,</hi> who hath multitude of priſoners, and every day is to bring them unto the Hall by <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beas Corpus,</hi> or Rules of Court: If peradventure a Priſoner eſcapes, and an Action be brought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Marſhall</hi> the ſame day, before he can have any time to retake him; If he ſhould not be excuſed by the re-taking, hee would be charged with a multitude of ſuits, and could not have any remedy to excuſe him. And therefore it was compared to the pleading of a Fine levyed before the VVrit of <hi>Formedon,</hi> and Proclamations incurred, pendant the VVrit, before the plea pleaded, he well may take advantage thereof by pleading it, although when the Writ was brought, it was not compleat, nor could be pleaded, <hi>Vide 6 H.</hi> 7. 12. <note place="margin">6 H. 7. 12.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, it was moved, admitting this to be no plea, yet the Action lyes not here, becauſe the Eſcape is of a <hi>Feme Covert,</hi> where her <hi>Baron</hi> is ſubject to the Execution: So the Plaintiffe hath not loſt his debt; for by intendment ſhe might not have payd it, if ſhee had layne in priſon; For ſhee had nothing but what was her Husbands, and the Execution remaines yet againſt him.</p>
                  <p>Therefore Action of Debt lyes not, becauſe he is not totally deprived of his Debt, but an Action upon the Caſe in reſpect of the damage.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Stat. 1 R. 2. </note>And therefore it was ſaid, If one have Execution of a Statute of the Lands, Goods, and Body, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and the priſoner eſcapes; Yet becauſe the Lands remaine in Execution, debt lyes not for the Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape, but an Action upon the Caſe: For at the Common Law, an Action of Debt was not maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able for an Eſcape; but it is given by the Statute of 1 <hi>Richard</hi> 2. where the Debtor eſcapes. But here the ſole and principall Debtor did not eſcape; for the Baron is the Principall and remained ſubject to the Execution. <hi>vide 33 H. 6. 47. N. Br. 93.

                  <p>Wherefore, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But the Court held, that it was not any plea, becauſe the Action is brought, and implyes a voluntary permiſſion, <hi>ire ad largum,</hi> which is neither denyed or traverſed. And if the
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:170372:120"/>
Sheriffe voluntarily lets a priſoner at large, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not re-take him. And ſo this Repriſall, as is allea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, being after the Action brought, is to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, nor is any plea. And for the Action of Debt, they held, that it well enough lyes, or an Action upon the Caſe at his pleaſure; Becauſe the Feme was onely committed to priſon, and not the Baron: And ſhee is the ſole Debtor, who is impriſoned, wherefore it was adjudged for the Plaintiff.</p>

All which you are to enquire of. Alſo you muſt know, that if one man wilfully kill another, or if a man kill or drowne himſelfe, the firſt doth forfeit by that fact both his lands and his goods, and the other forfeits but Goods and Chattels, and no lands. And if any homicide happen to be wilfull murther, which offence cannot be too ſeverely puniſhed, and therefore by the Law, the offender hereon ought to loſe both life, lands, and goods. And if it be found Manſlaughter, if the Offender can read, then he may in favour of his life, by His Highneſſe the LORD PROTECTOR's mercy, have the benefit of his Clergy, and ſo ſave his life, but he ſhall forfeit both his Lands and Goods. The Goods muſt be found appriſed and valued, of ſuch offenders, and left in the Town or Village where ſuch offender dwelleth, by them ſafely to be kept, until the Offender be acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted or convicted by due courſe of Law; the <hi>interim</hi> the Offender muſt be maintained with his goods, ſo as he may be kept alive to anſwer his fact, and what ſhall remain when he is convicted, thoſe to whom ſuch goods do belong by the Law muſt have them, and not before, and thereof diſcharge the Towne or Village which had the cuſtody of ſuch goods. And as for the Offenders Free Land, if he have any, immediatly after Conviction His Highneſſe muſt have <hi>annum, diem, &amp; vaſtum</hi> therein, and after, the Lord of whom it is holden, ſhall have it as an Eſcheat.</p>

                     <p>YOU of the Jury, the charge, which you by oath have promiſed to obſerve, toucheth, and concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth divers good Lawes and Statutes inſtituted and made for the preſervation of the publick Peace, and alſo for the private tranquillity of every one of you, and your poſterities, which matters the Sheriffe <hi>(or the Lord of this Franchiſe)</hi> conſidering and wiſhing your ſecurity, and deſiring likewiſe good orders to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved and kept among you, that right and equity may be adminiſtred to every of you, hath therefore cauſed his Highneſſe the Lord Protectors <hi>Leete</hi> to be ſummoned and kept here this day: I will therefore, by your favour, before I enter upon the principals of your charge, declare unto you, by what autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity you are brought hither, and wherein you are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to obſerve.</p>
                     <p>The cauſes hereof are two.</p>
                     <p>1. The firſt is, for that his Highneſſe, and royall predeceſſors, have given and granted unto the Sheriffe <hi>(or Lord of this Mannor)</hi> authority and power to keep a <hi>Leet,</hi> or Law day, twice in the year, at which <hi>Leet,</hi> or Law-day, all the <hi>Headboroughs, Tithingmen,</hi> &amp; <hi>Dezmers,</hi> and all other perſons that are reſident or inhabiting within the Juriſdiction of this <hi>Leet,</hi> being above the
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:170372:174"/>
age of twelve yeares, and under the age of ſixty, are bound by the Lawes of the <hi>Commonwealth</hi> to appeare: to the intent that the Lawes and Statutes may be there publiſhed and declared, ſo that knowing the dangers of the not obſerving of them, they may avoid divers inconveniences, which otherwiſe would have much prejudiced them: and further to inquire of the brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of the ſame, and preſent them, that ſuch offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders may receive condign puniſhment.</p>
                     <p>The other cauſe or authority is, for that you being the Lords tenants, are bound by reaſon of your tenure at the Lords <hi>Court Baron,</hi> when it ſhall happen to be kept according to law, that is to ſay, at every three weeks end, <hi>(or according as the cuſtome is)</hi> and being here by theſe two authorities, you are bound to ſerve in all ſuch things, as you are legally and joyntly char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged withall, as well concerning His Higneſſe the Lord Protectors <hi>Leet,</hi> as the Lords <hi>Court-Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now, to the intent that you may have better cognizance of your oath; I think it convenient (with your patience) to inſiſt a little upon it.</p>

                     <head>What things are to be conſidered by a Jury in ſwearing.</head>
                     <p>IN ſwearing three things are principally to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That you ſwear, to ſeclude all favour and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <note place="margin">The firſt conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration.</note> to the parties, not fearing the rich, nor pitying the poor, not conſidering the ſimplicity of any perſon, nor the ſmallneſſe of the offence, but having an affection to truth before your eyes, declare that which is truth to your knowledge, and no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The ſecond is, you muſt ſwear in righteouſneſs, <note place="margin">The ſecond con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration.</note> 
                        <hi>viz.</hi> for the very zeal and deſire you have in declaring the truth, <hi>for the executing of juſtice,</hi> for the obſerving of Covenants, honeſt promiſes, Statutes, Lawes, and good Cuſtomes, and having a reſpect in doing and
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:170372:174"/>
performing theſe things, you do that which tends to the glory of God, the honour of the Lord Protector, the preſervation of the People and Common-wealth: which kinde of ſwearing is the mandate of the Almighty. <note place="margin">Deut. c. 6.</note>
                        <hi>Thou ſhalt feare the Lord thy God and ſerve him, and ſhalt ſweare by his Name.</hi> That is, we muſt onely ſerve and feare him, acknowledging his holy Name, which is done by a legall ſwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring. It is alſo commanded in many places of the divine Writ, but conditionally; (to wit) we muſt ſweare in truth, in Judgment and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. In ſwearing, and taking an <hi>Oath,</hi> you muſt <note place="margin">The third con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration.</note> do it with Judgement, not raſhly, nor unadviſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but ſoberly, and with caution, conſidering what an oath is, which in briefe I will declare to you.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">What an oath is. </note>An <hi>Oath</hi> is, the recording or calling to witneſſe the name of God; to confirme the truth of that we ſay, and which is according to the teſtimony of St. <hi>Paul. An oath for confirmation is among men an end</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Hebr. cap. 6. v. 16, 17.</note> 
                        <hi>of ſtrife.</hi> For in ambiguous and obſcure matters, where the knowledge of men is brittle and fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, we betake ourſelves to God, that he which is the only Truth may give a Teſtimony unto the truth, and he that uſeth God for a Witneſſe, doth alſo call for revenge of perjury at his hands, if he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive and ſpeak not the truth: now, at the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of your hands upon the Booke, you ſweare truly to enquire, and make a true pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment of theſe things wherewith you are char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, and not to let from declaring the truth, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for favour, fear, affection, or envy of any perſon: conſider, that in this Book is recorded Gods eternall verity, whereby we have remiſſion of <hi>errors</hi> and offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and an enjoyment of eternall <hi>ſalvation.</hi> I am confident of your knowledge of the <hi>plagues</hi> and threats (in the <hi>Goſpel)</hi> to the obſtinate, and perjured, bearers of falſe and unjuſt teſtimony, condemners of innocent and guiltleſſe perſons, ſo that it you voluntarily perjure your ſelves, you abſolutely deny God, his mercy, truth, and the merits of our <hi>Saviour,</hi>
                        <pb n="322" facs="tcp:170372:175"/>
betaking your ſelves, and adhering to that Deſtroyer of mankinde, the <hi>Devil,</hi> the author of all pejury and perſidiouſneſſe: and by forſwearing and forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the truth, you forſake <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the light and truth it ſelfe. And although that perjury doth eſcape ſometimes uneſpied, and puniſhed, and be kept ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret betweene ſome of you and others, yet your <hi>hearts</hi> will judge and repute one another falſe, and be ſuſpitious of each others actions. But God <hi>(that faithfull one of Iſrael)</hi> will not deny himſelfe, neither will he ſuffer the profanation of his <hi>Name</hi> to go unpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed; when at the laſt day the ſecrets of all mens <hi>hearts</hi> ſhall be apparent, then the truth and your <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences</hi> ſhall be your accuſers, and <hi>Chriſt</hi> the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>Judge</hi> ſhall juſtly condemn you to eternall death and damnation.

                     <p>7. Seventhly, in this, that Court-Barons cannot ſubſiſt without two Suitors <hi>ad minimum,</hi> but Court-Leets can well ſubſiſt without any Suitors.</p>
                     <p>8. Eighthly in this, that Court-Barons enquire of no offences committed againſt the Protector, but Court-Leets enquire of all offences under High-Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon committed againſt the State and dignity of the Protector.</p>
                     <p>9. In many other reſpects they differ, as that a <hi>Writ of error</hi> lieth upon a Judgement given in a Court-Leet, but not in a Court-Baron.</p>
                     <p>10. So in a Court-Leet a <hi>capias</hi> lieth, but in a Court-Baron, inſtead of a <hi>capias</hi> is uſed an <hi>Attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> by goods.</p>

                        <pb n="342" facs="tcp:170372:193"/>
11. So in a <hi>Court-Baron</hi> an action of Debt lieth for the <hi>Lord</hi> himſelfe, becanſe the <hi>Suitors</hi> are Judges, but in a <hi>Court-Leet</hi> the Lord cannot maintain any action ſor himſelfe, becauſe the <hi>Steward</hi> is judge.</p>
