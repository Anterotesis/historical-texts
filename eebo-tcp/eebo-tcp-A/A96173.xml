            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

before <hi>Don Pedro</hi> the king,
ſirnamed the Cruel, took
his Text which invited
him to extoll Regal Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
to its higheſt pitch,
often ſaying, Few kings
went to hell; but in the
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:169924:19"/>
cloſe of his Sermon, ſaid,
You may, peradventure,
wonder that I ſo often tell
you that few kings go to
hell, marry the reaſon is,
there are but few kings,
for if there were more, they
would go all to the Devil.</p>
            <p>Of all theſe our kings, I
would know which was of
bleſſed memory, who ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
by blood, oppreſſion,

in contempt of God

(after ſo long and
grievous bondage under
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:169924:20"/>

            <p>And as the face of things

(Theſe digreſſions, though

the wheels of our State are
many whereon it goes, ſo
there are (God be thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed)
ſufficient to attend

Worſhipfull Familes of a

have been maintained by

why I mention not <hi>Edward</hi>

            <p>TO write the life and

a better book-man,
and a better pen-man: that
which I have to obſerve, is
onely to render him as
great a Tyrant as any of
the reſt; for though his
fearfulneſs kept him from
wars and blood, yet as
much as was in his power
he laid as many ſprings to
enſlave this Nation as ever
any; His will was the ſole
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:169924:24"/>
rule of his Government;
nor had the people any
thing to act but ſubmiſſive
obedience. His firſt work
was to ſound the Prelates
and Nobility, whoſe am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition
and corruption he
found ſuitable and ſervice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to his intentions; and
'twas their infuſion, ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable
to his diſpoſition,
that made him carry him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
ſo majeſtically to the
Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> (a
power he might juſtly fear
to offend) but their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels
(though they then ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
his and their ends) are
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:169924:24"/>
now come upon them like
a ſtorm, the one voted
down root and branch,
the other voted uſeleſſe
and dangerous.</p>
            <p>The King brings with
him a generall Peace with
all Chriſtendome, not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering
the particular in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
of this Nation, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it were honourable,
or ſafe, as the affaires of
<hi>England</hi> then ſtood, his
Predeceſſour having ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
upon her to be Head,
and Protectrix of the
Proteſtant party where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever:
But he had his
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:169924:25"/>
ends to himſelf. Firſt he
had heard how many and
how often attempts had
been uſed to take away the
life of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi>
whom God notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
preſerved and protect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
by the diligence of her
ſervants: but he would ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
truſt to his King-craft,
then to Gods providence.</p>
            <p>Then having taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
all thought of wars,
his deſign was to luxuriate
the people, that ſo hee
might more inſenſibly lay
that foundation of tyrany
he intended.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="41" facs="tcp:169924:25"/>
And now comes tumb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
in monſtrous exceſſe
of Riot, which conſumed
many good Families, and
more good Hoſpitality,
formerly the glory both of
our Nobility and Gentry;
with an incredible increaſe
of Tavernes and Bawdy-houſes,
for which two we
are to this day beholding
to the <hi>Scots.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And with this King, and
this Peace, came the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
Plague that ever this
Kingdome felt before his
time; as if God had told
us from heaven we had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:169924:26"/>
it, by betraying our
ſelves; and which was but
a light fore-running pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment,
in reſpect of
what in time ſhould fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low;
and yet peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
that Plague was but a
ſhadow of himſelfe, the
greater.</p>
            <p>The Kingdome could
not afford more pomp and
glory, then was ſhewn
when King <hi>James</hi> came
firſt through <hi>London;</hi> and
'twas ſo much the more
conſiderable as to him, that
from a naſty barren Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
(rather a Dunghil then
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:169924:26"/>
a Kingdome) came to be
at that inſtant as great a
Prince as any in Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome:
And indeed it was
the wonder of thoſe Stateſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
who had had expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
of the gallantry of
this Nation, that a <hi>Scot</hi>
ſhould enjoy this Crown
without reſiſtance. If the
temper of theſe our dayes
had then (as now) taken
head, we had ſaved much
blood: much mony, and in
all likelihood been long
ſince ſetled to ſuch a free
State, as we yet ſtruggle
for; Rich, and ſecure.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="44" facs="tcp:169924:27"/>
Long had he waited for
the death of Queen <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth;</hi>
but longer had they
waited, that waited upon
him: for had not their
hopes as well as his expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
their ſhares of ſpoils of
this Kingdome, we may
with out doing any wrong
to that Nation, conclude
him in the fate of his many
Predeceſſors, whom they
murdered. His Stock was
odious to the more anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
Nobility of that Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
and the cloak of the
Kirk would have ſerved
without ſcruple for ſuch a

covering, as the <hi>Grand-Signior</hi>
uſes to ſend men
doom'd to death.</p>
            <p>His original Extract I

               <pb n="46" facs="tcp:169924:28"/>
entertaines him with all
hoſpitable civility. <hi>Fleance</hi>
to requite his courteſie,
gets <hi>Lhewellins</hi> daughter
with child: <hi>Lhewellin</hi> mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
<hi>Fleance,</hi> and <hi>Lhewellins</hi>
daughter is afterward de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
of a ſon, named
<hi>Walter;</hi> this ſon proves a
gallant man, and falling
out with a Noble perſon
in <hi>Wales,</hi> that call'd him
Baſtard, <hi>Walter</hi> ſlew him,
and for his ſafeguard fled
into <hi>Scotland,</hi> where in
continuance of time he
gained ſo much reputation
and favour, that he became
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:169924:28"/>
Steward of the whole Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue
of that Kingdome,
of which Office, he and

to tell of his lazineſſe, and
his uncleanneſſe; but I
cannot do it without foul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

            <p>He was a great preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:169924:29"/>
to Learning and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
and for the ſpecula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
part, had as much as
any of our Kings upon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord;
but for the practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal,
and beſt part of it (if
we may judge of the Tree
by the Fruit) we may with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
breach of charity con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
him not guilty: He
was the greateſt Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
in the world; ſweare
faſter then ſpeak, and curſe
the people by the clock:
And it appeares by the
whole courſe of his life,
that he was a moſt malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
hater of this Nation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="49" facs="tcp:169924:29"/>
That inſolent act of <hi>Ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſey's</hi>
ſwitching my Lord
of <hi>Montgomery,</hi> at <hi>Banſted-Downs</hi>

had it been practiſed upon

The King was naturally
fearful, even as low as could
be; And what he would
do, and durſt not own, that
he would do by his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourites,
whom (for the
fitneſs of his deſigns) he
would raiſe from low de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree,
to oblige them the
more, and to deſert them

them often til he had them
ſitted to his purpoſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Dunbar</hi> was too ſolid,

This man the King had

of whom we may juſtly ſay
<hi>Trim tram, Like maſter, like

long wallowed in his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
bounty, and the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
of this Kingdome, he
fell the foulleſt that ever
man did, upon the rocks
of diſhonor, adultery, and
murder: Of diſhonour, to
a Noble Peer of this Land,
and in him to the whole,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:169924:31"/>
Nobility; Adultery, not
only to bewhore her, but
to get her divorced, and
marry her; And murder,
upon the body of that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate
Gentleman, Sir
<hi>Thomas Overbury,</hi> only for
diſſwading him.</p>
            <p>And here it is much to

this Favorites carriage had
highly offended Pr. <hi>Henry,</hi>
who underſtanding the

lived, eſpecially relating

him, and forbears
his company, and flatly fals

out with him. <hi>Somerſet</hi>
complaines to the King:
ſhortly the Prince falls ſick
and dies.</p>
            <p>That he was poyſoned,
hath been a common fame
ever ſince: But to ſnuffe
the candle, and make it
burn cleare, take the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony
of theſe famous
Phyſitians, that diſſected
his body, and have left it
upon record under their

This Prince was an active
man, and full of high
thoughts; A Lover of this
Nation, and lookt upon by
them with much affection
and expectation. What
feares &amp; jealouſies <hi>Somerſet</hi>
might maliciouſly infuſe
into the Kings too fearful
and timorous ſoul, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
tell: but that language
from <hi>Somerſet</hi> to the Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant
of the Tower, when
he told him he muſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
himſelf to go the next
morning to <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> to
his Trial, ſaid, <hi>He would not;
That the King had aſſured
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:169924:34"/>
him, he ſhould not come to
any trial; neither durſt the
King bring him to any trial.</hi>
This language, I ſay, ſtinks
abominably: And when
he did come to his Trial,
fearing (being enraged)
that he might flie out into
ſome ſtrange diſcovery,
there were two men placed
on each ſide of him with
cloaks on their arms, with
peremptory co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mand, that
if <hi>Sommerſet</hi> did any way
flie out againſt the King,
they ſhould inſtantly hood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wink
him w<hi rend="sup">th</hi> their cloaks,
take him violently from
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:169924:34"/>
the Bar, and carry him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way:
and this could be no
mans act but the Kings.
He would often boaſt of
his King-craft; but if his
feares, and <hi>Somerſets</hi> malice
took this Princes life a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,
'twas a ſweet peece of
King-craft indeed, but the
fruit of it hath been bitter.</p>
            <p>I cannot enough admire
that language hee uſed,
when he gave in charge to
his Judges the Examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Sir <hi>Thomas Overburi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi>
murder:</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="60" facs="tcp:169924:35"/>
My Lords,<hi> I charge you,
as you will anſwer it at that
great and terrible day of
Judgment, that you examine
it ſtrictly, without favour,
affection, or partiality: And
if you ſhall ſpare any guilty
of this crime; Gods curſe
light upon you and your po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity;
and if I ſhall ſpare
any that are found guilty,
Gods curſe light on me and
my poſterity for ever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This expreſſion hath a
moſt honeſt out-ſide: but
if the King had a deſigne
of feare, rather to be ſo rid
of <hi>Somerſet,</hi> then an inward
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:169924:35"/>
deſire of Juſtice, 'twas
monſtrous foule; which
we ſhall better judge of
by the ſequel.</p>
            <p>Seven perſons were by
the Judges condemned to
die for this foule murder;
four of them of the leaſt
account, and acceſſaries, are
executed; the three great
ones, and principals, the
King pardons; and to <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merſet</hi>
himſelf, to his dying
day, was moſt profuſely li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beral,
and ſuffered to live
with that fire-brand of hel
his wife, under the Kings
noſe, all the dayes of their
lives.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="62" facs="tcp:169924:36"/>
Here's fine jugling! theſe
muſt be ſaved, for fear of
telling Scotch tales of
the King. Would the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
of thoſe noble ſouls of
theſe our dayes, put up
ſuch a piece of injuſtice in
the maſter, and ſuch an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front
and contempt of this
Nation, both from the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
and the man (two
Scots) without vengeance?
I believe not.</p>
            <p>And this Favourite of
his, when his eſtate was ſei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
upon for this foul mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
was found to have
two hundred thouſand
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:169924:36"/>
pounds in mony, plate and
jewels, in his houſe; and
nineteen thouſand pounds
a year in Lands comming
in: a fine advance from a
Scots Page; fifty pounds,
and a Suit of Cloaths: (and
can any man tel for what?)
I never heard that all <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
was worth ſo much.
But enough of him.</p>
            <p>This King had no Wars;
but ſpent more mony pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digally,
profuſely, and rio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſly
then any of his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſors.</p>
            <p>What ſwarms of Scots
came with him, and after
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:169924:37"/>
him, into this kingdome?
who perpetually ſuckt him
of moſt vaſt ſums of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys,
which ſtand yet upon
record; which put him
upon all diſhonourable
wayes of raiſing monies,
to the moſt cruell oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of this Nation, to ſerve
their riot and luxury: but
there are many yet living
can juſtifie this truth:
Though they lived a while
at ſuch a height; yet they
died like themſelves, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible,
miſerable Beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers;
and at this day ſcarce
one of them can ſhew the
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:169924:37"/>
fruits of thoſe vaſt dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives,
either in themſelves,
or their poſterity, that's
worth looking upon: And
ſo let them all periſh,
whomſoever, <hi>Scots</hi> or <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh,</hi>
whoſe foundation is
ſuch. Though, I ſee no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
but any eſtate may be
now queſtioned, which is
known to have been raiſed
upon the oppreſſion of this
Nation; nor that any title
of Honour ſo bought
ſhould deſcend to poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
            <p>A Lord is to be a Lord
by merit of imployment in
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:169924:38"/>
ſome noble Office, for the
publique good; not by
projecting tricks, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zening
devices to fill a Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant's
Coffers, to the enſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
of a gallant free Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
But, &amp;c. to return to
King <hi>James.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In thoſe dayes 'tis true,
the Biſhops, Nobility, and
the Lawyers, had a great
influence upon the people
for their abilities, and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
honeſties; yet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
theſe, ſuch are
found, and others are made
ſuch, that whatſoever the
King would have, they are
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:169924:38"/>
fit, and willing inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
to bring it about,
and make it paſſe for cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
Divinity, and Law.
Witneſſe,</p>
            <p>The burning of a whole
Cart-load of Parliament
Preſidents, that ſpake the

            <p>Witneſſe the life of Sir

            <p>Witnes, the lamentable

            <p>Witnes, the Treaty of

            <p>In which two laſt, this
Nation received more diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour,
then in any action
any former age can paralel,
and all under the colour of
an honourable Treaty. His
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:169924:39"/>
Daughter was undone, and
his Son bob'd of a Wife,
after the hazard of his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
and vaſt expence of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
treaſure to this day
undiſcharged.</p>
            <p>I could never under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
what piece of King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft
it was, to let the
Prince his onely Son, with
<hi>Buckingham</hi> his favourite,
make that Voyage into
<hi>Spain,</hi> unleſſe it were to
be rid of them both: and
had he not had to do with
a noble Enemy, ſurely they

            <p>
               <pb n="70" facs="tcp:169924:40"/>
Hee would ſometimes

quarrel by his prerogative,

            <p>His Favourite <hi>Somerſet</hi>
being condemn'd, and qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etly
laid aſide, he was ready
provided of another, <hi>George

young man, lately return'd

allowance of Threeſcore
pounds a year: who comes

of the Bedchamber,
and the ſame day a Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
pounds a yeare out of
the <hi>Court of Wards</hi> given
him; and in a breath made
Maſter of the Horſe, then
Knight of the Garter, then
Baron of <hi>Whadon,</hi> Viſcount
<hi>Villiers,</hi> Earl of <hi>Somerſet,</hi> and
a Privy-Councellor, Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſſe
of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> Lord
Admiral of <hi>England,</hi> Chief
Juſtice in Eyre of all the

Head—Steward of <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter,</hi>
and Conſtable of
<hi>Windſor</hi>-Caſtle, and laſtly

go no higher in title; but
by his Maſters pleaſure and
courteſie, all the affairs of
the Kingdome are ſteered
by his compaſſe, as is at
large made known in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
mens writings publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
Yet when he knew
his Maſter (notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his ſlabbering expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
of affection, and
extravagant Honours and
riches) to be weary of him,
he found a Plaiſter and a

Powder, that made him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends
for all his favours;
And here the King-craft
met with his match. How

not; but the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
familiarity between
them, continued ſo long

from being queſtioned for

is no ſmall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption.</p>
            <p>But what the King de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied

ſay much of that Prince:
Only this I can ſay; He
was a man ſo wilfull, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate,
and uxorious, that
he quite forſook his own
intereſt as a King, and
the honour and intereſt of
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:169924:46"/>
this Nation, thorough
malice, and her counſel;
and did ſo farre incline
to the intereſt of <hi>France</hi>
againſt <hi>Spaine,</hi> (and no
thankes for his labour)
that by his meanes alone
<hi>Rochel</hi> and <hi>Dunkirk</hi> were
both loſt: But that, and his
Fathers inſtructions, loſt
him, with the loſſe of more
blood and treaſure to this
Nation, then all our wars
had ſpent ſince the <hi>William</hi>
the Norman.</p>
            <p>It hath been to me the
greateſt wonder of the
world, how this King could
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:169924:46"/>
be ſo blind, as not to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
that ſtorm that came
upon him, till it was too
late. Were all his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellors
falſe? O unhappy
King! Or would he be ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
by none but himſelfe
and his wife? O more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy
man! (Surely in this
was the hand of God moſt
viſible.) Miſchief was in
his heart againſt this Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
but it came upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
&amp; all his, as the world
hath ſeen.</p>
            <p>There was about the
time of his death, a Book
publiſhed, which was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:169924:47"/>
to the world, as He
the Author: which was
ſo groſs an impoſture, that
I have much marvail'd (the
fraud being ſo plain, and
eaſily detected) that no
courſe hath been taken to
find him out, and puniſh'd,
that made it: For that it
was not his, is as plainly to
be diſcerned, as the Sun at
noon. But that falſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fume
laſted but a while,
&amp; the ſcent was only plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
to them that could
not ſmell.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="85" facs="tcp:169924:47"/>
So that I may ſay, that
in our dayes we have ſeen
two the moſt remarkable
and moſt eminent paſſages
of humane affaires, that
this Nation hath afforded
ſince the Creation:</p>
            <p>The Entrance of King
<hi>James</hi> into this Kingdome,
with as much pomp and
glory as the World could
afford:</p>
            <p>And the Exit of his Son,
with as much ſhame and
miſery as could befall a
King.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="86" facs="tcp:169924:48"/>
And although God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
be the Judge of all
men; yet Gods judgments
that are ſo remarkable, are
for our inſtructions, and
God is to be glorified by us
for theſe judgments of his
upon this Kings family.</p>
            <p>I cannot in the beſt ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
I have read, find who
was clearly King <hi>James</hi> his
Father.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mary</hi> Queen of <hi>Scotland</hi>
(a luſty young Widow)
marries the Lord <hi>Darly</hi> ſon
to the D. of <hi>Lenox,</hi> in the
year 1565. or thereabouts:
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:169924:48"/>
and at the ſame time, had
for a reſerve in great favor
with her an Italian Fidler,
and <hi>Bothwel</hi> a Scotch Lord.
After marriage, the Queen
proves with childe. The
King her huſband, that was
Lord <hi>Darly,</hi> (enraged by
ſome informations) comes
into the roome where the
Queen his wife was at ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
and very big; drags the
Italian Fidler into another
roome, and murders him.
The Queen was ſhortly
delivered of a Son, which
was our King <hi>James.</hi> The
ſolemnity of the Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:169924:49"/>
ended, ſhe and <hi>Bothwel</hi>
murdred the King her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band.
Then the Queen
marries <hi>Bothwel,</hi> (and all
this in a moment of time)
but they are both fain to
flie; The Queen came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>England,</hi> and was here
beheaded; <hi>Bothwel</hi> fled in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>Denmark,</hi> and there lay
in priſon all the dayes of
his life.</p>
            <p>And now (Reader) ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
the fortune of this
prodigious Family.</p>
            <p>His ſuppoſed Father was
ſtrangled in his bed, by the
conſent of his mother, and
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:169924:49"/>
flung out into a garden.</p>
            <p>His Mother is beheaded.</p>
            <p>His eldeſt Son Pr. <hi>Henry,</hi>
by the jealouſie, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
of his Father, in the
flower of his youth and
ſtrength of his age, is poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned.</p>
            <p>His Daughter, married
to the Palſgrave; where
ſhortly her Husband (in
ambition to becom a king)
is ſlain, and ſhe with her
many children are driven
out of their eſtates, and flie
for ſhelter into <hi>Holland,</hi>
where ſhe hath lived ever
ſince upon the courteſie of
this State.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="90" facs="tcp:169924:50"/>
Her eldeſt Son, having
lived long upon a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
charity of this Nation,
is now at length reſtored
to a feather of his gooſe.</p>
            <p>Two other of her ſons,
after ſix yeares following
arms and plunder for King
<hi>Charles,</hi> turn'd Pyrates at
ſea, and ſo are at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent.</p>
            <p>King <hi>James</hi> himſelf (after
two &amp; twenty years reign,
by the act of his Favourite
<hi>Buckingham,</hi> and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
of his ſon <hi>Charles</hi> that
ſucceeded him) is poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="91" facs="tcp:169924:50"/>
King <hi>Charles,</hi> after eight
years was with the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
is taken, arraigned
and condemn'd, and is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed
at his own dores;
his Wife fled home to her
friends, and his Children
ſcattered abroad in the
world, to live upon the
charity of others.</p>
            <p>Are all theſe circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
to be ſlighted, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſidered?
And ſhall we
take the Prieſts word;
<hi>King</hi> James <hi>was of bleſſed
memory?</hi> I challenge the
proudeſt of them; let them
publiſh one cleare act of
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:169924:51"/>
Honeſty from him all the
time of his reign, or any
honeſtman that ever he lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
&amp; I'le yield. His hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie,
perjury, cowardiſe,
blaſphemy, malice, are
known to all; and baſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude,
which compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends
more then all the
reſt: whereof one example
of him is well worth our
remembring, to Sir <hi>Henry
Wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>on,</hi> which briefly was
thus:</p>
            <p>Sir <hi>Henry</hi> (a man for per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
&amp; parts highly eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and honoured of all
that knew him) being in
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:169924:51"/>
               <hi>Florence,</hi> when Queen <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeths</hi>
death drew nigh,
(which King <hi>Iames</hi> gaped
for) the Duke of <hi>Florence</hi>
had intercepted ſome Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
which diſcovered a
deſigne to take away the
life of King <hi>James:</hi> The
Duke abhorring the fact,
reſolves to endeavour the
prevention, calls for his
Secretary to adviſe by
what meanes a caution
might be beſt given to the
King; and it was reſolved
to be done by Sir <hi>Henry
Wotton,</hi> who (being well
inſtructed) is preſently
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:169924:52"/>
diſpatched into <hi>Scotland</hi>
with Letters to the King,
and moſt rare Antidotes
againſt all manner of poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
whereby that miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief
was prevented; and
Sir <hi>Henry Wotton</hi> returns
into <hi>Italy,</hi> where ſhortly
after came the news of the
death of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi>
and <hi>James</hi> King of <hi>Scots</hi>
proclaimed King of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi>
and away comes Sir
<hi>Henry Wotton,</hi> to joy the
King.</p>
            <p>This had been a fit Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
for to have ſhewn his
Noble minde upon for a
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:169924:52"/>
Favourite: but what doth
the King? takes him into
two and twenty years tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile,
like a pack horſe, to
make him an Agent in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
parts, and leaves him
in his old age in <hi>Eaton</hi>-Colledge,
unable to pay
his debts, as many appear by
his lamentable complaint
upon his death-bed; his
words are theſe in his Laſt-Will
and Teſtament.</p>
            <q>I humbly beſeech my Lords
Grace of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and
the Lord Biſhop of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi>
to intercede with our
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:169924:53"/>
moſt gracious Soveraign,
(in the bowels of Ieſus
Chriſt) that out of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſionate
memory of my
long ſervices, ſome order
may be taken for my Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rears,
for ſatisfaction of
my Debts.</q>
            <p>This preſident alone is ſo
tranſcendently foul, as all
his other actions and paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
are vertues to it. Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes
of no merit, at home,
muſt wallow in his bounty
and their own luxury, to
do his foul pleaſure, and to
execute his tyranical acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:169924:53"/>
whileſt ſuch a Noble
Soul as this, muſt ſuffer
want, and die in it.</p>
            <p>And now lay all theſe
things together, the lives
of all our former Kings,
and the lamentable condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of this Nation under
theſe two laſt; and tell me
if it were not high time to
conſider of the honour,
welfare and ſecurity of this
Nation, by reducing it to
a Free-State.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="98" facs="tcp:169924:54"/>
But before I take my
leave of theſe Kings, I
would willingly (as a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parative
to the cordial a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement
of our <hi>Free-State)</hi>
preſent ſome few Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations;
and herein I ſhall
onely ſhew my hand, and
my heart, wiſhing that
ſome abler Pen-man may
more ſubſtantially publiſh
ſomething to this purpoſe,
in better language, and
more at large.</p>
            <p>Firſt, How often wee
have been made ſlaves to
Forreign powers, by not
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:169924:54"/>
agreeing among our ſelvs.</p>
            <p>Our Kings having other
Dominions beyond ſeas,
have conſum'd our blood
and treaſure, to defend,
maintain, or increaſe them
at their pleaſures: And
their frequent matching
into ſtrangers blood, hath
increaſed new titles, and
pretences of quarrels, that
have afforded matter for
bitter warres, both abroad
and at home. All which
are now laid aſleep.</p>
            <p>Next is worth our ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
conſideration, How
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:169924:55"/>
God Almighty in his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
hath divided us
from all the World by a
wall of Water, and hath
brought us into a conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this day, by Shipping,
Trade, and able Sea-men
and Merchants, that no
Prince in Chriſtendome
can ſhew the like for num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
and abilitie: So that
now we have no Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
for Matches, nor bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſines
with Foraign Princes
but for Trade. And here
let me uſe the words of Sir
<hi>Walter Raleigh,</hi> in his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
of Shipping:</p>
            <q>
               <pb n="101" facs="tcp:169924:55"/>
Whoſoever commands the
Sea, commands the Trade:
Whoſoever commands the
Trade of the World, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
the Riches of the
World, and conſequently the
World it ſelf.</q>
            <p>A faire invitation to
cheriſh Shipping, Sea-men,
and Merchants.</p>
            <p>And if hereafter we fall
into difference with any
Forreign Prince, we fight
for our ſelves, not for ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grounded
Titles, nor to
ſatisfie the ambition of
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:169924:56"/>
particular, nor to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
the luxury of any ſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Iſſue.</p>
            <p>There are but two things
(which I mentioned in the
<hi>Introduction)</hi> can obſtruct
us (as I hope) <hi>IRELAND,</hi>
and Envious <hi>Presbytery:</hi>
The <hi>Royaliſt,</hi> I preſume,
will heare reaſon; And
<hi>SCOTLAND,</hi> I ſuppoſe,
will ſhortly be reduced to
an Engliſh Province, and
kept ſo by force; for <hi>Jocky</hi>
is not to be truſted; He is
naturally ſo falſe, and hath
been ſo high-fed ſince their
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:169924:56"/>
Scotch king came to this
Crowne, that his owne
Country—fare will not
down, till they be hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled,
(which, God be
thanked, is in a faire
way.)</p>
            <p>Yet if there be any of
that Nation ſenſible of
their owne ſecurity and
welfare under our wing,
(which I much feare) that
ſhall comply in this union,
I ſhall pray to God to make
them good Chriſtians.</p>
            <p>And if any Forreigne
Prince whatſoever, ſhall
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:169924:57"/>
hereafter (through ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
or envy to our State,
or pretence of donation
from the Pope) aſſiſt or
maintain, a Faction either
in <hi>Scotland</hi> or <hi>Ireland,</hi> (as
heretofore) to hinder, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice,
or moleſt our right
or intereſt in theſe, or ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of theſe places; I ſee
no reaſon why we ſhould
treat with them as friends.</p>
            <p>But I am now beſide my
Cuſhion: my end is only
to prepare and perſwade
a hearty Agreement a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
our ſelves, to the
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:169924:57"/>
ſecure ſetling of our Free-State.
So farewell <hi>Scot,</hi>
and farewell <hi>King;</hi> And
GOD bleſſe the <hi>Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth</hi>
of <hi>ENGLAND.</hi>
