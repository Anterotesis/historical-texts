         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>WHilſt ſome to promote their own private Intereſt are defrauding the whole Nation; I to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the Nations Intereſt, am venturing my little <hi>All.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the Adulterating of Gold and Silver, brings in ſo great Gain to the Practicers of that Deceit, that ſome of them have threatned the Ruin of any one that ſhall ſeek to hinder their Adulterating Trade; which is now ſo ſtrongly beſet by ſome Honeſt Goldſmiths, that it hath made Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terating Goldſmiths deſperate. But let not the Honeſt Goldſmiths be diſcouraged from proſecuting their deſigned and intended Reformation, by any of their Threats, or any of their Contemptious Names, which they call you: for it is better for you to be called Informers (which in this caſe is creditable and praiſe-worthy) for diſcovering theſe Defrauds, than to be farther Guilty of the Nations Wrong, by concealing it: And though you who have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly Adulterated Gold and Silver, but now abhor it, are upbraided with your former Practices; if you hold your Reſolution to make Satisfaction to your Cuſtomers, whom you have wronged by theſe Wares; you will evidence your ſelves to be Honeſt Men: notwithſtanding thoſe who ſtill practice that wicked Art, brand you with your
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:30721:3"/>
former Practices, becauſe they would hold on theirs: Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they have no ſuch matter of Fact to lay to my Charge, ſince I have finiſhed my Apprenticeſhip; yet I muſt ſhare in their Reproaches, Revileings, Genſures, Slanders, Scoffs and Scorns; which I have had a portion of already, for not joyning with others in Adulterating Gold and Silver; and ſhall doubtleſs have a greater ſhare now, when I labour to prevent others from going on in that Practice.</p>
            <p>Let the abuſed Stranger therefore underſtand, That there is a certain Standard for Gold and Silver, according to which Standard the Coyns of this Kingdom (both Gold and Silver) are made: and as good as that Standard, all Plate and Small Wares in Gold and Silver is to be made (by Plate and Small Wares, I intend all ſorts of Gold and Silver Wares whatſoever; the Small as well as the Great) and that there may be no Defraud uſed by making any Gold and Silver Work worſe than the Standard, there is a very eaſie and ſure way appointed by Law for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulating of thoſe Wares; the underſtanding of which may be of ſignal benefit to all who buy and wear any ſorts of Gold and Silver Wares whatſoever: the end and deſign of this Sheet, is therefore to diſcover it.</p>
            <p>As for <hi>London</hi> and the places adjacent, the Company of Goldſmiths hath the over-ſight of thoſe Wares, and the tryal of them committed to them; and therefore three days in the Week, there is tryal made of any Workmans Wares (whoſe Name and Mark is inrouled in their <hi>Aſſay Office</hi>) and whatſoever Works they try and find Standard, is mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked with theſe marks following: Firſt, The Workmans Mark which made the Wares (which is uſually the two firſt Letters of his Chriſtian and Sir Name; and every Workmans Mark differs from others) the ſecond is a Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pards
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:30721:3"/>
Head Crowned, the third is a Lyon, the fourth is a ſingle Letter (the Letter which is uſed this preſent year being <hi>(V)</hi> and whatſoever Plate or Small Wares, have theſe Marks on them, is not to be queſtioned but that it is Sterlin or Standard (that is as good as Money.)</p>
            <p>But there being ſeveral ſorts of Small Wares, both in Gold and Silver, which cannot be Aſſayed and Marked at <hi>Goldſmiths-Hall,</hi> after it is finiſhed; it is therefore ſold with the private Workmans Mark: And to prevent Defrauds in this, All Workers in Gold and Silver, in <hi>London</hi> and its Suburbs, are required by Law to make known their Marks, to the Wardens of the Company of Goldſmiths, That one Workman may not ſtrike a Mark that is like ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Workmans; and that any perſons which have Wares marked with the Workmans Marks only, may by addreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing themſelves to the Company of Goldſmiths (at their Hall in <hi>Foſter-lane</hi>) find out the Makers of their Wares; and if the Wares which they have marked, be found worſe than Standard; the Company of Goldſmiths will procure the agrieved party Recompence, and puniſh the Workman. The Reader cannot but be ſatisfied of the excellency of this way of warranting Silver: but I ſhall ſhew you how its neglected to the Publicks great wrong. Although the War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens of the Company of Goldſmiths, have power to ſearch any Goldſmiths Shops and Houſes, and carry away any Works which they ſhall make choice of to try them, whether they be Standard or not, and to fine the Owners, if they find them worſe than Standard: yet the Workers and Sellers of Gold and Silver Wares, being ſo numerous, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed in their Dwellings to all parts of the City and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hurbs; it is not eaſie that all their Small Wares can be found out, by the Wardens of the Company to be tryed; they being ſold therefore upon the bare Workmans or Shopkee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:30721:4"/>
Credit, and they having the marking of theſe Wares themſelves; there are theſe Evils that do follow it,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Some of their Wares are not marked at all, though they may very well bear marking (whereby they are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited though they be Standard.) 2. Some of their Wares are marked with private marks, which are not inroulled at Goldſmiths-Hall: For ſome of them who have a Mark in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roulled at Goldſmiths-Hall, will have another Mark not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roulled; which Mark they will ſet upon Adulterated Wares; and this Counterfeit Mark ſhall be ſo like the inroulled Mark, that it will not be known to be the unlawful Mark, by any that doth not know what Marks are inroulled, and what are not; for there is only this difference, As if <hi rend="sup">PB</hi>, one over the other, is the Mark inroulled at Goldſmiths-Hall; then B P (one by the other) may be the Counterfeit Mark; or as if S, be the inroulled Mark, then I S, may be the Counterfeit Mark: or any other way, according to the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Workmans Device: So that theſe Marks cannot be known by the Common People, which are inroulled and which are not; neither can the Company of Goldſmiths, find out the Makers of bad Wares, by ſuch Marks as are not inroulled in their Hall, except ſome of their Servants providentially know them. The great loſs which comes to the Nation hereupon, I ſhall diſcover, which take as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth. The Workmen therefore and Shopkeepers, which have no more honeſty; agree together to make their Gold and Silver Wares, as much worſe than Standard as they pleaſe; which in Gold Wares, ſuch as Rings, Chains, Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral-Sockets, Bells, Bodkins; and almoſt all other ſmall Wares in Gold, is worſe than Standard, ſome 5 <hi>s.</hi> in the Ounce, ſome 10. <hi>s.</hi> in the Ounce, ſome 15 <hi>s.</hi> in the Ounce, ſome 1 <hi>l.</hi> in the Ounce, ſome 2 <hi>l.</hi> in the Ounce; which is half in half. And I may go on farther, for they do not ſtop there, but accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:30721:4"/>
to their own wills and pleaſures, go on in their Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terating Defrauds, as if there was neither Law nor Judges to puniſh them, but there is both; and that which is want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, is chiefly Proſecutors. Now the greatneſs of which Adulterating Cheat, I ſhall ſhew you in one Example of a Ring, about the uſual or moſt common courſneſs: I find a Burial Ring by the Aſſay worſe than Standard two Carracts, one Grain and three Quarters, which is in one Ounce 8 <hi>s.</hi> 11 <hi>d.</hi> 1 <hi>q.</hi> and it may be two-hundred of theſe Rings have been bought (or may hereafter be) by one party; which two hundred Rings may weigh twenty five Ounces, and the Buyer payeth 4 <hi>l.</hi> an Ounce (beſides the making or faſhion) which is the price of Standard: now reckon for the 25 Oun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces (which is the ſuppoſed weight of the two hundred Rings) ſo many times 8. <hi>s.</hi> 11 <hi>d.</hi> 1 <hi>q.</hi> which the one Ring is worſe than Standard; and it amounteth to 11 <hi>l.</hi> 3 <hi>s.</hi> 5. <hi>d.</hi> 1 <hi>q.</hi> ſo that if one party in one parcel of Burial Rings, be cheated ſo great a ſum; what is the whole Nation cheated in Adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated Wares? In Silver their practice is no better, for in moſt ſorts of Small Wares (which would fill my ſheet too innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merate) ſuch as Boxes, Bodkins, Buttons, Buckles, Claſps, Corral-Sockets, or Garniſhes, Chains, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is the like Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration uſed: the uſual price they take for theſe is 5 <hi>s.</hi> the Ounce beſides the making (or faſhion) when upon the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſay, I have ſeldom found any more worth than 4 <hi>s.</hi> the Ounce, and ſome worth but 3 <hi>s.</hi> 6 <hi>d.</hi> the Ounce, ſome worth but 3 <hi>s.</hi> ſome worth but 2 <hi>s.</hi> 6 <hi>d.</hi> the Ounce, ſome worth but 2 <hi>s.</hi> and ſome no better than Braſs Mony; ſo that as ſome Braſs Mony is better than others, ſo is ſome Goldſmiths Wares. And as if theſe Adulteratings of Gold and Silver were not enough, theſe Adulterating Goldſmiths, have farther added, to put clean Copper or Braſs Clappers, into their Silver Bells, and Braſs Wire into their Coral
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:30721:5"/>
Sockets; and that no ſmall quantity, ſometimes half an Ounce, ſometimes three quarters of an Ounce, or more, or leſs; as the Coral Socket will contain. Now the Reader may ſay to me, you have ſhewn us our loſs, but how ſhall we be helped; in which caſe I refer him to the Company of Gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſmiths, <hi>London</hi>; where any Adulterated Wares may be try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and if you can evidence of whom you bought your Wares, the Company will procure you ſatisfaction, and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh the Goldſmith which wronged you; and this without your trouble or charge: But the Adulterating of Gold or Silver Wares, forfeits double their worth; and therefore a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny agrieved party may proceed againſt the Goldſmith which has wronged him, by Action, Bill, Plaint, Information, or otherwiſe, wherein no Eſſoyn, Protection, or Wager of Law, ſhall be admitted for the Defendant. <hi>Stat.</hi> 18 <hi>Eliz.</hi> 15.</p>
            <p>And now, O my Country Men, who are greatly impoſed upon and wronged, by diſhoneſt Goldſmiths, and Traders in their Works, both in City and Country; you are to be advertiſed: That in the City of <hi>York, New caſtle upon Tine, Lincoln, Norwich, Briſtoll, Salisbury,</hi> and <hi>Coventry</hi>; it is ordained by the <hi>Stat.</hi> 2 <hi>Hen.</hi> 6.14. that every one ſhall have divers Touches, according to the Ordinance of the Mayors, Bayliffs, or Governours of the ſame Towns; and the Goldſmiths, in theſe Towns are to be ordered in the ſame manner as in <hi>London.</hi> And moreover, If any Goldſmith within the Realm of <hi>England</hi>; in any place where no Touch-Town is, ſhall make or ſell worſe Silver and Gold Wares than Mony, or omit to mark it; they are anſwerable for it (as thoſe in <hi>London</hi>) To conclude, I adviſe all Buyers and Wear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of Gold and Silver, both in City or Country; to ſee that their Plate have the <hi>London</hi> Touch, which is before deſcribed: and for ſuch things as cannot have them; to take Bills under the Goldſmiths Hands, they buy off, that it is Standard Gold, and Sterling Silver.</p>
