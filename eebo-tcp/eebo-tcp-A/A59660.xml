            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>The enmity put by the Lord between the <hi>seed of the Woman</hi> and <hi>the seed of the Serpent, Gen.</hi> 3.15. soon began to work, even in the infancy of the Church, in the family of our first Parents, as we see <hi>Gen.</hi> 4.8. by the Martyrdome of <hi>righteous Abel.</hi> No small portion of that fixed hatred, and hostility of the <hi>old Serpent,</hi> hath ever since been discovered against the young ones of Christs little flock. The multiplication of the Children of Israel, is the occasion why <hi>Pharaoh</hi> deals <hi>so wisely</hi> as we read; endeavouring first by the <hi>Midwives,</hi> secret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to destroy the <hi>male Children</hi>: and after that, more openly by an Edict, to <hi>drown them</hi> in his Egyptian waters; for which what ever his pretence might be, alleadged <hi>Exod.</hi> 1.10. yet no doubt (as <hi>Calvin</hi> on the place somewhat that way hint's) Satan had a design there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, to cut of the name and posteri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Hence also afterward we find this spite of the great <hi>accuser</hi> of the <hi>brethren,</hi> vented against these poor little ones, in the forbidding them Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with the Church of God in that Worship which God had

            <head>THE CHURCH-MEMBERSHIP OF CHILDREN CLEARED VP IN A LETTER IN ANSWER To the Doubts of a Friend.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hen we say, That Children are Members by their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents Covenant, I would premise three things for Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. That Children of Godly Parents come to the <hi>fruition</hi> of their Membership by their Parents Covenant, but that which give's them their <hi>right,</hi> and interest in this Membership is Gods Covenant, whereby he engageth himselfe equally to be a <hi>God to them, and to their Seed.</hi> This I suppose is clear.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That according to the double <hi>Seed,</hi> viz. 1. <hi>Elect Seed.</hi> 2. <hi>Church-Seed</hi>; So there is a double Covenant, 1. <hi>Exernal and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi>: 2. <hi>Internall and inward.</hi> And because the Covenant makes the Church, hence there is an inward, and outward Membership, and Church estate: there is an <hi>outward Iew,</hi> &amp; an <hi>inward Iew, Rom.</hi> 2.28, 29. All are not <hi>Israel</hi> (<hi>i. e.</hi> the elect Seed) that are of <hi>Israel</hi> (<hi>i. e.</hi> the Church-Seed of in outward Covenant) to whom the Apostle saith belong's <hi>the Adoption, the Covenants, and the promises,</hi> that is, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall Adoption whereby God account's them his Children, or the Children of his house, and family, the Children of the Church; and accordingly have the promises belonging to them in respect of outward dispensation, although they be not Children by internall Adoption, to whom belongs the promises by effectuall and speciall communication of saving Grace: It is clearer then the day, that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny who are inwardly, or in respect of inward Covenant, the Children
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:96691:13"/>
of the <hi>Devil,</hi> are outwardly, or in respect of outward Covenant, the Children of God, <hi>Isay.</hi> 1.2. <hi>I have brought up Children,</hi> and yet <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellions</hi>; and in the next verse they are called [<hi>my People</hi>] (<hi>i. e.</hi> by outward Covenant) and yet worse then <hi>the Ox, or Asse: Deut.</hi> 32.19, 20. they are called <hi>Sons,</hi> and yet <hi>provokeing God</hi> to revengefull Wrath; and <hi>Children</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and yet <hi>without Faith.</hi> And look, as some may be externally <hi>Dogs,</hi> and yet internally <hi>Believers:</hi> (as the woman of Canaan, whom, in respect of outward Covenant, Christ calls a <hi>Dog</hi>: and the <hi>Iewes,</hi> who yet rejected him, <hi>Children Mat.</hi> 15.26) so many may be externally Children, in respect of external Covenant, and yet internally <hi>Dogs,</hi> and evil men, and we see that the purest Churches of Christ are called <hi>Saints,</hi> and faithful, &amp; Children of God and yet many among them Hypocrites, and unbelievers; because they that in respect of Church estate, and outward Covenant, and profession, are outwardly, or federally Saints; are many times in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly, and really unsound: Hence therefore it is, that when we say, that Children are in Covenant, and so Church-Members, the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is, not that they are alwaies in inward Covenant, and inward Church-Members, who enjoy the inward, and saveing benefits of the Covenant, but that they are in external, and outward Covenant, and therefore outwardly Church Members, to whom belongs some outward priviledges of the Covenant for their inward and eternall good.</p>
            <p>These things being clear, I the rather make mention of them, to undermine divers usual objections againts the Membership, and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant-Interest of Children; as, that they have no saving Grace ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times; and that they make no actuall profession of any grace; and that many of them degenerate, and prove corrupt, and wicked <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for suppose all these, yet God may take them into outward Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant (which is sufficient to make them the Church-Seed, or Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Church) although he doth not receive them into inward Covenant, in bestowing upon them saving Grace, or Power to profess it, nay though they degenerate, and grow very corrupt after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Because you may question <hi>what this outward Covenant is,</hi> to which the seales are annexed; and under which we shall prove,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:96691:13"/>
Children are comprehended; and because the Knowledg of it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding usefull and very pleasant, I shall therefore give a short taste of it, as a light to our after-discourse, especially as it is considered in the largest extent of it. This outward covenant therefore consists chiefly of these three branches, or speciall promises:</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>The Lord engageth himselfe to them, that they shall be called by his Name, or is Name shall be called upon them, as 'tis Isay.</hi> 63.19.

They may not be his Sons, and People really, and savingly, but God will Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour them outwardly (at least) with this name, and priviledg: they shall bear his name, to be called so, and consequently to be accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted so by others, and to be reckoned as of the number of his visible Church, and People; just as one that Adopts a young Son, he tel's the Father if he carry it well toward him when he is grown up to years, he shall possess the inheritance it selfe, but yet in the mean while be shall have this favour to be called his son, and be of his fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and houshold, and so be reckoned among the number of his Sons: <hi>

And <hi>Deut.</hi> 7.6. <hi>The Lord hath chosen you, above all people on the earth, to be a special people to himselfe, and thou art an holy people unto the Lord:</hi> How a holy people? by inward holiness? no verily, for many of them were inwardly unholy, both Parents and children, but thou art <hi>holy, i. e.</hi> thou art externally sanctified, and set apart by special meanes of holiness, to be a special people unto God. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Isay</hi> 5.7. <hi>the men of Iudah</hi> are called Gods <hi>pleasant plant: i. e.</hi> planted into the root and fatness of the Church, and therefore had all meanes used for their further special good, <hi>verse</hi> 4. <hi>What could bee done to my vineyard, that hath not been done?</hi> And hence it is, that though the word may come to heathens as well as Church-mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, yet it comes not to them <hi>by way of Covenant,</hi> as it doth to Church-members; nor have they any promise of mercy aforehand, as Church-members have; nor is it <hi>chiefly</hi> belonging to such, but unto the children of the Covenant &amp; the promise, as hath bee said. And hence also it follow's that God never cutt's off the seed of his Servants from the special benefits of the Covenant until they have had the meanes thereunto, and they have positively rejected those meanes: and hence the Jewes (who are made the Pattern of what God will do toward all Gentile-churches, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.) were never cast off till by positive unbelief they provoked the Lord to break them off, by rejecting and refusing the meanes of their eternal peace</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>The Lord promiseth, that the seed of his people (indefinitely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered) shall have this heart (viz: which would refuse special grace, and mercy) taken away,</hi> as well as meanes used for that end: this is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:96691:14"/>
from <hi>Deut.</hi> 30.6. <hi>The Lord thy God will Circumcise thy heart and the heart of thy seed, to love the Lord:</hi> he will cut off the uncircumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, and sin, and resistance of the heart against God; he will <hi>take away the stony heart</hi>: not indeed from all, in outward Covenant <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly</hi>; but from these <hi>indefinitely</hi>; so that there is no promise to do this for any out of the visible Church, (though God of his Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty, and free mercy somtimes doth so) but the <hi>promise</hi> of this <hi>belongs</hi> indefinitely to those of his Church, among whom usually, and ordinarily he worke's this great work, leaving him to his own freeness of secret mercy, to work thus on whom he will, and when he will: in the mean while no man can exclude himself, or any others within this Covenant from hope of this mercy, and grace, but may with comfort look and pray for it; for <hi>this is Gods Covenant that the Redeemer shall come out of Sion, and turn away ungodlyness from Iacob, Rom.</hi> 11.26, 27. for the Covenant of God doth not only run thus; If thou believe and receive grace thou shalt have it; but thus also, I will Circumcise your heart, I will take away the stony heart, I will turn away ungodliness form you, I will enable to believe: And hence these three things follow from these things thus opened.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That as the Covenant run's not only thus, viz. <hi>If thou believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est thou shalt be saved,</hi> but also <hi>I will enable to believe;</hi> So a mans entrance into Covenant is not only by actual and personal professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Faith [as some say] because God's Covenant run's a peg high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, <hi>viz</hi>: to make and enable some to believe, and so to make that profession.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That the very outward Covenant is not <hi>meerly conditional,</hi> but there is something <hi>absolute</hi> in it: and hence it follow's, that it is a great mistake of some who think that Circumcision, and Baptism, seal only conditionally [the outward Covenant being <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>say they] meerly conditionall] for those three things mentioned in the outward Covenant you see are in some respect absolute, and if the Covenant was only conditionall, then the Lord was no more in Covenant with Church-Members, than with pagans, and infidels, for it may be propounded conditionally to all such, that if they believe, they shall be saved, but assuredly God's grace is a little more extensive to the one, then to the other.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:96691:15"/>3 Hence you may see what <hi>Circumcision</hi> once did, and <hi>Baptism<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi> now <hi>seal's</hi> unto, even to Infants the seal is to confirm the Covenant: the Covenant is, that God (outwardly at least) owne's them, and rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon's them among his people, and Children, within his visible Church and Kingdome, and that here upon he will prune, and cutt, and dresse, and water them, and improve the means of their eternal good upon them, which good they shall have, unless they refuse in resisting the means; nay that he will take away this refuseing heart from among them indefinitely, so that though every one cannot assure himself, that he will do it particularly for this or that person, yet every one, through this promise, may hope, and pray for the communication of this grace, and so feel it in time.</p>
            <p>These things thus premised, to clear up the ensuing discourse, I shall now do two things. 1. Leave a few grounds and reasons to prove, <hi>that Children are in Church-Covenant, and so enjoy Church-Membership by their parents.</hi> 2. I shall then <hi>Answer your scruples.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>To the first</hi>; The truth of it is manifest, by clearing up this propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition; <hi>viz:</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Argum:</hi> 1.</note> 
               <hi>That one and the same Covenant which was made to Abraham in the old Testament, is for substance the same with that in the New; and this under the new-Testament, the very same with that of Abraham's under the old.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>I say for Substance</hi> the same, for it is acknowledged that there was somthing <hi>proper</hi> and <hi>personal</hi> in <hi>Abraham's</hi> Covena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, as <hi>to be a Father of many Nations,</hi> but this was not of <hi>the Substance</hi> of the Covenant, which belong's to all the Covenanters, and unto which the <hi>Seal of Circumcision</hi> was set: for all Abraham's seed, neither in those, nor these dayes, are the fathers of many nations, nor did Circumcision seal it.</p>
            <p>Again it is confessed, that the <hi>external administrations</hi> of this one &amp; the same covenant, are diverse; but still <hi>the Covenant for substance</hi> is the same: For that old covenant was dispensed with other external signes, sacrifices, types, prophesies, then this under the new. There was something Typical in Abraham's covena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t concerning <hi>Canaan,</hi> a type of heaven, but yet the same Covenant remaine's now with a more naked manner of dispensation, or promise of heaven. And hence it follow's, that if it may appear, that the Covenant it self is one and the same, now, as then; then, as now; then it will undeniably
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:96691:15"/>
follow, that if the New Covenant under the Gospel be not a <hi>carnal</hi> Covenant, no more was that: if the new-Covenant be not proper to Abraham's <hi>natural seed,</hi> no more was that which was made with A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham: if the substance of that Covenant was, <hi>I will be a God to thee and thy seed,</hi> then this very Covenant remaine's still under the Gospel, it being one and the same with that; if by vertue of that Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, the Children were made <hi>Members of the Church</hi>; and hence had a Church priviledge, and seal administred; then the same Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant remaining the same, and in the same force, and benefit, <hi>our Children</hi> also are taken into <hi>the like Membership.</hi> It remaine's ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to prove that which all our Divines have long since made good against the Papists, <hi>that the Covenant then, and now, is for substance one and the same</hi>; or that the Covena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t made with Abraham was a Gospel-Covenant, and this Gospel-Covenant the same that was made with Abraham.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>The Covenant made with Abraham is renewed in the Gospel,</hi> as to the main thing in it, <hi>viz: I will be their God, and they shall be my people, Heb.</hi> 8.10. <hi>Ier.</hi> 31.33. and though <hi>the seed</hi> be not exprest, yet its understood, as 'tis <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.8. &amp; if need be shall be proved hereafter.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Because Abraham's Covenant is of Gospel &amp; eternal priviledges.</hi> Not proper therefore to him, and his fleshly posterity. For <hi>righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness by Faith</hi> was sealed up by Circumcision <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.11. which is a Gospel priviledge, and is the ground of all other priviledges, and yet in <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.7. there is no expression of this righteousness by Faith, but it is understood therefore in this, I will be their God: So the promise of eternal life, and resurrection therunto is wrapt up in this, <hi>I am the God of Abraham, Isaac and Iacob.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Because there was never any Covenant, but it was either of Grace; or workes</hi>: that of workes on mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> that of Grace which was made with <hi>Abraham</hi>: and hence <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.17. <hi>The Covenant which was confirmed afore by Christ, the Law</hi> 430 <hi>years after cannot disanull:</hi> and what was that Covenant before? surely it was the Covenant of <hi>Grace,</hi> becaus it was confirmed by <hi>Christ:</hi> and what was this Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant confirmed by Christ, but the Covenant made with <hi>Abraham?</hi> for of this the Apostle speakes, verses 14, 16. And he cal's it express<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by the Name of <hi>Gospel,</hi> or the Gospel-Covenant, verse 8, 9.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:96691:16"/>4. Because <hi>when God reneweth his promise and Covenant made with Abraham, with his people at the plaines of Moab,</hi> Deut. 30.6. it run's in these words, <hi>viz: I will Circumcise thy heart, and the heart of thy seed,</hi> now this is a <hi>Gospel priviledg,</hi> and a <hi>Gospel-Covenant</hi>: as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares by comparing this text with <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.8. wherin <hi>the righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of faith,</hi> or the Gospel, is brought in speaking the words of this Covenant, saying <hi>the word is nigh thee, in thy heart &amp; mouth, Deut.</hi> 30.11, 12, 13, 14. Now if that place, Gen. 17.7. should be said to be obscure concerning the promise [I will be a God to thy seed] yet here in this place God speak's plainly, which by comparing the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures is a Gospel promise, and of a Gospel priviledge and therefore to be preach't by Ministers of the Gospel, and to be believed by the professors of it.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>Because this promise</hi> [I will be a God to thee and thy seed] <hi>doth not belong to Abraham &amp; his seed as after the flesh,</hi> or as lineally descend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of Abraham: <hi>but as believers,</hi> and this is most evident <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. wherein 'tis said of the Jews, 1. That they were <hi>broken off,</hi> (made no people, no Church) <hi>by unbeliefe,</hi> verse 20. 2. That by <hi>Faith</hi> they shall be graffed in again, verse 23. If therefore they were bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken off the Church by <hi>unbeliefe,</hi> then they stood as members of the Church by <hi>Faith:</hi> and if by faith they should be graffed in, then they stood by faith at first: Again it is said in this <hi>Rom</hi> 11.28. that they are <hi>loved for the Fathers sakes,</hi> surely not as <hi>natural</hi> fathers, but as <hi>spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual by faith</hi>: and hence <hi>Nehem.</hi> 9.8. it is expressly said, that <hi>God found Abraham faithfull before him,</hi> and made a Covenant with him.</p>
            <p>Again if the posterity of Abraham were Members upon this ground only or chiefly, <hi>viz.</hi> because they were <hi>lineally descended of Abraham,</hi> then <hi>Esau, Ishmael, the Iewes Rom.</hi> 11.20. could never have been cast off from being Members of the Church, because they were alway the natural off-spring &amp; posterity of Abraham. Hence therfore it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low's that if they were ingraffed in the Church <hi>as Believers</hi> (the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers as actually believing the Children as sett apart by promise of God to be made to believe and in their Parents Faith accounted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers) then all believers at this day have the same priviledg, and the Covenant then being made only in respect of Faith, must needs be Gospel Covenant, the same with God's Covenant at this day. And
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:96691:16"/>
hence also it follow's that if they were Members as Believers, then not as Members of that nation. They were not therefore members of the Church, because they were descended of Abraham, and were in a national Church, and were by generation Jews. Circumcision was a Seal of Righteousness by Faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 11. therefore they were sealed as believers.</p>
            <p>Thus much for the first argument, wherein I have been the larger, because much light is let in by it, to answer divers mistakes I shall name the rest with morerbrevity.</p>
            <p>Argum: 2. <hi>If it was the curse of Gentiles, to be strangers to the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants of promise (made with the Iews) before they became the Churches of God; then by being Churches, this Curse is removed</hi>; and hence <hi>Ephe.</hi> 2.12, 13. The Apostle saith they <hi>were strangers to the Covenant,</hi> and <hi>Common-wealth of Israel,</hi> but are not so now. If you lay that the <hi>Ephesians</hi> were in Covenant, but not their seed, and so they were not strangers? <hi>I Answer</hi> that the Apostle doth not set out their cursed estate meerly because they were without <hi>any Covenant,</hi> but because they were strangers to <hi>that Covenant</hi> of promise which the <hi>Israelites</hi> had; for if their children had it not, they were then as without Covenant, so without God, and without hope, as Pagans are, which is notoriously cross to the current of all Scripture, as may afterward appear.</p>

Suppose therefore (as you imagine) that all the houshold, whether prophane or holy, were to be received into the Covenant, and so to the seal of it, do you think that this course of admitting all prophane persons then, would not make the Lord soon weary of, and angry with those family-churches, as well as of national, or congregational now, upon the like suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition? if therefore any servants born in the house, or hired, were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, surely they were not such unholy ones, whom the Lord could not but be as much angry with, then as now; but they were godly and holy at least in outward profession, upon which ground the Lord commanded them to be <hi>Circumcised.</hi>

Why not?</hi> for if there be any strength in this Argument, it holds as strongly against the admission of professing visible believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers: where, though all are <hi>externally,</hi> and federally holy, yet some, yea many, yea the greatest part of such may be <hi>inwardly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ad,</hi> and as prophane in their hearts, as Esau: and must we therefore refuse them to be Church-members because many of them may be inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bad? verily there must then never be Churches of God in this world. So 'tis among children, they are all outwardly holy, yet many of them may be inwardly unholy, like Esau, must we not therfore accept them to Membership? It is a miserable mistake to think that inward reall holyness is the only ground of admission in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Church-Membership, as some <hi>Anabaptists</hi> dispute, but it is fede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral holyness, whether externally professed as in grown persons, or gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciously promised unto their seed.</p>
            <p>Reply 1. <hi>But you here Reply, If so, then they are of the Church when they are grown up, and prophane, untill they are cast out</hi>: and to take in prophane, is sinfull, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 44.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ. It is very true</hi>; For 'tis herein just as 'tis in admitting profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing believers, they may prove prophane, and continue so in Church-membership, untill they are cast out; but is this therefore any ground to keep out those who are personally holy by their own profession? no verily, why then should such as are parentally, and federally holy be kept out from Church-Membership because they <hi>may prove pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane,</hi> and being prophane must <hi>remain Church-Members</hi> till they be cast out.</p>
            <p>Reply 2 <hi>But then (you say) they must be Church-Members though their Parents themselves, and the whole Church be unwilling thereunto,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:96691:19"/>
even as (say you) a man that marrieth a woman, her children must be his, and he be a Father to them, though he and she, and they should say <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> This similitude of marriage doth neither prove, nor illust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate the thing; For the relation between father and such children is absolute &amp; natural, and hence continues though they say he shall not be their father, and though he profess he will not; but the relation founded upon Church-covenant, between member and member, is not natural, not only, and allway absolute; but also con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionall, which condition not being <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>1. So 'tis with all Gentile Churches, and the members thereof: &amp; as for that which you last say, That <hi>they may refuse their Parents Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant at age, as well as own i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>, and so may members go out at pleasure,</hi> which is disorder. <hi>I answer,</hi> That the like may be said of such members as come in by personal profession, for they may renounce their own Covenant with God and the Church, one may doe so, and so may twentie, yet though this be wickedness and disorder, yet the Church may proceed against them, and so it may against their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, who are bound to own the Covenant made with God, and of God with them in their Parents, as well as any Church-Members are to own their own Covenant by their own personal profession. What disorder therfore will come in as you conceive this way will come in by your own way, and what course you should take to heal the one, by the same you may heal the other.</p>
            <p>Object. 3. <hi>If Children (say you) be members; then their seed suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessively, untill they be either dissolved, or excommunicated; and if so, then what Churches shall we have?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. What Churches shall we have? Truely not allway Churches of Angels and faints, but mixt with many chaffy hypocrites and oft times prophane persons.

            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. Yes verily, there is a plain difference between member and member (though professing believers) in point of priviledge, though they lie under no sin: for, a <hi>man</hi> may speak and prophesy in the Church, not <hi>Women.</hi> A company of <hi>Men</hi> may make a Church, and so receive in, and cast out of the Church, but not <hi>Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi> though professing Saints.</p>
            <p n="2">2. All grown men are not to be admitted (though professing Believers) to the <hi>Lords Supper</hi>; my reason is; A man may Believe in Christ, and yet be very ignorant of the nature, use, and ends of the Lords Supper, now such may be <hi>Baptized</hi> as soon as ever faith appeares, <hi>Mark</hi> 16.16. but they may not be admitted to the <hi>Lords Supper,</hi> because they will be <hi>guilty of the body and blood of the Lord,</hi> if they through their ignorance, cannot <hi>discern the Lord body.</hi> I know no reason but ignorant persons may be as well suspended from the use of this priviledge, though they be true believers (for faith may consist with much ignorance) as well as distracted persons, who not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding may be believers also.</p>

A child may receive a promise aforehand of a rich estate given him, and this promise sealed up to him, his father receiving it for him, but it is not fit that he should be put to the actual improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and fruition of that estate, untill he is grown up, understands himselfe, and knows how to do it: so 'tis here, the Sacrament of the Lords Supper requires ability, 1. To take Christ as our own. 2. To eat Christ, that is, to take fruition of him: the which acts of saith, God doth not require of all those immediately, who are wrapt up in Covenant with him.</p>
            <p>Object. 1. <hi>But here you say, that that examination</hi> 1 Cor 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>is required of all that be members, and that at all times, as well as their first comming to the Lords Supper.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> This examination is indeed required of all those members who should partake of the Lords Supper, but it is not required (as you seem to say) of every one to make him a <hi>member,</hi> so that none can be a member, but him that is able to examine himselfe; for Gods Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant to work faith, and to give power to examine one's selfe after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, may make some as truely members as those who are able to act &amp; express their faith. Now I have proved that Gods Covenant is a forehand given to children: and to give them the seal of their first entrance into it many yeares after, is as vile a thing, as for them that are able, and fit to examine themselves, to have this Sacrament of the Lords Supper denied, or delaied till many yeares after.</p>
            <p>Object. 2. But you say, <hi>It's left to every ones conscience to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine himself, not that others should examine them, and consequently if children be members, thou it must be left upon their conscience.</hi>

               <hi>Answ.</hi> We know in our own consciences that Children usually cannot examine themselves, now if the Elders &amp; the Church are bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to see Christs rules observed by others, and if this examination be the rule that all must walk by who participate here, then they must not suffer such yong ones, no nor persons grown up, and entred in by personal profession, to receive this seal, as they know are unable thus to do: I think if Churches should degenerate in these dayes, this course of Discipline should be attended (especially by <hi>the Elders</hi>) to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward any of their members, which way soever they have entred, whether by their own, or by their parents covenant: And I have oft feared that there is some need already of it, even toward some who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter by their own covenant, and may have faith, but are miserably to seek in the <hi>nature, use, and ends of the Lords Supper,</hi> and consequently unfit to <hi>d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Object. 5. <hi>If Children may be members, &amp; yet not come to the Lords Supper: then it may come to pass that a whole Church may be a Church, and yet not have the Lords Supper, or ought not to have it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. So there may, for a Church may be a true Church, &amp; yet want the benefit of some one or more of Gods Ordinances, sometime <hi>Pastors,</hi> sometime <hi>Elders,</hi> sometime <hi>Seales.</hi>

            <p n="2">2. A Church of professing Believers may degenerate, and turn prophane, and sottish, and so have no just right to the Seales; and their Officers may leave them, and so have no use of the <hi>Seales</hi>: yet I suppose it is a Church of Christ still though degenerate, though unfit to enjoy <hi>Seales</hi>; will you therfore think the way of <hi>their Membership</hi> unlawfull, <hi>viz.</hi> by professing their Faith?

thoughts</hi> of Faith, as Children, and Sons of God by promise, as I have shewn. And I think herein is our great sin, as it was in Christ's own <hi>disciples,</hi> who were the first, that we read of, that would not have <hi>lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Children brought unto him,</hi> for which he rebuked them, shewing their priviledge; and for want of which faith in Gods promise about our children, certainly God smites, and forsakes many of our children.</p>
            <p n="2">2. If therefore you think that Church-members must consist on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of saints by calling; so that your meaning is, such saints as are so <hi>by outward and personal profession, from the call of the Gospel,</hi> are only to be Church-members; this is an errour: For, 1. You know that they who define a Church to be a number of visible saints, they usually put this phrase in, [<hi>and their s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The outward Covenant is not all way first entred into by personal profession of faith, but by Gods Covenant of promise to work, or to use the meanes to work faith: Hence it undeniably follows; that as many may be in Church-covenant before they profess faith personally, so many may be members of the Church without this profession of faith; for this Covenant of working faith (as hath been formerly explained) doth not only belong to the Jews, but to Gentile Churches also, and Believers; as hath been proved, and might further be confirmed.</p>
            <p>Object: But say you, <hi>If we saw hypocrites, we were to cast them out as well as prophane persons: and we see no grace in many children, and therefore they must not be received in.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. If you see children, of whom you cannot say that they are faithfull personally, yet they may be faithfull federally (as hath been shewed) for they may lie under Gods Covenant of begetting faith, by some meanes in them; and then you are not to cast them out, but accept them, as God doth.</p>

Now hypocrites are such as profess Christ in words, and yet deny Christ in deed, <hi>Titus</hi> 1.16. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.5. Hence they are such, as positively re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse Christ: hence the case of children in whom <hi>no positive unbeliefe</hi> appeares, is not the same with this of hypocrites, or prophane per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons; and when young Ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Quest. 1. <hi>What good (say you) is it, either for a wicked, or an elect Child, till he be converted, to be in the Church? or what good may any have by being in the Church, till they can profit by what they enjoy?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> 1 The Apostle put's the like case, and gives you an Answer <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.1, 2. <hi>what advantage hath the Iew, and what profit is there of Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision?</hi> what use or profit could the Infants then make of their Church-Covenant, Membership, or Seal, who understood none of these things? do you think the Lord exposed his holy ordinances then unto contempt? and is more carefull that they may be profitably used now? was there no good by Circumcision? yea saith the Apostle, <hi>much every way.</hi>

I will only hint unto you some few of my many thoughts, which have long exercised me for many yeares in this thing. The <hi>good</hi> by childrens <hi>membership,</hi> especially when <hi>Sealed,</hi> is in four things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>In respect of God.</hi> God shews hereby the riches of <hi>his grace</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward them, in <hi>taking them to be his people: In Adopting them to be his children: In preventing them with many special promises aforehand of doing them good,</hi> by all which, the Lord doth as it were <hi>prevent Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan,</hi> in wooing their hearts as it were, so soon to draw them to him before he can actually stirr to draw their soules from him. So that I beseech you consider, suppose they cannot as yet understand, and so make profit by all this, yet is it not good for them, or for any of us to partake of Gods grace, before we know how to make use of it? is it not good for God to be good to them that are evil? is it not good for God to glorifie &amp; make manifest his grace to man, though man knowes not how to make use of his grace? was it not rich grace for <hi>Christ</hi> to wash <hi>Peters</hi> feet, and yet he not know at present what it meant, only (saith Christ) <hi>thou shalt know it afterward?</hi> is it not good for God to give life to us, and to let us be born in such and such a place of the Gospel where it is preached, and to lay in mercy aforehand for us, before we know how to be thankfull, or know how to use any of these outward mercies? and is it no mercy or favour to have so much spiritual mercy bestowed on children a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forehand, before they can be thankfull, or make use thereof? <hi>Deut.</hi> 7.6, 7. The choosing of them to be his people, above all other people (which you know was from the womb) it's called <hi>Gods setting his Love upon them,</hi> and the reason of this Love, <hi>verse</hi> 8. is said to be,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:96691:23"/>
               <hi>because God loved them,</hi> this love was not Electing, &amp; peculiar love, (for thousands of these perished and went to hell) but it was his <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall adopting love</hi> to choose them to be his people, and to improve all means for their good, and to give them the good of all those means unless they refuse: and to give indefinitely among them, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly to many of them, such hearts as that they shall not be able to refuse the good of those meanes (as hath been shewed formerly) this is love, great love &amp; mercy; not shewn or promised to any who are not of the visible Church throughout the whole world. By which God is glorified, &amp; let him be so, though we cannot see how to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit by it, when it first break's out; Have not you profited much by considering Gods preventing grace, long before you understood how to make use of it? hath not God received much glory from you for it? hath this grace then think you, been unprofitably spent on Gods part? No verily: The case is the same here, David blesseth God, for <hi>being his God from his Mothers belly, and from the womb, Psal.</hi> 22.9, 10. and Gods grace is shewn through this expression, <hi>Isai.</hi> 46.3.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>There is much good hereby in respect of the Parents</hi>; for, suppose the children cannot profit by it, yet Parents may, and 'tis in respect of them very much that God looks upon their children, thus to receive them into Covenant, <hi>Deut.</hi> 4.37. For, 1. <hi>Parents may hereby see, and wonder at the riches of Gods grace,</hi> to become a God not only to themselves, but to take in their seed also, whose good they prize as their own, and as if done to themselves: hence <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham fell down upon his face,</hi> adoring God, when he heard of this Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. See also how <hi>Moses</hi> aggravates this love, in the eyes of all that had eyes to see, <hi>Deut.</hi> 10.14, 15. 2. <hi>Hereby God gives Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents some comfortable hope of their childrens salvation;</hi> because they be within the pale of the visible Church; for as out of the visible Church (where the ordinary meanes of salvation be) there is <hi>ordinarily</hi> no salvation, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.47. So if children were not of Christs visible Church and Kingdome, we could not hope for their salvation, no more then of Pagans, or Turks; for if they be <hi>without God,</hi> they are <hi>without hope, Ephes.</hi> 2.12. and to be without hope of such, to whom God hath made such promises of salvation, not given to Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans, nor proper to <hi>Abraham,</hi> is very hard, and horrid to imagine;
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:96691:23"/>
for the promise run's universally, that <hi>the Seed of the upright</hi> (whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Jews, or Gentiles) <hi>shall be Blessed. Psal.</hi> 112.1, 2. <hi>Prov.</hi> 20.7. 3. <hi>Hereby Parents are stirred up the more earnestly to Pray for them,</hi> because God's Covenant and promise is so large toward them, at which Prayer look's, and by which it wrestle's with God, and hence, we find that <hi>Moses,</hi> and others, they use this argument in their Prayers; oh <hi>God of Abraham, Isaac, and Iacob: &amp;c:</hi> 4. <hi>Hereby they may not only hope, and Pray, but are incouraged to Believe,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning their Children and the rest of those who are in Covenant a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, that God will do them good, as they conclude <hi>mercy to the remnant, forgivness of their sins,</hi> with faith, upon this ground, <hi>thou wilt remember the Truth to Iacob, and thy Mercy to Abraham, sworn unto our Fathers in dayes of old, Micah</hi> 7.18, 20. This indeed is the childrens faith for themselves, and their children: but so it may be a ground of Parents faith: And if we pray for our children, why should we doubt (leaving only secrets to God) if we see them dy before they <hi>reject</hi> the Gospel <hi>positively</hi>; I see no reason for any man to doubt of the salvation of his child if he dyes, or that God will not do good to his child in time if he lives. 5. <hi>This stirrs up their hearts to be the more sincerely holy, and keep in with God, because of their children: and to educate them with more care, and watchfullness,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they are the Lord's Children as well as theirs; they are not common, but holy vessels, and therfore let them see that they be not defiled; and hence we find, that when God exhort's to any duty of holiness in Scripture, he oft makes this the ground of it [<hi>I am your God</hi>] and hence God aggravates their sin in offering their children to <hi>Molech, Ezek.</hi> 16. because they were <hi>his children,</hi> that should have been better used.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>In respect of themselves, the good is very great.</hi> 1. It is a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial <hi>meanes to prevent sin, Deut.</hi> 29. <hi>I make this Covenant,</hi> not only with him that is present, but with your seed also, who <hi>are not here, verse</hi> 15<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Lest there should be among you man, or woman, family, or tribe, whose heart turnes away from God, and lest there should be a root of gall and wormwood:</hi> and indeed it mightily workes on the heart to think; shall I whom God hath chosen to be his, be my own; or be the Divels, or be my lusts &amp;c? 2. <hi>'Tis a strong motive &amp; en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement

upon them to forsake sin,</hi> even the uncircumcision and sin of their hearts, as is evident, <hi>Deut.</hi> 10.15, 16. <hi>The Lord had a delight to choose the seed of your fathers,</hi> even you to be his people, <hi>as it is this day</hi>: what follow's? <hi>Therefore Circumcise the foreskin of your hearts, and be no more stiff-necked</hi>: 3. <hi>'Tis a special help,</hi> as to avert their hearts from sin, so <hi>to convert &amp; turn them to God, &amp; to make them look toward God, that he would turn them,</hi> when perhaps they are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any hope (in other respects) of mercy, or of being able by any meanes they can use to turn themselves; this is evident, <hi>Acts</hi> 3.19. with <hi>verse</hi> 25. <hi>Repent and be converted, for you are the children of the Covenant, which God made with our fathers</hi>; this drawes their hearts, when they see, how <hi>God</hi> call's them to return, <hi>Ier.</hi> 3.22. <hi>Come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me ye back sliding children &amp;c: we c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>me unto thee, for thou art the Lord our God.</hi> When backsliding <hi>Ephraim</hi> could not convert him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, he cryes unto <hi>God,</hi> oh <hi>turn me<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and I shall be turned, for thou art the Lord my God, Ier.</hi> 31.18. which places cannot be meant of being their <hi>God</hi> only by internal Covenant, in giving to them the spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial benefits of the Covenant, for then they should be in Covenant with God and have remission of all their sins, &amp;c: before they were turned, or before faith? and therefore it's meant of being a God in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and external church-Covenant, which is no smal motive, and loadst one to Believe. And although many do not believe, and will not be turned, yet this Covenant is an high priviledge, and great fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, fitt in it self, to draw to God, though many believe not: and hence <hi>the Apostle</hi> saith, that the priviledge of the <hi>Iew</hi> is great, in having God's <hi>Oracles</hi> (which contain God's Covenant) <hi>committed</hi> to them, though <hi>some believe no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

Deut.</hi> 30.20. thou shalt cleave unto him, because <hi>he is thy life, and the length of thy dayes</hi>: he was not their life spiritually,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:96691:24"/>
and savingly, (for many thus exhorted, were dead, and in their sins) but federally, or in outward Covenant. 5. <hi>If they shall forsake, and break loose from God, and from the bond of his Covenant,</hi> and have (as much as in them lies) cast themselves out of Covenant, by their own perfidious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, &amp; breach of Covenant, that one would think now there is no more hope; <hi>yet it is a special meanes, to encourage their hearts to return again:</hi> even when they seem to be utterly cast off, and therefore it's said <hi>Ier.</hi> 3 1. <hi>though thou hast committed whoredome with many lovers</hi> (wherby the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant was broken) <hi>yet return unto me</hi>: so <hi>Deut.</hi> 4. <hi>If when you are scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered among the nations, and shall serve wood &amp; stone, and be in great tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, if from thence thou seek the Lord thy God, thou shalt find him, he will not forsake thee</hi>; and what is the reason of it? <hi>viz.</hi> his remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance <hi>of the Covenant with their fathers,</hi> for so 'tis <hi>Deut.</hi> 4.27, 28, 29, 30 31.

            <p n="4">4. <hi>In respect of others their good is very great</hi>; for, 1. now they may enjoy <hi>the special watch and care of the whole Church,</hi> which otherwise they must want. 2. They hereby have the more <hi>fervent Prayers of others</hi> for their good: and hence <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.1, 2, 3. we see how <hi>Paul</hi> upon this ground had great zeal in his prayers for the Jews, not only because his country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, but especially because to them did belong <hi>the Adoption, and Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants,</hi> &amp; they had gracious Fathers &amp;c. so <hi>Psal<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
