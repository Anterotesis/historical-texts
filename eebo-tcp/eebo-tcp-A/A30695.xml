         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HAT vertuous Cava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier Signor Sagredo, when he left England, preſented me with this Triumph
<pb facs="tcp:52285:3"/>
of his Country, which I here ſend your Lordſhip, but in another Tongue. With what ſucceſſe I have made it Engliſh, it is not for me to judge, ſince it is a vanity given to all men, who make ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, to think them good. What the worth of theſe is, you, my Lord, who have ſo refined a taſte, who know the nature and propriety of every thing, and underſtand Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian, as if you were born at Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, will be beſt able to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine.</p>
            <p>I need not tell your Lordſhip, who are ignorant of nothing, what a great difference there is in Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlating; that nothing is more eaſie,
<pb facs="tcp:52285:3"/>
and nothing more difficult. To tranſlate an Argument or Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, which conſiſts of matter, requires no more, than a command of the Tongue, into which one tranſlates; and a reaſonable under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of that, out of which one does it: So that any man ſo quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, if he want not judgment, may tranſlate ſuch things ſucceſſefully. But to turn a Poem, the beauty of which lies not in the matter, but in the words, in the aire and dreſſe, into another tongue, asks not judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment onely, but invention too; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch that he ſhall never tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlate a Poem well, who cannot make one. Nor is judgment and
<pb facs="tcp:52285:4"/>
invention all, in doing it well there is a kinde of luck too, which will not fall under any rule; a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain felicity, which is given one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to ſome particular ſpirits. For the thoughts and deſigne of this piece, I am not to anſwer, ſince they are none of mine: If I have given it an Engliſh Genius, defa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced as little as may be the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, and native beauty of it, and put it into ſuch words, as Buſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nello would have done, if he had been an Engliſhman, it is all that can be expected from me.</p>
            <p>With the Engliſh, I have ſent your Lordſhip the Originall, that you may not onely judge, whether
<pb facs="tcp:52285:4"/>
it be well painted, but whether it be a faithfull Copy, and imitate the Italian life. You will eaſily diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern, my Lord, where I have wrongd Buſenello, and where, if I have not wrongd him every where, I have done him right.</p>
            <p>I could have wiſhed, my Lord, that inſtead of ſending you the actions of other men to read, I might have read your own; I mean, thoſe great actions, of which you have all the ſeeds in your mind, and want nothing but a field to ſow them in, ſome noble occaſion to put them forth. That Courage, Judgment, Eloquence, Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of things paſt, Intelligence of
<pb facs="tcp:52285:5"/>
the preſent, Foreſight of the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, acquaintance with Books, underſtanding of Men, and a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius made for buſineſſe: To this, ſweetneſſe of Manners, a generous and obliging Nature, a taking Meen, that grace which diſtingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes a great Perſon in a Croud, and makes him regarded when he is by himſelf, when he has none of his train and followers about him; invincible Courteſie, inviolable Friendſhip, and perfection in that great Science, which is ſo little un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, of Offices and Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ertues, my Lord, which in <hi>Rome</hi> would have made you a Conſul, and baniſhed you, if you
<pb facs="tcp:52285:5"/>
had been born in Athens. No tumor, no grimneſſe, nothing di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to ostentation, but all natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, and uncounterfeited Vertue. But amongſt ſo many great quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, it is not fit I ſhould forget that, which is an ornament to all the reſt, your Lordſhip's Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, which it may be will be offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded at this licenſe which I have taken to commend you, though I have ſaid nothing, but what you, my Lord, muſt needs be conſcious of: For though they, who have the moſt merit, have alwaies the leaſt arrogance, they cannot want an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward aſſurance of their own worth, and ſatisfastion in it, which is the
<pb facs="tcp:52285:6"/>
great reward wherewith Vertue paies her followers, and ſuſtains the minde, when the applauſe of men, the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours of fortune, and all things without us, fail us.</p>
            <p>What ever opinion your Lordſhip has of this Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation, I am confident you will take delight in the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of it. For how can you, who have ſuch mighty inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to do great things, but be pleaſed to hear of them? How can a ſoul, ſo inflamed with the love of vertue, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce to ſee Vertue proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous? to ſee Art ſubdue
<pb facs="tcp:52285:6"/>
Power, and Conduct tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph over Advantage? In one reſpect, it may be, your Lordſhip may read this with ſome diſpleaſure, ſuch a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure, as would not let Themiſtocles ſleep, when he heard of the victories of Miltiades; a diſpleaſure a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſing from a generous emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, to think, that others ſhould have ſuch occaſions for the exerciſe of their ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, when you have none for yours: to think, that others ſhould ſpend their time, in procuring ſafety and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to their afflicted Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
<pb facs="tcp:52285:7"/>
and immortall glory to themſelves, when you ſit with your arms folded, in a Cloſet, or a Garden, and waſte your Youth in the ſhade amongſt books and trees.</p>
            <p>Beſides the noble Perſons which are here celebrated, there is ſomething elſe, it may be, that will entertain your Lordſhip. I imagine, you will be pleaſed to hear Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenello diſcourſe to Libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri, the rareneſſe of his art, and the incredible things that are done by Painting; to ſee ſuch a deſcription of
<pb facs="tcp:52285:7"/>
Colours, expresſing Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to the life; and then Words with as great a life, expresſing thoſe Colours. Me thinks here is no ill Idea of thoſe two noble Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, Poeſy and Picture, the Sciences of Words and Colours. And which of them, my Lord, in your judgment, deſerves to be preferd? which of them, ſhall we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, imitates Nature beſt? and which has the advantage of the other, ſilent, or talking painting? But I will leave your Lordſhip with Buſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nello,
<pb facs="tcp:52285:8"/>
to determine that queſtion, and beg pardon for my confidence in this Addreſſe. If I have done ill to engage the name I moſt honour, in the protection of a Stranger, who it may be, through my miſrepreſenting him, will be but ill received, I know your Lordſhip will forgive me: My indiſcreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on cannot be ſo great, as your Generoſity: You, who have a goodneſſe to pardon injuries, will eaſily excuſe failings, eſpecially when they proceed from right in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions,
<pb facs="tcp:52285:8"/>
and from a heart ſo full of affection to your Perſon, and reverence to your Vertues, as that of</p>

            <l>THe winged Lion's not ſo fierce in fight,</l>
            <l>As Liberi's hand preſents him to our ſight:</l>
            <l>Nor could his pencil make him halfe ſo fierce,</l>
