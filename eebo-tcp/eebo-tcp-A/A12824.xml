         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Arguments fayle, the Examples of the greatest Emperors and
Generalls were sufficient, who in the midst of their Conquests,
thought their publike dutie not discharged, if they imployed
not some time, to leaue the immortall memory of their owne
actions by writing to Posteritie. The omission of this hath bin
a great defect of some ages foregoing ours, being the Middle
times betweene learned Antiquitie and this latter age, wherein
Language, Arts and Elegancie haue revived and flourished;
In those times though there haue been many, <hi>Qui fecerunt
scribenda,</hi> yet there were few, <hi>qui describerent facta.</hi> I dare
not say that this our. Age and Nation are guiltie of the like
errour or negligence, in deciphering to the life the occurrences

would relate them; A want of which many haue com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained,
but few haue laboured to supply. That which I now
in all humilitie present, is your Majesties by many Titles;
First, from the subject matter, being the finall Dispersion of
that cloud of Rebellion, which hath so long hung over that
Kingdome of <hi>Ireland,</hi> which by undoubted title, and lawfull
succession is descended to your Majestie, and that performed
by the prudent fortitude of the English Nation, which your
Majestie now so happily governes. Next, from your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties
late faithfull Servant, the Earle of <hi>Totnes,</hi> whose Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
are not the least part of the Argument of this Historie,
hee being at that time chiefe Governour of the Province of
<hi>Mounster,</hi> which was the Stage whereon the last and greatest
Scene of that Tragedie was acted, and since advanced by your
Majesties Royall Father and your selfe to many Honourable
Titles and Imployments of State. And lastly, from the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lisher,

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg>VT of a necessitie imposed by powerfull Custome
somewhat must bee sayd to you <hi>Reader,</hi> both to
prevent mistakings touching the publishing of
this VVorke, and to prepare you with some un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prejudicate
affection to the reading thereof. The
large space of time (thirtie yeeres and upwards)
betweene the matters Acted, Written, and now
published, may beget some wonder, in what obscure corner this
Worke hath lyen all this while, without notice given or taken; or
if knowne, why so long kept from publike view. For answere
heereto, understand indifferent Reader, that it was composed while
the Actions were fresh in the memories of men, by the Direction
and appoyntment of the Right Honourable Earle of <hi>Totnes</hi> (late
deceased) then Lord President of Mounster, so often mentioned in
this Historie. The Collection made, was by him first reserved for
his owne private Information; Secondly, preserved for the furthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of a Generall Historie of that Kingdome of <hi>Ireland,</hi> when it
should please God to raise up some industrious Writer to undertake
a compleat Description of those Affayres; And lastly, out of his
retyred Modestie, the rather by him held backe from the Stage of
Publication, lest himselfe being a principall Actor in many of the
particulars, might be perhaps thought, under the Narration of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
proceedings, to giue vent and utterance to his private merit and
Services, howsoever justly memorable. He leaving the world, left it
among his Papers, where it was found by the now Publisher there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
to whom they were bequeathed, and by whom it hath beene
offered to the view and censure of divers learned and judicious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons:
By them it hath been esteemed worthy the view of the
world, that those of present and future times, who desire not to be
strangers to what hath passed, and been acted at home, may receiue
true Information heereby. In confidence whereof, I presume that
whether you bee English or Irish that shall reade this Historie, you
shall finde much matter of contentment to advance the Honour of
both Nations: If English, behold the most dangerous and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>growne
Rebellion that ever was since the Kings of this Land were
Lords of that Isle, suppressed by the puissant valour of thy victorious
<pb facs="tcp:18000:6"/>
Countreymen, and a powerfull Invasion of a braue and warlike
Nation repulsed, and sent home to their Natiue Land: Or if you
bee of that other Nation, you may obserue the loyall fidelitie of the
greater part to their lawfull Prince, though animated to disloyaltie
by the strongest perswasions of their supreme Spirituall Pastor, with
promises of heavenly reward. Heere also you may behold a fatall
period given to the Rebellious Insurrections, under whose burthen
that Countrey hath groaned some hundreds of yeeres, and a firme
and assured Peace established to the comfort of them and their po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steritie.
And whether English or Irish, forget not (next after the
right hand of the most High bringing mi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>htie things to passe) to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
the Prudence, Courage, and Felicitie of that late Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne,
who in her deepe and declining age, did seale up the rest of
all her worthy Actes with this accomplishment, as if shee had
thought that her taske would bee unfinished, and Tombe unfur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished,
if there could not be deservedly engraven thereon, <hi>PACA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TA HIBERNIA;</hi>
The lot whereof was cast, and fell happily
on our side, by the prosperous successe of those Preparations and
Encounters which befell this short time of about three yeeres, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
by way of Annalls and Iournalls in this present Narration;
whereto thou must adde the like acknowledgement of the Wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
care, and provision taken by our late Soveraigne of blessed
memory King <hi>Iames,</hi> in the establishment not onely of Peace, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
of good Lawes and Iustice there flourishing, and continued by
the Providence and Piety of our present Soveraigne King CHARLES,
the true Inheritor of his renowned Fathers Vertues as well as King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes.
For the storie it selfe, it was collected, not out of flying ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours,
and popular tales, but (as the Title promiseth) out of the care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
and diligent Observations of the principall Actors in the servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
there related; And for the truth of their Reports, I hope it shall
receiue the Approbation of many Honourable and Worthy Persons
yet living, who may justly challenge a large portion of the honour
atchieved in those Warres. But I will detaine you no longer, (Iudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
Reader) but leaue you to the use of what is heere presented,
commending it and my selfe to your favourable censure.</p>

received their originall &amp; foundation in
the North, proceeded like unto a strong
poyson, which having infected one
member, without speedie prevention,
doth spred the contagion over the whole
bodie; for the Irish perceiving the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperous
successe of those first Rebels, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
beyond all expectation and hope (of
those that were ill affected) and that her
Majesties Forces had sustained many disasters, which were never
feared untill they happened, the neighbour Provinces of Connaght,
and Leinster, following the current of the present time, begin to
dismaske themselues of that cloake of subjection, which before they
pretended, and to shew themselues partakers in that wicked action,
and furtherers of the rebellion. And these being united in a strict
Combination, did verily perswade themselues, that it would bee a
matter very feasible, to enable them to shake off the English Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
and to make themselues absolute Commanders of all Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
if the chiefe Lords of Mounster, with their friends and follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
would joyne with them, to banish the English out of that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince.
They did account that Province to bee the key of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
both by reason of the Cities and walled Townes (which are
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:18000:12"/>
more then in all the Island besides) the fruitfulnesse of the Country,
being reputed the garden of Ireland, and the commodious Harbors,
lying open both to France and Spaine. They devised many plots,
cast many projects, and used many perswasions, to animate the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincials
to begin to enterprise. But <hi>currenti quid opus est calcaribus?</hi>
they were not so ready to yeeld reasons, as those were to heare; and
their eares no more open to heare, then their hearts to consent; and
their hands nothing backward in the execution thereof.</p>
               <p>The Earle of Essex at his being in Ireland with his Army,<note place="margin">Devoreux.</note> made a
journey into Mounster, in hope to compose the troubles thereof; all
that he performed at that time, was the taking of <hi>Cahir</hi> Castle, and
receiving the Lord of <hi>Cahir,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Butler.</note> and the Lord <hi>Roche,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Roche.</note> with some others
into protection. Who after his departure did either openly partake,
or secretly combine with the rebells againe.</p>
               <p>Her Majestie being resolved to send a new Lord Deputy into Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
made choise of a worthy and noble Gentleman endued with
excellent parts, as well of body, as minde, Sir <hi>Charles Blunt</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Blunt.</note> Lord
<hi>Mountioy.</hi> And at that time the Presidencie of Mounster being
voyd, by the unfortunate death of Sir <hi>Thomas Norris,</hi> lately slaine by
the rebels, shee made election of Sir <hi>George Carew</hi>

and the next day they rode to Dublin, where by the relation of the
Councell, they found a miserable torne state, utterly ruined by the
Warre, and the rebels swollen with pride, by reason of their manifest
victories, which almost in all encounters they had lately obtayned.
The President,<note place="margin">Carew.</note> although hee much desired to employ himselfe in his
government, yet he was enforced to make a long stay in Dublin, as
well to assemble the Forces allotted unto him, by order out of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land
(to bee in list 3000 Foot, and 250 Horse, which were dispersed
in sundry remote Garrisons) as to procure the dispatch of his Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions

under the great Seale of Ireland, which of custome is graunted to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very

and body, tyrannie &amp; ingratitude both to your followers and
country are inexcusable &amp; intolerable. You separated your selfe from
the unitie of Christs mysticall Bodie, the Catholike Church. You
know the Sword of Extirpation hangeth over your head, as well
as ours, if things fall out other wayes then well; you are the cause,
why all the Nobilitie of the South (from the East part to the West,)
you being linked unto each one of them, either in affinitie, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sanguinitie,
are not linked together to shake off the cruell yoake of
Heresie and Tyrannie, with which our Soules and Bodies are op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prest;
All those aforesaid depending of your resolution, and relying
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:18000:21"/>
to your Iudgement in this common cause of our Religion and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
you might forsooth with their helpe, (and the rest that are
combyned in this holy Action) not onely defend your selfe from the
incursion and invasion of the English, but also (by Gods assistance)
who miraculously and aboue all expectation, gaue good successe to
the cause principally undertaken for his glorie, exaltation of religion,
next for the restauration of the ruines, and preservation of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
expell them, and deliver them and us from most miserable and
cruell exaction and subjection, enjoy your religion, safetie of Wife
and children, life, lands and goods, which all are in hazard through
your folly, and want of due consideration: Enter I beseech you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

the end of your actions, and take advise of those that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     <head>The Lord Barries Answer to Tyrone.</head>
                     <p>YOur Letters I received, and if I had answered the same as right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
they might be answered, you should haue as little like ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
as I should mislike or feare any thing by you threatned against me;
(which manner of Answere, leaving to the construction and consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
of all those that are fully possessed with the knowledge of
the Law of duetie to God and Man.) You may understand hereby
briefly my mind to your obiections, in this manner; How I am
undoubtedly perswaded in my conscience, that by the Law of God
and his true religion I am bound to hold with her Maiestie: Her
Highnesse hath never restrained me for matters of religion, and as I
felt her Maiesties indifferencie and clemencie therein, I haue not spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to releeue poore Catholikes with duetifull succour, which well
considered, may assure any well disposed mind, that if duety had not
(as it doth) yet kindnesse and courtesie should bind me, to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
and requite to my power, the benefits by me received at her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iesties
hands: You shall further understand, that I hold my Lordships
and Lands, immediately under God, of her Maiestie and her most
noble Progenitors, by corporall service, and of none other, by very
ancient Tenour, which Service and Tenour, none may dispence
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:18000:22"/>
withall, but the true Possessor of the Crowne of England, being now
our Soveraigne Lady Queene <hi>Elizabeth.</hi> And though yee by some
over weening imaginations, haue declined from your dutifull allege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
unto her Highnesse; Yet I haue setled my selfe never to forsake
Her: Let fortune never so much rage against me, shee being my an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed
Prince, and would to God you had not so farre ran to such
desperate and erronious wayes, offending God and her Maiestie:
who hath so well deserved of you, and I would pray you, to enter
into consideration thereof, and with penitent hearts, to reclaime
your selues, hoping that her Highnesse of her accustomed clemency<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
would be gracious to you, wherein I leaue you to your owne com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punction
and consideration. And this much I must challenge you,
for breach of your word in your Letter, by implication inserted
that your forces haue spoiled part of my countrey, and preyed them
to the number of foure thousand Kine, and three thousand Mares
and Gerrans, and taken some of my followers Prisoners, within
the time by you assigned unto mee to come unto you, by your said
word, (if yee regarde it) I require restitution of my spoile, and Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners,
and after (unlesse you bee better advised<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for your Loyalty)
use your discretions against mee and mine, and spare not if you
please, for I doubt not with the helpe of God, and my Prince, to bee
quit with some of you hereafter, though now not able to use re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance:
And so wishing you to become true and faithfull Subiects
to God and your Prince, I end, at <hi>Barry Court</hi> this twenty sixe of

                     <head>A Ioint Letter from the Lord President and the Earle of
Thomond to the Lords of the Councell.</head>
                     <p>IT may please your Lordships: Although I the President haue by
my Letters advertised the Lord Deputie, the manner in what sort
the Earle of Ormond was taken, which I thinke is by his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
sent unto you, yet, wee thinke it our dueties to make relation
thereof unto your Lordships; and to make knowen unto your Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours,
how accidentally we were witnesses of his misfortune. On
Munday the seventh of <hi>Aprill,</hi> wee departed from <hi>Dublin,</hi> and upon
Wednesday at night wee came to <hi>Kilkenny,</hi> where wee found the
Earle of Ormond: In our company we had one hundred Horse, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>persed
in the Countrey ten or twelue miles distant from us, by the
Earles Officers: as soone as we came unto him, he acquainted us, that
he had appointed the next day to parlie with <hi>Owny Mac Rory,</hi> vvee
told his Lordship, that vve vvould attend him: And I the President,
desired his Lordship, that my one hundred Horse might be sent for
to goe vvith us, for his Lordships better guard, vvhich he refused,
thanking me for my offer,<note place="margin">The manner of the Earle of Ormonds taking.</note> saying that he had no need of them: The
next day being the tenth of this present<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> after Dinner his Lordship
not having in his company aboue the number of seventeene Horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
(of his followers) armed, and not little aboue the like num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of all sorts, whereof wee were part, and the rest Lavv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers,
Merchants, and others upon Hacknies, with no other
Weapons then our Swordes, roade out to the place of mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
eight long Miles from Kilkenny, called Corronneduffe,
upon the Borders of Ydough; Leaving his Lordships owne
Company of two hundred Footemen short (of the place of Parlie
assigned) aboue two English Miles; The place vvhere vvee
met with the rebells, was upon a Heath ground, descending towards
a narrow straight, having on either side of us a lowe shrubbie bog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie
wood, within three pikes length (at the farthest) from the place
where wee parlyed, and the like distance from the straight aforesaid,
the choyce whereof wee much misliked. <hi>Owny Mac Rorye</hi> when
hee came unto us, brought with him a Troupe of choise Pikes, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
in a little plaine beyond the straight, within halfe Culvering
shot of us, in our sight, all his grosse, beeing in all to the number (as
<hi>Redmond Keting,</hi> one of the rebells did sweare unto mee the Presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent

                        <pb facs="tcp:18000:24"/>

fiue hundred Foot strong, and twentie Horse, whereof three
hundred were <hi>Bonoughes,</hi> the best furnished men for the warre, and
the best appoynted that wee haue seene in this Kingdome. At our
first meeting, and so during the parley, (which was appoynted for
some good causes best knowen to his Lordship) they stood (as they
might) every one trayling his Pike, and holding the cheeke thereof
in his hand, ready to push. The Earle himselfe was upon a little
weake Hackney, unarmed (as all wee were that were about him)
standing so neere with the side of his Hackney to the rebells, as they
touched him. After an hower and more was idly spent, and nothing
concluded, wee and others did pray his Lordship to depart: But
hee desirous to see that infamous Iesuite <hi>Archer,</hi> did cause him to bee
sent for; assoone as hee came, the Earle and hee fell into an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
wherein hee called <hi>Archer</hi> Traytor, and reprooved him, for
sending, under pretext of Religion, her Majesties Subjects into re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion.
In this meane time the grosse of the rebells had left their
standing in the plaine, and some crept into the shrubbes aforesayd,
and others did so mingle themselues among us, that wee were envi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roned,
and stood as if wee had been in a Faire, whereof divers did
advertise his Lordship. And at last I the Earle of <hi>Thomond</hi> willed
<hi>Ownye</hi> to put backe his men: And I the President desired his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipp
to bee gone, for that I did not like their mingling with us;
wherewith as his Lordship was turning his Horse, at an instant
they seised upon him, and us two: His Lordship was in a moment
drawen from his Horse; we had more hanging upon us, then is cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dibly
to bee beleeved: but our horses were strong, and by that
meanes did breake through them, in tumbling downe (on all sides)
those that were before and behinde us, and (thankes be to God) we
escaped the push of their pikes, (which they freely bestowed) and
the flinging of their Skeines, without any hurt, saving that I the
Earle of Thomond received with a Pike a wound in the back. The
Earles Horsemen (which were armed) were farre from us, for eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
one was dispersed, and talking with particular rebells, about the
bordering businesse, so as wee doe protest unto your Lordships, in
all wee were not aboue tenne unarmed men neere unto him, and
assoone as the Allarme was raised, every man of his followers came
away, without <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ooking behind him: After wee had cleered our
selues (within a Butt length at the most) wee made hault, and called
for the Trumpet, and cried upon the Earles men for a Charge, but
none stood by us, but Captaine <hi>Harvy,</hi> Captaine <hi>Browne,</hi> Master <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merford,</hi>
a Lawyer, and three of our Servants, which was all the
company that we had then, and all of us, without Armour or other
Weapon then our Swords, so as for want of more company, vvee
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:18000:26"/>
were enforced by the Enemies shott, to leaue them the ground; But
we doe assure your Lordships, the place wherein we parlied was of
such advantage to the Enemy, that 500 Foote, would not haue cared
for 500 Horse, and therefore (his Lordship having no Foote with
him) it was unpossible to doe the Enemy any harme with Horse:
this treachery (for so wee must terme it in respect of his Lordships
confidence in the valour of his owne men, and also in his opinion
that the Enemy durst not shew him this foule measure) was contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by that Villaine <hi>Archer,</hi> and none was made acquainted with
it,<note place="margin">The narrow escape of the Lord Presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent.</note> but <hi>Owny Mac Rory,</hi> two Leinster men, and fower Bonnaghes, for
if more had beene trusted, there is no doubt but his Lordship should
haue had knowledge of it; <hi>Owny Mac Rory</hi> laid his hands on mee the
President, as they report, and (next unto God) I must thanke the
Earle of Thomond for my escape,<note place="margin">The Earle of Thomond wounded.</note> who thrust his Horse upon him,
and at my backe a Rebell newly protected (at my suite) called <hi>Brien
Mac Donoghe Kevanaghe</hi> being a foote, did me good service, and
wounded one of the Traitors, that laid hands on the Earle of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond,
for the rest I must thanke my Horse, whose strength bare
downe all about him. On our side there was but one man slaine,
not aboue fiue hurt, whereof <hi>Pierce Butler</hi> (a kinseman of the
Earles) was one, who behaved himselfe valiantly; and about foure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene
taken Prisoners; and of the Enemy was one slaine, and a few
hurt; the Prisoners were taken by their owne negligence, who were
grazing their horses: The taking of this great Lord breeds unsetled
humors in these parts, for all the Gentlemen of the countrey (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
some of them were his true followers) for want of a Defender
are wavering; others, which in their owne dispositions were
naught, and contained themselues as Subiects but for feare of his
power, are now at liberty, and we feare will shortly declare them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues:
<note place="margin">The order which was taken for the setling of the countrie af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Earle of Ormonds disaster.</note> To keepe them from present uproares, I the President, did
immediately send for sixe hundred Foote of the Mounster Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,
which were at Watterford, &amp; the hundred Horse, which were in
the countrey, to the Towne of Kilkenny, which hath wrought good
effect, and staied the unsetled humors; besides, thereby it did assure
the Lady of Ormond, and her daughter, which otherwise had beene
subiect to many dangers, so sorrowfull a Lady in all our liues vvee
haue not seene; and doe beleeue, that if it had not pleased God, that
we at that time, had beene there, she would hardly haue undergone
those griefes that did oppresse her: For besides the losse of her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
(in being Prisoner with those rogues) she beheld the apparant
ruine of her selfe and her daughter, and no lesse danger of both their
liues; the Guard vvhereof she committed unto us, not being assured
of those that serue her, for there is divers that pretend to bee the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:18000:26"/>
Earles Heires; First Sir <hi>Edmond Butler</hi> his second Brother, which
Sir <hi>Walter Butler</hi> the Earles Nephew, (whose blood is not attainted)
vvill not yeeld unto, because his Vncle Sir <hi>Edmond</hi> is not restored in
blood; And the Vicount <hi>Mountgarret</hi> thinks, that he ought to be Earle
of Ormond, for many reasons vvhich he pretends. This controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie
could not but breed great danger to the Countesse, and her daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
for that either of those vvould bee glad to possesse themselues in
the Earles houses, and the doubt vvho is to succeede him, breeds un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>setled
humors in the Gentlemen of the countrey, that bee follovvers
to the Earle, every one addicting himselfe to the partie they affect,
vvhereby there is a generall distraction vvhich vvould haue broken
out into a dangerous Rebellion, if the Forces and vve had not beene
heere to keepe them in awe: Besides we did not neglect to send for
all the Lords and Gentlemen in the countrie (that are of the best
quality) and haue temporized with them; So as we hope, the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
which were like to ensue, will be for a time well appeased: Also
understanding that <hi>Balliragget</hi> a house of the Lord <hi>Mountgarets,</hi> in
the which there is a Warde for the Queene, kept as a Pledge for his
loialty, that the same was attempted to be wonne by the Vicecounts
sonnes, who are in rebellion; And immediately upon the Earles ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king,
lay before it, in hope to starue the Souldiers, (for their last daies
victuals was spent) I the President did take up in Kilkenny, upon my
credit victuals, and with a strong convoy of Horse and Foote, haue
revictualled it, for sixe weekes, whereof the Lord Deputy is adverti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
praying him to be carefull, before that victuall be spent; And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
that all things might be continued in good order; We thought
good to remaine in Kilkenny, untill the Lord Deputy should deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
of some course, so to hold it for her Maiesties benefit, the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
good, and the Countesse and her daughters safetie; wherein
we were enforced to make large disbursements, of our small stores,
for dieting in that time of the horse and foote Troopes, whereof I
the Earle, defrayed the charges of my owne Company of two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Foote, and I the President of all the rest, during our abode
there, which was eight dayes. In this meane time wee understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
that <hi>Mountgarrets</hi> sonnes, (which are in rebellion) did come to
spoile the countrie neere to Kilkenny; We sent out some part of our
Troopes, who lighted upon some of their men; And amongst them
which they slew, there was one of the <hi>Butlers,</hi> a neere kinsman to
<hi>Mountgarret</hi> and a Leader slaine, and the Traitors driven to their
Woods, being enforced to leaue their enterprize.</p>
                     <p>The sixteenth of this present, Sir <hi>George Bourchier,</hi> and Sir <hi>Christo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher
S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Lawrence,</hi> sent from the Lord Deputie, came to Kilkenny, Sir
<hi>George</hi> for chiefe Commander of her Majesties Forces there, and to
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:18000:27"/>
take charge of the Countesse, her Daughter, and the Earles Houses,
and Sir <hi>Christopher</hi> to bee directed by him. The Forces there left is
two hundred Foote of the Earles, other two hundred Foote of Sir
<hi>Christophers,</hi> thirtie Foot left in a ward in <hi>Mountgarretts</hi> house, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Balliraggett,</hi> eightie fiue Horse, (whereof fiftie of the Earles, fiue
and twentie of <hi>St Lawrences</hi>) and tenne of Sir <hi>George Bourchiers.</hi>
Since the Earles taking, wee kept the Rebells from doing any hurt in
the Countrey, neither as yet is there any in rebellion in the same, but
<hi>Mountgarrets</hi> sonnes, whose force is not such, but in our opinions,
(without they call strangers to assist them) her Majesties Forces there
is much too strong for them. The seventeenth wee left Kilkenny,
and came to this Cittie, leaving Sir <hi>George Bourcheir</hi> as aforesaid.
This accident hath withheld mee the President from my peculiar
charge, more then I purposed, but therein I hope your Lordships
will hold mee excused, being other wayes so necessarily imployed
in these causes of so great importance; whereof I humbly beseech
your Lordshipps, in your wisedomes to haue due consideration.
To morrow wee proceed in our Iourney towards Corke, from
whence, (with the rest of the Councell there) wee will advertize
your Lordships, in what estate wee finde the Province, not being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
heere to certifie your Honours so particularly as then wee may.
So wee humbly take our leaues: From Waterford, the eighteenth
of Aprill,<note place="margin">18. April.</note> 1600. Strange it was to consider how much this mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune
distracted the minds of sundrie that before were inclined to
subjection, and greatly animated the Traitors to persevere in their
wicked enterprises, which might evidently be seene in <hi>Pierce Lacy,</hi>
a wise and malicious Traytor, who being but few dayes before up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Earles protection, promising great loyaltie and much service,
did presently relapse, and became a more dangerous Rebell then at
any time before. But now leaving farther discourse of former oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currents,
we will betake our selues wholly to prosecute the relation
of such things as happened in Mounster, after the Lord President
came to Waterford, which was the sixteenth of Aprill; For the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution
of the Service in which Province, by order out of England,
the List, as aforesayd for Mounster, was established to be three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
Foot, and two hundred and fiftie Horse. After his repaire thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
Intelligence came unto him, that the Titularie Earle of Des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond
with the greatest part of his Forces was remaining not farre
from Yoghall, about Drum<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Companies as hee had with him. <hi>Thomas fits
Iames,</hi> Bastard sonne of Sir <hi>Iames fits Gerrald,</hi> late Lord of the <hi>Decies,</hi>
and <hi>Thomas Power,</hi> the Lord <hi>Powers</hi> Cosen Ierman, the chiefe Rebels
in the Countie of Waterford, receiving advertisement that the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sident
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:18000:27"/>
was in Waterford, fearing peradventure lest some draught
might bee drawen upon them; and that themselues or followers
might receiue some great prejudice by meanes of the Presidents For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
made great instance by the Lord <hi>Power,</hi> and Sir <hi>Nicholas Welsh,</hi>
to be received into her Majesties protection, promising and prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting
not onely that they would reclaime themselues, and their fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers
from committing any outrage against her Majesties Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects;
but further, that they would indeavour to recompense and
requite their former defaults by some acceptable service. The Lord
President considering, that the receiving of them and their Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants
into protection, would bee a meanes both to weaken the
Traitour <hi>Desmond</hi> of some part of his strength, and to secure and
open the passage betwixt Waterford and Yoghall, which before was
so kept, especially by them, that there was no way to send but by
Sea: Vpon the best assurance that could bee gotten for their future
loyalties, accepted their submissions, and graunted protection both
to themselues and their followers, since which time they haue been
good and loyall Subjects.</p>

with a strange opinion of his worthinesse, and having combined
with <hi>Tyrone</hi> and the other Rebels at his late being in Mounster did
shew himselfe in open action against her Maiestie. Whereupon the

Captaine <hi>Flower</hi> and Captaine <hi>Bostocke</hi> into Carbery with twelue
hundred foote and one hundred horse (which <hi>Flower</hi> commanded in
chiefe) to make prosecution against the Rebels of those parts, in
their way towards Rosse, they burned and spoiled the Countrie as
they passed, they got the heads of thirty seven notorious rebels, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
others of lesse note: <hi>Florence</hi> gathered together of the Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cials
and Bownoghs (for so they call their waged men) to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of two thousand or thereabouts, <hi>Dermond Oconner,</hi> as Generall,
(for so they termed him) of the Bownoghs; These being gathered
to a head, attended their opportunity to giue some blow to our For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
yet never did encounter them, untill they were in their returne
within fiue Miles of Corke. In the mid way betwixt that Citie and
Kinsale, there is a foord &amp; a bridge, over the river called Awneboy.
Here the rebels lay close in an ambush on the North side of the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
in a glynn between two hils, and also on the South side, in a scrub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bie
Wood neere the river: The Companies comming on, not think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
there to expect an Enemy, marched scarce orderly, and but a few
maches burning, Captaine <hi>Iohn Bostocke,</hi> riding a good pretty di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
before them, and past the bridge, espied the Morians of some
of the suncke ambush in the Glinn, presently retiring backe gaue
notice of the Enemy, and willed them to prepare themselues. The
rebels finding that they were discovered, presently rose, and charged
our men before they were well ordered; Captaine <hi>Flower</hi> the
Commander finding himselfe opprest with numbers, drew to the
wals of an old ruinous Castle to the Eastward, neere halfe a mile
distant for his safety, in which retrait, they being upon the point of
routing, were charged home both with Horse and Foote. <hi>Flower</hi> to
prevent the danger, directed Lieuetenant <hi>Lane,</hi> officer to Sir <hi>Iohn
Barkley,</hi> to lie in ambush under an old ditch, with a squadron of
Musketiers; <hi>Carbry Oconner</hi> brother to <hi>Dermond</hi> aforesaid, came on
with his Company, following the execution of some of our men,
untill hee fell into the ambush, where hearing a volley of shot deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
upon them, <hi>Carbry</hi> with other Gentlemen were slaine; At
which accident the rebels being amazed, the Horse tooke the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity,
and chardged them with such resolution, as instantly they
rowted, and our men fell upon the execution of them: In which
Charge I cannot but particularly commend <hi>Robert Tent,</hi> Sir <hi>Anthony
Cooks Cornet,</hi> who did behaue himselfe with extraordinary valour:
besides <hi>Carbry Oconner,</hi> ninetie eight were slaine in the place, and
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:18000:28"/>
neere that number hurt, whereof divers afterwards died: On our
part, none of note hurt, but <hi>Greame,</hi> brother to Captaine <hi>Richard
Greame,</hi> and eight Souldiers: Captaine <hi>Flower,</hi> (who did that day
admirably well) had two Horses slaine under him, and received sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie
wounds, both with sword and pike, and it was his fortune to
encounter with <hi>Dermond O Conner,</hi> at whom hee discharged his Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoll,
which lighted upon his Targett, whereby he received no hurt.
That night they marched into Kinelmekagh, and encamped beyond
the Bridge of Balline Coursie, where they stayed with their hurt
men two nights; the third day in the evening they dispersed their
Companies to those Countries where they had Bonaught.</p>
               <p>The same day Captaine <hi>Francis Slingsby,</hi> Commaunder of the
Lord Presidents Foot Companie, and garrison at Kilmallock, where
there was the Lord Presidents two hundred Foot, Captaine <hi>Clares</hi>
one hundred and fiftie, twentie fiue of Sir <hi>Anthony Cooke</hi> his Troope,
and twelue of Sir <hi>George Thorntons</hi> Horse, drew foorth in the night,
part of that garrison, to take the prey of the Brough, a Castle of
<hi>Pierce Lacies,</hi> but three miles from Kilmallocke, to expect the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
foorth of the prey to grase,<note place="margin">The prey of the Brough taken.</note> which accordingly, about an hower
after day light came foorth, and they tooke it: Then presently the
crie being raised, three hundred Foot, and fiftie Horse led by <hi>Pierce
Lacie,</hi> skirmished with them for the space of sixe howers; but see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
they could not prevaile, they gaue over the pursuite: There was
slaine of our men, but one Horseman of Sir <hi>George Thorntons</hi>
Troope, and foure or fiue of the Lord Presidents Foote hurt;
their losses were more, whereof <hi>Con Oneale, Tyrones</hi> base sonne
was hurt.</p>
               <p>The three and twentieth at night the Lord President lodged at

came to Corke, upon the way being mett by Sir <hi>Henry Power,</hi> the
Commissioner of the Province, and the Captaines that there were
garrisoned. The first thing that the President intended (after hee
was come to Corke) was throughly to understand the state of the
Province, as then it stood; the greatest part whereof, although it
was knowen to him before, yet hee calling the Councell of that
Province together, desired to bee certified by them in the particulars
thereof, to the intent that hee might addresse his actions accordingly,
Sir <hi>Henrie Power</hi> being sole Commissioner (since the death of Sir
<hi>Warham S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Leger</hi>) reported the same much after this manner.</p>

Conquest of Ireland, this Province of Mounster was never more
distempered then now it is, for all the inhabitans of the countrey,
are in open and actuall rebellion, except some few of the better sort;
who though themselues in their owne persons attend the state, yet
all their Tenants, Friends, and Followers, yea and for the most part,
either their Sonnes or Brothers, publikely professed in the devilish
action; as for example, the Lord of Cahir, <hi>Cormocke Mac Dermond</hi>
Lord of Muskry, <hi>Gerald Fits Iames</hi> Lord of the Decies, <hi>Mac Carty
Keugh;</hi> The computation and number of the rebels, how many
they are, especially of the Province, by reason that they are dispersed
in so many severall countries, and commanded by so many heads,
we can giue no certaine iudgement, but for strangers (meaning Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naght
men that receiue bonnaght amongst them) we are certainely
advertised from divers, that are well acquainted with their affaires,
that they are in List fiue thousand men, which strength added to the
Rebells of the Province, doeth make them absolutely Masters of the
field, and her Majesties Forces heere garrisoned in Cities and wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
Townes for their safetie, (by reason of their weaknesse before
your comming) were in condition little better then besieged. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore,
all this might seeme more tollerable, if the Cities and wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
Townes were (in these times of extremitie) a safe and well assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
retreat for them: but all of them are so besotted and bewitched
with the Popish Priestes, Iesuites, and Seminaries, that for feare of
their Cursings and Excommunications, they are ready upon everie
small occasion, to rise in Armes against them, and minister all under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand,
ayde and succour unto the Rebells: so that considering the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neralitie
of the Inhabitants that are in open rebellion, the infidelitie
of those that pretend subjection, the multitude of Connaght men
that defend the Action, and the little confidence that may be reposed
in Cities, (by reason of their contrary religion) wee may very well
conclude, that the estate of this Province is like a man sicke of a most
dangerous and desperate disease.</p>
               <p>The Lord President having heard by his former advertisements
concerning the same matter, thus confirmed; He told the Councell
that hee much doubted of any good successe that could suddenly bee
expected, and the rather because his Forces were farre inferior to the
rebels, being in list but three thousand Foote and two hundred and
fiftie Horse: Yet remembring the old Proverbe, that <hi>Ardua virtutis
est via,</hi> and relying upon the iustnesse of the Warre, more then upon
the number of his Forces, resolved to try the uttermost of his witt
and cunning, without committing the matter to the hazard of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
to quench the fire that now raged with such extreeme fury.</p>

About this time also the Lord president began to giue forth spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches

a purpose to burne and spoile all the Rebels Houses and Corne, and
to take the prey of the countrie neere adioyning, through which his

to repaire and recover the credit hee had lost, by his lewd and

Lord President aymed at, before his entrance into the Field with his
Armie, was to reclaime (if possible it might be) <hi>Florence Mac Cartie</hi>
(before spoken of) from further pursuing those hatefull and ingrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
courses, which unadvisedly he had entred into. This hee desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
for divers reasons: First and especially for the service, which
he foresaw might receiue some good countenance by his subjection.
Secondly, because (if hee continued in action) of necessitie hee must
bee constrained to imploy a great part of his Forces (which hee
thought both inconvenient and dangerous to bee divided) to follow
the prosecution of him and his Complices; And lastly, a good opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
which some his honourable friends in England, and himselfe
also had conceived of him: For these causes, was the President mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
earnestly to desire, that this <hi>Florence</hi> might bee stayed from fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
persisting in those exorbitant courses, and the rather, because the
said <hi>Florence</hi> had written Letters unto him, which upon his way in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Mounster hee received, that assoone as hee should come to Corke,
hee would present himselfe personally to him, aud doe all his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours
to advance the Service. All which being made knowen
by the Lord President to the Earle of <hi>Thomond,</hi> he intreated the said
Earle, and Sir <hi>Nicholas Welsh,</hi> to joyne with <hi>Iohn fits Edmonds, Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence</hi>
his Godfather, (a man very famous in those parts, for his lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
and liberall hospitalitie in entertaining of strangers) to send a
Messenger, to signifie to <hi>Florence Mac Cartie,</hi> that they were very
desirous to conferre with him, about certaine particularities concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
his owne good. By his Letter remised in answer of this mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage,
hee appoynted both a time and place for their meeting, which
was accordingly performed. After more then two houres spent,
and many Oathes passed, as well by the Earle as Sir <hi>Nicholas Welsh,</hi>
                  <pb n="35" facs="tcp:18000:30"/>
that the President had promised his safe returne; with fearefull

hee came to Corke, and from thence to Shandon Castle, upon
the third of May, 1600,<note place="margin">3. Ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>. The submis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of Flor. Mac Carty.</note> where the Lord President remained at that
time, before whom when hee had presented himselfe, hee made
his submission upon his knees, with many protestations of the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceritie
of his Heart, and the true loyaltie, which hee alwayes bare
towards her Majestie, desiring that hee might bee received into her
Majesties favour, and hee would serue her as faithfully and unfai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedly,
as any man in Mounster. The Lord President reprooved
him very sharply, for his trayterous behaviours, laying before him
the odiousnesse and foulnesse of his faults, and the monstrous ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
towards her Majestie, from whom hee had received many
great benefits, and gracious favours: These speeches finished, the
President bade him to stand up; when as both hee, and the Earle of
<hi>Thomond,</hi> Sir <hi>Nicholas Welsh,</hi> and <hi>Iohn fits Edmund,</hi> did every of them
very feelingly preach Obedience unto him: His answer being very
generall, carried great shew of loyaltie and obedience at that time.
Vpon the next morrow hee was called before the President and
Councell, who was againe urged (by them all in generall) not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to desist from proceeding in evill, but with alacritie of minde to
doe some such service, as might merit reward; for assurance and
performance whereof, the President demaunded his eldest sonne in
pledge: for the avoydance whereof hee used many colourable rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
<hi>viz.</hi> That it would cause the Bonnoghs to forsake him, yea, and
to driue him out of his Countrey, erecting his wiues base Brother
in his place; That he had of long time tasted of miseries and wants;
That hee had lately recovered his Countrey of Desmond with great
travell and charges, and therefore like the burnt child, hee feared to
run into any such inconvenience, as might cause his friends to relapse
from him. Adding moreover, that it was needlesse in them to exact
any such thing at hishands, who was in his soule wholly addicted
&amp; devoted to her Majesties service. The weaknesse of these reasons
were both wisely discovered, and effectually answered: but all that
could bee said, was no more pleasing to him, then is delightfull mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicke
to deafe eares; which being discerned, the President betooke
himselfe to a new devise: for now hee vehemently threatned, (that
leaving for a time all other services) a sharpe prosecution of Hostili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
with fire and sword against himselfe, his tenants and followers,
should speedily overtake him, upon his returne into Desmond.
Much was hee amazed with this denunciation, and therefore hauing
made a short pawse, answered thus: Since my needlesse pledge is so
earnestly desired,<note place="margin">Flor. Mac Carties de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands.</note> I am content to leaue my
eldest sonne in Corke up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
these conditions: That her Majestie would passe unto mee the
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:18000:31"/>
Countrey of Desmond, in as large and ample manner, as before it
was conveyed unto my Father in law the Earle of <hi>Clancare.</hi> Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that shee would giue unto mee the Name and Title of <hi>Mac Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
More,</hi> or Earle of <hi>Clancare.</hi> Thirdly, that shee would giue unto
mee three hundred men in pay, for assuring my Countrey from all
that would offend it. These hyperbolicall demands, were no soo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
propounded, but absolutely rejected: Therefore he desired that
Licence might bee graunted unto him, to write to his honourable
friends in England, to worke for him the afore recited Conditions,
which without any great difficultie was permitted. Lastly, the
President questioned with him what hee intended to doe, if these
his desires were not satisfied; thereupon hee sware upon a Booke,
that hee would never beare Armes against her Majesties Forces, (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
hee were assaulted in Desmond) and that his followers should
likewise abstaine from actuall rebellion; and further, that he would
send him intelligence from time to time, of the Rebells proceedings,
and doe him the best underhand-service that possibly hee could.
Now had the President effected a great part of his desires, namely, that
by <hi>Florence</hi> his remaining in Neutralitie, his Forces might be whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
imployed against <hi>Iames fits Thomas,</hi> who being once slaine or ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished,
it would bee an easie matter to teach him to speake in a more
submissiue language, and forget to capitulate either for Lands, Title,
or Charge. <hi>Florence</hi> is now departed towards his Countrey of Des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond,
where leaving him in suspence, betwixt doubt and feare, wee
will proceed in the accidents of Corke.</p>
               <p>Now the President discerning this Warre in Mounster to be like
a Monster with many Heads, or a Servant that must obey divers
Masters, did thinke thus; that if the Heads themselues might bee set
at variance, they would proue the most fit Instruments to ruine one
another: The two chiefe Heads were the Sugan Earle (for so they
called <hi>Desmond</hi>) Commander of the Provincials, and <hi>Dermond O Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi>
Generall of the Bownoghs before mentioned. This <hi>Dermond
O Conner</hi> was a poore man in the beginning of his fortune, and not
Owner of two Plough Lands, in Connaght his natiue Countrie; his
reputation grew partly by his wife, who was daughter to the old
Earle of Desmond, and partly by his valour, being reputed one of
the most valiant Leaders, and best Commanders amongst the Irish
rebels. By meanes whereof he had now the command of foure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene
hundred men in his owne Bonaght, and besides that, might
strike a great stroke with the other, being by <hi>Tyrone</hi> at his departure
out of Mounster, ordained chiefe Commander of them all. This
man did the President make choise to deale withall, for these rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons:
First because hee knew that the said <hi>Dermond</hi> being a meere
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:18000:31"/>
Mercenary, and serving in Mounster onely for pay, might be induced
by large Summes of monie, to serue the Queene aswell as the rebels:
Secondly, hee had a very fit Instrument, whereby the more easily to
worke him to his will, namely his Wife, who being brought up
some part of her time amongst the English, had not only learned the
language, but stood reasonably well affected to the English governe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and likely it was that shee would use all her industry, to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
the service, in hope that if it succeeded well, it would proue a
good step or Ladder, to procure the liberty of her Brother <hi>Iames Fits
Gerald,</hi> Sonne and Heire to <hi>Gerald</hi> Earle of Desmond slaine (now
Prisoner in the Tower) and to raise his fortunes. Lastly it was pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely
knowen that the Sugan Earle, would never doe service upon
the Bownoghs, except he might haue both the title and possessions of
the Earle of Desmond confirmed unto him, which her Maiestie
would never condiscend unto. Vpon these grounds in very secret
manner, hee provided and sent a fit agent, to sound the inclination of
the Lady <hi>Margaret,</hi> for so was <hi>Dermonds</hi> Wife named; and finding
her fit to bee wrought upon, the Conditions should be propounded,
<hi>viz.</hi> That if her husband would take <hi>Desmond</hi> Prisoner, and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
him into the hands of the President, he should incontinently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
one thousand pound sterling; and that he should haue a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
of men in pay from the Queene, and other conditions of satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction,
to her selfe and her Brother: The Messenger was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o sooner
sent about these important affaires, but that another occasion offered
it selfe unto the President, of no lesse moment then the former, to
aduance the service: for immediately hereupon, one <hi>Iohn Nugent</hi>
sometimes servant to <hi>Sir Thomas Norris,</hi> late President of Mounster,
pretending some wrongs and iniuries to be offered unto him by the
State, ioyned with the Rebels, and became (to his power) the most
malitious and bloody Traitor in all these parts. At last having as it
should seeme spit his poyson, and spent his Venome, sought to Sir
<hi>Warham Saint Leger,</hi> and Sir <hi>Henry Power,</hi> the Commissioners, to
be received into protection; who more for feare of the hurt that hee
might doe, then hope of the good that hee would doe, granted the
same, untill the Lord Presidents pleasure (who was now ready to
depart from Dublin towards Mounster) were further knowen. At
this time therefore <hi>Nugent</hi> came to make his submission to the Presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,<note place="margin">The submis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent.</note>
and to desire pardon for his faults committed: Answer was
made, that for so much as his crimes and offences had beene extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary,
hee could not hope to bee reconciled unto the State, except
hee would deserue it by extraordinary service, which saith the Presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
if you shall performe, you may deserue not onely Pardon for
your faults committed heretofore, but also some store of Crownes
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:18000:32"/>
to releeue your wants hereafter; Hee presently promised, not to bee
wanting in any thing that lay in the power of one man to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plish,
and in private made offer to the President, that if he might bee
well recompenced, hee would ruine within a short space, either the
Sugan Earle, or <hi>Iohn Fits Thomas</hi> his Brother. And indeed very likely
hee was both to attempt and performe as much as he spake. To at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
because hee was so valiant and daring, as that he did not feare
any thing; and to execute, because by reason of his many outrages be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
committed, the chiefe Rebels did repose great confidence in him.
The President having contrived a plot for <hi>Iames Fits Thomas</hi> (as is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
shewed) gaue him in charge to undertake <hi>Iohn</hi> his Brother: But
because the matter might be caried without any suspition, upon the
next morrow, the Councell being set, and a great concourse of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
assembled, <hi>Nugent</hi> renueth his suite for the continuance of his
protection. But the President rehearsing in publike audience, a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talogue
of his mischievous outrages lately committed, told the
Councell, that having farther enquired, and better considered of
Man and Matter, for his part hee thought it an action of very ill ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
to receiue unto mercy such a notorious Malefactor: the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell
were all of the same opinion, who reviling him with many bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
and bitter speeches, and assuring him, that if it were not for a
religious regard, that was holden of the Queenes word, hee should
pay a deare price for his former misdemeanor, and so with publike
disgrace, was he dismissed their presence. The promised submission
of the white Knight, the jealousie which the rebels conceived of
<hi>Florence Mac Carty</hi> by his comming to the President, and the Presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents
Iourney being now blazed through the Province, it caused
<hi>Pierce La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Brough burnt by Pierce Lacy.</note> who all the time of the Warres (untill now) had kept a

to hold the same against her Majesties Forces; And know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it was a convenient place for a Garrison, pluckt downe some
part of the Castle, burnt the rest, and by the light thereof, ran into the
Woods: <hi>Redmond Burke</hi>

and kept himselfe for a little time about the borders of Own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hy,
where being pressed with want of Victuals, he intended to leaue
the Province. The Sugan Earle, <hi>Pierce Lacy</hi> and some other hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
of this sudden departure, dispatched Messengers unto him, with
earnest entreaties, and large promises, for increasing his Bonnoght,
if hee would returne, but to no purpose. The cause of this his unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
departure was a trafficke betweene him and the President,
who did uphold him in certaine faint hopes, about the obtaining of
the Barronie of Lettrim, which he claimed as his inheritance: For
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:18000:32"/>
this is most true, that not long before this time, one <hi>Richard
Burke</hi>
Vncle to the said <hi>Redmond,</hi> wrote unto the President, that his Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew
would be very glad of his Lordships favour, &amp; that he would
withdraw both himselfe and his Bownoghs out of Mounster, so
that hee would not send any Forces to molest him in Connaght.
Whereunto was answered, that it became nor a Governour, no not a
private Subject to make any such agreement with a man in his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition:
And farther that hee might assure himselfe, that by strong
hand he could never invest himselfe in the Barrony of Lettrim, nor be
in secure possession of his Fathers Lands: But if he would reclaime
himselfe and doe service to her Majestie, the President would use the
best friends that hee had, either in England or Ireland, that his cause
might bee respected with all favour according to the equity thereof.</p>
               <p>Not long after the receit of this Letter, hee left the Countie of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mericke,
severed himselfe from the Mounster Rebells, and setled in
Ormond, and <hi>Tirrell</hi> stayed not long behinde, inwardly doubting
some practise upon himselfe, but publikely pretending the cause of
his departure, for a mislike betweene him and <hi>Dermond O Conner.</hi>
The President had given foorth, ever since his first comming to
Corke, that his Armie should bee on foot in the way to Limerick,
by the sixth of May; his intention not being to rise untill the twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth:
the bruit thereof caused the Rebells greatest strength to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble
together, who by the day assigned, had united their Forces
in the great Wood called Kilmore, betweene Moyallo, and Kilmal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock,
neere the place of Ballihawre, through the which the Armie
was to march. There they continued the space of tenne dayes, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
continually, and hearkening daily for the Presidents com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming:
but finding that hee stirred not in all this time, (imagining
that he durst not take the field at all) they dispersed their Companies,
and departed every one into his owne Countrey. Heereupon some
thought, that the President had altered his determination for going
to Limerick, and intended to begin the prosecution in some other
place: others supposed, that hee would not venture out of Corke,
untill hee had received new Supplies, which were daily expected
out of England: But both the one and other were besides the
marke; for by this stay, (which from the beginning he determined)
hee saw divers commodious opportunities might accrue unto him,
as that heereby hee should receiue certaine advertisement of the
strength of the enemy that was to confront him, and also that it was
impossible for them (any long time) to hold together, for divers
wants which of necessitie must accompany such an undisciplined
and disordered multitude, by meanes whereof they would bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained
to breake with their owne weight; wherein he nothing fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:18000:33"/>
of his expectation; for within a few dayes following, they were
all divided into so many places, and those so farre distant, that they
could not speedily be reassembled.</p>

Force &amp; Provision of victuals to prosecute him freshly in the Reare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
as you respect me, the exaltation of the Catholike faith, and
the ease of our countrey: I looke no excuse at your hands, which I
pray to lay apart, wherein you shall further the service, and bind me
with all my Forces to second you at your need. I haue retained <hi>Der<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond

the Clanshihies and other Bonoghs with the rising out of my coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,

Galdie</hi> alias <hi>Butler,</hi> brother to the Lord of Cahir, and as it was sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
by many pregnant presumptions, not without the consent
and working of the Lord himselfe, which in after times proved to
be true. The carelesse securitie of the Warders, together with the
treachery of an Irish-man, who was placed sentinell upon the top of
the Castle, were the causes of this Surprize.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Iames Galdie</hi> had no more in his Companie then sixty men, and
comming to the Wall of the Bawne of the Castle undiscovered by
the helpe of Ladders, and some Masons that brake holes in some
part of the Wall where it was weake, got in and entered the Hall,
before they were perceived, the Sergeant named <hi>Thomas Quayle,</hi>
which had the charge of the Castle, made some little resistance, and
was wounded: Three of the Warde were slaine, the rest upon pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
of their liues rendered their Armes, and were sent to Clonmell.
Of this Surprize the Lord President had notice when he was at Kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mallocke,
whereupon hee sent direction for their imprisonment in
Clonmell, untill hee might haue leasure to try the delinquents by a
Marshals Court. Vpon the fourth day following <hi>Iames Butler</hi> who
tooke the Castle wrote a large Letter to the President, to excuse him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe

                     <p>RIght Honourable, hither came unto me yesterday my Lord my

be the causes why I should attempt the surprising of the castle of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hir,
being kept as a garrison for her Majestie. And albeit my good Lo:
I may not, nor will not justifie what hath been done therein; yet
will I signifie the truth, (the which graciously being <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">

where heretofore by youthfull instigation, and as I must <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">

                        </gap>
together without the privitie of my Lord my Brother aforesaid, I
kept the said Castle, untill the same was besieged by her Majesties
Forces, and battery layd thereunto; the which I made choise rather
to forsake, then stand to the defence thereof; which action my good
Lord, was so much raised to my contempt, with the mouthes of her

                        <pb facs="tcp:18000:35"/>

Highnesse enemies, (whom I then of force obeyed) as they imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
nothing else would raise credit, but the gaining thereof againe.
The next that mooved mee to enterprise the same, was, that publike
report was made in the name of the Archbishop of Cassell, (who is
well knowen to bee a professed enemy of my House) to haue the
keeping of the said Castle. Thirdly, that it was also reported, that
the Souldiers of late left in garrison therein, purposed for want to
sell the same for a piece of money, unto <hi>Iohn</hi> of <hi>Desmond,</hi> whom the
Countrey knoweth not to bee my friend, for the late killing of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of his men, for which service, my Lord of <hi>Dunboyne</hi> had only the
thankes, being no more assistant thereunto then your Lordship: and
last my good Lord, when I considered the apparant wrongs (as I
thought) proffered unto both my Brethren, that your Honour and
the State would countenance their knowen and vowed Enemies
against them, and to make their griefes the more corrosiue to bestow
upon them, the chiefe and dwelling Castle, of the one of them being
Cnocknamma to my Lo: of Dunboyne, which makes my poore bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to goe in a manner a begging, and my Eldest Brothers Castle of
Dorenlare upon <hi>Richard Power.</hi> These being the principall causes
that moveth this my desperate attempt, I pray may be construed, as if
your Lordship or any other Gentleman were in my case, and doe also
request, that your Honour, and all others, doe suspend to condemne
me, of my Disloyaltie in mind, howsoever my youthfull actions doe
deserue; And that by example the same may the better appeare, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
that having wonne the Castle aforesaid, that unlesse it be such as
by mischance were slaine, I suffered not the blood of any other, nor
any part of their apparell to bee spilt, or taken, but send them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted
to the next incorporate Towne; And for her Majesties Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance,
that here hath beene left, I could wish your Lordship had
them, only that I know, they must be removed by the force of many
men, the which I dare not adventure to trust (as now I stand<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) But
let your Honor be well assured, they shall be as safely kept as former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
they were, for her Majestie; Vnlesse your Honour or the State doe
driue me to doe that I shall be unwilling. Forasmuch therefore my
good Lord, as not only these, but many else the causes of the rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of this Province, haue hitherto and are well knowen, to bee for
want of considerate Iustice, and clemencie of your Predecessors, Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors,
sheweth liberally the benefit of her Majesties Proclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and gratious authoritie given you; And let the first example
thereof be, to withdraw the Castles of Darenlare and Cnocknamma
aforesaid, from the possession of such, as the world doe know, of
pretended malice, to haue sought them, and to be bestowed, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
your Lordship doe thinke fit in Iustice they shall bee given:
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:18000:37"/>
And this much my very good Lord in excuse, and as the simple truth
of the Premises, I am bold to signifie; and now it resteth, I must
complaine against my Lord and Brother, who as I suppose ought to
maintaine both me and the rest, whose wrongs hitherto proffered, I
will not forgiue, nor forget, having so sufficient a distresse as now I
haue in possession, the which I purpose to keepe, untill our contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie
be decided by friends, or your Lordship, or the State doe deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
betweene us; Holding the same with most assured safetie to
her Majesties use, and no hurt unto my countrey, and to your Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours
good liking, and not otherwise: all the premises concluded and
considered, it resteth now onely how I shall be maintained, which
my good Lord is to be supplied, by that gratious entertainement, that
her Majestie hath, and doeth bestovv, upon lesse faithfull, more
unable to doe her service, and not so vvilling as my selfe; The vvhich
in company vvith the rest, I leaue to your favourable consideration:
Yet all these shall not satisfie me, but that it may please your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
to forgiue and forget, if in ignorance I haue either spoken or

               <p>The foure and twentieth,<note place="margin">24. Maij.</note> the Armie encamped at the Brough,
where the President left a Ward, partly to offend the Rebels of Logh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guire,
three miles distant from thence; and partly to open the way
betwixt Kilmallocke and Limerick, which for two yeares space had
been impassible for any subject.</p>
               <p>The fiue and twentieth,<note place="margin">25 Maij.</note> the army passing neere Loghguire, which
was as yet held by the Rebels, the President attended with a Troope
of Horse, rode to take a particular view of the strength and scitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
thereof, as also by what way hee might most conveniently
bring the Cannon to annoy the same. Hee found it to bee a place
of exceeding strength, by reason that it was an Iland, encompassed
with a deepe Lough, the breadth thereof being in the narrowest
place, a Calievers shot over, upon one side thereof standeth a verie
strong Castle, which at this time was manned with a good Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
for there was within the Iland <hi>Iohn fits Thomas,</hi> with two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
men at the least, which shewed themselues prepared to defend
the place. The President being approached within shot, to discover
the ground, they discharged some twentie Muskets at him and his
company, but without any hurt done: and having effected as much
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:18000:37"/>
as hee intended at that time, they casting foorth some reviling spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
he left the place. That night the President came to Limerick,
the Armie incamped within little more then a mile thereof. The
three dayes next following, wee bestowed in providing things ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
for the mounting and drawing of the Cannon, the Citie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
altogether destitute of necessaries thereunto, which at last with
many difficulties was effected: Wherein the President shewed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
to bee a Master in that facultie; for Canonier or other Artificer
(skilfull in the mountures of Ordnance) he had none, the Smiths and
Carpenters were onely directed by him, according to the proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
hee gaue, they wrought, and in the end a demie-Cannon vvas
mounted, and drawen towards the gate of the Cittie, that leadeth to
the Iland of Loghguire before named. The Rebels within the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
receiving intelligence thereof, one <hi>Owen Grome,</hi> a stranger of the
North, (to whose charge <hi>Iohn fits Thomas</hi> had committed the custo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
of the Castle) sent vvord, That for his pardon, and a competent
summe of money, hee vvould deliver it up unto her Majesties use.
The President considering, that many impediments would arise, if
hee should attempt the taking of it by force, and that it must needs
bee chargeable to the Queene, cost the liues of many his men, and a
great delay for the prosecution of other services, which he intended,
accorded to his demaunds,<note place="margin">Therendring of the Castle of Loghguire</note> and received the Castle, the monie (which
was threescore pounds) being paied by the Presidents order, by one
<hi>Rowlye,</hi> who lost the fame to the Rebels: Whilest these things were
in handling, <hi>Nugent</hi> (whose Promises to the President before we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited)
intending no longer to deferre the Enterprize, attempted the
execution in this sort. The President being past Loghguire, <hi>Iohn
Fits Thomas</hi> riding forth of the Iland towards the fastnes of Arloghe,
where most of his men remained, with one other called <hi>Iohn Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinger,</hi>
whom hee had acquainted with the Enterprize,<note place="margin">Nugents at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt upon Iohn fits Thomas.</note> and as hee
thought made sure unto him, attended this great Captaine, and being
now passed a certaine distance from all Companie, permitted <hi>Iohn
Fits Thomas</hi> to ride a little before him, minding (his backe being tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned)
to shoote him through with his Pistoll; Which for the purpose
was well charged with two bullets; the opportunitie offered, the
Pistoll bent, both heart and hand, ready to doe the deed, when <hi>Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinger</hi>
at the instant snatched the Pistoll from him, crying, Treason:
wherewith <hi>Iohn fits Thomas</hi> turning himselfe about, perceived his
intent. <hi>Nugent</hi> thinking to escape by the goodnesse of his Horse,
spurred hard; the horse stumbled, and hee taken, and the next day
after examination, and confession of his intent, hanged. This plot,
a though it attained not fully the desired successe, yet it prooved to
bee of great consequence: For now was <hi>Iohn fits Thomas</hi> possessed
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:18000:38"/>
with such a jealous suspition of every one, that he durst not remaine
long at Loghguire, for feare of some other like attempt that might
be wrought against him; and therefore leaving the Castle in the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stodie
of the said <hi>Owen Grome,</hi> (who as before, kept it a very short
time after) departed suddenly unto his Brothers Campe. <hi>Nugent</hi> in
his Examination freely confessed his whole intent, which was (as
hee then said) to haue dispatched <hi>Iohn fits Thomas,</hi> and immediately
to haue poasted unto the Sugan Earle, to carry the first newes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
intending to call him aside, in secret manner to relate the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
of his Brothers murther, and then to execute as much upon him
also; Adding moreover, that although they take away his life,
(which he would not intreat them to spare) yet was their owne safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
never the more assured: for there were many others, which him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
perfectly knew, to haue sollemnly sworne unto the President
to effect as much as hee intended. This confession being sealed with
his death, did strike such a fearefull terrour into the two Brethren,
that <hi>Iames Fits Thomas</hi> himselfe afterwards, unto the President ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged,
they never durst lodge together in one place, or ever
serue in the Heads of their Troopes, for feare to be shot by some of
their owne men.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Loghguire</hi> being now possessed for the Queene,<note place="margin">Clanwilliam spoiled and burnt by the Armie.</note> and the Armie
well refreshed, the President marched into Clan-William a countrie
of the Burks; Whereupon one of the principall Freeholders then in
rebellion called <hi>Iohn Burke,</hi> halfe Brother to <hi>Pierce Lacy,</hi> desired to
come unto the President, but no eare would be given to his request,
untill he had first testified his humble submission, whereof hee made
scruple, alleaging that his conscience would not suffer him so to doe,
having before beene taught by his Instructers that it was sinfull and
damnable, personally to submit himselfe unto her Majestie; His an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
was much disdained, and he plainely told, that he should never
hope to be accepted for a Subject, and receiue the benefit thereof, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
hee would absolutely disclaime that rebellious opinion; which
hee absolutely refusing, was sent away with this Proviso: That al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
himselfe did fly into the Woods; yet his Castles, Townes,
and Corne, which hee could not carry with him, should be the next
morrow destroyed, which was not vainely meant, but truely perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
for by the Noone of the next day, being the twentie nineth of
<hi>May,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">29. Maij.</note> the Armie came upon his Lands, many of his Houses, some of
his Corne, and one of his Castles fired. When a second Messenger,
came to intreate that he might bee admitted to make his submission,
whether it were that some Popish Priest, had granted him a Dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation,
or that he would undertake himselfe to dispence with his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
rather then see himselfe ruin'd, is to me uncertaine; But sure I
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:18000:38"/>
am, that this alteration was now wrought in him. Very unwilling
was the President to accept him to mercy, which the day before hee
so unadvisedly refused; Yet being much importuned by his Mother
and others, who with weeping eyes intreated for him, and the rather
that he had maried one of Sir <hi>George Thorntons</hi> Daughters, was incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to admit him to his presence.</p>

upon their knees by the Horse side) it was told unto him that two of
the <hi>Burks</hi> were there; he staying his Horse, spent some time in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving
them for their rebellious obstinacie, and then (upon foure
sufficient Sureties for their future Loyaltie) granted them protection.
The next day the Armie marched to a Castle called Ballitrarsny,<note place="margin">The castle of Ballitrarsnie taken.</note> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
to <hi>Mouroughe Kewghe</hi> one of the Brians, which stood neere
a great Fastnesse, being very commodious, both to open the passage
from Limerick, to Gashell, and to hinder the Rebels for comming
out of Kilquige into Conniloghe: The Rebels of the Ward, assoone
as they saw the Armie draw towards them, quitted the castle; which
was not to bee wonne but by the Cannon; and therein was found
great plenty of Graine; whereof some was largely bestowed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst

                     <p>COusen, your Letters of the fifth of this present, I received the
eighth of the same, wherein you write of your sicknesse, and
the impediments that caused your Souldiers to bee slow in prosecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
our generall Action. In your former Letters you write and
vow, that there hath been neither peace, truce, nor cessation confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
betweene you and the President. I am informed by my parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
friends, and also by a Letter (intercepted) from the President
to you, that some mittigation of time is limitted betwixt you and
them, whereupon they depend, your assistance to be restrained from
us. If this be thus, it is farre contrary to that I hoped, and much be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
the confidence reposed by <hi>Oneale</hi> and my selfe in your vowed
fidelitie and service to God and our Action. I perceiue <hi>Donell Mac
Cartie</hi> is raising head in disquieting your Countrey, the redresse
whereof consisted in your constant assistance to bee bestowed; the
President being not able to performe any service by Land, hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynted
to come by Sea to Askeiton, and some force out of Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond
towards the Glinne; all which by the divine providence of
God shall be prevented. The causes of urgent affaires are very ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
which required your presence and helping assistance, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
your sound advice, can hardly bee accomplished. And therefore
in regard of your fidelitie, let mee intreat you, (if your sicknesse bee
not apparantly knowen to bee so extreame) to lay all excuses apart,
and to draw towards this Countrey, with so few or so many as you
may possibly afford; else you giue us cause to thinke of some inward
meaning in you, contrary to our generall action. At your entreatie,
and Letters, I haue discharged <hi>Dermond Mac Tirlogh,</hi> his Sonne I will
keepe till that you and I doe conferre further of that cause. For <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus

I understand you haue apprehended <hi>Owen Mac Shihy,</hi> I desire you to
see him released, and restitution made of what hee had taken from
him; and if you can charge him for any offence to you, I will upon
these my Letters see him to bee forth comming, to answer his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt,
I pray you delay not his release, for I haue present occasion to

               <p>Whilest the President was at Limerick,<note place="margin">O Sulevan More detai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned prisoner by the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise of Flor: Mac Cartie.</note> hee had certaine notice
brought him, that <hi>Florence Mac Cartie</hi> had a meeting in Connilogh,
with <hi>Iames fits Thomas,</hi> and <hi>Dermond O Conner,</hi> and there in a parlie,
because <hi>Osulevan More</hi> did refuse to contribute towards the bearing
of his Bownoghs in Desmond, hee contrived with <hi>Dermond O Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,</hi>
that hee should lay hands upon him, but it must bee done as it
were by force, that it might appeare to the world, that it was against
his will: for <hi>O Sulevan</hi> was his Brother in law, having married his
Sister. Thus was <hi>O Sulevan</hi> betrayed by his deare Brother, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
prisoner by <hi>Dermond:</hi> And also there was at that time, by
<hi>Florence</hi> his directions, the two Brothers of <hi>O Sulevan More,</hi> the two
<hi>Odonoghs, Mac Finires</hi> sonne, and others to the number of eighteene,
delivered as pledges into the hands of <hi>Dermond,</hi> for <hi>Bonnoght</hi> due
unto him, which <hi>Florence</hi> should haue payed; all which prisoners
were sent by him unto Castlelishin.</p>
               <p>Before the President departed from Limerick, the Earle of Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond,
invited him to his Castle of Bonrattie; the same night that
hee was there, in the Evening, Captaine <hi>Gawen Harvie,</hi> (who from
Corke was embarqued the very day that the President marched
from thence with his Armie as aforesayd) came into the River of
Shenan, to an anchor, at the mouth of the Creeke, where the Castle
is seated: Hee brought with him, to the comfort of the whole Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie,
Money, Munition, Victuall, and Apparell for the Souldiers,
which if it had not come in due time, it might haue prooved a ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard
for the overthrow of that Summer Service. The next morning
Captaine <hi>Harvie</hi> was directed to goe to the Key at Limricke, where
after his charge was landed, the President willed him to fall downe
with his Ship, and to ride before the Castle of the Glinne, there to
remaine at an anchor, untill bee with the Armie should present him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
before it, and sent with him a Demie Cannon, for the guard
whereof, certaine Souldiers were appointed under his charge.</p>
               <p>Much did it amuse the minds both of the Councell of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince,<note place="margin">The plot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived by the Lo. President for the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension of Ia. fits Thomas.</note>
and of all the Commanders in the Armie, to see the Forces
suddenly dispersed, at such a time, as for divers reasons they thought
very unseasonable: The Armie for the numbers was strong, having
received no disaster since their comming into the field, the time of
the yeare, (being now about the beginning of Iune)<note place="margin">Iune.</note> was most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:18000:40"/>
to lie in Campe; whereas if the Service should bee deferred
untill Winter, the Companies would bee weakened both by death
and sicknesse, and more difficulties should they find in the fowlnesse
of the weather, and deepnesse of the way, then in the sword of the
Enemy, whom now they did ardently desire to encounter with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all:
yea, many there were, that ceased not confidently to utter,
that they did now plainely perceiue, that though her Majesties
charges was greatly inhaunsed by increasing the List in Mounster,
yet her Service was likely to be no better followed then in the yeare
last past.</p>
               <p>But that the true ground of this action may bee discovered, wee
must haue recourse to the prosecution of the stratagem, that all this
while had beene in working with <hi>Dermond O Conner;</hi> for after his
Wife the Lady <hi>Margaret</hi> had acquainted him, both with the Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize
and Conditions (which was not untill the Armie was at Kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mallock
aforesaid) hee shewed a good inclination to effect it, were it
not for three difficulties that seemed to interpose themselues: First, the
President being altogether unknowen to him, he demanded sufficient
Pledges to be put into his hands, there to remaine untill the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
promised should be performed. Secondly, he wanted some shew
of reason or colourable cause, to satisfie his Copartners in excuse of
his action: And lastly he alleaged that no opportunitie could bee
found for the execution of the Designe, so long as <hi>Iames Fits Thomas</hi>
remained with all the force hee could possible make sixe miles from
the Campe, to confront the Presidents Armie in his passage to Askei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton:
For assurance of the conditions, the President was content to
deliver into his hands foure Pledges, which yet notwithstanding
must bee in such sort delivered by the one, and received by the other,
as no suspition might arise: The Hostages agreed upon, were <hi>Red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi>
and <hi>Brian,</hi> Sonnes of <hi>Milerius Mac Craghe</hi> Archbishop of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shell;
who himselfe had before beene a Principall Actor in the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sines,
and Captaine <hi>William Power,</hi> and <hi>Iohn Power</hi> his elder Brother,
who likewise had been imployed in the Action. These were made
choice of; because they might be free from the violence of <hi>Dermond
O Conners</hi> men; The <hi>Powers</hi> being foster brethren to the Lady <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garet<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi>
and the Archbishop himselfe borne in Vlster, a naturall Follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
unto the Arch-Traitor <hi>Tyrone.</hi> Therefore that these fower should
make a Iournie from Kilmallocke towards Kinsale, where Captaine
<hi>Poore</hi> his Companie were then in Garrison; and the time of their
going being made knowen to <hi>Dermond O Conner,</hi> he should lye with
some of his Forces, in the pace of Ballihowre to intercept Passen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
where these foure should (as it were) by chance fall into his
Ambush, and so they did, where <hi>Dermond O Conner,</hi> although for the
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:18000:40"/>
reasons before mentioned, saved their liues, yet he could not restraine
the furie of his men, that knew nothing of his purpose, but that they
were stripped of their clothes, and left almost naked.</p>
               <p>These being in this manner taken the eleaventh day of <hi>Iune,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">11. Iunij.</note> they
were presently caried to Castle Lyshin, seated in the great Wood cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
Kilmore, seven miles from Kilmallock (where the Lady <hi>Marga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret</hi>
his Wife then remained;) and there straightly kept in Irons, untill
the Ransome were discharged, which was given forth to be no lesse
then two thousand pound sterling.</p>
               <p>Assoone as they were taken, <hi>Iames Fits Thomas</hi> repaired to Castle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishin,
and instantly requested <hi>Dermond,</hi> that he might haue the two
<hi>Powers</hi> executed; for unto them hee was an ancient Enemy, which
<hi>Dermond</hi> would not assent unto, as well in respect of the great ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soms,
which hee pretended to expect from them, as for giving of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
unto his Wife, unto whose Brother (then in the Tower of
London) they were foster Brothers; then the which in Ireland, there
is no greater Obligations of loue.</p>
               <p>The first Impediment being thus removed, care was taken to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vise
some shew of reason to excuse this action to the Bonoghs (if
they should be discontented) after the execution thereof; which was
disguised by a Letter as written by the Sugan Earle from the Presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent;
which forasmuch as the Contents thereof doe manifest the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention:
I haue thought not unfit to bee inserted in this present

                     <head>The Lord Presidents Letter to Iames
Fits Thomas.</head>
                     <p>SIr, your last Letters I haue received, and am exceeding glad to see
your constant resolution of returne to subjection, and to leaue
the rebellious courses wherein you haue long persevered; You may
rest assured that promises shall bee kept; and you shall no sooner
bring <hi>Dermond O Conner</hi> to me, aliue or dead, and banish his Bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noghs
out of the Countrie, but that you shall haue your demand sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied,
which I thanke God, I am both able and willing to performe:
Beleeue me, you haue no better way to recover your desperate estate,
then by this good service, which you haue proffred; and therefore
I cannot but commend your Iudgement, in choosing the same to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeme
your former faults: And I doe the rather beleeue the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance
of it, by your late action touching <hi>Loghguire,</hi> wherein your
Brother and your selfe haue well merited; and as I promised, you
shall finde mee so just, as no Creature living shall ever know, that
either of you did assent to the surrender of it; all your Letters I haue
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:18000:41"/>
received, as also the joynt Letter, from your Brother and your selfe; I
pray loose no time; for delayes in great Actions are subject to many
dangers. Now that the Queenes Armie is in the field, you may
worke your determination with most securitie, being ready to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue
you upon a dayes warning: So praying God to assist you in
this meritorious Enterprize, I doe leaue you to his protection this
twentie nineth of <hi>May</hi> 1600.</p>
                     <p>This Letter was sent to <hi>Dermond O Conner,</hi> which when time
should serue, hee might shew as intercepted by him; and therefore
what he did, was imposed upon him by necessitie, except hee would
suffer himselfe, wittingly and willingly to be betraied.</p>
                     <p>These things thus contrived, there remained nothing but to sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
the reputed Earle from his strength, that no resistance might be
made by the Provincialls, when hee should bee apprehended. This
was not likely to bee effected, unlesse the President would divide
his Forces, and bestow them in severall Garrisons, as though they
should leaue the field for that Summer, whereupon was judged
that the Rebels would likewise disperse themselues; and even so it
came to passe: for they understanding that the English Armie was
now garrison'd,<note place="margin">500 men sent to lye in gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison at As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keiton.</note> (nothing suspecting that he would adventure to send
a Garrison to Askeiton, without the countenance of an Armie) sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
themselues into divers Companies. The President had no soo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
advertisement hereof, but hee sent foorthwith under the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
of Sir <hi>Francis Barkley,</hi> fiue hundred Foot from Limricke by
water, to goe to Askeiton, which they might easily effect in a fewe
howers, too short a time for them to assemble their Forces to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peach
their landing: By these meanes were they setled in Garrison,
without any other difficultie then a light Skirmish, the number of
the Rebells to giue them resistance, not exceeding two or three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
at the most, which otherwise could not haue beene effected
without much blood.</p>
                     <p>The seventh of this moneth of Iune, the President received Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence
from <hi>Iohn Butler,</hi> a Gentleman of the Countie of Tipper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary,
that the Earle of <hi>Ormond,</hi> for the ransome of three thousand
poud sterling, to be paied upon certaine daies agreed upon, was to be
enlarged, and set at libertie by <hi>Ownhie Mac Rory Omore,</hi> with whom
hee had been prisoner ever since the tenth day of Aprill: for the true
payment of the same, twelue Hostages, who were the eldest sonnes
of the principall Gentlemen in the Countrey, were delivered into

ensuing, at which time the Earle himselfe by his Letters advertised
him thereof.</p>
                     <p>I must here craue a little leaue to looke backe to time past, as well
to relate by what meanes the Armie in Mounster was from time to
time enabled to subsist in this prosecution, as to shew the actes and
the progresse in the same. No man is ignorant, that Armies of mens
bodies cannot subsist, unlesse they bee continually supplyed with
Money, Munition, and Victualls, and especially in such a Kingdome
as Ireland is, which was exhausted of all meanes of those natures,
by the continuance of the Rebellion, and particularly in Mounster,
before the President came thither: so as unlesse hee had beene care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
supplyed of them out of England, no service could haue beene
performed, and heerein I cannot but commend his care in demaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
as the Lords of the Councells readinesse to effect the same.
At his departure from the Court of England, hee humbly prayed,
that against his comming into the Province, (for as you haue heard
hee went by the way of Dublin) some proportions of Money, Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition,
and Victualls might bee sent thither, whereof their Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships
were not unmindfull, as by their Letters dated the eight and
twentieth of March last past may appeare, wherein they certified
the President,<note place="margin">Supplies of money, muni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als, &amp;c.</note> that they had sent for the Province of Mounster, nine
thousand pound in money, three moneths victualls for three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
Foot, and two hundred and fiftie Horse (which was the List
of his Armie) and as hee desired, the one halfe of it was sent to
Corke, and the other moitie to Limricke: Also fiue Lasts of Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
with Lead, and Match proportionably, with two hundred six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
nine Quarters of Oates; All which arrived in May following,
the Oates excepted, which came to Corke in Aprill: Moreover, in
the same moneth the Souldiers Summer Suites arrived at Corke:
Further, as by their Lordshipps Letters to the President, dated the
seventeenth of Iune, they had sent for the supply of the Province, fiue
Lasts more of Powder, with Match and Lead; And that shortly
afterward, there should bee sent unto him tenne thousand pound in
Money, and two moneths victualls for the Armie, the one moitie to
land at Corke, the other at Limricke, as hee had demaunded; And
for that they had heere certified, that the Souldiers, (having had by
her Majesties favour their Powder given unto them without any
defalkation upon their entertainments) made unnecessary use of the
same, and sometimes sold it to the Irish Merchants, and others, they
required the President to let them know, and to take order accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly,
that they should not be allowed any expence of Powder, but
in dayes of trayning or service onely.</p>
                     <p>But to returne to <hi>Dermond O Conner,</hi> who now perceiving that it
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:18000:43"/>
was a fit time for his Designe, sent a Messenger to the Earle of Des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond,<note place="margin">The appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension of Iames Fits Thomas by Dermond O Conner.</note>
for so he called <hi>Iames Fits Thomas,</hi> desiring him to meete him
at a place of parlie upon the eighteenth of <hi>Iune,</hi> to conferre about
certaine matters concerning the Warres. <hi>Iames Fits Thomas</hi> (as hee
since confessed to the President) had received some secret intelligence
of <hi>Dermond</hi> his intent; which although he did not absolutely credit,
yet did it worke some jealousie in him; and therefore brought with
him to the Parlie some two hundred of his Foote: <hi>Dermond O Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi>
brought one hundred and fiftie Bownoghs: After some speech
passed, among the chiefe, at last, a Controversie did arise betweene
<hi>Moroghe Mac Shihy,</hi> Marshall to <hi>Iames Fits Thomas,</hi> and the Marshall
of Dermond, about such Hides, as were or should bee killed in the
Armie; the one deriving his authoritie from <hi>Tyrone,</hi> the other from
the Earle of Desmond; in contention they grew warme, and <hi>Der<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi>
so blew the Coale, that the kerne of the one, and the Bonoghs
of the other, were ready to passe from words to blowes; much did
the Sugan Earle labour to quiet this Mutiny, which could not bee
throughly appeased, untill the Companies on either part were seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
and dispersed: <hi>Iames Fits Thomas</hi> willing to giue all satisfaction
to <hi>Dermond</hi> and the Bownoghs, made offer to dismisse his owne
men, which was willingly accepted of the other, and so sent them
into the Countrie neere adjoyning: They being departed, and the
Principals setled againe to parlie, about the deciding of this contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie;
the Bownoghs by <hi>Dermonds</hi> appointment drew neere unto
them: Then <hi>Dermond O Conner</hi> layed hold upon <hi>Iames Fits Thomas,</hi>
and said, <hi>My Lord you are in hand;</hi> in hand (<hi>answered he</hi>) for whom, or
for what cause? I haue taken you for <hi>Oneale,</hi> saith he, and I purpose to
detaine you, untill I bee certified of his pleasure, for your selfe haue
combined with the English, and promised to the President to deliver
me, either aliue or dead into his hands; and for Proofe thereof, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
(saith he) Letters which were intercepted, and brought to mee
(under the Presidents hand) to confirme the same, and therewithall
produced them.</p>
                     <p>This colourable Pretence, gaue a good satisfaction to the Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
for the present; and yet for the better content, hee gaue <hi>Thomas
Oge</hi> of Kerry, and two of the <hi>Clanshyhies</hi> Brethren, whom he tooke
also at the same time, unto the chiefest of his Captaines, to be reserved
for their Ransomes.</p>
                     <p>Now <hi>Iames Fits Thomas,</hi> and the other Prisoners being mounted

<hi>Dermond O Conner</hi> went presently to another Castle called Ballialli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nan,
belonging to <hi>Rory Mac Shihy,</hi> Father to the two brethren of the
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:18000:43"/>
                        <hi>Mac Shihies</hi> before mentioned, which he also tooke, and therein set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
himselfe, and sent with all speed to Castle Lishin for his Wife and
the English Pledges, which were there in Handlocks; Leaving some
sixteene Warders to guard the Prisoners; these hee removed from
thence, either because they might more conveniently, send some one
of them, with the relation of his doings to the Lord President, or
for feare lest the Friends and Followers of the Arch-Traitor, <hi>Des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond,</hi>
reuniting themselues, and his owne Bonoghs, of whom hee
was very uncertaine, taking part with them, they might joyne their
Forces, and at one push, both rescue the Prisoners that he had taken,
and also take himselfe Prisoner, and the fower English Pledges: To
the intent therefore, that he might not adventure all his substance in
one Shippe, he divided them as before you haue heard.</p>
                     <p>These businesses thus contrived,<note place="margin">19. Iunij.</note> 
                        <hi>Dermond O Conner,</hi> upon the
nineteenth of <hi>Iune,</hi> sent <hi>Iohn Power</hi> (one of the Pledges before spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
of) in all hast to the President at Limerick, with a Message ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to this purpose: That if the Lord President, would instantly
gather all the Forces he could make, and draw to Kilmallock, where
the Lady <hi>Margaret</hi> should meete him, for the receiving of one thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
pound, which was promised him, upon the delivery of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner;
praying withall, that the President would not moue out of
Kilmallock, untill she were come unto him; in the meane time hee
would keepe him in safetie, and accomodate all things for the more
assurance in the effecting of the busines.</p>
                     <p>To Kilmallock he came the next Morrow,<note place="margin">20. Iunij.</note> the twentieth of <hi>Iune,</hi>
with one thousand Foote, and two Troopes of Horse; for a good
part of his Armie was at that time gone into <hi>Thomond,</hi> to secure the
same from <hi>Odonnell,</hi> who was come farre up into the Countrey, and
had taken many preyes there.</p>

was so secretly caried, as the Earle of Thomond had no
notice of it, untill he was come to the Borders thereof;
hee then being at Limerick with the President, prayed
him to lend him part of his Armie, to make Head against
the Rebels: Whereupon his Lordship commanded the Sergeant
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:18000:44"/>

For the Noble Earle fought often with his Forces, slew many of
them, and never left them, untill he had recovered a great part of the
Cattle, which <hi>Odonnell</hi> had taken; And upon Mid-somer day, chased
him out of Thomond. This suddaine and unexpected comming
of <hi>Odonnell</hi> with such great Forces, as attended him, could never haue

<hi>Odonnell</hi> passed, and returned, without doing of any hurt that
ever I heard of:<note place="margin">Iames fits Thomas set at liberty.</note> And so leaving with this Digression, it is time to
speake of the Successe of the vsurping Earles apprehension. By this
time it was suspected, and publikely noised abroad, that the Sugan
Earle should bee delivered to the President; which Rumour began
first to bee bruited in Limerick, and Kilmallock; and (as it alwayes
hapneth in that Kingdome, from the Townes, the rumour is speedily
conveied into the Countrey; which being no sooner heard, then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved
by the Rebels, as well Provincials as others; they all combi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
themselues; <hi>Iohn fits Thomas, Pierce Lacy,</hi> and <hi>William Burke,</hi>
being the <hi>Triumviri</hi> of this League, to set the Prisoner at Libertie:
With this determination they had gathered together of <hi>Dermonds</hi>
Bonoghs and Provincials, some foure thousand men, nee re Castle
Leshin, in the great Fastnesse of Conniloe; for there was this Castle
seated, with intent both to blocke up the way, that the President
should take in comming thither, and to constraine the Ward to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the Earle.</p>
               <p>The President being at Kilmallock as aforesaid, hourely expecting
the comming of the Lady <hi>Margaret,</hi> stayed there from the twentieth
to the twentie sixth day,<note place="margin">26. Iunij.</note> and in all that time he never heard from her,
or her Husband: Vpon the twentie sixth the Lady <hi>Margaret</hi> came
to him, shee related that Castlelishin was besieged by the Rebels; her
cause of stay was, the danger of the way. Immediately the Presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
(notwithstanding, the rest of his Forces were not returned out
of Thomond) purposed to raise the Siedge; and the Armie being
drawen forth before they had marched an English mile upon the
way, they met a Messenger, who delivered unto them for certaine,
that <hi>Iames fits Thomas</hi> was rescued that morning, and himselfe did see
him out of the Castle.</p>
               <p>In Castlelishin, where <hi>Iames fits Thomas</hi> was prisoner, <hi>Dermond
O Conner</hi> (with the Ward) had left a Priest, whose perswasions pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed

I thought good to certifie your Honour, (assuring the same upon

your Honour shall understand manifestly heereafter) to the end your
Honour might bee advised not to send the Armie, for feare of any
mischance, in respect of the greatnesse of the Enemies forces, and
fastnesse of their strengths, the Earle being inlarged; all which I hope
to bring to a worse case then they were in, and that in a short time,
if I be well furthered by your Lordship: the manner whereof I am
ready to declare to your Honour, as occasion shall serue: for speedy
effecting whereof, I pray your Lordship to send me your best advice
by Captaine <hi>Power,</hi> the which expecting forthwith, I humbly take my
leaue:</p>

               <p>The reason which I conceiue mooved <hi>Dermond</hi> that hee did not
presently render him to the President, was partly his feare, that his
money would bee detained from him, when the prisoner was once
delivered, and therefore hee would bee first sure of the same; partly
his over much confidence in his men whom hee thought that they
would not for a world haue betrayed him as they did; but especially
I conceiue, that the danger of the way was the occasion of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction:
for undoubtedly the man did meane to performe his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
sincerely; and if the Lady could haue come sooner to Kilmal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locke,
the titularie Earle had been brought from Castlelishin with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any difficultie.</p>
               <p>Vpon the seven and twentieth <hi>Dermond O Conner</hi> wrote to the
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:18000:45"/>
President, praying to bee excused, that hee did not come unto him,
for the wayes were too dangerous for him to passe, untill his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
who was in Desmond with foure hundred men, did come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him, or that the Enemy did scatter, or the President with his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie
should draw into those parts; and in the meane while he would
remaine in the Castle where hee was; and besought the President to
send him a safeguard for himselfe, his followers, and goods, prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting
his loyaltie to her Majestie, and promising to bee directed by
the President in whatsoever it should please him to commaund.
Within a few dayes after the delivery of the Sugan Earle (as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said)
the Earle of Thomond having intercepted a Letter sent by the
Rebells of Mounster, to <hi>O Donnell</hi> and his Associates, did send the
same unto the President; whereby it may appeare, how much the
taking of <hi>Iames fits Thomas</hi> did grieue them at the heart, which is the

               <p>The President being out of hope, to get this Haggard into his

called <hi>O Conner Kerry)</hi> both being seated upon the River of Lime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick,
and so to passe the Mountaine into Kerry.</p>
               <p>The President having taken order for all such necessaries as should

the twentie nineth (upon a Letter which hee received from
<hi>Dermond O Conner</hi>) into the Hart of Conniloe, and incamped at a
Towne called Ballingery foureteene miles from Limerick, being by
him requested (who was now besieged by the Enemy in the Castle
of Balliallinan) to releeue him with her Majesties Forces.</p>
               <p>The President being advanced within three miles of the Castle,<note place="margin">Dermond O Conner and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels agreed, and reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.</note>
where <hi>Dermond O Conner</hi> was besieged, the Rebels understanding
thereof, and fearing to bee assailed by him, and loath that <hi>Dermond
O Conner</hi> should fall into his hands, to be imployed in service against
them, whose credit with the Bownoghs was such, as that hee could
perswade them to what he listed; they resolved to treate with <hi>Der<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond,</hi>
and upon his oath of future faith, to take him againe into their
societie, and to restore him to his former Command. <hi>Dermond</hi> (as it
should seeme, fearing that Reliefe would not come unto him in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
time) accepted the offer, and rendered the Castle and himselfe
into their hands: But yet I could never heare that <hi>Dermond</hi> after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
was had in any great estimation amongst them: This bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sines
being thus composed, they presently dislodged, with intent to
giue impediment to the Armie, in their passage towards the Glynne;
His Lordship being advertised of the reconcilement,<note place="margin">The Castle of Crome taken by the Armie.</note> directed his
March to the Glynne; and understanding that the Castle of Crome,
the Earle of Kildares inheritance, which was not much out of his
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:18000:46"/>
way, and held by a Ward left therein by <hi>Pierce Lacy,</hi> which gaue
great Annoiance to the Subjects thereabouts, and comfort to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels,
being seated at the entrance into Conniloe, tooke it in his way;
upon the sight of the Armie, the Warders quitted the Castle, and the
President possessed himselfe thereof, together with some store of
Corne, and other Provision, that was found therein. The last of
<hi>Iune,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">30. Iunij.</note> the Armie marched through Kerry, a safe Countrey, unto As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keiton,
where it remained foure dayes, in expectation of Victuals,
that should come thither from Limerick by Water: The fourth of
Iuly,<note place="margin">4. Iuly.</note> the Armie rose from thence, and marched to Ballintare, upon
the Mountaine of Sleughlogher, twelue miles from Askeiton; the
Enemy to the number of three thousand, marching all that day in
our view.</p>
               <p>Now did the President assure himselfe, that this Armie of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels
did onely attend the opportunitie for some place of advantage,
where they might conveniently attempt our Forces; and no doubt
so they would haue done, if the fore conceived Iealousie, and distrust
betweene the Provincials and Bonoghs, confirmed in them by the
bones of Dissention (that the President had cast forth amongst them)
had not wrought in either of them, a desire of nothing more, then to
be freed from the danger (reciprocally apprehended) each of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,

Whereas about <hi>May</hi> last, I came hither in my Galley out of

into my natiue soyle, there to liue quiet, and under her Majesties sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection,
whereupon I haue had her Highnesse protection and Passe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
for my selfe and them, and all other out of Connaght, that shall
accompany me; Whereby ever since my selfe and souldiers haue
been so crossed, and troubled by this Countrey people, as they did
not suffer me to depart from the Earle of Desmond; I have thought
good therefore, in respect it is a thing belonging to the advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of her Majesties service, to bring the number of one thousand
persons, souldiers and tenants to peace, to pray and desire your
Lordship to graunt mee, and all such as I shall bring with mee, your
Passeport and Safe-conduct through all your Garrisons, and her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties

               <p>Vnto these Letters the President deferred to returne any present
Answer, as well because they should know, that they who had at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted,
and performed so many outrages, and rebellious practises
against her Majestie and her Subjects, should not so presently and so
easily receiue favour from the State; as also they might haue imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
(if hee had instantly condiscended unto the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e their demaunds)
that he stood in feare of them, which might haue made them more
bold in attempting some enterprise upon his Armie. And lastly, he
conceived a hope, that to effect their longing desire of returning
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:18000:47"/>
into Connaght, they would at the last be glad to doe service one up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
another; remising therefore onely this Answer, that he despised
their Forces, and he knew they durst not interrupt his passage: Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthelesse
at further leasure, hee would consider of their demands:

Cannon, brought by water in a Boat of the Earle of Thomonds
from Limerick; and that night intrenched our selues, before the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle

whereupon hee was commanded to depart: He saw the Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non

put in pledge for his Loyaltie; then hee desired to speake with the

his obstinacie to be such, as he disdained to haue any long conference

conduct from the President, that he might come to speake with him,
which being granted, in his discourse to the Earle; my Lord (said he)
in the loue I beare you, being your naturall Follower, I desired to
speake with you, to the end that you may avoid the perill that you are
in; for the Earle of Desmond, and the Connaght men, lodge not
two miles from this place, they are three thousand strong at least, and
the Lord President may bee assured, that they will giue upon his
campe, for so they are resolved; and in all likelihood, you will bee
there put to the Sword, or driven into the River of Shenan. The
Earle deriding these threats, advised him to render up the Castle to
the President, whereby his life and his fellowes might be secured,
which he with vaine glorious obstinacie refused, and returned to the
Castle; for a Farewell, the President sent him word, that since he had
refused the Earle of Thomonds favourable offer, that he was in hope
before two dayes were spent, to haue his Head set upon a Stake,
which proved true (as you shall heare) before the Castle was taken.</p>
               <p>The next day,<note place="margin">8. Iulij.</note> when wee looked that the cannon should be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:18000:50"/>
to play, the Cannonniere found the Peece to be cloyed, all the art
and skill which either the Smith, or himselfe could or did use, prevai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
nothing. The President (who is a man that knowes well to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage
great Artillery) commanded that the peece upon her carryage
(as she was) should be abased at the tayle, and elevated at the musle,
as high as it might bee: then hee willed the Gunner to giue her a
full charge of powder, roule a shott after it, and to giue fire at the
mouth, whereby the touch-hole was presently cleared, to the great
rejoycing of the Armie, which of necessitie in attempting the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle,
(without the favour of the Cannon) must haue endured great
losse. This particular I thought good not to omitt, because it may
bee an Instruction to others, whensoever the like accident should
happen. The Peece being thus cleared, the President having the
Knight of the Valleyes eldest sonne, (a childe of sixe yeares olde) in
his hands, to terrifie the Warders, hee caused the child to be set up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the topp of one of the Gabions, sending them word, That they
should haue a faire marke to bestow their small shott upon: The
Constable returned answere, That the feare of his life should not
make them to forbeare to direct their Volleyes of shot to the batte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie:
for said he (in undecent termes not fit for me to write) the place
is open where he was borne, and the Knight may haue more sonnes.
The President not intending (as hee seemed) caused the Infant to
bee taken downe from the Gabion, knowing that the discharging
of the Cannon would haue shaken the poore childes bones in sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
and then presently hee commanded the battery to begin, and the
small shott did so incessantly burne powder, as the Warders durst not
stand to their fight,<note place="margin">A Breach made.</note> untill a breach was made assaultable into the Sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler
under the great Hall of the castle: all this was done with the losse

               <p>Then was Captaine <hi>Flower</hi> commaunded by the President, with
certaine Companies assigned vnto him, to enter the breach,<note place="margin">The breach assaulted.</note> which
hee valiantly performed, and gained the Hall, and enforced the Ward
to returne into a Castle close adjoyning unto it, where from out of a

staires, to gaine two turrets over the Hall, in which attempt Captaine
<hi>Bostocks</hi> Ensigne was slaine; by the winning whereof, they were
in better securitie then before, and there were our Colours placed;
and because it was by this time within night, Captaine <hi>Slings by,</hi>
(who was there with the Presidents Companie) was commaunded
to make it good till the morning; during which time, some whiles
on either side, small shott played, but little or no harme done: about
midnight the Constable seeing no possibilitie to resist long, and no
hope of mercy left, thought by the favour of the night in a sally<note place="margin">A sally made by the rebels.</note> to

morning, the Ward was gotten into the Tower of the Castle, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
there was no comming unto them, but up a narrow stayre,
which was so strait, as no more then one at once might ascend;
and at the staire foot, a strong wooden doore, which being burnt,
the smoke in the staires was such, as for two howers there was no
ascending without hazard of stifling; when the extremitie of the
smoake was past, one of the Rebels presented himselfe, and said in
the behalfe of himselfe and his fellowes, That if their liues might
be saved, they would render; but before any answere was made, he
voluntarily put himselfe into our hands: The smoake being vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed,
a Muskettier, and to his second a Halbardier; Then Captaine

Connaght, seconded by others, ascended the staires in file, where
they found no resistance, nor yet in the upper roomes, for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels
were all gone to the Battlements of the Castle, with resolution
to sell their liues as deare as they could. Our men pur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the other; the gutters were very narrow betweene the Roofe of the
Castle and the Battlements: In conclusion, some were slaine in the
place, and others leapt from the top of the Castle into the water un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneath
it, where our Guards killed them. In this Service eleven
Souldiers were slaine, whereof one was an Ensigne, and one and
twentie hurt, of which number the Serjeant Major, (who served
admirably well) was one; hee received three or foure wounds, but
none of them mortall; there was also the Lieutenants of the Earle
of <hi>Thomond,</hi> and Sir <hi>Henry Powers</hi> hurt; of the enemy (of all sorts)
were slaine 80, or thereabouts, whereof 23 were naturall borne fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers
to the Knight of the Valley, in whom hee reposed greatest
confidence.</p>
               <p>The reasons which mooved the Knight thus obstinately to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist,

                  <note place="margin">Sixty of the Bonoghs slaine by the Lo. Burke.</note> being either ignorant of what

two Elder Brothers deaths, who were slaine by them, with the

were passing the Shenan, and slew sixtie of them, besides divers that
were drowned; and tooke some part of their Prey: In this skir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish,
an Alderman of Limericke called <hi>Dominicke Roche,</hi> and a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant,
was dangerously wounded with a Musket Bullet; among
these Bownoghs, <hi>Dermond O Conner</hi> passed into Connaght: Whilest
these things were thus in handling, the President still remained at
Carrigofoile, expecting daily and hourely a Ship of Victuals, which
had bin comming from Corke thither, since the beginning of Iune;
upon arrivall whereof, hee purposed with the greatest part of his
Forces to haue passed further into Kerry, and to haue setled that part
of the Province.</p>
               <p>But the Victuals by reason of contrary Winds, not being as yet
come into the River of Shenan; the thirteenth of this Moneth, hee
was constrained for want thereof, to returne to Limericke againe.<note place="margin">The Lord Presidents returne to Limerick.</note>
In which returne, we having marched through exceeding strong

whereof, <hi>Florence Mac Cartie</hi> was imployed as a principall

the President, he would be glad to saue their liues; and if they would
deliver up the place to him, hee would undertake to convey them in
safetie to Carrigofoile: Much did this smoth report, distract some of
the Wards; for they well understood, that he had not shewed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
in any overt action against her Majestie, since the President came
into his government; and although he did converse with the Rebels,
yet it might bee, that it was either to doe some service upon them, or
else to draw them into subjection. But others misdoubting, <hi>Anguis

But finding that this last attempt, prevailed no more then the

sent Letters of Comfort and Encouragement, aswell to <hi>Florences</hi> as
to the rest of the Lords in that Province; assuring them, not only of
succours from himselfe, but farther, that the Spanish Forces would

Traitors, and their goods, which were reported to bee neere unto
Sir <hi>Walter Raleigh</hi> his Lands, adjoyning to the White Knights Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
with seventie Foote and foure and twentie Horse, marched that
night one and twentie miles from Moyallo; and at the breake of
day, our men thinking, that they had beene brought upon an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
Towne, set fier to a House, having some few people therein:
But an old Souldier knowing the place, told the Captaine that it was
the White Knights Towne: Whereupon he commanded his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
to forbeare committing any outrage, either upon the people, or
any of their Goods: But the White Knights younger Sonne, <hi>Iohn fits
Gibbon,</hi> having suddenly gathered to himselfe, one hundred and sixty
Foote and eighteene Horse, overtooke Captaine <hi>Haruy;</hi> who began
to excuse the matter, telling him (as the truth was) that the Guid
whom he had there with him, to answer the Fact, had brought him
unwillingly upon that place; and therefore for the hurt done (igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantly)
he would make a large satisfaction.</p>
               <p>But the young man following the advise of one <hi>Garret Mac Shane,</hi>
(who had lately beene a notable Traitor) thinking it not possible
for so small a Company to resist his great Force;<note place="margin">The White Knights Sonne defea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</note> (without returning
any answer) began presently to chardge our men, whom they sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
without any great resistance to haue at their mercie, and came
up close to our Foote, who nothing dismaied, stood firme, expecting
their Chardge: But they not comming on, Captaine <hi>Harvy</hi> advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced

foure were hurt, but none killed; Captaine <hi>Harvy</hi> received a shot on
his Murrian, a blow with a pike upon his back, but escaped danger by
the goodnesse of his Buffe Coat, and had his Horse slaine under him.
The White Knight upon dew knowledge hereof, condemned both
his Sonne and people for their folly, to enforce a fight, having no
harme intended them; and confessed they were well lost. But yet
for his better satisfaction the treacherous Guid, who did upon a set
purposed malice draw this Draught, was by the Presidents appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,

of his comming, and bee a meanes to alienate their hearts
from the counterfeit <hi>Desmond.</hi> The vigilant care that Sir <hi>Charles
Wilmot</hi> used within his charge, having taken divers preyes, and
killed some of the Rebels, together with this Invention, caused most
of the Free-holders of that Countrey to submitt themselues, and
seeke unto the Governour for her Majesties protection: the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall
amongst these was <hi>William fits Gerald,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Knight of Kerry, &amp; the Lord of Lixnaw made suite to be protected.</note> commonly called The
Knight of Kerry, who by Messengers signified the great desire that
hee conceived to live a Subiect, and had present occasion to shew
some proofe thereof; for the Sugan Earle comming about this time
to the Dingle, the said Knight would by no meanes receiue him
into his Castle; whereupon hee ruined all the houses that were
standing in the Towne, and so tooke his journey unto Castle Mange:
<hi>Thomas fits Maurice,</hi> (the pretended Baron of Lixnaw) also now
newly come to his Barronie by the death of his father, sought by
meanes of his wife, (who was Sister to the Earle of Thomond) for
the Presidents favour, and her Majesties protection: Both were
promised upon condition, hee would performe such service as
might in some good sort deserue the same: but this hee absolutely
refused, because (forsooth) it stood not with his Conscience, nor
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:18000:57"/>
with his Honour: for these were his owne words in a Letter that
hee wrote to my Lord of Thomond: and upon this Answere the
President rejected both the man and his suit.</p>
               <p>The affaires of Kerry succeeding so well with the Governour, it
was supposed, that the reputed Earle of Desmond would not long
remaine in these parts, lest the Protectees might offer him some
false measure; which if it should happen, most likely it was that
hee would passe the Mountaine, and shelter himselfe in the Fastnes
of Conniloe, and therefore the Lord President intreated the Earle of
Thomond, to stay with the Garrison at Askeiton,<note place="margin">The Earle of Thomo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d left to command the garrison at Askeiton.</note> both to doe ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
upon such Rebels as should lurke in those woods, as also to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
the goods of those that were newly become Subjects; for (as
the manner of the Irish) had they lost but twentie Cowes, or tenne
Garrans, they would haue held it sufficient cause to haue relapsed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine.
My Lord of <hi>Thomond</hi> therefore lying there in Garrison, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
advertisement by certaine espialls (whom hee used) that <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
Mac Cartie</hi>

was, to implore ayde of that Egyptian Reed, to underprop their
ruinous, and almost rotten Building. Of this new and late combi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
the Lord President was also advertised by the Lord <hi>Barrie,</hi>
That <hi>Iames Mac Thomas,</hi> to assure <hi>Florence</hi> unto him, did giue him
these Lands and Rents following:<note place="margin">Lands given by Iames fits Thomas to Flor. Mac Cartie.</note>

place of meeting (where this Agreement was made) was at Rahi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemroeg,
bordering upon Slewlogher. Vpon this Intelligence the
Governour of Kerry, by direction from the President, received into

deprived of that promotion, and both the Title and Lands by him

               <p>The President having disposed of his Garrisons in such sort, that

from the Rebels; the rather because the great Ordnance, a
Cannon, and a Culverin being left there by the Earle of Essex,
were now possessed by the Rebels. This Item from the Lord De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putie,
spurred on the President without further delay, to take order

Cahir, to repaire unto him, who (as before you haue heard) was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemently

him to deale with <hi>Iames Butler</hi> (nicknamed <hi>Iames Galde</hi>)
his Brother, about the redelivering thereof to Her Majesties use; but
his Answer was, that so little interest had hee in his Brother, as the
meanest Follower in all his Countrie, might prevaile more with
him then himselfe; (for hee was unwilling to haue the Castle regai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by the State, except it might againe, be left wholly to him, as it
was before the first winning thereof) which the President surmising
told him, that if it might speedily be yeelded up unto him, he would
become an humble Suiter to the Lord Deputie (in his behalfe) for
the repossessing thereof; otherwayes hee would presently march
with his whole Armie into those parts, and taking the same by force,
he would ruine and raze it to the very foundation; and this he bound
with no small protestations: Hereupon, Iustice Comerford being
dispatched away with the Lord of Cahir, they prevailed so farre
with young <hi>Butler,</hi> that the Castle upon the twentie nineth follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
was delivered to the State; as also, all the Munitions, and the

               <p>The nine and twentieth<note place="margin">29 August.</note> the Lord President, among other things

               <p>While these things were in handling, it hapned that a French Barke
arrived at Dingle, laden with Wine and some Munition, which they
sold to the Rebels, and thereby ministred unto them no small reliefe,
being before in great want thereof. Whereupon the President wrote
his Letters to the Lords of Her Majesties Privie Councell, intreating

you know that of long time your Lordship hath been suitor to the

the assent of the Church, and us the Nobilitie of this Action, your

so as it is very bootlesse for any of us all to seeke their favours, or

Kingdome could not long stand, hee would not in person joyne
with them, but sent word to the white Knight by his daughter
(<hi>Donogh Mac Cormock</hi> his wife) that rather then the Action should
fall to the ground, hee would himselfe make a journey into Spaine,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:18000:60"/>
to intreat ayd and assistance from the Pope and Spanish King: but
in the meane time, the supposed Earle being still pursued by Sir
<hi>Charles,</hi> is constrained to abandon Kerry, to goe to Conniloe, and so
to Arlogh; in which passage hee sustained such a losse (as shall bee
said) which prooved to him irrecoverable. There was not left any
man of esteeme likely to defend the Action, but <hi>Florence Mac Cartie,</hi>
(lately spoken of) who having temporized all this while, (to see this
Summers prosecution) was growne by other mens examples to bee
more wise then honest, became now an Intercessor to the President,
with frequent Letters, and damnable oathes, that he was in his heart
and intentions sincerely devoted to her Majesties service.</p>
               <p>The concurrence of this fortunate successe, did promise a present
reduction of the Province, and an establishment thereof in a setled
quiet, and so no doubt it would haue prooved, if the Protectees had
meant in their hearts, as they professed with their tongues: but it
was farre otherwayes, for the President did at this time receiue cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
advertisement, that the titularie Earle being driven to great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremitie,
and eagerly prosecuted in all corners, by the consent (in
common Counsell) of his associates, whereof some of them had
never beene in actuall rebellion, and others lately protected, and see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
to forsake him (notwithstanding their pledges in her Majesties
hands) haue advised him partly for his safetie, but especially to make
triall what ayd hee could procure (out of Connaght and Vlster) to
depart from thence, with confident promises, that whensoever hee
should returne with new Forces, that then they would as constant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
stand for him as heeretofore: Whence by the way may bee dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
the cankred disposition of their malicious hearts towards
the English Government, who nothing regard the disease of their
Persons, the losse of their Goods, the hazzard of their Liues, and
danger of their perjured Soules, so that they may bee able to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
in action against her Majestie; hoping thereby that at the length
shee would growe wearie of her extreame charges, and by that

and Exercise thereof under the Romish Authoritie, which they
striue to haue supreame; and what kind of subjection can bee ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
at the hands of any such Papists, may appeare, for that some of

whom intelligence was brought upon Tuesday being the sixteenth
of <hi>September,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">16. Sept.</note> that the Rebells <hi>Iames fits Thomas,</hi> and his complices,
were that day to passe from Conniloe, to the huge Fastnesse of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logh:
Whereupon Captaine <hi>Greame</hi> instantly drew forth (with his
Troope) towards the said Fastnesse; Order being likewise taken,
that the Foot should hasten after with all possible speed; Captaine
<hi>Greame</hi> making extraordinary haste, suddenly espied their Forces
somewhat neere the wood; but before they could recover the same,
hee gaue them a Charge, and at the very first possessed himselfe of
their Carriage, and killed all those that guarded the same: Heere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
the Rebells (having foure Colours) in defence of their Carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age,
drew towards him, and gaue him a charge, which hee an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered
with his Horse; and by this time a Sergeant of Captaine
<hi>Dillons,</hi> with some light shott, were come up, and delivered a Vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley
in their teeth, which killed divers of them, and slewe <hi>Pierce

their Battalion home to the Colours, which they resisted; but at
his second charge, he brake cleane through them, and they betooke
themselues to running, and our men to killing; and surely had not
our Horse been over-wearied with their long forrey before they
came to fight, and our Foot tyred and out of breath to come up,
there had not one man escaped aliue: But as it was, there were
slaine at this skirmish of the Rebells, at least one hundred and

with the crie of the people, and noise of the shot and drummes.
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:18000:62"/>
The greatest losse that wee sustained was in Horse; for Captaine
<hi>Greame</hi> lost sixteene Horse, the Lord <hi>Audley</hi> had a Serjeant slaine,
and there were sixe more wounded, but not mortally; one of Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine

the Captaine perceiving, he stooped downe to reach the Colours, but
at an instant receiving a blowe with a Peece upon the reines of
his backe, vvas not able to recover them, being rescued with sixe
Pike-men.</p>
               <p>This Disaster proved so fatall to the vsurping Earle, that although
of the sixe hundred Foote hee brought with him, foure hundred did
still remaine able to fight; yet could hee never afterward gather one
hundred of these to a Head; for some gat into Connaght, some into
Vlster, and in fine, every man to his owne home, leaving the Earle
to a desperate fortune; who now perceived that the Provincials sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
themselues daily to the President, and the strangers returned
into their severall Countries; and that no aide approached either
from the South or North, by Sea, nor Land, was compelled toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

she refused to come to his Bed, untill he had reconciled himselfe to

that Earledome from her Highnesse; and though she be not pleased
to bestow the same wholly upon her, yet she doubted not to obtaine
some part thereof; but if neither of these could bee gotten, yet was
not she minded to goe a begging either unto Vlster nor into Spaine;

               <p>Her Majestie having evermore had a determination,<note place="margin">The young Earle of Desmond arrived at Yoghall.</note> to send <hi>Iames

                     <p>wee greet you well:
Wee haue now at the last resolved to send over
<hi>Iames fits Gerald</hi> into Mounster, after long
debate with Our selfe what accidents might
follow thereupon; wherein although there
might be many doubts, to what hee may bee inveagled in times
to come, yet that opinion which wee conceiue of his owne good
nature and disposition to gratefulnesse, for this high benefit
which hee receiveth, together with the orderly course which we
intend shall bee observed in the raysing, and disposing his For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
doeth make us lesse doubtfull of that mischiefe, then wee
are for the present of some other scorne, which we shall receiue,
if by our sending him over, and your resolution to restore him, no
such effect should follow, as might be answerable to that which
is expected: In which consideration, although we know there
are many of Opinion, that the way to draw greatest things by
him, were to raise him high at first (because it will make those
cleaue to him the faster) yet will we follow therein Our owne
resolution, which is rather to proceed in such a case by degrees,
then in any suddaine, without reasonable caution and reserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
For the first step therefore, wee haue now sent him over
by Captaine <hi>Price,</hi> (a trustie and discreet Person) to deliver
him safely into your hands, whereas wee know the keeping of
him in any state of a Prisoner, would wholly overthrow the
worke, and multiply the jealousies of those who judge all others
by themselues; So in respect that you are in place where all cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances
are clearest knowen, and that the change of causes
altereth Councels: Know this from Vs, That we shall never
disallow it, if you in your discretion finde it necessarie (at any
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:18000:64"/>
time) that you doe abridge him of any libertie, or any favour
now afforded him: For as wee haue much the rather assented
to send him over, and place him there, because you haue had
your part in the Counsell: So doe wee referre the managing of
him to your discretion: for his maintenance during his abode
there, there are but two wayes, the one to bestow Lands vpon
him with an habitation: the other to maintaine him out of
our owne purse with a pension. In the first there must be time to
consider where to seat him: for the second, because it is a thing
that must be done, and that he must be maintained with a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
attendance, that they may not scorne him, and that hee
hath one or two sisters, whom we had rather should depend vpon
himselfe, then bee matched with any other that were ill affected,
(whereof many there bee that would bee glad to fortifie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
by them.) Wee doe heereby giue you order, to peruse
the Numbers you haue, and where you finde any unprofitable
Captaine that hath a weake band, that you doe presently ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shiere
the same, and to imploy part of that charge, which was
formerly bestowed in that Band, towards the maintenance of
him and his, as you shall see requisite, without further charging
vs, and the same to continue, vntill wee may see how to resolue
of some convenient Habitation for him, that they may see hee
is to bee seated amongst them, with a competent portion of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,
where he may be a stay to Our service. And now because
wee know the Countrey will thinke him unlikely to stead them
that shall follow him, if they bee not assured that hee shall haue
the Title, (which is a matter they doe so much affect to follow)
Wee haue heerewith sent you a Patent of his Earledome, to
the intent that you may assure all that are diffident of our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance;
and yet Wee can be content, they plainely doe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
also, that if they shall not actually, and substantially
performe those Services, which may deserue this extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
clemencie, and giue us cause to consummate the rest: Wee
both can and will quickly recall all that is hitherto perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med:
for which purpose wee doe heereby commaund you, to
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:18000:65"/>
advertise Vs, what is effected for him, by this demonstratiue
acte of Ours, and then to receiue our pleasure, before the
Patent bee delivered out of your handes; although for the
present you may let it bee shewed to any such persons as you
shall see cause, to assure by viewe of the same, and thereby
make them perceiue how vnjustly Wee haue beene slaundered,
by those that should possesse the world, that Wee haue no desire
or end, but to extirpate as well the Innocent, as the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
of that Nation, seeing Wee are contented to rayse
the Sonne of that Father, that had committed so notorious
crimes. For as much as Wee doe hold it convenient, that
the Archbishopp of Cassell should not bee in any sort kept in
extremitie: Wee would haue you convert tenne dead payes of
Foote to his use, parcell of that hundred which is appoynted
to bee cashiered for the maintenance of <hi>Iames Fits Gerald;</hi>
Wherein likewise Wee would haue consideration helde of
poore, and some maintenance for the wife of <hi>Dermond O
Conner;</hi> All these allowances to bee borne by the Cashiering
of that Companie, and to bee ordered according to your dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion,
because Wee would not haue apparant penury to sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize
any of these that haue entered so deepely, although the
fruites are yet ungathered, which is the time when they must
bee further rewarded. Wee haue likewise given order to the
Deputie, to make an allowance of fortie shillings a weeke to
the Archbishop, in nature of Dead Payes to Preachers, in
lieu whereof hee may stay the pension of some other, who is not
so necessarie to be provided for: Having now assented to doe
that you haue advised, Wee leaue it to be ordered according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to your discretion, assuring you, that wee are still of opinion,
if you use not this Patent well, that they will bee lesse greedy to
dispatch any businesse for Vs, then they would haue beene, if we
had not gone on so hastily with theirs: But wee repose such
trust in you, as we thinke our Honour and safetie of that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
in safe hands, for so much as faith and discretion can se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure,
to whom wee render condigne thankes for the good proofe
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:18000:65"/>
you haue hitherto made of them both. The Bishop is not vnfit
to frequent the young Gentleman; and therefore, that credit
which is fit, let him haue, and let your proofe of his zeale, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse
other of his indiscretions.</p>

               <p>It was thought by all men, that the comming of this young Lord
into Ireland, would haue bred a great alteration in the Province, and
an absolute revolt of all the old Followers of the House of <hi>Desmond</hi>
from <hi>Iames fits Thomas,</hi> but it proved of no such consequence: For
the President to make triall of the disposition and affection of the
young Earles kindred and Followers, at his desire consented that hee
should make a Iourney from Moyallo into the Countie of Lime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick,
accompanied with the Archbishop of Cashell, and Master <hi>Boyle</hi>
Clearke of the Councell (a person whom the Lord President did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:18000:66"/>
much trust and confidence in, and with whom he then commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated,
and advised about his most secret and serious affaires of that
Government;) And to Master <hi>Boyle</hi> his Lordship gaue secret charge,
aswell to obserue the Earles waies and cariage, as what men of quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
or others made their addresse unto him, &amp; with what respects and
behaviour they caried themselues towards the Earle; who came to
Kilmallock upon a Saturday in the Evening, and by the way, and at
their entry into the Towne, there was a mighty concourse of people,
insomuch as all the Streets, Doores and Windowes, yea the very
Gutters and tops of the Houses were so filled with them, as if they
came to see him, whom God had sent to bee that Comfort and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light,
their foules and hearts most desired, and they welcomed him
with all the expressions and signes of Ioy, every one throwing upon
him Wheat and Salt (an ancient Ceremony vsed in that Province, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Election of their new Majors and Officers) as a Prediction of
future peace and plenty: That night the Earle was inv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> to
Sir <hi>George Thorntons,</hi> who then kept his House in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap>
and although the Earle had a Co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ard of Souldiers, which
made a Lane from his lodgings to Sir <hi>George Thornetons</hi> 
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> yet
the confluence of people that flockt thither to see him was so great, as
in halfe an houre he could not make his passage thorough the crowd;
and after Supper he had the like encountere at his returne to his lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
The next day being Sunday, the Earle went to Church to heare
divine Service; and all the way his Countrey people vsed loud &amp; rude
dehortations to keepe him from Church, unto which he lent a dease
eare; but after Service and the Sermon was ended, the Earle comming
forth of the church, was railed at, &amp; spet upon by those that before his
going to Church were so desirous to see and salute him: Insomuch, as
after that publike expression of his Religion, the Towne was clee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
of that multitude of strangers, and the Earle from thence forward,
might walke as quietly and freely in the Towne, as little in effect
followed or regarded as any other private Gentleman: This true
relation I the rather make, that all men may obserue how hatefull
our Religion and the Professors thereof, are to the ruder and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
sort of people in that Kingdome: For from thence forward
none of his Fathers followers, (except some few of the meaner sort
of Free-holders) resorted unto him; and the other great Lords in
Mounster, who had evermore beene overshadowed by the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of <hi>Desmond,</hi> did rather feare then wish the advancement of the
young Lord: But the trueth is, his Religion, being a Protestant, was
the onely cause that bred this coynesse in them all: for if hee had
been a Romish Catholike, the hearts and knees of all degrees in the
Province would haue bowed unto him: Besides, his comming was
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:18000:67"/>
not well liked by the Vndertakers, who were in some jealousie, that
in after times he might be restored to his Fathers Inheritances, and
thereby become their Lord, and their Rents (now payed to the
Crowne) would in time be conferred upon him. These conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
assured the President, that his personall being in Mounster
would produce small effects, but onely to make tryall what pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
hee had.</p>

of Castle Mange, a Castle of her Majesties, in the

shee had a Ward surprised by the supposed <hi>Desmond,</hi>

which by his negotiation with the said Constable, was at last
rendred unto him, together with <hi>Pierce Lacie</hi> his two sonnes,
which were kept as pledges therein; and this was all the service
that hee did or could doe, during his abode in Ireland: And that

and overthrow: for at the very instant when <hi>Thomas Oge</hi> (who
had the keeping of Castle Mange, and <hi>Pierce Lacies</hi> sonnes as pled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges

oathes and vowes that any Christian could be obliged by) gott
some secret hint that Castle Mange was by <hi>Thomas Oge</hi> to be yeelded
up to her Majestie; who well foreseeing what reputation it would
bring to <hi>Desmond,</hi> and how much it would make up towards the
hastening of his owne ruine, if that Fort were once regained, and
an English Garrison placed there, he presumed, and that in the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidents
owne house, where he was so graciously used and entertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
to write his effectuall and earnest Letters to the said <hi>Thomas Oge,</hi>
assuring him, that <hi>Redmond Burke,</hi> and Captaine <hi>Tirrell</hi> were on
their way with great Forces to set Mounster on fire againe, disswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
him from keeping his promise with the President and the
young Earle of Desmond, promising, and binding his promises with
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:18000:67"/>
damnable oathes, that he would presently revictuall the Ward of
Castle Mange for three moneths, pay them the Arrear of all their
vvages, and that he would giue <hi>Thomas Oge</hi> and his Heires for ever,
six Plowlands of his owne Inheritance, so he would not deliver up
Castle Mange. And these Letters were by the watchfulnesse of
Master <hi>Boyle</hi> intercepted and delivered to the President. And from
thenceforward after <hi>Florence</hi> knew his Letters were intercepted,
and his treacheries more and more discovered. But all this while
it was a world to see how <hi>Florence</hi> plaied fast and loose,<note place="margin">The Ing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gling of Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence Mac Cartie.</note> betweene
the President and the Governour of Kerry: For when the President
sent to haue him come to him, then he answered, that he was within
few dayes to meete with the Governour of Kerry by a former ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment;
if Sir <hi>Charles</hi> sent for him, then he was shortly to repaire
to the President, and so deluding both, he would come to neither:
His stay was (as we haue shewed) because he purposed to stand out,
and for that cause had the last Moneth before planted as it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported,
some number of Bownoghs in his Countrey; but the gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors
people, upon one side, and these his Bownoghs on the other side,
had by this time so harried and consumed his Countrey, as he found
the same unable longer to maintaine his Mercenaries; and therefore
delayed with good words to gaine longer time, for it was common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
spoken among the Protectees, and Captaine <hi>Taffe</hi> wrote so much
to the President from Kilkenny, that <hi>Redmond Burke</hi> and Captaine
<hi>Tirrell,</hi> with all the Forces they could gather in Connaght, and Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,
would make an other incursion into Mounster, so soone as the
Lord Deputie should returne from the North, which was expected
very shortly, because the time of the yeare would breed many diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties
and inconveniences in his longer stay: Whether it were this
bruite, or the hearking after a Ship, to arriue in those parts, which
might transport him beyond Seas, that occasioned his delatory excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
I know not; But sure I am, that they proceeded not from any
loyall or dutifull mind.</p>
               <p>The beggerly Earle in the meane time, lurked in the Woods with
some two or three in his Company, sometimes in Arlogh, sometimes
in Drumfinnin, but most in the Countie of Typperrarie, where hee
had much kindred by his Mothers side: The President had intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
every day where hee lodged the night before, but never untill
he was departed, and had left the place; not but that the Countrey
could haue reported aswell where he is, as where he had beene, but
they were possessed with such a superstitious folly, &amp; so terrified with
the Priests Thunderbolts of Excommunication; as they adjudged
him unavoidably damned, that should ruinate such a principall Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler
of the Catholike action: And <hi>Fits Maurice</hi> was in little better
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:18000:68"/>
case; for although since his returne into Mounster, himselfe with the
Knight of the Glyn, had assembled some fower score in the Fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of Clanmorris, who guarded their Corne that should maintaine
them for the yeere following: Yet Sir <hi>Charles Wilmot</hi> marching
twelue miles through their Woods, being directed by a trusty Guid,
came suddenly upon them, and slew sixtie of them; the two Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pals
escaping very narrowly: After the killing ended they scow<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ed
the Woods, and finding great store of Corne therein, they burnt the
same, and returned with the Armes of all the dispersed Kerne. <hi>Pierce
Lacy</hi> had so well bestirred himselfe in his negotiation, with those of
Ormond and Ossery, that of the Ormond and Ossery men, with the
Purcels &amp; Omaghers, he had reinforced himselfe with fiue hundred
men, and being now joyned with <hi>Redmond Burke,</hi> who had one
thousand Foote and sixtie Horse (as was credibly informed) drew
their Forces into <hi>O Carrels</hi> Countrey, threatning daily) to invade the
small Countie of Limerick, which bordered upon them, but their
stay (as was reported) depended upon the returne of <hi>Iohn of Des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond,</hi>
who was expected with Forces out of the North. But <hi>Tyrone</hi>
was so well set a worke, by the honourable, painefull, and prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
proceedings of the Lord Deputie, as hee had enough to doe in
defending his owne Countrey, much lesse could he spare any Forces
for other parts.</p>
               <p>In September last, mention is made that the Lords of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell
had promised to send unto the President sixe hundred Foote for
the supplying of his Armie,<note place="margin">Supplies of men &amp; appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell sent into Mounster.</note> which accordingly arrived at Corke, as

indisposition of his body (as <hi>Florence</hi> protested) he left two others;
the one his base Brother, who had spent many yeeres in France,

the one was, that hereby he might draw from <hi>Florence</hi> this great

                     <p>RIght Honourable, I doubt not the detestable and apparant
wrong, that the Earle of Clanrickard hath done mee, is
manifestly knowen to your Lordship already, as I need not larger
to expresse it; but this I am sure, that the tolleration thereof, and that
I would not otherwayes bin caused to runne this course, and if there
were any hope of redresse, that I would long ere this be a Subject,
and will now shew my selfe worthy to be accepted, if I be entertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
and my Fathers Lands seized into your Honours hands, till my
Title be tryed; This Countrey of Ely being in your Honours Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince,
is a parcell to whom I make claime, wherein I would expect
your Honour to right me first: And thus requesting your Honour
to accept my service, and favour my right, I take leaue.</p>

Traytors, and also her Majesties inclimation was no way
bent to extend her mercie unto them: The reasons which mooved
him to sue for this Generall Pardon, was principally the multitudes
of the protected persons, who living from time to time upon
protection, were not so assured to the State as they would bee, if
they were pardoned; whereby the Government received much impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diment:
and besides, there were many poore women and children,
that had no abilitie to be at the charge of suing foorth of their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons;
and lastly, it was much desired by the Provincials themselues:
Neverthelesse he added this caution, that if any of the Protectees did
in this interim doe any treasonable act, that the President, with some
foure or fiue of the Councell of the Province joyned with him,
might haue power to denie them the benefit thereof, and also that
Priests, and Romish religious persons, (which were the first inei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of the Rebellion, and the continuall fomenters of the same)
should likewise bee excepted. The opinion of the President had
good allowance in England; yet for some private respects of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moditie
to Officers, (as it may bee imagined) the motion of a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
Pardon tooke not the effect desired; but afterward, (as you shall
heare) there was order given, that all such as the President would
recommend, should haue the favour to sue out their Pardons.</p>
               <p>In the beginning of <hi>November,</hi> a strong castle in Connilogh (which

finding no other meanes to compasse the same, determined to

requesting his advice and allowance therein, who returned answer,
That hee desired nothing more, then to haue that Castle gotten for
the Queene, and for the manner, left the managing thereof wholly
to his discretion. He sate downe before it upon the fifth of Novem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,<note place="margin">5. Novemb.</note>
                  <pb n="98" facs="tcp:18000:72"/>
attempting to get it by a Myne; in the which after hee had
wrought fiue or sixe dayes, and brought it underneath the Castle
wall, being ready to make a bed for the placing of the powder, sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainly
the spring brake foorth in such abundance, as that worke be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
fruitlesse: thereupon new ground was sought, which proved
good, the foundation of the Castle was undermined, as farre as the
middest of the Seller, which the Ward perceiving, made humble suit
to bee permitted to depart with their liues, which Sir <hi>Charles</hi> abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
refused; but if they would simply render themselues, the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
and all things in it to his discretion, hee would then stay further
proceeding in his worke, otherwise they might looke within very
few howers to bee blowen up. The Ward vvhich were eighteene
in number, came forth, and upon their knees submitted themselues
unto him, whom hee caused to bee apprehended; the women and
small children hee suffered to depart, of the weaponed men he han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
nine, so many of ours being lost at the Siege, which continued
more then three weekes; the residue hee detained, untill he had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
the President with all these accidents, who gaue present or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
for the execution of the rest; for they had beene all of them for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
protected, except one Sir <hi>Dermond Mac Brodie,</hi> a Priest, whose
life was saved upon this occasion: It fortuned that within this Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle,
at the rendring thereof, there was unknowen to Sir <hi>Charles,</hi> the
Lord of Lixnawes eldest sonne, being a child of fiue yeares of age;
the Warders upon their comming footh, disarrayed this child of all
his cloathes, and having besmeared his face with dust and durt, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
him to an old woman, who bringing the Infant naked and
disfigured at her backe, conveyed him away without suspition. Sir
<hi>Charles</hi> receiving advertisement of this escape, sent out some Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers,
and some Provincialls, (vvhom he most trusted) for the reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verie
of him, but in vaine they all returned vvith lost labour: at last
hee bethought himselfe, that peradventure some of the prisoners
could direct him in the pursuit, and questioning the Priest concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the Child: Hee answered, that he could best resolue him, for
that himselfe had given direction to the vvoman where shee should
bestow the child, till shee might deliver him to his Father: Why
then, saith Sir <hi>Charles,</hi> will you not conduct mee to him? Know
you not, that it is in my power to hang you, or to saue you? Yes,
and I assure you, if you will not guide mee to the place where hee
lieth hidden, I vvill cause you to bee instantly hanged: The Priest
answered, That it was all one to him, whether hee dyed this day,
or to morrow; but yet if hee might haue his Word, for the sparing
of his owne life, and the childes, hee would reveale his knowledge;
otherwayes the Governour might doe his pleasure. Sir <hi>Charles,</hi>
                  <pb n="99" facs="tcp:18000:72"/>
though very unwilling to graunt the Priest his life, yet the earnest
desire hee had to gett the child into his hands, caused him to agree
thereto. The Priest being put into a Hand-locke, is sent with a
Captaine, and a good Guard of Souldiers about this businesse, who
guided them to a Wood sixe miles from the Castle, by reason of
thicke bryers and thornes, almost unpassible, in the middest where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
there is a hollow Cave within the ground, not much unlike by
description to <hi>Cacus</hi> his denne, or the mouth of <hi>Avernus,</hi> in vvhich
desolate place they found that old vvoman, and this young childe,
whom they brougt to the Governour, and the Priest and childe

all the Lord of Lixnaw his goods, besides store of provision for
the Warre, vvho were plentifully provided for sixe moneths with
such kind of victuall as the Countrey yeeldeth; and it was said, that
the Baron himselfe would haue set up his rest in this Castle, which
he held impregnable against any force, (the Cannon excepted;) but it
should seeme his heart failed him, no lesse then his expectation. While
these things were in doing, Sir <hi>Richard Percy</hi> drew his Company
forth of Kinsale into Kinalmekagh,<note place="margin">A prey taken in Kinalme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kagh.</note> and there tooke a prey of two
hundred Cowes, and got the killing of some Rebels.</p>
               <p>In the beginning of this Moneth <hi>William fits Gerald,</hi> the Knight of
Kerry, came to the President with a Letter in his favour from Sir
<hi>Charles Wilmot,</hi> dated the thirtieth of October, wherein he witnessed
for him, that (ever since he was received under protection) hee had
demeanded himselfe, not onely like a good Subject, in doing no harme,
but that he had endeavoured (to his uttermost) to annoy the Enemy,
and had lately in token of his obedience, delivered unto Sir <hi>Charles</hi>
his Castle at the Dingle:<note place="margin">The Castle of the Dingle rendred.</note> This testimony wrought so much with
the President, as hee vsed him very kindly, and returned him home
with great contentment.</p>
               <p>Not long after the landing of the young Earle of Desmond in Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
the minds of the Provincials were much distracted, every one
fearing what might be the successe thereof. But after a little while it
appeared that he was able to doe but little. To the end that the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

here insert a Letter unto <hi>Tyrone</hi> from <hi>Cormocke Mac Dermond,</hi> the
Lord of the large Countrey of Muskry, who was never personally
in actuall Rebellion, neither afore, nor after the Spaniards arrivall;
the copie of which Letter came not to the Presidents hands, untill
the latter end of the yeere one thousand sixe hundred and two, and
he then pardoned, wherein it doth evidently appeare, what cancred
hearts the better sort of Subjects, did beare to the Crowne of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,

               <p>The President, to hold <hi>Redmond</hi> (as I conceiue) in some hope,
that hee might not joyne with the Northerne Forces (then expected
to come into Mounster,) returned him answer to this effect, That
his Demaunds seemed to bee somewhat reasonable, and that hee
was very sorry, that it was not fully in his power to accomplish his
request; Notwithstanding there was no doubt, but upon his Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
already dispatched to the Councell of England, and to the Lord
Deputie in his behalfe, such order should bee taken, as hee should
hold himselfe well satisfied; and surely whether the President dealt

bee inticed to commit any outrage within that Province: An o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
cause why these Rebels thus assembled came no further up into
Mounster, was, because the wandring Earle <hi>Iames fits Thomas,</hi> who
should haue given them Bonnaght in the Province, knowing that
<hi>Lixnaw, Redmond Burke, Pierce Lacie,</hi> and all of them were growen
wearie of the Rebellion, and that the President had commerce

and loose people dispersed in sundry corners, for whom no

the good Subjects, being the reliques of the rebellion.</p>
               <p>The President by his Letters dated the fifteenth signified unto the
Lords of the Councell,<note place="margin">In what good estate the province of Mounster was.</note> that now the Province was so much over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>awed
by her Majesties Forces, that unlesse Northern Rebels came to
infest it, or that the Spaniards did invade it, he was well able to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
the Provincials in obedience;<note place="margin">15. Decemb.</note> and although fiue hundred of his
List was already cashier'd, he would at any time lend the Lo. Deputie
one thousand Foot to serue in Linster, but with this caution (for
countenance sake) that they might bee evermore (in estimation) of
the List of Mounster; which if the Reader doe well obserue, he shall
finde that the prosecution of the service in that Province, had succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
beyond expectation: for in <hi>May</hi> last, when the President first
tooke the field, the Rebels were no lesse then seven thousand strong,
and now the Subjects Cattle day and night lay abroad in the fields,
no Bodie of Rebels united, and not one castle in all the province that
did withstand her Majestie: This was the vvorke of God, and unto
him onely it must be attributed.</p>
               <p>Her Majestie (as hath been said) did by her Letters to the President
command, that one Companie of one hundred Foot should bee ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shier'd
for the sustentation of the young Earle of Desmond, and of
others vvhich vvere mentioned in that Letter: The Lords of the
Councell likewise by their Letters bearing date the tenth of Novem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
required the President to see the same performed; which being
done accordingly (as was directed) the President by his Letters of the
twentieth of this December,<note place="margin">20. Decemb.</note> made an account how the partition
was made; Now you must understand, that although one hundred
Foot was discharged for the maintenance of the Earle, and the rest,
yet her Majesties meaning was not that more should bee turned to
that use, then the ready money which was payed to the Companie
yearely for their Lendings, for their apparell was saved unto her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jestie,
the yearely lendings of one hundred men amounts unto no
more then seven hundred eightie two pound, two shillings, and ten
pence. The Archbishop of Cassell, who was a principall Agent in

the Lady <hi>Ellis,</hi> sister to the Earle, had thirtie three pound, sixe

the remainder, which was fiue hundred fortie pound, twelue shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings

               <p>Whilest the President was holding Sessions at Limericke (as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore)

(suspecting her errand to haue been no other, but to see <hi>Iames</hi> the
young Earle) seemed to take no knowledge thereof, to make triall
whether the said Earle would acquaint him with such Letters, or
Messages, as should bee brought from his mother: At the end of
three dayes, the Earle related to the President, that such a woman
was in Towne, whom he had seene that morning, and not before.
The President answered, That her repayre to the Towne was
knowen to him certaine dayes before, but desired to bee certified
from him concerning the occasion of her comming; who replied,
that her errand was to his Sisters, the Lady <hi>Ioane,</hi> and the Lady <hi>El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len,</hi>

and conformitie (as you haue heard) the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sident
and Councell returned unto Moyallo the thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth
of December, where they had some leasure to
looke in the Corporate Townes, whom they found to
be principall ayders, abettors, and upholders of this unnaturall Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion,
which proceeded partly out of malice to the State for mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of Religion, but principally for their owne benefit; for in these
turbulent times, the greatest part of the Queenes Treasure sent over
into this Kingdome, is expended by the Captaines and Souldiers a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
them: Againe, they issue their Marchandise to the Rebells
(underhand) at very excessiue rates, and buy the Countrey Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities
at their owne prizes; by reason whereof it was probably
conjectured upon good grounds, that the Townes of Mounster were
more inritched within these three yeares of Warre, then they were
before almost in twentie yeares of peace. Another thing also at this
time was noted in the Townes, namely, that all the chiefe Cities
made choyse of professed Lawyers to be their Ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and chiefe Officers, and such as before were Ring leaders of their
Corporations. These prepensed Elections, whether they vvere
made for feare, left they should bee called to account for their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
faults, both in assisting the Rebells, and resisting the Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
or to maintaine the Townes in obstinate superstition, which
before was much a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>gmented by these Instruments, or for some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
hidden cause, knowen onely to themselues, I cannot certainely
determine, but sure I am it proceedeth not from any loyall or duti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
disposition. Amongst these lawlesse Lawyers thus elected, there
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:18000:80"/>
was one <hi>Geoffrey Gallway,</hi> Major of Limerick, a man that had spent
many yeares in England, in studying of the Common Lawes, and
returning into Ireland about three yeares since, did so pervert that
Citie by his malicious counsell, and perjurious example, that hee
withdrew the Major, Aldermen, and generally the whole Citie
from comming to the Church, which before they sometimes fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quented.
Moreover, about a yeare since there happened an affray in
Limricke, betweene the Souldiers and some of the Towne, at what
time this <hi>Gallway</hi> came to the then Major, advising him to dis-arme
all the Souldiers, and told him, that all their liues were in the Majors
hands, and at his mercy, whereby a gapp was most apparantly o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
by him, to haue induced a wicked and barbarous massacre
upon her Majesties Forces. With this man therefore did the Presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
take occasion to enter into the Lists, upon a manifest contempt
offered unto his Office and Government, as followeth: It came to
passe, that a Souldier of the Earle of Thomonds Company, was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisoned
by the said Major, for a supposed Pettie Larceny of a
Hatchet. The President (being upon his journey against the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bells,
that were now reported to haue invaded the Province) requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to haue the said Souldier delivered unto him, that hee might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
a present tryall, and punishment for his default, if hee were
found guiltie, or else to repayre to his Colours, and to goe the
journey. The Major before hee would deliver the Prisoner, desired
that hee might conferre with his Brethren; This being graunted,
hee returned answer, that it was not thought fit by the Corpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to release the prisoner, except his Lordshipp would make a
Warrant, enjoyning and commaunding them so to doe. The Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sident
and Councell being assembled, a Warrant was framed, signed,
and directed to the Major: but this Warrant was deemed unsuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient,
and therefore desired to haue the same amended in certaine
particulars, which without difficultie was yeelded unto, and a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
and a third framed according to the Majors owne directions;
and thus did hee dally untill hee saw the President ready to leaue the
Towne, some part of the Armie being already upon their March,
at which time the Major came to the President, and utterly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
all those Warrants, affirming that the Authoritie given them
by the Charter, did sufficiently exempt them from the Iurisdiction
and Commaund of the President and Councell: The President
much scorning to bee thus deluded and dallyed withall, told the
Major, that hee would shortly find a time to call him to an account
for his contempt offered, not against his Person, but against her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jestie
and her Government established in the Province: Who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
now returned from the Service, (as you haue heard) and abiding
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:18000:80"/>
at Moyallo, directed his Warrant to the said <hi>Gallway,</hi> commaunding
him upon his Alleageance, that hee should immediately appeare
before him and the Councell at a day assigned at Moyallo, to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
unto such things as should bee objected against him on her
Majesties behalfe; where making his appearance, hee was censured
to liue as a prisoner in a Castle in the Countrey,<note place="margin">The Major of Limerick fined and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisoned, and a new Major elected.</note> and not to come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Citie of Limricke, untill hee had payed a fine to her Majestie
of foure hundred pound sterling, which was designed for the repa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of Her Majesties Castle there; which summe was imployed
afterward to that use; and lastly, that a new Major should be placed
in his roome. The Townsemen presently sent an Agent (as their
manner is) to make suite unto the Councell of England, seeking to
abuse their Lordships with counterfeit humility and false suggesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
to get abatement either in whole or in part of this fine afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said;
but therein they failed of their expectation, and having recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
a check for their proud contumacie against the President, they
were commanded from the Court.</p>

               <p>The Province of Mounster standing now in these good tearmes
of Obedience and Conformitie (as you haue heard) the President
thought good for the diminution of Her Majesties charge to spare
some part of those Forces, which at first were allotted unto him for
this service; and therefore besides those fiue hundred which were of
late cashiered by direction from the Lord Deputie; he was conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to spare one thousand more to bee disposed for the warres of
Linster, or other places neere adjoyning, conditionally that they
might remaine upon the List of Mounster, aswell to countenance
his proceedings, as also that he might call them backe upon any occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
if new broyles should bee raised; and so in effect reduced the
Armie of that Province to fifteene hundred Foote and two hundred
Horse.</p>
               <p>You heare before, that the Earle of Ormond upon conference
with the President, undertooke to driue <hi>Redmond Burke,</hi> and the
other Rebels his associats out of his libertie of Ormond, within the
liberty of Tipperary, which although he oftentimes assaied to effect,
yet it sorted not to his desired end, untill the beginning of this
Moneth of Ianuary,<note place="margin">Ianuary.</note> at which time he employed the Lord of Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boyne,
Sir <hi>Walter Butler</hi> his Nephew, and Captaine <hi>Marberry,</hi> with
such forces as he had (of Her Majesties and the Countrey) to so good
purpose, that besides fourty fighting men that were presently slaine,
and amongst them <hi>Thomas Burke,</hi> brother to the said <hi>Redmond,</hi> and
the Armes of thirtie more gotten, they forced <hi>Redmond</hi> and all his
Company into the river of Nore, being at that time very high, and
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:18000:81"/>
there drowned seventie of his men with their armes, besides divers
Churles and all their baggage; certaine persons were also taken in
this service, amongst whom was <hi>Iohn Burke,</hi> brother to the said
<hi>Redmond,</hi> who was shortly after executed in Kilkenny, and <hi>William
Burke</hi> an other of his brethren, grievously wounded. But to returne
to the Presidents actions, who desirous that the Countrey might
grow acquainted with the civill governement, whereunto of late
it had beene a stranger, thought it convenient, that the Sherifes being
necessary officers for the State, should looke into the Countrey, as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well
to finde out such ill disposed Malefactors, and idle Vagabonds,
as were pernitious to the government, as also to levie at reasonable
rates, such provisions as the Countrey yeeldeth, and the Garisons
wanted: for this cause <hi>Iohn Barry,</hi> the Sheriffe of the County of
Corke, made a Iourney unto some of <hi>Florence Mac Cartie</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Sheriffs men slaine by Flor. Mac Gartie.</note> his lands,
who no sooner entered into his Countrie (as hee termed it) but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
he was resisted; and before he could make his retreate, some
of his men were murthered; the like measure was also offered to
some of the Garison of Kerry, who had no sooner set foote beyond
the Mang, a River that parteth Kerry and Desmond; but they were
instantly assaulted by <hi>Florence</hi> his Followers, and two of his souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
slaine.</p>
               <p>The President receiving Advertisement of these malicious and
traytourly practises of <hi>Florence</hi> (still continued) was exceeding de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirous
(according unto directions sent him out of England) to get
him into his hands, if it might bee effected, without putting the

could not as yet conveniently be performed: For <hi>Florence</hi>

                  </gap>everall breaches of his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
protection, wrote divers Letters unto the President, in excuse
of these facts, the same being stuffed (as his phrase was) with dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
oathes, and execrable blasphemies, that himselfe was never
acquainted with the former slaughters, and that his people were
strangely overseene therein, who mistaking the Souldiers for the
Sheriffes men, and the Sheriffes men for Traytors, committed those
offences at unawares. Answere was remissed by the President, that
the State was well perswaded of his loyaltie and innocencie, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
these disorders, and therefore requested him very earnestly to
make his repaire unto him, that hee might by his presence and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
the better finde out and punish those malefactors; but by no
meanes or wayes could he be drawen foorth of his strong Countrey
of Desmond, before hee had gotten his protection to be renewed; a
plaine demonstration of his guiltie conscience.</p>
               <p>Not long after, upon his repaire to the President, he mooved him

these suggestions to be untrue, which some of his Enemies had buz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
into the eares of the Councell of England, That hee was a
vowed enemy to the English Government, and a devoted friend
in his heart to the Spanish King. Secondly, that by his owne pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
(with the Councell) he might get that Countrey of Desmond
confirmed unto him, which hee now held rather by courtesie then
by right. And lastly, that the Queenes Majestie might understand
(out of his mouth) the present estate of that Province, to whose re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
(as he verily thought) shee would giue attentiue eare and cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit:
All this was urged, to the end, that the Province might be rid
of so dangerous a member, who vvas most likely to breed nevv
commotions: This Gentleman smelling the Presidents drift, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
himselfe to bee most willing,<note place="margin">Florence seemeth to like of the motion, but meaneth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing lesse, and the use he made of it.</note> and for that purpose would
returne into Desmond, and when his necessaries were provided
hee would speedily proceed in his Iourney for England. Within
certaine dayes after, he sent Messengers to the President, signifying
unto him, that the Countrey of Desmond was so poore and begger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
as it could not possibly affoord him meanes for such necessaries
as hee needed for his Iourney, and therefore requested his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships
Letters unto the chiefe Gentlemen of Carbery, that they would
bee contributors unto him in a businesse that did so neerely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne
him: All this being graunted and effected, hee neither went
forward, nor did he purpose at all to goe, as the sequell of his doings

                     <p>IT may please your Lordship, I am so infinitly distracted betweene
the earnest desire I haue to satisfie your Lordships commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and the present dangers which I see hangs over this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince;
if I should obserue them, as that I stand amazed, what Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell
to take, being in my selfe wholly addicted to obedience, and by
necessitie (in a manner) enforced to pause upon the same, untill I
may receiue your Lordships answer to these, and then without far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
protraction I will bee ready accordingly to obserue your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements;
wherein I humbly pray your Lordship deliberatly to
advise, being (as I take it) especially materiall for the furtherance of
Her Majesties service. The next day after, I received your Lordships
Letter of the seven and twentieth of Ianuary (being the thirtieth of
the same) for the better expediting of your directions, I addressed seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
warrants unto the Captaines residing neerest unto me, comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
every of them, to meete at the Townes of Clonmell and Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therd,
by the sixth of this Moneth, there to receiue such further di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections,
as the Lord <hi>Awdley</hi> (who I haue appointed to command
them) should direct. The List consists of one thousand and fiftie
Foote, and Sir <hi>Richard Greames</hi> Horse, Sir <hi>Garret Harvie,</hi> lyes so farre
remote in Kerry, as I could not conveniently in so short a time,
draw them to the rest: Wherefore, for that particular I humbly pray
to be excused: and for Sir <hi>Iohn Barklies</hi> Company (who are part of
the List aboue-said) I haue directed them by warrant according to
your Lordships former pleasure signified unto me, before the receipt
of your Lordships last letters to repaire into Connaght, but haue
now countermanded them, and doe hope they are not yet past. Thus
your Lordship may see my willingnesse to obey your directions,
which I did as gladly and affectionatly as your Lordship can desire.
But since having this day received these inclosed Letters from the
Earle of Thomond and Master <hi>Comerford;</hi> I doe make humbly
bold to present the consideration of them unto your Lordships wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
before I doe throughly accomplish your Commandements,
wherein my hope is, that your Lordship will both giue me thankes,

me unto it. In my judgement I am perswaded that this intelligence
is true, drawne thereunto by many and sundry the like advertise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
from all parts and persons, lately reconciled, whereof I could
send your Lordship bundels of papers of divers mens relations, and
now confirmed in the same by these inclosed Letters, which as your
Lordship sees, threatens the present disturbance of this Province, not
yet well setled. Yet neverthelesse, that it may appeare unto your
Lordship, that I am not backward to accomplish any thing, which
your Lordship shall require: I do yet continue (though not without
some hazard to this Province if these Northern Forces should pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
invade us) to send the Companies (aforesaid) to the Rendevous
before mentioned, with directions to remaine there until your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
shall returne me your pleasure in answer of these, and then what
you shall prescribe unto me, I will dutifully and carefully effect, assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
my selfe that your Lordship will haue such a speciall regard to
the State of this Province, as that you will not withdraw them, but
upon certaine knowledge of the untruth of these intelligence. But
(as a Councellor to speake my opinion) if your Lordship can other
wayes follow the prosecution in Lin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

from hence, it were very expedient to forbeare the same, untill this
Cloud be overpast, which cannot long hold in suspence; for all the
danger is betweene this and the end of the next Moneth, after which
time untill the Cattle be strong, and giue milke, there is little doubt:

from the Lords in England, saying, That they were exceeding
glad, to see that in so short a time hee had reduced the Province to
such tearmes, as that he could indure the cashiering of fiue hundred
Foot, and spare the Lord Deputie one thousand more of his List,
which was an evident demonstration of his Labours well spent in
the Service; and that his holding of Assises and Sessions, so long
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:18000:85"/>
dis-used, was a manifest signe of a new life in the Province; That
they had written to the Lord Deputie, to call <hi>Theobald ne Long Burke</hi>
in question for the murdering of <hi>Dermond O Conner,</hi> and had requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
him to see it punished; That notwithstanding her Majesties
pleasure was signified unto him, that <hi>Iames fits Thomas,</hi> his Brother
<hi>Iohn,</hi> the Baron of <hi>Lixnaw,</hi> the Knight of the Valley, and <hi>Pierce La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie,</hi>
should not be received to mercie upon any condition, but to be
left (as children of perdition) unto destruction, yet considering how
long Rebells may continue (by underhand friendships) in Ireland,
shee was pleased, that the Lord President should haue power (if he
saw cause to induce him thereunto) to accept of the last three, but
with this caution, That they should be pardoned for life onely, and
that not untill they had performed some signall services which might
merit such gracious favour. Lastly, they admonished the President
to carrie a strict hand upon the Commissaries of the Musters; for
by Certificate from Dublin, they understood that they were very
slacke in their duties.</p>
                     <p>The President knowing that it was a matter of no lesse moment,
to retaine and keepe the Provincialls in subjection and good order,
then it was at first to reduce them hereunto, imployed now a great
part of his time, in devising such courses as might secure them from
a future revolt, and therefore first resumed into his owne hands all
power of protecting, and then protested never to renew any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tections
(already granted) whereby they were constrained to use all
celerity and haste for the obtaining their Pardons. In so much, that
within lesse then two Moneths, (namely before the end of Februa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry)
the President had recommended aboue foure thousand by name
unto the Lord Deputie for Pardons, who had all put in such pledges
or other Caution, as by the State of the Province, was thought con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient,
which indeed was such and so warily taken, as no Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
in former times had ever done the like: All which notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
the President could not satisfie himselfe in the safetie of
the one, and so consequently in the securitie of the other, so long as
their pledges were remayning in the Cities of Corke, and Limerick,
the places of their custodie not being of sufficient strength, the Kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
many times negligent or corrupt in their charge<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the Citizens
so partiall, as they had rather helpe to convey them into the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
then to retaine them within the Citie:<note place="margin">An abstract of the Lord Presidents Letter to the Lords of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell.</note> for prevention where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
the President became an humble Suitor to the Lords of the
Councell of England, that they would be pleased to giue comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement,
that the Pledges of greatest moment might (by an order
from them) bee commanded to the Castle of Dublin, which should
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:18000:86"/>
not be any thing chargeable to Her Majestie, and yet very profitable
for the State: As also that they would be pleased to giue Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement
to all such Vndertakers, as hold land within the Province,
that they should make their immediate repaire unto their Signiories,
that thereby the Countrey might bee the better furnished with Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
upon any occasion: As also that Her Majestie might from them
receiue their rents in some part, of that immeasurable treasure which
was expended in these Warres.</p>
                     <p>And lastly being fully assured of a Spanish Invasion, in all his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patches
for England: He evermore put the Lords in mind of it, sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
unto them the intelligences hee had, and for that he would not
be taken unprovided, hee continually in all his Letters besought sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies
of Victuals, and Munition. And for that in his last dispatch, he
had intreated a large proportion of Victuals; now in this of the
sixth of March<note place="margin">6. March.</note> hee forbare the same, requesting onely fiue Laste of
powder, and foure hundred quarters of Oates.</p>
                     <p>The young Earle of Desmond, having beene tenderly brought up
in England, and not well agreeing with the manner and customes
of Ireland, and also seeing how much he was deceived in his hopes,
supposing that al his Fathers Followers would haue relied upon him,
and obeyed his directions; whereof finding little or no appearance,
desired the Lord President to giue him leaue to goe into England,
whereunto (for the reasons afore mentioned) the President easily as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented;
for in all the time of his being in Ireland, no one Rebell did
for his sake submit himselfe to Her Majestie, <hi>Thomas Oge</hi> of Kerry
onely excepted, who at his request submitted himselfe and rendered
Castle-mange (whereof he was Constable) by <hi>Iames fits Thomas</hi> his
assignement into Her Majesties hands, as formerly hath beene de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared.
But it may be truely supposed, that wit and necessitie did per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
him to submit, and render the Castle as he did; for Sir <hi>Charles
Wilmot</hi> had so blockt him up with Garisons, as at that present he was
in feare of starving; and if he had not taken the opportunity offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
upon the Earles motion, he was in danger to haue lost both his
life and it. This I write not to upbraid the Earle, or to lessen him in
any thing; for I must confesse, he was too good to liue amongst such
traitorly Followers, and no man living had a more willing desire to
serue Her Majestie then himselfe; but the truth is, that this was all
the service which hee did or could doe during his aboad in Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,
from whence he embarqued the two and twentieth of March,<note place="margin">22. March.</note>
and landed at Miniade in Somerset-shire, and so to the Court of
England; where after a few Moneths he died. The Letters Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents
which Her Majestie had granted for his restoration, the Presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
never delivered unto him, where in my opinion he did discreet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:18000:86"/>
and according to his directions, for they were sent unto him by
Her Majestie (with caution) not to deliver them, except he saw suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
cause so to doe, and that his services (or services done for his
fake) should merit the same; of both which there was but weake
and slender performance.</p>
                     <p>In this first Booke the Reader may behold in what a confused e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state
the Province of Mounster was in, when the L. President entred
into his government; in the first yeare whereof these memorable ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents
hapned: the unfortunate death of Sir <hi>Warham S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Ledger,</hi> the

of Castle Mange; the murdring of <hi>Dermond O Conner;</hi> the burning
and spoyling of East Clanwilliam, and Arlogh; the quiet setling of
the Province, and the restoring the civill government: Whosoever
with indifferencie will consider, how much was done in such short
time, must acknowledge it to bee beyond expectation, and say that
God fought for vs, and directed our Counsels, otherwise it was not
to bee hoped for: And had not the comming of the Spaniards,
given new interruptions, the worke of Mounster had
beene throughly finished: The Province fully
reduced to a setled peace, and in
all likelihood so to haue
continued.</p>

there was a tall Merchant (lately come with provent apparell for the

of the Queenes mercie, which is farre more infinite then your trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression
hitherto hath been; Of which Royall disposition of hers,
the examples (of the offenders in this Kingdome) are plentifull and
apparant. The pretence you make in your continuance in action,
is the wrongs done unto you, by your Vnckle, and to enable him far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to suppresse you utterly; you adde heere to that Arch-Traytor
<hi>Tyrone,</hi> and forsake your duetie to your Soveraigne, refusing her

excuse your errour, but beleeue mee, you shall neither bee Barron
of Letrim, or possesse your Fathers Inheritance by the ayde of that
perfidious Traytour, which I know hath not the power any long
time to support this Rebellion; and if he had, yet your selfe and all
the English race of Ireland birth, is as odious unto him, as now we
are, that are naturall English: If his power were able to make him
Monarch of Ireland, the <hi>Burkes,</hi> with all of English descent, must
looke for no other then assured extirpation: I am sure you are of

spare Mounster, and keepe others from harming the Province: If I
were but an ordinary Subject, and not an Officer to the Queene, I
neither might, or would make any such contract with you, and
therefore much lesse may I hearken to any such motion, being an

(as his Lordship advertised the President) that <hi>Hugh Boy,</hi> (who
was a man of good estimation, and very in ward with <hi>O Don<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell</hi>)
assured him, that the Spaniards would this yeare invade Ireland
with sixe thousand men, and would land in some part of Mounster,
and that three of the chiefe Townes (which must bee Corke, Lime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick

which moved the President, to grant his request, was the absence of

we must leaue the President in Cork, &amp; returne to <hi>Florence Mac Carty.</hi>

               <p>You heard before that <hi>Florence</hi> had a cutting (as they call it) upon
Carberry, towards his charges in the pretended journey for England,
but employed all the same, and whatsoever more hee could procure,

the same time, hee did earnestly sollicit aide from the neighbour

wrote a Letter in Irish (which was read by <hi>Iames Welsh,</hi> by whose

knew for: Wee haue also given order for Oates to be presently sent
you; and because you haue so good use of a Ship for transporting of
Victualls to and fro, besides the service shee may doe, in mastering
those Barques and Boats which offend the Coast, wee haue sent
Captaine <hi>Harvie</hi> with a good Ship for that purpose. And now
that you may know, what Letters wee haue intercepted out of
Spaine, concerning those bruits which wee perceiue are spread of
Spanish succours, you shall receiue the Copies of three Letters,
whereof wee haue the Originall, which were committed to the
charge of <hi>Peter Strong</hi> of Watterford, whose Ship and Goods were
taken in Famouth, where they were put in by storme; One of
them comes from the Governour of the Groyne, and another from a
Fryer that resideth with him, the third from one <hi>Sennock,</hi> who as it
seemeth, being unwilling to haue <hi>Tyrone</hi> deceived, sheweth him
truely how little reason they haue to trust to any of the Spanish Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours
as they expect; of these you may make such use as you thinke
good. As concerning your desire, to know what shall become of
the Lady <hi>Ioane</hi> of <hi>Desmond,</hi> wee thinke you should doe well to set
her at libertie againe as shee was before, referring the care of her
well doing to some of her Sisters, that may haue an eye over her.
We doe also require you still to foresee, that her Majesties Forces be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
now so much diminished, may not bee spent in maintaining
private mens Castles and houses, but where those places are of use
for her Majesties service. Lastly, concerning the Fine imposed on
the Major of Limrick, for which we finde you had so just occasion,
wee wish you in no wise to remit it, but rather to bestow it upon
the repaire of her Majesties Castle there, which as it seemeth, will
serue to so good purpose for her Ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

to harbour this Arch-rebell, or else upon occasion of some stealth that
had beene made in his Countrey, the thieues making towards this
Fastnesse, his Souldiers pursued them into this Wood, where by good
fortune, this supposed Earle with two of the <hi>Baldones</hi> and this <hi>Der<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi>
were gathered together, being almost ready to goe to supper;
but having discovered these Souldiers, they left their meate, and
made haste to shift for themselues; they were no sooner gone out of
the Cabbin, but the Souldiers were come in, and finding this provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
and a Mantle (which they knew belonged to <hi>Iames fits Thomas</hi>)
they followed the chase of the Stag now roused. By this time the
Harper had convaied the Sugan Earle into the thickest part of the
Fastnesse, and himselfe with his two other Companions, of purpose
discovered themselues to the Souldiers, and left the Wood with the
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:18000:93"/>
Lapwings policie; that they being busied in pursuite of them, the
other might remaine secure within that Fastnesse, and so indeed it
fell out; for the Souldiers supposing that <hi>Iames fits Thomas</hi> had beene
of that Company, made after them till Evening, by what time they
had recovered the White Knights Countrey, where being past hope
of any farther service, they returned to Barry-court, and informed
the Lord <hi>Barry</hi> of all those accidents: On the next morning, the
Lord <hi>Barry</hi> glad of so good a cause of complaint against the White
Knight, whom hee hated, hasteth to the President, and relating unto
him all these particulars, signifieth what a narrow escape the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traytor
had made, and that if the White Knights people had assisted
his Souldiers, hee could not possibly haue escaped their hands: Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
the White Knight was presently sent for, who being called be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the President, was rebuked with sharpe words and bitter re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensions,
for the negligence of his Countrey in so important a
busines, and was menaced, that for so much as hee had undertaken
for his whole Countrey; therefore hee was answerable both with
life and lands, for any default by them made: The White Knight
receiving these threatnings to heart, humbly intreated the President
to suspend his judgement for a few dayes, vowing upon his soule,
that if the said <hi>Desmond</hi> were now in his Countrey (as was averted)
or should hereafter repaire thither, hee would giue the President a
good account of him aliue or dead, otherwise he was contented that
both his Lands and Goods should remaine at the Queenes mercy;
and with these protestations he departed: And presently repairing
to Sir <hi>George Thornton,</hi> hee recounted unto him the sharpe reproofes,
which from the President hee had received; Sir <hi>George</hi> finding him
thus well netled, tooke hold of the occasion, &amp; never left urging him
to performe the service, untill he had taken his corporall oath (upon
a booke) that he would employ all his endeavours to effect the same<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Assoone as he was returned to his house, he made the like moane un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
some of his faithfullest Followers, as hee had done to Sir <hi>George
Thornton,</hi> and to stirre up their minds to helpe him in the perill hee
stood; hee promised him, that could bring unto him word where
<hi>Iames fits Thomas</hi> was, he would giue him fiftie pound in money, the
inheritance of a Plough land, to him and his Heires for ever, with
many immunities and freedomes. One of his Followers, which
loved him dearely, compassionating the perplexity hee was in, but
would you indeed (said he) lay hands upon <hi>Iames fits Thomas,</hi> if you
knew where to find him? the Knight confirmed it with protestati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,

The White Knight called <hi>Iames fits Thomas</hi> requiring him to come
out, and render himselfe his Prisoner: But contrariwise hee presu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
upon the greatnes of his quality, comming to the Caues mouth
required <hi>Redmond <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>urke</hi> and the rest to lay hands upon the Knight,
(for both hee and they were his naturall Followers) but the vvheele
of his fortune being turned, vvith their swords drawen they entred
the Caue, and without resistance disarming him and his foster Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
they delivered them bound to the White Knight, who caried
him to his Castle of Kilvenny, and presently dispatched a Messenger
to Sir <hi>George Thornton,</hi> to pray him to send some of the Garison, of
Kilmallock to take the charge of him, which employment was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to the care of Captaine <hi>Francis Slingesby,</hi> who marching with
his Company to Kilvenny, had the Prisoner delivered unto him, and
from thence with as much expedition as might bee, the White
Knight, Sir <hi>George Thornton,</hi> and Captaine <hi>Slingesby</hi> brought them
unto the President, then residing at Shandon Castle adjoyning to
Corke. But how the White Knight performed his promise to his
Servant it may bee doubted, though he had one thousand pound gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
him from Her Majestie for the service.</p>
               <p>The President having thus gotten his long desired prey,<note place="margin">Iames fits Thomas kept Prisoner in the Lord Presidents house.</note> not adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turing
to haue him kept in the Towne, appointed him lodging and
a Keeper within Shandon Castle, where himselfe then remayned,
and there held him in Irons, untill he was sent into England, which
was yet deferred; for the President being informed by the Queenes
learned Councell, that if he should dye before his arraignement, the
Queene could not be interressed in his Lands, but by act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and also his Brother <hi>Iohn,</hi> was not debarred by the Law from
the title, which this Pretender holdeth to be good in the Earledome
of Desmond. When the White Knight had delivered his Prisoner,
<hi>Iames fits Thomas</hi> into Captaine <hi>Slingesbyes</hi> custody; he told him, now
the house is yours, take care and charge of him.</p>
               <p>And in conference with Captaine <hi>Slingesby,</hi> told him how much
it grieved him, that the Lord President should suspect him to bee a
Releever of <hi>Iames fits Thomas,</hi> contrary to his protestation of service
to Her Majestie and to him; and to make it the better appeare what
infinite prejudice hee had received by his meanes. For first at the
comming of <hi>Tyrone</hi> into Mounster, <hi>Iames fits Thomas</hi> having some
jealousie (and not without cause) that the White Knight would quit
the confederacie, and humbly seeke Her Majesties gratious favour,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:18000:94"/>
acquainted <hi>Tyrone</hi> with it, who thereupon apprehended him, and
willed him either to put in his Sonne <hi>Iohn</hi> as Pledge of his perseve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
or else hee must detaine him Prisoner: which the White
Knight being neither able nor willing to performe, committed him
to the custody of <hi>Redmond Burke,</hi> who caried him out of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
making him lackie it by his horse side on foote like a common
Horse-boy; and that in his absence his Countrey being thus distracted
for want of a Head, the Earle of Ormond came with some forces,
preying, burning, and spoyling most part of his Countrey; and that
he was forced to pay unto <hi>Redmond Burke</hi> two hundred pound ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
after three moneths imprisonment with this ill vsage, conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
that it might well be beleeved, hee had small cause to doe those
favours to <hi>Iames fits Thomas</hi> (which were suspected) considering hee
had received those harmes and losses from him, who was never able
to repayr him of the least part thereof. But it may well be conceived
that the White Knight had not (untill he was so pressed by the Presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent)
made any diligent inquity after him; and that if he had more
timely sought it, he might sooner haue effected it.</p>
               <p>Captaine <hi>Slingesby</hi> having now the Prisoner and the whole house
and keyes committed over to his charge and keeping, setting his
Guards and Sentinels both within the house and without, as was
fitting for the Guard of so welcome a Prisoner, went to where the
said <hi>Iames</hi> was to be his Watch that night, and judging a man in his
case not capable of any favour from Her Majestie (as being the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall
cause of all the rebellion of Mounster, though otherwise none
of the bloodiest enemies) could take no comfort, in discourse was
silent by him, not willing to grieue him with discoursing on that
which hee thought could not bee pleasing unto him, untill <hi>Iames fits
Thomas</hi> himselfe first ministred occasion, who having had some no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
what Captaine <hi>Slingesby</hi> was, after some complements, began in
fome sort to extenuate, though not to excuse his former faults to Her
Majestie, how he was inforced to take that title upon him, otherwise
his brother <hi>Iohn</hi> would not haue beene so nice in the accepting; and
that hee never shed any English blood in the first insurrection, nor
suffered any to doe it that hee could withhold (though many of his
Followers did not so piously obserue it) but with the best respect of
humanity, did cause them to be sent out of the Countrey to the next
coast Townes with the least offence that might be<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and therefore ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
Her Majestie, who had extended her clemencie to farre greater
crimes (though it was his hard fortune to bee so eminent a man in
that action) she would now retract nothing of Her wonted good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
and mercy: Intimating withall his Father to bee elder brother
to <hi>Gerrot,</hi> Earle of Desmond, who by the power of his Mother a
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:18000:94"/>
second wife was disinherited, and her sonne, though a younger re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
and acknowledged for Earle of Desmond. With these and
other discourses they spent the whole night untill it was day, when
they made ready to goe to Corke to the Lord President, to deliver
the Prisoner.</p>
               <p>Vpon these reasons,<note place="margin">Iames fits Thomas ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigned and condemned.</note> the Prisoner at a Sessions (holden in Corke for
that purpose) was indicted, arraigned, convicted, and adjudged, to
bee executed as a notorious Traytor; which being done, the Presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
advertised all the proceedings into England, and desired that he
might be sent to the Tower of London, and there to remaine in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son;
humbly praying that his life might bee spared, in policie of
State; for whilest hee lived, his brother <hi>Iohn</hi> could not make any
pretext to the Earledome; whereas to the contrary, he being dead, it
was very probable that the Rebels would set him up (for a new Idoll)
in his place, whereof what inconveniences might ensue was appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant.
These reasons although they are subject to every mans under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
that hath common sense; and therefore no marvell, that the

Sir George Carew, Lord President of Mounster, most
humbly beseeching your Honour to certifie Her Majesty, and the
Lords of her most Honourable Councell of the same:<note place="margin">A Relation presented to the Lord President by Iames fits Thomas and sent into England.</note> Hoping in
the Almighty, that Her Highnesse of her accustomed clemencie and

by his release. The third of Iune, 1601.</head>
                     <p>FIrst it may please your Honour to consider, that this action at the
beginning was never pretended, intended, nor drawen by me,
nor my consent; but by my Brother <hi>Iohn,</hi> and <hi>Pierce Lacy,</hi> having
the oathes and promises of divers Noblemen, and Gentlemen of this
Province, to maintaine the same, and not ever consented unto by mee,
untill Sir <hi>Thomas Norris</hi> left Kilmallock, and the Irish forces camped
at Rekeloe in Connologh, where they stayed fine or sixe dayes; the
most part of the Countrey combining and adjoyning with them,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:18000:95"/>
and undertooke to hold with my Brother <hi>Iohn,</hi> if I had not come to
them; the next Sessions (before these proceedings) at Corke, Sir
<hi>Thomas Norris</hi> arrested me (in person) therefore my Brother, he being
then suspected by him, and intended to keepe me in perpetuall pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
for him, untill I made my escape; by this the intent of Sir <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas
Norris</hi> being knowen, the feare and terrification thereof drew
me into this action; and had I beene assured of my libe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ty, and not
clapt up in prison for my Brothers offence, I had never entred into
this action: Further, I was bordered with most English neighbours,
of the Gentlemen of this Province, I defie any English that can
charge me with hindring of them, either in body or goods<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but as
many as ever came in my presence, I conveyed them away from time
to time.</p>
                     <p>Also it is to bee expected, that the Spanish Forces are to come into
Ireland this Summer, and <hi>Oneale</hi> will send up the strongest Army of
Northren men into Mounster, with my Brother <hi>Iohn,</hi> the Lord of
Lixnaw, and <hi>Pierce Lacy;</hi> and when they are footed in Mounster,
the most part of the Countrey will joyne with them: Preventing
this, and many other circumstances of service, the saving of my life,
is more beneficiall for Her Majestie then my death: For if it may
please Her Majestie to be gratious unto me, I will reclaime my Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
the Lord of Lixnaw, and <hi>Pierce Lacy,</hi> if it please Her Majesty
to bee gratious unto them, or else so diligently worke against them
with Her Majesties forces, and your directions, that they shall not be
able to make head, or stirre in Mounster at all; for by the saving of
my life, Her Highnesse will winne the hearts in generall of all her
Subjects, and people in Ireland, my owne service, and continuance
of my alliance in dutifull sort, all the dayes of their liues.</p>
                     <p>Farther, I most humbly beseech your Honour to foresee, that there
are three others, of my Sept and race aliue; the one is in England,
my Vncle <hi>Garrets</hi> Sonne, <hi>Iames,</hi> set at liberty by Her Majestie, and in
hope to obtaine Her Majesties favour, my Brother in Vlster, and my
Cosen <hi>Maurice fits Iohn</hi> in Spaine; wherewith it may be expected,
that either of these (if I were gone) by Her Majesties favour, might
be brought in credit, and restored to the House: It may therefore
please Her Majestie to bee gratious unto me, assuring to God and the
world, that I will bee true and faithfull to Her Majestie during life:
By which meanes Her Majesties government may bee the better set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led;
my selfe and all others my Alliance, for ever bound to pray for
Her Majesties life, long to continue.</p>
                     <p>But afterward being examined by the President, and the Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall

<hi>Andrew Roche,</hi> hath beene alwayes in the seruice of the
Queene of England, and hath performed her manifold ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices
at Sea: whereby he had great preferment and credit, and being
of late time conversant with Catholikes, and teachers of divine In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions,
that were sory for his lewd life, made knowen unto him
the danger wherein his soule was; so that by their godly perswasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
hee was at that time reclaimed, and subverted to bee a good Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike,
and to spend the residue of his life in the defence and service
of the Church; since which time of reconcilement, hee was to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire
to your Majestie with his Ship and Goods, as is well knowen
to your Highnesse Councell, who confiscated that Ship to your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties
use; himselfe being at that time strucken with extreame sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
that hee was not able to proceed in the voyage; and when his
Company returned into Ireland, they reported that the Lantado
wished rather his person then the Ship, which made him fearefull
ever since to repaire thither, till hee should deserue his freedome
by some worthy service to your Majestie.</p>
                     <p>The Heire apparant to the Crowne of England, had beene caried
by him to your Highnesse, but that he was bewrayed by some of his
owne men, and thereby was intercepted, and himselfe taken Priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
where he remained of long, till by the Providence of God, and
the helpe of good friends, hee was conveyed into Ireland to mee in a
small Boat; and leaving these occasions to your Imperiall Majesty,
and being assured of his trust, faith, and confidence towards mee,
haue committed this charge into his hands; the rather for that I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
your Royall Fleete is directed for England this yeare, to the
end he may be a Leader and Conductor to them in the Coast of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land
and Ireland, being very expert in the knowledge thereof, and in

               <p>Consider I beseech thee gentle Reader, into what proud arrogan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie,
and audacious insolency this Arch-traytor was elevated (like a
Vapor in a Sunshine day) when blind fortune laught upon him; the
Queene a Tyrant, the English all cowards, the Cities and walled
Townes all his, and the Mounster Nobilitie subdued under his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority;
was there ever Rebell so farre transported with ambitious
presumption, beyond the limits of reason? was it not sufficient for
him like cursed <hi>Shimei,</hi> or blacke mouthed railing <hi>Rabshakeh,</hi> to revile
the Lords annoynted, but he must challenge her territories, her Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
her People, and her Nobilitie (whom shee and her ancestors had
created) to be his owne, who had no portion nor inheritance in any
part thereof, being the Impe of a borne Bastard. But surely I must
perswade my selfe, all this was permitted by the unsearchable sapi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of the alseeing Deity, who even as hee caused proud <hi>Lucifer</hi>
to bee throne from the Chaire of highest Majestie, (whereunto hee
presumed) into the lowest Dungeon of darke obscurity, for ever to
bee tormented; so did hee suffer this aspiring <hi>Absolon,</hi> to magnifie
himselfe in the height of vaine glory, <hi>Vt lapsu graviore ruat,</hi> that being
throwen headlong downe from the Pinnacle of ambition, he might for ever bee poynted at as an exemplary mirror for all insolent Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors.</p>
               <p>Whilest hee remayned Prisoner in Shandon, the President thought
good to send for him oftentimes, before himselfe and the Councell,
and there to examine him upon such particulars, as they thought most
materiall for the advancement of the present service. And amongst
the rest, they questioned him concerning the originall causes and
principall motiues,<note place="margin">The causes of the rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion in Mounster as Iames fits Thomas alleaged.</note> that induced this late rebellion in Mounster; hee
answered that the foundation principally was religion, then the Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakers
encroaching upon Gentlemens lands, the feare of English
Iuries passing upon Irish mens liues, the taking notice of slight evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
upon such arraignements, the generall feare conceived of the
safetie of their liues, by the example of the execution of <hi>Redmond
fits Gerald</hi> and <hi>Donoghe Mac Craghe,</hi> and the great charge (which
was yeerely exacted) for Her Majestie out of every Plough-land
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:18000:98"/>
within the Province, called the composition rent; and because these
his pretences, doe not much vary from the allegations (<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>) by
<hi>Oliver Hussie,</hi> a Schoole-master, a most pernitious member in this
traiterous combination, I haue thought fit to interpose the same in
this place. This <hi>Hussie</hi> therefore examined upon the same Interro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatories,
answered as followeth.</p>
               <p>First the Countrey was (much against their wils) driven to pay
composition to the Queene,<note place="margin">Husseys re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of the causes of the rebellion in Mounster.</note> for three yeares upon certaine Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants:
These Covenants were not observed on Her Majesties part,
nor yet the composition ceased at the determination of the said
tearme: Wherefore they thought the Composition would not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
bee continued, but also augmented<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> from time to time, at the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of their Superiors, till they should bee weary of their Lands<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Many new and extraordinary wayes were sought out in conceale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
(and such like) to the great discomfort and feare of Landlord<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
and Freeholders.</p>
               <p>The extortions and unlawfull dealings of Sherifs, and other like
officers, to rob the Countrey-men of their goods; for they did use
to keepe many Courts (for gaine) and not for Iustice, they did use to
bring many Writs from Dublin, for very small causes, they did use to
buy old caveling titles, to receiue bribes, for not going to poore Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemens
houses, and other like inconveniences.</p>
               <p>The continuall vexation by Processes from the spirituall Court,
where by Fines and Bribes (to saue mens consciences) they were
greatly grieved, and specially by the High Commission.</p>
               <p>The manner of execution of <hi>Donog<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e Mac Craghe,</hi> and <hi>Redmond
fits Gerald,</hi> and seeking of <hi>Thomas fits Maurice</hi> his blood, did greatly
discomfort them, fearing that every of their liues were in like dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</p>
               <p>The severall examinations of these two (being both deepely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
in the action) <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> haue therefore inserted into this present relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
First that the world may bee satisfied, upon what weake pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>texts,
and imaginary supposed conjectures the Rebellion was groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded:
And therefore the former scandalous suggestions which Hell
had devised, and the Popes damned Legat had forged against Her
Majestie, were the more abominable. And secondly, that those
Officers that should succeed in governing this kingdome, might care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
shun and warily avoid all Bribery, Corruption, and Partiality,
that the exclayming mouths of these discontented people, may bee
either altogether shut, or else opening the same, they may spue out
nothing but their owne shame. But to proceed.</p>
               <p>About the beginning of this Moneth of Iune, the President recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
gratious Letters from Her sacred Majestie, wherein she acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging

                     <p>Wee greet you well:
Although We haue forborne when we inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to haue made knowen vnto you by some
expresse testimonie from Our selfe, Our ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation
of your Services, yet We haue given
particular charge to Our Councell, that they should in Our
Name make you perceiue our liking of your proceedings, in
such sort, as you might not conceiue that either the report of
them came not to our eares, or that you served a Prince not
willing to acknowledge the good merits of her Servants. But
now that cause is ministred vnto vs, to giue charge vnto you of
other matters specially concerning our service; We thought
it convenient to incourage you to that which followeth, by
thankes-giving for that which is past, and by assuring you
by our owne Letters, that as you haue not deceived our expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation
of your sufficiencie, or our trust reposed in your faith,
So will not wee be wanting on our part, to manifest how accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
these things are vnto vs, whensoever Wee finde them in
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:18000:99"/>
any one, whom Wee haue conferred trust in imployment. The
matter that now Wee thinke meet to acquaint you with, is, that
having found by long experience, that the vsing of sterling mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys
in the payment of our A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>mie there, and for our other Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices,
doeth bring marveilous inconveniences both to that
Realme, and to this; And that the wisedome of all our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genitors
(for the most part) did maintaine a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
the Coynes of both Realmes, (that in Ireland being e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
inferiour in goodnesse to that of this Realme) howsoever
by errour of late crept in, it hath beene otherwise tollerated to
the infinite losse of this Kingdome, Our Moneyes being out of
that Realme transported into forraine Countreyes, for lacke
of Marchandise. We haue thought it reason to reviue the
ancient course of our Progenitors in that matter of Moneyes,
and haue caused a Coine proper for that Our realme of Ireland,
to be stamped heere, of such a Standard as Wee finde to haue
beene in use for the same, and doe now send a great quantitie
thereof thither by Our Treasurer at Warres, to bee imployed
for the payment of Our armie, and for other vses, and the same
doe authorise by Our Proclamation, and decrie all other Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys.
In the establishing of which course, as we doubt not but
Our Deputie and Councell there, will as they are by Vs com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded,
proceed according to such directions as wee haue given
them: So because the Province (whereof you haue charge) is
a place of most Traffique of any other of that Kingdome,
and therefore in it, it is most likely that Marchants at the first
shew of such an Innovation, will for private respects <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of this our purpose, and to require you to use all your autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie
and your judgement likewise t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

from vs to our Deputie and Councell there, or betweene vs and
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:18000:99"/>
our Treasurer of Ireland concerning this matter, whereof wee
haue given order, that herewith Copies shall bee sent vnto you,
by which you will be sufficiently instructed of apparant reasons
to leade vs to doe it, although it be a matter which wee need
not make gracious with any reason at all, being meerely depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant
of our Prerogatiue, to alter the Standerd of our Moneys
at our pleasure. Wherefore, though wee nothing doubt of
your forwardnesse, to further whatsoever wee finde reason to
command: Yet we require you in this thing, as a matter which
wee would haue well founded in the first establishing, to giue
all attention of it, as well by your owne actions, as by assisting
Our Treasurer and his Deputies in the uttering of these newe
Moneyes, and bringing in all others according to the course
of Our Exchange, which by Our Proclamation you may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue

verified by certaine intelligences, which the Lord <hi>Barry</hi> received
from <hi>Dermond Mac Awley</hi> lately come from the North, the effect
whereof was thus much: When the Spanish Arch-bishop was to
returne into Spaine in February last, there was a Councell holden in

                  <note place="margin">The report which Der<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond Mac Awley made of the Councell held in Vl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster about the fittest place for the Spaniards landing in Ireland.</note> the said Bishop, and all the chiefe Traytors

                     </gap>rmond Mac Awley,</hi> being called thereupon; the
chiefest matter debated in this consultation was, what place of Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land
was the most convenient, where the Spanish forces should
make their arrivall. It was without much difficulty or gainesaying
resolved, for all respects Mounster was the fittest Province to be inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded;
then it remayned to consider what place in that Province they
should first attempt; and concerning this point the Mounster men
were required to deliver their opinions: <hi>Pierce Lacy</hi> began and ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
certaine reasons, why hee thought it most requisit for them first
to gaine Limerick, and plant there, because the Provinces of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naght
and Linster were neere at hand, to minister aide to the Spanish
Armie, and Vlster was not farre distant, being also the place most re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
from England, especially for shipping: All the rest being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
by these reasons to subscribe unto his opinion, <hi>Donoghe Mac
Cormock</hi> stood up, and withstood this Councell, saying that <hi>Mac Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
More</hi> (from whose mouth he said he spake it) upon mature delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,<note place="margin">Meaning Florence Mac Carty.</note>
did advise their comming to Corke; for the taking of that
place would bee of most importance, as well for the countenancing
of the action (where the President most resided) as the magazins of
victuals and munitions were placed there, and also it being a farre
better outlet then the River of Limerick, the Citie weaker and soo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
forced: And lastly in landing there, they should border upon
<hi>Barry, Roche, Cormock Mac Dermond,</hi> and <hi>Mac Carty Reughe;</hi> all
which for feare of their estates, were partially affected to the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish,
and by that meanes, either constraine them to conjoyne with
them in the action, or else to make their Countrey and people a prey
unto the Army. After long disputation the Councell of <hi>Florence</hi>
delivered by <hi>Donoghe Mac Cormock</hi> was most applauded, and so they
concluded to land the Spanish Armie in the River of Corke.</p>

                     <p>MY good Lord and Cosen, your Letters of the eighteenth of
May, I received the fiue and twentieth of the same, wherein
you relate the manner of your proceedings with the Presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
at Corke, and also of his determination towards the West of
my Countrey: I thanke God I prevented that which hee expected
here, for all the good pledges of the Countrey are committed to
Castlemange, for their constant behaviour in this our action; the
President with his force is come to Limerick, and intended present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to draw towards Askeiton, where I purpose with my Armie to
resist him, I pray you the better to further the service, and the more
to coole the bloody desire of our Enemy; let mee intreate you to put
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:18000:107"/>
in effect, the meaning of my last Letters, by drawing your forces to
joyne with mee here, which being done, I doubt not under God to
performe service, that shall redound to the generall quiet of our
Countrey, and so referring the due consideration hereof (to your
Lordships carefull vsage) I commit you to the most Mighty:</p>

Master <hi>Ienkin Conway,</hi> an Vndertaker, to bee burned, fearing lest Sir
<hi>Charles Wilmot</hi> should plant himselfe there; and when as the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
afterward placed this Examinat therein, hee sent some of his
kerne and tooke all his prey, threatning to pull them all out by the
heeles, having no other quarrell against him, but onely because hee
repaired the same Castle: Hee also releeved the Knight of the Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley
at his house of the Pallace: And after (the said <hi>Florence</hi> was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected
by the President) hee releeved likewise <hi>Thomas fits Maurice</hi> the
Barron of Lixnaw, and ceassed his Bonoghs in Desmond; but more
plainely by examination of <hi>Iames Welsh</hi> taken the tenth of May,
1601. as followeth.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Iames fits Thomas</hi> was in Kerry in September last, <hi>Florence
Mac Cartie</hi> perswaded him to remaine there,<note place="margin">The exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of Iames Welsh.</note> promising him all the

hee would bring him to the killing of Sir <hi>Charles Wilmot,</hi> and the
Garison of Traley that was with him, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>And when hee saw that <hi>Iames fits Thomas</hi> would not follow his
Councell, but would needs goe to take Arlogh Mountaines for his
refuge; hee wrote a Letter in Irish (which the said <hi>Iames Welsh</hi>
read) directed unto <hi>Cahir Mac Shane Glasse Omulrian</hi> in Ormond,
desiring him to levie for him in those parts sixe hundred Foote,
which if hee could not doe, then to procure <hi>Redmond Burke</hi> to get
so many for him; and if hee failed, then to deale with Captaine
<hi>Tirrell,</hi> and that hee would pay them upon Desmond. About this

Also after that <hi>Dermond O Conner</hi> had enterprised the taking of <hi>Iames

Rebellion, and to that end he solicited <hi>Dermond Mac Owen, Mac Aw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley,

<hi>Tyrone</hi> was in Mounster, <hi>Florence</hi> desired him to make it knowen to
the King of Spaine, that hee would serue him faithfully; for the
assurance whereof, the said <hi>Florence</hi> wrote a Letter to the King, and
gaue it to <hi>Tyrone</hi> to bee sent into Spaine: And also tooke his corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
oath to performe his promises; whereupon <hi>Tyrone</hi> stiled and
confirmed him <hi>Mac Carty More;</hi> hee also told the said <hi>Thomas Oge,</hi>
that if the Spaniards did not land by May next, hee would goe into
the North, and from thence into Spaine. And after that <hi>Iames fits
Thomas</hi> was broken, hee told this examinat, that if <hi>Iames</hi> could get
Forces out of Vlster, the said <hi>Florence</hi> would joyne with him. Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<hi>Florence</hi> intised <hi>Connocke Mac Dermond</hi> to enter into rebellion,

sent to <hi>Owen Mac Teg Mergagh</hi> in Desmond to carry his said Sonne to
Corke, there to bee left as a pledge for him; within a few dayes after
this message sent, <hi>Florence</hi> receiving advertisement from <hi>Tyrone,</hi> of

to the said <hi>Owen Mac Teg mergagh</hi> to make stay of his Sonne
for a longer time; <hi>viz.</hi> untill hee might perceiue what would bee
the issue of those preparations; but before the Messenger could
come, the said <hi>Owen</hi> was with the child upon his way, and come to
Corke, before the said Messenger overtooke him, but had not as yet

to your satisfaction; and be assured, that I will performe with his Maiestie,
the office that a Brother ought to doe, that he should send from Spaine. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause

that his Imprisonment was not for marrying of the Earle of <hi>Clan
Cares</hi> daughter without leaue, as was pretended, but upon suspition
which the State had of his loyaltie, which he understood by Letters
written from the Lord Deputie, and Treasurer of Ireland to
the Queene, (which was intercepted and brought into Spaine)
wherein it was suggested, that hee having so many kinsmen, friends,
and followers, and himselfe (who was knowne to beare affection
to Spanyards) it were fit hee were restrayned; and that this onely
was the cause of his eleven yeeres restraint. Wherefore hee advised
him, not to put any confidence in the English: for if they once
againe lay hold upon him, they would never enlarge him.</p>
               <p>Hee advised him to certifie his Majestie, how much hee was his
Servant, what Townes and places hee could put into his handes,
what number of men of warre hee could serue him withall; and
if he could surprize Corke, he should bee well supplyed by the King
of Spaine.</p>
               <p>That hee might send his Letters (written to the King) unto <hi>Don
Diego Brochero,</hi> (who is a great favourer of the Irish Nation, and in
great credit with the King) by which meanes they would bee safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
delivered, as also his Letters unto him, for the solicitation of his

from the Groyne, which hee could not doe unto <hi>Oneale,</hi> and <hi>O Don<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell,</hi>

unto him, hee would advise with <hi>Don Diego,</hi> and repaire himselfe
unto him into Ireland.</p>
               <p>Lastly, hee hoped that the King of Spaine would the next Spring
send an Armie into Ireland.</p>

resoundeth in the aire for a good space before it falleth, and the neerer
it approacheth, the more palpably and senseably is perceived; such
was this tempestuous storme of the Spaniards intended invasion,
which was now so vniuersally seconded from all places, that it was
generally expected both in England and Ireland; and for this cause
the President did earnestly sollicit the Councell of England that sixe

to bee sent presently for Waterford, and the rest to bee in a readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse

for the Spanyards to attempt, &amp; most necessary for her Majestie both
in pollicie and honour to defend: for to prevent their descent in
any place, (where themselues thought meete) was by him deemed
impossible. But it was to bee presumed, that they would attempt
such a place, as should bee honourable for them to gaine, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantagious
for her Majestie to loose; And therefore hee thought
that their discent (most likely) would be at Limerick, Waterford, or
Corke; as for the other Townes, they were neither worth their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
to winne, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nor her Majesties charges to defend: Limericke
was farre seated within the land, neither could they disimboge from
thence without an Easterly winde, (which beeing rare) it was not
likely that they would hazzard their Fleet upon such disadvantage:
Waterford (though weake and commodious for them) it was so
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:18000:115"/>
neere to England, and especially lying so conveniently for her Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties
Forces, within that Kingdome, the Deputie on the one side, and
the President on the other, being so neere at hand, as it was not like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
that they would land there: Corke therefore hee supposed to bee
most convenient for them to assaile, and most necessary for her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jestie
to defend for these reasons: First, because those that had beene
the greatest dealers about this Invasion in Spaine, namely one <hi>Der<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond
Mac Cartie,</hi> a neere kinsman to <hi>Florence,</hi> called by the Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards,
<hi>Don Dermutio,</hi> did advise (as aforesaid) <hi>Florence</hi> by Letters,
(which were intercepted) to surprise Corke; Secondly, the said <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence</hi>
did advise the Spanish Archbishop, by his Agent <hi>Donogh Mac
Cormock,</hi> (as you haue heard) that Corke was the fittest place for this
designe; Whereunto both <hi>Tyrone</hi> and all the Northerne Rebels did
subscribe. Lastly, her Majesties Magazines of Victualls, Munition,
and Treasure residing there in great quantities, could not without
infinite trouble, and great danger be remooved: for besides, if they
should be removed, either to Limrick or Waterford, neither of those
were altogether secure, yet it would give an apparant testimony of
feare, conceived of their comming, which would not onely amaze
the best affected subjects, through the Province, but give occasion to
the rest generally to revolt: upon these reasons the President thought
fit to assemble all the forces within the Province, (which was then
but 1300 Foote, and 200 Horse in List) unto Corke or the places
neere adjoyning, for the manning and making good of that Citie,
which in it selfe, by the naturall situation thereof, was very weake,
and of small defence.</p>
               <p>The Lords by his Lette<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

owne judgement, as occasion should be offered; saying farther, that
where by his own Letters they perceived, (whereunto al mens judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

against a powerfull enemy, they thought fit to give him this ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
rule, that in case he should see such forces arrive, applying them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to a place of weake defence, (which in his judgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t must in the

cause, and therefore he should not doe well to venture his small For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
where they, with Her Majesties provisions, were sure to be lost,
howsoever he might peradventure thinke to dispute it for some few

their Lordships, and maintaining the same (as by his Letters of the

and left him to his owne judgement; wherein it seemes hee did not
erre, for their intention of landing at Corke prooved true, (as here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after
shall appeare) whereof for farther testimony of the same, all
the Letters which were sent from Spaine to <hi>Don Ioan de Aquila,</hi> after
his landing in Ireland, were directed to Corke, which is an evident
argument, that Corke was their designe, and that in Spaine it was
conceived that <hi>Don Iuan</hi> was possessed of it,<note place="margin">A branch of the L. Presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents Letter to M. Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

he wrote to M. Secretarie <hi>Cecill</hi> upon the same subject, his very words
were as followeth. The resolution I held, I still hold, which is to
defend and keepe Corke, the reasons (in my Letters to the Lords) I
have at large discoursed, if Her Majestie shall relinquish any of her
walled Cities, (as I am advised to doe) all will be lost, and a generall
revolt will insue, wherfore it were better to put somwhat in hazard,
then apparantly to lose all: The towne I know to be infinite weake,
but many handes is a strong defence, and when the 2000 aides
shall come, the enemy shall find it a tough piece of worke <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>o gaine it:
To remoove the Queenes Magazines, of victualls, Munition,
and treasure, (as some doe advise) into the Countrey, I know no place
capable of it, nor yet is there any meanes of carriage (especially in this
Harvest time) to convey it away betweene this and Michaelmas, and
to send it by sea, must be either to Waterford or Limricke, (which as
farre as I know) may proue no lesse dangerous then at Corke, no
man certainely knowing where the Enemy will make his discent:
But if the worst should happen, that the Towne must bee los<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, the
treasure (at least) shall be saved, and the rest, the Enemy shall never
enjoy. The rasing of Shandon is to no purpose, for every Hill and
Ditch (neere the Towne) commands the Citie no lesse then it, the
defences of earth (which by my directions are in making) are onely
made to winne time; and I haue so provided, that the charge of the
workemen is borne by the Towne and Countrey, the Queenes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences

Whildebarrowes, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Now wee may see how true a Prophet the President was, that the
Spaniards would invade Ireland; but like unto <hi>Cassandra,</hi> untill this

(which both the Lords in England, and the Lord Deputie of Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land)

                     <p>SIr <hi>George Carew,</hi> on Wednesday last, certaine Pinnaces of her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties
met with a fleete of Spaniards, to the number of fiftie
saile, whereof seventeene are men of warre, the rest are transporting
Ships, as by this Note inclosed doth appeare, which my Intelligencer
sent me at their going out. These Ships cannot bee but for Ireland,
from which Coast the storme kept them, unlesse it should bee said,
that the King will land them in the Low-countries, which I will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
beleeue hee durst adventure, knowing how long wee haue ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
them; and haue fourteene good ships out, which if you com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
with the note inclosed of his, you shall find that wee might be
ashamed to suffer his Fleete to land so quietly, and our Fleete in the
taile of them; but (which is more certaine) to confirme my opinion
ever for Ireland, this proportion is fit for Ireland, there it may worke
mischiefe; and besides, that they which met them, saw them set their
course from the mouth of the sleeue (where they were on wednes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day)
just for Ireland, and (as I verily thinke) they will fall for Lime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick;
for in Spaine it was advertised me, that their Rendezvous was
for the Blaskys, which you know is on that Coast, about the Dingle
or the Ventrey: Lastly, if they
had meant to haue come hither, they would haue beene here before this time, being on wednesday at Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley,
and the wind having beene South-west since faire. If therefore
they bee not in Ireland, they are certainely put Roomer with Spaine
againe; but that I dare not hope. Now Sir, what my Lord Deputy
and you shall doe there, is not our parts to tell you, onely wee desire
you to propound us possible things, and then shall you haue them;
two thousand wee haue sent already into Mounster, at least the want
of wind hinders them, in the imbarquing Ports: if we know once
where they are landed, then must you also tell us, where you will
haue us second you: for if you looke for our supplyes to come
to you, in the West side of Mounster, or South parts, then can
we put them by Sea more properly, and land neerer the parts of
Accon, then to send them to Dublin, or to Corke, but all this to you
must bee referred, to whom I wish as great happinesse as I wish to
my owne heart: And so I end</p>

hee gaue unto Sir <hi>Francis,</hi> was that hee should not (up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
any direction) goe out of that Province, untill hee first heard
from him; the reason which moved him to insert this clause into his
instructions, was the confident assurance hee had of the Spanish in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vasion:
But yet to prevent the worst, left the Lord Deputie might
peradventure command him to march into Vlster, or Linster; hee
presently dispatched a Letter to the Lord Deputie, signifying unto
him, what direction hee had given unto <hi>Barkley,</hi> and the reasons that
moved him unto it, beseeching his Lordship to allow thereof: But
see the mischiefe, before the Presidents Letters came to the Lord De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties

to obey his instructions, hoping that the Lord President would
bee able to make his peace with the Lord Deputie; but so slow and
negligent was the Presidents Messenger (which afterwards was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused
by sicknesse) as the Lord Deputie had received Sir <hi>Francis
Barklies</hi> refusall, before hee had knowledge of the Presidents Letters:
whereupon hee stormed at the President, and dispatched presently his
Letters to the Lords of the Councell, complayning of the President,
not sparing to tell them, that rather then hee would undergoe so
great an indignity (by any man that served underneath him) hee
would quit his government: And at the same time it fell out so
crossely, that another accident did no lesse moue the Deputie to bee
enraged then the former; for of the two thousand supplyes which
were to come into Mounster, the President (to giue contentment to
many worthy men, that without charge had followed him in the
former services) had obtayned from the Lords in England, that sixe
hundred of them should bee bestowed upon such as he should make
choice of, to bee their Captaines; this added to that aforementioned,
did so much increase his Lordships indignation to the President,
(whereunto many ill disposed, to increase the flame gaue fuell) as his
Lordship wrote this ensuing Letter to the President.</p>

you satisfaction that I am not worthy of this wrong: The Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell

borne you; and in the world you shall not find for ever hereafter a

because my fortune doth otherwayes so little enable me, to shew my

               <p>After that <hi>Don Iuan</hi> was landed and setled in the Towne of Kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sale,

with the appointment of such things as hee advertiseth to be need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
or his succour, and good effect of his voyage; translated out
of a Spanish discourse.</head>
                     <p>ON the first of October hee arrived at the Haven of Kinsale,<note place="margin">Stilo novo.</note> and
the day following, <hi>Don Iuan</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Don Iuan his Certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate into Spaine after his landing in Kinsale.</note> landed all his Souldiers; whereof
framing two squadrons, hee marched towards the said Towne, out
of which there issued fiftie Foote and fourtie Horse, who leaving the
place free, went towards the Towne of Corke; the persons of bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
sort going with them, with all their goods; whereupon there
were presently sent in two Companies, and the day following ente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
all the rest of the Armie, and lodged there, to the end to shelter
the Troopes and munitions under covert, although with great
straightnesse, the place contayning not aboue two hundred houses.</p>
                     <p>The seat and foundation of Kinsale is in a side of a River, inviro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
with hils, aud without any kind of defense, in so much as <hi>Don
Iuan</hi> is of the mind, if the Enemy should come (to quarter himselfe
neere his front) to try his fortune, because otherwise hee should not
bee able to make good the place.</p>
                     <p>There were disembarqued two Field-Peeces, and two Demie-Cannons,
leaving the rest of the Artillerie unlanded, not having Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition
sufficient for so much Artillery, for that the Powder and
Match which remaines is little, and the greater quantitie came wett,
as well as not to bee encombred with so much Artillerie, without
Horses to draw it, since that with the next succors may be sent Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition
enough.</p>

                        <pb n="193" facs="tcp:18000:123"/>There is in the middle of the Haven of Quinsale, a certaine (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
an) Iland, on the which it seemeth good to <hi>Don Iuan</hi> to haue a
Fort made, to secure and defend the Haven; yet is there no conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient
place to doe it: for on the part that lookes towards the place,
an Arme of the Sea divides it from the land, continued somewhat
upwards into the land, without having Pinnaces, Boats, or other
meanes to crosse it: and for that the Towne Quinsale is of so great
a Seat, and open in so many parts, and so weake, that it is needfull
to haue halfe the Troupes in guard at least, whensoever they should
bee forced to draw out to some good effect, which notwithstanding
would not bee in good securitie, the place (almost an Iland) not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
sufficient water, nor is there any place of those adjacent, that
yeeldeth meanes to fortifie it, so that it is necessary to goe elsewhere
for it, having here nothing to make Cisterns nor Pinnases for a pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage,
or to bring bavins and faggots, the River being somewhat far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
upwards into the land.</p>
                     <p>Hee sent to tell <hi>Don Diego Brochero,</hi> that because the way remayned
so ill, hee should assist him before hee went, in causing to be disim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barqued
the Bisquet, and afterwards, that all the boats should make
three or foure voyages for bavins or gabions, whereof hee had great
need; the River as is aforesaid, being somewhat farre aboue, hee an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered
that hee could not attend to this, or disimbarque the Biskets
which came in the hulke, which were there, but to returne present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and so with great haste caused the munitions to bee landed, which
they left upon the shore, without account or reason; the Accounter
and Steward of the Artillery remayning, which would not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
to account for it; and such was the haste, that on the durt and
Ooes of the shore they were ill handled, and wet, as if the Enemy
had beene already playing with their Artillery on their ships. So
soone as <hi>Don Iuan</hi> had lodged himselfe in the place, hee dispatched to
the Earles severall times,<note place="margin">Tyrone. Odonnell.</note> advising them of his arrivall; yet in nine
dayes that passed untill I was dispatched into Spaine, they received
no answer: There is from Kinsale to the place where the Earles
abide seventie fiue Leagues; the naturals of the Countrey report the
forces of the Earles to bee much lesse then was given out to us, and
that the Enemy doth hold them in with forts: The enemies haue
drawen together all their Cattell and Corne, and with their Cavalle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
breake the Mils, and because wee haue no Horse, they presume to
come every day up to our Wals, not being able to avoid or hinder it;
notwithstanding our sallies against them, insomuch that from with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out,
wee receiue neither flesh nor any other thing, except some few
Cowes from the poore people of the place, which they sell the rather

                        <hi>Don Iuan</hi> doth procure to draw from the Countrey people, by loue
and rewards all that he can; yet withall this, findeth no assistance
from them, neither dare they declare themselues, and the greater part
haue no will, seeing the small forces which haue beene landed, but
seeing that there are more, they will bee still comming, and some of
them receiue pay, it is very re quisit to pay them and arme them; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
till now many of them are past to the Enemy: Since the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of this by <hi>Don Iuan de Aquila,</hi> there came a spy from Corke,
where the Enemy doth joyne together, who saith that the Viceroy
had already together more then foure thousand Foote and foure or
fiue hundred Horse, and that the Queene of England had received
advertisement of the comming of the Spaniards into Ireland, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
were great preparations made for the expulsing them; the
Souldiers which were disimbarqued, marched to the number of
three thousand and foure hundred; besides those which came in a
hulke, now arrived three Leagues from hence, but making a squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron
of them, there was a lesse number found, so that it is thought
fit to take the first muster with much rigour, taking note of the
boyes, and such besides of the rest as are <hi>Besognies,</hi> who not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the use of their Peece, nor how to discharge them, are drawen
out to exercise their Armes dayly, many fall sicke, and are already
more then one hundred: It is fit that the succour which his Majesty
meaneth to send, should bee dispatched with speed, because the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
may not haue power to engage the places which <hi>Don Iuan</hi> hath
designed to fortifie: It should bee a matter of great importance, and
the Whole for Horse, by reason of the difference of the Cavallerie,
which commeth out of England and that of the Earles, for all that
can bee leavied in Ireland, or that they haue are small Horses, and the
Souldiers are unarmed, which doe onely fight with halfe Pikes, and
Saddles without stirrops.</p>
                     <p>Of powder and matches as is aforesaid, there is small store, so that
it is necessary to send some good quantitie together with Lead, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
there passed but little.</p>
                     <p>Bisquet and some wine is necessary for the sustenance of our
Troopes, because there came not such a quantitie of Bisquet as his
Majestie commanded, and was not more then for two Moneths or
little more.</p>
                     <p>It is likewise convenient, that there come a great summe of monie,
for it imports much to pay well, for want whereof, there rise no dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders,

That others may come in the place of the Accounter, and overseer

                     <p>It is convenient to send two Doctors, because there is none in the

                     <p>It behooveth also to send Carpenters and Smiths, or Farriers being

                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>T the instant when Sir <hi>Charles Wilmots</hi> Letters of the
Spaniards arrivall came to Kilkenny, which was upon
the three and twentieth of September, as afore mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned;
the Lord Deputie, the Earle of Ormond, the Lord President, Sir <hi>Richard Wingfielde</hi> Marshall of the
Army of Ireland, and Sir <hi>Robert Gardiner</hi> the chiefe Iustice, were in
Councell, advising what course was fittest to take if the Spaniards
should land: But now Sir <hi>Charles Wilmots</hi> Letters gaue them cause
to advise what should be done, they being landed, &amp; to confirme the
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:18000:126"/>same; while they were in Councell, second Letters came from Sir <hi>Charles Wilmot,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Second Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters from Sir Charles Wilmot of the arrivall of the Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards at Kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sale.</note> and the Major of Corke, that the Spaniards had quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the harbour of Corke, and were all at an Anchor in the haven of
Kinsale: The question was then, what the Lord Deputy should
doe: The Earle of Ormond, the Marshall, and the chiefe Iustice
were of opinion, that hee should doe well to hasten to Dublin, and
there to assemble his forces together;<note place="margin">It was deba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell upon the receit of the Letters aforesaid, what was meetest for the Lord Deputy to doe.</note> and whilest they were draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to a head, to giue order for supplyes, of victuals and munitions to
bee sent to Corke; and that the President should presently bee dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched
into the Province, to defend the Citie of Corke, untill the
Lord Deputie came to his reliefe, wherein all expedition was to bee
vsed; for their reasons were, that if the Lord Deputie presented
himselfe in the Province with small forces, it would encourage the
Enemy, and put distrust and feare in the Provincials, which were
either well affected or neutrals.</p>
               <p>The Presidents advise was opposite to theirs,<note place="margin">The Lord President differs in opinion from the rest.</note> beseeching the
Lord Deputy to goe presently into Mounster, although hee had no more
then his Page with him; for said he, if the Provincials shall see that
you turne your backe towards them, they will conceiue it proceeds
of want of force, and then undoubtedly a generall revolt will ensue,
but when they shall see you personally amongst them, that doubt
will be removed; and besides, the Armie (now dispersed) will make
more haste after you, then they would doe if you attended their
comming to Dublin.</p>
               <p>The Lord Deputy inclined to the Presidents Councell,<note place="margin">The Lord Deputy as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented to the L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

what should I doe there, not being able to mainetaine the Armie
with victuals for the space of a weeke, nor to furnish it with muniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
of both which there is no remaine in the Magazines in Dublin:
The President willed him to take no care for those wants, for hee
would furnish him, and the whole Armie for two or three moneths,

victuals, not consuming so much as a Bisquet, for more then sixe
moneths, giving the Souldiers money, and having beene evermore
confident of the Spaniards arrivall, had procured good supplyes of
munitions, which were frugally and sparingly issued: The Lord
Deputy like unto one that was overjoyed with such unexpected pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions,
rose from his Chaire, embraced the President, and said, that
if hee had not beene more then provident, that himselfe did not
know what to haue done, and that his honour had beene indangered,
and ascribed to him what hee well deserved.</p>

must bee by Armes disputed; for upon the successes of this siege, as
these great and important consequences depended: And here the
malice of Rome and Spaine (if they had prevailed) would not haue
ceased, for their purposes did extend it selfe; (Ireland having beene
conquered) to make it their bridge to haue invaded England, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest

that when the Lord Deputy came to Corke, hee presented unto him

that <hi>Florence</hi> was sent prisoner into England, of whose restraint

were advertised, that at Kinsale fiue and thirtie ships arrived with

having in them seven hundred Souldiers, and that they brought with

<pb n="201" facs="tcp:18000:128"/>
There is come unto our eares a Proclamation, or certaine Libell
made in the Citie of Corke, in the Name of the Deputie; which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it conteineth many untruths, and such things as offend the
eares of honest men, lest they may leade and seduce the mindes of
simple men into errours, and turne them from the truth, I am com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled
to shew their falsehood, to lay open the trueth, and in fewe
words to signifie the pretence and intention of our most Excellent
King <hi>Philip,</hi> in this Warre, which is with the Apostolique Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie,
to be administred by us: and (to speake the truth) I could ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
easily retort vpon them those reproaches which they object to us,
and make them lose the pleasure which they haue taken in ill speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
by hearing of the like; Notwithstanding, we will not (like
unto weake and unarmed women) goe to reproachings<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but setting
these things aside, answer to those that are objected with sound truth
and Christian modestie.</p>
                     <p>First of all, yee faine that wee would leade away the pretended
Subjects of the Queene of England from their, obedience, to bring
them under our yoke, which is a very untruth; for wee endeavour
not to perswade any body, that hee should deny due obedience (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the word of God) to his Prince: But yee know well
that for many yeares since, <hi>Elizabeth</hi> was deprived of her kingdome,
and all her Subjects absolved from th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ir fidelity by the Pope, unto
whom, hee that raigneth in the heavens, the King of Kings, hath
committed all power, that hee should roote up, destroy, plant, and
build in such sort, that hee may punish temporall Kings (if it shall be
good for the spirituall building) even to their deposing, which thing
hath beene done in the kingdomes of England and Ireland, by many
Popes, <hi>viz.</hi> by <hi>Pius quintus, Gregory</hi> the thirteenth, and now by <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
the eighth as it is well knowen. Whose Buls are extant amongst
us; (I speake to Catholikes, not to froward Heretikes, who haue
fallen from the faith of the (Romane Church) seeing they are blind
Leaders of the blind, and such as know not the grounds of the truth,
it is no marvell that they doe also disagree from us in this thing: But
our brethren the Catholikes, walking in the purenesse of the faith,
and yeelding to the Catholike Church (which is the very Pillar of
the truth) will easily understand all those things: Therefore it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayneth
that the Irish (which adhere to us) doe worke with us no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
that is against Gods Lawes, or their due obedience, nay that
which they doe is according to Gods word, and the obedience
which they owe the Pope.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, yee affirme that wee Spaniards goe about to winne the
Irish with allurements, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">

                        </gap> (which is a thing farre
from our nature) and that wee doe it but for a while; that after wee

O the immortall God! who doth not wonder at your bitter
and unexpressible cruelty, your boldnesse shewed in these words:
For who is it that doth not know the great cruelty which you Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
haue exercised, and cease not to exercise towards the miserable
Irish: You I say goe about to take from their soules the Catholike
faith which their fathers held, in which consists eternall life; truely
you are farre more cruell then Beares and Lyons, which take away
the temporall life, for you would depriue them of the eternall and
spirituall life. Who is it that hath demolished all the temporalities
of this most flourishing kingdome except the English? looke upon
this and bee ashamed: whereas on the other side wee commisera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the condition of the Catholikes here, haue left our most sweet
and happy Countrey Spaine, that is replenished with all good things;
and being stirred with their cryes, which pierce the heavens, having
reached to the eares of the Pope, and our King <hi>Philip:</hi> They haue
(being moved with pitie) at last resolved to send unto you Souldiers,
Silver, Gold, and Armes with a most liberall hand, not to the end
they might (according as they faine) exercise cruelty towards you,
O Irish Catholikes, but that you may bee happily reduced (being
snatched out of the jawes of the divell, and free from their tyranny)
unto your owne pristine ingenuitie, and that you may freely professe
the Catholike faith: Therefore my most beloved, seeing that which
you haue so many yeares before desired and begged for, with prayers
and teares; and that now, even now, the Pope Christs Vicar on
earth, doth command you to take Armes for the defence of your
faith: I admonish, exhort, and beseech you all; all I say unto whom
these Letters shall come; that as soone as possibly you can, you come to us with your friends and weapons; whosoever shall doe this,
shall find us prepared, and wee will communicate unto them, those
things which wee possesse; And whosoever shall (despising our
wholesome councell) doe otherwise, and remaine in the obedience of
the English, wee will persecute him as an Heretike, and a hatefull
Enemy of the Church even unto death.</p>

(Lieutenant to Captaine <hi>Thomas Butler</hi>) skirmishing with Shot,
the Enemy being hard by them with some two hundred men, and

comming close with their Pikes, whom they presently encountred,

that were hurt, which in all likelihood were many, by reason of the
neernesse of the shot; and as one reporteth, (that came the next day
from Kinsale, and had bin in the Ghesthouse amongst them) 70 were

               <p>All this while the three Peeces played upon the Castle, untill sixe

man borne in Corke, who prayed in the name of the rest, that they
might bee licensed to depart to Kinsale with their Armes, bag and
baggage; this being denyed by the Lord President (who would not
conclude with any, but the Commander of the place) hee returned
the Messenger, willing him to tell the Commander that no other but

them any other composition then to yeeld to her Majesties mercy:

of those which attempted to escape, there were three and twentie
Spaniards taken; and of this Countrey birth a great multitude of
Churles, women and children, there was likewise slaine of the
Spaniards towards thirtie; all this while the Enemy shot not a shot,

               <p>About one houre after day, the Commander sent word to the

Armes, so as they might bee sent to Kinsale, which being refused, hee
intreated onely that himselfe might hold his Armes, and bee sent to

<hi>Roger Harvie,</hi> Captaine of the Guards that night, and himselfe
to weare his sword untill hee came to the President, and then render

with him, eate and dranke with him, and many times had private
conference with him; not seeming to take notice of any treacherous
intent; besides his Army consisting of three thousand or there abouts,
what with Countrey risings out, and under Captaines in pay, two
thousand of these were of Irish birth, no lesse affected to the Rebels
then to themselues; and I can well assure the Reader upon good
grounds, that if our forces had received any disaster, they would all
haue turned Turkes, and cut the throats of their owne Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.</p>

Rincorran, who from the Bushie hill played in flancke upon their

sent out close to our Campe, being beaten backe by our shot, and
thinking to find the seconds they left behind them, were disappoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by the quitting of their trenches, and by that meanes driven to
follow the rest to the succour of the Towne; our men following
them with much furie, hurt and killed divers, amongst whom they
brought off the body of a Sergeant, and possessed the enemies tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
the which the Enemy (being re-enforced) made many attempts
to regaine, but were repulsed and beaten backe into the Towne; we
heard by divers that <hi>Don Iohn</hi> committed the Sergeant Major (who
commanded then in chiefe) presently after the fight, and threatned to
take off his head, commended highly the valor of our men, and cryed
shame upon the cowardise of his owne, who he said had beene the
terror of all nations, but now had lost that reputation, and he gaue
straight commandement upon paine of death (which hee caused to
be set upon the Towne gates) that from thenceforth no man should
come off from any service, untill hee should be fetcht off by his Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer,
though his powder were spent or his Peece broken, but make
good his place with his sword; Captaine <hi>Soto,</hi> one of their best
Commanders was that day slaine,<note place="margin">A Spanish Captaine slaine.</note> for whom they made very great

but bee many; on our side onely some ten hurt and three killed;

and the rather because that day and the two next prooved so
extreame stormie and foule, as the Ordnance could not bee landed,
nor any thing else well done; yet out of an extraordinary desire to
effect somewhat,<note place="margin">17. Nov.</note> the seventeenth being the most happy day of her
Majesties Coronation, which wee meant to haue solemnized with

and to see whether it might be carried with the Pickaxe, which was
accordingly attempted<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but the Engine wee had gotten to defend
our men while they were at worke, being not so strong as it should
haue beene, they within the Castle hauing store of very great stones
on the top, tumbled them downe so fast as brake it, so as they retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
with the losse of two men, and proceeded no further in that
course.</p>
               <p>The same day,<note place="margin">A Councell of Warr cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by the L. Deputie.</note> the Lord Deputie called a Councell of warre,
wherein it was propounded, that now that her Majestie had plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
furnished us with men, munition, and victuals, we wereto
consider of our owne strength, and the best way either to attempt
the Towne or to continue the siege, we were also to consider of the
force of the Enemy within Kinsale, and what aides they were like
to haue out of the Countrey, and of all other commodities, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodities
that were to happen on either side: The conclusion
and resolution was, that wee should invest the Towne with all cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
to keepe it short of reliefe, and before the making of a breach to
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:18000:136"/>breake their houses, that they might find no safetie in them, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
to bee exposed to the like incommoditie of cold and raine as wee
felt in the Campe; in doing whereof it was conceived that many
would bee slaine, and indanger the destroying their magazines of
powder and victuals; for if presently we should make a breach and
attempt it by assault, there was no difference, betweene a weake place
(stored with bodies of men) and a strong fortified Towne; besides
the Enemy had ground sufficient (if a breach were made) to cast up
new earth workes, which would put us to more toyle and losse of
men then an old stone wall; and (in the opinion of all the chiefest of
the Armie) it was concluded, that wee could not doe the Enemy a
greater pleasure, or unto our selues a greater disadvantage, then to
seeke to carie it by a breach, before the forces in the Towne, either by
sword or sicknesse were weakned.</p>

in the Towne made divers shot at Captaine <hi>Tolkernes</hi> Pinnace, with
a piece of Ordnance which they mounted a day or two before close
to the gate of the Towne, but did no hurt at all unto her; the Pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace
warping neerer to the other side under the hill, and at last rode
safely without danger of the shott: The same day a Platforme was
made upon a ground of advantage, (not farre from the Campe) that
commanded one part of the Towne, that under the favour thereof
wee might the better make our neerer Approaches, which at that
time wee could hardly haue done, by reason of the great extreame
frost, and a Demy-cannon mounted vpon it, with which some shot
was made at the Towne, and a Sentinell taken anon after affirmed,

for Kinsale. All the shot were made particularly at his ship,
except some few at a Pinnace of the Queenes, wherein Captaine
<hi>Flemming</hi> was Commander.</p>
               <p>All the time spent upon the nine ten and eleaven, was in erecting
the two forts formerly resolved upon, also in casting up of trenches,
betweene the Earle of Thomonds quarter, and the said forts, being
more then thirtie score in length, and making of trenches neere to
the Lord Deputies Campe: The Spaniards as well to interrupt, as
to view our workes, made certaine light sallies, but they were easily
beaten backe without any hurt on our side.</p>
               <p>The twelfth,<note place="margin">12. Decem.</note> the Enemy sallied againe, but altogether fruitlesse.</p>
               <p>The thirteenth,<note place="margin">13. Decem.</note> the weather fell out to be extreame fowle and stor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my;
and because of <hi>Tyrones</hi> drawing neere with all his forces, it was
thought meet, not to attempt any thing of great moment, more then
the removing of some Peeces of Ordnance, to a new platforme made
on the West side of the Towne close unto it, to play upon the Castles,
which might most hinder our workes, when wee should resolue to
make a breach.</p>
               <p>The fourteenth fowle weather,<note place="margin">14. Decem.</note> wherein nothing was performed.</p>
               <p>The fifteenth,<note place="margin">15. Decem.</note> our Artillery on the West side of the Towne did

as you possibly may: for I doe assure you, the enemies are wearied, and
but few, and that they cannot furnish (with Guards) the third part of their
Trenches, which shall little availe them, their first fury resisted, all is ended.
In what manner your Excellencies will come on, is better known to you there,
then unto me here; I will giue them enough to doe this way, being ever atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to giue the blow in all that I can and with some good resolution, that your
Excellencies fighting as you are accustomed, I hope in God the victorie shal be
ours, for that the cause is his: I doe as much desire the victory for the interest
which your Excellencies haue in it, as for my owne. There is nothing now to be
done, but that you would bring up your Troupes, come well appoynted, and in
close Order, and being once mingled with the enemies, their Forts will doe
them as much harme as us. I salute <hi>Don Ricardo,</hi> the Lord preserue your

whereupon the Enemy must haue drawen in grosse, to force the pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage,

resolved to make that ground good, being of greater advantage for
Horse and Foote, both to bee imbattled, and to fight: upon view
whereof the Lord Deputie sent the Marshall word, that on that place
hee was resolved to giue the Enemy battaile, and sent the Sergeant
Major (Sir <hi>Iohn Barkley</hi>) to draw out Sir <hi>Henry Folliots,</hi> and Sir <hi>Oli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

might imbattle his men, and presently giue on, to joyne that way

their Army to haue forced both our quarters, of the successe whereof
they were so confident, that they reckoned us already theirs, and
were in contention, whose prisoners the Lord Deputie should bee,

the Marshall, and Sir <hi>Henry Davers</hi> to bee advanced with all the

ford at the foote of that hill, (with purpose as he fained) till his whole
Army were drawen more close; instantly the Marshall sent the Lord

gaue order that all the Foote should follow; when we were advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced

The Lord Deputie asked of some that understood the Countrey,
whether beyond that ford,<note place="margin">The Lo. Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

for the Enemy to make advantage of; but being answered that there
was none, but a faire Champion, he drew after the Enemy, and then
desired the Lord President to returne from thence, and secure the
Campe, and attend the sallies of <hi>Don Iuan,</hi> which hee did, with
whom the Lord Deputie sent the Earle of Thomonds Horse, Sir <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:18000:145"/>
Cookes,</hi> and Sir <hi>Oliver Lamberts,</hi> and only tooke with him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
three or foure hundred Horse, and under twelue hundred
Foote, but being drawen out some mile farther, we might perceiue
the Enemy to stand firme, upon a ground of very good advantage for
them, having a bog betweene us, and a deepe ford to passe, and in all
apparance with a resolution to fight: the Marshall being advanced
with the Horse neere unto the Ford, sent unto the Lord Deputie, that
hee perceived the Enemy in some disorder; and that if hee would
giue him leaue to charge, hee hoped to giue a very good account of
it; the Lord Deputie left it to his discretion, to doe as he should find
present occasion, out of the disposition of the Enemy; whereupon
the Earle of Clanrickard that was with the Marshall, importuned
him exceedingly to fight, and the Lord Deputie sent to draw up the
Foote (with all expedition) close together, who marched as fast as it
was possible for them to keepe their orders; the Marshall assoone as
a wing of the Foote of the Vaunt-guard was come up unto him,
and Sir <hi>Henry Power</hi> with his Regiment drawen over the Ford, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced
with some hundred Horse, accompanied with the Earle of
Clanrickard, and gaue occasion of skirmish upon the bog side, with
some hundred hargubisheers; the Enemy thereupon put out some
of their loose shot from their battle, and entertayned the fight: their
three battalions standing firme on the other side of the bog, at the
first our shot were put close to the Horse, but with a second they beat
the enemies loose shot into their battle; and withall the Marshall,
with the Earle of Clanrickard, and Sir <hi>Richard Greame,</hi> offered a
charge on a battle of one thousand Foote, and finding them to stand
firme, wheeled a little about: by this time Sir <hi>William Godolphin</hi> with
the Lord Deputies Horse, and Captaine <hi>Mynshall</hi> with the Lord
Presidents Horse, (who were appointed to keepe still in grosse, to
answer all accidents) was come up, and Sir <hi>Iohn Barkley</hi> with two
of our three bodies of Foote: whereupon the Marshall with the
Earle of Clanrickard, vnited themselues with Sir <hi>Henry Davers,</hi>
Captaine <hi>Taffe</hi> and Captaine <hi>Fleming,</hi> charged againe the Horse, and
the reare of the same battle, who presently thereupon, both Horse
and Foote fell into disorder and brake.</p>
               <p>All this while the Vantgard of the Enemies in which was <hi>Terrill,</hi>
and all the Spaniards, stood firme upon a Bog on the right hand, unto
whom, within Calievers shotthe Lord Deputie had drawen up our
Reare upon a little hill, and willed them to stand firme, till they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
direction from him: but perceiving the grosse drawing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
our men that were following the execution, and the other
Bodies of foot, he drew up that squadron, (commanded by Captaine
<hi>Roe</hi>) to charge them in Flanck; whereupon they presently drew off,
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:18000:145"/>
and in a great grosse marched to the top of the next hill, and there
for a little time) made a stand; the Reare of the Enemy beeing in

many of their Armes,<note place="margin">A glorious victory.</note> their Battell (being the greatest Body) was
put all to the sword, and not aboue some sixtie escaped: The Vant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guard
who went last off, were broken on the top of the hill; the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish
for the most part quit the Spanyards, who making a stand, were
broken by the Lord Deputies Troopes, and most of them killed, <hi>O
Campo</hi> the chiefe Commaunder taken prisoner by the Cornet, <hi>Iohn
Pykman,</hi> two Captaines 7. Alferoes, and 40. Souldiers taken prisoners
by such as followed the execution, which continued a mile &amp; a halfe,
and left there, onely tyred with killing: There were of the Irish re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bells
twelue hundred dead bodies left in the place, and as we heard
from themselues, about eight hundred hurt, whereof many of them
dyed that night: they lost aboue two thousand Armes, their Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
Drummes, and nine Ensignes, which was more then ever they
had together before; of Captaines, (besides other men of marke)
foureteene were slaine, and on our side onely Sir <hi>Richard Greames</hi>
Cornett was killed, Sir <hi>Henrie Davers</hi> hurt with a sword slightly,
Sir <hi>William Godolphin</hi> a little rased on the thigh with a Halbert, Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
<hi>Crofts</hi> the Scout-Master with a shot in the backe, and not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue
fiue or sixe common Souldiers hurt, many of our horses killed,
and more hurt: The Earle of <hi>Clanricard</hi> had many faire escapes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
shot through his Garments, and no man did bloody his sword
more then his Lordship that day, and would not suffer any man to
take any of the Irish prisoners, but bad them kill the Rebells. After
the Retreit was sounded, the Lord Deputie did giue the Order of
Knighthood to the Earle of <hi>Clanricard,</hi> in the field in the midst of
the dead bodies, and returning backe to the Campe, drew out the
whole Armie, and gaue God thankes for this Victorie with their
prayers; At the ending whereof, and a volley of shott for joy dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged,
<hi>Don Iuan</hi> (who was attentiue to heare of the Spanyards ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach)
hearing the volley, and conceiving that his Ayds were in
fight with us, made a salley out of the Towne; but when hee per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
the Spanish Colours to be carried by Englishmen in triumph,
he made a speedy retreit. The Enemies Armie, as <hi>Alonso de o Campo</hi>
doth assure us, was sixe thousand Foote, and fiue hundred Horse;
there were some of the Irish taken Prisoners, that offered great ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somes,
but presently upon their bringing to the Campe, they were
hanged.</p>
               <p>Although no man is lesse credulous then my selfe is of idle Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesies,<note place="margin">An old Irish prophesie pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved true.</note>
the most whereof are coyned after things are done, yet I
make bold to relate this which succeeds, for long before the thing

I speake of was brought to light: my selfe was an eye witnesse when
it was reported; in concealing it I should wrong the trueth, which
makes mee bold to remember it: Many times I did heare the Earle
of <hi>Thomond</hi> tell the Lord President, that in an old Booke of Irish pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesies
which hee had seene, it was reported, that towards the latter
dayes there should bee a battell fought betweene the English and the
Irish, in a place which the Booke nameth, neere unto Kinsale. The
Earle of <hi>Thomond</hi> comming out of England, &amp; landing first at Castle-haven,
and after at Kinsale, as aforesaid: in the time of the siege, my
selfe and divers others heard him againe report the Prophesie to the
President, and named the place, where (according to the Prophesie)
the field should bee fought: the day whereupon the victorie was
obtained, the Lord President and the Earle rode out to see the dead
bodies of the vanquished, and the President asked some that were
there present, by what name that ground was called; they not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to what end hee did demand it, told him the true name thereof,
which was the same which the Earle so often before had reported
to the President. I beseech the Reader to beleeue mee, for I deliver
nothing but trueth: but as one Swallow makes no Summer, so
shall not this one true Prophesie increase my credulitie in old Predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
of that kinde.</p>

the Drum Major out of the Towne, with a sealed
Letter to the Lord Deputie,<note place="margin">A Parley desired by Don Iuan and granted by the Lord Deputie.</note> by an Alfeeres, by which he
required (as by the Copie thereof conveyed in the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch
by Sir <hi>Richard Morison</hi> into <hi>England</hi> may appeare)
that some Gentleman of speciall trust and sufficiencie, might bee sent
into the Towne from his Lordship to conferre with him, whom he
would acquaint with such conditions as hee then stood upon;
which being granted by his Lordship, Sir <hi>William Godolphin</hi> was em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
in that negotiation; which in what sort it was carried, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it importeth much, in respect of many particularities of speciall
moment to bee considered; it is thought necessary it should bee here
more largely delivered, his first conference with Sir <hi>William Godol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phin</hi>
tendeth to this:<note place="margin">Don Iuan his propositions,</note> That having found the Lord Deputie (whom
he termeth the Viceroy) although a sharpe and powerfull <hi>Opposito,</hi>
yet an honourable Enemy, and the Irish not onely weake and barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,
but (as hee feared) perfidious friends, hee was so farre in his
affection reconciled to the one, and distasted with the other, as did
invite him to make an overture of such a composition, as might bee
safe and profitable for the State of England, with lesse prejudice to
the Crowne of Spaine, by delivering into the Viceroyes power the
Towne of Kinsale, with all other places in Ireland, held by the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish,
so as they might depart upon honourable termes, fitting such
men of warre, as are not by necessitie enforced to receiue conditions,
but willingly enduced for just respects, to disengage themselues, and
to relinquish a people, by whom their King and Master had beene so
notoriously abused, if not betrayed: That if the Viceroy liked to
entertaine further parly touching this poynt, he would first be pleased
to understand them rightly, and to make his propositions such, as
might bee sutable to men throughly resolved, rather to bury them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
aliue, and to endure a thousand deaths, then that to giue way
to one Article of accord, that should tast of basenes or dishonour, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:18000:149"/>
so confident of their present strength, and the Royall second of
Spaine, that they should make no doubt of yeelding good account of
themselues, and their interest in this kingdome: But that a just dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine,
and spleene conceived against the nation, disswaded them from
being further engaged for it, then of force they must: Sir <hi>William
Godolphin</hi> being commanded by the Lord Deputie onely to receiue
<hi>Don Iuans</hi> propositions and demands, having made his Lordship and
Councell this relation,<note place="margin">The An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer.</note> was by them returned with the Answer fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing.
That howbeit the Lord Deputie having lately defeated
their succours, did so well understand his owne strength and their
weaknesse, as made him nothing doubt of forcing them within a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
short time, whom hee did know to bee pressed with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>
difficulties, how much soever they laboured to cover and conceale
the same: Yet knowing that her sacred Majestie, out of her gratious
and mercifull disposition, would esteeme the glory of her victory to
be blemished by a voluntary effusion, and an obstinate expence of
Christian blood, was content to entertaine this offer of agreement,
so as it might bee concluded under such honourable articles of her
Highnesse, as the advantage shee had against them gaue reason to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
being the same, which are sent with this dispatch Signed by
<hi>Don Iuan,</hi> the leaving of his Treasure, Munition, Artillery, and the
Queenes naturall Subjects to her disposition onely excepted: All
which poynts he did peremptorily refuse, with constant asseveration,<note place="margin">Don Iuan his reply.</note>
that both hee and all his would rather endure the last of misery, then
bee found guilty of so fowle a treason, against the honour of his
Prince, and the reputation of his profession, though hee should find
himselfe unable to subsist, much more now, when he might not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
hope to sustaine the burthen of the warre for a time, but with pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience
and constancie in the end to overcome it: That hee tooke it
so ill, to be understood in having Articles of that nature propounded
unto him, as were they but once againe remembred in the capitula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
the Viceroy should from henceforth use the advantage of his
sword, and not the benefit of his former offers; adding that the Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roy
might rather thinke to haue made a good and profitable purchase,
for the crowne of England, if with expence of two hundred thousand
Duckets, hee had procured <hi>Don Iuan</hi> to quit his interest and footing,
but in <hi>Baltimore,</hi> to say nothing of Kinsale, Castlehaven, and Beere-haven;
for (said hee) suppose that all we (with the rest of our places
here) had perished, yet would that <hi>Pen-Insula</hi> (being strong in its
owne nature) bettered by our art and industry, provided (as it is) of
victuals, munition, and of good Artillery, preserue unto the King of
Spaine, a safe and commodious por<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

bee able to maintaine it selfe againt a land Army of ten thousand,
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:18000:149"/>
untill Spaine (being so deeply engaged) did in honour releeue them,
which would draw on a more powerfull invasion then the first, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
undertaken upon false grounds, as the instance of a base and bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous
people, who in discovering their weaknesse, and want of

                  </gap>e his people that are ingaged,
and to cancell the memory of our former disaster: But this was spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
(said he) in case the Viceroy were able to force this Towne, as I
assure my selfe hee cannot, having upon mine honour within these
wals, at this instant aboue two thousand fighting men, that are strong
and able, besides those which having beene sicke and hurt, recover
daily: The greatest part of these composed of old Souldiers, which
fall not but by the sword, and those that were new, being now both
trayned to their Armes, and growen acquainted with the Climat, are
more able to endure then at the first; our meanes are good as it hath
beene, anytime these two moneths; such as the Spaniards can well
away withall, and thereof to suffice us for three moneths more; we
lodge in good warme houses, haue store of munition, and (which is
best of all) stand well assured that our succours will be shortly here;
to be plaine, wee preserue our men, and reserue our strength the best
wee may, hoping to front you in a breach, which if our hearts faile
us not, wee haue hands and breasts enough to stop against treble your
forces; though I will giue the Viceroy this right, that his men are
passing good, but spent and tired out with misery of a winter siege,
which hee hath obstinatly mainetained beyond my expectation, but
with such caution, and upon so good guard, as having nicely watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
all advantages; I could never fasten a salley yet upon him, but
with losse to my selfe, wherein I must acknowledge my hopes decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
that grounding on some error in his approaches, promised my
selfe the defeat of at least one thousand men at one blow; but when
we meet on the breach, I am confident (upon reason) to lay fiue hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
of your best men on the earth, and rest hopefull that the losse of
those will make a great hole in an Army, that hath already suffered so
much extreamity; but to conclude our busines, the King my master
sent me to assist the Condees <hi>Oneale</hi> and <hi>Odonnell,</hi> presuming on their
promise that I should haue joyned with them, within few dayes of
the arrivall of his forces; I expected long in vaine, sustayned the
Viceroyes Armes, saw them drawen to the greatest head they could
possible make, lodged within two miles of Kinsale, reenforced with
certaine Companies of Spaniards, every houre promising to releeue
us, and being joyned together to force your Campes, saw them at
last broken with a handfull of men, blowen asunder into divers
parts of the world; <hi>Odonnell</hi> into Spaine, <hi>Oneale</hi> to the furthest part of

my master, from assisting a people so unable in themselues, that the
whole burthen of the warre must lye upon him, and so perfidious,
as perhaps might bee enduced in requitall of his favour, at last to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray
him.</p>
               <p>Vpon relation made by Sir <hi>William Godolphin</hi> to the Lord Deputie
and Councell of these offers of <hi>Don Iuan,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The reasons which moved the Lo. De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putie and Councell to yeeld to a Composition.</note> which at severall Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences
had been brought to such heads, as by the Articles betweene
them is more particularly specified, it was thought good (for divers
important reasons) to proceed roundly to the agreement: for where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
in the Propositions by him made, there was not any thing that
admitted exceptions on our part, but onely that hee required to
carry with him his Ordnance, Munition and Treasure, that being
no way prejudiciall to the maine scope, or drift of our Treatie, which
chiefely respected the common good, and safetie of the Kingdome,
deserved not almost to bee thought upon. Besides that, the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
being at first but one hundred thousand Duckets, with foure
moneths payment of so many men, and other necessary deductions,
could not bee but very neere wasted, and that little remainder more
fit for a prey to the poore Souldiers, (after this tedious travell) then
for a clause in the Composition. Furthermore, how needfull it was
to embrace this accord, may clearely bee seene by whosoever con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidereth
the state of our Armie, almost utterly tyred, how full of
danger and difficultie it was to attempt a Breach, defended by so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
hands; how long time it might haue cost us (if wee had lodged
in the Breach) before wee could haue carried the Towne, being full
of strong Castles; how her Majesties Ships, and others being in the
Harbour, should haue beene forced speedily to forsake us for want
of victualls; how our selues were not provided for aboue six dayes
at the time of this parley; that wee had neither Munition, nor Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillerie,
but for one Battery, in one place at once, fiue of our Peeces
being before crazed: And finally, that if wee had missed of our
purpose, the whole Countrey had been hazarded: Furthermore,
that which seemed of greatest consequence to enduce his Lordship to
this agreement, was, that the Spanyards in Baltemore, Castlehaven,
and Beerehaven,<note place="margin">Build your enemy a sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver bridge to waft him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, if he bee potent, or not hopelesse of supplies.</note> by vertue of this Contract, were likewise to sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render
those places, and depart the Countrey, which how hard a
matter it would haue prooved, and how long and dangerous a war
it would haue drawn on, to root them out, they being strongly forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
and well stored with victuals, Munition and Artillery, may easily
bee conjectured, for that of necessitie the Armie (for some space)
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:18000:150"/>
must haue rested, and in the end haue been constrained after a new
supply of necessaries, (to her Majesties intollerable charges) to trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
themselues thither by Sea, the way by land being unpassable, in
which time their Succours out of Spaine, in all likelihood would
haue been come unto them; the King being so farre engaged in his
Honour to second his enterprise, and wee barred of that prosecution
of the Rebells, which now by this Agreement wee may wholly
intend.</p>
               <p>For which considerations, the Lo: Deputie and Councell thought
it in their wisdomes meet, to condescend to more indifferent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions,
which beeing propounded and agreed upon by <hi>Don Iuan,</hi>
these Articles ensuing were signed and sealed on both parts.</p>

<pb n="249" facs="tcp:18000:152"/>
or no, the successe prooved it to bee of very great consequence: for
though the newes of the defeat of the Irish Armie were come into
<hi>Spaine</hi> by <hi>O Donnell,</hi> and those with him, yet <hi>Don Iohn</hi> stood firme in
Kinsale without danger to be much pressed by the Deputy, soliciting
new forces, hoping thereby to repaire their former losses, to reunite
their dispersed Companies, and to overthrow the English forces,
being much spent and sore weakened by their Winter siege: Before
the arrivall of <hi>O Donnell</hi> Seconds were in preparing, and after his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rivall
both increased, and much hastened, as may appeare by the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
intercepted, which came out of <hi>Spaine</hi> to <hi>Don Iohn,</hi> when hee
was at Corke, both from the King of <hi>Spaine,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Lerma,</hi> the
Secretary <hi>Ibarra,</hi> and others: But when they understood by those
men, that <hi>Don Iohn</hi> had compounded for the rendering of Kinsale,
and for their returning into <hi>Spaine,</hi> it then put them to a stand for
their proceedings, and at last concluded to giue over the attempt, fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
so little assistance either in the power or courage of the Irish:
And if this had not fallen out thus, and that those seconds had come
and landed in <hi>Ireland,</hi> it might haue beene much doubted, or rather
positiuely beleeved the contrary, that those Spanyards would not
haue been bound by <hi>Don Iohns</hi> Articles, but haue taken their best op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunitie
of their force and power, in kindling a new flame, and
making that Kingdome againe in as desperate an estate as ever here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore
it hath been, if not worse.</p>

were sent for Vlster, then <hi>Tyrone</hi> required but fower or fiue thousand

he should send strongly; because neither <hi>Tyron<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Hee saith, that when the Army came for Ireland, out of a desire to
establish religion, and to procure to the Irish Lords some greater go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
in the Realme, he came voluntary hither, without pay, but
protests that hee never wished that the Crowne of Ireland should be
taken from the Queene: Hee saith, hee never heard of any of Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
that by Letters did sollicit this invasion, but <hi>Iames Mac Sorley,</hi>
who (as hee heard) writ to the King; that <hi>Florence</hi> did write unto
the King hee knowes not, but <hi>Tyrone</hi> did write unto this Examinat
that <hi>Florence</hi> would bee in Armes with him against her Majestie.</p>
               <p>Hee saith, that hee thinketh, that if the Spaniards had prevailed
in this Enterprise, that their meaning was not to possesse themselues
of Ireland, but from hence to haue invaded England, and to haue en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertayned
the Irish Nation in that enterprise.</p>
               <p>Being demanded, if the English had beene beaten out of Ireland,
what government should haue beene here established, and who
should haue governed; hee answered that therein he is wholly igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,
but when <hi>Tyrone</hi> did write for aide, he saith (that hee thinketh)
that when the English were banished and expelled, that then hee
would submit himselfe to bee dealt withall as pleased the King.</p>
               <p>Hee saith, that in March next, hee thinketh that supplyes should
haue beene sent to <hi>Don Iuan,</hi> but now hee is of opinion, that never
any more will bee sent into Ireland.</p>
               <p>Hee saith, that the reason, that now hee desired the President to
bring him to the Lord Deputie, was because he was altogether wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to serue with the Irish, and also commanded so to doe by <hi>Tyrone</hi>
after his overthrow.</p>
               <p>Hee was commanded by <hi>Tyrone</hi> (the next morning after the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw)
to repaire to the Lord Deputie, and to tell his Lordship, that
hee was willing and desirous to become a Subject, if hee may bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,
and justly dealt withall; and to redeeme his errors past, hee
professed to doe all possible service to her Majestie, but that he would
not leaue his Sonne hostage for him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="256" facs="tcp:18000:158"/>
Hee saith, that hee thinketh upon his conscience, that <hi>Odonnell</hi>
went into Spaine without any advise of <hi>Tyrones,</hi> and that <hi>Redmond
Burke</hi> and Captaine <hi>Mostian</hi> went likewise without his consent.</p>
               <p>Which done, being sorry, as he protested, of his traytorly life, hee
humbly craved her Majesties gracious protection, promising to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
the same with future loyall service; which being graunted, hee
departed. Vpon the fourth of this moneth<note place="margin">4. Febr.</note> (as aforesayd) having
beene in the meane time with <hi>Tyrone,</hi> hee made his second addreffe
to the President, the Lord Deputie then being in Corke, and being
called before the Lord Deputie and the President,<note place="margin">Rich. Owen his message from Tyrone to the Lord Deputie.</note> he dlivered unto
them a Message from <hi>Tyrone,</hi> the effect whereof was, that he would
be glad to be received into her Majesties mercie, being heartily sorry
that hee had given her so just a cause of offence, and likewise grieved
in his soule, that hee had been the cause of the effusion of so much
blood, the exhausting of her Majesties Treasures, and the ruine of
his natiue Countrey; Neverthelesse this pretended griefe and humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie
was farced with some exorbitant conditions, unmeet for him
to demaund from his Soveraigne, (whom hee had highly offended)
or for a Monarch to graunt to a vassall: Notwithstanding it was
thought good to take hold of the occasion; for although it should
not worke the end desired, (which was to settle the Kingdome in
tranquillitie) yet a motion onely of submission, proceeding from the
capitall Rebell, would worke in the mindes of the inferiour Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
a mistrust of their estates, and seeke by his Example, to sue for
grace while there was time, wherein they might hope to obtaine it:
Vpon these considerations the Lord Deputie was willing (after hee
had shewed his dislike to the Conditions) to embrace the motion;
And because that he might be assured to haue a true report returned,
Captaine <hi>George Blunt</hi> (who had been a familiar and inward friend
unto <hi>Tyrone,</hi> when hee was a Subject) was imployed in this busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse;
and for his manner of treating with him, hee had these In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions
following, subscribed by the Lord Deputie, and the Lord
President.</p>
               <p>When you speake with <hi>Tyrone,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Instructions for Captaine Geo: Blunt.</note> you shall tell him, that you under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
that <hi>Richard Owen</hi> came from him to the Lord Deputie, with
Commission from him to tell his Lordship, that hee desired to bee
received into the Queenes mercy, if his life might be secured.</p>
               <p>Whereupon you finding in him such conformitie (out of your an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
loue, which in former time you bare him) were glad of the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration,
and therefore as his friend did now undertake this long
Iourney, to perswade him to those courses which might best answer
his dutie to his Prince, and repayre his estate, which in your opinion
is desperate.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="257" facs="tcp:18000:158"/>
If you find him desirous to bee received to mercie, you shall giue
him hope of it, and promise him furtherance for the effecting of it,
upon these conditions: That he shall in token of his penitency, and
according to the dutie of a Subject to his Naturall Prince, first under
his hand write a letter of submission to the Lord Deputie, humbly
craving in the same her Majesties mercy, with promise to redeeme
his errours past by his future service; That likewise he shall write a
publique Submission to her Majestie, imploring at her hands for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuenesse
of his faults, and likewise promise amendment of his life,
with a willing desire to doe her some acceptable service, in recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
of his transgression, in the same protesting to serue her Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie
against all men, either of Ireland, or Forreiners that shall endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
the disturbance of this Countrey.</p>
               <p>That he shall put into her Majesties hands his eldest Sonne, for the
assurance of his future loyaltie, and foure principall Gentlemen of
his blood, as he formerly promised.</p>
               <p>That hee shall at his charge finde workmen to build such Forts in
the Countrey of <hi>Tyrone,</hi> and in such places as the Lord Deputy shall
thinke fit.</p>
               <p>That he shall permit throughout <hi>Tyrone,</hi> her Majesties Officers of
Iustice, as the Sheriffes and others, to haue free liberty to execute their
Offices, as is accustomed in other Provinces and Counties of the
Realme, and answer all other duties formerly promised.</p>
               <p>That hee shall onely undertake for himselfe, and his Pledges to
lye for no more, then those that dwell upon that land onely that is
contayned in his Letters Patents, not any way undertaking for the
rest of Tyrone, as <hi>Tirlogh Brassiloes</hi> sonnes, <hi>Mac Maghon, O Can<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>, Mac
Guire, Mac Genis,</hi> the two <hi>Clandeboyes,</hi> and all of the East side of Ban.
That if any of his neighbours shall continue in rebellion, none of
their people shall be harboured in Tyrone, and likewise that none of
Tyrone shall (by his consent or knowledge) succour any Rebell, or
giue assistance to them; and if any such offendor shall happen to be
discovered, either by himselfe, or any other her Majesties Officers,
upon knowledge thereof, that hee shall doe his best endeavour to
prosecute the parties offending, and either take them, whereby they
may be tryed by the Lawes of the Realme, or kill them, if they may
not otherwise bee had, and shall assist her Majesties Officers, in ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
to her use the goods and chattells of the Offenders, and their
retinues: That he shall not onely truely pay all her Majesties Rents
and Duties from this time forward, due unto her out of Tyrone,
but also pay the Arrerages, that for many yeares haue been by him
detayned.</p>
               <p>That in respect of the great charges that hee hath put her Majestie
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:18000:159"/>
unto, (although it bee not the thousand part of her disbursements)
<hi>In nomine paenae</hi> (which in all such great offences is accustomed) to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the victualling of her Majesties Garisons, hee shall pay two
thousand Cowes within sixe moneths: That the Countrey of <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rone</hi>
may bee limited, and no more, by him to be possessed, then is
contayned in his Letters Pattents: That the territory of <hi>Tyrone</hi>
might bee divided into shieres, and haue Goales as hee hath formerly
desired: That hee put at liberty the Sonnes of <hi>Shane Oneale;</hi> and all
other prisoners, English and Irish: These things you shall only pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound
as from your selfe, yet as conceiving that they will be deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
at his hands, if hee be received, and to draw as large an overture
from him, of what hee will agree unto, as you can perswade him,
telling him, that the greater assurance he doth giue the estate of his
loyaltie, the greater will bee his safetie, for wee shall conster his good
meaning, by his free offer thereof, and after wee shall haue the lesse
reason to bee jealous of him.</p>

hold, that it, and that which goes with it, were with your Lordship, certifying
you that as much is done (as may be) for your supply in all things: I wrote
unto your Lordship, that there were two Companies of Horse ready to be sent
unto you, but now I say there is three, and in them two hundred and twenty
Souldiers well armed, and horsed; and it please God they shall be all embar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qued

Beanes and Rice, and sixe hundred Arrobas of Oyle; and moreover, besides

<hi>Moreles,</hi> and of that which hee hath told mee of the seat of the place, and of
the small number of men your Lordship hath, I feele my selfe grieved; but
when I call to mind, what a person <hi>Don Iuan de Aguila</hi> is, the way is open
unto me, to expect great matters, and I hope God will grant the same accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

these places being as well knowen to the Spaniards, as to vs, and further
withall to erect Cittadels at Limerick, Corke, and Waterford, though it bee
onely to assure the Townes from revolt. It appeareth by the King of
Spaines Letter, (and so by the Duke of Lermaes, that his heart is very much
set vpon the enterprise of Ireland, and therefore it is not unlike but that he
may send more supplies, after or before <hi>Don Iuans</hi> arrivall in Spaine, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
vnder him, or some other Commaunder; which if he doe, it is also like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the same will be sent shortly: For prevention thereof (if in your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships
wisedome it shall be thought meet) we doe humbly beseech, that the foure
thousand supplyes heretofore desired, and by your Lordships intended, may
be presently sent hither, whereof two thousand to bee erected in Companies,
and their Captaines to bee named heere, and the other two thousand for the
supplyes of the Armie, which is exceeding weake; for our men die daily in
greater numbers then they dyed in the Campe, the infection being greater,
and by some thought, a kinde of plague, (for the people in the Townes dye in
farre greater numbers then the Souldiers) though wee hope the contrarie:
And we doe further desire, that her Majestie will bee pleased to hasten her
Fleet to the coast of Spaine, which comming timely, will in our opinions hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
any enterprise for Ireland; But lest that should faile, wee renew our
former motion, that the Tremontania and the Moone may bee returned to
serue upon the coast of Mounster, that the proportions of Munition and
Victuals desired in our former Letters, may speedily bee dispatched hither,
and that victualls without impediment may come for all places to releeue
vs: for already a very great dearth is begun, and a famine must ensue, the
rates of all things being incredible, and the new Money much repyned at,
which notwithstanding wee doe our uttermost endeavors to advance it. But
in a matter of so great importance, we humbly desire your Lordships to giue
vs leaue to deliver our opinions freely, having so assured ground for it, that if
the King of Spaine continue his Warre in this Countrey, it will bee hard to
preserue her Majesties Army and kingdome, without the altering of the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
money, so generall is the dislike thereof, and so insolently doe they begin
already to refuse it; but if there come no other forraine aid, her Majesty (as
we thinke) may securely continue it as it is: For all we that are of the Army,
whom it most concerneth, (in regard we liue wholly upon our entertainment)
will (God willing) endure it for the advancement of the service, though wee
are sensible of our losse, by the excessiue enhansing of the prizes of all things
that we are to liue upon, which cannot be holpen so long as this new Coyne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues

at Castle-haven the Ianuary, the next day after he came to the
Groyne, where he was nobly received by the Earle of <hi>Caraçena,</hi> who
invited <hi>Odonnell</hi> to lodge in his house; but hee being Sea sicke, in good
manner refused his curtesie; wherefore the Earle lodged him in a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
faire house, not farre from his; but when his sea-sicknesse was
past, he lodged in the Earles house; and upon the twenty seventh of Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuary,
<hi>Odonnell</hi> departed from the Groyne, accompanied by the Earle
and many Captaines, and Gentlemen of quality, who evermore gaue
<hi>Odonnell</hi> the right hand, which within his government he would
not haue done to the greatest Duke in Spaine; and at his depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
hee presented <hi>Odonnell</hi> with one thousand duckets, and that
night hee lay at <hi>Santa Lucia:</hi> the Earle of <hi>Caraçena</hi> being returned,
the next day hee went to <hi>Saint Iames</hi> of <hi>Compostella,</hi> where he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
with magnificence by the Prelats, Citizens, and religious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
and his lodging was made ready for him at <hi>Saint Martins,</hi> but
before hee saw it, hee visited the Archbishop, who instantly prayed
him to lodge in his house; but <hi>Odonnell</hi> excused it: The nine and
twentieth the Archbishop saying Masse with pontificall solemnity,
did minister the Sacrament to <hi>Odonnell,</hi> which done hee feasted
him at dinner in his house; and at his departure hee gaue him one
thousand duckets: The King understanding of <hi>Odonnels</hi> arrivall,
wrote unto the Earle of <hi>Caraçena</hi> concerning the reception of him,
and the affaires of Ireland, which was one of the most gratious Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
that ever King directed; for by it, it plainely appeared that hee
would endanger his kingdome to succour the Catholikes of Ireland,
to their content, and not faile therein; for the perfecting whereof,
great preparations were in hand: <hi>Odonnell</hi> caried with him to the
Court, <hi>Redmond Burke, Father Florence,</hi> Captaine <hi>Mostian,</hi> and nine
Gentlemen more, where they were nobly received; although the
knowledge of the reception of <hi>Odonnell</hi> in Spaine, was not well
knowen by mee untill after the taking of Dunboy, yet I thought it
requisite to insert it in its due place, according to the time of his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at the Groyne: But now let us returne to the affaires of Mounster.</p>

the Irish, and especially those who had voluntarily delivered into his
hands their Castles, but especially <hi>Donnell Osulevan,</hi> who considering,
that if his Castle of <hi>Donboy</hi> should bee in the possession of the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish,
hee was like to be banished his Countrey, not having any hope
of favour from her Majestie, unto whose Crowne and Dignitie hee
had manifested himselfe to bee a malicious Traytor, resolved to set
up his rest in regaining of it out of the Spanyards hands, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
to defend it against her Majesties Forces as well as hee might:
For accomplishing whereof, they watched a fit opportunitie, and
surprized it in this sort: Although the Spaniards were the Masters
of the Castle, yet evermore he had recourse into it, &amp; lodged therein
with such of his men as hee thought good: In the dead time of the
night, when the Spanyards were soundly sleeping, and the key of the
Castle in the Captaines custody, <hi>Osulevan</hi> caused his men, (amongst
the which there were some Masons) to breake a hole in the wall,
wherein fourescore of his men entered, for by appoyntment he had
drawne that night close unto the Castle, <hi>Archer</hi> the Iesuite with an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other

Saaredra</hi> the Spanish Captaine to goe with him to <hi>Osulevans</hi> cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
unto whom hee made relation, that his men were entred the
Castle, that he meant no personall hurt, either unto him, or to any of
his, and that he would keepe the same for the King of <hi>Spaines</hi> use;
and also told him, that hee had one thousand Foot within Harque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>busse
shott of the Castle. The Captaine seeing himselfe surprized,
made no resistance, and willed his men to doe the like: But the
Spanyards in furie discharged a few Musket shott amongst the Irish,
and slew three of them, and hurt one: but by the mediation of <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulevan,</hi>
and <hi>Francesco de Saavedra,</hi> the Captaine, all was pacified,
<hi>Osulevan</hi> being very carefull that no hurt might bee done to the
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:18000:166"/>
Spanyards: Afterward <hi>Osulevan</hi> disarmed them all, kept the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,
and a few of the better sort, with three or foure Gunners, in
the nature of Prisoners, and the rest hee sent to Baltimore, to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barqued
into <hi>Spaine:</hi> He also seazed upon all the Spanish Ordnance,
Munitions, and Victualls, which was there in store. The Captaine
not long after was set at libertie, and returned with the <hi>Veador</hi> from
Baltimore into Spaine, and with him the other souldiers which were
detained, but the Cannoniers <hi>Osulevan</hi> reserved.</p>
               <p>When report was brought to <hi>Don Iohn de Aguila</hi> (then in Corke)
of the surprize of Dunboy, he tooke it for a great affront, and would
presently haue drawen from Kinsale (the Spanish Companies there
yet remayning) and march to Dunboy to regaine it by force, and to
deliver it according to the Composition into her Majesties hands:
But the Lord Deputie and the President, (who were desirous to see
his heeles towards Ireland) wished him not to trouble himselfe with
that businesse; and when hee was gone, the President should take
order for the reducing of it into his hands: the Castle of Dunboy
was surprized (as beforesayd) in this moneth of February, 1601, and
held by <hi>Osulevan</hi> to the use of the King of Spaine: but yet to excuse
himselfe unto the King, and to make it appeare unto him how much
hee was his servant, hee wrote unto him, to the Earle of <hi>Carazena,</hi>
and to <hi>Pedro de Zubiare,</hi> there being at that present in Beerehaven, the
Spanish Pinnace, which brought the Pacquet from Spaine (intercep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

doth make bold to enforme unto your greatnesse, that upon the landing in
Castle-haven, in the West of Ireland, your Generall <hi>Pedro de Zubiar,</hi> and
<hi>Pedro Lopez de Soto,</hi> with a fleet and men from your Greatnesse, according
to the inward conceit of mind I alwayes held, which I manifested in my young
yeares, and would haue still followed, unlesse disability had constrayned mee
to the contrary; finding a happy and good opportunity (as I imagined) I
I came to their presence, tendering my obeysance unto them in the name of
your Highnesse, and being with foure hundred men at my owne cost, towards
your service, I yeelded out of my meere loue and goodwill, without compulsion
or composition, into their hands in the name of your Majestie; not onely my
Castle, and Haven called Beerehaven, but also my Wife, my Children, my
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:18000:167"/>
Countrey, Lordships, and all my possessions for ever to be disposed of at your
pleasure. They received mee in that manner, and promised (as from your
Highnesse) to keepe, and saue the said Castle, and Haven during the service
of your grace: Notwithstanding my gratious Lord, conclusions of peace
were assuredly agreed upon, betwixt <hi>Don Iuan de Aguila</hi> and the English,
a fact pittifull, and (according to my judgement) against all right and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
conscience. Among other places whereof your greatnesse was dispos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed
in that manner, which were neither yeelded nor taken to the end they
should bee delivered to the English; <hi>Don Iuan</hi> tyed himselfe to deliver my
Castle and Haven, the onely key of mine inheritance, whereupon the living
of many thousand persons doth rest, that liue some twentie leagues upon the
Sea Coast, into the hands of my cruell, cursed, misbeleeving Enemies, a thing
I feare in respect of the execrablenesse, inhumanity, and ingratefulnesse of
the fact if it take effect, as it was plotted, that will giue cause to other men
not to trust any Spaniard hereafter, with their bodies or goods upon these
causes. My Lord in that I judge this dishonourable act to be against your
honour and pleasure, (as I understand by your last Letters that came into
Ireland) considering the harme that might ensue to the service of your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jestie,
and the ever lasting overthrow that might happen to mee, and my poore
people, such as might escape the sword of our Enemy (if any should) I haue
taken upon mee (with the helpe of God) to offer to keepe my Castle and Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
from the hands of mine Enemies, untill further newes, and order come
from your Highnesse: I haue sent my Sonne and Heire (being of the age of
fiue yeares) as a Pledge for accomplishing your will in this behalfe, and for
the performing of my promise past unto your Greatnesse: I would not omit
my selfe in person to come and visit your Highnesse, but that I feare our
warres here would grow weake in respect of my absence, for which cause my
selfe, and the rest of our men of worth haue sent in haste with Intelligence

voluntarily by the owners unto you, and the Veador to the King

               <p>It was first much doubted and feared, that the Castle of Dunboy
had beene voluntarily, not without the privitie and consent of the
chiefe Commanders amongst the Spaniards, delivered unto <hi>Donnell
Osulevan,</hi> there being such an excellent Haven for the Kings ships, if
hee should send forces to repaire the ruines of his honour, so much
shaken by the former proceedings; but afterward understanding
that the Castle was not surprised without some blood, and also in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercepting
those Letters which verified the contrary, it cleered the
Spaniards of that suspition; but howsoever, the holding of this
Castle gaue occasion to the countrey more obstinately to stand out in
the action, because <hi>Osulevan Beare</hi> (for defence hereof) against the
English, had according to the contents of these Letters, entertayned
<hi>Tirrell, William Burke,</hi> and others with one thousand Bonnoghs,
which were by course employed about the fortifying of this Castle.

called the Durses, which is very strongly seated by nature, by reason
of the difficulty of landing (which is conveniently) but in one nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row

it is impossible for any Boat to arriue at this enterance, except
it bee in a dead calme, the least gale of wind, raising such billowes, as
doe endanger any Boat as shall come neere the shore: this impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable

bee wonne by the English; and therefore the custody thereof was
committed to <hi>Conner Odrischall,</hi> Sonne and Heire to Sir <hi>Finnin</hi> before
mentioned, who procuring three Peeces of Spanish Ordnance to be
convayed into the Iland, with certaine quantity of powder and shot,

against the most potent Enemy; but wee leaue these Rebels busying

man of great humanity, and a good statesman, able to relate many
things, both concerning the State of England, and particularly of
the Nobility in the same, as well as some that had spent their whole
liues in that Realme; but the end of all his conference, still tended
towards a peace betweene our Soveraigne and his Master, whereby
it may bee gathered, that the King of Spaine was weary of the
warre, which himselfe had injuriously begun: The substance of
their discourse Captaine <hi>Harvie</hi> related to the President, and also
shewed him a Pasport of the Veadors, and a Letter which hee sent
unto him after his arrivall in Spaine, all which are thus Englished.</p>

of his comming hither was such, as for the publike good hee
was enforced unto it, besides her Majesties opinion of his experience
is such, as shee knew he was able to end all the warres in these parts
with Expedition, which in foure Moneths my selfe can testifie hee

Before the comming of these Castillians, the Province (as you
haue heard) was in so good conformity, as the civill Iustice (without
all contradiction) had as currant passage as in any of the former yeares
of Peace, and every mans cattell (without losse or danger) lay day
and night in the fields: But now the Rebells, and their hyred Bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noghs
swarmed every where, and especially in Carbery, Beare, Des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond,

Oneale</hi> doth make warre for the Defence of the Catholique faith
with the Queene of <hi>England,</hi> and the English people; that is to
say, that it may be lawfull for him, and the Irish freely to professe the
Catho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>que Religion, which libertie the Queene of <hi>England</hi> doth
endeavour to take from them by force and Armes. There are two
matters now in question about this warre: The one is, whether it
bee lawfull for the Irish Catholiques to favour the foresaid Prince
<hi>Hugh</hi> with Armes, and all other meanes in this warre: The other
is, whether it bee lawfull for the same Catholiques, to fight against
the foresaid Prince, without deadly sin, and to favour the English
in this warre, either with Armes, or by any other meanes, especially
when as if they deny this kinde of helpe unto the English, they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
themselues to a manifest danger of their life, or of loosing all
their temporall goods: And furthermore, since it is permitted by the
Pope, that the Irish Catholiques may obey the foresayd Queene of
<hi>England,</hi> and acknowledge her as their lawfull Queene, by paying
tribute unto her; for it seemeth that what belongeth unto Subjects
to doe, may be performed, that is to say, to fight against the Queenes
Rebells, which deny their due obedience to her, and seeme to usurpe
the Land which is subject to her Dominion.</p>
               <p>That both these questions may be decided, wee must hold it as for
certaine, that the Romish Bishop hath power to bridle and suppresse,
such as forsake the faith, and those which oppose themselues with
Armes against the Catholike faith, when other meanes is not mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred
to overthrow so great an evill: And further it must bee conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
for infallible, that the Queene of England doth oppugne the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike
Religion, neither doth permit the Irish publikely to embrace
the Catholike faith, and that for the same cause, the foresaid Prince
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:18000:174"/>
and others before him, of whom the Letters Apostolicall of <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>lement</hi>
the eighth make mention, did make warre against her<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> These being
thus set downe, the first question is easily resolved, for it is qustion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse,
that any Catholikes whatsoever, may favour the said Prince,
<hi>Hughe Oneale,</hi> in the foresaid warre, and the same with great merit,
and hope of most great and eternall reward; for seeing that the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said
Prince, doth make warre by the authority of the high Bishop,
for the defence of Catholike religion, and that the Pope doth exhort
all the faithfull by his Letters thereto (as by his Letters is manifest)
and that hee will extend his graces upon the Favourers of the Prince
in that warre, in as ample manner, as if they did make warre against
the Turkes, no man will in equity doubt, but that both the present
warre is just, and that to fight for defence of the Catholike religion,
(which is the greatest thing of all) is a matter of great merit: And
concerning the second question, it is most certaine, that all those Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholikes
doe sinne mortally, which doe follow the English Standard
against the foresaid Prince, neither can they obtaine eternall salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
nor bee absolved of their sinnes by any Priest, except they first
repent and forsake the English Army, and the same is to be censured,
of those which in this warre favour the English, either with Armes
or Victuals, or giue them any thing of like condition, besides those
accustomed tributes which it is lawfull for them by vertue of the
Popes indulgence and permission, to pay unto the Kings of England,
or their officers, (so long as Catholike religion shall flourish in the
same.) This assertion is confirmed by this most manifest reason, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it is sufficiently proved by the Letters of the high Bishop, that
the English make unjust warre against the said <hi>Oneale,</hi> and those that
favour him: For seeing that the Pope doth declare, that the English
doe fight against the Catholike Religion, and that they should bee
resisted, as much as if they were Turkes, and that hee doth bestow
the same graces upon those which doe resist them; who doubteth
the warre which the English make against the Catholike Army to be
altogether unjust? But it is not lawfull for any to favour an unjust
warre, or to be present thereat under the paine of eternall damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
The Catholikes doe therefore most grievously offend, which
doe beare Armes in the Campes of Heretikes, against the foresaid
Prince, in a warre so apparantly impious and unjust, and all those
which doe assist the said warre, with Armes, Victuals, or by any
other meanes, which of themselues doe further the proceedings of
the warre, and cannot giue account of their indifferent obedience,
neither doth it any thing availe them to scandall the Apostolicall Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of <hi>Surreption,</hi> for <hi>Surreption</hi> cannot happen where no petition of
them is declared, in whose favour they were dispatched. But the
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:18000:175"/>
high Bishop doth openly teach in those Letters, that hee and his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicessors,
had exhorted the Irish Princes, and all faithfull men, to
make that warre, and to provoke them the more thereto; hee doth
enrich them with great favours, and indulgences: How may it then
bee, that those Letters were surreptiue, which only containe in them
an exhortation, strengthned with many great favours, for such as did
fulfill them; neither therefore can the Catholikes which assist the
English, defend themselues by the reasons alleaged in the second
question, for no mortall sinne is to bee committed; although either
life or goods stand thereupon: but those things which further and
helpe to execute an unjust warre are manifestly deadly sinnes. It is
permitted likewise to the Catholikes, to performe such kind of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
to the Queene, as doth not oppugne Catholike religion, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ever was, or could it bee the meaning of the Pope, to allow
them to use that obedience towards the Queene, which doth mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festly
disagree with the end and scope, which hee had to spread the
Catholike faith, and religion in Ireland; but that it was his meaning
and scope, his Letters doe manifestly declare. By all which it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayneth
sufficiently apparant, that the most famous Prince <hi>Hugh
Oneale,</hi> and other Catholikes of Ireland, making warre against an
hereticall Queene, who opposeth her selfe against the true faith, and
no Rebels at all, neither doe deny due obedience, nor vsurpe unjustly
the Queenes Dominions, but rather that they doe revenge themselues
and their Countrey, from impious and wicked tyrannie by a most
just warre, and defend and mainetaine the holy and right faith, with
all their power, as becommeth Catholikes and Christians. All and
every of which, wee underwritten, doe judge and approue, as most
certaine and true. <hi>Salamanca</hi> the seventh of March, 1602.</p>

him as Cannoniers: I now calling to mind his desire, (in the loue
I beare him, being so great a Captaine, and so honourable a Person

this Letter unto you, promising (for the reasons before mentioned)
that when I shall sit downe (with my forces) before the castle (where
you are) if then you will quitt the same and come unto mee, I will,
by the faith of a Gentleman, and a Christian, make good my promise
to <hi>Don Iuan de Aguila;</hi> not onely to secure you in comming to me,
and in the like safetie to bee with mee, but also to relieue and supply
your wants, and likewise at your pleasure, to accommodate you
with a Ship, and my Pasport, safely to passe into <hi>Spaine,</hi> in such man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner

finde or receiue further favours at my hands, you may with facilitie
deserue it, that is, when you leaue the Castle to cloy the Ordnance,

or mayme their Carriages, that when they shall haue need of them,
they may prooue uselesse, for the which I will forthwith liberally
recompense you answerable to the qualitie of your merit. Lastly, if
there bee in your companies any strangers, (English and Irish excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted)
which are likewise by force held (as you are) these my letters shall
be sufficient to secure their repaire to me, and also to depart, as hath
beene before mentioned, conditionally, that you and they present
your selues unto mee, before our Ordnance shall begin to batter the
Castle of Donboy aforesayd: But if on your part default be made,
I holde my selfe clearely acquitted of my promise made to <hi>Don Iohn,</hi>

to speake with him, I am uncertaine, but of this I am sure, that the
Earles meeting with him, was not without the Presidents know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
and allowance: All the Eloquence and artifice which the
Earle could use avayled nothing; for <hi>Mac Goghagan</hi> was resolved to
persevere in his wayes, and in the great loue which he pretended to
beare unto the Earle, hee advised him not to hazard his life, in lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
upon the Mayne: for I know (sayd hee) you must land at yon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Sandy Bay, where before your comming, the place will bee so
trenched and gabioned, as you must runne upon assured death:
The Earle disdayning both his obstinacie, and his vaine-glorious
advice, brake off speech, telling <hi>Mac Goghagan,</hi> that ere many
dayes passed, hee would repent that hee had not followed his
counsell.</p>
               <p>The sixth<note place="margin">6. Iune.</note> being Sunday, a foule and stormie morning, the Lord
President very early taking but one Footman with him, rode two or
three miles from the Campe,<note place="margin">The L. Presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent rode to view the place where the forces w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

to passe the Army (which that day was to rise) over into the
Maine: The cause which moved him to be stirring so timely, was to
view the landing place, which was lesse then halfe a mile from the
place of the embarquing, from whence hee might easily discerne a
low sandy Bay, betweene high ground, of a very little capacitie,
where the discent was to bee made, which was entrenched and bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricad<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

with gabions of earth; in the which trench and behind the
gabions, the enemies had placed there Muskettiers, and their grosse
at hand, to giue them seconds: But not contented with a view so
farre off, the Queenes Pinnace the Merlin, riding not farre from
him, hee commanded Captaine <hi>Flemming</hi> to passe him over into a
little Iland, called <hi>Donghe Irish,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Donghe Irish.</note> which lay betweene the great Iland
and the Maine, and some part of it not twelue score from the sandy
Bay aforesaid: When hee came into the said Iland, and taking an
exact view of the landing place, and how the rebels Army lodged to
forbid our descent, and the apparant danger hee saw would ensue in
the attempt, hee rounded all the small Iland, and at last hee found a
convenient place to land in the Maine<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the same (by reason of a
rising ground in the middest thereof) was out of the sight of the san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
Bay:<note place="margin">The vigilant care of the Lord Presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent.</note> presently hee commanded Captaine <hi>Fleming</hi> to land (out of

their trunks to a place naturally formed like a platforme, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rapetted
with an old ditch, as if it had beene fashioned to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose:
In this place the Peeces were planted; from it to the Maine
land, it was not aboue one hundred paces; and although the distance
from the sandy Bay to this place, was not foure and twenty score, yet
to come unto it was more then halfe a mile, by reason of a Gurt, or
cleft Rock, made by the Sea; which ran up farre into the land, which
the Enemy must compasse before hee could come unto it: By that
time that the President had performed as much as hee intended in the
small Iland,<note place="margin">Two Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts landed in the little Iland.</note> the Presidents and the Earle of Thomonds regiments
were embarqued, and under saile, whom the President (when they
came neere unto him) caused to land where hee stood in the small
Iland, and drawing them to that end of the same which faced the
sandy Bay to amuse the rebels, being not distant from them (as is said)
a Musket shot, hee formed them into a battallion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and so stood firme
confronting the Enemy, as if from thence hee would passe them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Maine: Sir <hi>Richard Percy,</hi> and Sir <hi>Charles Wilmot</hi> with the
reare Regiments (by this time) were likewise embarqued.</p>

small Iland, but in steed of landing in the same, the President directed
them to passe by the end of it (when hee had placed the faulcons) and
to land directly in the Maine; before the Rebels found themselues
deceived, the two reare Regiments were landed, and formed into
order ready to fight;<note place="margin">The Rebels deceived.</note> then the President drew his owne, and the Earle
of <hi>Thomonds</hi> regiments to the boats, not twelue score from them,
which the Rebels preceiving, and too late finding their error, in a
disordered manner made towards our landing place, but before they
could compasse the fret, or cleft rocky ground as aforesaid, all our
Army was landed: Neverthelesse they came on brauely, but our
falcons made them hault; our Vanguard made towards them, and a
good skirmish ensued, which continued untill the other Regiments
came up, but then they brake, and ran faster then wee could follow:

were officers, and thirtie wounded, whereof Captaine <hi>Tirrell</hi> was

the Castle, untill they were within that Creeke, whose mouth was
not aboue fortie yards distant from the Castle: The President com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
the Ordnance to bee shipped into Boats, and to carry them
into that Creeke, which by the helpe of darke nights, and still row<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
was effected undiscovered: But the Cannon and Culverings
were of that weight, that no Boat there could carry them, and none
durst adventure in the Hoy to carry them by night. In this difficulty
Captaine <hi>Slingsby</hi> did desire the President, that hee would commit
that to his charge, and giue him but thirtie Shott, and he would (by
Gods grace) carry that Ordnance by day light into that Creeke, or
sinke by the way, if his Lordship would please to adventure the
Ordnance; which was accepted and performed the same day with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the losse of any man, though many shot were made from the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle:
for hee had placed all his Shot in the hold upon the Ballast, so
that the Decke was breast high aboue them, so that they had
onely their Peeces and head and shoulders aboue the decke, to play
with their small shot, and he that steered the Hoy, might bee in safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
(which much concerned the effecting of that service by his safe
conducting) hee placed him in the hold, and ordered it so, that with
two takles bee might steere the Hoy either to Starboard, or to Port,
as hee was willed aboue by the Captaine, who stood aloft by the
Misen Maste to order her course as he saw cause: but it was so fine
and fresh a gale of winde, that though they sayled aboue halfe a
league in play of the Ordnance and small shot of the Castle, yet shee
made that way, that they could not aboue twice discharge and lade
their Ordnance, before shee attained the Creeke, where she was then
in securitie from any further annoyance of the Castle.</p>

Also this day a whole Culvering was drawne out of the Campe, and

part of the Castle, of the hight of sixteene foote, as in like manner
all the Turrets and Curtains of the Barbicon were reinforced, at the
top whereof they barricadoed themselues with barrels of earth, and
at the first approach there was within it, some of the Enemy with
a Faulcon of Iron, whom our men forced to quit the place, and to

which was rampiered with earth some sixteene foote high; flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
the first, it being well manned, and therein a Demy Culvering
and a Saker of brasse, loaden with haile shot; the one whereof they
presently discharged upon our men that were possest of the South-west
Turret and Spurre, and going to lade her againe, their Gunner
was slaine at his Peece; whereupon they being for the present depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
of the use of those Ordnance, and the place wee possest playing
directly into it, they were forced to retreate under the safetie of the
East part of the Castle, which was standing, where the Enemy had
placed Pikes at the corners of the wals, to receiue them; (the way
betweene it, and the Curtaine of the Barbicon, being but sixe or
eight foote broad, which passage they so well defended, as we could
neither annoy them, nor goe betwixt the two Turrets aforesaid,

shelter of the wall, and the narrownesse of the passage deprived both
us and them of all use of shot, and there for the space of an hower

not defend themselves, or give any great annoyance to the Spaniard,

Seconds and succours, were unavoydably left to ruine: And besides
(though the Spaniards came not) the service that they could doe in
that Countrey, would not countervaile Her Majesties charge in

hee pretended, to become a Subject upon these conditions: First, if
his brother <hi>Iames</hi> (the titulary Earle) might bee set at libertie, hee
would bee content to become a Pledge for him, either in the Castle
of Dublin, or else where the State should appoynt; which being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused
and rejected, hee offered to doe service, so that hee might haue
his pardon, and some meanes to releeue him in the future: But as
the President would not bee drawen to accept any of these conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
so it was thought hee would haue flyen backe if they had been
accepted: But all this Negotiation was but to colour his practise
laid for Glancoyne, which Castle and the Fastnesse neere adjoyning
would haue commaunded a great part of that Countrey. But all
these Iuglings were discovered by one <hi>V. B.</hi> whom the President
without suspition maintained amongst them: Wherefore hee sent
<hi>Philip Northcot,</hi> the Sherife of the Countie of Limericke, with pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate

Castle, but either to take both (at one instant) or to meddle with

the custodie of the said Castle to Sir <hi>Francis Barkley,</hi> and so

were discryed being a Fleet of Easterlings bound to the Southward.
The President heereby discerning with what assured hopes they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended
their comming, and with what glad hearts they should be
welcome, (being come) he became an earnest &amp; humble suitor to the

last arrivall out of Spaine, and that from him hee had received eight
hundred duckets impresse, and thereupon had accorded to yeeld into
the Spaniards hands (immediatly upon their landing) his strong Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
of the Blarny, situate within two miles of Corke, which deposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
was afterwards confirmed by the testimony and evidence of
sundry other credible personages: these informations concurring
with the examinations o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<hi>Don Dermutio</hi> (executed at Corke, of whom before you haue
heard) and also manyfold proofes, existing of his often combination
with <hi>Tyrone, Odonnell, Florence Mac Cartie,</hi> and <hi>Iames fits Thomas,</hi>
with other triviall treasons, ordinary amongst these Provincials:
The President with the advice of the Provinciall Councell, thought
it a matter of very dangerous consequence, to permit such grosse and
palpable treasons to escape unpunished, the tolleration whereof
might breed such intollerable boldnesse in these people, that her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties
politicke government, and authority temporall, would grow
no lesse contemptible then the Ecclesiasticke; against the which the
best seeming Subjects were refractory; to prevent therefore such fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
mischiefe as might ensue by longer protraction, it was thought
fit, that during the time of these Sessions (then in hand) the said <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mock</hi>
                  <pb n="332" facs="tcp:18000:205"/>
should bee apprehended, and committed to safe custody, untill
such time as the originall and depth of his offences (being found out)
hee might bee brought to his triall, according to due course in Law:
the day and time therefore being appoynted for his commitment,
which was about the eighteenth of August,<note place="margin">18. August.</note> the President the same
morning (to avoyd all suspition, tooke a journey to Kinsale, to view
the fortifications in Castle ny Parke, leaving behind him double di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections
concerning <hi>Cormock;</hi> first for his Castle of Blarney, which
is one of the largest and strongest Castles within the Province of
Mounster, for it is fower piles joyned in one, seated upon a maine
Rock, so as it is free from myning, the wall eighteene foote thicke,
and well flancked, at each corner to the best advantage: considering
therefore the difficulty that might grow in taking this Castle by
force, the President gaue direction to Sir <hi>Charles Wilmot,</hi> and Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
<hi>Roger Harvie</hi> (taking for their guard a Sergeant with foure and
twenty foote) to make shew of going only to hunt the Bucke in the
parts neere adjoyning, and beeing hot and weary, betweene the
houres of ten and eleven of the clock in the forenoone, to take the
said Castle in their way homeward, and calling for wine and vsque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bagh
(whereof Irish Gentlemen are seldome disfurnished) should
(if it were possible) themselues first, and their Souldiers afterward
draw into the Castle, and gaine possession thereof; and the chiefe
Iustice <hi>Saxey</hi> likewise had direction to call <hi>Cormock</hi> before him in the
publicke Sessions; and taking occasion of defect and delay, about
certaine prisoners, whom hee should haue forth comming at these
Assises, should at the same hower (before appoynted) commit him
to the Gentleman Porter, till the Presidents pleasure should be farther
knowen at his returne from Kinsale: this later order concerning
his person was accordingly effected, but the former stratageme about
the Castle was frustrated; for the Warders, whether out of the jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
custome of the Nation in generall (which is not to admit any
strangers in their masters absence to come into their Castles,<note place="margin">Cormock Mac Der<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to prison.</note>) or
whether <hi>Cormock</hi> in his guiltinesse had given them such directions,
I know not, but sure I am that neither Sir <hi>Charles,</hi> though hee much
importuned to see the roomes within) nor any of his company were
permitted to goe into the Gate of the Castle, nor hardly to looke
within the gate of the Bawne: The President was no sooner retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to Corke, but one of <hi>Cormocks</hi> Followers, saluted him with a
Petition, relating at large the hard measure that his Master had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
from the chiefe Iustice, to whom answer was made, that hee
would call for the chiefe Iustice before him, and being satisfied from
him of all particulars, order should bee taken that no unjust, nor si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister
proceedings should be taken against him; in the meane time
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:18000:205"/>
hee must be content to submit himselfe, and be menable unto Law:
Now did the time better permit the offences formerly committed, to
be pursued by course of Iustice, for could he but haue gathered by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable
conjecture, of the discovery of any part of these treacheries
(before his apprehension) he had in readinesse one thousand men of
his owne Followers) well armed to haue stept with him into action
upon the first alarme.</p>
               <p>The combination lately by <hi>Cormocke</hi> contracted with the Priest
<hi>Owen Mac Eggan,</hi> being manifestly prooved by severall witnesses,
subject to no Exceptions, the Gentleman Porter, (called Master <hi>Raph

making his apparance, was charged with the severall Treasons a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
recited, who insisted very much upon his Iustification, preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
that those accusations were injuriously devised, and slanderous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
suggested by his Enemies, especially for the last Article concerning
the Conspiracie with the Priest <hi>Mac Eggan,</hi> (which indeed was so
cunningly and secretly caryed, as he supposed, that it was rather presu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
then prooved against him; Hee renounced all favour and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,
if it would bee justified by lawfull testimony. The President
replyed, that this was the onely matter of substance that he was char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
withall, the former being pardoned since the perpetrating there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
being onely inducements and presumptions whereby they were

But hee still persisting in his Innocencie, was at last urged with this
<hi>Dilemma,</hi> namely, that either hee should confesse his fault, and so
intreat her Majesties mercy, or else in token of his loyall and guilt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
heart, he should deliver unto the State his Castle of <hi>Blarney,</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
condition, that if the fact whereof he was charged, were not evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
prooved against him, the sayd Castle should be redelivered to
him or his assignes by a day appoynted. At first hee seemed very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinable
to the motion, but in processe it was perceived that hee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
nothing but jugling and devices; wherefore a Warrant from
the whole Body of the Councell, was directed to the sayd Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Porter, straightly charging and commanding that he should be
kept in yrons closer then before, untill he should demeane himselfe
in more dutifull conformitie; And besides, they appoynted Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
<hi>Taffe,</hi> (in whom <hi>Cormock</hi> reposed much trust) to perswade him
to surrender the sayd Castle into the Presidents hands, undertaking
upon his credit, to retaine the same, and all the goods in it, or neere
thereunto, belonging either to himselfe or his followers, from losse
and danger, either by Subject or Rebell. <hi>Cormocke</hi> at last finding
that the President was resolved either to make him bend or breake,
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:18000:206"/>
caused his Constable, (though much against his will) to yeeld the
said Castle to Captaine <hi>Taffe,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Castle of Blarney in the custo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

haue the charge or custodie thereof. The Prisoner besides the Castle
of <hi>Blarney,</hi> had two places (kept by his Dependants) of good im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance
to commaund the Countrey; the one an Abbey called Kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crey,
distant from Corke sixe myles, and the other a Castle called
Mocrumpe, sixteene miles distant from Corke; the former scituated
upon the South, and the latter upon the North side of the River of
Lee. The Castle and Abbey of Kilcrey<note place="margin">The Castle and Abbey of Kilcrey rendred to the Lo. Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sident, but the Castle of Mocrumpe was detayned from him.</note> was rendred to Captaine
<hi>Francis Slingsbie,</hi> sent thither by the President; But Mocrumpe sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in the heart of Muskrey, and invironed round about with woods
and bogges, could not be gotten without the countenance of an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie;
therefore the President sent first Captaine <hi>Flower,</hi> and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
Sir <hi>Charles Wilmott,</hi> with competent numbers of Foot and
Horse to lye before it, untill such time as they might gaine it by Sapp
or Myne,<note place="margin">Mocrumpe besieged.</note> or by some other stratageme, as time and occasion should
minister opportunity. During this siege the President cast about
for his wife and children,<note place="margin">Cormocks wife &amp; chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soned.</note> and having gotten them likewise into his
hands, confined them within the walles of Corke. These things
thus accomplished, the President dispatched Letters both to the
Lords of her Majesties Privie Councell of <hi>England,</hi> and also to the
Lord Deputie and Councell of <hi>Ireland,</hi> relating unto them the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension
of <hi>Cormocke,</hi> and the reasons inducing him thereunto,
desiring also to receiue their Lordships pleasures for his further pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings
in this businesse; but before answere could bee returned,
an unfortunate accident unexpected altered the whole platforme of
this intended service: For <hi>Cormocks</hi> followers had plotted his escape,
and likewise to procure <hi>Cormock Oge</hi> his eldest sonne,<note place="margin">Cormock Mac Der<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond plot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his escape.</note> (who was
then a Student in Oxford) to bee convayed secretly out of the Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versitie,
and to be brought into <hi>Ireland,</hi> or as some thought to bee
sent into <hi>Spaine;</hi> for effecting whereof, <hi>Iohn O Healy,</hi> one of <hi>Cormocks</hi>
old theeues, was (the next passage) to be sent into <hi>England:</hi> Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisement
hereof was brought to the President, who for preventing
of both these Designes, first sent for the Gentleman Porter, delivered
unto him at large the great prejudice that should arise to her Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties
Service, if the prisoner should escape, that the Queenes charge,
and his owne paines and laborious travell, were all frustrated: yea if
the Spaniards should arriue (as they were expe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>ed) the whole king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of Ireland should receiue hazard and prejudice by it: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he charged him upon his duty to the State, his allegeance to her
Majestie, and in the loue he bare unto himselfe, that hee would bee
no lesse carefull of his safe keeping, then of his owne life, which
in some sort depended thereon: Answer was made by <hi>Hammon,</hi> that
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:18000:206"/>
his Lordship should not need to trouble his minde with any such
imaginary doubts: for if shackles of yron, walles of stone, and
force of men, (for hee had certaine Souldiers allowed him for a
Guard) could make him sure, then should the Prisoner bee forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comming,
whensoever the State should bee pleased to call for him,
and for <hi>Iohn O Healy,</hi> the President held a watchfull eye over him
but it was not thought good to make stay of him untill he should be
aboard the ship, that such Instructions and Letters as should bee sent
by him, might with himselfe bee apprehended, whereby the whole
circumstance of these plots, and the chiefe Agents therein might bee
discovered: to make short, the wind was faire, the Master hasteth
aboard, the Marriners and Passengers purposing to set saile the next
tyde; amongst the rest <hi>Iohn O Healy</hi> unregarded (as hee thought) is
also on shipboard, but hee was much deceived in his opinion, for
presently a Messenger sent from the State, found him in the hold;
when he began to search him for his Letters, he making shew to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver
them willingly (upon a suddaine) threw both his Letters and
money into the Sea; which although it did plainely demonstrate
apparant guiltinesse, yet could hee never afterwards bee wrought to
confesse either the contents of the one, or the summe of the other,
pretending ignorance in both, whereupon hee was committed to
the common Goale.</p>
               <p>But let us leaue <hi>Cormock</hi> for a while with the Gentleman Porter,

to our dueties) imparted to her Majestie your dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch
of the seven and twentieth of Iuly, who hath concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
so great liking of your proceedings, as she hath comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
us to take notice of the same, in the most gratious tearmes
that our owne heart could wish, being likewise most desirous that the Army
(under you) as well in generall, as those Gentlemen and Officers in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,
who haue so valiantly exposed themselues to danger (as appeareth by
your particular relation) may know, that they haue ventured their liues for a
Prince, who holdeth them so deare, as if shee could preserue her estate and
them, without the losse and hazard of them, there is nothing which she pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sesseth
(of her owne) which she would spare to redeeme their trouble and
danger. It remayneth now that wee acquaint what is done by her Majestie,
to prevent the purposes of the King of Spaine, wherein wee cannot but
much commend the apprehension you take of those advertisements you haue,
and the judgement you use in applying the same, for the safetie of that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince,
the defection whereof, as wee are sorry to find by so understanding
a person as you are: So doe wee hope when it shall appeare (as it doth daily
in all parts of Ireland) that God doth blesse her Majesties Army against the
Rebels, and that the King of Spaine shall find himselfe not so at ease, as to
employ any Army there in haste, that, that lacke of duety and ingratitude
(which doth now liue in them) will either dye in it selfe, and turne to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
or else that God will (as hee hath begun) confound them in their owne
malitious inventions: It is very true, that her Majesties owne advertise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
doe confirme, that a Pinnace of fiftie Tunne, was sent with some of
<hi>Odonnels</hi> Followers, and some tr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>asure, to assure the Rebels of an Army to
come into Ireland, which Pinnace being once put to Sea, was forced backe
againe to Vinera, but they parted thence againe within three or fower dayes
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:18000:207"/>
after, which is the same that landed at Ardea, whereof your Letters make
mention: Wee haue also assured advertisements that her Majesties fleete,
(being kept on the Coast) hath much hindered the Spanish de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ignes, not that
they were fully ready to come forth, but because the fleete kept their prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
from drawing to a head, for this next moneth is the time, which is the fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
for them to put to Sea, if her Majesties fleete doe not hinder them: For
which purpose, though now most of her ships (being long at Sea, and come in
with the carrick, yet they are going out againe with all possible speed. You shall
further understand, that her Majestie hath beene acquainted of the Letters
of complements, betweene <hi>Don Iohn</hi> and you, the Copies being sent over by
the Deputie, by Sir <hi>Oliver Saint-Iohn,</hi> whereof you now send the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall.
At which time, hee sent her Majestie his owne and kept no counsell,

which Passeport also proceeded) her Majesty conceiveth that you may make
some good use for her service, in this forme following: Where it doth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare
by <hi>Odonnels</hi> Letter to <hi>O Connor Kerry</hi> out of Spaine, that hee is
desirous to understand the State of Ireland; but so as if thee bee any bad,
it may bee concealed from the Spaniards; Captaine <hi>Harvie</hi> may in requitall
of the Veadors curtesie towards him use this freedome (of a Gentleman)
though an enemy, to let him see how much the King of Spaine is abused by the
Rebels, who seeke to engage him upon false hopes, and conceale just causes of
doubts, for which purpose hee shall send him <hi>Odonnels</hi> owne Letter, which
hee cannot deny, and withall in any case (it being well over<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>eene by you) make
him a relation of the successes of her Majesties Army; now if it may bee
said, that they will thinke this Letter is aposted, and take this to be a finenesse
in <hi>Harvie;</hi> the worst that can come, is, that this good may ensue: That un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
colour of sending that to him, there may some person goe in the ship, who
may discover what preparations there is in that place; for the better colouring
whereof, hee may reply, that where hee hath sent him a Passeport for the safe
conduct of any person whatsoever, hee should send to negotiate in the matter
(which passed betweene them in conference) that he looked rather to haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
from him, (who was the Propounder of the same) with so great
affection, some such overture from that side, as might haue given him founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to breake with the Deputy, or your selfe, to send over to her Majesty
about it, for which purpose he may offer him, as good a Passeport for any of
his Messengers, as he hath sent to himselfe, it being very great reason that
such a motion should prooceed from that side rather, which hath opened it
selfe with greatest violence, then from any of her Majesties ministers,
who haue in steed of their malitious attempt, performed all offices of honour
and humanity. And so much for answer of that poynt.</p>
                     <p>For your opinion concerning such places as are fit to bee fortified, her
Majestie doeth very well approoue the reasous whereupon the same is
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:18000:208"/>
grounded, being such indeed as ought to sway her Maiesties Iudgements
either one way or other; for as it is true, that charge is well forborne which
draweth with it perill, so it is a double danger to spend in any place, where
safetie followeth not such a charge: And therefore if you doe continue in the
minde, that Baltimore is like to bee of greatest use to the Enemie, both in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
of the Haven it selfe, and of the Countrey adjoyning, and that some
such Fortification may bee raysed as may commaund the Haven, without any
great charge, her Maiestie is content that you doe proceed; Otherwise if
you doe thinke that whensoever any forces shall descend, that the place so for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified
cannot hold out for any time, then her Maiestie doeth like it better,
both there and elsewhere, that those Castles which you doe winne from the
Irish, seated upon the Sea, bee utterly demolished, rather then to bee left for
the Rebells to nestle in at their first arrivall, and easier to be furnished by
them for their great advantage. In which poynt of Fortifications, because
you may <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ee the temper of her Maiesties mind, that useth meane in all things,
and knoweth when to spend, and when to spare, in both which never Prince
was so little subiect to private <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>umour, either one way or other, further then
stood with the safetie of her state and people, over which her care is rather to
bee admired then matched: Wee doe send you an extract of her owne Letter
to the Lord Deputie, how hee should governe himselfe in that poynt, whereof
wee feare you haue not yet had notice, in respect that the distance betweene
you and him, is well neere the longitude of Ireland. For the Artillery
which you haue taken, if you finde them necessarie for that Kingdome, shee is
well pleased that they bee detayned, as well to serue for a scourge to them that
brought them, (if againe they renew their attempt) as to prevent the incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencie
and charge of their transportation hither<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But if you finde them
not necessary for that place, but that Iron may doe as good service, you may
transport them in some of the Victuallers, when they doe returne from that

                     <p>SIr, after your departure it pleased God to visit mee with such ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame
sicknesse, as all my thoughts were fixed upon another
life, supposing that my dayes had beene determined: By reason
whereof, together with my feeblenesse and absence, I had not the
meanes to acquaint the Lord President, with the passages betwixt us
untill now, that the time prefixed in your Passeport is almost expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
which I could not by any meanes remedy: Sir I haue of late re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
a Letter from you, dated the ninth of Aprill, 1602. by the
which I perceiue, that you are desirous that I should send a Messenger,
to giue you a taste (as I conceiue) concerning the discourse which
passed betweene us, which truely I would willingly haue done, if I
had not beene visited with sicknesse: But now finding by the opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of all men, that his Majestie is resolved to continue the warre
against the Sacred person of my Soveraigne: Although in my heart
(as a Christian) I wish a firme vnity betweene their Majesties, the
which by their Ancestors hath beene so long time (to the comfort of
their Subjects) religiously continued: Yet now understanding of
the great preparations which the King is in making, for the invasion
of her Majesties Dominions: I confesse I am not so passionate for
the peace as I was, and I haue no reason to make any overture of your
discourse to the Lord President, there being so little probability of a
peace to ensue: Wherefore if you thinke it good, that the matter we
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:18000:209"/>
speake of, should be set on foote, because you were the first mover of
it (wherein you manifest your zeale) I pray you to write unto mee,
that I may understand, whether his Majestie will giue eare to a peace
or no, whereof you need not be scrupulous to speake freely, since you
see by experience, that when your designe did giue us cause of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge,
we did intreat you with honour and humanity: when I shall
know your answer, I will deale effect<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

with whom aswell in kindred as in affection, I haue such interest as
you haue heard, and of whose worth and sufficiencie you haue bin
well informed, assuring you that if hee will put his hand unto it, it
will much advance the busines: I am not in despaire of his inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to a peace, if by your answer hee may perceiue, that you proceed
roundly: I marvell much that his Majestie and the Lords of his
Councell, lends their eares so much unto this traitorly barbarous na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
who from their Cradles haue beene nourished in falsehood and
treasons, masking (of late) their actions under the vaile of religion,
whereof the truth is, that in their hearts they haue neither feare of
God, nor faith to men: And that from henceforth you may not bee
blinded, and see their fraud, wherewith they beguile his Majestie,
unto whom they protest sincerity. I doe send you here inclosed a
Letter signed by the hand of the Traytor <hi>Odonnell,</hi> written to a friend
of his in this Province of Mounster, called <hi>O Connor K<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

was found in the Castle of Beerehaven, the which by her Majesties
forces (under the conduct of the President in person) was within
the space of seven dayes taken and razed, and the Rebels put to the
sword, their Companions with all their forces lodging neere unto
them, but (according to their custome) they durst not second nor aid
them, but left them to destruction: By the which Letter you shall
see (as cleere as the day) how this Traytor <hi>Odonnell</hi> onely tempers a

who doe but temporize to worke their advantage by it: To re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late

to bee received into the favour and mercy of our Soveraigne, and
that all the Lords and Chiefs of the North that followed him on the
day of the rowt at Kinsale, and others of those parts haue submitted
themselues to the Lord Deputie, and for securitie haue put in their
Pledges for their future loyalties: And <hi>Tirone</hi> (with his weake
Troupes) haue beene so sharply prosecuted, that as a fugitiue (being
enforced to quit his owne Countrey) hee seekes out Coverts, Bogges,
and Woods; The Lord Deputie without impeachment passes from
place to place, and holds all Vlster in subjection: The other Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:18000:210"/>
of Leinster and Connaght, are reduced to obedience, and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
of Munster (where I remaine) is so much at the commandement
of the Lo. President, as if he would receiue to mercy all the Traytors
that seeke to bee received, and promise to liue as good subjects, there
would bee no rebels left; And amongst others, <hi>Osulevan,</hi> who hath
given you the best assurance, and of whom (as I think) you haue most
confidence, doth daily make suit to be restored to the Queens favour,
and this I assure you from the mouth of the Lo. President. Moreover
(as the vulgar can informe you) the President absolutely commands
in this Province, and the traitors (whose requests he rejects) are so few
and so weake, as they liue like unto wolues and foxes, flying from one
place to another, onely to assure their liues, which kind of life cannot
long endure. But if the King your Master will persevere to ayd these
poore traitors, you shall see us (when you shall enterprise it) in better
point then wee were, it not being in your power to surprise any Port
or place of importance; and if it be your chance to come hither in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
you shall find it to be true, whereof in my particular (in regard of
the honor I beare you) I should be exceeding sorry. The Bearer here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of

<hi>Pedro Enriques de Tejada,</hi> lately deceased, hath intreated the Lord
President to licence him to see his sonne, to the end that he might sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
his necessary wants, for default wherof he may otherwise perish;
which occasion I willingly embraced, whereby I might write unto
you, &amp; by that meanes receiue your answer, beseeching you to extend
your favour unto him, during his abode in <hi>Spaine,</hi> I will doe the like
for all such as depend upon you, if they shall happen to arriue in this
Kingdome. And to the end that I might the more fully know your
answere, and haue the better meanes to treat the more effectually in
these affayres, which are of such consequence, I pray you to send one
from you well instructed, that I may bring him to the Lo. President,
which will much advance the businesse you desire. And as you haue
given mee a Pasport for such as I should send unto you, (whereof by
reason of my sicknes I could make no use) I doe send you the like here
inclosed, which shalbe of force untill the end of <hi>February</hi> 1602: Even

                     <p>
                        <hi>MVy illustre Sennor,</hi> I doubt not but that your Lordship hath
received my Letters of the thirteenth of Iuly, sent in answer
of yours of the second of Aprill, by the Captaines <hi>Suaço</hi> and
<hi>Sigler,</hi> and I rest so well satisfied of the good tearmes, wherein wee
stand, as I am desirous to doe your Lordship some agreeable service;
at that time there was no occasion for mee to make use of the Passe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port,
and offer your Lordship made me, for security of that man or
ship which I should send into those parts: But now this bearer
Captaine <hi>Walter Edney,</hi> whose Sonne served Captaine <hi>Pedro Enriques
de Tejada</hi> (lately deceased) having prayed mee to giue him licence, and
my Passeport to see his Sonne: To supply him of his necessary
wants, I beseech your Lordship that he may (according to your pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise)
safely and securely passe and returne, which favour I shall thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
acknowledge: And whensoever your Lordship shall haue oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion,
to send any of yours into these parts, hee shall bee vsed with
the like courtesie: I haue received profit by the booke of fortification
which your Lordship left mee at your departure, and hold it as a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique
in memory of you, and as a good Scholler I haue put some
things in practise, whereof your Lordship at your returne hither
againe (which I hope in God will be never) may be a witnesse, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
I haue committed any error in the art o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

hath beene the want of the helpe of so great a Master as your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
is, of whom I am desirous to learne, not onely that art, but in all
else concerning military profession, in the which I doe giue your
Lordship the preheminence: To conclude, I rest in all I may (my
dutie reserved to the Queene my mistresse) affectionatly ready at your
Lordships service, and so kissing your hands. I beseech God to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue
you with many happy yeares:</p>

understood that <hi>Don Iohn de Aguila,</hi> by the accusation of the Irish
Fugitiues, was in disgrace confined to his house, where (of griefe)
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:18000:212"/>
shortly after hee dyed. His Letters and Pasports were taken from
him by the Earle of <hi>Carazena,</hi> and sent to the Court, and himselfe
stayed untill the Kings pleasure was knowen. The Irish Traytors
inveighed much against him, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and bringing of Presents, hee came as a Spie; Neverthelesse he was
well intreated, and had the libertie of the Towne, and to weare his
Sword, with allowance from the King of a Duccat <hi>per diem</hi> for his
dyet: His goods were solde for the best advantage, and his Barque

               <p>A little before this time Sir <hi>Robert Cecill,</hi>

branch of which hee also sent to the President<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> dated upon the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth
of <hi>August,</hi> and received the second of September, I hold meet
to insert, wherby the Reader may understand that the King of <hi>Spaine</hi>
had still his eyes open upon <hi>Ireland.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>One great cause of my writing this private Letter, is this, that
where I see how much it doth distract your mind to thinke of <hi>Spaine</hi>
behinde you, and of the North before you, fearing to bee diverted
from the conclusion of your labours, you may perceiue in what estate
the preparations of <hi>Spaine</hi> are now, as I am certainly advertised by
one of mine owne, who is newly arrived from the Port of Lisbone,
where he tooke shipping the 21 of <hi>Iuly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There are two great Ships, each of them of a thousand Tunnes,
one called the <hi>Andrew,</hi> &amp; the other (which shall be the Viceadmirall)
the name forgotten: Besides, there are twelue ships of two hundred
tunnes and downeward, in which it is resolved to send some fifteene
hundred men, to haue releeved the siege at Bearehaven<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Newes
of the taking whereof was first knowen by a Ship from Waterford
to Lisbon, and not before: Of the fifteene hundred men, eight hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
came from the Groyne, being part of those which were trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
out of <hi>Ireland.</hi> In the Groyne remaineth <hi>Odonnell,</hi> and there is
onely the great Saint <hi>Philip,</hi> with ten small Barques, with which he
mightily importuned to be sent to the North. If these had been sent
unto Beerehaven in Mounster, hoping upon his arrivall with some
fifteene hundred men, to haue raised the siege, possessed some parts,
and made a beginning of a plantation, heereof great benefit must
needs haue growen to the Rebels: for as those small numbers which
should haue been landed at Mounster, with the bruite of the rest to
follow, (which is alwayes multiplied) would haue made a distracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Vlster prosecution, &amp;c. Lastly, in the said Letter he prayed
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:18000:213"/>
the President to set downe his opinion, what course were best to be
taken in a Defensiue warre, if the King of <hi>Spaine</hi> did invade <hi>Ireland</hi>
with a Royall Armie. The next passage, to giue Master Secretarie
satisfaction, the Lord President wrote unto him a long Letter; but
because many private things were handled in the same, I will onely
relate so much of it, as concernes his opinion, touching a defensiue
warre in <hi>Ireland.</hi>

                     <head>The Lord Presidents Opinion sent to Master Secretary,
of a Defensiue Warre in Ireland.</head>
                     <p>GRanting that the Enemie will come no lesse powerfull then is
reported, and that the Irish will joyne with them (whereof
there is no doubt) then consideration is to bee had, what in such a
Sea of troubles, is meetest to bee done, that may best preserue the
Queenes army with lest charge, and the way to weary the enemy
and the countrey. Because my opinion may perchance differ from
other men, whose Authority, Greatnesse, and better iudgement
(in the worldes opinion) beares more sway, I will forbeare to deale
in so waightie a businesse any farther, then to your selfe, vsing the
libertie you haue euer giuen me, to say what I conceiue to be the best
Counsaile, if the army of <hi>Spaine</hi> be so great as is both reported by
those that come from thence, and expected heere, let us make no
doubt, but he will bee Master of the field (for the present) and will
so hold himselfe, except the Armie of <hi>Ireland</hi> bee reenforced to a
farre higher Li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>t, the charge whereof will make (if I bee not decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved)
both <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> to groane: Wherefore the best way
(in my conceit) to moderate such huge Expences, is for the present
to be carelesse of the Countreys generally throughout the kingdome;
for in seeking both to defend them, and to make head against the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy,
will be too heavie a burden. The principall regard which we
ought to haue, is of the Cities, in every of which I doe wish a
strong Garison both of Horse and foot, able to defend a siege: when
the Enemie shall see that wee are dispersed into Garrisons, either hee
will presently (in his best strength) goe to besiege one of those pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
or else disperse, (because hee hath the Countrey to friend) as wee
doe, if he attempt the besieging of any of our places aforesaid, there
is no doubt, but in such a businesse he will unite all his forces in one,
then may wee be bold to draw all our forces from their severall Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risons,
to a head to releeue that place; and with Gods favour make
no doubt but to enforce the Enemy to rise; if hee disperse, then those
Garrisons will be able to master the Countries about them, and leaue
no habitation to releeue either Spanyard or Irish; and upon occasion
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:18000:213"/>
two or more of these Garrisons may assemble and meet, to effect
greater services, then otherwise can bee done: This fashion of a
warre will in a short time destroy all the Countrey, make the Irish to
curse the Spaniard and themselues, for drawing them hither, driue
the King to an inestimable charge, and hazard by Sea, to victuall and
releeue his Army, which otherwise will perish, ease the Queenes
charge, and secure the chiefe Townes, which is chiefely (and aboue
all other things) to be respected. Supposing the Army would land in
Mounster, in it I would haue principall regard of Corke, Limerick,
and Waterford, in either of which Cities I doe wish there might be
a strong Garrison of three thousand foote and three hundred horses,
one thousand foote more to be dispersed for some poorer places meet
to be kept, so as the Queenes forces should consist of ten thousand
foote and one thousand horse; the rest of the kingdome (where the
Spaniards are not) may bee held in awe with some Garrisons upon
them as now they are: This manner of warre (in my conceit) would
little or nothing increase the charge the Queene is now at, and in a
short time weary both the Spaniard and the Irish.</p>
                     <p>To make it appeare more probable unto you, that these Garrisons
will be able to ruine all the Countrey at their pleasures, although the
Enemy bee never so strong: it cannot bee denyed but sixe thousa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>d
foote and sixe hundred horse may bee drawen from the Garrisons;
and yet those left against the Irish, and Townesmen sufficiently guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded;
with such a light Army, the Commander may goe where hee
list, and lodge as neere the Spaniard (without harme) as hee thinkes
good: for wee haue the same advantage upon them, as the Irish in
lightnesse haue of us, and with such an Army (of the Irish) there is
no doubt to bee made, then it followes that wee shall be able to goe
into every part of the Province, and retreat at our pleasures: To the
contrary, if the Spaniard be strong, and wee in his strength doe fight
with him, the event of battels (being dangerous and uncertaine as
they are) the losse of one field or one dayes disaster, would absolutely
loose the kingdome, if hee come with like numbers as he did the last
yeare, (which I cannot beleeue, because the example hath taught him
more wit) yet I doe not wish that wee should (doe as wee did) pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
besiege him; for Kinsale was bought at so deare a rate (as
while I liue) I will protest against a winter siege, if it may be avoided:
I doe speake within my compasse, I doe verily beleeue, that at that
siege, and after (the sicknesse there gotten) we lost aboue sixe thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
men that dyed: Thus may your honour see what a fashioned
warre, I doe conceiue to bee least in charge and most of use; but for
a farther helpe, it will be needfull for some of the Queenes ships, to
bee evermore upon the coast, to keepe the Spaniard from reliefe of
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:18000:214"/>
victuals; and then there is an apparant hope, that a Spanish Army
cannot any long time subsist in Ireland, for betweene us and them,
and the swarmes of Irish<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ie that will draw into Mounster, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
will be so harassed, as neither the Spaniards or Rebels can avoid
starving. I protest unto your Honour, I doe not project this manner
of a warre for any particular respect unto my selfe, hoping thereby
to haue the managing of it, being unmeet for the Lieutenant of the
Kingdome, to bee where there is not a royall Armie in the field, to
confront an Enemie; and therefore lest I may bee mistaken, if the
motion bee liked of, let it not bee mine: But the Reason that leads
mee to that opinion, is, because I am sure it is the easiest warre for
charge, the surest from hazard, and in the end must prevaile.</p>

infinitly grieved with this unfortunate accident, yet thought it more

within the Bawne adjoyning to the Castle wall, and the thatch
thereof (fired and flaming aloft) happened (through a window) to
catch hold of certaine tallow, and such combustible matter within
the Castle, raging so violently withall, that the Rebels were constrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to quit it, and to make the Bawne their last refuge, wherein they
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:18000:215"/>
had little hope of safety: for they saw the two Captaine <hi>Harvies,</hi> bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,

(mistrusting that weake defence, which could not bee maintayned)
they resolved to sally, and to adventure the recovery of the woods ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyning;
in which attempt, about fiftie of them were put to the
sword, the rest were but few, who by favour of the darke night
escaped; at length the violence of the fire being somewhat appeased,
all industry was vsed to make the Castle tenable, and a Company
being left within, well victualled and furnished with all necessaries,
the Army the next day returned towards Corke: the rumor of <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mocks</hi>

both to terrifie <hi>Cormock,</hi> and to secure the goods of the Subjects in the

The whole body of the Councell adjudging his suite rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable,
the President would not dissent from their unanime opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and therefore his request was granted. The one and twentieth
of October<note place="margin">21. Octob.</note> he came to the President,<note place="margin">He made his submission to the L. Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sident.</note> falling downe vpon his knees,
he humbly (and indeed more passionately then I haue seene any) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sought
her Majesties mercie, no way standing upon his Iustification,
but promising that his future Services should deserue her gracious
favours; onely thus farre in modest tearmes hee alledged for his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse,
(although he knew his Offences great, and himselfe thereby sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to Law) yet that in his heart he still retained the dutie of a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
and therein would remaine so long as life and breath should
remaine within his body. The President and Councell beholding
the man, and weighing his words, which proceeded from him not
without evident testimony of inward griefe, and unfained sorrow,
(although peradventure arising like <hi>Esaus</hi> teares from the sense of his
losse, more then from Conscience, and feeling of his folly) thought
good (upon advised deliberation) to receiue him into her Majesties
grace and favour: And as you haue already heard the Motiues indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
him to demaund it: so shall ye briefely understand the reasons,
by the weight and validitie whereof the State was perswaded to
graunt it.<note place="margin">The reasons that moved the Lo. Presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to accept of Cormocks submission.</note> First, considering the insupportable losse which hee had
sustained since his imprisonment, in the taking of two, and burning
his third Castle, wherein (as being the place of his most especiall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bode)
his best mooueables (whereof hee was very well furnished)
were consumed and burnt; and that the harvest of his Countrey,
betweene her Majesties forces, and the Rebells, (for in the same they
had made their abode for a whole moneth) was valued as might be
esteemed at fiue thousand pounds, which as a just punishment was
fallen upon him.</p>
               <p>Secondly it was well weighed, what a helpe and courage his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bination
would haue afforded to the Rebels, if hee had obstinately
run a rebellious course, for hee was at that time the strongest man of
Followers of any one of the Irish in that Province, and his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey
in strength and fastnesse equall with the worst part of the same,
and that which required no lesse respect was the situation of his
Countrey, reaching even to the wals of Corke, whereby the greatest
part of her Majesties forces, must of necessity haue beene employed
in Muskerry, which would haue given great impediment to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution
of the service in other parts, whereas by receiving him the
warre would bee removed farther off, and the greatest tempest of
disturbance avoyded: that hee was deepely infected, and fowly
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:18000:218"/>
staind with manifold treasons was too manifest, yet this difference
was made betweene him and others, that they were in publike
action professed Traytors, and he a Iugling Traytor; and though hee
had joyned with a forraine Enemy, yet not in so hainous a manner as
some other: for they solicited strangers to invade the kingdome, but
strangers having invaded the kingdome, solicited him to partake
with them; the three Castles (before mentioned) no doubt were
great bridles upon him, and in time (no doubt) would haue wrought
the effects desired, which was to banish him out of his Countrey:
But considering the charge and incumbrance subject to some losse,
that would grow in victualling of them, and many lewde and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>setled
persons ready to joyne with him (if they had perceived him
inclinable to continue a Rebell) which might haue bred newe
broyles, and protracted the warres of Mounster <hi>in infinitum:</hi>
Againe the benefit, that by his prosecution and extirpation might
haue redounded to her Majesty, was that thereby his Land should
haue excheated unto her, which in the opinion of all wise men
would haue proved too deare a purchase: Farther, besides his sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
and his Sonne that was prisoner in England, his second Son
also and his Castle of Blarney were held as pledges upon him: And
wheras the L. Deputie had devised the forme of an oath for the Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
Protectees, he was content to sweare and subscribe to the same
oath, and lastly himselfe with foure of the best Barons of Parliament
in Mounster, were bound in three thousand pounds for his future
loyaltie and subjection, so that hee was bound in heaven and in earth,
before God and before man, by Law and by Nature, and nothing but
onely hell was remayning for his farther assurance.</p>

indeed had not acquainted him with his intent of submission: Sir
<hi>Samuell Bagnall</hi> therefore conjecturing, that so soone as hee should
heare this Lord of Muskery to become a Subject, hee would then
retire himselfe to his old haunt in the Mountaines of Beare and Des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond,
thought the time either now or never to doe service upon this

the <hi>Drisshan,</hi> one of the <hi>Mac Carties</hi> of Muskery (whom the President
had appoynted to attend his directions) and requested him (in the

returned, and reported, that hee had found the Rebels secure (as hee
imagined) from all feare or suspition, and would undertake to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct,
and guid the forces directly to their Campe: upon this intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
it was not long before Sir <hi>Samuell</hi> and his Companies were all
in Armes, disposing them into two bodies, Captaine <hi>Sidley</hi> (who
had the poynt) had fiue and twenty out of every Company, with
officers proportionable for his numbers, and Sir <hi>Samuell</hi> himselfe
with the rest marched close up after them, and the Horse came in the

manner they held on till they came so neere to the Rebels quarters,
as that they might discerne their fires, then they made halte, and sent
<hi>Owen Mac Teg,</hi> with his cosen <hi>Owen Olough</hi> one of the <hi>Mac Swynes,</hi>

and to descry more particularly the manner of their encamping;
they gathering courage by the countenance of the Army, which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached

returning to the Colonell, certified him that they were lodged in

               <p>The President to make the speedier prosecution, and expedition in
the affaires of the Province, caused the Rising out of the Countrey
to bee assembled to the number of sixteene hundred (at their owne

                  <note place="margin">The Rising out of the country com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the Lord Barries charge.</note> These Provinciall
Forces were not prepared for any great need that was of their ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
it was thought meet to draw as many hands together as conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niently
might bee, who according to their manner, for spoyles sake,
would not spare their dearest friends. And also it was thought no
ill policie to make the Irish draw bloud one upon another, whereby
their private quarrels might advance the publike service. The Presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
had first determined himselfe in person with fiue hundred Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish,
(joyned to the Provincials) to haue taken the field; but his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions
were casually diverted by Letters from the Lord Deputie,
who signifying that his Lordship purposed to bee at Galway<note place="margin">The L. De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puty requires the L. Presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to meete him at Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.</note> about

set apart) immediatly to repayre thither, to consult about certaine af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires
much importing the service of the State, by reason whereof the

               <p>In this meane time the Rebell <hi>Tirrell,</hi> not liking to stay any longer
in the Aire of Mounster, wherein hee had runne many dangers, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thought
himselfe of a retreat out of the Province, hoping that the
President would condiscend to any composition, rather then to bee
troubled with his company,<note place="margin">A message fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the rebell Tirrel to the L. President, and his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere.</note> whereupon he sent his inward servant
<hi>Laghlin Odallye</hi> (afore mentioned in this discourse) unto Corke, who
comming to the President, told him, that his Captaine (meaning <hi>Tir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell</hi>)
would bee content to leaue the Province, and would heereafter
this, (so as hee might haue a Pardon, a Pension, and a Company of
Foot in her Majesties pay) serue the Queene, and deserue the reward
demaunded by his future services. The President knowing that
for want of food hee would be forced ere the spring of the yeare to
depart; And also assuring himselfe (within that time) to get some
good draught to bee drawen upon him by some of the Provinciall
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:18000:221"/>
Rebells, who now being heart-broken, would doe any thing for
their Pardons, or for a little money, not onely sleightly rejected his
offers, but bid <hi>Odalley</hi> tell him, That although hee were never so
warie, yet hee doubted not before it were long, to haue his head
sent unto him in a bag, willing him to forbeare to send any more
unto him.</p>
               <p>While these forces aforesaid were gathering according to the dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
afore-recited, the Governor of Kerry losing no opportunity,
and forbearing no labour, had the like fortune upon the Knight of
Kerry,<note place="margin">The Knight of Kerry de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated by Sir Ch. Wilmot.</note> as Sir <hi>Samuel Bagnall</hi> had upon <hi>Tirrell;</hi> for being conducted
to his Quarter in the night, killed fortie of his men, and tooke from
him all his whole substance, which consisted of fiue hundred cowes,
two hundred garrans, and two moneths provision of Meale and
Butter for his Souldiers; which small spoyle was a great losse to the
poore Knight: for thereby hee being disfurnished of all his provisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
&amp; disabled to minister entertainment to his followers, and having
no Castle whereunto he might safely retreat, was constrained (like a
Wolfe) to shelter himselfe in waste woods and desolate mountaines,
untill he could worke meanes with Sir <hi>Charles</hi> to accept his humble
submission, which incontinently (upon his defeat) hee earnestly soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited,
by the meanes of <hi>Osulevan More.</hi> And surely this Service was
of good consequence for the setling of Kerry: for <hi>Thomas Oge,</hi> indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
by the example of the Knight, and likewise <hi>Donnell Osulevan,</hi>
Son to the said <hi>Osulevan More,</hi> did all joyntly submit themselues,<note place="margin">The Knight of Kerry<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Th. Oge, &amp; Osu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>levan Mores sonne, make their submis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions.</note> and
her Majesties Protection graunted them: The former performed as
much as was promised; but the latter, in the interim that hee should
haue put in Sureties for his loyaltie, (according to a Clause inserted
in his Protection) did in the malice of his heart to our Nation, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
a most base and traiterous murder upon a Sergeant and ten Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
going after Sir <hi>Charles</hi> towards Donkerran, who not suspecting

comming to seeke the Enemy in their Campe, hee entered into their

The governour sent the Lord <hi>Barry</hi> with some of his light
foote after them, but all in vaine, for they flew so swift with the
wings of feare, as passing by many preyes directly in the way (as they
passed) yet they never made so much stay as to molest either the Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle

which <hi>Osulevan</hi> had gotten, and kept for his transportation into
<hi>Spaine,</hi> when he should be enforced thereunto; they tooke also from
thence certaine Cowes and Sheepe, which were reserved there as in
a sure storehouse, and put the Churles to the sword that inhabited
therein. The Warders of the Castles of Ardea, and Carricknesse<note place="margin">The Castles of Ardea and Carrick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse rende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</note> on

neither place of safetie whereunto hee might retyre, nor Corne or
Cattell to feed himselfe, much lesse to uphold or renew any warre a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the State.</p>
               <p>The sharpnesse of this Winter journey did exceedingly weaken
our<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Companies: for the Mountaines of Beare being at that time
quite covered with snow, tasted the strong bodies, whereby many
returned sicke, and some unable to endure the extreamity, dyed stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding centinell:
But whilest this service was in prosecution in Beare,
the President on his journey towards the Lord Deputie, chanced to
meet with some of the Countrey risings out, to the number of foure
hundred foote or thereabouts, that came short of the rest, that were
under the commands of the Lord <hi>Barry,</hi> and Sir <hi>George Thornton:</hi>
And understanding that the Sonnes of Sir <hi>Owen Mac Cartie,</hi> and
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:18000:226"/>
                  <hi>Donnogh Keugh,</hi> brother to <hi>Florence Mac Cartie,</hi> were retyred with
their Creats and Followers into the strengths of Carbery, his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
commanded Captaine <hi>Taffe</hi> (with the said risings out) fourtie
of Sir <hi>Edward Wingfields</hi> Company,<note place="margin">Cap. Taffe employed against the Rebels in Carbry.</note> and his owne troope of Horse
to draw into those parts, and to endeavour the best service hee could
upon them: Whilest the rest were busied by the Governour of Ker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
in Desmond as aforesaid, wherein it pleased God to giue him good
successe, for on the fifth of Ianuary, his foote entering their Fastnesse,
tooke a prey of two or three hundred Cowes and Garrans; the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels
in pursuit of their Cattle, gaue them so braue a charge, as they
were disordered, whereby some of them were slaine, which Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
<hi>Taffe</hi> perceiving, being in the head of his Horse troope, in the
skirt of the Fastnesse, and espying some of their Horsemen to doe
much hurt upon our foote, charged them into the wood, slew foure
of their Horsemen, and put all the rest to rout, wherewith our men
being encouraged pursued them: <hi>Owen Mac Eggan</hi> (the Popes Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
Vicar<note place="margin">The Popes Vicar slaine, and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels defea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</note> so often before mentioned) to put fresh heart into his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
with his sword drawne in one hand, and his portius and
beades in the other, with one hundred men led by himselfe, he came
boldly up to the sword, and mainetayned a hot skirmish, untill hee
was slaine with a shot, whereupon his men (together with a fresh
charge of our horse) were so amazed and terrified, partly by his
death, and partly by their owne danger, that they brake instantly,
and for better expedition throwing away their Armes, leaped into
the river Bandon, hoping by that meanes to escape, but that little
availed them, for they all for the most part were either killed or
drowned in the river; there were slaine in this service (besides <hi>Owen
Mac Eggan,</hi> who was of more worth then all the rest) aboue one
hundred and twenty Rebels, and of the Provinciall rising out of our
part, a good number lost their liues, and many of Captaine <hi>Taffes</hi>
horses hurt, wee got the Armes of 100. and fourtie, and all their hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
cowes, sheepe and garrans, that were in the Countrey neere ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyning:
There was also taken a Papist Priest, being as it seemed a
Chaplaine to <hi>Mac Eggan,</hi> whom the President (shortly after) caused
to be executed in Corke.</p>
               <p>Vpon this discomfiture, the <hi>Carties</hi> who formerly had beene Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners
to the President for protection, but denyed, became suitors to
Captaine <hi>Taffe</hi> in the like, who not knowing of the good successe,
that the Governour had against the other Rebels (according to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
before given him by the President, that hee should accept
their submission, after a blow given them, if it were humbly sought)
did grant protection to them and their Followers; and upon the Presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents
returne from Galway, Captaine <hi>Taffe</hi> having then in his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:18000:226"/>
upon the high way, not farre from Moyallo, presented them to
his Lordship,<note place="margin">The Carties of Carby submitted themselues to the Lord President.</note> who with great shew of unfayned penitence, desired
his allowance, and acceptation of their submission, who to gratifie
the service of Captaine <hi>Taffe,</hi> and to ratifie his promise assented there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto,
whereby all Carbery (a very large and spacious Countrey) was
wholly reduced to subjection, no one open Traytor remayning
therein. A principall meanes of this suddaine and vniuersall reducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
was the death of that traitorly Priest <hi>Owen Mac Eggan,</hi> which
doubtlesse was more beneficiall to the State, then to haue gotten the
head of the most capitall Rebell in Mounster, for the respect that
was borne unto him (by reason of his authority from the Pope) and
the credit which hee had obtayned in Spaine, was so great, as his
power was in a manner absolute over them all, and he onely was the
meanes of their obdurate obstinacie: his dignity in being the Popes
<hi>Vicarius Apostolicus,</hi> did hold them in vassalage unto him, and the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings
given him in Mounster by the Popes grant, were to be valued
(if hee might quietly haue enjoyed them) at three thousand pounds
<hi>per Annum.</hi> And farther to ingage the Popish Clergy of Ireland unto
him, hee had power to dispose at his pleasure of all the spirituall li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings
in the Province of Mounster, by which authority, together
with the credit he had gotten with the King of Spaine (well testified
by the trust committed to him in transporting and disposing the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
money, last brought into Ireland) he had obtayned in a manner
all power, both over the temporality and spirituality of Mounster, and
to depaint him in his true colours, a more malitious Traytor against
the State and Crowne of England, never breathed, which well ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
by the barbarous tyranny hee exercised upon his owne Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triemen;
for assoone as any prisoners were taken (though of his
owne Countrey, birth and religion) yet if they had served the
Queene, he caused them first (in piety as he pretended) to bee confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
and absolved, and instantly (in his owne sight) would hee cause
them to bee murdered, which religious tyranny in him was held for
sanctity. The President upon his returne to Corke, employed certaine
Messengers whom hee might trust, into the Countrey to make search
in such places as <hi>Mac Eggan</hi> vsually resided, for such bookes and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
as were belonging unto him: divers bookes of schoole divinity
(for the most part) were gotten, all which by the Presidents gift fell
to my share, and certaine papers, amongst the which I will onely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert

               <p>Let the understanding Reader now surcease to marvell, that the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
of Rome doth striue and struggle to depose Princes, and to ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
and incourage Subjects to heathenish and inhumane murders,
and rebellions, since hee dareth (like the ancient Gyants) to attempt
and assault Heaven it selfe, and to displant and displace from the
Throne of his Majestie Christ Iesus himselfe, who is God to be bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
for evermore: what is it else, but to make the Precepts and Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
of men, equivalent with the doctrine and Commandements
of God? what is it else but to usurpe an absolute and universall pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
and authoritie over the flocke of Christ, (as his Lieutenant and
Vicar) for the warrant whereof hee hath no Commission, nor was
hee called thereunto as <hi>Aaron</hi> was? Lastly, what is it else, but to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mooue
and pull downe the Son of God from his triumphant glory,
where he sitteth at the right hand of his Father, (and where he must
abide, (the holy Apostle bearing witnesse) till all his enemies be sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued
under his feet) and to bring backe his glorified body, and Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
soule, at the becke and word of every hedge Priest, into their sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crilegious
Sacrament of the Altar; Surely a man need go no further
for testimony, seeing the Antichristian lowing of this prophane Bull,
doth liuely delineate, and plainely demonstrate that purple Harlot,
which hath made all nations drunke with the dregs of her fornicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
having seated her selfe upon the seven hils of Rome: I should be
over troublesome to the Reader, to shake up all the trumpery, and
rake in all the durt contayned in his Buls belly: yet one thing more
I cannot passe over with silence, namely for as much as the Pope per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth
that his kingdome cannot long stand, but that Babell must
fall, and Antichrist must be consumed with the breath of the Lords
mouth; therefore with prudent care, and politicke circumspection,
hee suffereth none to bee initiated into his holy Sacrament of orders,
nor preferred to any Ecclesiasticall promotion, but hee is first bound
by his hand, word, and corporall oath, to mainetaine and defend the
pompe, honour, priviledges, prerogatiues, and doctrines of the Sea of
Rome, especially and namely such as are contradictorily repugnant
to the written word of God: And that they shall persecute and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugne
all those (whether Prince or people) that shall bee adjudged
Heretikes or Schismatikes in the Popes consistory: Consider there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:18000:231"/>
I beseech thee gentle Reader, whether any Priest that taketh this
oath (for they all take it) can bee accounted a good Subject to the
Crowne of England, but to proceed.</p>

his Lordship signified by his Letters to the Lords of her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties
privie Councell in England; that although the hearts of the
Irish were no lesse corrupt then heretofore, and that nothing but the

would hee undertake (God assisting) that no rebellion should arise in
the Province, except the Townes (who grew daily into more deeper
discontentments,<note place="margin">False r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

revolt, which in his judgement was unlikely. About this time
it was vulgarly reported in England, by some who had their tongues
poynted with slaunder, and their hearts stuffed with malice, that
Mounster was newly burning with fresh flames of rebellion, that
the Vicount <hi>Roch,</hi> the Lord of <hi>Cahyr,</hi> and <hi>Cormock Mac Dermond</hi> had
entered into open hostility, and that <hi>Tirrell</hi> was come againe into
the Province, and had taken the prey of Moyallo from the Garrison
at noone day; although the world may bee satisfied concerning
these slaunderous reports, by that which hath beene already delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,

yet to giue more particular satisfaction to all, or to any that
should make question hereof. First the Lord <hi>Roch</hi> he was never
touched with the least spot of disloyaltie against her Majesty, yea
such loyall constancie did hee alwayes embrace and practise, that in
the vniuersall inundation of treasons, when all the Province in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall,
and his father in particular, did combine against their annoynted
Soveraigne, at that time, and ever since did hee continue himselfe

hee was himselfe in person with Sir <hi>Charles Wilmot,</hi> at the late

either man or matter, seeing you haue made so good
demonstration of your obedience, and entire affection to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme

good opinion, as his merite there procured your owne plentifull
testimony of the same; even when all trees àid shew what fruits they bare:
His comming over was to doe his duty to us, where hee was desirous (as other
Noble-men haue done) to haue stayed some time, unlesse some occasion for our
seruice should necessarily require his returne: Of which kind, because the
one hath presented it selfe, by the going of our Deputy into that Province,
where his possessions lye, and that the weake estate of his mother likewise fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
out to bee such, as (if Almighty God should call her before the same
were better setled) many inconveniences might fall to the house by his absence,
hee is now returned backe, with as much expedition as hee can: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
wee doe (as to one of our principall Councellors in that state) recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
him to you to be furthered and assisted in all his occasions, wherein as we
know that publicke triall which hee hath made of himselfe (to the honour of
the Nobility of that kingdome) whereof so many scandalous rumours haue
beene spred, onely to invite our Enemies under that opinion of their ill affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
both hath, and will invite you to loue him, so wee doe thinke that wee
haue missed our markes in <hi>George,</hi> if hee shall not haue the best fruits,
which either your publike credit, or private friendship may afford, whosoeuer
wee shall recommend as now wee doe this Noble-man (besides his publike de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert)
for many other constant professions of his humble and reverent affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
towards our selfe: Let this therefore suffice for him, and for your selfe,
of whom wee can say no more, then heretofore wee haue done, either of our
good opinion of you, or of our gratious thankes, for all your great and honest
services: Given under our Signet at our Pallace of <hi>Westminster</hi> the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venteenth

trayterous complots: To prevent therefore such mischiefes as might
grow unto the State, from his solicitations in Spaine; the President
was content, that Sir <hi>George Thornton</hi> should send a messenger unto
him (being then in the Rebels Campe) to revoke and recall him if

storme, more desired to arriue into his wished Harbour,
nor a virgin Bride, after a lingering and desperate loue, more longing
for the celebration of her nuptiall, then the Lord President was to
goe for England, yet was hee content to deferre his private affections,
in regard of the publike charge committed unto him; and therefore
first hee sent for Sir <hi>Charles Wilmot</hi> out of Kerry, acquainting onely
him with that Iourney, because his purpose was, having before hand
had good experience of his sufficiencie, to leaue him in speciall trust
with the government in his absence. Then hee tooke order for the

                        <head>A Letter sent by the Lord President from the Lord Deputy

                        <p>MAy it please your Lordships; Although I am unwilling to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
you often of the present estate of this kingdome, or of
any particular accidents or services, because the one is subject
to so much alteration, and the other lightly delivered unto all that are
not present, with such uncertaintie, and that I am loath to make any
project unto your Lordships, either of my requests to you, or my
owne resolutions heere, since so many things fall suddenly out, which
may alter the grounds of either; yet since I doe write now by one
that can so sufficiently supply the defects of a Letter, I haue presumed
at this time to impart unto your Lordships that I thinke fit to bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred,
or doe determine on: most humbly desiring your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships,
that if I erre in the one, or hereafter alter the other, you will not
impute it to my want of sinceritie, or constancie, but to the nature of
the subject whereof I must treat, or of the matter whereon I worke:
And first to present unto your Lordships the outward face of the
foure Provinces, and after to guesse (as neere as I can) at their disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
Mounster by the good government and industry of the Lord
President, is cleare of any force in rebellion, except some few unable
to make any forcible head. In Leinster, there is not one declared Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell:
In Connaght there is none but in <hi>Orwrks</hi> Countrey: In Vlster
none but <hi>Tyrone,</hi> and <hi>Bryan Mac Art,</hi> who was never Lord of any
country, and now doth with a Body of loose men, &amp; some Creaghts
continue in Glancomkynes, or neere the Borders thereof. <hi>Cohonoght
Macguyre</hi> sometimes Lord of Fermannagh, is banished out of the
country, who liues with <hi>Orwrke,</hi> and at this time <hi>Connor Roe Macguire</hi>
is possessed of it by the Queene, and holds it for her. I beleeue, that
generally the Lords of the Countreyes that are reclaimed, desire a
peace, though they will be wavering, till their Lands and Estates are
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:18000:239"/>
assured unto them from her Majestie, and as long as they see a partie
in rebellion to subsist, that is of power<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to ruine them if they continue
Subjects, or otherwise shall be doubtfull of our defence. All that are
out, doe seeke for mercy, except <hi>Orwrke</hi> and <hi>Osulevan,</hi> who is now
with <hi>Orwrke;</hi> and these are obstinate only out of their diffidence, to
bee safe in any forgiuenesse. The loose men, and such as are onely
Captaines of Bonnaghts, as <hi>Tirrell,</hi> and <hi>Brian Mac Art,</hi> will nourish
the warre as long as they see any possibilitie to subsist, and like ill hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours,
haue recourse to any part that is unfound. The Nobilitie,
Townes, and English Irish, are for the most part as weary of the
warre as any, but unwilling to haue it ended, generally for feare that
upon a peace will ensue a severe reformation of Religion; and in
particular, many bordering Gentlemen that were made poore by
their owne faults, or by Rebels incursions, continue their Spleene to
them now they are become subjects; and having used to helpe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
by stealths, did never more use them, nor better prevailed in
them, then now that these Submittees haue layed aside their owne
defence, and betaken themselues to the protection and justice of the
State; and many of them haue tasted so much sweet in Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
that they rather de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ire a warre to continue them, then a quiet
Harvest that might arise out of their owne honest labour: so that I
doe finde none more pernicious Instruments of a new warre, then
some of these. In the meane time, <hi>Tyrone</hi> while hee shall liue, will
blow every sparke of discontent, or new hopes that shall lye hid in
a corner of the Kingdome, and before hee shall be utterly extingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed,
make many blazes, and sometimes set on fire, or consume the
next subjects unto him. I am perswaded that his combination is
already broken, and it is apparant, that his meanes to subsist in any
power, is overthrowne: but how long hee may liue as a wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kerne,
and what new accidents may fall out while he doth live I
know not. If it bee imputed to my fault, that notwithstanding her
Majesties great Forces, hee doth still liue, I beseech your Lordships to
remember how securely the <hi>Banditoes</hi> of Italy doe liue, betweene the
power of the King of Spaine and the Pope. How many men of all
Countreyes of severall times, haue in such sort preserved themselues
long from the great power of Princes, but especially in this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey
where there are so many difficulties to carry an Armie, in most
places so many unaccessable strengths for them to flye unto; and
then to bee pleased to consider the great worke that first I had to
breake this maine Rebellion, to defend the Kingdome from a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
Invasion of a mightie forraine Prince, with so strong a
partie in the Countrey, and now the difficultie to root out scatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
Troopes, that had so many unaccessable Dennes to lurke in,
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:18000:240"/>
which as they are by Nature of extreame strength and perill to bee
attempted: so it is unpossible for any people Naturally and by Art
to make greater use of them; And though with infinite dangers wee
doe beat them out of one, yet is there no possibilitie for us to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
them with such agilitie, as they will flye to another; And it is
most sure, that never Traytor knew better how to keepe his owne
head, then this; nor any Subjects haue a more dreadfull awe, to
lay violent hands on their sacred Prince, then these people haue to
touch the person of their <hi>Oneales,</hi> and hee that hath as pestilent a
judgement, as ever any had to nourish and to spread his owne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
hath the ancient swelling, and desire of liberty in a conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
Nation to worke upon, their feare to bee rooted out, or to haue
their old faults punished upon all particular discontents, and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
over all the kingdome, the feare of a persecution for religion,
the debasing of the Coyne (which is grievous unto all sorts) and a
dearth and famine which is already begun, and must of necessity
grow shortly to extremity; the least of which alone, haue beene ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
times sufficient motiues, to driue the best and most quiet estates
into suddaine confusion: These will keepe all spirits from setling,
breed new combinations, and (I feare) even stirre the Townes
themselues to solicit forraine aid with promise to cast themselues
into their protection: And although it bee true, that if it had plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
her Majesty to haue longer continued her Army in greater
strength, I should the better haue provided for what these clouds
doe threaten, and sooner and more easily, either haue made this
Countrey a rased Table, wherein shee might haue written her owne
Lawes, or haue tyed the ill disposed and rebellious hands, till I had
surely planted such a Government, as would haue overgrowne and
killed any weeds that should haue risen under it: Yet since the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitie
of the State doeth so urge a diminution of this great expence,
I will not despayre to goe on with this worke, through all these
difficulties, if wee be not interrupted by forraine Forces, although
perchance wee may be encountred with some new irruptions, and
(by often adventuring) with some disasters, and it may bee your
Lordships shall sometimes heare of some spoiles done upon the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
from the which it is impossible to preserue them in all places
with farre greater forces then ever yet were kept in this Kingdome:
And although it hath beene seldome heard, that an Armie hath
beene carried on with so continuall Action, and enduring without
any intermission of Winter breathings, and that the difficulties at
this time to keepe any Forces in the place where wee must make the
Warre, (but especially our Horse) are almost beyond any hope to
prevent, yet with the favour of God, and her Majesties Fortune,
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:18000:240"/>
I doe determine my selfe to drawe into the Field, assoone as I haue
received her Majesties Commaundements by the Commissioners,
who it hath pleased her to send over, and in the meane time I hope
by mine owne presence or Directions, to set every partie on worke,
that doth adjoyne, or may bee drawne against any force that now
doth remaine in rebellion. In which Iourney the successe must bee
in the hands of GOD; but I will confidently promise to omit no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
that is possible by us to bee done, to giue the last blow unto the
Rebellion. But as all paine and anguish impatient of the present,
doeth use change for a remedie: so will it bee impossible for us to
settle the minds of these people unto a Peace, or reduce them unto
Order, while they feele the smart of these sensible griefes, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parant
feares which I haue remembred to your Lordships, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
some hope of redresse or securitie. Therefore I will presume,
(how unworthie soever I haue been) since it concernes the Province
her Majestie hath given mee, with all humblenesse to lay before your
graue Iudgements, some few things which I thinke necessary to bee

                        <p>And first, whereas the alteration of the Coyne, and taking away
of the exchange in such measure as it was first promised, hath bred
a generall grievance unto men of all qualities, and so many incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities
to all sorts, that it is beyond the Iudgement of any that I
can heare, to prevent a con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>usion in this Estate, by the continuance
thereof, that (at the least) it would please your Lordships to put
this people in some certaine hope, that upon the end of the warre,
this newe Standard shall bee abolished or eased; And that in the
meane time the Armie may bee favourably dealt with in the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change,
since by the last Proclamation your Lordships sent over,
they doe conceiue their case will bee more hard then any others:
for if they haue allowed them nothing but indefinitely as much as
they shall meerely gaine out of their Entertainments, that will
prooue nothing to the greater part: For the onely possibilitie to
make them to liue upon their Entertainment, will bee to allowe
them Exchange for the greatest part thereof, since now they doe
not onely pay excessiue prizes for all things, but can hardly get any
thing for this Money; And although wee haue presumed to alter
(in shew, though not in effect) the Proclamation in that poynt, by
retayning a power in our selues to proportion their allowance for
Exchange: yet was it with a minde to conforme our proceedings
therein according to your Lordships next directions, and therefore
doe humbly desire to know your pleasures therein. For our opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the last project it pleased your Lordships to send us, I doe
humbly leaue it to our generall Letters: Only as for my selfe I made
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:18000:241"/>
overture to the Councell in the other you sent directly onely to my
selfe; and because I found them generally to concurre, that it would
prooue as dangerous as the first, I did not thinke it fit any other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
to declare your Lordships pleasure therein. And whereas it
pleased your Lordships in your last Letters to command us to deale
moderately in the great matter of Religion, I had before the receipt
of your Lordships Letters presumed to advise such as dealt in it, for
a time to hold a more restraynt hand therein, and wee were both
thinking our selues what course to take in the Revocation of what
was already done, with least incouragement to them and others,
since the feare that this course begun in Dublin would fall upon the
rest, was apprehended over all the Kingdome: So that I thinke
your Lordships Direction was to great purpose, and the other course
might haue overthrowne the meanes to our owne end of Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Religion: Not that I thinke too great precisenesse can bee
used in the reforming of our selues, the abuses of our owne Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie,
Church-livings, or Discipline; nor that the trueth of the Gospell
can with too great vehemencie or industrie bee set forward in all
places, and by all or<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>inarie meanes most proper unto it selfe, that
was first set foorth, and spread in meeknesse; not that I thinke any
corporall prosecution or punishment can bee too severe for such as
shall bee found seditious Instruments of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

not that I thinke it fit, that any principall Magistrates should
bee chosen without taking the Oath of Obedience, nor tollerated in
absenting themselues from publique Divine Service, but that wee
may bee advised how wee doe punish in their bodies or goods, any
such onely for Religion, as doe professe to bee faithfull Subjects to
her Majestie, and against whom the contrary cannot bee prooved.
And <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>ince, if the Irish were utterly rooted out, there was much lesse
likelihood that this Countrey could bee thereby in any time planted
by the English, since they are so farre from inhabiting well any part
of that they haue already; &amp; that more than is likely to be inhabited,
may be easily chosen out and reserved in such places by the sea side, or
upon great Rivers, as may bee planted to great purpose, for a fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
absolute reducement of this Countrey, I thinke it would as
much avayle the speedy setling of this Countrey as any thing; that
it would please her Majestie to deale liberally with the Irish Lords
of Countreyes, or such as are now of great reputation among them,
in the distribution of such Lands as they haue formerly possessed, or
the State heere can make little use of for her Majestie; If they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
as they ought to doe, and yeeld the Queene as much commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie
as shee may otherwise expect, shee hath made a good purchase
of such Subjects for such Land. If any of them heereafter be disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:18000:241"/>
to her Lawes, or breake foorth in Rebellion, shee may when
they shall bee more divided, ruine them more easily for example un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
others, and (if it be thought fit) may plant English or other Irish
in their Countreyes: For although there ever haue beene, and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after
may bee small eruptions in some places, which at the first
may easily bee suppressed, yet the suffering them to grow to that ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
head and combination, did questionlesse proceed from great
errour in the judgement heere, and may be easily (as I thinke) pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
hereafter. And further, it may please her Majestie to ground
her resolution for the time and numbers of the next abatement of
the List of her Armie somewhat upon our poore advise from hence,
and to beleeue, that wee will not so farre corrupt our Iudgements
with any private respects, and without necessitie, to continue her
Charge, seeing wee doe throughly conceiue how grievous it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
her Estate, and that wee may not bee precisely tyed to an Esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishment
that shall conclude the payments of the Treasure, since it
hath ever been thought fit to bee otherwise, till the comming over
of the Earle of <hi>Essex;</hi> and some such extraordinarie Occasions may
fall out, that it will bee dangerous to attend your Lordships Reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions,
and when it will bee safe to diminish the Armie heere, that
there may bee some course thought of by some other Employment,
to disburthen this Countrey of the idle Sword-men, in whom I
finde an inclination apt enough to bee carried elsewhere, either by
some of this Countrey of best reputation among them, or in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies
as now they stand under English Captaines, who may bee
reinforced with the greatest part of Irish; That it may bee left to
our discretion to make Passages and Bridges into Countreyes, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
unaccessable, and to build little Pyles of stone in such Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
as shall bee thought fittest, to bee continuall Bridles upon the
people, by the commoditie of which wee may at any time drawe
the greatest part of the Armie together, to make a Head against any
part that shall first breake out, and yet reserue the places onely with
a Ward to put in greater Forces as occasion shall require, which I
am perswaded will prooue great Pledges upon this Countrey, that
upon any urgent cause the Queene may safely draw the greatest part
of her Armie heere out of the Kingdome, to bee employed at least
for a time elsewhere, wherein I beseech your Lordships to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
what a strength so many experienced Captaines and Souldiers
would bee, to any Armie of new men erected in England, against an
Invasion, or sent abroad in any offensiue warre: But untill these
places bee built, I cannot conceiue how her Majestie (with any safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie)
can make any great diminution of her Armie. Lastly, I doe
humbly desire your Lordships to receiue the further explanation of
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:18000:242"/>
my meaning, and confirmation of my reasons that doe induce mee
unto these propositions: for the Lord President of Mounster, who
as he hath been a very worthy Actor in the reducement and defence
of this Kingdome, so doe I thinke him to be the best able to giue you
through account of the present Estate, and future providence for the
preservation thereof; wherein it may please your Lordships to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
his opinion of the hazard this Kingdome is like to runne in,
if it should by any mightie Power be invaded, and how hard it will
bee for us in any measure to provide for the present defence, if any
such bee intended, and withall to goe on with the suppression of
these that are left in rebellion, so that wee must either adventure the
kindling of this fire that is almost extinguished, or intending onely
that, leaue the other to exceeding perill. And thus having remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred
to your Lordships the most materiall poynts (as I conceiue) that
are fittest for the present to bee considered of, I doe humbly recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
my selfe and them to your Lordships favour. From her Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties
Castle of Dublin the sixe and twentieth of <hi>February,</hi> 1602.</p>
                        <p>After the Lord Deputie departed, by reason of Easterly winds the
President was stayed aboue three weekes in Dublin, during which
time, every day Posts were emploied betweene them, untill the twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth
of <hi>March,</hi> which was the day the Lord President set saile for
England; the day following hee arrived at Bewmarris: at his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
to Chester, hee met with the lamentable newes of the decease
of his good and gracious Mistresse Queene <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> for whom, (as
he had good cause) he extreamely mourned; But two dayes follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
(being at Lichfield) he assisted the Major in the proclaiming of
King <hi>Iames,</hi> which gaue him new life, whom I beseech God long to
preserue and continue his Posteritie for ever, over his triumphant
Monarchy of <hi>Great Brittaine</hi> and <hi>Ireland.</hi>
