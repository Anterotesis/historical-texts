            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

THE PREFACE TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>IN reading many of the late Addresses, I could not forbear thinking of those Angels which <hi>Mahomet</hi> saw, whose Horns were half Fire, and half Snow: those contrarieties which they wore on the out-side of their Heads, methought, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of our Addressers had got on the in-side of theirs. For with a brave and warm Zeal for the Protestant Religion, and a Protestant Prince, they generously offered their <hi>Lives and Fortunes, and the last drop of Blood, in defence of his Majesty, and the Religion now established by Law;</hi> and by and by, the same Lives and Fortunes, and last drop of Blood, are promised over a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to a Popish Successor. What is this but clapping cold Snow upon the Head of all their Protestant Zeal? For he that offers his Service to both of these together, lists himself under two the most adverse Parties in the World, and is <hi>Guelph</hi> and <hi>Gibeline</hi> at once. What benefit a Popish Successor can <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> from Lives and Fortunes, spent in defence


<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:47487:3"/>
of the Protestant Religion, he may put in his Eye: And what the Protestant Religion gets by Lives and Fortunes spent in the Service of a Popish Successor, will be over the left Shoulder.</p>
            <p>But this contradictious Zeal was nothing near so surprising, as that of our Friends of <hi>Rippon,</hi> who beseech his Majesty, and are very sollicitous, lest he should agree to a Bill of Exclusion; (for plain English is as well understood on this side the <hi>Trent,</hi> as on the other) and seem to be very much afraid of losing the great Blessing of a Popish Successor. All the sober Men that I have met with, who remain unsatisfied as to a Bill of Exclusion, do nevertheless acknowledge, That a <hi>Popish Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessor will be a heavy Judgment of God to this Nation, to which we must pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently submit, as we do to all other Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities.</hi> But did ever Men pray for a Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and make it their humble Request, that they might be sure of it? Do they not, on the other hand, when it begins to threaten them, heartily deprecate the Evil, and are they not earnest with God to avert it? Nay, do they not moreover use all lawful humane means to prevent it? There is no Judgment represented in Scripture, to be so immediately the stroke of God, as the Plague: <hi>David,</hi> in his great strait, made choice of it under that Notion; when he desired rather to fall into the Hands of God than into the hands of Men; and yet Men do constantly make use of all lawful means to prevent it. For, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides their using <hi>Hippocrates's</hi> Receipt of <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tò, longè, tardè,</hi> and running away from it; they make no scruple of antidoting and fortifying themselves against it. They strive with an infected Air, and with Fires, and Fumes of Pitch and Tar, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour


<pb n="v" facs="tcp:47487:3"/>
to correct it. Nay, they imprison Men that are infected, and put them under a very close confinement, when they have committed no Fault, nor done any thing to foreit their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, only that they may thereby preserve o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. This, and many other things are done by Law, till such time, as it pleases God to countermand that heavy Judgment. I was therefore perfectly posed with that Address, and could not tell what to make of it. The least I could think of them was this, That if they were Protestants, they were Men weary of their Religion, who were so undone for a Prince, a great part of whose Religion it is, to persecute and extirpate theirs. And con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering with my self, what Precedents or Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples they might have of this strange Conduct, and being able to find none; instead thereof, I had an imperfect remembrance of the quite contrary carriage of the Primitive Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans towards <hi>Julian.</hi> In which, having throughly satisfied my self, I was willing to give the world this short Scheme of it. I can term it no otherwise, for whoever pleases to look into those places which I have cited, will find, that I have not impove ished the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; but have left, untouched, sufficient mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials for whole Volumes, to any one that shall be disposed to write them.</p>
            <p>Having told you the occasion of writing this Discourse, I shall say somewhat of every part of it. I have been very brief in <hi>Julian's</hi> Life, because I wrote it, only to render the following Discourse concerning his Succession intelligible; and yet, I am sure, I have not omitted any of the main strokes of it. The Christians behaviour towards him was neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily added, as a collateral proof, and illustra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their sense about his Succession. Indeed,


<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:47487:4"/>
if they had been worthy to have known <hi>Juli. an's</hi> Religion, before he came to be Emperor, we had not had that part to write; but they that report, and do not invent, must take things as they are. This behaviour of theirs being so contrary to what is commonly reported of them, and to the carriage of former Christians, I found it necessary to make some few Remarks upon it; and to shew that there was as wide a difference betwixt their Case, and that of the first Christians, as Laws for men, and against men, could possibly make. And if other men are for taking Laws and no Laws, and shake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them together in a Bag, and for making the Result of either of them to be Passive Obedience, I cannot help that; no more than I can my own belief of this as a first Principle, that the Laws of a Man's Country are the measures of all Civil Obedience; or my belief, that any kind of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, either Active or Passive, without a Law to require it, is like one of the marvellous Accidents in Transubstantiation, which makes a shift to subsist, when it has lost its Subject. But there it was, that I met with the Doctrine of Passive Obedience; which when it is taught without any regard to Laws, and is prescri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed both without Law and against Law, is not Evangelical but Mahumetane, and the very Turkish Doctrine of the Bow-string. In such a short Discourse, it was impossible for me to say the tenth part of what is to be said, to shew how intollerable that Doctrine is, and how contrary, both to the Gospel, and to the Law of the Land. Christianity is so far from enslaving us, or devesting us of those Rights and Priviledges which we have already, that it encourages us to procure more Liberties and Franchises, if we can come honestly by them. Read <hi>1 Cor. 7. 21, 22, 23.</hi> with <hi>Dr. Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond's</hi>

               </gap> Obedience by any means, even when the lawful Magistrate persecuted him, if it were in an unlawful way, but he stood upon his Birth-right. For did not he in one place, awe the Centurion and chief Captain, <note place="margin">Acts 22. 25, 26, &amp;c.</note> and make all the Souldiers vanish who were commanded to beat him, by telling them he was a <hi>Roman?</hi> And did not he, in another place, bring the Magistrates of <hi>Philippi,</hi> one of the chief Cities of <hi>Macedonia,</hi> upon their Knees, when they had illegally beaten him, <note place="margin">Acts 16. 39.</note> without a fair Trial, by telling them he was a <hi>Roman?</hi> Although it is very plain, that <note place="margin">Vers. 21.</note> he, and <hi>Silas,</hi> who suffered with him, had really offended as they were accused, and were guilty of breaking the Roman Laws, yet St. <hi>Paul</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Vers. 47.</note> insists upon this, that they were <hi>uncondem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</hi> It were easie to produce many more pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages to the same purpose. And then as for the Laws of the Land, That Doctrine overthrows <hi>Magna Charta, Chap. 29.</hi> together with mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes of Statutes and ruled Cases; which, as I cannot stand here to name, so I need not, they are so well known. Only I will set down one Case, for the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> of it, which comprises in it more than all that I have said.</p>
            <p>In the Circuit of <hi>Northampton,</hi> when the Lord <hi>Anderson</hi> and <hi>Glanvile</hi> were Justices of Assize, a Pursivant was sent by the Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioners to arrest the Body of a man to appear be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them; and in resistance of the Arrest, and striving amongst them, the Pursivant was kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led: And if this was Murder or not, was <note place="margin">Coke's <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports 12th par.</hi> p. 49.

                  <hi>part.</hi> p. 15.</note> doubted, and this depended upon the validity of Power, and authority of the Pursivant: for if his authority was lawful, then in killing of an Officer of Justice in execution of his Office, is Murder: And advisement was taken till the


<pb n="viii" facs="tcp:47487:5"/>
next Assizes; and upon Conference, at the next <note place="margin">The Resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all the Judges.</note> Assizes, it was resolved, that the Arrest was <hi>Tortius,</hi> and by consequence that this was not Murder. The Pursivant was a proper Officer of the High Commission Court, he was sent by the Court to make this Arrest, it was one of the Powers of their Commission to send for any by Pursivant, &amp;c. And yet because this Power had no foundation upon the Act, <hi>1. Eliz.</hi> upon which their Commission was grounded, it could not justifie the Arrest, and consequently the Pursivant's Blood was upon his own Head. For as every Subject ought to be, and therefore is supposed to be connusant of the Law, much more ought they to be, who have any part in the execution of it. Now any man may see, that my Discourse does not descend to any such petty Matters as false Arrests, (though a Man's Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty is not to be despised neither) but I have honest'y and legally parsued the end of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our's coming into the World, which, as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self witnesses, was, not <hi>to destroy Men's</hi>

And to conclude, That Doctrine quite alters our Oath of Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and gives us new Measures of Obedience, whereas the old ones are these. <hi>I shall be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient to all the King's Majesty's Laws,</hi>

            <p>And then after all, that the case of a Pagan Successor might not seem remote and foreign, and nothing of kin to Popery, I found it neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary to make a short comparison of both those Religions; which though an unfinish'd Piece,

But still there are Worthies enough left, who were excluders with a witness, for they were for excluding <hi>Mary</hi> Queen of Scots, the next Heir to the Crown, not only from the Succession, but out of the World. As you may see by their Writing, intituled, <hi>Reasons to</hi>

               <hi>prove the Queen's Majesty bound in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science to proceed with severity in this Case of the late Queen of</hi> Scots. Some of which I will here set down, only to invite the Reader to peruse the whole Paper.</p>
            <p>Every good Prince ought, by God's <note place="margin">Pag. 208.</note> Commandment, to punish even with Death, all such as do seek to seduce the people of God from his true Worship unto Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition and Idolatry. For that Offence God hath always most grievously punished, as committed against the First Table, <hi>Deut.</hi> 13. His words are these; <hi>If thy Brother, the Son of thy Mother, or thine own Son, or thy Daughter,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Here you may perceive that God willeth his Magistrate not to spare either Brother or Sister, Son or Daughter, Wife or Friend, be he never so nigh, if he seek to seduce the People of God from his true Worship, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>But the late Queen of <hi>Scots</hi> hath not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly sought and wrought, by all means she can, to seduce the people of God in this Realm from true Religion; but is the only hope of all the Adversaries of God through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all <hi>Europe,</hi> and the instrument where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they trust to overthrow the Gospel of Christ in all Countries. And therefore if she have not that punishment which God in this place aforementioned appointeth; it is of all Christian Hearts to be fear'd, that God's just Plague will light both upon the Magistrates and Subjects:


<pb n="xii" facs="tcp:47487:7"/>
but that by our slackness and remiss Justice we give occasion of the overthrow of God's Glory and Truth in his Church, mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifully restored unto us in these latter days.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Constantinus Magnus</hi> caused <hi>Licinius</hi> to be <note place="margin">Eusebius <hi>Life of</hi> Const. lib. 2.</note> put to Death, being not his Subject but his Fellow-Emperor, for that the said <hi>Licinius</hi> laboured to subvert Christian Religion. And the same <hi>Constantinus</hi> is for the same in all Histories highly commended. Much more shall it be lawful for the Queen's Majesty to execute this Woman, who besides the subversion of Religion, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>A Prince ought in Conscience, before God, by all the means he can, to see to the Quietness, Safety, and good Estate of that people over which God hath appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him Governour.</p>
            <p>—Therefore as the Queen's Majesty indeed is mereiful, so we most humbly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire her, that she will open her Mercy to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God's people and her good Subjects, in dispatching those Enemies that seek the Confusion of God's Cause amongst us, and of this noble Realm.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But haply it may be, that some do discredit these Reasons by the Persons, when they cannot by the Matter; and will put in her Majesty's mind, that we in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suading her, respect our own danger &amp; fear of Peril coming to us, and not right and true Judgment: Yea, and that it may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear very unseemly and worthy sharp re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof in a Bishop to excite a Prince to Cruelty and Blood, contrary to her merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Inclination.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Resp.</hi> As touching the first Branch; sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly we see not any great continuance of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger likely to come unto us, more than to


<pb n="xiii" facs="tcp:47487:7"/>
all good Subjects while this State standeth; and the State cannot lightly alter, without the certain Peril both of our Prince and Country. Now if our Danger be joyned with the Danger of our Gracious Sovereign, and Natural Country, we see not how we can be accounted Godly Bishops, or Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Subjects, if in common Peril we should not cry and give warning: Or on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther side, how they can be thought to have true Hearts towards God, and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards their Prince and Country, that will mislike us for so doing, and seek thereby to discredit us.</p>
            <p>As touching the second Branch; God forbid that we should be Instruments to incense a merciful Prince to Cruelty and Bloodiness; neither can we think well of them, or judge that they have true mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Hearts, that in the Minister of God and Officer, do term Justice and right Punishment by the name of Bloodiness and Cruelty. God I trust in time, shall open her <hi>Majesty's</hi> Eyes to see and espy their cruel Puposes under the Cloak of extolling Mercy, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Here you see how urgent they are with the Queen, contrary to her inclination, to put Queen <hi>Mary</hi> to death, who did not suffer till thirteen years after; and how they mak thedan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerousness of her Religion, and the hopes which the Papists had conceived of ruining the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant Religion, by her means, not only suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, but necessary Reasons for so doing. A Bill of Exclusion is perfect Courtship to these Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons. Let those therefore that run down three successive Houses of Commons for that Bill, turn their Fury and Reproaches, with more justice up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on these old <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, and we have done. And


<pb n="xiv" facs="tcp:47487:8"/>
let them likewise give us but one Reason to provs a Bill of Exclusion to be unlawful, which they will own to be a Reason a week af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and not be ashamed of it, and I do solemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly promise to joyn with them in renouncing these Old Reformers, and will hereafter readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly follow their new Guides and new Light.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, because I see hearty Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants abused to their Ruin, with shameful So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phistry, I think it the part of every honest man to detect it. And the most popular Argument is this; You are preingaged, and cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to a Bill of Exclusion; for if you do, you are forsworn, because you have long since sworn Allegiance to the King, and to his lawful Heirs and Successors. Now though the Lawyers tell them, an hundred times over, <hi>No man can have an Heir while he is alive;</hi> yet this will not overcome that deceitful Prejudice which is occasioned by our common Speech; where a man and his Heirs are contempory, and familiarly live at once in the same House, and eat and drink together every day. Where likewise Heir Apparent sounds as a greater addition to Heir, and Heir Presumptive sounds as somewhat a less addition, and few are capable of considering them as terms of Diminution. No more than on the other hand, a Papist can be persuaded that Images are Idols, because there common speech has made a distinction, where really there is none, as the <hi>Homily</hi> well observes: Whereas <note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 words">
                     <desc>〈◊◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>. <hi>p. 13.</hi>
               </note> here it has confounded an actual Heir with one that is only in possibility. What is to be done then? Shall we shew them, that the Duty of Excise, for instance, is granted to the King, his Heirs and Successors; in which it is plain, that Heirsand Successors have not any title to a Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny while his Majesty lives, which God grant may be long, to keep them a great while from


<pb n="xv" facs="tcp:47487:8"/>
it. Why, still it may be replied, that Heirs and Successors may have this Law sense in an Act of Parliament, but an Oath of Allegiance ought to be conceived in plain words, and to be taken in the common sense of those words, without any Jesuitical Equivocation. Well, if it be so, then let them be sure to keep it in that sense in which they have taken it, or should have taken it by sixteen Years of Age, in the <hi>Court-Leet,</hi> in these words; <hi>This hear you, the Steward and the Court, that I shall swear, That I will be true Liege-man, and true Faith and Troth bear to our Soveraign Lord the King that now is, and to his High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness Heirs and lawful Successors, Kings or Queens of this Realm of</hi> England, <hi>and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his Dominions depending on the same,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Whereby it is plain to every body, that no one certain or known Person in the World, has any interest at present in the Oath of Allegiance, besides his Majesty that now is: for who shall be King or Queen of this Realm of <hi>England</hi> hereafter, none but God himself knows.</p>
            <p>Another Argument I have heard, which is fetch'd from the <hi>Common-Prayer,</hi> That no Church of <hi>England-man</hi> can, with a good Conscience, be for a Bill of Exclusion, which they say is to the prejudice of his R. H. because we there pray, That <hi>God would prosper him with all happiness,</hi> both here and hereafter. There is no man in the Communion of the Church of <hi>England</hi> that prayes that Prayer more hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily than I do. But it would be a Curse, either in the Mouth, or in the Heart of any Protestant, under the name of Happiness, to wish him the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, and which is more, the invincible Temptation, and a kind of Necessity, to extir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate


<pb n="xvi" facs="tcp:47487:9"/>
the best Religion in the World. That, I am sure, would be far from promoting his hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness in the next World, and I am apt to think, will contribute nothing at all to it in this. He that prays that Prayer with understanding, prays for his R. H's return to the Protestant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion: which would both prove an unspeaka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble blessing to himself, and restore these three Kingdoms to be the happiest upon Earth. It would be some comfort if we could but hope for such a thing. But if the D. is perswaded that he has made a better choice, it were very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirable, but not unless it stand with his H's good likeing, that he would injoy that Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion to the greatest advantage, and take his fill of it at the Fountain-head, which a Crown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Head at this instant does, who could not enjoy it so happily at home. And the rather, because all Protestants are sworn not to suffer <hi>Rome</hi> to come hither. For I am throughly satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and so may any Man else, by once looking upon them, that the Oath of Allegiance and Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy, are Protestant Oaths, (as a great asserter of Religion and Laws, now with God, thought fit to term them) and we shamefully and wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly break them, unless to our power we keep out Popery. And the Oath of Supremacy, being often called in Statutes, the <hi>Oath of Obedience,</hi> we are bound, by virtue of our Religion, of our Oath, and of our Obedience, which are strong Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations, to oppose the entrance of Popery into this Kingdom.</p>
            <p>And I am afraid it is a vain undertaking to go about, by Law, to twist a Popish Interest with these Oaths, when both our Religion, and our sworn Obdience, engage us to oppose it. For in any case that can be put, whether it be fit to obey Man, or God and Man too, judge ye. <hi>Julian</hi> endeavoured to entangle the Christians, and to destroy Christianity that


<pb n="xvii" facs="tcp:47487:9"/>
very way. There was a Law, and an Ancient Law of the Empire, (and so great stress was laid upon it, that the breach of it was look'd upon as an Offence against the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and the Empire) that every one should ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and worship the Emperor's Statues and Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures; which were set up for that end in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Places. Now he took advantage of that Law to ensnare them unawares in Heathenish Worship, for he added the Figures of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then <note place="margin">Invect. 1. <hi>p.</hi> 83, 84.</note> Gods to his own Picture, and as <hi>Grego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry's</hi> words are, <hi>mingled Poyson with their Meat,</hi> abusing their Loyalty to the Purposes of Idolatry. For this was his project, as <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zomen</hi>

               </note> tells us, He concluded, that if he could bring over the Christians to this, he might the more easily attempt any thing else that he had a mind to; but if he found them disobedient, then to punish them without Mercy, as innovating in the Roman Customs, and offending against the Government and the Empire. A few therefore, who were also punished, understood the Cheat, &amp; would not worship according to custom. Who they were, S. <hi>Gregory</hi> tells us, some of the wiser <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> and more conscientious found out the fraud, but they paid for their sagacity; the pretence was, that they offended against the Honour of the Emperor; but the truth was, they came into danger for the sake of the true King, and for the sake of Religion. But the multitude, as they use to do, from ignorance, or an unthink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mind, simply thought they obeyed an Old Law, and more simply approached these Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges. But what says <hi>Gregory</hi> of this sort that <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Sozom.</hi> ibid. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> obeyed the old Law? Who perhaps, says he, may obtain pardon for their Ignorance, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hurried into Wickedness by a Wile. He makes a doubt of it, but he would have readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pronounced concerning their Pardon, who


<pb n="xviii" facs="tcp:47487:10"/>
wink hard &amp; are wilful. Now if a Prince puts a Border of Popery (which some say is ten times worse than a Border of Paganism) about his Picture, which we fain would honour and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence, and once did, before we saw that unhappy addition, what shall we say, or what can we do?</p>
            <p>In these afflicting Thoughts, I had almost for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got a Matter of great Consequence, and that is <note place="margin">Aug. <hi>in Ps.</hi> 124. Julianus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titit infidelis Imperator, &amp;c.</note> a passage of St. <hi>Austin,</hi> which rises up against all that we have said concerning the behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our of the Christians towards <hi>Julian,</hi> and is. to this effect. That the Christian Souldiers ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved under this Infidel Emperor, and where their Religion was not concern'd, made Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science of obeying him; but where indeed it came to the Cause of Christ, there they made as much Conscience of disobeying him.</p>
            <p>Now the Reader may please to take notice, that the whole Contest which I have described betwixt these Christians and <hi>Julian</hi> was purely upon the score of Religion, and not from any lawless or ungovernable humour. And as for these Souldiers fighting under <hi>Julian</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the <hi>Persians,</hi> or other common Enemies of the Empire, (far as sure as they were Christians, they would never have drawn a Sword to destroy their fellow Christians, or the Interest of Christianity) and obeying the Word of Command, when they received his pay, it is such a low part of Honesty, that any man may pretend to it. If I had been there, a Souldier of Fortune, I should have done the same: and which is more, would have lost my own Life, rather than have served him that slippery trick in <hi>Persia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the Christians obeying <hi>Julian</hi> in indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Matters, which did not concern their


<pb n="xix" facs="tcp:47487:10"/>
Religion, puts me in mind of a more famous Compliance amongst themselves. Every Body knows how the Church was rent in sunder by Arrianism, and there might be too much stif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and rigidness on the other hand about Words, for ought I know, but miserably rent it was; which gave <hi>Julian</hi> great advantage against the Christian Religion.</p>
            <p>Now what did the Christians do? Did the Orthodox go and side with <hi>Julian,</hi> to revenge the Injuries which they had received from the Arrians in <hi>Constantius's</hi> Time; or make use of <hi>Julian's</hi> Favour which he shewed in resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring them, to crush their Brethren which dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered from them? No, there was no seeking to him by either side; only the Donatists of <hi>Africk</hi> complemented him, and received some small fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours from him, but they were made infamous by it. <hi>Honorius</hi> the Emperor posted them for it all over the Empire very many Years after, and St. <hi>Austin</hi> is often teazing them for it in the next Generation. <note place="margin">

            <p>The same Historian has a notable passage to the same purpose in <hi>Jovian's</hi> Life, who succeed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Julian;</hi> and who, by the way, when he was chosen Emperor by the unanimous consent of the whole Army, refused it, saying he was a Christian and would not be the Emperor of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans: The Army on the other hand, begg'd of him not to decline the Government of them as a wicked Government, for they were all Christians too; upon which he accepted the

They both made so good progress in Learning, that they entred into Orders, so as to read the Scriptures to the People, thinking this no diminution to them, but that Piety was the greatest Ornament. The one of them was sincerely pious, though <note place="margin">Ibid. <hi>p.</hi> 58. 59.</note> hot and fierce in his Nature; but the other redeeming the time, hid his wicked Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per under a Masque of Gentleness.</p>

And he met with a Man that promised to fortel him these things; who led him into an Idol Temple, and there initiated him;

                  </note> at that time. For before this, in his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Time, <hi>Asia</hi> was <hi>Julian's</hi> School of Impiety, for Astronomy, and Nativities, and the vanity of Prognosticating, and that which follows these, Magick; and he want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed nothing but Power to add to his Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. And before that, <hi>Gregory</hi> concludes, that he was a concealed Pagan, when he dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> hard with his Brother in favour of the Heathens, and pretended, that he only tried how he could hold the weaker side of a Question. Which agrees with what him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Julian</hi> Ep. 51.</note> writes to the <hi>Alexandrians,</hi> when he was Emperor. He advises them not to worship Jesus, as God the Word, whom neither they nor their Fathers ever saw; but the great Sun, which from Eternity all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind do see, and behold, and worship, which is the living, and animated, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding, and bountiful Image of the Intelligible Father; if they would be ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by him, who had tried both Religions; who had lived twenty Years in their Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and was now onwards of twelve in this. However the Fathers all agree, that the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion of his revolt from Christianity, was from a thirst of Empire; and from consul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his Heathen <hi>Gadbury's</hi> about it; for <hi>Sozomon</hi> tells us, That no Christian was to <note place="margin">

nor the Emperor himself, who was now perfectly reconciled to him, and sent for him from <hi>Athens,</hi> and made him <hi>Caesar;</hi> and as the greatest Pledge of his sincere Affection, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Socrat.</hi> l. 3. c. 1.</note> gave him his Sister <hi>Helena</hi> to wife, and gave him the command of an Army, against some of the Northern barbarous People who had invaded <hi>France. Julian</hi> indeed was jealous of this sudden advancement, and look'd upon it as grinning Honour; and in <hi>Homer's</hi> words, at that very time called it, <gap reason="foreign">

In <hi>France</hi> he was very suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessful, and routed the Enemy; and having got the Hearts of the Common Souldiers, by giving them Mony, they declared him Emperor. Thus <hi>Julian</hi> began to Reign; and after he had changed the Magistrates in every Province, and traduced <hi>Constantius</hi> in every City where he came, and having en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased his Numbers, with those that revol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from <hi>Constantius,</hi> he openly laid afide his Hypocrisy of Christianizing, and mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches with his Army for <hi>Constantinople.</hi> His <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Greg.</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vect. 1. <hi>p.</hi> 67, 68.</note> pretence was, that he came to excuse his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made Emperor; but in truth it was to wrest the whole Empire out of <hi>Constantius's</hi> hands.

                     <hi>Ruffinus</hi> l. 1. c. 26.</note> meet him; but fell sick and died in <hi>Cilicia.</hi> If this fatal Blow had not happened to the Christians, <hi>Gregory</hi> concludes, That <hi>Julian</hi>

               </p>
               <p>The first thing he did when he came to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> was to change his Court; <q>By putting to death some, and banishing <note place="margin">

               <p>Having thus setled himself in his Throne, and made the Army sure to him, he began

to discover his Malice against the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans. <q>For before this he stood in fear of the <note place="margin">Ib. <hi>cap.</hi> 3.</note> Souldiers, who were Men principled in the true Religion. First of all, the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous <hi>Constantine</hi> having freed them from their former Errors, instructed them throughly in the Doctrine of Truth; and after this his Sons confirmed them in it. For though <hi>Constantius,</hi> at the Instigation of others, rejected the word <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, yet he sincerely confess'd the meaning of it: For he called the Genuine Son, who was begotten of the Father before all Worlds, God the VVord. <hi>Julian</hi> know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing these things very well, did not disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the wickedness of his Heart, nor as yet make any Laws against the Christians.</q> Nay, he charged the People, That they <note place="margin">

               <p>They suffered, notwithstanding, very much in this Interval, as well as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  <q>Hear, O thou Soul of <hi>Constantius</hi> the Great, (if you can hear at all what we say) and the Souls of all Christian Kings before him; but his especially, for as much as having grown up with the Inheritance of Christ, and enlarged it to his Power, and establish'd it by a long continuace, so as to be upon this account the most re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned of all the Kings that ever were, (O the mischief of it!) he committed a gross mistake very unworthy of his own Plety: Not being aware of it, he bred up for the Christians an Enemy of Christ. And he did amiss to be good-natured in this Instance only, in saving and making him a King, who was both ill-saved, and made an ill King. And for this reason he is likely to be most delighted, as with the Destruction of Impiery, and the Restora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Christianity, so likewise with this Speech.</q> Which in the next words he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicates to God, as a Thanksgiving Oration, and a Sacrifice of Praise; so solemn it is. Now here is enough to shew that <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> would never have made <hi>Julian, Caesar,</hi> nor have set up an Enemy of Christ over

               <p>But the same Father will give us better Measure in another place, in these words; <q>

What have you done, O divinest Emperor, and greatest lover of Christ!

               <p>To this Accusation of this good Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, he presently subjoins an Apology, and shews at last, that what he did was through Ignorance; <q>For who could be ignorant, even of those that knew him but indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently, how that for the sake of Religion, and for the Love and good VVill he bare to us, he not only would have neglected him, or the Honour of his whole Family, or the Addition of an Empire; but also that he would have made no difficulty of part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with his very Empire, and all things he had in the VVorld, and his Life it self (than which no Man has any thing more precious) for our Security and Safety.</q> And after a great deal more to the same purpose, he says thus; <q>But simplicity and plain-heartedness are not watchful, and weakness is joyned with good Nature; and who are freest from VVickedness, least suspect it. For this reason, what would come afterwards, was not known, and the Masque was not discovered.</q>

               <p>In this remakable Passage, we have all this for our present purpose.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That the making of <hi>Julian</hi> a <hi>Caesar,</hi> (by which means he had an easy Passage to the Crown, for it was the next step to it) was a rash, foolish, and inconsiderate Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; that it was cruel and inhumane, and fit only for some Devil to advise.</p>
               <p n="2">2 That the Fault and Mischief of this Action, was not because he usurp'd after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards upon <hi>Constantius,</hi> or upon any other Consideration whatsoever, bnt purely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Christian Religion suffered by it.</p>
               <p>

                  <pb n="18" facs="tcp:47487:22"/>
And. 3. That <hi>Constantius</hi> can be no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise excused than by his ignorance of <hi>Julian's</hi> defection from Christianity.</p>
               <p>And all this not nakedly set down, and coldly delivered, but with an Emphasis, and the greatest vehemency imaginable. He does not say, <hi>Constantius</hi> was to blame for this; but he calls him to account for it, he follows him with Interrogatories, and bids him answer from Heaven what he has done. He does not barely say, That if <hi>Constantius</hi> had known <hi>Julian's</hi> Religion, he would not have made him <hi>Caesar;</hi> but he fays, that he would have disinherited his whole Family first, he would have parted with his Empire, he would have strip'd himself of all, and lost his Life rather than have done it. And according we find, that as soon as <hi>Constantius</hi> understood his Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, he bitterly bewailed it, which was just at his Death. He could not know it much sooner; For after <hi>Julian</hi> was decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Emperor, and had set up for himself, as <hi>Ammianus</hi> tells us, <note place="margin">

                  <q>He still seigned himself a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian. And though in private he performed his Heathenish Rites trusting some few with the secert, yet he publickly went to Church on <hi>Twelfth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day,</hi> and after he had been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout at the Service, he came away again.</q> This was at <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enna,</hi> not quite ten Months be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Emperor's Death.</p>
               <p>To return to what we were speaking of before, <hi>Gregory</hi> says, That <hi>Constantius</hi> made his excuse in many words, both to God and Man, for his kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to <hi>Julian;</hi> and shewed the Christians,


<pb n="19" facs="tcp:47487:22"/>
with much earnestness, the Concernment he had for the true Religion. This he did at his last gasp, when otherwise it was all one to him who had the Empire, for he had done with it. And in another place, and upon a different occasion, he has these words. <q>They report <hi>Constantius</hi> repented him at his last breath, when every Man is a just Judg of himself, because of the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunal, which is in the other World; for <note place="margin">Orat. in laud. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thanasii,</hi> p. 389.</note> these three things he acknowledged were evil and unworthy of his Reign; the slaughter of his Kindred, and his decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the Apostate, and his innovating in Matters of Faith. And with these words in his Mouth he is said to have gone out of the World. </q>This is ten times more than if <hi>Constantius</hi> had actually excluded <hi>Juli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi> for he might have done that, and been sorry for it at his Death; as Men generally are for all the Actions of their Life, in which they are not satisfied. But now he repents him upon his Death-bed, where Men's Eyes are open, and they usually have their sobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest Thoughts about them, that he had not done it, and reckons it in the number of those things which have blackned his Reign.</p>
               <p>This was the old fashion'd Doctrine of <hi>Gregory Nazienzen,</hi> who alone, except St. <hi>John,</hi> has had the Honour to be called <hi>the Divine;</hi> this was the sense of <hi>Basil</hi> the <note place="margin">Invect. 2. <hi>p.</hi> 132.</note> Great, for <hi>Gregory</hi> entitles him likewise to these Invectives; and this was the Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of a Dying Emperor. If this Doctrine shall displease any of those Men. who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving, and being deceived, say, That the Succession cannot be altered, which is pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishable by the Laws of the Land; or that it ought not to be altered for the safety and security of true Religion, which is contrary


<pb n="20" facs="tcp:47487:23"/>
to what these Fathers assert with so much vehemency: In that case I have these two reasonable Requests to make to them.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That they would please to consute this Doctrine which they dislike, and prove it false.</p>
               <p>And then, 2. that they would never hereafter fetch their Mountebank Receipts of Prayers and Tears, and such like En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements <note place="margin">For even Scripture, not half so much abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, these men them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves call <hi>Cant.</hi>
                  </note> to Arbitrary Government, of which I shall say more anon, out of the Writings of these very Fathers; but let them pass from hence-forth for dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous and Anti-monarchial Authors. Whom we can the better spare at this time, because the whole Christian World was of the same mind. Which, by the way, <hi>Julian</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">This <hi>Am.

Nay, the Christians had such an aversion to a Pagan Successor, that they could not endure him, when he was become their lawful Emperor.</p>
               <p>How fond they were of him, and what welcome they gave him to the Crown, and in how great heaviness they were at his Death, shall appear at large in the following Chapters.</p>

               <p>ANd here a Man may almost lose him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self in the great variety of Instances, which may be given of their Hatred and Contempt of <hi>Julian,</hi> when he was Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror.

he had not got out of the way; prayed for his Confusion, and triumphed at his Death, and loaded his Memory with the greatest Disgrace and Infamy. These things will better be seen in the History and Relation of the Matter of Fact: which I shall put into the best order I can, by giving an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of what was done in his Life-time, and then all that concerns his Death, and after that, how they used his Memory.</p>
               <p>Their Behaviour in his Life-time, will fall under these three Heads, of their <hi>Words,</hi> and <hi>Actions,</hi> and <hi>Devotions.</hi> I shall begin with the first of these, where <hi>Julian</hi> began with them. And they sufficiently requited him for calling them <hi>Galileans,</hi> for they named him <hi>Idolianus</hi> instead of <hi>Julianus,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Invect. 1. <hi>p.</hi> 82.</note> and <hi>Pisaeus,</hi> and <hi>Adonaeus,</hi> from his wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipping of <hi>Jupiter</hi> and <hi>Adonis,</hi> and <hi>Bull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burner,</hi> from the great number of them which he sacrificed. The <hi>Antiochians</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded in this kind of despiteful usage, and chafed him into the revengeful humour of writing a Book against them, which has preserved the memory of those Indignities which they put upon him. They derided the shape of his Body, his Gate, his Goat's Beard, every thing that belonged to him, as you may see in the very beginning of that <note place="margin">Julian Misopogon. <hi>p. 88.</hi>
                  </note> Book. And afterwards he tells them they were very happy Men, who had renounced all service, either of the Gods, or Laws, or him who was keeper of the Laws; and that the Gods, as well as he, had suffered dishonour from that City. It was a say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing among them, that <hi>Chi</hi> and <hi>Cappa</hi> had never done any injury to their City; by which Letters they meant Christ and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantius.</hi>

And after his Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory, he designed the ruin of the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and threatned to set up the Idol of <hi>Venus</hi> in the Christian Churches. March<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on with these Threatnings, he was over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come by one single Man in <hi>Beraea:</hi> This Man was indeed in other respects an emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Person, for he was Governour there; but his Zeal made him more eminent. For seeing his Son warping towards the false Religion, which then prevailed, he turned him out of Doors, and publickly disinheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him. But he coming to the Emperor, who was but one Stage from the City, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared to him, both his own Perswasion, and how his Father had disinherited him. <hi>Julian</hi> bid the young Man set his Heart at rest, promising that he would reconcile his Father to him. So when he came to <hi>Beraea,</hi> he invited the Magistrates, and chief Men, to a feast, and amongst these was this young Man's Father; and him, with his


<pb n="24" facs="tcp:47487:25"/>
Son, he ordered to sit next himself. And about the middle of Dinner, <hi>Julian</hi> says to the Father; In my mind it is not just to force a Man's Judgment, which is other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise inclined, and to reduce it, against his Will, to the other side. Therefore do not you force your Son, against his mind, to follow your Opinion. For neither do I force you to follow mine, although I can very easily compel you. But the Father, sharpnening his Discourse with a Divine Faith, answered, O King, do you speak of this Villain, who is hated by God, and has preferr'd a Lie before the true Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? But, says <hi>Julian,</hi> putting on again a Vizard of Meekness; Friend, leave Rail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and, turning his Face to the young Man, he said, I will take care of you my self, since I have not prevailed with your Father to do it.</q>

                  <p>I have not told this Story in vain, (says <hi>Theodoret</hi>) but was willing to shew, not only the admirable freedom of this Divine Person, but also that there were very many who despised <hi>Julian's</hi> Power and Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>

                        <hi>Theod</hi> l. 3. c. 15.</note> of Dignity and Authority, using the like boldness (as <hi>Juventinus</hi> and <hi>Maximus</hi> did) enjoyed equal Crowns. For <hi>Valen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinian</hi> himself, who was afterwards Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror, but was then a Colonel of the Houshold Guards, did not hide the Zeal which he had for the true Religion. For when that Thunder-struck Mad-man went in Procession to the Temple of <hi>Fortune,</hi> the Chaplains stood on both sides of the Doors, cleansing, as they counted it, with Sprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, or Holy Water, that those entred


<pb n="26" facs="tcp:47487:26"/>
in. But when <hi>Valentinian,</hi> who gained both Kingdoms, of Earth and Heaven, for what he now did, walking before the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror, saw this Holy Water coming near his Cloaths; he struck the Chaplain with his Fist, saying, that it would not cleanse, but defile him. <hi>Julian</hi> seeing what passed, sent him away to a Garison lying by a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sart, and gave order that there he should spend his days. But in a Year, and a few-Months time, he was made Emperor, in reward of his Confession. For the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Judg, not only rewards those that are concerned for Religion in the Life to come, but sometimes he presently gives them the recompence of their pious Labours, by these previous Gifts now, confirming the belief of those which Christians hope for hereafter.</q>
               </p>
               <p>You see how <hi>Theodoret</hi> magnifies this Action; and though it was so high a breach of the Peace, as might have cost him his right Hand, if not his Head, in many Courts; yet he makes him no less than a Confessor for it.</p>
               <p>And so St. <hi>Austin</hi> calls him; <q>
                     <hi>Valenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>August.</hi> de Civit. <hi>l.</hi> 18. <hi>c.</hi> 52.</note> was a Confessor of the Christian Faith under <hi>Julian,</hi> and lost his place in the Guards for it.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Our next Instance, is a Passage of as great a Man in his way, and that is, Old <hi>Gregory</hi> Bishop of <hi>Nazianzum,</hi> Father to <hi>Gregory Nazianzen.</hi> We have it in the Funeral Speech or Sermon of the Divine upon his Father's Death; and after he has said a great deal in his praise, he has these <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Greg. Naz.</hi> O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat. 19. p. 307.</note> words: <q>But I suppose that some of them, who knew his Life very well, have won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred a good while, that I should be so taken up in these things aforesaid, as if I


<pb n="27" facs="tcp:47487:26"/>
had nothing else in commendation of him; and that I should make no mention of the difficulty of the Times, against which he seemed to have been set in battel aray. Come on then, and let me add these things to what has been said. Our Age bore such an Evil, as no Age did before, aud I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose none will hereafter, an Emperor that was an Apostate, both from God and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, who thought it a small Bursiness to conquer the <hi>Persians,</hi> but a great Work to reduce the Christians. And the Devils that drove him, perswading him to it, he omitted no manner of Impiety, by Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suasions, by Threatnings, Sophistry, draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over to him, not only those that he gained by Artifices, but those also which he forced by Violence. Now who is there to be found that more despised this Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, or had a greater hand in destroying him, than my Father? Of his contempt of him, amongst many other, both those Archers, and their Commander, are a proof, whom he brought against our Church; as either to take possession of it, or to destroy it: For having assaulted ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny others, he came hither likewise with the same intent, and imperiously demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Temple. He so far failed of accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishing any thing of what he desired; that if he had not presently got out of my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's way, (being aware of it, either of himself, or by some Bodies advice) he might have gone away kick'd; The Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop boyling with Anger against him, and  with Zeal for the Temple.</q>
               </p>
               <p>I have had more trouble with this Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage, than with all the rest in the Book. For I have often tried to make this seating intended for the Captain of the Archers, and


<pb n="28" facs="tcp:47487:27"/>
have been ready to make <hi>Solaecisms</hi> in the Greek, to avoid the greater <hi>Solaecism</hi> of an Emperor of the World, awed and terrified with the fear of a kicking. But it will not do: it is too late for me to consult <hi>Julian's</hi> Honour, or to alter <hi>Gregory's</hi> words.</p>
               <p>And that you may be satisfied this is the sense of them, I have here set down the Comment of a Metropolitan of <hi>Crete,</hi> who was a better Grecian than I ever expect to be.</p>

               <p>Here you have the description of one of the Lachrymists of old, who at fourscore and ten, and after he had been thirty five Years a Bishop, was an Over-match for a Pagan Emperor; and having vanquish'd him, and won the Field, kept it as long as he lived, which was about nine Years after <hi>Julian's</hi> Death. And which is more than that, The Garlands and Trophies of this Victory are hung up in the Church by the hands of another Bishop, to satisfy the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spectation of a number of good Christian People, <hi>Basil</hi> the Great assisting at the Ceremony.</p>
               <p>

And now know I no more than the Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi> what to make of all this, what they meant by it, or upon what Principles these Men proceeded. Whether the Laws of their Country allowed them (which I am sure the Laws of our Country do not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low a Man to imagine) to offer Violence to their lawful Emperor; or whether old <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory</hi> distinguish'd, and did not resist <hi>Julian,</hi> but only the Devil, which his Son so often tells us was in him; Or how it was, I will never stand guessing. Only this we may be assured of, that none of these Bishops had ever been in <hi>Scotland,</hi> nor had learn'd to fawn upon an Apostate, and a mortal Enemy to their Religion.</p>

Yes, so they do, the wrong way; they cannot sing a Psalm, but they make

his Confusion the Burden of it. And as they order the Matter, their Prayers and Tears are the Arms of the Church indeed, for they are Darts, and Arrows, and Fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brands, and Death. If moving all the Power, and solliciting all the Vegeance of Heaven against a Man; if calling for the Sword, and the Plagues of <hi>Egypt,</hi> be praying for their Pagan Emperor, they give him enough of that; as you shall see anon in their own words.</p>
               <p>I shall begin with their Psalms, which I shall set down so, as not to omit the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances I find with them.</p>

                     </gap> the Disgrace which was hereby put upon him, the next day commanded the Leaders of this Dance to be appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended. <hi>Salustius</hi> the Governor, who was himself an Heathen, dissuaded the Emperor from it; but when he saw that <hi>Julian</hi> could not contain his Passion, he went and seized the first which came to hand; which was <hi>Theodorus,</hi> a young Man, adorned with Divine Zeal, walking in the Market-place: Him he tortured from Morning to Night, with so much Cruelty, and so many fresh Executioners, as no Age has mentioned the like. And when he was upon the Wrack, and a Toiturer plying him on either side, he did nothing hut sing o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver again that Psalm, which the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation


<pb n="31" facs="tcp:47487:28"/>
sung the day before, with an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concerned  and chearful Countenance. </q>This made <hi>Ruffinus,</hi> who likewise tells this Story, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ruffinus,</hi> lib. 1. c. 36.</note> afterwards ask him whether he felt any pain? <q>Who said, that he felt a little, but there stood by him a certain Youth, who all the while wiped off his Sweat with a very white Linnen Cloth, and often poured cold Water upon him, which so delighted him, that he was sorry when he was taken off the Wrack. For when <hi>Salustius</hi> saw that he had spent all that Cruelty upon him to no purpose, he put Fetters upon him, and kept him in Prison. But he was soon released, and no Body else punish'd  upon that account.</q> 
                  <hi>Julian</hi> it seems did not care to have that Psalm any oftner re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated; which he might very reasonably expect, when so much Cruelty could not make a Youth to alter his Note.</p>
               <p>To this I shall only add, what <hi>Theodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret</hi> calls it, a memorable Story of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable Woman: <q>For even the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men <note place="margin">

Her Name was <hi>Publia,</hi> and she was Mother to <hi>John;</hi> who was often chosen to be Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of <hi>Antioch,</hi> but as often refused it. This Woman being a Widow, had a Quire of Virgins, which promised Virginity for LIfe, and was always singing Praises to God her Creator and Redeemer. And when the Emperor passed by, they sung their Psalms the louder, accounting him fit to be despised and derided. Now they sung, for the most part, those Psalms, which expose the weakness of Idols; and they said with <hi>David, The Idols of the Heathen are Silver and Gold, the Work of Men's Hands.</hi> And after they had shewed the


<pb n="32" facs="tcp:47487:29"/>
senslesness of them, they added; <hi>Let them that make them, be like unto them, and all those that put their trust in them!</hi> He hearing these things, was grievously vexed, and commanded them to be silent at such time as he passed by. But she, little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garding his Laws, put more courage into her Quire; and when he past by again, she bid them sing this Psalm, <hi>Let God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rise, and let his Enemies be scattered! Julian,</hi> in great indignation, commanded the Mistress of the Quire to be brought to him; and when he saw her venerable Age, he neither had any compassion for her Years, nor honoured her Vertue, but commanded one of the Souldiers to strike her on the Face, till he made it all bloody with his hands. She receiving this Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace, as the highest Honour, went back to her House; but she still shot him with  her Spiritual Songs as she was wont.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Now here indeed is a Suffering Religion, because the old Woman does not beat the Souldier; but I cannot possibly find out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny profound Primitive Obedience in this passage. Where is the Reverence due to Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty, or Eternity, as Emperors were then stiled, in courting him fit to be made a Laughing-stock? What dutifulness was there shewn, in refusing to comply with so reasonable a Command, as to forbear <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> Psalms only when he went by? But it was <hi>Julian,</hi> and they did not owe him so much Service. They say, Rage turns every thing into Weapons, and there seems to be some quantity of that Passion here, when their very Devotions are so plainly aimed and level'd at <hi>Julian's</hi> Head.</p>

               <p>I Come now to their <hi>Prayers and Tears,</hi> of which <hi>Gregory</hi> gives us a large ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.

However it is very evident, that their publick Devotions ran in the same strain.</p>
               <p>In the forementioned Oration, at his Father's Funeral, you may remember that <hi>Gregory</hi> praises him for his contempt of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian,</hi> of which we gave you an account be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; and for contributing to his destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.

               </p>
               <p>In this place he does not specify what those publick Prayers were which they had for <hi>Julian,</hi> but he sufficiently describes them.</p>
               <p>First, They were such as tended to his Destruction, and were a means of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>2dly,</hi> They darted these Prayers at him. It is exprest by a word, which might more properly be employed to describe the throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

               <p>
                  <hi>3dly,</hi> The nightly Squadron mentioned aster, confirms us, that with these they fought him by day.</p>
               <p>And, <hi>4thly,</hi> They were such Prayers as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed old <hi>Gregory</hi> to a great deal of danger; but he did not fear the Times a crumb.</p>
               <p>If ever the Christians were in cold Blood, sure they were at old <hi>Gregory's</hi> Funeral, for it was several Years after <hi>Julian's</hi> Death: And yet you see, that even then his opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to <hi>Julian</hi> serves to embalm his Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. It was thought to be so much for his honour, to help to pray <hi>Julian</hi> to Death, that a great part of the Congregation had been disappointed, if no mention had been made of it; as appears plainly from the Preface to this Passage before cited. So that in that Age the best Prayers and Tears were those, which did best execution upon an Apostate Emperor, and contributed most to his destruction. Which now follows to be spoken of in the next Chapter.</p>

For, says he, the Creator of the World, whom you in derision have called <hi>Carpenter's Son,</hi> is makings a Coffin. And in a few days after came  the news of that wicked Wretch's Death.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Which was likewise revealed in as extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary a manner to St. <hi>Julian Sabba.</hi> 
                  <q>Who having understood the Threatnings of that wicked One against the Christians, did more diligently offer up his Prayers to the God of the whole World. And on that day the Emperor was killed, this Person be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at Prayers knew, of it; although he was more than twenty days Journeys off. For, they say, as he was supplicating the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful and compassionate Lord, on a sudden he stop'd the current of his Tears, and was filled with Joy, which discovered it self in the chearfulness of his Countenance. They that conversed with him, seeing this change in him, desired to know the occasion of it. And he told them, that the wild Bore, the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy of the Lord's Vineyard, had suffered the panishment of his Faults, and lay dead, having done designing. When they heard these things, they all fell a dancing, and offered up to God an Hymn of Thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving. And they understood, by those that


<pb n="37" facs="tcp:47487:31"/>
brought advice of his Death, that it was the same day, and the same hour, in which this Divine old Man, both knew the Wretch  to be slain, and spoke of it before-hand.</q>
               </p>
               <p>And thus the News, as fast as it arrived, was every-where entertained with all the demonstrations of joy and gladness. His old Friends, <q>The <hi>Antiochians,</hi> as soon as they heard of his Death, kept Feasts, and <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Theod.</hi> lb. c. 22.</note> publick joyful Meetings; and they not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly  had Dances in their Churches and Chappels of the Martyrs, but likewise in their Theatre they proclaimed the Victory of the Cross, crying aloud, with one Voice,  <hi>God and his Christ have gotten the Victory.</hi> 
                  </q>In a word, the whole Church sung Songs of Triumph, as St. <hi>Jerome</hi> tells us, in his Comment upon the third of <hi>Habakkak.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Because it was not known who threw that Spear which killed him, it gave occasion to variety of Reports. <q>Some say he was kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by a <hi>Persian;</hi> but the more general and prevailing Report, is, That he was kill'd by one of his own Souldiers; <hi>as</hi> Socrates's <hi>words are.</hi> But <hi>Callistus,</hi> who was then in <hi>Julian's</hi> Service, and has given us the History of that War in Hero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ick Verse, says, it was a <hi>Daemon</hi> that did <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Socrat</hi> l. 3. c. 21.</note> it. Which it may be he feigned as a Poet, and it may be was the truth of the Matter,  for the Furies have punished very many.</q> And so <hi>Theodoret</hi> after him. <q>Who it was <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Theod.</hi> l. 3. c. 20.</note> that struck that just stroak, no Body knows to this day. But whether it was Man or Angel that thrust the Weapon, it is plain that he who did it, was the Minister of the Divine Appointment and Direction.</q>
               </p>
               <p>But <hi>Libanius</hi> the Sophist, whom <hi>Julian</hi> in his Letters to him, calls his <hi>Dearest Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> is resolved to find out the Man that


<pb n="38" facs="tcp:47487:32"/>
kill'd his good Friend; and thus he traces him. <q>Does any one desire to know the <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Sozom.</hi> l. 6. c. 1.</note> Man that kill'd him? I know not his Name; but that he was none of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, this is a clear proof, that no Body a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Persians</hi> was rewarded for that Blow. Although the King of <hi>Persia</hi> made proclamation of rewarding him that kill'd him, yet no Body was tempted by the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to brag that he did it. And we are beholden to our Enemies, that they would not assume the Glory of those things which they did not do, but have allowed us to seek for the Murderer amongst our selves. Now his Life was not for their profit, who did not live according to his Laws, and had long plotted against him, and having then an oppotunity, put it it in execution. And <hi>Libanius</hi> writing after this fashion, insinuates, that he who kill'd <hi>Julian</hi> was a Christian; which it may be (says the <note place="margin">Ib. cap. 2.</note>  Historian) was true. </q>This is a strange Concession, but you will more wonder that he should justify such a Traiterous Assassi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and yet he does in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing words. <q>For it is not improbable, that some one of the Souldiers might take into consideration, how the Heathens, and all Men to this day, do still praise those who long since have killed Tyrants, as Men that were willing to die for the Common Liberty, and defended in that manner their Country-men, Kinsmen, and Friends. And you can hardly blame him, <note place="margin">

               <p>And now we have brought <hi>Julian</hi> to his Grave, it may reasonably be expected, that there the Christians should let him rest in quiet, and let fall their Quarrel when their Enemy was gone. Which whether they did or no, shall be shewn in the next Chapter.</p>

reason, he very much bewails the Sin of all those that withered away, when there was no greater heat of Temptation. <q>If Men sell away from Christianity, they were ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculously overcome, (as St. <hi>Chrysostom</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Chrysost.</hi> Hom. 40. de SS. Juv. &amp; Max. mox ab i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nit.</note> expresses it); and if they persevered, it was no such great matter to quit a Trade  or Profession for their Religion.</q> Which was the Case of the discarded School-masters, and Physicians, and Souldiers, and was the greatest severity of all <hi>Julian's</hi> Edicts. He was, if we will speak properly, rather a Tempter than a Persecutor; <q>for some he <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Greg.</hi> O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat. 10 in <hi>Caesar.</hi> p. 167.</note> seduced with Mony, others with Places of Trust, others with Promises, others with Honours of all sorts, which he exposed in all Mens sight, not like a King, but in a very servile manner; and others again he won by the witchcraft of his words, and by  his own Example. </q>He wrought upon Men's Covetousness and Ambition, more than up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their Fear; and that with so good suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess, that St. <hi>Asterius</hi> says, <q>It verifies the <note place="margin">Homil. 3. cont.

Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trum Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon. <hi>p.</hi> 704.</note> saying of <hi>Paul,</hi> a Preacher of Truth, that  <hi>Covetousness is Idolatry.</hi> 
                  </q>And as for what he designed against the Christians, it was far short of what other Emperors had exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted. And yet how do the Christians treat this Emperor! One would take Them to be the Apostates; one while reproaching him, ruffling with him, and vexing every Vein in his Royal Heart; another while saying all their Prayers backwards, and calling down Vengeance upon his Head; after that, dancing and leaping for joy at his Death, and insulting over his Memory. But for the name of Christians, he had better have fallen amongst Barbarians. And yet he of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten put them in mind of their Christianity too: He told them, when they complained


<pb n="42" facs="tcp:47487:34"/>
of any Oppression; <q>It is your part, when <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Socrat.</hi> l. 3. c. 14.</note> you are ill used, to bear it, for this is the Commandment of your God. But they flurt at him for this, and say, He makes a very wise Speech, and this he remembers <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Greg.</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vect. 1. <hi>p.</hi> 94, 95.</note> since he was Reader; and he should have read on, and not skip'd over that Passage, The wicked Man shal be miserably destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, such a one as denies God, and which is more, vexes those that persevere in the Confession of him. They ask, How or where that Right is that they should suffer and bear it, and that the Heathens should not spare those, who when time was spared  them?</q> They call him by the bloodiest Names of the Devil, for taking advantage of the Christian Doctrine in this Particular, which says, <q>We must not avenge our selves, nor go to Law, &amp;c. nor render Evil for Evil, but pray for, and wish well to those  who injure and persecute us.</q> And in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion, they come with their Distinctions, and tell him, <q>That he must not think to drive all Men up to the top and pinacle of Vertue. For there are several commands in the Gospel, (which are no more than Counsels of Perfection) which bring ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and reward to them that keep them, but to those that do not keep them, no  manner of danger at all. </q>Is not this the right course to interpret and gloss away all their Duty? In a word, they seem to have broke all the Measures by which all the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient and Suffering Christians have gone in all former Persecutions.</p>
               <p>The plain truth of the Matter is this; Their Cafe differed very much, and they were in quite other Circumstances than the first Christians were. When <hi>Julian</hi> came to the Crown, he found them in full


<pb n="43" facs="tcp:47487:34"/>
and quiet possession of their Religion, which they had enjoy'd without interruption for almost fifty Years, and which was so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>estimable a Blessing, that they had plainly undervalued it, if they had not done their utmost to keep it. And then to have this Treasure wrested out of their hands, by one that had been bred up in the Bosom of the Church, who profess'd himself a Christian, and never pull'd off his Masque, till it was too late for them to help themselves; this was enough to raise, not only all their Zeal, but all their Indignation too. Whereas the poor Primitive Christians of all, were born to Persecution, they neither knew better, nor expected it. They professed their new Religion, as in some places the propounded new Laws, with an Haltar about their Necks. The Laws of the Empire were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways in force against them, though not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways put in execution; and the edge of the Ax stood always towards them, though it were not at all times stained with their Blood.</p>
               <p>In a word, they perpetually lay at the Mercy of their Enemies: their Religion at the best was in the VVorld but upon suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, as <hi>Abraham</hi> was in the Land of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan;</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Acts 7. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>where he had none Inheritance, no not so much as to set his foot on.</hi> But as his afflicted Posterity were afterwards Lords of that Country, so after another Egyptian Bondage, Christianity was advanced to be the established Religion of the Empire. It is worth the while to read <hi>Eusebius,</hi> only to see in what a transport of joy the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians were, upon that happy Revolution. The Christian World at that time, was the very Picture of Heaven. Such joy there will be again amongst good Men, when they


<pb n="44" facs="tcp:47487:35"/>
have cross'd the tempestuous Sea of this VVorld, and are safely landed in the Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Light and Immortality. For what <hi>Gregory</hi> says of <hi>Constantius,</hi> was true of <note place="margin">Invect. 1. <hi>p.</hi> 64.</note> many others; <q>Never any Man in this VVorld set his Heart so much upon any other thing, as he did to see the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans flourish, and to have all the advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of Glory and Power. And neither conquered Nations, nor a well-govern'd Empire, nor great Treasures, nor excess of Glory, nor being King of Kings, nor be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing stiled so, nor all other things, which make up other Men's Notion of happiness, did delight him so much, as to have the honour of bringing Honour to the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, and of leaving them establish'd for ever in the possession of Power and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority. </q> And Men that valued the esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishment of their Religion at this Rate, would not easily part with it. Now for <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian,</hi> who by his Baptism first, and by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> into Orders after, and by his going to Church after that, sufficiently engaged him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to maintain Christianity, to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour on the other hand to dispossess them of their Free-hold, was an insupportable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury.</p>
               <p>Is there no difference, I appeal to all the VVorld, between being turn'd out as Sheep among VVolves, which was the deplorable, but unavoidable case of the first Christians, and being worried by one of their own Flock? Has a Man no more Right nor Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledg after he is naturalized, than when he was a Stranger, or Alien, or accounted an Enemy? Do not the same Laws, which forbid Men to invade other Men's Rights, enable them notwithstanding to maintain and defend their own? These are the plain


<pb n="45" facs="tcp:47487:35"/>
and palpable differences between the State of the first Christians, and of those under <hi>Julian.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To sum up all in one word; The first Christians suffered according to the Laws of their Country, whereas these under <hi>Julian</hi> were persecuted contrary to Law. For it is manifest that <hi>Julian</hi> oppressed them in a very illegal way. He did not fairly enact Sanguinary Laws against them for their Religion, but he put them to Death upon Shams, and pretended Crimes of Treason and Sacriledg. He dressed up <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Theod.</hi> l. 3. c. 14.</note> an Accusation of Treason against <hi>Juventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> and <hi>Maximus;</hi> and though they died for their generous Zeal, and hearty Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment for Christianity, he gave out, and commanded it to be noised abroad, That they were punish'd for Treasonable words.</p>
               <p>The other sham of Sacriledg St. <hi>Chryso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Hom. de SS. Juvent &amp; Max. mox ab init.</note> acquaints us with in these words: <q>If any one, in former Times, when Godly Kings had the Government, had either broken their Altars, thrown down their Temples, taken away their Oblations, or done any such thing, he was presently hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried away to the Tribunal; and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the Innocent were executed, when  they were only accused.</q> The truth of which <hi>Julian</hi> himself confirms in his own Writings; where he says, <q>Let no Man <note place="margin">Frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian.</hi> p. 540.</note> distrust the Gods, when he hears how some have done despite to Images and Temples. For have not many slain good Men, such as <hi>Socrates,</hi> and <hi>Dion,</hi> and the great <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedotimus,</hi> which I am well assured were much more the Care of the Gods than their Images are? But they have afterward punish'd their Murderers; and this like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise has manifestly happened in our Time,


<pb n="46" facs="tcp:47487:36"/>
 to those that were Robbers of Temples.</q> And besides all this, by his connivance and encouragement, he let loose the rage and fury of the Heathens upon them, as I shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before. And therefore <hi>Gregory,</hi> all over his <hi>Invectives,</hi> charges him with Tyranny, and often calls him Tyrant. So that the same Men, who would quietly have submit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Laws, under a <hi>Nero</hi> or a <hi>Dioclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi> do nevertheless pursue <hi>Julian,</hi> as if he were a Mid-night Thief, or a High-way Robber.</p>
               <p>As for us, who, blessed be God, <note place="margin">

For surely it is not of the Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of the Gospel, to be a Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering Religion, that is an evil Circumstance, which attends it only in bad Times; it is a Reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Religion amongst us, and I hope will never be otherwise while the World stands. And therefore I much won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der at those Men, who trouble the Nation at this time of the day, with the unseasonable prescriptions of Prayers and Tears, and the Passive Obedience of the <hi>Thobaean</hi> Legion, and such-like last Remedies, which are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, only at such a Time as the Laws of our Country are armed against our Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. What have we to do with the <hi>Thebaean</hi> Legion? Blessed be God, who has made the difference! but I ask again, VVhat have we to do with their Example? Are we to Sacrifice, or go to Mass to Morrow, or else


<pb n="47" facs="tcp:47487:36"/>
to have our Throats cut? Are we under the Sentence of Death, according to the Laws of our Country, if we do not present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly renounce our Religion? Poor Men, they were! and though they died as glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Martyrs, in respect of their Religion, yet they died as Criminals, and Malefactors, in the Eye of the Law. I hope many good Protestants would make a shift to die for their Religion, though it may be not with the gallantry that these Souldiers did, if they were in the like sad Circumstances, and had the Laws against them; but till then, they throw away their Lives, and are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly weary of them, if they practise any such Passive Obedience. And the truth is, we justly deserve to be so used, as the <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baean</hi> Legion was, and moreover to be loa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with the Curses of all Posterity, if we suffer our selves to be brought into that condition. For that can never happen, but by our own Treachery to our Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in parting with those good Laws which protect it, and in agreeing to such as shall destroy it.</p>
               <p>VVhen a Man is condemned by God and his Country, in a due course of Law, it is time for him to die, and he ought willingly to submit to the Laws of the Land, (for every Man enjoys the benefit and protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of them upon those terms; and <hi>Job</hi> lays down a great Rule of Equity, when he asks, Shall we receive Good things at the Hand of God, and not likewise Evil?) But if a Man be illegally assaulted, in the way of Violence and Assassination, he may use all lawful Remedies to defend himself.</p>

It is a currant Notion among the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, that we ought to spare our Persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, and not suffer them to be guilty of Murder. <hi>Gregory</hi> gives that as a very good <note place="margin">Invect. 1. <hi>Chrysost.</hi> Hom. <gap reason="foreign">

And so far it is fit to inform the Popish Crew (for we have no apprehensions of Persecution from any other Quarter) lest they should be mistaken in the good Protestant Religion of our good Church, as <hi>Coleman</hi> calls it in his Declaration. No doubt they would bestow more good words upon us, if we would be all Passive Protestants; for then the fewer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive Papists would serve to dispatch us. But most men are satisfied, that Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop <hi>Abbot's</hi> Doctrine was much more the good Protestant Religion of our good Church, than Dr. <hi>Sibthorp's;</hi> and that Dr. <hi>Manwaring</hi> was Orthodox when he Recan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, but by no means when he preached his <hi>Pulpit Law.</hi> For that name the Great and Loyal Lord <hi>Faulkland,</hi> long before the War broke out, was pleased to bestow up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on such mischievous flattery; which he then complained had almost ruined the Nation, and it can never be good for any thing else in any Age. And yet the Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Doctrine of those Times did not bring any great terror along with it, it was then but a Rake, and served only to scrape up a little paltry Passive Money from the Subject, but now it is become a Murdering piece, loaden with no body knows how many Bullets. And that the Patrons of it may not complain that it is an <hi>exploded Doctrine,</hi> as if Men only hooted at it, but could not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer it, I shall stay to speak a little more to it.</p>
               <p>'Tis true, this Doctrine cannot discover its malignity under his Majesty's Gracious Reign, which God prolong and prosper, who has been pleased to give the Nation the security of his Coronation Oath, which we know all Protestant Princes value and


<pb n="50" facs="tcp:47487:38"/>
look upon as Sacred, and likewise of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Gracious, Promises, that He will go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern according to Law. But in case we should be so sharply punished for our Sins, as to fall under a Popish Successor, then this Bloody Doctrine will have the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to shew it self in its own Colours, and we may then see, and it may be, feel the sting of it.</p>
               <p>For, <hi>first,</hi> I suppose these Men will allow a Popish Successor, when he is in possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to be a <hi>Lawful Magistrate;</hi> because, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to them, it is not lawful, no not for the King and Parliament, to exclude him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I suppose that this Lawful Magistrate will <hi>persecute</hi> Protestants; for by so doing, he does God and the Church good Service, he merits Heaven; he cannot better testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the truth and reality of his Conversion: Nay, if he does not persecute Hereticks with Fire and Sword, he lies at the Pope's Mercy to have his Kingdom taken from him; and further, he is in danger to be so ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, as the two <hi>Henries</hi> of <hi>France</hi> were. However, because some Persons are so happy as to believe that he will not <hi>persecute!</hi> no; he will protect the Church of <hi>England</hi> as it is now established by Law, and be a Mighty Defender of the Faith; I shall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with what every Body must grant, that he <hi>may persecute,</hi> that the thing is pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible.</p>
               <p n="3">3. In this case all Protestants cannot <hi>fly,</hi> they will not be all in travelling case; and if they were, the Ports may be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

and expose it to a Conquest; they may likewise believe it a thing of very ill Consequence, <hi>perdere Patriam,</hi> which no Man in <hi>England</hi> is bound to do.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Now we are taught in this Case, That if Men do not over-run their Country, there is nothing but <hi>Death</hi> or <hi>Damnation</hi> at home; or, as it is in their own words. <q>Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <note place="margin">p. <hi>8.</hi>
                     </note> doth the Gospel prescribe any Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy but flight, against the Persecutions of the lawful Magistrate, allowing of no other mean, when we cannot escape be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt  denying, and dying for the Faith. </q>What the Gospel prescribes is one thing, what it allows is another; there are ten thousand things allowed by the Gospel, not one of which is prescribed by it, indite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, Appeals, suing for Tythes; in a word, all humane Constitutions, which are not morally Evil. But it seems the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel does not so much as allow any mean, when we cannot escape by flight, betwixt denying and dying for the Faith. As for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying the Faith, that is down-right Destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, both of Body and Soul, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is not to be thought of, as being the far greater extremity of the two. And so welcome Death! But by what Law must we die? Not by any Law of God surely, for being of that Religion which he approves, and would have all the World to embrace, and to hold fast to the end. Nor by the Laws of our Country, where Protestancy is so far from being Criminal that it is Death to desert it and to turn Papist. By what Law then? By none that I know of, but Parasites, Sycophants, &amp; Murderers may. For it is plain, that every Protestant, who is persecuted to death in these Circumstances,


<pb n="52" facs="tcp:47487:39"/>
is barbarously murdered. If they can tell us therefore, who it is, in that Case, that shall have authority to commit open, bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faced, and down right murders, they will then direct us where to pay our Passive O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience. It would be the horridest slander in the World, to say, that any such Power is lodged in the Prerogative as to destroy men contrary to Law. The Prerogative is no such boundles bottomless Pit of Arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry power and self will, but it is limited, stated, and certain, and as well known as other parts of the Law; and it is fit it should be so, that the Subject may not offend a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst it. It is the Glory of the Crown, and is intended to be for the Benefit, Quiet, and Safety of the people, to save innocent Lives, and not to destroy them. There is no authority upon Earth above the Law, much less against it; and that this Doctor might have seen, if he had pleased to have read on in that very Chapter of <hi>Bracton,</hi>

For it is an undeniable Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>im, <hi>Where there is no Law, there is no Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression.</hi> I freely and readily acknowledge, that according to the known Laws of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> this Popish Prince, when he is lawfully possest of the Crown, will be inviolable and unaccountable, as to his own person, and ought by no means to have any violence of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to him; for <hi>who can do that</hi> as <hi>David</hi> says of an anointed King, <hi>and be guiltless?</hi> so that if a Man be reduced to those Straits, as either

to lose his Life, or contract Guilt by keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, he ought to die, and his time is come. But this must needs be a rare case, which can seldom happen; for bad Princes are hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ever known to stoop so low, as to be the Executioners of their own Cruelty, they generally reserve themselves for a better Office. And how far men may endeavour notwithstanding to save themselves, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out breach of their Allegiance, and of that true Faith and Loyalty which they ought to bear of Life, and Limb, and terrene Honour, if they have a mind to know, they may ask advice.</p>
               <p>But though we are out of our pain, as to this first difficulty, yet still there is nothing but despair left behind; for <hi>him that esca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth the Sword of</hi> Hazael, <hi>shall</hi> Jehu <hi>slay, and him that escapeth from the Sword of</hi> Jehu, <hi>shall</hi>

that no Inferiour Magistrate is to be resisted in the exercise of his Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, so far as he is warranted by Law; but illegal force may be repelled by Force, if you will believe <hi>Bracton,</hi> who has these words; <hi>Ei qui vult viribus uti, erit virili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>

               <p>All the world knows, that it is a misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune for a man, in his own lawful Defence, to kill another, but it is neither Murder nor Felony; whereas it is Murder even in a Magistrate to kill any man, if it be not done in due course of Law. And through the help of God, though we cannot hinder the Papists from being Idolaters, we will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to keep them from being Murde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, they shall not have that to answer for too.</p>
               <p>Is the Doctor serious, and in earnest, when he teaches and preaches up Passive Obedience for Evangelical in this Case? Would he really have men prostitute their Lives to Malice and Violence, when all the Laws of God, and of the Kingdom, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect them? Surely this is too light for the Pulpit, and is just such another piece of Drollery, as that which was dedicated to <hi>Oliver Cromwell,</hi> in the Book called, <hi>Kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling no Murder.</hi> Where the Ingenuous Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor

For as a worthy person has lately observed, <hi>One sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle Arm, unresisted, may go a great way in Mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sacring a Nation.</hi> But how many irresista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Arms will there be lifted up against us under a Popish Successor, when every petty Popish Officer, according to this Doctrine, shall be an Absolute Emperour, and have the Power of Life and Death? It is a Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine fit to turn a Nation into a Shambles, and enough to tempt and invite Tyranny and Cruelty into the World. For let a Prince be either a Papist, or an Atheist, and his Subjects well fetter'd and mannacled with this slavish Principle; and then what hinders, but the one of them may destroy Millions for their Estates and Heresie toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and the other as many, to see what ugly faces and grimaces they will make. The lives of the best men in the World shall be exposed to the fiery and ambitious Zeal of a Papist, or the extravagant and

unaccountable humours of a Wretch; and hang at their Girdle, as Souls do at the Pope's.</p>
               <p>If the Doctor looks upon these as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted Cases, why did he not except them; why did he not particularly except the Case of a Popish Successor, the mischi of which, it has been the care of several Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments to prevent, and of which we have such a dismal prospect, that it makes every honest mans heart to ake. But I am afraid this Doctrine is calculated and fitted on purpose for the use of a Popish Successor, and to make us an easier prey to the Bloody Papists. For why else is there all that Wrath against every little Pamphlet which op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses that Interest?</p>
               <p>How comes the <hi>History of the Succession</hi> to <note place="margin">P. 29.</note> be an Impious and Treasonable Book, and the <hi>Dialogue between Tutor and Pupil</hi> ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? Why, the first is an Impious and Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable Book, because it shews how the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession has been alterable in all ages. And this is so far from being an Impious or Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable Assertion, that it was impious High Treason, in Queen <hi>Elizabeth's</hi> Time, to say the contrary; and is still Impiety, and forfeiture of Goods and Chattels at this day. Which is so far from making the Monarchy Elective, as the Doctor might easily have understood, if he had read the Ancient Historians of <hi>England,</hi> instead of <hi>Dissenters Sayings.</hi> He would likewise have found it possible to write an History of the Succession, without borrowing from <hi>Dole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> and impossible to write it, without having a great many passages, which <hi>Dole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> has got into his Book.</p>
               <p>

                  <pb n="58" facs="tcp:47487:42"/>
And the other is an Impious and Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable <note place="margin">For that is the true meaning of sitting, till all Grievan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are redres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, and Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered.</note> Book, for saying, <hi>That Parliaments should sit till they have done that for which they are called, and sit, and were originally intended.</hi> But these men are not for a Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish Successor, and so they and their Books, and whatever they have said, is to be blast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the names of Impious and Treaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable. He talks as if he were already ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived at that Age, in which these Books will be sure to be called Treason, and the Authors used accordingly, unless they make haste and die out of the way, as my Lord <hi>Hollis</hi> has done, who is another of his Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious and Treasonable Authors.</p>
               <p>However, let the Design of preaching up Passive Obedience, and the Example of the <hi>Thebaean</hi> Legion, at this time especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, be what it will; if the Papists taking us to be all Passive, and a fine glib and easie morsel, shall try to swallow up innocent men quick, it is my hearty desire that they may find themselves choak'd. For where is it said, in the Word of the Lord, which these men cannot go beyond, that the World was made only for <hi>Banditi,</hi> or that we are to yield up our selves to Cut-throats and Assassinates, which the Papists have ever been to poor Protestants; and how many hundred thousands they have massa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred I know not; but this I know, that they never did, nor ever will massacre more or less than just as many as they can.</p>

                  <hi>2dly,</hi> The passage has nothing at all of that sense which they put upon it, speaking of the grievous things <hi>Julian</hi> designed against the Christians; but says <hi>Gregory,</hi> he was hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred by the Goodness of God, and the Tears of Christians, which were shed in great plenty by many, who had this only Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy against the Persecutor.

For besides, that <hi>Julian</hi> had gotten all the strength of the Empire into his Hands, there seems to have been a general Revolt from Christianity, almost like that in Queen <hi>Mary's</hi> time; which makes St. <hi>Asterius</hi> say, <hi>Quantus ab Ecclesiâ ad al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taria</hi>

               <p>The Protestants in Queen <hi>Mary's</hi> Days, found their short disjunctive prayer made High Treason, <hi>ex post Facto,</hi> though they prayed, in the first place, <hi>That God would turn her Heart from Idolatry: and in case that were not done, then to take her out of the way.</hi> Whereas I do notfind that there is one single wish among the Ancients for <hi>Julian's</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version, but all for his down right destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>

               <p>WHenever Paganism is named, the most obvious thing in it, and that which comes first to our Thoughts, is the multitude of Gods which they worshipped. And that the Papists have herein equalled and out-done the old Pagans,</p>
               <p>I shall first shew, is the publick and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And, secondly, I shall demonstrate the truth of it.</p>
               <p>First, That the Papists are gross <hi>Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theists,</hi> and worship a vast number of false Gods, is the publick and professed Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Church of <hi>England:</hi> And he that doubts of this, never read the <hi>Homilies;</hi> which I shall take this occasion to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend to every Bodies reading, as one of the best Books that I know in the World next the Bible, and in the mean time shall set down several passages at large, which plainly shew what is the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Church in this point. In the third part of the Sermon against <hi>Peril of Idolatry,</hi> you have these words:</p>
               <p>And for that Idolatry standeth <note place="margin">Hom. Tom. <hi>2.</hi> p. <hi>46.</hi>
                  </note> chiefly in the mind, it shall in this part first be proved, that our Image<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maintainers have had, and have the


<pb n="68" facs="tcp:47487:47"/>
same Opinions and Judgements of Saints, whose Images they have made and worshipped, as the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles Idolaters had of their Gods. And afterwards shall be declared, That our Image-maintainers and worshippers, have used, and use the same outward Kites of honouring and worshipping their Images, as the Gentiles did use before their I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dols, and that therefore they commit Idolatry, as well inwardly and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly, as did the wicked Gentiles Idolaters.</p>
               <p>And concerning the first part of the Idolatrous Opinions of our I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage-maintainers. What I pray you he such Saints with us, to whom we attribute the defence of certain Countries, spoiling God of his due Donour herein, but Dii tutelares of the Gentiles Idolaters? Such as were Belus to the Babylonians and Assyrians, Osiris and Isis to the Egy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptians, Vulcane to the Lemnians, and to such other.</p>
               <p>What be such Saints to whom the safeguard of certain Cities are appointed, but Dii Praesides with the Gentiles Idolaters? Such as were at Delphos, Apollo; at Athens, Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerva; at Carthage, Juno; at Rome, Quirinus, &amp;c. What be such Saints, to whom, contrary to the use of the Primitive Church, Temples and


<pb n="69" facs="tcp:47487:47"/>
Churches be builded, and Altars erected, but Dii Patroni, of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles Idolaters? Such as were in the Capitol Jupiter, in Paphus Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Venus, in Ephesus Temple Diana, and such like. Alas, we seem in thus thinking and doing, to have learned our Religion, not out of God's Word, but out of the Pagan Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets, who say, Excessere omnes adytis, arisque relictis, Dii quibus imperium hoc steterat, &amp;c. That is to say, All the Gods, by whose defence this Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire stood, are gone out of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and have forsaken their Altars. And where one Saint hath Images in divers places, the same Saint hath divers names thereof, most like to the Gentiles. When you hear of our Lady of Walsingham, our La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Ipswich, our Lady of Wilsdon, and such other: What is it but an imitation of the Gentiles Idolaters? Diana Agrotera, Diana Coriphea, Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na Ephesia, &amp;c. Venus Cypria, Venus Paphia, Venus Gnidia. Whereby is evidently meant, that the Saint for the Image sake, should in those places, yea, in the Images them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, have a dwelling, which is the ground of their Idolatry. For where no Images be, they have no such means. Terentius Varro sheweth, that there were three hundred Jupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in his Time, there were no


<pb n="70" facs="tcp:47487:48"/>
fewer Veneres and Dianae, we had no fewer Christophers, Ladies, Mary Magdalenes, and other Saints. Oeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maus and Hesiodus shew, that in their time there were thirty thousand Gods. I think we had no fewer Saints, to whom we gave the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour due to God. And they have not only spoiled the true living God of his due Honour, in Temples, Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, Countries, and Lands, by such Devices and Inventions as the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles Idolaters have done before them: But the Sea and Waters have as well special Saints with them, as they had Gods with the Gentiles, Neptune, Triton, Nereus, Castor and Pollux, Venus, and such other. In whole places be come Saint Christo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher, Saint Clement, and divers other, and specially our Lady, to whom Shipmen sing Ave Maris stella. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath the Fire scaped the idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous inventions. For instead of Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can and Vesta, the Gentiles Gods of the Fire, our men have placed Saint Agatha, and make Letters on her day for to quench Fire with. Every Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificer and Profession hath his special Saint, as a peculiar God. As for Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, Scholars have Saint Nicholas and Saint Gregory; Printers, Saint Luke; neither lack Souldiers their Mars, nor Lovers their Venus, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst Christians.</p>

                  </gap> lack their Gods with us, for Saint Loy is the Dorse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leech, and Saint Anthony the Swine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd, &amp;c. Where is God's Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and due Honour in the mean season? who saith, The Heavens be mine, and the Earth is mine, &amp;c. But we have left him neither Heaven, nor Earth, nor Water, nor Countrey, nor City, Peace nor War, to rule and govern, neither Men, nor Beasts, nor their Diseases to Cure, that a Godly man might justly for zealous indignation cry out, O Heaven, O Earth, and Seas, what madness and wickedness against God are men fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len into? What dishonour do the Creatures to their Creator and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker? And if we remember God some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time, yet because we doubt of his Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity or Will to help, we joyn to him another Helper, as if he were a Noun Adjective, using these sayings; Such as Learn, God and Saint Nicholas be my speed; such as Neese, God help and Saint John: To the Horse, God and Saint Loy save thee. Thus are we become like Horses and Bules, which have no understanding. For, is there not one God only, who by his Power


<pb n="72" facs="tcp:47487:49"/>
and Wisdom made all things, and by his Providence governeth the same? and by his goodness maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and faveth them? Be not all Things of him, by him, and through him? Why dost thou turn from the Creatur to the Creatures? This is the manner of the Gentiles Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; but thou art a Christian, and therefore by Christ alone hast access to God the Father, and help of him only. These things are not wzit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to any reproach of the Saints themselves, who were the true Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of God, and did give all ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to him, taking none unto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and are blessed Souls with God: but against our foolishness and wickedness, making of the true Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of God, false Gods, by attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buting to them the Power and Donour which is God's, and due to him only.</p>
               <p>And after more to the same purpose, there are these words.</p>
               <p>If answer be made, That they <note place="margin">Pag. 48.</note> make Saints but obtain to God, and means for such things as they would obtain of God: that is, even after the Gentiles idolatrous usage, to make them of Saints, Gods, called Dii Medioximi, to be mean Intercessozs and Helpers to God, &amp;c.</p>

There cannot be a fuller charge of <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lytheism</hi> than this is, which is here drawn up against the Papists, for making Gods of the Saints, nay, for making as very Devils of them, as ever any of the Heathen Gods were.

That the very Act of directing their prayers to Saints, implies this Ubiquity, is very plain; for they im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately apply themselves to the Saints, that they may obtain their mediation to God. So that their prayers are not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to be conveyed by God to the Saints, but to come directly to them, and by them to be recommended to God.

Now not only the Scripture attributes this as proper and peculiar to God; so <hi>Solomon</hi> says, <hi>Thou only know st the Hearts of the Children of men:</hi> And God appropriates it to himself, <hi>The Heart is</hi>

                  <note place="margin">Jer. 17. 9, 10.</note> 
                  <hi>who can know it? I the Lord search the Heart, I try the Reins.</hi> But likewise the Heathens themselves attributed it to their Gods, as that which was the ground of worshipping them, and of attesting them in all their Oaths and solemn Compacts Not only to know what is in man, but to know what is in all men, and at all times, is the perfection of infinite knowledge: which it is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore impossible for Saints or Angels to have, because it is a contradiction, for a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to have so much as one single infinite perfection.</p>
               <p>It would be a great presumption in us, to go about to fix the Bounds and Limits of their enlarged understandings, and to tell just how wise an Angel of God is. They may for ought I know have an intui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive knowledge, without the trouble and hazzard of reasoning, and see the remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test Conclusions by as clear a light, as we do first principles: They may, in many other respects, have their under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standings elevated and enlightned, beyond what we can imagine. Yet it is no pre. sumption to say, that they have not any such knowledge in any kind, as may equal them with God: But on the other hand, it is Blasphemy to ascribe that to them, than which we cannot ascribe any thing greater to him. And this knowledge of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing and searching men's Hearts, the Papists not only imply in their praying to Saints and Angels, and decree in their Councils, but they openly avow it like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise in their writings, and will prove it by Scripture it self. Cardinal <hi>Perrone</hi> for one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst many others, proves that the Saints


<pb n="78" facs="tcp:47487:52"/>
know men's Hearts, because they are equal to the Angels: and the Angels assuredly know them, because they rejoyce at the Conversion of a Sinner; which is the inward change of man's mind, and lies very deep, even at the bottom of the Heart. But far less charity than the Angels burn withal, and a much smaller degree of knowledge than they really are endued with, will solve this <hi>Phaenomenon.</hi> For cannot such silly Wretches as we, be glad of the conversion of a sinner, who was given for lost, though we never saw him in our lives; if we be assured of it by a very good Friend, who likewise was himself the happy Author of this Conversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and invites us to congratulate the good success of his care and pains in it? And that this is the very case of the Angels Joy, I will venture to refer it to any man that will but once read over the first ten verses of the <hi>15th</hi> Chapter of St. <hi>Luke.</hi> They like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise argue from <hi>Elisha's</hi> Heart going with <hi>Gehazi,</hi> and from his discovering the King of <hi>Syria's</hi> Counsels. But, 1. these were Actions and Words, which are nothing near so private as thoughts. And then, 2. there is no consequence from the extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary performances of Saints and Prophets enabled and inspired by God, to infer an ordinary and constant power and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of doing such things, at all times. Have the Saints and Angels <hi>Praescience,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause Prophets have been some times ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to foretel Things to come?

               <p>And this Title is so familiarly given to the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> that it seems to be annex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to her Imperial Stile; for I will be bound, at very short warning, to produce an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred places out of their publick and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Devotions, where she is called by that Name. We are extreamly beholden to the Papists, and ought to take this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to thank them, for answering an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection of <hi>Mahomet</hi> against our Saviour's Divinity. For he being a crafty Impostor, found a necessity of lessening our Saviour, and making him barely a Prophet: by which means he himself would clearly have the advantage, in being the last Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet. And therefore he not only tells a ridiculous Story, how Jesus the Son of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> being questioned for it by God, utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly denyed that ever he called himself the Son of God, and laid all the fault upon his Followers, because they had done it of their own Heads; but likewise he repeats and inculcates it all over his <hi>Alcoran,</hi> that there is but one God only, and no more. And in one place, I remember he gives this reason for it: There is but one God and no more, and he has no Son, for he


<pb n="88" facs="tcp:47487:57"/>
never had a Wife. But now there's an end of that Turkish Argument. And now likewise the Secret is out. For I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess it has often amazed me, to see the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant Blasphemies, which are used in their prayers to the Virgin <hi>Mary:</hi> as when they call her <hi>the Fountain of Mercy,</hi> (which <note place="margin">

                  </note> is the brightest and loveliest apprehension of God, that can possess the minds of Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures); when they call her, <hi>Empress of Heaven, who upheld the Cherubim and Sera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phim from falling,</hi> (there I thought them mad) <hi>whom all the Angels worship,</hi> (that methought was but reasonable, supposing the former) <hi>whom the Sun, Moon, and Stars, and the whole Creation, are called upon to praise and magnify,</hi> (as if she had been the Maker of them all) <hi>and who threw</hi> Pharaoh <hi>and his Host into the Red Sea,</hi> (there, thought I, they make old Time go back a thousand years for this piece of Flattery). Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as this unthought of Relation entitles her to every thing that is, was or can be in the Universal World. Methinks such rank Blasphemy as this should poyson the Air, into which it is breathed forth, and blast the whole Creation round about! I am sure it will make the Ears of all Christians to tingle, and raise their Blood against such an horrid Religion.</p>
               <p>And thus I have proved the <hi>Papists,</hi> out of their own blasphemous mouths, to be <hi>Polytheists,</hi> in setting up Saints and Angels for Gods, and in giving Divine Honour to them. I have employed no other Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, at present, to prove this, than only their prayers to them; whereas I might have used very many others, as he that will read the <hi>Homily</hi> against Peril of Idolatry,

may easily see. Against certain truth, I know there cannot possibly be any materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Objection: but I would answer all tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling ones, if I could foresee them. It may be the <hi>Papists</hi> will say, They do not make the Angels and Saints Gods, because they make them, in many respects, inferior to God. Were the Heathen Gods no Gods, because <hi>Jupiter</hi> was King of them? Was <hi>Vulcan</hi> no God, because he was only armed with an Hammer, and not with the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign Thunderbolt? What difference the heathens made betwixt <hi>Jupiter</hi> and the other Gods, you may in part see, by this following passage, taken out of <hi>Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min's</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Eusebii Eccl. Hist. l. <hi>8.</hi> c. <hi>6.</hi>

These poor helpless Gods, were so far from being Omnipotent, that they needed the protection of <hi>Jupiter,</hi> as much as the meanest of their Votaries.</p>
               <p>Or it may be they will say, They reserve peculiar Worship and Services to God, which they do not communicate to Saints: For they tell us, <q>They celebrate the Mass <note place="margin">Rem. Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chis. p. <hi>204.</hi>
                     </note> indeed, in memory and honour of the Saints; but the Priest never uses to say, I offer Sacrifice to thee <hi>Peter,</hi> or <hi>Paul;</hi>  namely this Sacrifice of the Mass.</q> For that they offer all other Sacrifices, if it please God to give me Life and Health, I shall hereafter fully prove: and then they shall hear more of this deceitful Juggle too, and of the Tricks they have played with St. <hi>Austin's</hi> words.</p>
               <p>

                  <pb n="90" facs="tcp:47487:58"/>
We grant they do not offer the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of the Mass to the Saints, but to the Trinity: So that they offer the Son of God to himself; and according to the usual <hi>decorum,</hi> which they constantly observe in that awkerd Religion, which is made to spite the Reason of Mankind; As our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our once heretofore sat at the Table dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coursing and lay sowering in twelve seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral mens Stomachs at the same time, so now he is every day, in person, both the Sacrifice it self upon Earth, and the God in Heaven to whom it is offered. None, but such a Fool as I am, would stand argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and disputing with these men; whom all the Reason upon Earth can never di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stress, by reducing them to Impossibilities or Absurdities, when they own and profess these Absurdities and Contradictions of their own accord: it would certainly be more wisdom, to go and preach, as Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable <hi>Beds</hi> once did, to a heap of stones. But to proceed nevertheless, are not we to take it for a great favour, that they do not offer the Great God of Heaven in Sacrifice to <hi>Thomas</hi> of <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>?</hi> The Gentiles Idolaters were so far from offering <hi>Jupiter</hi> in Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to any petty God, that I never yet read, that they offered him in Sacrifice to himself. There is no consequence at all in this reasoning; The Papists do not offer the Sacrifice of the Mass to Saints and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, but only to the Trinity, therefore they do not make Saints and Angels Gods. For had not the Heathens proper Sacrifices for <hi>Jupiter,</hi> which were sacred only to him? and yet this did not destroy the Divinity of the other Deiries. It makes no more difference amongst the Gods, nor affects


<pb n="91" facs="tcp:47487:58"/>
their God-head any more, to have this or that particular Sacrifice, offered or not of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to them, than it did for <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               <p>
                  <hi>Lastly,</hi> The Papists may possibly say, That there is great difference betwixt the Gods of the Pagans, and the Saints which they honour and worship: the former ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been lewd men, and sometimes feigned persons; the latter being such as we Hereticks pay some respect to, though not enough. I shall not now enter into the merits of that Cause, but refer them to a great Prelate of our Church, who has told them, That they Worship Saints in Heaven, and Saints in Hell, and Saints that are in neither place, nor ever were in being. Though, by the way, I cannot find any such great difference betwixt <hi>Romulus</hi> and <hi>Igna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius Loyola;</hi> the one having been, in his time, the Governour of a Den of Thieves, and the other the Captain General of the Modern <hi>Banditi:</hi> and it is all one to me, whether they worship the Nine Muses, or <note place="margin">Vid.

                  </gap> and suppress any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of


<pb n="104" facs="tcp:47487:65"/>
Scripture, which makes against them: and that they have shamefully done in this place. They afterwards allow the <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites</hi> to be Idolaters, for <hi>changing their Glory into the similitude of a Caif that eateth Hay;</hi> and the Heathens in this place, for <hi>changing the Glory of God into the</hi>

                  <hi>similitude of Birds and Beasts, and creeping Things.</hi> Now it is true, they do not trade in this sort of Imagery, and therefore they are willing that it should pass for Idolatry. But St. <hi>Paul's</hi> first instance of Idolatry, in this very passage, which they have shamefully mangled, is <hi>changing the Glory of the Incorruptible God, into the likeness of an Image of Corruptible Man:</hi> The absurdity whereof St. <hi>Paul</hi> expresses by an elegant Antithesis. But this falls heavy upon their own bald-pate Images, and their Monster Head with three Faces, and the other with an Imperial Crown on his Head, giving his Benisons with his two fore-fingers and Thumb, and that which sits with a Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifix resting on his Knees, and a Dove up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it; and to name no more, that same, which the honest <hi>Iconoclast</hi> found busie in creating the World, in a blue Coat, bare-foot and bare-legged, and marking out the Sun and Moon with a pair of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passes; and therefore they make no words at all of that part of the Text, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns these horrid Disguises of the Deity. What, dare they not quote an entire Text of Scripture to their own Priests, for this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

                  <pb n="105" facs="tcp:47487:65"/>
Nay, then I do not wonder at it any longer, that there was once a Vulgar Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, spoken above four hundred Years in a Catholick Country, which never was worthy to have the Second Commandment in it. That great Antiquary, Mr. <hi>Lamhert</hi> in his Notes upon the Preface to King <hi>Alu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red's</hi> Laws, has long since told the World, that he never met with that Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in any Copy that is written in the <hi>Saxon</hi> Language. By these practices we may see, that the Papists know themselves to be Idolaters, as well as we can tell them. But because they wipe their Mouths, and deny it, and endeavour to shuffle it off by nice Distinctions, I shall not think much to examine them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> They say, <q>They do not break <note place="margin">Rom. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> They say, <q>That these are not Pictures of the Divinity; but only that some Properties or Actions, attributed to  God, are declared by them.</q>
               </p>
               <p>In answer to the first of these Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuses.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> Let them then fairly confess them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves Idolaters, for making those Pictures of God, of which they have neither sign, nor shadow of a sign in Scripture. For under


<pb n="106" facs="tcp:47487:66"/>
which Testament did their Monster-head with three Faces appear? than which, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver did any Egyptian or Indian God make a worse Figure. Or out of which Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment did they copy their other pictures of the Trinity, that with a Crucifix on his Knees, or that where they sit all three a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breast; where our Saviour has holes in his Hands and Feet, that you may know him from the Holy Ghost, for otherwise they are like as the two <hi>Sosia's</hi> in <hi>Plautus!</hi> Had they these out of <hi>Daniel?</hi> And one or other of these abominable Images of the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, we had formerly in every Church, <note place="margin">3d part Peril Idol. <hi>p. 40.</hi>
                  </note> as the Compilers of the <hi>Homilies</hi> tell us; who, though they be not allowed as Doctors, may nevertheless serve for Testifiers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>2dly,</hi> If a Scripture Sign be the only au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentick Original of a Christian Image or Picture, then are theirs all Idols: for I never saw any of those, which they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to copy from <hi>Daniel's</hi> Dream, but va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried extreamly from the Original. They add very much in some things, and in others they take away. They picture the Ancient of Days like an Old Man; there is <note place="margin">Dan. 7. 9.</note> no such word as <hi>Man</hi> in <hi>Daniel:</hi> Then they give him all the Lineaments of a Face, and a Beard, purely out of their own Inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: And then, as for the Drapery, the Painter himself is the fashioner, for there is nothing more of it mentioned in <hi>Daniel,</hi> than the Colonr of the Garment. In a word, the Lines and proportion of the Body, the Face and Features, are altogether as the Painter pleases. If men had not been


<pb n="107" facs="tcp:47487:66"/>
stark mad of Idolatry, they would never have catch'd thus at the shadow of a Dream, and gone to work furnish'd with no better Instructions, than with the description of Eternity, of the colour of a Head of Heir, the colour of a Garment, and the posture of sitting.</p>
               <p>The Jews might as well have taken hints from <hi>Moses's</hi> Metaphorical Expressions of the Hand, and Arm, and Finger of God, and much more from his own speaking to them, to have pictured God in a humane Shape; from which they are so often and so strictly forewarned.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>3dly,</hi> These Sign-Painters shew the worst Judgment that can be, in chusing their Pattern out of <hi>Daniel.</hi> For every Body knows, that Prophetick Dreams and Visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and the Schemes of their Language, and their Descriptions, are more wide from the thing it self, and more unlike, than the


<pb n="108" facs="tcp:47487:67"/>
harshest Metaphors that ever were in the World. Flourishing Kingdoms are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented in that Book by Rams Horns, and Goats Horns: which would make very unintelligible Pictures of Kingdoms, and would certainly require a Label to tell what they are. And therefore for men to fetch the Picture of God out of such a Book, where besides, above two thirds of their Picture is a perfect blank, is to do just like Children, but not with their Innocency, who, rather than fail of a Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to play withal, will make it of a Clout.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Their other Excuse is, <q>That <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Rom. Catech.</hi> p. 300.</note> these are not pictures of the Divinity; but only that some properties, or acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, attributed to God, are declared by  them.</q>
               </p>
               <p>To this I Answer;</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>1st,</hi> That not only their common peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, but all Papists call these the Images of God the Father; of which we have an instance in the Margin of this Catechism, (which is as great an Authority as I cite it for) where it is called <hi>Dei Patris Imago.</hi> And if no body is so rude and ignorant, as to think the Divinity is expressed by <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> those Images, (as the Catechism says) Why then is every Body so rude and ignorant, as to call them by that Name? For an Image of God the Father, must be an Image of the Divinity, or an Image of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing: for I hope he never assumed Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity.</p>
               <p>

                  <pb n="109" facs="tcp:47487:67"/>
                  <hi>2dly,</hi> Further, it is undeniably plain, that the person of God the Father is declared by these Images, and not any properties or Actions. For would not he blazon a Picture of the Trinity very improperly, and like an Heretick, who should say, There is the Holy Ghost, and that is God the Son, and the other is Eternity, or infinite Wisdom? So that if a Picture of our Saviour stands for his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and the Dove, &amp;c. for the Holy Ghost, so does this Old Man for the person of God the Father.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>3dly,</hi> To let the <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </hi> have their own way, I afform, That the very declaring of the properties and Actions of the Deity by Images, was the Idolatry of the Heathens. For when they made an Image of <hi>Jupiter,</hi> they did not pretend that it was the very Figure of his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity, but declared some of his proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Actions. And to prove that these Images were instructive, as the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish are pretended to be, I shall only give this Instance. The same <hi>Jupiter</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Plutarch</hi> de Iside &amp; Osi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ride, p. <hi>381.</hi> Et Lilius Gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raldus, p. <hi>76.</hi>

                  </gap> no Ears, and by the <hi>Lacedaemonians</hi> with four Ears, whereas the ordinary Pictures of him had but two. Now it is a Contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and therefore held to be an impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibility, that one and the same person should have four Ears and yet but two Ears, and no Ears at all. When they therefore made him with two Ears, they would have him look like a man, and had no further meaning; but when they made him with four Ears, and no Ears, then they declared proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.


<pb n="110" facs="tcp:47487:68"/>
And the Moral, and Signification, <note place="margin">Id signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cantes domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natorem omnium au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dire debere neminem, sed aequè omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus patulas offere aures. Eum undi<expan>

destroyed Images, and taken away the sumptuous drnaments of Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thes. Which Example of hers (as the constant Report goeth) had like to have been put in pradice with Princes corses in our days, had the Authority of the holy father continued but a little longer.</p>
               <p>This is true modern Popish Cruelty and Barbarity, which according to the daily improvement of it under that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, would have far exceeded <hi>Irene's.</hi> She burnt her Father-in-Law, a man that was no kin to her, otherwise than by an artificial Relation, and a fiction of Law: But here it would have been an own natural Father, and Brother; in which case a sweet Protestant Prince, and a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutor of Protestants, only not a Slave to the Pope, had both fared alike. So that where Popery comes to be well set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, the Sacred Reliques of all those Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are in danger of suffering the most barbarous Indignities, who have been in their time either hearty Protestants, or not hearty and thorow-paced Papists. And neither the reverence of a Father, nor the dear Relation of a Brother, shall save them from being treated like the most notorious Malefactors, whom the Justice of a Nation thinks it self bound to follow and pursue into the other World, and to make examples to all fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ages. For blind Catholick Zeal knows no Body; but be it Peasant or Prince,

               <p>What English man, who had but one drop of true English Blood lest in his Veins, could have endured to behold this horrid sight? To see a parcel of cowardly Papists breaking up a Royal Monument with Sacrilegious Hands, and dragging thence a mighty Monarch, whom when he was alive, they durst not have look'd in the Face: to see those sacred Temples, which had been incir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cled with a Crown, and that puissant Arm which had swayed the English Scepter for almost forty Years, now reduced to infamous Ashes; and these thrown into the Water, as not fit to have a place upon God's Earth: and all this perform'd by the pure Zeal of his own Daugher, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly because he was not quite so good a Catholick as her self?</p>
               <p>I could not forbear shaking this Note a little, to try what Musick it will make in their Ears, who make way for a Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish Successor, out of pure Loyalty to a Protestant Prince. As they like this, they may proceed. For here they may plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly behold what blessed Fruits the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Holy Father is like to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce, and what true and laudable Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice will be done to Protestant Princes, by introducing Popery.</p>

And they may as well go and try their Foreheads up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this Monument of stone, as endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to out-face the other.</p>
               <p>These Cruelties never entred into the Hearts of Pagans, and therefore we have no foundation of a Comparison betwixt Popery and Paganism in this point; no more than we can compare Prince <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert's</hi> Iron Guns with <hi>Julius Caesar's.</hi> For this Murdering and Massacring hundreds of thousands upon the score of Religion, in cold Blood, and under the Sacred Rites of Friendship, are things found out in these latter <hi>Ages:</hi> And the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendious destruction of a Nation at one blow, is as perfectly a new invention, as the Gun powder it self, which was to have done that Catholick Job.</p>
               <p>All that can be done therefore in this Matter, is;</p>
               <p n="1">1. To shew what Cruelty the Pagans exercised upon the account of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</p>
               <p>And, 2. to shew that the Papists have far exceeded them.</p>
               <p>

                  <pb n="116" facs="tcp:47487:71"/>
The Pagan Cruelty, upon the account of Religion, falls under these two Heads.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Sanguinary Laws which were enacted, or put in execution against the Christians.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Outrages which were commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted upon them.</p>
               <p>In both these the Papists have much out-done the Pagans, as might easily be made appear from their own Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Councils, their own Historians, their Popes Speeches, particularly that of <hi>Sixtus Quintus,</hi> upon the Murder of <hi>Henry</hi> the Third of <hi>France;</hi> their Popes Bulls, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly to the Irish in their late Holy War; their Holy Inquisition, which has, I will not say, Ten Persecutions, but ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Persecutions in the Belly of it.</p>
               <p>Alas, the Roman Laws were but Cob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>webs, to those of Holy Church against Heresy. You may see some of them in the <note place="margin">28. Vol. Conc. <hi>Paris,</hi> cap. 3. p. 161.</note> Decrees of the <hi>Lateran</hi> Council, under <hi>Innocent</hi> the Third; Laws like our late Act for burying in Wollen, which will execute themselves, and extirpate pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stilent Northern Heresie, by a modest computation, in a Year and halfs Time. For it is Deprivation to the Bishop that is remiss and negligent, who must make room for another, that can and will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found Heretical Pravity: It is Death in that private man, who will not be an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>former: it is the loss of his Kingdom to


<pb n="117" facs="tcp:47487:71"/>
that Prince, who will not extirpate as fast as he can; which in that case is to be given to Catholick Free-booters, who, when they have extirpated the Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, are to possess it without any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction, and to keep it in the purity of the Faith.</p>
               <p>But because I would willingly do all Right to the <hi>Papists</hi> in this Matter, which cannot be done, but by a large and just Discourse upon the Subject; I shall here break off, making that the Conclusion, which is the only end and intention of this Book, and that my hearty prayer to God, which shall always be my poor endeavour among men.</p>
