         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </head>
            <p>IT ſeemed good to the God and Father of our Lord Jeſus, by a more than uſual method of his Providence, to put me into the Miniſtry (who am leſs than the leaſt of all Saints) not many years ago: And after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to call and ſend me from <hi>London,</hi> a place of Eaſe and Advantages, and from all the advantageous Proffers that were then made me, (which did bid fair for the World in conjunction with his ſervice) by the ſame unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable hand down to <hi>Northamptonſhire;</hi> and there to a place and a people that I knew not afore. Where it pleaſed him, in a ſhort time, not only to make my ſervice acceptable to the Saints, and uſeful to their edification; but alſo to own the labours of the meaneſt of his Servants with ſucceſs in the work of Converſion, for the manifeſtation of the excellency of his own power. So glorious a work of Chriſt upon the wheel, muſt needs be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected to awaken all the rage of Satan againſt it; which hath ſufficiently appeared in the various Artifices he hath uſed ever ſince to oppoſe, blacken and defeat it, and to overturn the Church, and tread me under foot.</p>
            <p>We were firſt invaded by him with thoſe ſtrange and unuſual Diſtempers on the Bodies of ſeveral, ſo remarkable as to the manner of the Diſeaſe, and the numbers of the Afflicted, that it not only amazed us, but ſtartled all others that ſaw and heard thereof; which hath given an occaſion to all the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections and Cenſures that have been paſt upon us ſince.</p>
            <p>The Deſigns of that grand Enemy of Souls were apparently theſe.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. To render me a ſuſpicious Man (verſed in ſome evil Art) both to the Magiſtrates and the People.</item>
               <item>2. To deter People from coming to hear me.</item>
               <item>3. To caſt an <hi>Odium</hi> upon the Afflicted, and make them liable to Suſpicion to be under no other Influences, but what were Diabolical.</item>
               <item>4. To terrify and diſcourage the Afflicted themſelves.</item>
               <item>5. To weaken my hands, and caſt me down in the ſervice of Chriſt.</item>
            </list>
            <p>But under theſe Tryals, the Lord afforded theſe Supports.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That tho' the ſtricteſt Enquiry was made, yet nothing of Conjuration could ever be faſtned upon me: Beſides, my Converſation known to ſo many in City and Country, baffled ſo ridiculous an Imagination.</p>
            <p n="2">2. His ſecond Deſign was, in ſome meaſure, over-ruled for good alſo; for the Noiſe and Novelty of the Diſpenſation brought many under the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Word, which probably otherwiſe would not have come. And many of them, that came to feed their Eyes on our Calamities, were reached by the power of God in his Goſpel.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Nor did he altogether prevail in his third; for the Converſation and Experiences of thoſe Afflicted; give a ſufficient Teſtimony to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:65071:3"/>
4. And as to his fourth Deſign, he is trampled upon; for the Afflicted meet with ſo many Conſolations from the God of all Grace, that they are comforted under their Tribulations with thoſe Comforts, wherewith they are enabled to comfort others. <hi>Bleſſed be the Name of the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. And as to my ſelf, under great Diſcouragements and Diſconſolateneſs, I was ſupported by the Father of mercies, by his powerful giving in of thoſe words, <hi>John</hi> 11. 4. and at another time with thoſe words, <hi>John</hi> 13. 7. So that they and I reſting on his Word, are made, through grace, quietly to hope, and patiently to wait for the Salvation of the Lord, under that duſty Cloud of Reproaches we are covered with; expecting, that in his own time he will expound that myſterious Providence.</p>
            <p>But when the Adverſary failed in this Attempt, he ſtirred up ſome to emit a railing Letter, reflecting on my Converſation; I know not where it was forged, but it was induſtriouſly ſpread by an ill Man in the Town up and down the Country, which, like a Squib, having ſpluttered a little while, puffed away to nothing. Some Friends hearing thereof, ſent down their Letters-Teſtimonials concerning my Behaviour, which ſhall be hereafter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted.</p>
            <p>Theſe Attempts being fruſtrated, he takes up other Inſtruments; for now he prevails with a profeſſing People to engage in the oppoſition. There were private grumblings and mutterings before amongſt them. Our Doctrine was too bright, our Faith too high, our Diſcipline too ſtrict for them: But this ſecret Prejudice burſt not forth to an open Flame, till ſome good Men took occaſion from my Ordination, becauſe it was not according to their Model, to cenſure that and me liberally to all ſorts of People; whereupon the Tongues of Profeſſors were now let looſe to cavil at every thing, and find fault with all our proceedings. Hereupon they were inſtigated to contend, quarrel, oppoſe, and reflect continually, terming our Faith a Fancy, our Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion a Noiſe, our Converſation and Diſcipline proud, ſtrict and moroſe; and affirming, that without doubt we were all under a Deluſion. By this the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant multitude were incenſed afreſh, and encouraged by theſe to go on in all manner of Raillery, Reproach and Reflection, as if their Tongues had been ſet on Fire from Hell.</p>
            <p>Being alſo ſurther galled with the Reformation the Lord ſtirred us up to in the Church, in our Perſons and Families, their Miſconſtructions, Miſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports, Cenſures and Revilings encreaſed, which were communicated to <hi>London</hi> and other places by Letters, that fled up and down very thick. They conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded I was too much followed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> A Spirit of Envy is dangerous, like Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powder, what will it not blow up Men to?</p>
            <p>Now came a freſh Aſſault. A young Man dark in the Goſpel, but confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of his own parts, miſſed by Pride and Ignorance, ſets up the Cry of <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomianiſm.</hi> No term was now too bad for us. Diſciples of <hi>Criſp, Saltmarſh,</hi> and I know not who beſides; which made many enquire into thoſe Books, they had not read nor heard of before; I muſt confeſs I had not for one: However, Dr. <hi>Criſp's</hi> Works ſold the better afterwards. This young Man made the minds of Profeſſors ill-affected towards us, and he had great oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:65071:3"/>
to inſtil his Inſinuations, by carrying a Pack up and down amongſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing Families.</p>
            <p>Our Tryals thus encreaſing, our Comforts and Advantages did ſo proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably, bleſſed be the Father of Mercies, and God of Comforts, who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted us in all our Tribulations with theſe Comforts, wherewith we are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled to comfort others: for ſeveral were converted, the Saints built up in their moſt holy Faith, Members were daily added, the Church greatly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed, ſpreading wide. And over and above all this, the Brethren being ſtirred up of the Lord, waxed bold by theſe Afflictions to feed the Church that was ſcattered abroad, and offer the free grace of God in Chriſt to periſhing Sinners, whoſe labours God was pleaſed to own very much to the praiſe of the glory of his own excellent power; to which there was added by ſoveraign grace a holy boldneſs in the Members of the Church, in their profeſſion of and teſtimony for Chriſt and his Righteouſneſs, ſo that the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my deſpaired of trampling their Faith under foot. This blew up the flame of Oppoſition beyond all Bounds: Now Craft and Deſpair joined with Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to ſwell up the Flood above all Banks of Chriſtianity, Prudence and Morality. Monſtrous Stories concerning us were invented, reported, impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and as credulouſly received and handed about again. Pulpits founded out againſt us. Coffee-houſes, Ale-houſes, Taverns, and Feaſting-Tables rung of us, in repeated ridiculous impertinent and notorious Falſhoods. I have often wiſhed that time had been ſpent in diſcourſing of heavenly things, and have oftner wonder'd what ſtrange Spirit poſſeſt Profeſſors now adays, and what would the end of theſe things be? I alſo with an heart full of ſorrow have thus reflected, and are theſe then the effects of a day of liberty?</p>
            <p>About this time Mr. <hi>King</hi> being ſent down, headed an oppoſing Party at <hi>Wellingborough,</hi> which had took the opportunity of a day of liberty to forſake the Communion of the National Church, which (by deſerting their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Profeſſion) they had for years embraced, and he more vigorouſly, than prudently, performs his Work thus.</p>
            <p>Firſt, He takes the imperfect Notes of a Sermon, which when he had formed as he pleaſed, he communicates to the Elders at <hi>London;</hi> then, as he himſelf confeſſed to one, employed Men to bring in ſhreds of Sermons, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther real, wreſted, or meerly invented, as might beſt fit his purpoſe. Beſides this, he galloped up and down the Country many Miles compaſs, for theſe two Ends.</p>
            <p n="1">1. To incenſe the Miniſters againſt us, that lived many Miles diſtant from us.</p>
            <p n="2">2. To rake together all the Accuſations he could get, either from profli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate or prejudiced perſons, which hath afforded matter for the Libel. I do judge Mr. <hi>King</hi> had better ſerved the Lord Jeſus, if he had employed his time in preaching the everlaſting Goſpel.</p>
            <p>He was ſoon ſucceeded by a corrupt Party about <hi>Keiſo,</hi> who had been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected to have had an hand in keeping that Church in its Ruines and Deſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for divers years. Theſe uſed much the ſame methods with Mr. <hi>King,</hi> the Lord convince them of this great Evil, if it be his bleſſed Will.</p>

Then follows Mr. <hi>S</hi>—of <hi>Oundle,</hi> who was rather won over by the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of the Confederacy, than forced thereunto by any manifeſt Cauſe; for not long afore he had declared to Mrs. <hi>Woolaſtori, That Satan had tryed to create Difference between him and me, but that he hoped he ſhould never prevail.</hi> However, being got in, he was as active as any in the proſecution of the aforementioned Artifices. With theſe in the oppoſition coaleſced Mr. <hi>H</hi>—Mr. <hi>W</hi>—and divers other Miniſters, whom I never ſaw, nor they me; who notwithſtanding were pleaſed to govern themſelves by this Maxim, <hi>Report, and we will report it;</hi> tho' this is far from being a qualification of a Citizen of <hi>Zion, Who backbiteth not with his tongue, nor doth evil to his neighbor, nor taketh up a reproach againſt his neighbor,</hi> Pſal. 15. 3.</p>
            <p>At laſt, as the Head-Champion, appears the Gentleman at <hi>Bedford</hi> in greater Fury and Violence to oppoſe us, than either of the former. This he did twice or thrice publickly in a Town of great Ignorance and Debauchery, where the Goſpel had newly got footing, and had awakened ſome of the moſt Debauched; for which piece of Service, he had great Thanks given him by the Parſon of the place.</p>
            <p>Then he proceeded to write his Letters defamatory againſt us to <hi>London,</hi> to thunder in the Pulpit againſt us, to warn his Hearers and People from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving or hearing of us.</p>
            <q>—Precibuſque minas regaliter addit.</q>
            <p>
               <hi>Which may be Engliſhed thus:</hi>
            </p>
            <q>Like ſome certain piece of Majeſty, he mingles Threats with his Requeſts.</q>
            <p>Modeſty forbids me to relate all his injurious Actions; yet I hope, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all, I ſhould not only forgive, but forget all of them, were I but ſatisfy'd he was truly humbled for them. But by this time the Miniſterial Confederacy had ſucked into itſelf all the fitted Materials that were round about. Theſe now jointly united in repeated Clamors, and Letters of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famation, to expoſe us to the Nation, and the diſſenting Intereſt in general throughout the Nation; and all this to ſupport that pitiful Idol Self, that muſt tumble at laſt: for he hath ſaid, <hi>He will famiſh all the Gods of the Earth,</hi> and that is one of the greateſt of them.</p>
            <p>Beſides their being diſturbed at the exerciſing of our gifted Brethren, there fell an unaccountable Terror upon them, leſt we ſhould break their Churches; whereas if there be any thing that breaks them, it will be their own oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition. But ſurely they muſt be conſcious of ſome great Defects in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and of ſome irreparable Flaws in their Building, when they teſtifie their Fears of their being overturned by a ſmall handful of deſpicable People: Sure they muſt be but ſlightly founded and cemented, when they are afraid the preaching of the Goſpel will batter them down. It was more worthily ſpoke by a certain Servant of Chriſt, when the ſame Terror was laid before him, <hi>That he had not ſo carried it amongſt his People, that their Love to him ſhould be ſoon cooled; and he hoped he had not ſo meanly inſtructed them in the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:65071:4"/>
Truths of Jeſus, that they were in danger to be ſo eaſily ſhaken and removed by any, if they ſhould bring another Goſpel;</hi> or words to that effect. I cannot but teſtify how much I was affected with his admirable Prudence, Temper and Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and eſpecially his heavenly Converſation, (which adorned all the reſt) in a late Journy, which I undertook: But as to them it is apparent, that there is ſome ſecret Conſciouſneſs in them of certain unknown and unwarrantable Practiſes; which, together with the unſeen Terror of the Lord upon them, have hurried them into ſuch Fears. And 'tis evident that theſe Fears have precipitated them into all theſe Extravagancies, which have been ſo ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous to our holy Profeſſion and the Miniſtry.</p>
            <p>Such oppoſition to the Work and Goſpel of the bleſſed Jeſus; ſuch ſtumb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Blocks caſt in the way of the poor carnal and ignorant World, are fitteſt to be lamented with <hi>Jeremiah's</hi> Lamentations. May not the Lord ſpeak the ſame concerning us, as he did of <hi>Iſrael</hi> of old, <hi>Iſa. 5. 4. What could have been done more to my Vineyard, that I have not done in it?</hi> (He having granted us ſuch a day of liberty.) <hi>Wherefore, when I looked it ſhould have brought forth Grapes, brought it forth wild Grapes?</hi> And what thoſe wild Grapes are, we are partly informed, <hi>Ver. 7.—And he looked for Judgment, and behold Oppreſſion! for Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, but behold a Cry!</hi> Yet I am ſtill in great hopes the Lord will make good thoſe gracious words propheſied concerning his People in Goſpel-days, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 4. 4, 5, 6.</p>
            <p>But to return: Theſe Adverſaries at length underſtanding that ſeveral; who had received their Reports, inquiring of me concerning particular mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, received a true account, which cauſed them to begin to ſtartle at their proceedings. And probably apprehending alſo, that tho I had been hitherto ſilent, yet ſometimes I might be ſtirred up to vindicate Truth and Innocence againſt continued Aſperſions. To prevent me herein, or in any juſt Defence I might make, they give it out, and ſpread it with great Induſtry, that I was a Lyar, a Diſſembler, an Equivocator, a Man not fit to be credited, that would ſay and unſay any thing. Whereas all that have been and are my Intimates, know to the contrary; and can atteſt for me, that as well afore as after Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, I was reputed a Man of Plainneſs, Integrity, and without Folds of Mind; that always abhorred ſuch diſingenuity, and who would not witting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deviate from the Truth, unleſs through Ignorance, Miſtake, Forgetfulneſs, or Inadvertency. I ſhould ſcarce write what I do, were it not for this, that the Truth is now embarked with my good Name. But as for them it was apparent, that many Artifices they uſed, many Stories they raiſed to make the People believe this. I am informed it is the conſtant cuſtom of one in particular gravely to affirm this in divers places; adding, that he might gain the more credit to his Inſinuations, <hi>That he is my very good Friend, and that he can lay me in his boſom;</hi> which hath been the Preface or Concluſion of ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry Reports of his: Yet, for ought I know, the Party may love me, tho he cannot reſiſt the temptations of his Company; but he is not aware how much he ſubſerves the deſigns and intereſt of Satan therein. The Lord for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give him this wrong, I wiſh it heartily, as the Lord for Chriſt's ſake hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given me manifold Evils.</p>

By this time they were on tiptoes, imagining themſelves ſure of a full Conqueſt. Their triumphings were extravagant in thoſe companies, that were of their Kidney. Nor could they forbear their inſulting Language to others, with unmanly Threats, what Blows we ſhould have e're long; ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Letters of triumph to each other; in one whereof there was an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation to the Party, to whom it was wrote to pray for my Downfal, and the Downfal of the Church at <hi>Rowel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It cannot be thought otherwiſe, but ſuch Cabals and Actions had their Promoters at <hi>London;</hi> And a man muſt needs forfeit his Reaſon, that does not conclude, that there was ſome ſecret hand behind the Curtain in manag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all theſe Machines of fury and wickedneſs. As Letters poſted up apace to <hi>London;</hi> ſo no doubt they returned as thick, filled with encouragements. There is no place left to ſuſpect, but that there were Managers of the Party, who clap'd their hands, and halloo'd the giddy young People to ſuch raſh Undertakings. And 'tis as queſtionleſs, that ſuch undertakings had their grand deſigns. The Order of the Goſpel lay a bleeding to death already. And we, that durſt appear for Free-grace being ſufficiently blackened, it was concluded, none dare appear for it, leſt they ſhould be made Partakers of our ſufferings; therefore a bold onſet was publicly made upon the Faith once delivered to the Saints, in a certain book inched to the preſent Juncture of Affairs in ſpiritual matters, ſetting up a new Law, inſtead of the holy, juſt, and righteous Law of God. And now at laſt we feel their long menaced Scourges, and all follow together one in the Neck of another.</p>
            <p>The firſt was this plauſible book, laſhing not only at us, but at Religion it ſelf, and the Orthodox Profeſſors of it, over the Shoulders of D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Criſp;</hi> And then to ſecond it a virulent Pamphlet. And becauſe 'tis Cuſtomary in modern Duels to have thirds, there treads upon the Heels of that the <hi>Ketter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in-Inquiſition.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Such three Victories had the King of <hi>France</hi> obtained at once, his inſulting had paſt all bounds: And 'tis eaſy to imagine, how theſe puny Conquerors did alſo glory: <hi>But let not him that girdeth on his Harneſs, boaſt himſelf as he that putteth it off.</hi> The Cauſe is the Lords, and let the Oppoſers reckon their Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphs at the cloſe of the day; I ſhall only here acquaint them, we are kept through Faith by the mighty power of God, and are made hitherto to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice in the God of our Salvation, bleſſed for ever be his holy Name.</p>
            <p>The firſt alarmed more learned and abler Pens than mine, and drew them forth into the Conteſt, to whoſe management I leave it, wiſhing them good Succeſs under the Captain of our Salvation in this Engagement, againſt the Perverters of his Goſpel.</p>
            <p>The ſecond Aſſault falls more peculiarly upon my ſelf, and this Church of Chriſt to which I belong, and therefore I am engaged to act here in my own Defence, and theirs; or rather, in the Defence of what is much more va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable, <hi>viz.</hi> the Faith and Order of the Goſpel of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>And firſt I ſhall begin with the Libel. A Libel crammed ſo full with impious Prejudices, writ in ſuch an invective baſe Style, interlaced with ſo many Untruths, diſhed out and adapted for the meaneſt yet prophaneſt guſts,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:65071:5"/>
that it is juſtly to be abhorred by all Men of Underſtanding, Learning and Sobriety, as well as Men of Holineſs and Chriſtianity. The Authors, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all their bold and falſe Charges, yet have took care to keep themſelves obſcure, and have ſhrowded themſelves under a Cabaliſtic Name, not half ſo ſignificant as <hi>Smectymnuus</hi> of old, having thus excuſed themſelves, by fathering it on the Church of <hi>England,</hi> which aggravateth their wickedneſs, foraſmuch as they will not ſtand to what they have written, and bluſh to own their own Child, which they lay at other Peoples doors.</p>
            <p>The diſcovering the Author, will be more than half anſwering the Libel; and tho I cannot yet point out the very Men, yet I ſhall lay ſuch Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions afore the Reader, as will bring him very near the Covey.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Witneſſes at <hi>Kettrin</hi> proclaim themſelves ſo near akin to thoſe in the Libel, and conſequently to the Authors thereof, that it will be very hard to ſeparate them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. A certain Gentleman on the South-ſide of us, hath boaſted of this Book ſome months afore it came out, and promiſed to ſhew it to ſome, and to another promiſed a Book as ſoon as it was printed; beſides, that the ſame Gentleman has made it his Buſineſs for a long while to ride up and down the Country to gather Accuſations together.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The ſame Gentleman hath ſent a libellous Copy of Verſes to one of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pp</hi>—written with his own hand, very obſcene and ſcurrilous, (tho' he daſht out the moſt fulſom Obſcenity with his Pen) which came to the view of a worthy and judicious Perſon, who declared the Author, whoever he was, deſerved the Laſh. Perhaps theſe Verſes were intended to adorn the Libel, but, probably upon more mature Conſideration, they were omitted.</p>
            <p n="4">4. It is notoriouſly evident, that the Venders of theſe Libels were Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors and Church-Members, witneſs <hi>Bedford, Northampton, Wellingborough, Dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rington,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Pain</hi> of <hi>Oundle,</hi> who wrote to Mr. <hi>King</hi> for 50 of thoſe Goods, as I have his Letter ſtill to ſhew. And this they did, when Church of <hi>England</hi> Men abhorred to receive them, when brought to them to ſell by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known hands. Beſides, it was ſuch a ſort of People juſtify'd them. One at <hi>Spaldock</hi> ſaid it was nothing but Truth: Another at <hi>Wellingborough</hi> ſpake to the ſame purpoſe. Another at <hi>Olney</hi> deſended the Ribaldry of it, by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of the Prophet <hi>Elijah</hi> inſulting over <hi>Baal's</hi> Prieſts: So that People muſt put out their Eyes, that will not ſee what ſort of People were the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors thereof.</p>
            <p>We need go no further than the Libel itſelf, to manifeſt the Church of <hi>England</hi> had no hand in it. There is another ſort of <hi>Shibboleth</hi> runs through every Page of it, tho' mixt with a great deal of Impiety. I ſhall give the Reader a taſte thereof in ſome few Inſtances.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Page</hi> 4. Wherein they acquaint the Reader, <hi>That we have been with all Love admoniſhed by ſome or other of their Number almoſt weekly and daily,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It is plain from their way and manner of mentioning the <hi>London</hi> and Country diſſenting Miniſters with Mr. <hi>Holcraft.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:65071:6"/>
3. From the Form and Style of the Expoſtulation to the People at <hi>Rowel</hi> throughout, eſpecially that towards the Cloſe thereof, where they adviſe them to get a Paſtor amongſt them ſound in the Faith, and in the mean while to invite their neighbouring diſſenting Miniſters to take their Turns to preach amongſt them, till they can get ſuch an one.</p>
            <p n="4">4. They write, <hi>Page 3. That they adore and live daily upon the rich Grace of God in Chriſt,</hi> &amp;c. Tho' this Libel be but a poor Teſtimony of it, never did Fountain ſend forth ſuch bitter and ſweet Water as this Pamphlet does! And is it thus they live upon Grace? And is it thus they adore it? And does this naſty Book make for the honour of God's Grace? O <hi>Antinomians</hi> with a witneſs. Is this the effect of their zealous Cry for Holineſs againſt <hi>Antino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mianiſm?</hi> Holineſs ſtands in no need of ungodly Spirits and Practices to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend it. I may well ſay to theſe, as the Apoſtle did to the <hi>Jews</hi> of old, <hi>Thou that makest thy boast of the Law, through breaking the Law diſhonoureſt thou God? While the Name of God is blaſphemed among the Gentiles, through you, as it is written, Rom.</hi> 2. 23, 24.</p>
            <p n="5">5. It is remarkable, that when any of the ſober ſort of the Church of <hi>England</hi> have written in ſuch a Style, there has a vein of ſtrong and ſinewy Wit run thro' their Burleſque: But I muſt needs ſay of the Author of this Drollery, that he is ſo far from being fit for the Pulpit, that he would be hiſs'd off a Stage, and would never be accepted at <hi>Bartholomew</hi> Fair, nor earn his Bread there with all his Buffoonry.</p>
            <p>I muſt here enter this Caution, tho' I charge this Libel on a certain Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, who are the Warts and Moles of our holy Profeſſion; yet far be it from me to think, or perſuade others to think, that the diſſenting Party in general is guilty thereof; for I am perſuaded they abhor ſo vile a thing, and can ſcarce be induced to believe that any, naming the Name of Jeſus, ſhould wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low in ſuch Iniquity, tho' it be ſo. I alſo declare, that I think holy and grave Mr. <hi>Medwell,</hi> would abominate having an hand in the baſe Stuff. The ſame I think of worthy Mr. <hi>Clark,</hi> who (as I am informed) generouſly proffer'd to teſtify his abhorrence of the Libel under his own hand, when none preſent would ſecond him.</p>
            <p>I ſhall now proceed ſlightly to anſwer their Libel, tho', I hope, in another manner of Style than theirs.</p>
            <p>Firſt, They charge me with perverting of Scriptures. Theſe are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanced.</p>

            <p>2 <hi>Rom.</hi> 9, 8. Where God ſpeaking of the former and latter calling of the <hi>Jews,</hi> ſhews the ſuddenneſs of the work upon them. This is true.

1 <hi>John 4. 18. Perfect Love caſteth out Fear.</hi> That Fear I expounded to be ſlaviſh, ſinful, unbelieving Fear, and no other.</p>
            <p>In their prefatory Charge in matters of Fact, they ſtumble at the very Threſhold: For,</p>
            <p>Firſt, The diſſenting Miniſters of <hi>London</hi> in their Letter did not cenſure, but enquired of me, Whether ſuch and ſuch things were true? <hi>I</hi> returned my Anſwer according to their Queſtions, denying what was falſe, affirming what was true, and gave my Reaſons for my Judgment and Practice. This their Letter (of which <hi>I</hi> have a Copy) can teſtify.</p>
            <p>The Reports as to my laſt meeting with them are likewiſe untrue: For,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>I</hi> went voluntary to them, they did not fetch me before them, as is alledg'd.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Let the Elders themſelves ſpeak, whether it was their deſign authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatively to ſilence me.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>I</hi> appeal to them as Evidences for me, whether any ſuch thing was concluded, as bringing in Witneſſes againſt their next Meeting.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>I</hi> did not go out of <hi>London,</hi> until <hi>I</hi> had finiſhed my Buſineſs <hi>I</hi> came about there, and then what ſhould <hi>I</hi> tarry there any longer? One would think the Reverend Miniſters themſelves being Witneſſes of the falſhood of theſe firſt Reports, might juſtly ſuſpect all their After-Teſtimonies.</p>
            <p>Theſe Libellers, by an unadviſed blabbing out of what they have done con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Silencing, do declare what they expect will be hatched at laſt amongſt the united Brethren at <hi>London, viz.</hi> an old imperious <hi>Claſſis</hi> revived again: But it would be Prudence in them to tarry firſt for the generating warmth of Royal Authority, which <hi>I</hi> hope will never be.</p>
            <p>The Story of Mr. <hi>Holcraft</hi> is a Fiction, as divers in <hi>Cambridge-ſhire</hi> do at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt. I ſhall not mention what his Judgment was of a contrary Nature, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning me not long before his death; but he is now in Glory: And it is an eaſy matter to fix Stories on People when they are dead, when the Reporters know they are ſecured from having their Fictions contradicted.</p>
            <p>The Story of the two grave Miniſters, I ſhall conſider in its place.</p>
            <p>They ſpeak wickedly, to ſay that I make Diſturbances in the Country; but it is their Wickedneſs, Lying, Slandering, and a bloody Spirit of Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution they manifeſt every where, that creates the Diſturbance. Could they or the Magiſtrates either, have found any thing againſt me, ſave in the matters of my God, it would have been done afore now; for the exacteſt Scrutiny has been made in order to Indictments.</p>
            <p>Now <hi>I</hi> come to conſider the formidable Charge relating to my Principles and Doctrines. <hi>I</hi> have obſerved they have laid down four places eſpecially, where they pretend theſe Doctrines have been delivered, <hi>viz. Rothwell,</hi> and thereabouts. <hi>Kimbolton,</hi> and thereabouts. <hi>Wellingborough. Cambridge,</hi> and thereabouts. The Members and Hearers that uſually attend my Miniſtry in theſe four places, may make but one work of it, to confront their Teſtimony in each place reſpectively. Accordingly <hi>I</hi> ſhall methodically digeſt their Charge, with my Anſwers ſuited to theſe four Scenes; and the rather, becauſe my Principles and Doctrines (as they alledge, were delivered at <hi>Rowell,</hi> or there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts) are theſe following.

When <hi>I</hi> ſeriouſly weigh'd <hi>Iſa.</hi> 50. 8, 9. compared with <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 33, 34. and divers other Scriptures, <hi>I</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not yet but maintain and aſſert, <hi>A virtual Juſtification of the whole Elect of God, tho' not yet called in Chriſt their common Head ever ſince his Reſurrection:</hi> Eſpecially when I was ſo confirmed therein by the excellent diſcourſe of Dr. <hi>Goodwyn</hi> on that Subject, in his <hi>Triumph of Faith.</hi> And they that take away the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentativeſhip of Chriſt, the Foundation of our Goſpel, introduce a new Scheme of Religion, that I cannot find in the Bible. I do not ſee what need there is of all this noiſe about words, as long as I have conſtantly preach'd and affirm'd, That elect Sinners are dead in Treſpaſſes and Sins, and under the declar'd Condemnation of Law and Goſpel, till they believe; and that then, and only then, they are freed from that Condemnation; which I take to be actual Juſtification by Faith. As to Juſtification by Faith, I need not put my ſelf to the trouble to define it, as long as I am well ſatisfy'd with the definition given thereof by the Aſſembly and <hi>Savoy</hi> Confeſſion, by which I ſhall ſtand; and let, this ſuffice for an Anſwer to the following malicious Charges.</p>
            <p n="5">5. That Charge tacked to this, <hi>viz. That God loved us from Eternity,</hi> does very much confirm the Suſpicions I long entertained, that under the Notion of eternal Juſtification, they fought againſt eternal electing Love and Grace,

Theſe Jealouſies were firſt fomented in my mind, by obſerving that not only well-meaning People, violently with great Ignorance diſputed the Point, but Men of corrupt minds were the fierceſt in the Conteſt. And I further obſerved, the Arguments they brought, were the very ſame alledged by the <hi>Arminian</hi> Party, to decry eternal Election; and that made me the more willing oftentimes ſo to frame my method of Argumentation, as made many honeſt People think I held an elect Perſon actually and declaratively free from the condemnation of the Law before Faith, which was a miſtake. My ſaying and unſaying the ſame thing, is but a Falſhood charged upon me of the ſame piece with the reſt. The Country Divine, the Libeller mentions, was Mr. <hi>Chandler,</hi> for with him I had diſcourſe upon this Point; and when he objected my timing of Juſtification, I only replied, I never told him yet when <hi>I</hi> timed it, and continued on my Guard all the while. 'Tis true, <hi>I</hi> aſſerted everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing electing Love, which he told me afterwards was one of my Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies: But <hi>I</hi> think he may as well charge it on the Book of God, particularly two places, <hi>Jer. 31. 3. Epheſ.</hi> 2. 4. which affirm it in plain terms.</p>
            <p n="6">6. <hi>There must be no Works, becauſe God reſted in Chriſt,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> What always was contended for (which theſe <hi>Arminians</hi> and <hi>Amy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raldiſts</hi> cannot bear) was this, that no Works muſt come into our Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but Holineſs, as flowing from Faith, <hi>I</hi> have always preached and preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, conſtantly affirming, <hi>That they that have believed, do maintain good works, Tit.</hi> 3. 8. as hundreds can witneſs. But perhaps theſe Prevaricators judge no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to be preaching up of good Works, unleſs they be urged as Terms and Conditions of our Pardon and Juſtification, and Perſeverance therein, as the Terms of our eternal Bleſſedneſs.</p>
            <p n="7">7. <hi>Search the Scriptures, for in them ye think ye have eternal life; but ye only think ſo.</hi>

            <p>

Our Lord there ſpeaketh to the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> who themſelves judged the Scriptures to ſhew the way to eternal life; but yet they did not ſee he was the Perſon the Scriptures teſtified of. No doubt People may ſet up a bare knowledge of the Letter of the Scripture in the room of the Mediator, as it was the Caſe of the <hi>Phariſees.</hi>

               </gap>, and making it to ſignify a <hi>Comforter,</hi> in 1 <hi>John</hi> 2. 1. is, indeed, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the <hi>Grotian</hi> Divinity. I judge the Libellers would do well to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, that Chriſt there is repreſented as tranſacting above with his Father, and not with us. It is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>an Advocate with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi> And whether that be good Senſe to render it thus, That he tranſacts as a Comforter towards his Father, I leave it to the Judgment of judicious and indifferent Perſons. E're I part with this, I muſt fix a Falſhood upon the Libellers, who affirm, That two Miniſters diſcourſed me about it at that time; whereas it was Mr. <hi>Chandler</hi> then only ſpoke to me, and it was about the Senſe of that Scripture, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10. 32, 33.</p>
            <p n="11">11. <hi>Juſtification by Faith, is only a manifeſtation of it in our Conſcience.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> That I ſaid, <hi>Only a manifeſtation of it in our Conſciences,</hi> is falſe, like all the reſt. But that juſtifying Faith, in the infuſed Principle thereof is a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, ſupernatural Manifeſtation, or Revelation to the Conſcience, is unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niably grounded upon the holy Scripture of Truth. Thus ſaith the Lord, Hebr. 11. 1. <hi>Faith is the evidence or demonſtration of things not ſeen,</hi> but yet <hi>the demonſtration of the Spirit, and of power,</hi> 1 Cor. 2. 4. Chriſt as working this Faith, is ſaid <hi>to manifeſt himſelf,</hi> John 14, 21, 22. The Spirit, as the efficient thereof, is ſaid <hi>to teſtify of Jeſus,</hi> John 15. 26. <hi>To take of the things of Chriſt, and ſhew them to the Soul,</hi> John 16. 14. God the Father alſo, as the great Author of Faith, is aſſerted <hi>to reveal his Son in the Soul,</hi> Gal. 1. 16. <hi>And he that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth, hath the witneſs [or manifeſtation] in himſelf,</hi> 1 John 5. 10. with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers other Scriptures. Whence 'tis evident, That Faith is a Divine Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation in the Principle thereof; and the Act flowing from it, is the Soul's acceptance of manifeſted Grace; and Principle and Act are of the eſſence of ſaving Faith: Therefore it follows,</p>
            <p>Firſt, They that contend for their word <hi>Illumination,</hi> in oppoſition to Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptural terms, plainly prefer their own Phraſes before the Words, which the wiſdom of the Holy Ghoſt teacheth.</p>
            <p>Secondly, But more eſpecially they that exclude Divine-Illumination or Manifeſtation, from the Eſſence of ſaving Faith, either ſet up</p>
            <p>1. An implicit Popiſh Blindfold Faith; or,</p>
            <p>2<hi rend="sup">dly</hi>, Set up Faith to act without a Principle, which is monſtrous and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd; or,</p>
            <p>3<hi rend="sup">dly</hi>, Since in this Divine Principle of living Light, Chriſt comes into the Soul by his Spirit, and therein ſupernatural Power is communicated to the Soul, to act as a living Soul in Chriſt; they conſequently ſet up a power in Man's Soul to believe antecedent to Chriſt's coming to the Soul, and antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to this Divine ſupernatural Power; which is no other than <hi>Arminianiſm:</hi> And to allow it one minute before Chriſt's uniting himſelf to the Soul, is all one as to allow it him from his Cradle, or all three together.</p>
            <p n="12">12. <hi>A Man may ſimply, without Self-deſign, or Self-Intereſt, aim at the Glory of God, and yet be an Hypocrite ſtill.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> This is atteſted by judicious (or rather malicious) <hi>N. A.</hi> All the occaſion that he had for his falſe Teſtimony was, that there was ſomething
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:65071:9"/>
ſpoke to this purpoſe. That ſome may poſſibly perform ſome obedience to the Law, not to get worldly advantage thereby, or to gain the applauſe of Men, but becauſe God commands it; yet ſeeking to be juſtified thereby, it is not right, but hypocritical, becauſe it is not done in Faith in the manner that the Lord requireth it; and becauſe it is ſeeking to be juſtified by the works of the Law. The Apoſtle teſtifies for his Countrymen, <hi>That they had a zeal for God,</hi> viz. in obeying his Law; but, notwithſtanding, <hi>it was not according to knowledge,</hi> becauſe thereby <hi>they went about to eſtabliſh their own righteouſneſs, and did not ſubmit themſelves unto the righteouſneſs of God,</hi> Rom. 10. 23.</p>
            <p n="13">13. <hi>The Law giveth, 1. A little ſight of Sin. 2. A killing ſight of Sin. 3. An impious ſight of Sin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Here alſo is a little miſtake in the Information; for it was not ſaid <hi>an impious,</hi> but <hi>an impure ſight of Sin.</hi> Thus I explained theſe three Heads.</p>
            <p>1. The Law abſtractedly conſider'd, gives to the Sinner in a ſtate of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, in meer legal Convictions, a ſhort ſight of Sin.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reaſon.</hi> Becauſe they never ſeek out under the greateſt conviction of Sin, for any Righteouſneſs better than their own to be juſtified by; whereas if the Law, abſtractedly conſider'd, did give to a Sinner in a ſtate of Nature a thorow-ſight of Sin, he would never, ſo often as he doth, lean upon a Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation by his own works, nor pacify the rage of his Conſcience with his own doings. This the Law of God, tho' perfect in itſelf, cannot do to a Man in an unregenerate ſtate, in <hi>that it is weak through the fleſh; therefore God ſent his own Son in the likeneſs of ſinful fleſh, and for Sin condemned Sin in the fleſh,</hi> Rom. 8. 3.</p>
            <p>2<hi rend="sup">dly</hi>, It is but a killing ſight of Sin.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reaſon.</hi> This is plain from Scripture; for to this the Apoſtle witneſſeth, when he ſays expreſly, <hi>the Letter killeth, but the Spirit giveth life,</hi> 2 Cor. 3. 6. which killing Letter he calls, ver. 7. <hi>The miniſtration of death:</hi> ver. 9. <hi>The mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration of Righteouſneſs:</hi> to which may be added as further proof, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 9.</p>
            <p>3<hi rend="sup">dly</hi>, The Law in meer legal Convictions gives an impure ſight of Sin.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First Reaſon.</hi> The ſtate is impure, therefore all things in that ſtate are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure too: For Illuſtration thereof, I may at leaſt ſafely allude to thoſe paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, <hi>Haggai</hi> 2. 11, 12, 13, 14. but more plainly proved from that as well as other places of Scripture, Tit. 1. 15. <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto the pure all things are pure: but unto them that are defiled, and unbelieving, is nothing pure; but even their mind and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience is defiled.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Second Reaſon.</hi> A Conviction of Sin in a ſtate of Nature, hath a tendency to irritate Sin the more, proved from Rom. 7. 5. <hi>For when we were in the fleſh, i. e.</hi> in a natural ſtate, <hi>the motions of Sin,</hi> [or the paſſions or ferment of Sin] <hi>which were by the Law,</hi> [viz. convincing or reſtraining] <hi>did work in our mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers to bring forth fruit unto death.</hi> Whence it is evident, 1. That the Law in a ſtate of Nature, by its Convictions, doth ferment and irritate Sin. 2. That Sin thus irritated, <hi>doth work in our members to bring forth fruit unto death.</hi> To which agreeth what is experimentally recorded, <hi>ver.</hi> 7, 8. ſays the Apoſtle there, <hi>For I had not known Lust, except the Law had ſaid, Thou ſhalt not covet.</hi> But did this Conviction diminiſh or extinguiſh his Concupiſcence?

encreaſed it; for it inſtantly follows, ver. 8. <hi>But Sin taking occaſion by the Commandment, wrought in me all manner of Concupiſcence.</hi> Yet it is true, the Law, by God's Ordination, oftentimes reſtrains the outward Acts of Sin, even then when Sin defiles the Conſcience moſt with monſtrous Unbelief, and a violent eſtabliſhment of a Man's own Righteouſneſs. Now conſidering all this, it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniably plain to me, that the Law, abſtractedly conſider'd, in meer legal Convictions, giveth to the Sinner an impure ſight of Sin; whether we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the impurity of that ſtate that defileth all things, or the effects of ſuch Convictions.</p>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> There has been and is too much preaching of ſuch and ſuch legal Qualifications, not only antecedent to, but abſtracted from Faith. Nay, Faith itſelf is made no more of by them, than a work of the Law; and as for ſuch, I continue to maintain they are legal Preachers.</p>
            <p n="15">15. <hi>People muſt beware of three ſorts of Preachers, Babyloniſh, Graceleſs, and ſuch as mix the Law with the Goſpel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Suppoſe it true, I do not ſee how it can be charged as a Crime; nor how can any underſtand my thoughts ſo as to know whom I mean: But if Mr. <hi>King</hi> takes it to himſelf, I ſhall heartily conſent thereunto.</p>
            <p n="16">16. <hi>Saints under the Old Teſtament had no ſpiritual life, but in doing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> This I aſſerted, viz. <hi>That Saints ſince the giving forth of the Law at Mount</hi> Sinai, <hi>had moſt of their ſpiritual life from their obedience thereunto:</hi> And now I ſhall give my Reaſons for my Aſſertion.</p>
            <p>1. Tho' I grant, that all before the coming of Chriſt that were ſaved, were ſaved the ſame way that the Saints now are, <hi>viz.</hi> by the blood of Chriſt, <hi>the Lamb ſlain from the foundation of the world;</hi> yet whether they knew that way of ſalvation as well as Saints <hi>now,</hi> is to me a Queſtion, eſpecially when I weigh theſe Scriptures, 1 <hi>Pet. 10. 11, 12. Epheſ. 3. 8, 9, 10, 11. 1 Cor.</hi> 2. 9, 10. From which Scriptures, with divers others well conſider'd, 'tis evident to me, there is a far greater diſcovery made now to the Saints in Goſpel-days, than to them before.</p>
            <p>2<hi rend="sup">dly</hi>, I query, whether they had not much of their Peace of Conſcience,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:65071:10"/>
from their Obedience and Sacrifices? And this to me is undeniably proved from Scripture, when <hi>Moſes</hi> had ſet before the <hi>Jews</hi> divers of Mount <hi>Sinai</hi>'s Statutes, he intermingles this Caution, Lev. 18. 5. <hi>Ye ſhall therefore keep my ſtatutes and my judgments: which if a man do, he ſhall live in them: I am the Lord.</hi> I ſuppoſe few think Life eternal is meant here, and I ſuppoſe not Life tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral only; for it was not preſent death to break any of theſe Statutes, only ſome of them, therefore a ſpiritual Life muſt be alſo included. The ſame is quoted, and to the ſame purpoſe, <hi>Nehem.</hi> 9. 29. ſo alſo <hi>Ezek.</hi> 20. 11. And no leſs does the Apoſtle oppoſing the Life of Faith <hi>now,</hi> to that Life they had from Mount <hi>Sinai</hi>'s Covenant, inſinuate that then it was; <hi>He that doth theſe things ſhall live in them: but now the juſt ſhall live by faith,</hi> Gal. 3. 11, 12. Rom. 10. 5, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3<hi rend="sup">dly</hi>, It plainly follows, that ſo long as they obeyed and ſacrificed, ſo long they were quiet in their Conſciences.</p>
            <p>4<hi rend="sup">thly</hi>, I do not deny, but they had Faith upon God in the Promiſe, but in moſt of them it was weak, dark, and uncertain; ſo as little Peace of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience could accrue only from thence.</p>
            <p>5<hi rend="sup">thly</hi>, This is verified in the Experiences of many Chriſtians, eſpecially them that walk legally, who have too much a tang of that Covenant ſtill in their ſpirits. If the Queſtion was asked them, Whether they have their Peace of Conſcience always from Faith in exerciſe on the Perſon and Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of Chriſt, or from their Vows, Reſolutions and Obedience, with other marks they ſet up to themſelves, which are meerly legal; <hi>I</hi> am certain, if they ſpeak the truth, they muſt anſwer the latter, for this <hi>I</hi> have experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced my ſelf many years.</p>
            <p>6<hi rend="sup">thly</hi>, Suppoſe it at the worſt, where is the dangerous Error of it now a days, ſince we are not under that, but another Diſpenſation? And this Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion only comes in, to illuſtrate and magnify the Glory of this New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Diſpenſation. Then <hi>I</hi> added in Diſcourſe, that <hi>Iſaiah</hi> did not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand his own Propheſies, as well as the Apoſtle <hi>Paul;</hi> which <hi>I</hi> cannot but judge to be very true, tho' my words were then wreſted and trumpeted abroad according to the uſual manner. Let this alſo ſuffice as an Anſwer to the 11<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Charge in their order.</p>
            <p n="17">17. <hi>Sinners muſt come to Chriſt, and be united to him in all their ſin and filth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That the Goſpel invites Sinners as Sinners to come to Chriſt, and not as Saints, nor as little and reformed Sinners, is evident from the whole current of the Goſpel's invitation. Conſider <hi>Iſa. 55. 1. 43. 22. to 26. Iſa.</hi> 65. 1. compared with <hi>Rom. 10. 20. Rev.</hi> 22. 17. All ſorts are invited to come; heavy-laden Sinners, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11. 28. The like invitation, <hi>Luke</hi> 14. the maimed, the halt, and the blind, were to be brought in, <hi>ver.</hi> 21. and the high-way Sinners compelled to come in, <hi>ver. 23. I</hi> would fain know where and when People muſt leave their Sins, before they come to Chriſt. 'Tis true, inſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon their cloſing with Chriſt, they are <hi>no longer under the dominion of ſin, for they are under grace,</hi> Rom. 6. 14. Therefore all the Scriptures quoted for the Confutation of this are not to the purpoſe, not one of them proving that Sin can be mortified in a ſtate of Nature before a Soul comes to Chriſt.
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:65071:10"/>
But this Objection ſhews its Teeth, and diſcovers who the Objectors are, and what their deſign is, <hi>viz.</hi> To maintain a power in Man's will to believe, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, and turn himſelf, antecedent to Chriſt's coming to the Soul by his Spirit.</p>
            <p n="18">18. <hi>'Tis great comfort to us, when we were weak in the Faith, that Chriſt is ſtrongly believing in Heaven for us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> The Writer that came at the latter end, took this falſe alſo: For theſe Aſſertions were then laid down.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That Chriſt believed and exerciſed other Graces of the Spirit, whilſt on Earth, as appears from the Word of the Lord proved by Dr. <hi>Goodwyn</hi> in his <hi>Triumph of Faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. That thus his fulfilling of all was for the Elect as their Mediator, and that the holy Graces of the Spirit he exerciſed as Man, came within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs of imputed Righteouſneſs. This is undeniably proved in the aforemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned place.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That his meritorious Righteouſneſs in all its parts, tho' compleated on Earth, is now in Heaven, where the perſon of Chriſt is, who preſents it to the Father on Believers behalf, and he preſents Believers in it. And how Prejudice hath wreſted this, is evident from the Pamphlet. But <hi>I</hi> add: No doubt, tho' the Lord Jeſus has all power committed to him, for bringing his Sons and Daughters to Glory; yet he truſts his Father for bringing them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, which redounds to our benefit. This Aſſertion is grounded on his Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion to his Father, John 17. 11. <hi>And now I am no more in the world, but theſe are in the world, and I come to thee, Holy Father, keep through thine own Name, thoſe whom thou haſt given me,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="19">19. <hi>God the Father and God the Son are at ſtrife, who ſhall love Man beſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw. I</hi> remember well it was thus expreſt: <hi>There ſeemed to be an holy Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention between God the Father and the Son, who ſhould love the Elect beſt;</hi> grounded upon thoſe words, <hi>John</hi> 10. 17; with other Scriptures compared. They were Dr. <hi>Goodwyn</hi>'s own words, or very like them. And <hi>I</hi> know not why we may not uſe holy ſtrains of Rhetorick, to ſet forth that unfathomable and ineffable Love of the Father and the Son, in the Election and Redemption of Sinners, without being an offence to any Ears, but thoſe that are ſtuft with Prejudice. As for that Expreſſion ſaid to be uſed as the language of Chriſt to the Father, <hi>I will throw up my work of Redemption, if you will not give me theſe. I</hi> remember nothing of it, nor believe any thing of it to be true.</p>
            <p n="20">20. <hi>Perſons may ſincerely deſire Chriſt to be their Prophet, Prieſt and King, and yet be Hypocrites ſtill.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> This is a notorious Falſhood, whoever it is that affirms it: No Man of Reaſon, not blinded by Malice, can think me ſo void of common Senſe, as to expreſs my ſelf thus.</p>

            <p>The following falſe Stories came from <hi>Cambridge,</hi> which <hi>I</hi> have already anſwer'd to the <hi>London</hi> Miniſters. <hi>I</hi> ſhall prove how <hi>I</hi> am abuſed therein by divers ſubſtantial perſons: And <hi>I</hi> have here this advantage, that the miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken Objectors were ſpeedy in theſe Charges, whilſt matters were freſh in the memories of the Hearers, ſo that they then teſtified againſt ſuch notorious Forgeries; ſome whereof were pretended to be delivered publickly, others in private diſcourſe, accordingly therefore <hi>I</hi> ſhall divide them. The firſt were alledged to be ſpoke more publickly.</p>
            <p n="21">21. <hi>To preach Marks of Sanctification, is a Doctrine of an old Covenant ſtrain.</hi>

            <p n="22">22. <hi>Sanctification is no Evidence of our Juſtification.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> I have often expreſſed it, that ſome may miſtake a legal Holineſs for an evangelical one, <hi>i. e.</hi> They are apt to conclude, (as <hi>I</hi> once my ſelf was) that when they have ſuch a Catalogue of meer legal Qualifications to boaſt of, then they think they may believe, which <hi>I</hi> apprehend to be a ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be juſtified by the works of the Law: But as for excluding Faith, and its Effects, from being Evidences, <hi>I</hi> never did, nor is it my judgment.</p>
            <p n="23">23. <hi>Diſciples grieve Chriſt, when they mourn for Sin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> But the truth of the matter is this: <hi>I</hi> was thus gloſſing on that paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, John 14. 1. <hi>Let not your heart be troubled.</hi> That Chriſt ſeemed to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, that his Diſciples were ſo grieved at the news of his departure. And ſee, good Reader, how Malice has perverted it. There needs no proof of ſo plain a matter; therefore their ridiculous Confutation fights againſt a Man of Straw of their own ſetting up.</p>
            <p n="24">24. <hi>God is the ultimate Object of a ſtrong juſtifying Faith, and Jeſus of</hi> Naza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth <hi>the mediate Object of a weak Faith.</hi>

            <p>The three following falſe Charges were words wreſted in private diſcourſe, which they put upon the Rack, to make them confeſs what they pleaſe.</p>
            <p n="27">27. <hi>To believe our Sins are pardoned, is juſtifying Faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> To this purpoſe I have preached often. <hi>To believe on Jeſus for the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of Sin, is juſtifying Faith.</hi> And it was further added to this purpoſe, <hi>That ſaving Faith doth accept of and rely on the pardong Grace that Chriſt hath already purchaſed:</hi> Luke 14. 17. <hi>For all things are now ready.</hi> The Apoſtle declareth that the firſt thing he preached to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> as the foundation of their Faith was, <hi>That Chriſt diedfor their Sins according to the Scriptures,</hi> 1 Cor. 15. 3. And this they had been commanded to believe. I never ſaid that nothing was true Faith, but what amounted to that degree of poſitive unwavering and ſenſible believing that our Sins are pardoned: But this is certain, that God giveth to many of his Children great perſuaſion of the pardon of their Sins, and who dare deny that to be juſtifying Faith? I do grant, that Formaliſts and wicked perſons may have a falſe preſumption of the pardon of their Sin, but this doth not impeach the Faith of God's Elect at all. I only contend for that Faith that is of the operation of the Holy Ghoſt, which purifies the heart, lip and life. I think it hath not been ſo well done of our latter Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines, to depart from that definition of Faith given always by our firſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers, who as they lead the Van, ſo no doubt they had moſt of the Spirit of Chriſt. I judge it a ſafe way to form a definition of Faith from the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scriptures of Truth, rather than from the dark, low Experiences of weak Believers. This may be explained as low as is conſiſtent with Truth, for the comforting of doubting Souls. See the Apoſtles definition of Faith, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 11. 1. with many other places; and this Faith the Scripture preſſes us to, <hi>Hebr. 3. 6. 10, 22, 35, &amp;c.</hi> and this was the Apoſtles Faith, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 20.</p>
            <p n="28">
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:65071:12"/>
28. <hi>Faith is nothing but a Perſuaſion that my Sins are pardoned.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> This hath been anſwered already, and ſo I paſs it by.</p>
            <p n="29">29. <hi>Believers may not take Comfort in the actings of their Graces.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> This I do not remember, but believe it to be an untruth: For no doubt perſons have peace and joy in believing, and that is the acting of grace. The exerciſe of Faith and other graces as flowing from it, is very comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table: But this I have oppoſed, and others contend for, that inherent qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations without Faith can be the actings of grace, or bring any true comfort to the Soul.</p>

            <p>The following Charges are miſcellaneous, being chiefly Sentences dropt in private diſcourſe, miſerably rackt and tortured by the Libeller, and not ſo af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixed to places.</p>
            <p n="30">30 Charge. <hi>Whatever is ſupernatural, is ſaving Grace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> That that was ſaid, was this: <hi>All ſaving Grace is ſupernatural.</hi> And the <hi>Bedford</hi> Gentleman was then contradicted when he wreſted it.</p>
            <p n="31">31. <hi>Zeal is to be preferred before Judgment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> This alſo was a wreſting of words in private diſcourſe, and the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion was this: One in diſcourſe with me at <hi>Kimbolton,</hi> (who, it ſeems, was highly conceited of his judgment, becauſe, by his cunning, he had kept a Church from Order, Offices and Ordinances, for eleven years and upwards) aſſerted this, <hi>That Judgment was to be preferred before Zeal.</hi> I anſwered, <hi>Both did well together; yet that oftentimes they that had leſs knowledge, but had zeal for Chriſt with uprightneſs and integrity, did more ſervice for Chriſt than they that had knowledge and no zeal.</hi> I need not ſtand to defend this: For the very ſtating of theſe things aright, is ſufficient for their defence; yet I would put this queſtion to the Informer, <hi>What does he deſerve, that knows his Maſter's Will, and does it not?</hi> Luke 12. 47.</p>
            <p n="32">32. <hi>The Law ſets perſons a thouſand times farther off from Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Whether I ſaid a thouſand times, I much doubt: But this is certain, the Law or Covenant of Works abſtractedly conſidered, or Convictions meerly legal, drive the Soul either to ſink into deſpair, or elſe to work for life, and ſo attain to a ſinful ſecurity, both which lead far enough from Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="33">33. <hi>There are ſeveral genuine ſenſes of the ſame Scripture.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> This was alledged in a diſcourſe at <hi>Hitchin,</hi> that the Spirit of God may diverſly apply one and the ſame Scripture. Divers Inſtances we have hereof in Scripture, a few I ſhall name; that that's ſpoke prophetically, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 54.
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:65071:12"/>
to the Gentile Churches, is applied to the Goſpel and Covenant of Grace, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 27. Again, that place, Pſal. 3. 7. <hi>Thou art my Son, this day I have begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten thee.</hi> Several Divines apply it to the <hi>hodiè eternitatis,</hi> grounded on the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the Verſe, <hi>I will declare the Decree. [This day]</hi> is applied by the Apoſtle to the birth of Chriſt, <hi>Hebr. 1. 5. [This day]</hi> is affixed to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of Chriſt, <hi>Acts</hi> 13. 33. to the Aſcenſion of Chriſt, and ſitting down at the Father's right hand, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110. compared with <hi>Pſal. 2. Hebr.</hi> 5, 5, 6. The Apoſtle there intimates this ſpoke to our Lord at his entrance upon that branch of his Office his Interceſſion above, compare this with <hi>chap. 4. ver.</hi> 14. Hence <hi>Synopſis Criticorum</hi> on the place, <hi>Quaerunt occaſione hujus &amp; ſimilium loco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum, nam plures eſſe poſſint unius loci ſenſus litterales à Spiritu ſancto intenti. Qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam affirmant Alii negant,</hi> &amp;c. If the Holy Ghoſt ſhould apply any Scripture to comfort me, and therein endear Chriſt, his Righteouſneſs, his Laws and Ordinances, that's the genuine ſenſe of it to me. Another Inſtance I ſhall add, is <hi>Iſa. 53. 4. Surely he hath born our griefs, and carried our ſorrows.</hi> There, no doubt, is principally intended our Lord's bearing the vengeance due to the Sins of the Elect: But 'tis alſo applied to his bearing their Sickneſſes and Infirmities, <hi>Mat.</hi> 8. 17. To confirm this, I alledged 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 20. 21. whence I inferred, no Scripture is confined to any Man's private interpretation; but the Holy Ghoſt may apply the ſame to this or that Caſe as he pleaſes, and divers ways comfort ſeveral Believers from the ſame portion of holy Writ.</p>
            <p>That what's ſubjoined to my pretending to a Spirit above all, is falſe and injurious. The Queſtion in debate was this, Whether the Spirit be not the only infallible Interpreter of Holy Scriptures, which are of his own indicting? And whether he is not promiſed as ſuch, to the Miniſters of Chriſt? <hi>John</hi> 16. 13. Yea, and to all Believers alſo, (if they can truſt him) 1 <hi>John</hi> 2. 20, 27. I then and do ſtill maintain the Affirmative. But the vile Pamphleteers here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in manifeſt themſelves, and deny the Offices of the Holy Spirit, as they do blaſpheme him notoriouſly in another place.</p>
            <p n="34">34. <hi>He would be an happy Man, that ſhould break all the Churches in</hi> England <hi>to pieces.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> What was ſaid of this nature, was Table-talk in <hi>Cambridge</hi> with Mr. <hi>Worden;</hi> and I only repeated to him Dr. <hi>Owen</hi>'s words, as I had them from the mouth of worthy Alderman <hi>Love,</hi> a little before his death, without any addition of my own, as will be atteſted by them that ſat at Dinner with Mr. <hi>Worden</hi> and myſelf.</p>
            <p n="35">35. <hi>God never deſigned the Offers of Grace ſhould be made to all, but only to the Elect.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Thus it was expreſt in private diſcourſe. Altho' the Miniſters of the Goſpel muſt offer the grace of the Goſpel to all that hear them univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally without exceptions, becauſe they know not who the Elect are, yet God deſigns his offered grace and ſalvation only for the Elect, Rom. 11. 7. <hi>For the Elect obtain it, and the rest are blinded.</hi> I prove it thus: Chriſt died inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally only for the Elect, therefore the ſaving Benefits of his Death in the general tenders of the Goſpel, are intended only by God for the Elect; and ſure none will deny this Poſition, but a rank <hi>Arminian.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:65071:13"/>
Thus I have run over the Charges of the Libel as to matters of Doctrine, with ſhort Anſwers thereunto. And I appeal to the ſober part of Mankind, whether theſe Libellers have not dealt diſingenuouſly and unchriſtian like with me, not only in concealing their own Names, and the Names of their Informers; but alſo in wreſting my Words and Sentences, as well them of private Debates, as thoſe delivered in publick Preaching, and ſo forcing them to ſpeak their own Senſe, and then naming them my Doctrines; beſides many things invented, when nothing was ſpoken like them, ſo the world may ſee what ſort of Truth they are like to expect from them, in what follows.</p>
            <p>I believe what they caſt upon our gifted Brethren, carrieth the ſame falſhood and diſingenuity in its Forehead. However they are of Age ſufficient to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer for themſelves, and perhaps they may do it when they ſee it convenient.</p>
            <p>The account they give of our Practice is ſo filthy, ſo noiſom, ſo filled with abominable untruths, that I know not how to touch ſo much dirt without being defiled.</p>
            <p>At <hi>Wellemberough</hi> I railed at none, but vindicated my ſelf from a falſe Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſion caſt upon me.</p>
            <p>That Story of <hi>Bricksworth,</hi> and thoſe two of the <hi>London</hi> Miniſters, are egre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Falſhoods.</p>
            <p>The three Lyes I am charg'd with, of telling a Miniſter at <hi>Kimbolton</hi> Lecture, are juſtly chargeable on that Miniſter, who confidently averred before divers, 1. That I had no diſmiſſion from <hi>London</hi> before I was choſen Paſtor. 2. That the Letter of Diſmiſſion was not directed to them at <hi>Rowel.</hi> 3. That it was extorted from the Church at <hi>London,</hi> by the importunity of the people at <hi>Rowel.</hi> All three ate falſe, and can be contradicted by two Churches, and our Church-Book. But he was ſo blind, when he aſſerted theſe ſucceſſively, that he could not ſee how theſe contradicted and deſtroyed one another. This Miniſter (as I ſuppoſe) is he, that the Book ſtiles, <hi>The young Spark of a Bee,</hi> that falls to Club law preſently, conjectured to live on the South-ſide of the Plague between <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Rothwel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This ſame Miniſter would fain make a Lye of a plain Truth I told him from <hi>London.</hi> I acquainted him in my return home, that his Relations and Friends deſired there might be peace and accommodation between us, and ſo they did; I do not think they will deny it.</p>
            <p>As to my preaching at <hi>Kempſon,</hi> the plain Truth is this: When I ſet out from <hi>Rowel</hi> to <hi>London,</hi> I did not deſign to preach at <hi>Kempſon;</hi> but when I came to <hi>Bedford,</hi> I was prevailed upon by great Importunity to preach there, and that but few hours before I did; ſo that if I ſpoke of my not deſigning it to any before, I ſpake the Truth.</p>
            <p>Neither can they prove, that we ſollicit away any Bodies Hearers, for it is falſe; but if any come of their own accord, we have no Rule to ſend them away. If theſe things were true, why did not they prove them at <hi>Ketterin,</hi> when they pretended to prove all their matters. But are theſe indeed Goſpel-Miniſters, to murder the Reputation of a poor Man, and a Servant of Chriſt, at this rate? And alſo through him, to wound the Intereſt and Goſpel of the Lord Jeſus, which they ſay they promote; and expoſe our holy
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:65071:13"/>
Profeſſion to the ſcorn and contempt of the ignorant multitude. But 'tis ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily perceived what they are, by the Titles they give themſelves, or their Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complices for them, as in page 18. <hi>Little Bee, Spark of a Bee, Notorious Deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rado's:</hi> And alſo by their ſtrange hectoring Boaſts, and ſinful Vaunts. Was there ever heard ſuch wicked boaſting Language, fitter for the Mouths and Pens of the Hectors of the day, than ſuch as pretend to be Preachers of God's Word, and Defenders of his Truth againſt Errors? Do ſuch Boaſts as theſe become the Servants of Chriſt? <hi>As that they will ſting like a Scorpion, that they fall to Club-Law preſently, and give ſore Blows.</hi> How contrary is this to the qualifications of a Biſhop, <hi>That he must be no ſtriker,</hi> 2 Tim. 2. 24, 25. The Apoſtle rightly ſays, <hi>The Tongue is an unruly evil, it is full of deadly poyſon, James</hi> 3. 8. How much worſe the Pen, when managed by the ſame Spirit? For <hi>Littera ſcripta manet.</hi> But indeed ſuch a Spirit, ſuch Language, redun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant with ſuch Scum and Froth that tincture the Converſations of a young Generation of Men—made Miniſters, that are ſtarted up in theſe days, call for bitter Lamentation. I ſhall cloſe this Section with this true Remark up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, That they and their Cauſe, and Language, are much alike.</p>
            <p>What they publiſh concerning our Viſions and Revelations, is of the ſame tincture.</p>
            <p>That pretended at <hi>Oundle,</hi> I ſhall give an account of hereafter.</p>
            <p>That, whoſe Scene was laid at <hi>Rowel,</hi> is wholly untrue, without the leaſt colour for it, as will be atteſted by the Church and Hearers, if there were need.</p>
            <p>And alike falſe are the Reports concerning others, (as I verily believe) having made particular enquiry about ſuch Reports.</p>
            <p>This I evidently ſee, they cannot bear thoſe diſcoveries of love Chriſt has made to his Servants, and their profeſſion thereof, and rejoycing therein.</p>
            <p>As to their upbraiding us with our Oſtentations and Boaſts, I anſwer, <hi>We are taught by grace not to glory in our ſelves, but in the Lord and his Righteouſneſs.</hi> The Stories they bring to confirm it are ſo ridiculous and falſe, that it is time loſt to give them the reading. We can aſſure our Adverſaries, that tho' they think us trod under foot, we are made humbly to hope, our Lord will yet ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to our joy, when they that oppoſe our dear Lord Jeſus ſhall be aſhamed. <hi>We do commit our cauſe to him that judgeth righteouſly, who, for the oppreſſion of the poor, and the ſighing of the needy, will ariſe to ſet him at ſafety from him that puffeth at him,</hi> Pſal. 12. 5. And ſince they ſpeak of boaſting, I would recommend to their conſideration thoſe places of Scripture, <hi>Jude ver. 18, 16, 14, 15. Mat.</hi> 24. 49, 50, 51.</p>
            <p>Our admiſſion of Members has been ſo publick, and ſo many Members of ſeveral Churches, with others from divers parts of the Nation, have been Eye and Ear-witneſſes thereof, who have gone away rejoycing in the power of God that they felt; that I wonder at their Confidence, to invent ſuch non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſical Falſities, and then impoſe them on the world, when there are ſo many can atteſt the contrary: eſpecially that of the young Child at <hi>Rowel,</hi> is as ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous a Romance as ever was committed to Paper.</p>
            <p>I cannot gueſs what may be the deſign of the Libellers, in relating ſo much
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:65071:14"/>
Stuff and Nonſenſe about our Self-condemnedneſs, unleſs it be more and more to nauſeate the Reader's Stomach, and expoſe their own Folly and Wickedneſs. Their Narrations are ſo impertinent, as well as falſe and vain, that I ſhall do no more than ſhovel the Dirt out of my way.</p>
            <p>The Account they give of our Fits, is in ſuch a ſcurrilous ſtyle, in ſo inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent a Meen and Air, in that prophane and ſcoffing manner, that it is very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtable. To the afflicted pity ſhould be ſhewn, and miſery ſhould move com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion: But they, as unbecoming Men and Chriſtians, inſult over our Calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties with bitter Sarcaſms. It is an awful and tremendous diſpenſation, which ought to be revered, and not jeſted with; for it is ill Jeſting with Edge-tools. But theſe, like them of old, <hi>will run upon the thick Boſſes of his Buckler.</hi> They may feel, to their coſt hereafter, the effects of their bold preſumption, in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king ſport with ſuch an awful hand of God. Here they out do all their other Lines in Scurrility, Prophaneſs, and Obſcenity: But moſt horrid of all, (and which indicates the Writer to be ſealed with a judicial hardneſs) is that hideous piece of Blaſphemy againſt the Holy Ghoſt, about the middle of their Account; worſe could not drop from the vileſt <hi>Rabſhekah</hi>'s Pen: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, there is thruſt in a notorious Lye, reflecting on my Reputation, to cover their Blaſphemy. 'Tis well known, that I ſeldom either eat or drink any, or elſe very ſparingly for a conſiderable time, before I engage in the work of preaching. And I hope I can ſay, <hi>My Moderation is known to all Men.</hi> Over and above all this, they have daſht and brewed their Account with egregious Lyes, beſides divers Falſhoods of the like nature in other places. Can it poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly be ſuppoſed, that theſe Authors can have a dram of grace, the leaſt awe of God upon their hearts, or fear of God before their Eyes? But oh lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, that they ſhould diſcover themſelves to be Diſſenters too!</p>
            <p>It is remarkable, that when a People are engaged in a wicked Enterprize, the further they enter into it, the more they diſcover the Spirit of Satan in his various workings of iniquity. And this is obſervable as to this Pamphlet, that the Spirit that acts the Libellers all along thorough it, appears blacker and more cloven footed towards the cloſe.</p>
            <p>In theſe Enquiries to the Country People, it ſhews the higheſt quinteſſence of Falſhood, Calumniation, Malice, and murderous Deſigns.</p>
            <p>Here, and elſewhere, I am charged with four of the moſt notorious Crimes, <hi>viz.</hi> Drunkenneſs, Adultery, Jeſuitiſm, and Conjuration; which Crimes do not only touch my Name and Reputation in the higheſt degree, but my Life, and all that's dear to me beſides. They have left no ſtone unturned, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue their malice to my deſtruction. My good Name, of which I have been always very tender, they have rent and torn with manifold Calumnies. Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Artifices they have uſed to blacken me as the worſt of Monſters to the People. They have ill affected the Gentry of theſe neighbouring Counties with their falſe Suggeſtions, and malicious Accuſations. It is notoriouſly evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that from this Quarter aroſe all my Troubles at the Aſſizes. Witneſs the <hi>Cambridge</hi> Libel, the Letter to the Preacher at St. <hi>Ives,</hi> filled with more Raillery than Senſe, which was induſtriouſly handed among ſome Gentry there.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:65071:14"/>
Having failed in this Attempt, they in this Libel make their Appeals to the Rabble, ſuggeſting and aſſerting to them the moſt horrid Calumniations, to inflame them into Tumults and Riots, with a palpable deſign to diſturb the Peace of the Government, and to incite them to knock an innocent Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject in the head: But this quieteth me, and makes me paſs along with great ſecurity, to conſider, <hi>That my Lord ſitteth on the Floods, and turns the hearts of all as he pleaſes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What they baſely inſinuate of my ill Affection to the Government, is alike malicious and falſe. It is not convenient for me to relate how much I teſtified my Affection to the Government, before ever I ſaw <hi>Northampton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire.</hi> And I have made Conſcience ever ſince to pray for Their Majeſties, the King and Queen, in publick and private; by which King and Queen, I mean no other than King <hi>WILLIAM</hi> and Queen <hi>MARY.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The firſt Story they put down in their Enquiry, is the Vomit of ſome pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane Drunkards, licked up by them, and ſpued out again in this Pamphlet. The Arguments ſuggeſted to prove me a Conjurer, and a Jeſuite, are ſo poor and ſlender, ſtuft with ſuch contradictory malice, as they anſwer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
            <p>Any impartial Man of Reaſon, that conſiders matters without prejudice, may ſee the evident Folly of fixing that of Conjuration upon me from the Fits. If he had no other Argument to weigh but this, that they are my Friends, and not my Foes, that are generally afflicted with them. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurers and Witches do not uſe to act Revenge upon their Friends, but them they hate. How comes it to paſs then, that if I were ſuch a Conjurer, I ſhould only miſchief my Friends, that neither hate me, nor hurt me; and not mine Enemies, that do both.</p>
            <p>If my own Proteſtation may be of any Significancy, I can and do, in the awful preſence of the Searcher of hearts, proteſt and declare, That I never read a line in any Magick-Book, or Books of Conjuration whatſoever. I never had the leaſt to do with the Black Art, or any thing tending thereunto, but always dreaded and abhorred ſuch an impious Curioſity; my Acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, being the ſobereſt of Men from my youth upwards, can, in a Cloud of Teſtimonies, give in their Suffrage to defeat this Calumny, if there were any need thereof.</p>
            <p>Again, the Charge of Jeſuitiſm is alſo as irrational, if no more be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered than what follows. My Education and living with Mr. <hi>Langſton</hi> (who is well known in the City) from 18 to my 23<hi rend="sup">d</hi> year. My reſiding ever ſince, till I came to <hi>Northamptonſhire</hi> in one Ward and Neighborhood, (excepting one quarter of a year) where I was well-beloved of all ſorts, even of the higheſt Churchmen; tho' they knew that I was a ſtrict Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenter, that cleaved cloſe to my Principles in the moſt perilous times. The fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor and kindneſs of my Neighbors to me then, when they had the power in their hands to act otherwiſe, I do moſt thankfully acknowledge. Again, my being married to a virtuous Wife moſt part of this time with whom I have lived to this day. My being a Member of a Congregational Church, of great Note in <hi>London,</hi> all this while, amongſt whom I had love and eſteem,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:65071:15"/>
who alſo gave me their Letters Teſtimonial to the Church at <hi>Rothwel,</hi> when I came to the Country, which I ſhall hereafter inſert. Now I ſubmit this to impartial Judgments, whether there be the leaſt ground to ſuſpect me for a Prieſt or Jeſuite. Add to all this, that I have ſome time ſince taken the Oaths of Fidelity to the King and Queen, and lately renewed them with a Declaration againſt Tranſubſtantiation, and the Approbation of the Articles of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> excepting thoſe by Law excepted; and I do now profeſs, I did all candidly and ſincerely. One ſhould think this ſhould ſatisfy the Libellers, what is a ſatisfaction to King and Parliament.</p>
            <p>But now my hand is in, I ſhall do what lies in me to ſatisfy People, that there may be no colour of Excuſe left them for their After-Calumnies and Reproaches, therefore I ſhall conclude this Head with certain Teſtimonies of my Life and Converſation.</p>
            <p>I might, if I thought it neceſſary, have procured Letters Teſtimonial from divers Gentry in <hi>Wales,</hi> that knew my Education; but I think it not worth the while to trouble them. However ſome, that Friends have offered, I here ſubjoin. And firſt I begin with Mr. <hi>Langſton,</hi> who knew me from 18 years of age, and it is as followeth.</p>

            <p>By vertue of which, I was admitted Member of the Church at <hi>Rowel Febr.</hi> 3. 1689. was choſen into the Paſtoral Office, <hi>Febr.</hi> 20. and accepted thereof, <hi>March 7. I</hi> was ſet apart thereunto by Faſting and Prayer. So that hence People may ſee how they have been impoſed upon by thoſe Reports contrary hereunto, raiſed at <hi>Bedford</hi> and <hi>Wellemborough.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But our Pamphleteers are reſolved, it ſeems, to leave no means unattempted to overthrow me; therefore having done what they could to ſtir up the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, they make the laſt Eſſay upon the Members of the Church, and try if they can, by bitter Raillery againſt them, terrify them, to be Inſtruments of their Revenge upon me and our gifted Brethren. Hence it is, they conclude with an Expoſtulation and Advice to the People at <hi>Rowel,</hi> for it ſeems they will not vouchſafe to call them the Church at <hi>Rowel. I</hi> confeſs there indeed they ſhould have begun, if they had any thing to charge me with as to Errors in Faith, or wickedneſs in Practice. And <hi>I</hi> can aſſure them, that if yet they come to the Church, and not only give in their Names, but perſonally appear to proſecute their Charge, if they have any Truth and Honeſty on their ſides,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:65071:16"/>
and can make it out by good Proof, <hi>I</hi> queſtion not but it will be attended to. But as yet the Church of <hi>Rowel</hi> knows not whom to thank for their Advice, nor how to come at them, to conſult with them further about proſecuting their directions.</p>
            <p>And now you Libellers, and all your Abettors, it is now come to my turn to expoſtulate with you; ſuffer me therefore, in a ſpirit of meekneſs, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe unto you theſe following ſerious Conſiderations.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Is it not lamentable, that you ſtumble the Neighborhoods where you live, with your vain and frothy Lives and Converſations? Is it not (think you) a great ſtumbling to your ignorant Neighbours, that you diſcover ſo much fulſom Froth in your Diſcourſes, ſuch delight both within and without doors in Gaming, Pleaſures, Chambering, Wantonneſs, unwarrantable Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creation, and Proviſions <hi>made for the fleſh, to fulfil the luſts and pleaſures thereof? Rom.</hi> 13. 14. ſtudying how to be witty in your Jeſts and Reproofs, whereas you are expreſly forbid, <hi>Epheſ. 5. 4. ſuch fooliſh jeſting, which is not convenient.</hi> And you are exhorted, <hi>Epheſ. 4. 29. That your ſpeech ſhould be always ſeaſoned with ſalt, adminiſtring grace to the hearers.</hi> Is it not a ſhame, that you declare your ſelves to be ſo much every one for <hi>his own gain from his quarter,</hi> and do not witneſs that Self-denial that becomes your Places and Functions? And why do not you declare plainly, you ſeek not the Fleece, but the welfare of the Flock?</p>
            <p n="2">2. Conſider whether your whole Diſcourſe for almoſt theſe three years, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing laviſhed out in Raillery, Reproaches, Lyes and Slanders, and that in moſt places where you come, tends to the Edification or the Subverſion of the Hearers? Whether you do not rather gratify their ſinful Luſts, both by your Diſcourſes and Pamphlet, and form them up to Pride, Malice, Strife and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, than to heavenly-mindedneſs, ſpiritual converſation, and an holy walk? <hi>How ſhould they follow your Faith,</hi> when you are the greateſt Oppoſers of the grace of Faith in the Nation? And how dangerous it is for them to <hi>conſider the end of your converſation,</hi> which is Self and Sin, and not <hi>Jeſus Chriſt, the ſame yeſterday, to day, and for ever,</hi> Heb. 13. 7, 8.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Conſider ſeriouſly, Whether you have not expoſed Religion, as well by your former actings as by this Libel, to the contempt and ſcorn of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon People? Was it not the higheſt wickedneſs in you ſo to order the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal of many of them, as that they were put into the hands of Alehouſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keepers to vend away very cheap, or give them <hi>gratis</hi> to their tipling Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, to create them Sport upon their Ale-benches; and ſo render our holy Profeſſion to be the Mockery and Song of the Drunkards, and alſo diſpoſe of them to the poor harveſt Folks to read under Hedges? You have not only ſtumbled them from hearing of me, but your ſelves alſo, and every one that beareth the Name of a diſſenting Miniſter. You have not only made me odious, but Religion, our Profeſſion, and the diſſenting. Intereſt in general. Their hatred and ignorance will neither know or make any difference.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Search into your own hearts, and conſider by what Principles you have been carried forth in all your former oppoſition, as well as this Libel. Lee your Conſciences anſwer truly in the preſence of the awful. Searcher of hearts,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:65071:17"/>
as they are <hi>always open and naked before his eyes, with whom you and I have to do:</hi> And have they not been Self-gain, Self preheminence, Ambition, Pride, Malice and Revenge? Is not your Cry like the old Cry of <hi>Demetrius</hi> and his Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers, <hi>That your Craft is in danger to be ſpoilt, and your Gain like to be loſt?</hi> Let the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> (if you are aſhamed) anſwer for your Conſciences, and for all, <hi>Jam. 4. 1.

            </p>
            <p n="5">5. Conſider ſeriouſly what ſpirit you have acted in all along; Was it in the Spirit of Chriſt, or your own ſpirits? Nay, was it not in the very worſe dregs of your own ſpirits? Weigh this well, Whether you have managed your ſelves in oppoſition to ſuppoſed Errors, according to thoſe Commands of the Lord, 2 <hi>Tim. 2. 3. But fooliſh and unlearned queſtions avoid, knowing that they gender ſtrife.</hi> ver. 24. <hi>And the ſervant of the Lord muſt not ſtrive, but be gentle unto all men, apt to teach, patient.</hi> ver. 25. <hi>In meekneſs inſtructing thoſe that oppoſe themſelves; if God peradventrire will give them repentance, to the acknowledging of the truth.</hi> Ah! Have not you rather carried it quite contrary, even in your manifeſt fruits of the fleſh, ſuch as <hi>variance, emulations, wrath, ſtrife, envy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, back-bitings, whiſperings, ſwellings, tumults,</hi> &amp;c? 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 10. Had your Cauſe been never ſo good, yet your way of managing it has been enough to ruine it.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Was it the honour and glory of Chriſt that you propoſed at the end of ſuch Actions, or rather the advancement of ſome curſed Idols of Self? Any unprejudic'd Man that reads your Libel, can ſoon determine the Queſtion. Can you think this to be a likely way, even in a ſpirit of bitterneſs and perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, to reclaim us from thoſe Errors and Hereſies that you aſſert we are fallen into? Why did not you in prudence and good manners give way to the wiſer, learneder, and graver heads at <hi>London,</hi> to make the firſt tryal of their Skill? And why muſt you, with your printed Mint of Slander, impertinently iuterrupt them, and rudely anticipate their Eſſays; and by a malevolent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction of ſo bad a Libel with their <hi>Ketterin</hi> Viſitation, caſt ſuch an <hi>Odium</hi> upon them and their Proceedings, as cannot in haſte be wiped away?</p>
            <p n="7">7. Conſider, Whether it be not the greateſt Uncharitableneſs to judge, that the great Numbers converted by this erroneous Preaching (as you call it) are all under Deluſions? What is Converſion if this be not, that thoſe who were ſo groſly ignorant, are ſo enlightned as to underſtand and ſpeak ſo judiciouſly, clearly and experimentally of the perſon and undertakings of the Lord Jeſus, and Juſtification by him alone; of the beauty and excellency they ſaw by Faith in him; his ſuitableneſs to their wants, and the abſolute ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity they have of him and his righteouſneſs, through a deep ſight of their ſin and miſery, and a ſupernatural diſcovery of him? Is it not evident alſo, that thoſe who were formerly very wicked and profligate in their Lives and
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:65071:17"/>
Converſations, are now become religious, ſerious and circumſpect? Yea, thoſe that are afflicted, when they are themſelves, do adore the Doctrine of our Lord and Saviour, and are moſt awful of God in Chriſt. Theſe, many of them, live in your Neighborhoods; and no doubt many of them, by their holy Lives and zealous Profeſſion, leave a Teſtimony in your Conſciences for the work of God wrought upon their Souls. If you approve not of their Converſion, how came ſome of you to admit ſeveral of them into your Churches? It ſeems their Converſion is good enough, if they offer themſelves to you. Can you be then ſo cenſorious, to judge them all acted by a Satani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Spirit, and not converted? If many of them are true Converts, how dare you blaſt that Doctrine that God hath bleſt, to reach them with the dreadful name of execrable Hereſie? It is an old and a true Maxim, <hi>That the God of Truth never puts his Seal to a Lye.</hi> We can ſay in great humility, and ſelf-aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, giving the ſole honour to the excellency of the power that is of God, that thoſe deſpiſed Truths ſuch poor Worms as we have deliver'd in the Name of the Lord, and have been received amongſt us, have been ſealed and atteſted to with Fire from Heaven, I mean the Spirit of the Lord.</p>
            <p n="8">8. Conſider this, how groſly you abuſe us, to ſay we are againſt the Law of God. No, we conſtantly affirm, <hi>The Law is good, if a Man uſe it lawfully.</hi> Nor are we againſt the preaching of it as it ought to be preached. We al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways preach, the Law of God demands of Sinners complete and infinite ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, and they that will ſatisfie the penalty of the Law in their own perſons, muſt go to Hell to do it, ever to be ſatisfying, and never be able to ſatisfie; therefore there is a neceſſity laid upon Sinners to look and lean upon the ſatisfaction Chriſt has given: But you ſet up a certain imaginary Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, or legal Horrors, as terms of pardon and bleſſing. We preach, that the Law of God demands of Sinners univerſal, conſtant, and perfect obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, and will abate nothing if they will be juſtified, therefore they muſt believe on him that has perfectly obeyed: But you preach lower degrees of obedience, by I know not what new Sanction, as conditions of Juſtification. We preach up the good old Law of God, but you a new Law of your own invention. The truth is, you preach neither Law nor Goſpel, and that is very miſerable. I do affirm, we are not againſt the Law, nor the preaching of it on a right foundation. We cannot offer ſalvation to Sinners, but we muſt tell them, that by the Law they are under, they are Sinners, and by the ſame Law accurſed too.</p>
            <p n="9">9. Conſider, Whether it is poſſibly to be ſuppoſed, that that Church of Chriſt, that has had two ſuch Paſtors ſucceſſively as Mr. <hi>Beverley</hi> and Mr. <hi>Browning,</hi> can ſo ſoon by a young Man be run into ſuch execrable Errors, and noiſom Hereſies (as you are pleaſed to ſtile them?) And be all old and young ſo intoxicated, that there is ſcarce a part leſt ſound? for I can aſſure you, I know neither Man nor Woman that is diſeaſed with the Doctrine. And what can a whole Church, that have been reputed ſo judicious, and ſo holy, be ſwallowed up in Errors in leſs than 3 years time? The progreſs of Errors hitherto have been more gradual, ſlow and ſly. The ſudden growth and bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Hereſies have had always a tendency to dig their own Graves. Sure
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:65071:18"/>
Satan is not to ſeek for his Crop now, towards the latter end of the World. It is written, <hi>It is impoſſible to deceive the Elect:</hi> What, is there none of the Elect in the Church at <hi>Rowel?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="10">10. Conſider, whether <hi>Gamaliel</hi>'s prudent Counſel had not been beſt for you to follow? If this Work or Counſel be not of God, leave it alone, it will fall of it ſelf: But if it be of God (as I queſtion not but it is) it ſhall ſtand, and you will be found Fighters againſt God. It has been the obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of very prudent Men, that Errors themſelves being violently oppoſed, have ſpread thereby.</p>
            <p n="11">11. Conſider, whether theſe Carriages of yours, ſo ſinful and tumultuous, have been becoming ſo great a mercy as this Liberty we enjoy from the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, to ſerve God according to our Conſciences? And whether they can be conſtrued grateful Returns to God and Man for ſo great a Bleſſing?</p>
            <p n="12">12. Conſider, if the righteous God ſhould ever bring you again under the Harrow of Perſecution, how will you be able to lift up your heads, and plead for your ſelves, who have perſecuted your poor Brother, to the utmoſt of your power, with the greateſt Violence and Virulence? What if you ſhould come again to be expoſed and burleſqued in ſcoffing Satyrs, filthy Libels and Plays, loaded with all manner of Calumnies, Cenſures and Reproaches? Would it not reflect bitterly upon you, (if you have any ſenſe or ingenuity left you) that thus you have ſerved your poor Brother, who has done you no harm, nor any body elſe, unleſs it be his endeavors, according to his light and ability, to ſerve his Maſter? Muſt not you then be forced to make <hi>Adonibezek</hi>'s Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, <hi>As I have done, ſo God hath requited me?</hi> Jud. 1. 7.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> thought to have added more Conſiderations, but <hi>I</hi> ſhall not, for perhaps <hi>I</hi> write but to the winds. <hi>I</hi> ſhall conclude, <hi>Earneſtly begging of the God and Father of Mercies, if it be his bleſſed Will, not to lay this great Iniquity to your charge, but give you ſpeedy and ſincere Repentance, lest you eat the fruit of your own ways, and be filled with your own devices.</hi>

               <head>A ſhort Account of that famed Viſitation at <hi>Ketterin.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>HAving now diſpatched the Libel, <hi>I</hi> think it alſo highly neceſſary, ſince <hi>I</hi> am thus engaged to defend the Truth, the Church and my ſelf, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow ſome Animadverſions upon the Tranſactions at <hi>Ketterin,</hi> becauſe they have made ſuch a noiſe in the World; and <hi>I</hi> judge, that Order doth require, that firſt a brief and ſummary Account be given of what paſſed between the united Brethren and my ſelf. This cannot be well done, without looking back to the firſt Formation of this Union, and the Sentiments <hi>I</hi> had thereon.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I</hi> confeſs, when others rejoyced thereat, and concluded it to be of God, and of great concernment to his Glory, <hi>I</hi> then being filled with ſadneſs of heart, could not do ſo for theſe following Reaſons.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>I</hi> thought it but an ill time for ſuch an Union, and that upon a three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold Account.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. It was a time of great degeneracy and deadneſs.</item>
                  <item>2. As conſequential of this, a time that Profeſſors were filled with corrupt and ſelfiſh deſigns and ends.</item>
                  <item>
                     <pb n="33" facs="tcp:65071:18"/>
3. The Spirit was not yet poured down from on high, and therefore</item>
               </list>
               <p>Firſt, Times of Deadneſs and Apoſtaſie, I could not judge to be Times for great Actions.</p>
               <p>Secondly, When Profeſſors Ends are carnal and ſelfiſh, thro' the corruption of the Times, it is dangerous undertaking great matters then; tho' the glory of God may be pretendedly aimed at, yet the greateſt Sacrifice is to Self. <hi>Jehu</hi> could ſay, <hi>Come. ſee my zeal for the Lord of Hoſts,</hi> when it was a Crown and a Scepter he had chiefly in his eye, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 10. 16.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Such a thing as ſo great an Union I could not expect to be firm and laſting, till we were all more of one judgment, or at leaſt our Luſts more ſubdued; nor indeed ſuch an Union, till the Spirit was more poured down from on high, and theſe bleſſed effects follow thereupon: <hi>That the watchmen ſhall ſee more eye to eye, they ſhall lift their voice, and with their voice together ſhall they ſing,</hi> Iſa. 52. 8. <hi>Till they ſhall no more err in Viſion, nor ſtumble in Judgment, Iſa. 28. 7. Till the time, that</hi> Ephraim <hi>ſhall not envy</hi> Judah, <hi>nor</hi> Judah <hi>vex</hi> Ephraim, <hi>Iſa. 11. 13. There ſhall be no hurting nor deſtroying in all his holy moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,</hi> ver. 9. All attempts of this nature, without the ſpecial preſence of the Spirit, is like the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi>'s preſuming, under their Unbelief, to go up to the top of the Hill to take the good Land, when <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Ark of the Covenant was not with them; and it is no wonder if ſuch Attempters return back with ſhame, as well as the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> did. The Union propheſied by the joining of the two Sticks, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 37. 16, &amp;c. is there declared to be after ſuch an effuſion of the Holy Ghoſt. The Promiſe runs thus, <hi>ver. 14. And ſhall put my Spirit in you, and ye ſhall live,</hi> &amp;c. Which alſo is the current of the preceding part of the Chapter, then follows the Union foretold by the Prophecy of the two Sticks. We read in the New Teſtament, that the Members of the firſt primitive Church were of one heart, one mind, one ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord; but it was chiefly after the pouring down of the Spirit, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 36. 4. 24. 5. 12. To ſum up all: For extraordinary Actions, there muſt be an extraordinary Spirit; and a poor, ordinary, ſelfiſh Spirit, will not ſuffice for great Deſigns and great Services for Chriſt. Had not <hi>Joſhua, Zerubbabel, Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemiah, Ezra,</hi> been Men extraordinarily ſpirited, they durſt never have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted their building work, ſee <hi>Hagg.</hi> 2. 4, 5. That that made me then conclude, that this Union was untimely, was this becauſe I did not ſee the Spirit of God in a plentiful effuſion thereof lead the way thereunto.</p>
               <p>2<hi rend="sup">dly</hi>, My ſecond Reaſon was this: I obſerved, that the greateſt Numbers that were to make up this Union, were ſuch as,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Had forſook the Cauſe and Banner of Chriſt in a day of Adverſity, and ſince have wiped their mouths clean, and juſtified themſelves, and yet will be accounted great Diſſenters ſtill.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Such as had been for a long ſeaſon Strangers to the Order of the Goſpel.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Such as had not been only Strangers to it, but had conteſted againſt it, and perſecured their Brethren for keeping cloſe thereto: And obſerving theſe to be the moſt forward and zealous in promoting of it, implied to me no good deſign. Not but that I grant People may repent, and change their minds: But then that Repentance, if it be ſincere, (they themſelves being Judges) is
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:65071:19"/>
attended with a hearty loathing, a free confeſſion of, and a forſaking of their former ignorance and evil ways. That Rule of God's Word is a ſtated Rule to me in this Caſe, it being a Prophecy of what ought to be in Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matters in Goſpel-days, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 43. 10. the Prophet is directed to ſhew them the houſe in the deformity they brought it to, for their humiliation. The words run thus: <hi>Thou ſon of man ſhew the houſe of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>that they may be aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of their iniquities.</hi> Ver. 11. <hi>And if they be aſhamed of all they have done, ſhew them the form of the houſe, and the faſhion thereof,</hi> &amp;c. And ver. 10. <hi>Let them meaſure the pattern thereof,</hi> &amp;c. Whence obſerve, none ſuch can build aright for God, unleſs they be aſhamed of their former ignorance, diſorder, and evil oppoſing ſpirit. Now I was diligently hearkning and enquiring, whether theſe Gentlemen now, ſo forward for the Union, had</p>
               <p>Firſt, Ever publickly, or as much as privately, acknowledged their former ignorance, diſorders and oppoſition, and confeſſed they ſaw now more light in the order of God's houſe than ever before?</p>
               <p>Secondly, Whether the Ancients of them had acknowledged their evil, in their former and latter oppoſition to; and perſecuting and reproaching of the faithful Followers of Jeſus Chriſt, that kept cloſe to the order of the Goſpel under the odious name of <hi>Sectarians?</hi> Their ignorance, oppoſition and perſecution were too too publick, to the diſhonor of the Name of Chriſt, the ſtumbling of the World, and the grief of the Godly. And I did expect if their Confeſſion and Acknowledgment were true, it would be full as broad and wide as their Crime.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, I was obſerving, Whether as a ſign of true Repentance, they would pull down their old tottering humane Fabricks, meaſure anew with the golden Reed of the Sanctuary, and leave out the Rubbiſh, and build anew, according to the pattern in the Mount? That would have teſtified they had indeed been in earneſt; and ſincere in their Repentance.</p>
               <p>But inſtead of this, I never heard of as much as a private Acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, therefore I could not but juſtly ſuſpect, that their Judgments were the ſame as ever; and tho' they did in words give us almoſt all, yet then I judged their deſigns were deepeſt, and that they were to be treated with the extreameſt Caution. I confeſs we might have learn'd more Wit, if not from the Bible, yet from a Heathen Poet, who bringeth in one ſpeaking of the <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians</hi> thus:</p>

It is certain <hi>Ahab</hi> intended no good to <hi>Jehoſhaphat,</hi> when he enter'd into ſo ſtrict a league with him; his whole deſign appeared to be no other, than to engage him in that fatal War at <hi>Ramoth Gilead.</hi> It was obſerved of the <hi>French</hi> of old, what they loſt by plain fighting with the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> they always gained with an <hi>Overplus</hi> by their ſubtil Treaties. But I paſs on to my 3<hi rend="sup">d</hi> Reaſon.</p>
               <p>3<hi rend="sup">dly</hi>, I could not but upon good grounds entertain Suſpitions that all Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federacies with Men, that continue to lag behind in a work of Reformation, was unwarrantable, and of a dangerous conſequence. That Command to <hi>Jeremiah</hi> ſounded ſtill in mine ears, <hi>Go not thou to them, but let them come unto thee,</hi> Jer. 15. 19. I had obſerved, that all impure mixtures in the work of the Lord were forbidden, <hi>Deut.</hi> 22. 11. all linſey wolſey Garments under the Law were ſo: So alſo, <hi>Deut.</hi> 22. 10. was plowing with an Ox and an Aſs together. The <hi>Iſraelites</hi> experienced the bad effects of this, when they took many of the mixed multitude with them out of <hi>Egypt.</hi> As theſe retarded the work of the Lord, ſo they derived ſuch guilt on the whole Congregation, that the Carcaſles of moſt of them fell in the Wilderneſs. The Builders in <hi>Zerub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>babel's</hi> and <hi>Nehemiah</hi>'s days were more wiſe and prudent, they refuſed the offers of thoſe falſe Brethren to build with them, who ſaid, <hi>Let us build with thee; for we ſeek your God, as ye do, and we do ſacrifice unto him,</hi> Ezra 4. 2. And it is well they put them off, for otherwiſe their building work had never gone on. I alſo obſerved, that the Pillar of Fire and Cloud went always before the foremoſt Rank. <hi>I</hi> confeſs <hi>I</hi> could not but fear ſuch Unions was like wheel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Front into the Rear, and that is always loſing ground; then they that were in the Front, loſt the benefit of the conducting Pillar. A word is enough to the wiſe.</p>
               <p>4<hi rend="sup">thly</hi>, I had obſerved, that moſt of the Gentlemen of the Union, through darkneſs of mind, were ſuch as were no great Friends to the purity of the Goſpel; I therefore had my Jealouſies, leſt this Union was formed on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, whilſt they ſecretly undermined both Faith and Order; and tame us with the celebrated name of Union and Friendſhip, with a gag in our mouths, into a quiet Supineſs, whilſt they went boldly on to pervert the Faith, as well as Goſpel-order; and, as I feared, ſo it hapned: But, bleſſed be the Lord, that hath awakened ſome of his Servants to contend earneſtly <hi>for the Faith once delivered to the Saints.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>5<hi rend="sup">thly</hi>, I was informed, it was reſolved upon by thoſe Gentlemen, upon their entering into the Union, not to quit an hairs breadth of their Principles and Practices; but only they conſented Articles ſhould be drawn in ſuch a lax and looſe Phraſe, that both Parties might fix their particular Sence upon it, and ſhroud their different Sentiments under the univerſality of expreſſions. If this Information be true, it was juſt ſuch an abominable piece of Jeſuitical Equivocation, as muſt needs highly provoke the diſpleaſure of the Almighty, and render them odious to Men: <hi>If they thought thereby only to amuſe a certain Generation of Men, that have out-done them for many Years past in Politicks, their Prudence hath been ſtrangely overſeen.</hi> For they might eaſily perceive, thoſe quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſighted Politicians could quickly ſee through their Fig-leaf-coverings, and that their Nakedneſs would but the more appear to them.

And laſtly, <hi>I</hi> dreaded the deſign of this Union on the part of many, leſt it ſhould not be only a means framed for to jump into Benefices, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently into Power over their Brethren, when a favourable juncture of time ſhould pave them the way; but alſo a device of Satan to ſtop all the dawn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of new Light about Faith and Order. For it is well known we are not arrived to perfection therein; Nor ſhall not till, the latter day, glory is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummated. And it is alſo as undeniably evident, that, that glory muſt come in by degrees; and perhaps the firſt ſteps thereof muſt be advanced among a few deſpicable People. And it hath always been obſerved, the firſt daw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings thereof have been oppoſed, by the majority of them that made a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion. The grain of Muſtard ſeed in its firſt growth in Chriſts and the Apoſtles days, was attempted to be quaſht by the learned <hi>Sanhedrim.</hi> The Learning, Power, and Policy of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> were engaged againſt poor <hi>Luther,</hi> and the firſt Reformers. The united parts wiſdom and learning of the National Church, were engaged to oppoſe <hi>Puritaniſm</hi> in its firſt riſe, And ſince the Learning, Abilities, Power, Intereſt, Reputation, Holineſs and Profeſſion of the <hi>Puritan and Presbyterian Party, have been employed to cruſh the Congregational Order in its firſt appearance: From whence I obſerve,</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. That the dawning of every ſtep of Reformation began firſt among a few.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That thoſe few have been generally the moſt deſpicable; that the power and wiſdom of God might therein appear the more.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That thoſe few in their Teſtimony of Jeſus, were oppoſed by the majo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the ſame Profeſſion. And were always forced to ſwim againſt wind and tide of united numbers and confederacies, armed with fleſhly Powel, Wiſdom, Policy, Reputation, and a Popular Vogue. Read, and weigh well the 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> Pſalm to this purpoſe. It was the conſideration of theſe things aw'd me with the moſt dreadful fears and jealouſies, eſpecially being not a ſtranger to the complection of times, of profeſſors, and of the greateſt number of the united brethren; leſt this union ſhould prove a great mountain in the way of our <hi>Zerubbabel,</hi> attempting to overwhelm the day of ſmall things; and I had grounds enough for my fears. For I obſerved Profeſſors laviſhing their ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits forth into carnal joys and ſecurity, and propoſing to themſelves great and carnal advantages. I obſerved, that the Leaders of the People were like the Sons of <hi>Zebedee,</hi> for the right and left hand in the kingdom, in a carnal ſenſe. They could not conceal the pleaſant proſpect they had of rich benefices and maſtery; as if the Kingdom of God, and Glory of Chriſt, conſiſted only in Meats, Drinks, and outward Accommodations; The ultimate deſigns of ſome muſt be by a Grandee, in a jovial laxneſs of Spirit diſcovered; who when he thought himſelf perhaps ſure of his company, dropt their grand arcanum in words to this effect. <hi>That tho they gave the Independents good words now; yet, when time ſerved, they must truckle under.</hi> So that having conſidered theſe things, it is not much to be wondered at, if I was ſo ſhy to comply with the Union: For which piece of ſtubbornneſs, I was made a public ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample the other day at <hi>Kerterin.</hi>

I do not hereby in the leaſt reflect upon my honoured brethren, that coa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſced with them in this union. Probably their Charity were more exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive than mine, in judging others were in earneſt; and I confeſs it is ſafeſt erring on Charity's hand. Or probably they might think, that by frequent friendly debates with them about ſubject matters relating to the order of Gods houſe, that might ariſe <hi>pro re nath,</hi> an occaſion would be given of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fording them further light; which charitable intention of theirs I ſhould have the rather approved of, had this been done without the formality of Articles, and a certain airy pomp, that attended that tranſaction. But to the matter in hand. Has not time proved it a tympanous affair? Have they reformed one hair's breadth in their diſcipline, admiſſions, watch, care, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monitions, and cenſures; or in their underſtanding and preaching the truth as it is in Jeſus? Have not they rather gone ten degrees backward, and ſome others many ſteps back with them? But to add no more. Theſe are my reaſons why I diſſented from the Union. I thought I ſaw diſorders in the foundation thereof, and feared the continued progreſs thereof would under the wings of a favourable juncture <hi>lick itſelf into the enſnaring form of a Lordly Claſſis.</hi> This made me cautious to adviſe with them in any matter, leſt that ſhould be improved to further ſuch deſigns.</p>
               <p>Yet notwithſtanding all this, I ſhall give the Reader ſome account how I came to have any thing to do with them.</p>
               <p>I underſtood that they had received divers reports concerning me, and there were ſome of them I had a deep reſpect for, and I was willing they ſhould be diſabuſed, and all of them delivered from this great ſin, of ſinful credulity, if poſſible:</p>
               <p>Being alſo over-perſwaded by the importunity of ſome Friends, that I dearly loved, I went, the laſt Spring was twelve month, to viſit them, at their meetings; and there waited from 3 till paſt 4 under great indiſpoſition of body, reſolving to defend, whatever they ſhould object againſt our Faith, and practice according to my light; therefore I acquainted a grave Elder with mine intention, deſiring him to propoſe it to them, if he thought good: But he judging it not ſeaſonable, and they being employed about other buſineſs, there was nothing done at that time. I cannot but remark by the way, how it was reported by ſome of them, I did not tarry there ſix minutes, tho I continued amongſt them from three, till almoſt five. <hi>I</hi> went to the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try and heard not from them, till many months afterwards: And then I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a Letter inquiring of me, whether ſeveral things ſpecified therein, as to ſaith and practice, were true or no. In my anſwer thereunto, what was falſe <hi>I</hi> denied; what was true <hi>I</hi> acknowledged, giving my reaſons for my judgment and practice: To which Letter <hi>I</hi> have not received an anſwer to this day.</p>
               <p>The beginning of the laſt Summer <hi>I</hi> went again to <hi>London,</hi> and being ſet upon afreſh by Friends, <hi>I</hi> gave them another Viſit, ſtill being under ſome jealous apprehenſions, leſt theſe Viſits of mine ſhould give too much advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to the form'd deſign. <hi>I</hi> muſt confeſs they treated me very civilly, and were pleaſed to ask me divers queſtions, which <hi>I</hi> anſwered as my memory ſerved.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="38" facs="tcp:65071:21"/>
In the cloſe of this Conference Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> ſpake publickly, That he had many things againſt me in matters of Faith, but he had not his Witneſſes ready to prove them. I was amazed at ſuch a bold Accuſation, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the language and ſpirit he delivered himſelf in, I could not but plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly declare againſt ſuch Judicial Proceedings; yet being willing, if I could, to reſcue them from ſuch evil Credulity, in receiving ſuch falſe Reports con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning a work and Church of Chriſt, I frankly offer'd him, that if he would produce his Witneſſes againſt their next Meeting, I would be there ready to confront them. This he concluded impoſſible. Upon this I made a ſecond offer in the ſimplicity of my heart, being only deſirous to free them from the vexation of libellous Letters, and falſe Stories, that when he would be pleaſed to gather his Evidence to <hi>London,</hi> I ſhould make another Journy there, for the ſake of their quietneſs and repoſe, and thus we then parted. I heard no more from them, till ſome months after returning from a great Journy, that I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook for the ſervice of Chriſt, I was alarm'd all the way as I came home, with an intended Viſitation to be ſhortly at <hi>Katterin,</hi> by ſome Miniſters depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the <hi>Aſſembly at London.</hi> It was almoſt beyond imagination, what in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting Joy and Triumph the little Adverſaries of the Truth expreſt thereat in every quarter. They could have notice thereof a long time before the day by circular Letters, which likewiſe enjoined them to bring in all that had any thing to ſay againſt me. Whence I do obſerve, there was no fair dealing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned me. They had their matters of Accuſation and Witneſſes ready, but <hi>I</hi> muſt know nothing of all this, tho' it was earneſtly requeſted of Mr. <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liams</hi> at a Meeting at <hi>London,</hi> by a Brother that was with me there. Had they never been ſo authorized, yet this had been unjuſt in them: No Court pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to Juſtice, doth ever deny ſo righteous a Requeſt. The King's Courts always grant a Copy, or elſe read the Indictment, before the indicted Party is required to plead. All ſorts of Epiſcopal Courts grant a Copy of their Libel to the Party accuſed, with the Names of the Evidences, that they may know how to make their Defence, before they give in their Anſwer; yet this little piece of Juſtice muſt not be done to me. But to go on: When <hi>I</hi> came home, <hi>I</hi> found a Letter ſubſcribed by one Mr <hi>Godman,</hi> ſtiling himſelf <hi>Moderator pro tempore.</hi> The Contents whereof were to this purpoſe:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That ſince I had paſſed a Promiſe to meet them and their Evidences at</hi> London, <hi>when they ſhould give me notice thereof; they, to ſpare me that pains, had ſent ſome of their Company to examine them nearer home.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But here <hi>I</hi> ſhall pauſe a little, to beſtow ſome Animadverſions thereupon.</p>
               <p n="1">1. There are none, that have been acquainted with their Proceedings to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards me, will ever judge that it was to ſpare my pains, that Reverend Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> came down to <hi>Ketterin,</hi> but rather to expoſe me to the Country; therefore they might have ſpared that needleſs piece of Compliment.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>I</hi> never promiſed to meet them at <hi>Ketterin,</hi> nor any other place of the Country; nor were there the ſame Reaſons to move me thereunto. In my promiſe to meet at <hi>London, I</hi> deſigned privacy; but <hi>I</hi> knew any ſuch Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Country would expoſe us to publick obſervation, and a tumultuous noiſe.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="39" facs="tcp:65071:21"/>
3. My deſign in meeting at <hi>London,</hi> was to give the whole <hi>Aſſembly</hi> ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, that the Stories they had often received were not worth their credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting: And <hi>I</hi> had cauſe to queſtion, whether two or three would give them a true account of the matter, eſpecially one if not two of them being declared Enemies.</p>
               <p>But their Letter goeth on thus—</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That therefore they would deſire me to give them the Meeting at</hi> Ketterin <hi>on ſuch a day.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To the ſame Purport there came a Note without a Name, delivered by Mr. <hi>King</hi>'s own hand, in the way of an Apparitor, to meet them at a certain Ale-houſe at <hi>Ketterin</hi> on the appointed day.</p>
               <p>But, pray, why at <hi>Ketterin,</hi> and not at <hi>Rothwel?</hi> Muſt this Town be pitched upon, becauſe both the World and Profeſſors there were moſt malignant and diſaffected to us?</p>
               <p>But their Letter proceedeth—</p>
               <p>Laſtly, <hi>They deſired that I ſhould bring none with me, that might cauſe Publick Obſervation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And yet they had ſummoned in People from eight or nine Counties, and their Friends had greatly nois'd it up and down the Country; and yet ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, <hi>I</hi> muſt be debarred from bringing thoſe with me that might witneſs for me. Let ſober and impartial Men judge, whether this was fair dealing.</p>
               <p>This Letter, with all ſpeed, <hi>I</hi> communicated to the Church in their Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly; the Church, alarm'd with theſe Proceedings, appointed their Elders and other Brethren, as Meſſengers, to enquire into this matter, and to know by what Authority, and for what Ends theſe Miniſters came down, and ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned me their Paſtor before them: They alſo requeſted the aſſiſtance of Reverend Mr. <hi>Hayworth,</hi> who was then providentially caſt amongſt us, with the aſſiſtance of Reverend Mr. <hi>Suunders,</hi> and others.</p>
               <p>The day being come we met, and conſulted the Lord firſt by Prayer, and then with one another, and upon the whole of our Debate, concluded thus, That it was not expedient I ſhould appear before them for theſe following Reaſons.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. That my Appearance would be owning the Authority of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited Brethren, which was none.</item>
                  <item>2. The Authority of their Deputies, which was leſs, if poſſible, than nothing.</item>
                  <item>3. The owning of, and ſubmitting to all the Irregularities they had committed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Word of God, and the Principles of the Congregational Churches.</item>
               </list>
               <p>And firſt, It was the primitive Practice, if matters of Debate and Scandal aroſe, many Churches to ſend Meſſengers to that Church to compoſe that matter, if it could be by way of Advice. Thus, <hi>Acts</hi> 17. when matter of Debate and Scandal aroſe in the Church at <hi>Antioch,</hi> they ſent Meſſengers to the Church at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> for Advice, <hi>ver.</hi> 2, 3. compared together. So again the Church at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> ſent Meſſengers back with Advice, <hi>ver. 22. Then it pleaſed the Apoſtles and Elders, with the whole Church, to ſend choſen men of their own company,</hi> &amp;c. The Letters containing the ſubſtance of Advice, was ſubſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed by the Brethren, <hi>(i. e.)</hi> the Church, as well as the Apoſtles and Elders,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:65071:22"/>
Ver. 23. <hi>The Apoſtles, Elders and Brethren, ſend greeting to the Brethren which are of the Gentiles in</hi> Antioch, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> If any Elders might claim a Precedency ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſive of the Church, ſurely the extraordinary Apoſtles of thoſe days might put in for that Claim, but you ſee they did not. Other places <hi>I</hi> might al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, but <hi>I</hi> ſtudy Brevity, therefore theſe ſhall at preſent ſuffice.</p>
               <p>Now it is apparent, that the worthy Elders that came from <hi>London,</hi> offended againſt this primitive Practice, which hath to us the force of a Rule; for it being demanded, <hi>Whether they came from Churches in Goſpel-order?</hi> They could not ſay they did, and therefore were guilty of an Irregularity, which <hi>I</hi> could not by my preſence among them approve of.</p>
               <p>2<hi rend="sup">dly</hi>, According to the primitive Practice, they ſhould have come to the Church at <hi>Rothwel,</hi> for there the matter of Scandal and Debate aroſe; and if <hi>I</hi> had offended in matters Eccleſiaſtical, <hi>they were my proper Judges.</hi> It is appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, that this is according to the primitive Rule. <hi>Peter.</hi> that great Apoſtle, being accuſed of a ſuppoſed Crime, pleadeth his Cauſe before the Church at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> Acts 11. ver. 3, 18. compared together: So <hi>chap.</hi> 15. the Church at <hi>Antioch</hi> ſendeth Meſſengers to the Church at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> Ver. 3, 4. compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: So again the Church at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> Ver. 22, 23. compared; for again <hi>they ſend greeting to the Brethren that were at</hi> Antioch, accordingly they deliver'd their Letter and Meſſage to the Church, <hi>Ver. 30. And when they had gathered the multitude together,</hi> (i e.) the Church, <hi>they deliver'd the Epiſtle.</hi> Many other places <hi>I</hi> might quote to this purpoſe. It is remarkable, that all the Epiſtles of the Apoſtles <hi>Paul, Peter,</hi> &amp;c. are directed to particular Churches in theſe Epiſtles. To a particular Church it is give<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> in Charge reſpectively, <hi>to ſee that a Paſtor fulfil his Miniſtry; to warn the unruly; to comfort the weak; to ſupport the feeble minded; to caſt out a Criminal; to receive him in again upon repentance, Col. 4. 17. 1 Theſſ. 5. 14. 2 Theſſ. 3. 6. 1 Cor. 3. 4, 5. 2 Cor.</hi> 2. 7, 8. Nay, multiplied Inſtances to this end might be produced. From this primitive Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice the Rule of our Walk, the Elders that came from <hi>London</hi> deviated in ſeveral Reſpects.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Whereas they ſhould have come to the Aſſembly and Church at <hi>Roth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel,</hi> they never ſent to the Church, nor deſired a Church-meeting.</p>
               <p n="2">2. When the Meſſengers of the Church in the beginning of their actings at <hi>Ketterin,</hi> offered to them to aſſemble a Church-meeting with all ſpeed, where they might come, if they pleaſed, to declare their meſſage, and act their matters; but this they utterly refuſed once and again.</p>
               <p n="3">3. At the cloſe of the day, when they had finiſht gathering their Accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, it was requeſted that they ſhould ſend a Copy of them to the Church. This again they declined with expreſſions of Scorn and Contempt caſt upon the Church; ſo that by theſe proceedings of theirs, we evidently perceived their deſign was to hook away Judgment from a particular Church of Chriſt, and fix it in a <hi>Presbyterian Claſſis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again, As they violated the Rules of God's Word, ſo they alſo acted con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary unto thoſe Principles in the <hi>Savoy</hi> Confeſſion, which they themſelves all of them in their Articles of Union conſented to.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="41" facs="tcp:65071:22"/>
The Article violated, is the 26<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, which I ſhall repeat <hi>verbatim;</hi> then make my Remarks, and therein ſhew what Branches thereof they have acted re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant thereunto.</p>
               <p>[Article 26. Pag. 116.] <hi>In Caſes of Difficulties or Differences either in point of Doctrine, or in Adminiſtrations, wherein either the Churches in general are concerned, or any one Church in their Peace, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity and Edification, or any Member or Members of any Church are injured in or by any proceeding in Cenſures not agreeable to Truth and Order; it is according to the mind of Christ, that many Churches, holding Communion together, do by their Meſſengers meet in a Synod or Councel, to conſider and give their Advice in or about that Matter in Difference, to be reported to all the Churches con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned. Howbeit theſe Synods ſo aſſembled, are not entruſted with any Church-power, properly ſo called, or with any Juriſdiction over the Churches themſelves, or exerciſe any Cenſures either over any Churches or Perſons, or to impoſe their Determinations on the Churches or Officers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, By this Article it appeareth, that thoſe that concern themſelves in any Aſſembly or Meeting about any ſuch Differences, ought to be Meſſengers ſent from Churches, for it is ſaid to be <hi>(the meeting of Churches by their Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers)</hi> but the Aſſembly at <hi>London</hi> are not ſo, much leſs them that came to <hi>Ket<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2<hi rend="sup">dly</hi>, That they be the Meſſengers of thoſe that hold Communion to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether: But with many of them and their Churches, we can hold no Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of Churches.</p>
               <p>3<hi rend="sup">dly</hi>, That theſe Meetings be occaſional, and not ſtated, explained further by <hi>Article</hi> 27<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. But the Aſſembly at <hi>London</hi> is quite otherwiſe.</p>
               <p>4<hi rend="sup">thly</hi>, That they report the matter in difference to all the Churches concern'd, which I never heard hath been done yet.</p>
               <p>5<hi rend="sup">thly</hi>, That they are not veſted with any Church-power or Juriſdiction over the Churches themſelves, which they have uſurped indeed, tho' in word they do deny it. So that you ſee by the Word of God, as well as their own Article, their Proceedings at <hi>Kettering</hi> were Illegal and Arbitrary, therefore in Conſcience I was bound to declare againſt them by my abſence; it is true they pretended otherways, and that made them the more to be ſhun'd.</p>
               <p n="1">1. They pretended Love, when the whole work of the day was to expoſe me to the Country.</p>
               <p n="2">2. They ſaid they came not to act authoritatively, and yet they judicially received accuſations, read them aloud, examined VVitneſſes, by vertue of Deputation publicly in the facè of the Country. If they had acted by virtue of a Commiſſion from under the Great Seal, they could have acted no higher.</p>
               <p n="3">3. They ſaid they came in order to no cenſure, and yet ſome of them were ſo nimble, as to have proceeded to cenſure then, and others were ſo haſty to proceed to cenſure in <hi>London,</hi> that they could ſcarce in prudence be reſtrained. They ſaid they came to ſearch out Truth, and report it at <hi>London,</hi> but that was impoſſible for them to do in Juſtice and Equity, unleſs they had took my Anſwer along with them.</p>
               <p>Upon the whole I could not but iudge it a judicial claſſical procedure, and therefore durſt not in Conſcience countenance it with my preſence.</p>
               <p>If a foreign Power ſhould ſet up a Court in <hi>England,</hi> and require the Kings
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:65071:23"/>
Subjects to attend thereupon, their very Attendance, by the Laws of the Land, would be conſtrued a degree of Rebellion. This Inſtance is very applicable to the Caſe in hand, and may be well conſtrued a degree of Rebellion againſt the Lord Jeſus.</p>
               <p>My ſecond Reaſon for not appearing there, was a matter of Prudence: The matters of Charge and their Evidences they had ready againſt me, but I was ignorant of either; ſo that if I had appeared there, I muſt have been worried, and run down before the Country, having not any Witneſſes ready; nor could I, till I knew what and who would evidence againſt me: ſo that I had no publick way left me but this of Printing, which I choſe rather prudentially to have Recourſe unto.</p>
               <p>My 3d Reaſon, and a very weighty one, for not appearing, was, becauſe I underſtood there was a great enraged Aſſembly gathered together, that waited to make a Riot, therefore I durſt not go to affront and diſturb the Government under which I enjoyed ſuch Peace and Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quility. I had freſh in my memory, how many Citizens ſuffered about the <hi>Guild-Hall</hi> Riots. Beſides, I was adviſed by a Magiſtrate to this courſe. It is more than probable, if I had appeared there then, it would have been of dangerous Conſequence. Yet when I underſtood the Rabble was gone away, I went to them, and having entred my Proteſt againſt their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, left them. Had they given a candid Anſwer to the Propoſals made to them by the Meſſengers of the Church, they might have received a ſpeedier Anſwer. It was propoſed to them, Whether they came as a <hi>Presbyterian-Claſſis,</hi> or as Meſſengers of Churches, or as Friends; or, laſtly, as avowed Oppoſers. As a <hi>Claſſis</hi> we ſhould have ſlighted them, as we did; as Meſſengers of Churches they confeſs they did not come. If they had come as Friends they would never have come after that manner. If they had been above-board, and ſaid they came as Oppoſers, we ſhould have defended the Truth againſt them to their teeth, as the Lord ſhould have enabled us, provided it had not been in a tumultuous Aſſembly.</p>
               <p>One little Gentleman there preſent, would have proceeded to have paſt Judgment upon us there preſently, but I would have him ſeriouſly conſider the judgment the Scripture paſſes upon his Actions in the late Tryals, <hi>John</hi> 10. 12, 13. Tho' they declared at <hi>Kettering</hi> they would conceal their matters till they came to the United Brethren at <hi>London,</hi> yet two of them in their return home not only expoſed us in Preaching, but one eſpecially at <hi>Hitchin,</hi> publiſhed Heads of the Accuſations even to my Friends. A third, being my former Acquaintance, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried it like a juſt Man, I am ſorry he was one of them; however, I overlook it in him, and for his Chriſtian Carriage and Juſtice, render him my publick Thanks.</p>
               <p>Some weeks after this Tranſaction, I received from <hi>London</hi> a Copy of what was depoſed againſt me at <hi>Kettering</hi> in matters of Faith and Practice. I ſhall expoſe it to the World <hi>verba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tim,</hi> becauſe I know there is a great noiſe about it, as moſt conceive more dreadful of it than it is, together with the Witneſſes Names, that they may have the publick Honor they aſpire to.</p>
               <p>The Laws of Language and of the Land allow me to call them Informers, who witneſs againſt a Man in matters of Religion, but the Reverence I bear towards ſome of them forbids me that Term. Then I ſhall print-my Anſwer digeſted together, with their Accuſations, into ſome general Heads. Under every general Head, I ſhall make bold to make ſome Reflections, to evince what Truth of the Goſpel is ſtruck at, annexing thereunto a ſhort Defence thereof, and it is as followeth:</p>

The Law doth not prepare for Converſion, the Spirit of God doth not make uſe of the Law in order to Converſion—Atteſted by Mr. <hi>Chandler,</hi> Mr. <hi>Tomlins</hi> of <hi>Ampthil,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Holledge</hi> of <hi>Kimbolton.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>D.</hi> objected in his Sermon, But the Law is ſaid to convert. To this he anſwer'd, That it is the Law of the Goſpel, which is this, <hi>I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy</hi>—Mr. <hi>Chandler.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Law cannot convert, becauſe the works of the Law are under a curſe to the Soul—Witneſſed by Mr. <hi>Chandler,</hi> who engaged to produce the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of Mr. <hi>Acock</hi> of <hi>Cayſoe.</hi> The Law gives an impious ſight of Sin—Mr. <hi>Moor</hi> and Mr. <hi>Holledge</hi> Witneſſes.</p>
               <p>All that the Law doth, is to drive Perſons further from Chriſt, and make ſome go away and hang themſelves—Mr. <hi>Ley.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>D.</hi> preached, Believe not others who propheſie Lyes in the Name of the Lord, who ever wears a rough Garment to deceive, and tell you of <hi>John Baptiſt</hi>'s preparing the way, and preaching his Roughneſs, his Repentance, his preparatory Works, and you muſt bring theſe Qualifications; they propheſie Lyes in the Name of the Lord: Perſons Miſery is their Qualification—Mr. <hi>King,</hi> who took it in writing from his own mouth.</p>
               <p>Such as preach up preparatory Works are legal Preachers, hinder Peoples comfort, and keep them under bondage; we ſhould begin with high confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in Chriſt, and hold it faſt unto the end—Mr. <hi>King.</hi>

               <p>Here is the Redeemer; Ay, ſaith the Soul, but <hi>I</hi> muſt be humbled more, and pray more. <hi>I</hi> ſay, you may repent, and be damned, for this is ſlighting the Goſpel: Do you know how much you would have before you come to Chriſt—Mr. <hi>Negus.</hi> Sinners muſt come to Chriſt immediately, and be uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to him in all their Sins and Filth—Mr. <hi>Carlile.</hi> Some hold there muſt be preparatory Works, which is a ſtumbling block—Mr. <hi>Ainſcomb.</hi> The Spirit convinceth of no Sin but Unbelief—Mr. <hi>Terrey</hi> the Miniſter.</p>

               <p>A Perſon may ſincerely deſire after Holineſs, and yet be nothing; nay, they may deſire Chriſt to reign over them, and yet not be ſavingly convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced: When then are you ſavingly convinced?

               </p>
               <p>At <hi>Willingham</hi> he preached, That Chriſtians muſt not try themſelves by marks and ſigns of Grace; this is, as if a perſon ſhould ſhut the doors and windows of his houſe to let in more light, and produced <hi>Matth.</hi> 12. 38, 39. to reprove this way of Heart-examination, which he ſaid lay with awe upon his ſpirit, and he could not but mention it, <hi>viz.

Sanctification is no Evidence of Juſtification—Mr. <hi>Bland;</hi> 'twas alſo ſaid Mr. <hi>Hunt</hi> would atteſt the ſame.</p>
               <p>He preaching ſaid, How came the Covenant of Works, and the Elect un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it? It was to illuſtrate the electing Love of God, and not to make the Elect happy. The Law entred, that the Offence might abound. The Law was too weak, when Man was in his beſt eſtate to reign over him to eternal life.—Mr. <hi>Chandler,</hi> who took it from his mouth in writing.</p>
               <p>That Believers under the Law had their life from their doing, and they had no longer life than when they were crying, weeping and groaning; witneſſed by Mr. <hi>Robert Page,</hi> who entring into Conference with Mr. <hi>Davis</hi> about it, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected <hi>Iſa. 53. 5. He was wounded,</hi> &amp;c. and therefore the Prophet believed on Chriſt. To which Mr. <hi>D.</hi> replied, the Prophet did not underſtand what he ſaid—Mr. <hi>Robert Page.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Believers under the Law had no real ſight of Chriſt—Mr. <hi>Chandler.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When you are diſcouraged with Unbelief in Duty, if you can but believe that Jeſus is there ſtrongly believing for you, this raiſeth your Faith; if you ſee Chriſt loves mightily for you, this draws forth your love—Mr. <hi>King,</hi> who heard him.</p>
               <p>You would mourn, you would weep; no, Chriſt hath mourned, and he hath wept, and you have nothing to do but accept his Grace; the Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs by which thou and I muſt be juſtified, is Chriſt's fulfilling <hi>Adam</hi>'s Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and Mount <hi>Sinai</hi>'s Covenant, and the Covenant of Grace—Mr. <hi>Carlile.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For any to look to their Sanctification, was a hindrance to their cloſing with Chriſt—Mr. <hi>Worden</hi> the Miniſter.</p>
               <p>Toe fear Sin, is the way to increaſe it—Mr. <hi>Holledge.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In Prayer he ſaid, Lord, we ſtand before thee without Sin. And in his Sermon he objected, Some ſay we are againſt praying for pardon of Sin: To which he anſwered, Altho' we are pardoned, yet it is our Duty to pray for Pardon, for the Honour of the Father, and of the Son—Mr. <hi>Chandler.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Lord, thou lookeſt upon thy People even when they are ſinning againſt thee, and ſayſt; Thou art all fair my Love, there is no ſpot in thee. Again, there muſt be no more Conſcience of Sin in Believers—Mr. <hi>Carlile.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There are five times of Chriſt's eſpecial Interceſſion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Chriſt ſaith, I cannot ſo heartily pray for my People, when they ſneak from their Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion—Mr. <hi>Sheppard,</hi> Mr. <hi>Chandler,</hi> Mr. <hi>Holledge,</hi> Mr. <hi>Bland.</hi>

               <p>The Offers of Grace muſt be made only to the Elect—Mr. <hi>Chandler.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Chriſt and Believers are one in Interceſſion: Believers that take comfort in Promiſes miſtake the way, but we muſt flie to Chriſt—Mr. <hi>Bland:</hi> 'twas alſo ſaid Mr. <hi>Hunt</hi> will atteſt it too.

                     <p>I <hi>Have received the Informations given in to the Ministers at</hi> Ketterin; <hi>And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I anſwer them, I think it neceſſary to premiſe theſe following Obſervations.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1. That allowing the Inquiſition at <hi>Ketterin</hi> to be regular, which I am not yet convinced of; Yet I cannot but ſay, that I have met from Brethren with harder treatment in ſome reſpects, than the Martyrs of old did from the bloody Papiſts: For they condemned them for Heretics, either from what they found of their Tenents in print, or what the Martyrs themſelves acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be their Judgment: But I have been expoſed to the Country, which hath the nature of a cenſure, for mingled, perverted, and half Sentences de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered, I know not how long ſince; as it is pretended in public preaching: Or for wreſted words in private diſcourſe, which has been very diſingenuous, and unchriſtian-like.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. They ſhould have examined more ſtrictly the credibility of the Witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, ſince it is very much to be ſuſpected; becauſe it may appear to ſober and impartial men to be one entire piece of Malice, carried on againſt me from firſt to laſt; eſpecially conſidering</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That all the Informants have teſtified towards me a very ill ſpirit all along.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. That they have broke the rules of Chriſt, in publiſhing thoſe ſuppoſed faults up and down the Country, and ſending them in Letters to <hi>London,</hi> and very few of them acquainted me with any thing.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. It is too evident, that the ſame that witneſſed at <hi>Ketterin,</hi> and the ſame alſo that have had a hand directly or indirectly in the Libel; which will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear by comparing their Informations and the Libel together. A Libel writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in ſo impious a Stile, with ſuch a villanous deſign to incenſe the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and inflame the Country againſt me, doth ſufficiently proclaim the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veterate malice of the Authors and Witneſſes, which are the ſame.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>Premiſe,</hi> That to many things charged there is but one Witneſs, contrary to that rule of Chriſt, <hi>Againſt an Elder receive not an Accuſation under two or Witneſſes,</hi> 1 Tim. 5. 19.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. That in ſome places, where there are two Witneſſes they ſpeak not to the ſame time, and according to the true intent of the Law of God and man, their evidence is but ſingle.</p>
                     <p n="5">
                        <pb n="47" facs="tcp:65071:25"/>
5. That many of theſe Witneſſes, that have given in their Teſtimonies raſhly and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onately, as will be evinced; when I come to the more particular diſquiſition thereof.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. That tho it was not fair according to any judicial procedings; nor according to their intent of coming down from <hi>London</hi> to <hi>Ketterin,</hi> to receive confirmation of any thing from Witneſſes not preſent; yet this has been done.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall now addreſs my ſelf to a particular conſideration, of the matters evidenced at <hi>Kette<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rin</hi> by way of charge.

For better method I ſhall ſet down, what was witneſſed in a different <hi>Italian</hi> Character, and my anſwer in the other.</p>
                     <p>In this paper as to matters of Charge in Faith and Practice, there are ſent divers particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars; but they do not acquaint me, whether they find fault with all, nor what in this and that particular they judge blame-worthy; which is a very incandid way of Charging</p>
                     <p>Notwithſtanding I ſhall take from hence. an occaſion plainly to diſcover my judgment without reſerve. And ſhall not at preſent tarry much to reaſon the matter; but being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaded according to the Laws of Diſputations, will wait to ſee what Tenents will be oppoſed, and their reaſons for ſo doing: Tho, when I think it convenient <hi>now,</hi> I ſhall not forbear to reaſon the matter, and thus I begin.</p>
                     <p>[Charge 1. <hi>That the Elect are actually juſtified from Eternity, witneſſed by Mr.</hi> Bland, <hi>Mr.</hi> Leigh, <hi>Mr.</hi> Chandler, <hi>&amp;c.]</hi>

                        <hi>Anſwer.</hi> Mr. <hi>Leigh</hi>'s Teſtimony <hi>I</hi> teſtify againſt, as being an excommunicate perſon.

And when at <hi>Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi> in diſcourſe he objected to me my timing of Juſtification, <hi>I</hi> anſwer'd, he had not yet heard of me when <hi>I</hi> timed it, which he did not, and could not contradict; ſo that <hi>I</hi> wonder he dare ſay he took it from my mouth in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting. But Mr. <hi>Chandler</hi> herein, as well as in other things, is a moſt affectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Evidence. But this <hi>I</hi> deliver'd at <hi>Kinbolton,</hi> and in other places, or to this effect: That there was an eternal Juſtification of the Elect in God's Foreknowledge, his Decree, and the eternal Compact, and no further. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, if the term Juſtification be oppoſed, <hi>I</hi> ſhall not contend with People about a word.

                     <p>[2. <hi>The Elect are as much beloved of God, when they are in rebellion againſt him, as when they are called.

               <p>THE deſign of this Charge ſeems to me to be, to overturn the Election of Grace, and ſubſtitute a conditional Election in the room thereof;
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:65071:26"/>
ſo much has been writ in divers Ages in defence of that great fundamental Truth, that there is no need of additions from my Pen, I ſhall conclude it therefore with this Aſſertion, <hi>That if Juſtification be an immanent Act of God, as God abſolutely conſidered, it is an Act of Eternity: But if a tranſient Act of God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as Judge, and an Act of his revealed Will, 'tis an Act of Sin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>[The Law doth not prepare for Converſion. The Spirit of God doth not make uſe of the Law for Converſion.]</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I Anſwer:</hi> The Law, or the Covenant of Works, doth not prepare for Converſion. That the Spirit of God doth not make uſe of the Law in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, is an addition of their own</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>[Mr.</hi> Davis <hi>objected in his Sermon,</hi> But the Law is ſaid to convert. <hi>To this he anſwered, That it is the Law of the Goſpel, which is this,</hi> I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, <hi>&amp;c. The Law cannot convert, becauſe the works of the Law are under a curſe to the Soul.]</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To the beſt of my remembrance, I framed my Objection thus: It is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, <hi>Pſal. 19. 7. The Law of the Lord is perfect, converting the Soul.</hi> Anſwer. By this Law is meant the Doctrine of the Goſpel, or the great Law of diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing Grace held forth in the Goſpel, puts forth converting power, which was proved, by comparing this with <hi>Gal. 2. 19. Rom.</hi> 8. 2. together with <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 15, 16, and 18, as alſo with 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 9. laſtly, with <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 27. from all which places 'tis evident, the Goſpel converts a Soul: <hi>Rom. 1. 16. I am not aſhamed of the Goſpel of Chriſt: it is the power of God to ſalvation to every one that believeth.</hi> So 1 Cor. 4. 15. <hi>For in Chriſt Jeſus I have begotten you through the Goſpel.</hi> 'Tis alſo evident from the holy Scriptures, <hi>That as many as are of the works of the Law are under a curſe,</hi> Gal. 3. 10. How then can the works of the Law convert a Soul?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>[The Law giveth an impious ſight of Sin.]</hi>
               </p>
               <p>My judgment is, That Convictions of the Law, in a ſtate of Nature, are impure, becauſe the ſtate is ſo, and the effect thereof in ſuch a ſtate are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure alſo, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 5, 7, 8. ſee more under Head 14.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>[All the Law doth, is to drive perſons farther off from Chriſt, and make ſome go away and hang themſelves.]</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is put with a falſe grain too. This I preached, That the Law convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing and condemning a Man for Sin in a ſtate of Nature, hath a tendency to drive Souls to deſpair, and that is far enough from Chriſt: And ſome, forced with the terrors thereof, have executed themſelves, witneſs <hi>Judas.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>[Mr.</hi> Davis <hi>preached, Believe not others who propheſie Lyes in the Name of the Lord. Whoſoever weareth a rough garment to deceive, and tells them of</hi> John Baptiſt'<hi>s preparing the way, and preaching up his roughneſs, his preparatory works, and that you muſt bring theſe qualifications, they propheſie Lyes in the Name of the Lord. Perſons mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery is their qualification.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I am not concerned how they wreſt matters: But this I affirm, That they that preach up the preparatory works as qualifications that muſt recommend perſons to Chriſt, ſo far they depart from their Commiſſion, and ſo far they propheſie Lyes in the Name of the Lord. And if there be any thing that makes perſons the Subjects of God's free mercy, it is miſery. <hi>The Phyſician is not for the whole, but the ſick.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>

                  <hi>[Such as preach up Preparatory Works, are Legal Preachers; hinder Peoples Comfort, and keep them under Bondage. We ſhould begin with high Confidence, and hold it faſt unto the end.]</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Such as are afore-mentioned, are Legal Preachers; hinder Peoples Comfort, and keep them under Bondage.</p>
               <p>The Goſpel commands Sinners to believe, and to be ſtrong in Faith, <hi>whether they attain to it, or no.</hi> The Goſpel hath no Degrees of Commands: As firſt commanding a more imperfect Faith, mix'd with a great deal of Unbelief; and then a more perfect Faith, and leſs Unbelief. The Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections of our Obedience, muſt not be the Meaſures of Goſpel-Commands. I never ſaid, Sinners muſt arrive to ſuch a degree of Faith, before it can be ſaving: But this I do affirm, That the Goſpel doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire of Sinners, to believe in Hope againſt all Hope. And there are ſeveral Inſtances in the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> of ſuch great Faith at firſt. And the <hi>Word of God</hi> commands us, to <hi>hold the beginning of our confidence ſtedfaſt to the end,</hi> Heb. 3. 6, 14. chap. 10. 19, 22. and likewiſe ver. 35.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>[There is the Redeemer. Ay, ſaith the Soul; but I muſt be humbled more, and pray more. I ſay, you may repent, and be damn'd; for this is ſlighting the Goſpel. Do you know how much you would have, afore you come to Chriſt?]</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I Anſwer, I ſhall not mind their wreſted Sentences: But this I have preach'd, and this I will ſtand by, That Souls that delay their Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the Goſpel-Command, of believing on the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, under pretence, that they are not humbled enough, and qualified enough for Chriſt; do ſlight the Goſpel. I alſo ſay further, That there are many that have had legal Repentance enough, that are now in Hell. It is ſaid, <hi>Judas</hi> repented; and yet he periſhed.</p>
               <p>☞ <hi>[Sinners muſt come to Chriſt immediately, and be united to him in all their Sins and Filth.]</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This, I know, I have preached, as my Judgment; That Sinners muſt come to Chriſt, as Sinners; and not as made Saints firſt. And the Goſpel biddeth them come immediately; <hi>To day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts,</hi> Heb. 1. 3, 7, 8. Nor do I know where they muſt leave their Sins, afore they come to Chriſt: In that moment they are United to Chriſt, is the Change made; they do not continue in a filthy State any longer: Yet I do not ſee how their State is changed, or they can leave their Sins, before an actual Union with Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>[Some hold, There muſt be Preparatory Works: Which is a Stumbling-block.]</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I Anſwer; That ſuch as do preach up Preparatory Works, (as afore-mention'd,) do lay Stumbling-blocks in the way of Sinners.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>[A Perſon may ſincerely deſire after Holineſs, and yet be nothing: Nay, he may deſire Chriſt to reign over him, and yet not be ſavingly convinced.]</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> I do think it is poſſible, a Perſon may have ſincere deſires after that which the New-coin'd Divinity calls the <hi>Leſſer Holineſs,</hi> afore Faith, as Conditional of their Juſtification, and yet be nothing; becauſe they ſeek to be Juſtified by the Works of the Law. And ſo it was with the Jews, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 31, 32. &amp; <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 20, 21. And it is poſſible, they may
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:65071:27"/>
deſire Chriſt to reign over them, to ſubdue many of their Iniquities, to this intent, that for their ſubdued Iniquities they might be Juſtified.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>[When then are you ſavingly convinced? You are ſavingly convinced, when you can believe Chriſt died for you.]</hi>

                  <hi>Robert Page</hi> atteſted as affectionately in this; as when he witneſſed, Mr. <hi>Bear</hi> was one of us, when he is not. But to the Matter in hand. I judge then a Soul ſavingly convinced, when he is ſo convinced of Sin and Miſery, that he ſees nothing but the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt will do: When he is convinced of the Suitableneſs, and abſolute Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of this Righteouſneſs to him; and that nothing ſhort of an Intereſt in it, will ſatisfie his Conſcience. Alſo, When he is convinced of his great Evil, in leaning ſo long on his own Righteouſneſs; and the proneneſs of his Heart to do ſo ſtill. And Laſtly, When he is convinced of an evil Heart of Unbelief.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>[The Spirit convinceth of no Sin but <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelief.]</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sure Mr. <hi>Jerry</hi> was under a great Miſtake: For it was this I inferred from <hi>John</hi> 16. 7, 8, 9, 10. 11. That the firſt Sin the Spirit ſavingly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinceth a Man of, is his own evil Heart of Unbelief; and his Evil, in truſting to his own Righteouſneſs. But ſee how ſtrangely it is wreſted! What will not Envy and Prejudice put a Man upon?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>[For any to look to their Sanctification, was an hindrance to their cloſing with Chriſt.]</hi>
               </p>
               <p>'Tis true, in a good ſence, they have no Holineſs afore they cloſe with Chriſt; and what ſhould they look for that to bring with them, they cannot poſſibly have afore they come.</p>

               <p>The Reader may eaſily perceive, that the tendency of all theſe Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, under this general Head, is to ſupport Two Principles.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>I. That there muſt be antecedent Works, as Conditions of Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Or at leaſt,</item>
                  <item>II. There muſt be antecedent Works, to fit and prepare us for Chriſt.</item>
               </list>
               <p>The Firſt Principle I cannot fall in with, for theſe enſuing Reaſons.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 1. God Juſtifies us freely, as well as he Choſe us freely; and Chriſt died for us freely. God choſe the Elect; and Chriſt died for them, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any regard had to foreſeen Conditions; <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 11. with 13. 15. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 6, 8. So he alſo Juſtifies, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 16. So <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 24. <hi>Being juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied freely by his grace, through the redemption that is in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 2. The Word of the Lord ſays, That God Juſtifies the Elect, not as Saints, nor as reformed Sinners, but as ungodly Sinners, <hi>Rom. 4. 5. But believeth on him that juſtifies the ungodly.</hi> Therefore he does not Juſtifie upon precedent Conditions.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="51" facs="tcp:65071:27"/>
                  <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 3. To make the Works of the Law, to be the Conditions of our Juſtification, is to ſeek to be Juſtified by the Deeds of the Law I which the Word of the Lord expreſsly condemns, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 20, 28. <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 11. &amp; 3. 11.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 4. If the Sinner may be allowed to have the Works of the Law, as Conditions of his Juſtification; then he has ground of boaſting in himſelf: But the Law of Faith, that receives Juſtification freely, as a free Gift, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 16. excludes all manner of boaſting from the Creature, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 27. <hi>Where is Boaſting then? It is excluded. By what Law? Of Works? Nay, but, by the Law of Faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 5. The perfect Law or Promiſe of an infinitely Holy, Righteous God, muſt needs require Perfect Conditions: Therefore, Imperfect Obedience cannot be the Conditions of Juſtification.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 6. Whatſoever is not of Faith, is Sin; and all Works done before Faith, put on the Nature of Sin; and that that is ſinful, cannot be the Conditions of Juſtification.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 7. They that are performing Conditions in a State of Nature, are under a Curſe, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 10. <hi>For as many as are of the works of the Law, are under a curſe.</hi> And how can that that is under a Curſe, be the Cndition of Juſtification?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 8. This Doctrine of Antecedent Conditions of Juſtification, as it is contrary to the Word of God, ſo it is contrary to the Doctrine of the firſt Proteſtant Reformers; and alſo expreſsly contrary to the Tenth, Eleventh, Twelfth and Thirteenth Articles of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> which moſt of the Diſſenting Miniſters in the Kingdom have ſubſcrib'd to.</p>
               <p>Neither can I be for the Second Principle: <hi>Viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That there muſt be antecedent Qualifications, at leaſt, to fit us and prepare us for Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Before I give my Reaſons, I ſhall firſt tell what the Queſtion is not: And then, what it is.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Queſtion is not, Whether an Elect Soul may not often be under the Convictions of the Law, before Grace cometh. For that we all agree in.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Or, Whether God doth moſt commonly lay hold of a Sinner by his Grace, when he is under ſtrong Convictions of Sin by the Law. For this I readily aſſent to.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Or, Whether ſince Actual Juſtification, as it is an Act of God, ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated in the Conſcience, is an Actual Diſcharge there for the ſake of Imputed Righteouſneſs, that it is neceſſary there be, the ſame mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, an Actual Conviction or Arraignment, by the Law, in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, which is called a <hi>Sight of Sin,</hi> to make the Soul ſee its need of the Righteouſneſs of the Lord Jeſus.</p>

               <gap reason="duplicate" extent="1 page">

               <p>
                  <pb n="52" facs="tcp:65071:29"/>
But the Queſtion is,</p>
               <p>Whether legal Convictions do prepare and fit the Soul to receive Chriſt? <hi>i. e.</hi> By enabling the Soul the more, or making the Soul the more willing to receive Grace antecedent to the State of Grace? And this I do deny.</p>
               <p>All the aforeſaid Arguments againſt Conditions of Juſtification, are edg'd againſt ſuch antecedent Qualifications alſo. However I ſhall add a few more Arguments.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 1. The Word of the Lord ſays, That God walks by the ſame rule in Calling, as he did in Election, and the Eternal Compact, 2 <hi>Tim. 1. 9. Who hath ſaved us, and called us with an holy calling; not according to our works, but according to his own purpoſe and grace, which was given us in Chriſt Jeſus, before the world began.</hi> Whence it is convincingly evident, That as he hath choſen the Elect, and promiſed them all Grace in Chriſt, their Common-Head, before the Foundation of the World, without any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard had to their fore-ſeen Qualifications, [not according to their Works] So he alſo ſaveth them with an holy Calling, in time, without the leaſt regard had to their then previous Works: <hi>For it is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth; but of God, that ſheweth mercy, Rom.</hi> 9. 16. See further, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 8.</p>
               <p>

               <p>I am almoſt perſwaded, Mr. <hi>Chandler</hi> never heard it: But my Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is, Faith is a Perſwaſion of the Pardon of Sin, and Acquitment by the Lord Jeſus.

               <p>
                  <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Faith is defined by the ſame word, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 21. The Apoſtle expreſſes his own Faith, and the Faith of the Elect, in the ſame words, <hi>Rom. 8. 38. Gal. 5. 8. 2 Tim.</hi> 1. 12.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>[To believe a Man's Sins are Pardon'd, is Juſtifying Faith.]</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Their racking of Sentences I mind not: But this I do affirm, That Juſtifying Faith, is, to Believe on Chriſt, for the Pardon of Sin, which he has purchaſed; and not a blind Conſent of the Will, to I know not what.</p>
               <p>2. That every Act of True Faith, hath particular Application in it. My Act of Faith, relateth not to Sin in general; but my Sin.</p>
               <p>3. Faith looks to Chriſt for what he hath already done; for a Pardon al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready purchaſad, and an Acquitment already obtained, <hi>Mat. 22. 4. Luk.</hi> 14. 17.</p>
               <p>4. The leaſt degree of True Faith, hath ſome Aſſurance in it; tho' not ſo much as extinguiſheth, nor yet ſo much as keepeth under; but always ſo much as doth oppoſe and diſapprove of unbelieving Doubts and Fears.</p>
               <p>5. Stronger Faith carries ſtronger Aſſurance with it: The more clearly and ſtrongly I rely on the Righteouſneſs and Strength that are in Chriſt, for me; the more firmly I can conclude, I am made Righteous in his
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:65071:30"/>
Righteouſneſs. The Argument is Mr. <hi>Pemble</hi>'s againſt <hi>Bellarmine;</hi> which Mr. <hi>B</hi>—in vain attempts to overthrow.</p>
               <p>6. Laſtly: The Spirit often-times cometh in a ſealing Promiſe, with irreſiſtible Light; aſſuring the Conſcience of a Believer, that his Sins are Pardoned, and he is Juſtified: ſo that during this time of Sealing, all Doubts, Fears and Queſtionings, are ſilenc'd; though when this is paſt, they may revive again: And who dare exclude this, from relating to Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifying Faith?</p>
               <p>Let's have a care of contradicting and blaſpheming the Operations of the Holy Ghoſt, and offending againſt the Generation of the Juſt, who have more or leſs met with ſuch Promiſes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>[Some will put you upon trying your State by ſuch Marks of Sincerity, Love to the Brethren, Univerſal Obedience and Love to God and Chriſt. But this way he denied, and ſaid, Men make Idols of them, and worſhip'd Stones and Stocks: And ſuch as put them on ſuch ways of Tryal, are like</hi> Baal'<hi>s Prieſts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is to no purpoſe for me to fight with their wreſted words; I ſhall only therefore deliver my Judgment plainly, as to Marks and Signs.</p>
               <p n="1">1. I judge there is no Holineſs, or gracious Qualifications preceding Faith.</p>
               <p n="2">2. To ſet up theſe, as the Marks and Signs of our being Juſtified, is,</p>
               <p>1. The greateſt Cheat put upon the Soul in the World. 2. It is the greateſt Affront, put upon the Spirit and Blood of Chriſt: For thereby they thruſt theſe that are Nothing, into the Room and Throne of the Mediator and Comforter; and they that do ſo, are guilty of Spiritual and Mental Idolatry, as if they worſhiped Stocks and Stones.</p>
               <p>As to that of <hi>Baal</hi>'s Prieſts, I remember nothing of: But let the Coin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of this New Goſpel, that preach ſuch Doctrines, look to it, leſt they juſtly deſerve the Name</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>[Some will tell you, You muſt examine your ſelves, whether you be in the Faith, or no: But I ſay, Look for no Marks and Signs, but a riſen Jeſus; ſeek for no other.]</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I affirm, That Faith is a great Evidence; yea, and Self-Evidence too, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 1. The great Evidence of Faith, is the once Crucified, but now Riſen Jeſus: It is Jeſus that died, is riſen again, and is ſet down at the Right-Hand of the Father, and ever liveth to intercede: They that look off of him, to look within, ſeek for a living Chriſt in a dead Frame.</p>
               <p>I never was againſt Self-Examination, performed in the Light of Faith, acting directly toward the Object.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>[At</hi> Willingham <hi>he preached, That Chriſtians muſt not try themſelves by Marks and Signs of Grace: This is, as if a Perſon ſhould ſhut the Doors and Windows of his Houſe, to let in more Light. And produced</hi> Mat. 12. 38, 39. <hi>to reprove this way of Heart-Examination; which (he ſaid) lay with Awe upon his Spirit, and he could not but mention it, (viz.)</hi> An evil and adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Generation ſeeketh after a Sign. <hi>And added, O Generation of Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors; I may ſay, of Preachers, that ſeek after a Sign</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="55" facs="tcp:65071:30"/>
1. This is further my Judgment, That the Scriptural Marks and Signs, which are the inſeparable Effects and Concomitants of Faith, are, one way or other, ſome Evidence of our Juſtification.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That they do alſo, (as Dr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> phraſeth it,) <hi>eek out,</hi> encourage and ſtrengthen our Faith, in a certain way and meaſure.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That Souls are more prone to look to them, than to Chriſt, and his Grace, the Object of Faith; and that is very dangerous. Spiritual Senſe and Enjoyments, though given us, is ſomething within us: But Faith, like the Merchant's Ship, fetcheth its Goods from far, even from Jeſus, at the Right-Hand of the Father. We are apter to tabernacle within, than to go out of Self for a Supply continually; which is ſwim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming againſt Wind and Tide, going contrary to Sence and Humane Wiſdom; it is that that Fleſh and Blood knoweth not.</p>
               <p>Laſtly: Since Marks and Signs ſhine only in the Light of Faith; and Faith ſhineth not, but when it looketh directly to its Object, the Grace that is in Chriſt Jeſus; then ſo to Examine our Faith, when we ceaſe to Act Faith, is as if One ſhould put out a Candle, to ſee whether it burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth or not; or to ſhut cloſe the Doors and Windows, to ſee whether the Room be light. This I have preached at <hi>Willingham,</hi> or to this effect; though the Witneſſes have made a woful Blunder about it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>[Sanctification is no Evidence of Juſtification.]</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Faith, and its Effects, have a great ſhare in Goſpel-Holineſs; and ſure they are Signs of Juſtification? But ſuch Holineſs as they plead for, is no Holineſs, and therefore no Evidence of Juſtification.</p>

            <div type="subpart">
               <head>Animadverſions on the foregoing Head.</head>
               <p>IT is Remarkable, Accuſations under this Head, tend to ſupport theſe Two following Principles. (1.) That Divine Illumination is not of the Eſſence of Saving-Faith. (2.) To over-turn the Faith of Aſſurance, or to ſet up one that's not known in the Scripture; and that can be of no uſe to Believers.</p>
               <p>But I ſhall prove that Divine Illumination is of the Eſſence of Saving-Faith. For,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>1ſt.</hi> None can believe on what they know not: None can ſee a need of Chriſt, nor fly unto him, but they whoſe Eyes have been opened by the Spirit, to ſee the Beauty, Excellency and Neceſſity of Chriſt Jeſus: Therefore Faith is not a blind Conſent to the Will only.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>2dly.</hi> As the Spirit does work in this Faith, he is called the <hi>Spirit of Wiſdom and Revelation, in the knowledge of him that is Christ,</hi> Eph. 1. 17. His Office is, to <hi>open and enlighten the Eyes of the Underſtanding,</hi> ver. 18. As alſo, <hi>to take the things of Chriſt, and ſhew unto the Soul,</hi> Joh. 16. 14. And, to <hi>make known unto Believers the Myſtery of his Will,</hi> Eph. 1. 9. <hi>Having made known unto us the myſtery of his will, according to his good pleaſure, which he hath purchaſed to himſelf.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>3dly.</hi> Faith it ſelf is called, a <hi>Revelation of Chriſt in the Soul,</hi> Gal. 1. 15, 16.
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:65071:31"/>
                  <hi>But when it pleaſed God to ſeparate me from my mother's womb, and called me by his Grace,</hi> ver. 16. To <hi>reveal his Son in me,</hi> is alſo called, the <hi>Aſſurance of Underſtanding,</hi> Col. 2. 2. <hi>That their hearts may be comforted, being knit toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in love, and unto all riches of the full aſſurance of underſtanding, to the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment of the myſtery of God, and of the Father, and of Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I might add more Reaſons, but I judge theſe ſufficient. But obſerve, I do not make Faith to be only a Divine, Natural Illumination, or Underſtanding; but alſo an Act of the Will divinely perſwaded, accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of, and leaning on Chriſt. As to the Second thing, I muſt confeſs, the new coin'd <hi>Faith of Aſſurance,</hi> I do not underſtand; to wie, That it is, when a Chriſtian can find ſuch and ſuch Marks in himſelf and theſe in ſincerity; then he may be aſſured of his Salvation: and this without any mention made of looking to Chriſt, or leaning on him, in the very Act of Aſſurance.</p>
               <p>But I find no Foot ſteps of ſuch a Faith in the Scripture: Theſe are my <hi>Arguments</hi> againſt it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 1. The Object of Saving-Faith, is Chriſt, once Crucified, now at the Father's Right-Hand: But this ſort of Faith of Aſſurance, ſets up a Chriſt within, a <hi>Quaker</hi>'s Chriſt, as the Object of Faith.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 2. If it be granted, that this Faith of Aſſurance, takes its Grounds and Denomination from as Reflect Act of Faith; yet a Reflect Act of Faith, is but a <hi>Repercuſſion</hi> upon the Conſcience of that Light that ſhines in a direct Act of Faith: ſo that there can be no true Marks and Signs without Faith in that moment exercis'd: <hi>He that doth truth, cometh to the light, that his deeds may be made manifeſt that they are wrought of God,</hi> Joh. 3. 21. So then, they that bid People try their Faith, by looking within, and not bidding them at that time look to Chriſt, and that firſt; put them, in my Judgment, upon an impoſſible Teſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 3. As there can be no real Marks and Signs, without Faith ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercis'd upon the Object; ſo, to put People upon examining the Since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of their ſuppoſed Marks and Signs, is yet to make the Matter ten times more difficult and perplexing to the Soul. Goſpel-Sincerity, I find in Scripture to be this, <hi>viz.</hi> To mix nothing with Chriſt, and his Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, in our Juſtification <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> and to have right Principles, Means, Aims, and Ends, in carrying of Sanctification. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 4, 5. comp together.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 4. They that would examine their Faith, whether it be ſincere, by Marks and Signs, without Faith in the Exerciſe, muſt have a Second Mark to know the Firſt, a Third to prove the Second, and a Fourth to prove the Third; and ſo, <hi>ad infinitum.</hi> Hence it is that poor Souls are quite be, wilder'd, to bring the Matter to a determinate iſſue; ſo that deſpairing of making their Calling and Election ſure, they content themſelves with lazy, faint and languid Hopes, which have no good bottom; or elſe, what is worſt of all, they embrace a Cloud inſtead of this Aſſurance. I ſhall humbly offer my Judgment of Faith of Aſſurance, as I find it in Scripture.</p>

1. I do not deny, but that when we ſenſibly feel our inward Grace ſhining in the Light of Faith, we may from thence, together with the Evidence of Faith, inferr the Certainty of our Believing; as when we ſenſibly perceive our Love to Chriſt flowing from our Faith in him, we may thence conclude we have the Faith of God's Elect; and ſo of other Graces. But perhaps this is but ſeldom the frame of a Believer's Spirit; and yet he ought, when he walks in the dark, to hold faſt his Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence: Therefore there muſt needs be that that is, true Aſſurance, though not ſo high and ſo ſenſible as this. And,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>1ſt.</hi> I find in Scripture, it is a ſtrong and conſtant reliance upon the Ability and Faithfulneſs of Chriſt, as to the Grace promiſed: This you have inſtanced in <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Faith, <hi>Rom. 4. 20, 21. He ſtagger'd not at the promiſes of God, through unbelief; but was ſtrong in faith, giving glory to God.</hi> And in <hi>ver. 21. And was fully perſwaded, that what he had promiſed, he was alſo able to perform.</hi> So alſo inſtanced in the Faith of <hi>Sarah,</hi> Heb. 11. 11. <hi>Through faith alſo Sarah her ſelf received ſtrength to conceive ſeed, and was deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered of a child when ſhe was paſt age; becauſe ſhe judged him faithful that had promiſed.</hi> So therefore, in both theſe Inſtances, you may ſee that this their Aſſurance was grounded upon the Ability and Faithfulneſs of the Promiſer: It is the ſame with that called the <hi>Plerophery</hi> of Faith, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 22. And that is founded upon, <hi>(1ſt.)</hi> The Means of Admittance to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, by the Blood of Jeſus, <hi>ver. 19. (2dly.)</hi> The Way of Admittance to the Father, <hi>viz.</hi> The <hi>new and living way, conſecrated through the vail; that is to ſay, the fleſh of Jeſus,</hi> ver. 21. Who is our Common Head and Repreſentative, through whom we are admitted to the Father, <hi>viz. ſuch an High-prieſt over the houſe of God,</hi> ver. 21. So that I conclude, the more ſtrongly, purely, unmixtly, and frequently we behold and lean upon Chriſt; the more Light cometh in from the Object, to evidence our Faith it ſelf. The more an Infant exerciſeth his Legs, the more he knoweth he hath them, and alſo knows their Uſefulneſs, and the more veturous he is of walking on them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I find this Faith of Aſſurance, called <gap reason="foreign">

               <p n="3">3.

<pb n="58" facs="tcp:65071:32"/>
he is Pardoned and Juſtified, and conſequently an Elect Veſſel, though it laſts but for a little ſeaſon</p>
               <p>In theſe ſorts of Aſſurance, I find none of them built upon our inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Qualifications, but on <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> the <hi>Corner-ſtone;</hi> and all Three of them <hi>caſt anchor within the vail, upon the great fore-runner that is enter'd for us, even Jeſus, made an High-Prieſt for ever, after the order of Melchizedeck.</hi>

Though <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Law be there intended, yet the Covenant of Works, made with the Elect in the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> is not thereby excluded; nay, I think, chiefly deſigned: For to me it's plain, that the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> was but a manifeſtative Copy of the Covenant of Works made with <hi>Adam.</hi> I judge this is paſt Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, That the Covenant of Works could never have ſecur'd the Elect in Eternal Happineſs: This is manifeſt from God's Word, and from the Event; for it did not ſecure their ſtanding One day. This Honour therefore is to be given to the Covenant of Redemption, of which the Lord the Redeemer is the Surety. None but a rank <hi>Arminian</hi> will deny this; therefore I wonder to what purpoſe this is ſent as a Charge.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>[That Believers under the Law, had their Life from their Doings; and they had no longer Life, than when they were crying, and weeping, and groaning. Witneſſed by Mr.</hi> Robert Page; <hi>who entring into a Conference with Mr.</hi> Davis <hi>about it, objected</hi> Iſai. 53. 5. He was wounded, <hi>&amp;c. and therefore the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet believed on Chriſt. To which Mr.</hi> Davis <hi>replied,</hi> The Prophet did not underſtand what he ſaid.]</p>
               <p>This I have anſwer'd pretty largely in the <hi>Anſwer</hi> to the <hi>Libel,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſhall not inſiſt much on it now: Only this I ſhall obſerve, That the whole current of the Epiſtles written by the Apoſtles, is to ſhew an extraordinary Difference between the Two Adminiſtrations. And this is made the main thing, That <hi>now the Juſt live by Faith.</hi> Not that this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes the Faith of the Old-Teſtament-Saints, but only makes that of the New-Teſtament-Saints far to exceed it. The Inſtances of <hi>David,</hi> and others of the Prophets, overturns not that general Rule, allowed in the former Diſpenſation, they were rare, ſingular and extraordinary; beſides, the Holy Ghoſt ſaith expreſly, what they ſaid was but Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical of what ſhould be in Goſpel-Days, <hi>For they did not miniſter unto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:65071:32"/>
but unto us the things which are now reported unto us, by them that Preach the Goſpel,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 12. And this was it which I ſaid, in Anſwer to Mr. <hi>Robert Page,.</hi> (how invidiouſly ſoever he curtails it,) when he affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, that the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> underſtood the Meaning and Goſpel of his own Prophecy, as well as the Apoſtle <hi>Paul;</hi> from which aforementi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned Scripture, I obſerved, that the Grace and Salvation Propheſied of by them in its Clearneſs and Diſpenſation belonged to the New-Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment-Saints, for it is ſaid, <hi>(who Propheſy'd of the Grace that ſhould come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toyou.)</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. It is Evident from the Words, that in their Prophecies they did not miniſter to themſelves at all—thus, <hi>not unto themſelves, but unto us they did miniſter the things, which are reported unto you, by them that Preach the Goſpel unto you.</hi> But if they had ſeen into it, as clear as New-Teſtament-Saints, they would certainly have miniſtered unto themſelves; which, the Holy Ghoſt ſaith, they did not doe.</p>
               <p>3. It is manifeſt from that Place, that they ſearched and enquired di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently, what was the meaning of their own Prophecies; for they not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſearched what they Propheſied, but after what manner the things Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſied ſhould be accompliſh'd, and when? <hi>ver. 11. Searching what or what manner of time (i. e.</hi> what Manner of Diſpenſation it ſhould be.) <hi>The Spirit of Christ, which was in them, did ſignifie,</hi> when it teſtified be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hand, the Sufferings of <hi>Chriſt, and the Glory that ſhould follow.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What need all this diligent ſearch and enquiry into theſe Matters, and yet, after all, could not adminiſter them unto themſelves; if the Spirit had revealed unto them the meaning of their own Prophecies, as clearly as he did to the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> afterwards? To this <hi>Robert Page</hi> made no Anſwer, but that that Place of Scripture, muſt needs have another Meaning; but what that other Meaning is, he hath not told me to this Day.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>[Believers under the Law, had no real Sight of Chriſt.]</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Chandler</hi> here alſo witneſſeth very corruptly: For what I ſaid, was this, which is ready to be atteſted by ſeveral, <hi>That Believers under the Law, had no clear Sight of Chriſt:</hi> for it was Chriſt manifeſted in the Promiſe, and not in the Fleſh, that they had immediately to Eye: This is ſo clearly to be prov'd by many Teſtimonies of Holy Writ, beſides that in 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 10, 11, 12. that I need not add any more, for I think it will not be denyed.</p>
               <p>This I obſerve of Mr. <hi>Chandler</hi>'s Teſtimony, that he ſtill offereth to corroborate it with Mr. <hi>Acok</hi> as his faithful Second; whereas there were divers others always preſent as well as he, and yet ſcarcely any mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, but he alone, becauſe he is filled with as much prejudice as himſelf</p>

               <head>Animadverſions on the foregoing Head.</head>
               <p>THE Deſign of the Charges under this Head, ſeem very probably to me to inſinuate this: That there is no Difference between Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers now, and Believers under the Law; and therefore. Believers then being under a Conditional Covenant of Grace, (as is alledged) they
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:65071:33"/>
are ſo ſtill, even now in Goſpel Days: But the Vanity of this Argument appears, if we do but well weigh the Scope, Argument and Deſign of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the Writings of the Apoſtles, both of <hi>Paul</hi> and others, which was to ſhew an eminent difference between the Two Diſpenſations; this the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle <hi>Paul</hi> doth on ſet purpoſe, through the whole Thread of his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Romans.</hi> The like is done in that of the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Now grant, that to be a Conditional Covenant of Grace, yet now ſaith the Word of the Lord, we are under another Diſpenſation, far exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that, and this, in a greater preheminence, above the other, in that it is free in its Diſpenſation: The former Covenant ſaid, <hi>Do this,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. But the Covenant of Grace, the Rightouſneſs of Faith, ſaith on this wiſe, <hi>Aſcend not into Heaven to bring Chriſt from Above, deſcend not into the Deep, to bring Christ up;</hi> that is, perform no Conditions for Chriſt: <hi>but what,</hi> ſaith it, <hi>the Word is nigh thee, even in thy Word, and in thy Heart; that is,</hi> the Word of Faith, and it <hi>is of Faith that it might be of Grace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>2dly.</hi> The Order of the Firſt Covenant was quite different from this: The Firſt Covenant ran in this ſtrain, <hi>Exod. 19. 5. Now therefore, if ye will obey my Voice indeed, and keep my Commandments, then ye ſhall be a peculiar People unto me above all People,</hi> &amp;c. Whence obſerve, 1ſt. here is Doing and Obeying, before there is a Right and Title to any Bleſſing: The Order of the Second Covenant ran quite otherwiſe, as you may ſee <hi>Jerem. 3. 35. Hebr.</hi> 8. 13. Where you have <hi>1ſt.</hi> The Cauſe, the free pardon of Sin: <hi>2dly,</hi> The Effects; <hi>I will put my Laws in their Hearts, and write them in their Minds,</hi> v. 10; and the Cauſe muſt always precede the Effects: Obſerve in the Firſt Covenant, Obedience is mentioned as the Condition of the Bleſſing. <hi>3dly,</hi> This new Covenant is ſaid to be eſtabliſhed upon better Promiſes, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 8. 6. The Promiſes of the Firſt Covenant being chiefly Temporal and all Conditional; but the Promiſes of the Second being Eternal, and alſo Abſolute and Free. <hi>4thly,</hi> The Firſt Covenant was faulty. Not that there was any Fault in the Holy Covenant, but in them that were under it: For it is ſaid expreſsly, <hi>Heb. 8. 8. For finding fault with them,</hi> &amp;c. And that is, becauſe they could not perform the Conditions of it; therefore the Fault of the Covenant was in reſpect of them that were under it, becauſe they could not come up to the Terms of it. But this Fault is fully amended in the Scond, in that the Conditions are fully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by the Mediator thereof; and therefore the Bleſſings thereof are perfectly Free and Unconditional to them that are under it: ſo that no fault can be found with the Covenant, for requiring Conditions not to be performed; for they are already performed by the moſt excellent My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry of the Mediator of this Second Covenant Nor can there be any fault found with them that are under it; for they can plead the Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance already given in by their Surety and Repreſentative: This is the main Scope of the Apoſtle's Argumentation, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. ver. 6, <hi>ad finem.</hi> So that I conclude, If the Firſt Covenant were a Conditional Covenant of
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:65071:33"/>
Grace; yet it is evident, that the Second has the Preheminence over it, in that it is Free; yea, Abſolutely Free to us, without Condition.</p>
               <p>I might add many Scriptural Reaſons more, to prove the Freedom and Unconditionality of this New-Covenant; but that would be contrary to my deſigned brevity, therefore let theſe ſuffice for the preſent.</p>
               <p>I ſhall now return to the next Head of Charges.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>[In Prayer, he ſaid, Lord, we ſtand before thee without Sin! And in his Sermon, he objected, Some ſay we are againſt Praying againſt Pardon of Sin: to which he anſwered, altho' we are Pardoned; yet it is our duty to pray for Pardon, for the Honour of the Father and of the Son.]</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> There is too much Sin cleaves to our Perſons and Performances, and we ought to acknowledge it; but Believers in the Righteouſneſs of another, are ſo accounted; which was meant, if not added. Though there be Spots enough upon us, and upon our beſt Performances; yet there is no ſpot in that Compleat and God-like Righteouſneſs, which is imputed to us. The Expreſſion is Scriptural; <hi>Rev. 14. 5. For they are without fault before the Throne of God.</hi> Cant. 4. 7. <hi>Thou art all fair, my Love, there is no ſpot in thee.</hi> Why ſhould the Expreſſion then be offenſive to any, except to ſuch who are enemies to the Righteouſneſs of God which is by Faith.</p>
               <p>'Tis true our Juſtification is true at our firſt Believing; this truth is only ſit for <hi>Bellarmine</hi> to deny and they that are like him; therefore when we pray for the Pardon of Sin, we pray for the greater Application of it to our Conſciences, and the continuance thereof; this God requireth of us. And certainly to obey him is to Honour him. 'Pray in this Charge where is the Crime?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>[Lord thou lookeſt upon thy People even when they are ſinning againſt thee, and ſayeſt:</hi> Thou art all fair, my Love, there is no ſpot in thee.]</p>
               <p>Theſe Poſitions are undeniably true:</p>
               <p n="1">1. That the beſt of Believers do ſin, and the ſin of Unbelief mixeth with their beſt Performances, and that I take to be a very great Evil.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That God looketh upon them and dealeth with them always in the compleat Righteouſneſs of his Son, even then alſo when their Imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons mingle with their beſt Holineſs: Elſe what would become of the Beſt?</p>
               <p n="3">3. As this Everlaſting Righteouſneſs is unchangeable, ſo is God's Act of Imputation, <hi>for with him there is no variableneſs, nor ſhadow of turning, from whom this Good and perfect Gift cometh;</hi> Jam. 1. 17. <hi>Jeſus Chriſt that's make of God unto the Believer Wiſdom, and Righteouſneſs, and Sanctification, and Redemption;</hi> 1 Cor. 1. 30. <hi>is the ſame yeſterday, to day and for ever;</hi> Heb. 13. 8. <hi>Who is an Advocate with the Father for us always, even when we ſin:</hi> and pleading his Propitiatory Sacrifice unchangably on our behalf. 1 <hi>John</hi> 1. 2. Compared with <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 24. Tho' we vary and change in our Frames and in the Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of Grace; yet it is well for us, he never changeth: nor the Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his Son: <hi>He is God, and changeth not, therefore,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Mal.</hi> 3. 6.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="62" facs="tcp:65071:34"/>
                  <hi>[There muſt be no more Conſcience of ſin in Believers.]</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Such is the Nature of their Sacrifice, that it ought to be ſo; this Expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on alſo is Scriptural; <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 2. they that cavil at me herein, cavil at the words of the Holy Ghoſt; pray let them undertake to anſwer him for it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>[You would mourn: You would weep. Chriſt hath mourned, Chriſt hath wept, and you have nothing to do but accept his Grace: the Righteouſneſs by which you and I muſt be juſtified, is Chriſt's fulfilling</hi> Adam's <hi>Covenant, and Mount</hi> Sinai's <hi>Covenant, and the Covenant of Grace.]</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I do not remember <hi>verbatim</hi> what hath been expreſſed ſo long ſince, malice it ſelf muſt have a better memory than I to do it; but I will plainly relate my Judgment in the matter.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That the Lord Jeſus Chriſt is according to the Scriptures, the End or Conſummation of the Law, for Righteouſneſs to every one that believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth: <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 14. And he did (as it became him) to fulfill all Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs as their Repreſentative. <hi>2ly.</hi> This offered Righteouſneſs muſt be moſt freely accepted as a free Gift; <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 16. We muſt bring no Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney nor Price in our hands to purchaſe it; <hi>Iſa. 55. 1. 3ly.</hi> Sinners are prone to mourn and weep by way of ſatisfaction to Juſtice; but what e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver in that nature was Penal and Satisfactory to Juſtice, Chriſt dath done and ſuffered; <hi>Iſa. 53. 3, 4. Heb.</hi> 5. 7.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>[When you are diſcouraged with Unbelief in Duty, if you can believe that Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus is there, ſtrongly believing in Heaven for you, this raiſeth your Faith: If you ſee Chriſt loveth for you, this draweth forth your love.]</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt obſerve this differently Phraſed in the Libell, ſo that it ſeems, Mr. <hi>King</hi> took the ſame ſentence from my mouth divers ways, backward and forward, even as his fancy pleaſed to chime it. The ſame obſervations I have made concerning divers of theſe Accuſations compared with them in the Libell.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This I affirm that this Report was heard of early by us, ſo that I and others that heard me did recollect what I delivered, and we found upon ſuch Recollection that my words were wreſted and miſconſtrued, but that I expreſſed my ſelf to this Effect.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>1mo.</hi> That Chriſt as our Repreſentative, fulfilled all Righteouſneſs, as is aforementioned: That Chriſt believed, and believed as our Repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive: Dr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> undeniably proves in his Triumph of Faith.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>2ly.</hi> That the Graces of the Spirit he perfectly exerciſed as man, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth within the Compaſs of our Imputed Righteouſneſs; that all the Righteouſneſs he fulfilld on Earth, he carried with him to Heaven, when he entred once for all, not without Blood, where he eternally pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenteth them to the Father as the matter of our Juſtification; and they are the Pleas he uſeth in his Interceſſion: the Faith and Love and other Graces he exerciſed when on Earth, are now in Heaven where he is.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>3ly.</hi> Believers may take Comfort by veiwing through Faith, not only their Perſons but Performances covered in his Righteouſneſs, and ſee all their Guilt done away in his Blood; ſee their Imperfect Obedience cover'd with his perfect Obedience. This is the Summ of what was delivered, and this I will ſtand by.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="63" facs="tcp:65071:34"/>
                  <hi>[To fear Sin is the way to increaſe it.]</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Poſition I laid down was this, That Unbelieving Fears of Sin, diſtruſting the Power of Chriſt to keep us; is an inlett into ſin; 1 <hi>Job. 4. 18. He that feareth, is not made perfect in Love;</hi> ſo divers other places which I need not inſiſt upon now.</p>

               <head>Animadverſions on the foregoing Head.</head>
               <p>I Cannot but judge that the Particular Accuſations under the foregoing Head, do infer a pernicious deſign againſt the imputed Righteouſneſs of the Son of God, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1. That this Righteouſneſs taketh not in the Active as well as the Paſſive Obedience of Chriſt, which is a Principle which hath been lately minted in Oppoſition to the Current of Orthodox Writers; to the various Confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Faith of the Proteſtants ſince the Reformation; and to the Word of God which hath been already proved in part; Therefore I ſhall only add this following Argument: 1. The Law of God muſt be either ſatisfied or defeated in its intents; and to defeat the intent of ſuch a Holy, Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, Juſt Law, is <hi>Antinomianiſm</hi> with a Witneſs; which puteth a great Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front upon the Law-giver. <hi>2ly.</hi> The Primary intent of God's Law is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Obedience, and without perfect Obedience the Law of God cannot be ſatisfied. <hi>3ly.</hi> Unleſs the Law can be ſatisfied, there is no man living can be juſtified, according to the Tenour of it; and unleſs a ſinner is juſtified, he cannot be ſaved. <hi>4ly.</hi> There is no ſinner can plead ſatisfaction made unto it, in his own proper Perſon; therefore he muſt plead the ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on given by his Surety and Repreſentative in his ſtead, who fully ſatisfied as well the demands of it, as the Penalty; therefore through Faith we eſtabliſh the Law, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 31. and give it the higheſt Honour, by offering to the Law-giver the perfect and God-like Obedience of his Son thereunto.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>2dly.</hi> This laſt Head ſeemeth to have a bad intent, to eclipſe God's Act of Imputation, by which this Righteouſneſs is ſo made over to us for our higheſt Benefit and Advantages, as if we our ſelves had wrought it out. All this reſulteth to Believers, by virtue of Union to the Perſon of Chriſt; and accepting the Union of Three Perſons in One God, and of Two Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in One Perſon. This Union is moſt unexpreſſibly great: bating thoſe Two fore-mentioned Unions, we may ſpeak as high of it, and conceive as high of it as poſſible. By virtue of the Firſt Union, God the Second Perſon is Equal with the Father; and ſo the Third Co-equal with the Two former. By virtue of the Second Union, the Man, Chriſt Jeſus, becometh the Redeemer, the Mediator, the Saviour, Head over all, Prince of Life, Lord of Glory: But it is Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy to attribute any of this to any Believer, by Virtue of a Third Union: it is Blaſphemy to ſay, We are Godded with God, Chriſted with Chriſt, or that we become Saviours and Redeemers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Yet how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, this 3d. Union conferreth great Titles and Privileges upon Believers, according to the Scriptures: As nothing can be ſpoken too high of the

               <p>I cannot but from hence conclude, how vain it is for Men to pretend, with the Line of Reaſon, to ſound this imputed Righteouſneſs, or to judge how far it reacheth, and how far not; ſuch full-blown Diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries thereof, are reſerved for the Glory of the Latter-Day, or rather, for Heaven it ſelf: In the mean while, it is ſafer for us, to keep cloſe to Scriptural Expreſſions, and believe, and admire what we cannot com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend. I wonder therefore, that Saucy Earth-worms dare caſt this imputed Righteouſneſsinto the Fire of their own Fancies, that thence it may come out a Golden Calf, for them to Dance about; or caſt it into the Mold of their own carnal Reaſon, that from thence they may lift up a dead

Image for themſelves to fall down before: <hi>But vain Man would be wiſe, tho Man be born like a wild Aſſes Colt.</hi> Job 11. 12. Yet <hi>this their Wiſdom is their Folly,</hi> being Enmity againſt God, and the way of Salvation by Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Thus <hi>I</hi> have briefly vindicated the Righteouſneſs of God, which is by Faith; now <hi>I</hi> paſs on to the remaining Fragments of Accuſations.</p>
               <p>There are five times of Chriſt's, eſpecial Interceſſion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Chriſt ſaith I cannot ſo heartily pray for my People, when they ſneak from their Profeſſion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> To this purpoſe <hi>I</hi> Preached, That tho Chriſt's Interceſſion be Unchangeable in it ſelf, yet eventually as to us, there are ſpecial Times of Interceſſion; As for inſtance, Chriſt interceedeth for his Elect afore call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, yet it is eventually; an eſpecial time when they are Called. Again he interceedeth for his Children, when under <hi>Babyloniſh</hi> Captivity; yea, he is repreſented in the Scripture eſpecially interceeding when they are coming out of their Captivity, ſee <hi>Zech.</hi> 1. 12, 12. compar'd with verſ. 16, 17. That <hi>Babyloniſh</hi> Captivity, Deliverance and Interceſſion, were but Typical; a greater Man than many now alive, to wit, Mr. <hi>Bridge</hi> of <hi>Yarmouth,</hi> was of the ſame Judgment.</p>
               <p>What was ſaid, as to Chriſt's interceeding for Believers, when ſneaking from their Profeſſion, was to this effect; That Chriſt did not interceed for his own Children, that they might be kept from particular Apoſtacy; for if he had, they ſhould never have fallen thereinto, nor doth he own them unto his Father in relation to their Act of their Apoſtacy; tho he doth as to their State; This is plain to me from <hi>Mat.</hi> 10. 33. As alſo from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of <hi>Peter,</hi> who tho the Lord Jeſus pray'd for him, that his Faith fail'd him not, yet it is not recorded, that he pray'd for him that he ſhould not deny his Maſter; nor did the Lord own him then before his Father, as do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing well in that Act of denying him, confirming it with Curſing and Swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <q>Chriſt and Believers are one in Interceſſion.</q>
               <p>That that I ſaid was this, (as many are ready to atteſt) that we are one with him, who is our Interceſſor; and that I judge is no Error. I abhor putting any into Co-partnerſhip with the Lord Jeſus, as much as others.</p>
               <q>Believers that take comfort in Promiſes, miſtake the way; but we muſt fly to Chriſt.</q>
               <p>They that take Comfort out of the Letter of the Promiſe, without meeting Chriſt in it by Faith, may be miſtaken; for it is Chriſt in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, maketh the Promiſe precious; and the Promiſe without Chriſt is but a dead and inſignificant Promiſe. And if to bid Perſons fly to Chriſt, and not to reſt on any Promiſe ſhort of Chriſt, be to be vile, I'll be more vile ſtill.</p>
               <q>Whatever is Supernatural, is ſaving Grace.</q>
               <p>'Twas thus expreſt in Diſcourſe: All ſaving Grace is Supernatual, as was teſtified to their Faces then, tho they had the Confidence to wreſt the words firſt, and then to Charge them on me.</p>
               <q>The offers of Grace muſt be made to none but the Elect.</q>
               <p>I remember very well this I ſaid to Mr. <hi>Chandler</hi> in private Dicourſe, that God deſigneth his offer'd Grace only to the Elect: This, I think, none but a Free-willer will deny.</p>

               <head>ANIMADVERSIONS.</head>
               <p>THE deſign of this Charge, if I am not miſtaken, may be to Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance the New-minted Principle, that others might be Saved be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the Elect. Again this Principle, I ſhall offer a few Reaſons, and ſo conclude my Defence as to Matter, or Doctrin.</p>
               <p n="1">1. This ſort of Doctrin fixeth two ſorts of Eternal Decrees upon the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly God, both reſpective and irreſpective, which is more abſurd than the <hi>Arminian</hi> Tenent; for it conſtituteth a two-fold Will in God, in reſpect of thoſe that are to beSaved; to wit, that his Eternal Will was to ſave ſome ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely, and others upon Conditions; than which there cannot be a greater Injury offer'd to his holy, perfect and intire Will, which cannot be reſiſted.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It rendreth the Death of Chriſt ineffectual to thoſe to whom they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Salvation, that are out of this Roul of Election, making the Purchaſe of Chriſt's Blood, to hang upon their weak, ſickle, and uncertain Will, which is abominable: For it would make Chriſt die in vain for ſome.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If any be Called and Saved by any other Grace, beſides the Grace of Election, it muſt needs be by Free-will, univerſal Grace, and that the Scripture knoweth nothing of.</p>
               <p n="4">4. More and greater Abſurdities will follow upon this Opinion, than upon the Free will Point. I ſhall conclude what I have to alledge at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, with that Paſſage in the <hi>Aſſembly</hi> and <hi>Savoy</hi> Confeſſion: <hi>Neither are any other Redeem'd by Chriſt, or effectually Call'd, Juſtify'd, Adopted, Sanctify'd and Saved, but the Elect only.</hi> Which I do believe is the Truth as it is in Jeſus.</p>
               <p>I ſhall now go on to Anſwer thoſe Accuſations, that have an Aſpect up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on matters of practice; and herein it is not neceſſary to uſe the former Methods to ſet my Anſwers down in the oppoſite Colume, but it may ſuffice after the particular Charge laid down to Anſwer underneath in Order ſucceſſively.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Accuſation</hi> 1. Mr. <hi>Davis</hi> and his Preachers, ſent from the Church at Rothwell, ſet up Meetings in very many Countries, to the compaſs of about foreſcore Miles: viz. <hi>At</hi> Willingham, Cambridge, Bedford, Needing worth, Northampton, Kemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, Wellingborough, Oundle, Kimbolton, Cayſoe, Kettering, Thorp-waterfield, Chatreſſe, Aireth, Creaton Wormditch, Cayſoe-brook, Woolaſton, Olny, Lutterworth, <hi>the</hi> Fenns, Codgbrook, Old weſton, Broughton, Rusden, Brigſtock, Cockingworth, <hi>Great</hi> Oakly, Geddington. <hi>Some of theſe Towns I do not know.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> I muſt now again, as I did before the Miniſters in <hi>London,</hi> divide our Meetings into three ſorts.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Occaſional Meetings, that is, when we Preach in viſiting the Members of the Church up and down, which is part of my Paſtoral Office, and Care over them. Thus did the Apoſtle <hi>Paul, Acts</hi> 20. 20. and commends the ſame Practice to the Elders of the Church at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> verſs. 28. Or,</p>
               <p n="2">2. When we Preach, being requeſted by other Godly Perſons; thus <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> went at the Requeſt of <hi>Cornelius, Acts</hi> 10. Thus they ſcattered by the Perſecution, Preached the Goſpel up and down, <hi>Acts 11. 19, 20, 21. Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabas</hi> was alſo ſent by the Church as far as <hi>Antioch</hi> to viſit the Converts and Preach to them, Verſ. 22, 23. Or,</p>
               <p n="3">3. When we carry the Goſpel into dark Groves and Places, out of meer
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:65071:37"/>
bowels of Pity and Compaſſion to poor Souls, which we have a preſident for in the bleſſed Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> who ſaith, <hi>Rom. 1. 14. I am a Debtor both to the Greeks and to the Barbarians, both to the wiſe and unwiſe.</hi> So are we.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If theſe ſorts of Meetings be intended by the Charge principally<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> then, I confeſs, half the Towns are not named, that I and the Brethren have Preached in; and I wonder why <hi>London</hi> is not put in as well as the reſt; and why are not theſe following things charged among our Crimes?</p>
               <p n="1">1. That in all theſe places there are Members yet belonging to the Church at <hi>Rothwell,</hi> until they can conveniently multiply into more Churches; that we in Conſcience of Duty to our Lord Jeſus, are bound to watch over and viſit them, exhort and feed them. Whatever Men do, I believe the Great Shepherd at his appearing, will never blame us for doing too much of this nature; we are conſcious of our ſelves, that we come far ſhort of our Duty herein inſtead of exceeding our Bounds.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Let this be our Crime alſo, that Souls have been begotten to a lively Hope through the Goſpel, intheſe fore-mention'd Places, and many more, and wicked prophane Perſons have become lively Saints; however many may call this Converſion, Perverſion; for which Blaſphemy caſt upon the Opperations of the Spirit, they are like to Anſwer for in the Day of Chriſt, unleſs the Blood of the Lamb doth blot it out. Pardon this fooliſh Conſi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dence of Boaſting; we are compelld thereunto in defence to our Faith and Practice.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That we Obey the Lord Jeſus to go and Teach all Nations, to offer his Grace to Sinners as far as we are able. But we Preach the Word, being inſtant in Seaſon and out of Seaſon, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 2. Is it then a matter of Blame, with Diſſenting Miniſters, to Preach the Goſpel, who have lately been under a ſtorm of Perſecution, for Preaching the Goſpel themſelves? Why do not they, if they pretend to Authority, thruſt out ſome of that great Swarm they have at <hi>London</hi> (that eat the fat and drink the ſweet) to offer the Grace of Chriſt to the poor Country People?</p>
               <p>But ſecondly, Week-day-ſtated-Meetings; and here I muſt declare we had none then fixed, when I gave an Account thereof to the Miniſters at <hi>London,</hi> but they have been agreed on ſince: If it be meant, that we keep ſtated Weekly Lectures in thoſe Places, it is a great miſtake; for that is done but in a very few of theſe Towns.</p>
               <p>Of thirdly, Lords-day-Meetings, which the Church hath appointed, for the Eaſe and Conveniency of the Members, that are at a great Diſtance, as well as for their Feeding and Inſtruction; and now and then Meetings beſides, which Godly Perſons have importun'd for, for the ſakes of their Families and Neighbors.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Accuſation</hi> 2. Several of theſe Meetings are in or near the Places where Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting-Miniſters have their ſtated Congregations and Churches: <hi>Kempſon,</hi> within a Mile of <hi>Bedford.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>At <hi>Willingham,</hi> where Mr. <hi>Worden</hi> Preacheth.</p>
               <p>But he hath no-ſtated Church nor Congregation there, nor indeed did he Atteſt at <hi>Keitering,</hi> as I am inform'd, but only complain'd that we took away his Hearers; It would have been fair to have put down his own words,</p>
               <p>At <hi>Cambridge,</hi> where Mr. <hi>Taylor</hi> is.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="78" facs="tcp:65071:38"/>
But the Majority of his Church hath left him, according to the Rule of God's Word: <hi>Withdraw from every Brother that walks diſorderly:</hi> And to be ſure a Paſtor is a Brother, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3. 6.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Where Mr.</hi> Huſſey <hi>is.</hi> But he hath no Church, but a part of the Church of <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Codgbrook</hi> within a Mile of Mr. <hi>Haycock.</hi> It is but very ſeldom I have Preached there, tho there are ſeveral Members there and thereabouts; yet I ſay here as before, That Church is but a part of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> according to their own Principles; moſt of which ſort of Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es that are ſo called, being ready to return thither again, if the Law ſhould be let loſe to recall them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Frequent Week-day Meetings at Kettering.</hi> I think I never Preached but twice, and that after Night too, excepting what I Preached in Mr. <hi>Med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well</hi>'s Pulpit, with his Conſent; other Brethren going to viſit the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers there, have in their Night-Meetings there for Prayer and Conference, ſpoken a word of Exhortation, and what Offence can there be in all this?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>At</hi> Northampton, <hi>where Mr.</hi> Blower <hi>is:</hi> And there but very ſeldom, when I go to Viſit the Members.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Near Mr.</hi> Gibbs. It is but ſeldom I have been there; it has been kept as a Stated Meeting, by Mr. <hi>Bere, (viz.</hi> at <hi>Olney)</hi> this Eleven Years; and the Meeting is now but the ſame; tho he has left it, but others ſince have ſet up a Meeting in Oppoſition to it. Upon the whole, of theſe proceeding Accuſations, I ſhall put theſe following Queries.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Query</hi> 1. Whether <hi>Bedford, Kempſon</hi> and five Miles round, by any Law of God, or Act of Parliament, be ſo peculiarly appropriated to Mr. <hi>Chand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler? Willingham</hi> and the Towns adjacent to Mr. <hi>Worden? Cambridge</hi> to Mr. <hi>Taylor</hi> and Mr. <hi>Huſſey?</hi> St. <hi>Ives</hi> and the Towns adjacent to Mr. <hi>Billo's? Northampton</hi> to Mr. <hi>Blower? Kettering</hi> to Mr. <hi>Medwell? Creton, Codgbrook,</hi> and the Pariſhes round about, to Mr. <hi>Haycock? Newport,</hi> with a vaſt Circuit round, to Mr. <hi>Gibbs?</hi> So that none muſt dare to preſume to Preach in thoſe fore-mentioned Places, without a Licenſe from them firſt obtained? I may well demand here <hi>Quo Jure?</hi> By what Right do they Exerciſe ſuch a Power and Authority?</p>
               <p>2. Whether if any have cauſe to Complain, doth it not of right, firſt appertain to the Publick Miniſters of thoſe reſpective Pariſhes, who have ſuch determinate Local Bounds and Limits appointed to them by the Laws of the Land? But ſince they are quieted therein by the <hi>Act of Liberty,</hi> ſhould not they that enjoy their outward Tranquility and Privilege, by Vertue of the ſaid <hi>Act,</hi> equal with me, be quiet tool? And manifeſt to the Government and Nation, that a liberty to Serve God according to their Conſciences, is the higheſt point they aim at, and for the enjoyment of which, they are thankful to God and Men?</p>
               <p>3. Whether a Prohibition of me by theſe Men, to come to Preach within ſuch Limits, be not the very ſame with the old Principle of Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, that forbad the <hi>Nonconformiſt,</hi> in general, to Preach within ſuch Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective Dioceſſes, Pariſhes and Corporations, upon heavy Penalties and Forfeitures; and whether theſe Perſons do not manifeſtly declare what they would be at, if they had the Power in their Hands? Do not they
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:65071:38"/>
give early Proof, that their Fingers would be heavier than other Mens Loyns have been, if they could make Sovereign Power truckle to their Wills? Which I pray may never be, if it be the Bleſſed Will of God.</p>
               <p>4. Whether this among my Brethren, being a Principle of the old Perſecuting Leaven, and an Invaſion made upon the Prerogative Royal of Chriſt; We of the Church of <hi>Rothwell,</hi> are not bound in Conſcience to teſtifie againſt it, as appearing in Ours? And whether the greateſt part of this Teſtimony that we are to bear, be not to Preach in thoſe very Places where they forbid us to Preach, in the Name of <hi>Jeſus?</hi> Whether it be not a great piece of Impiety to forbid any Servants of Chriſt to do ſo by human Laws? and whether it is not the higheſt inſolency of Impiety for a few Private Men to do ſo, contrary to the Laws of Man as well as God? Let them ceaſe their Perſecution, and let fall their Perſecuting Spirits, and then there will be no need of our Teſtimony.</p>
               <p>5. Whether if we have Members of our Church living at a diſtance from us, near any of theſe Miniſters, who have by their Unchriſtian and bitter Behaviour, ſo grieved and diſturbed the Minds of our Brethren and Siſters, that they cannot attend upon their Miniſtry to their Edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, we ought not at the earneſt Cryes and importunate Requeſts of theſe our Members (who are committed to our Watch and Care, and their Families in a ſenſe) take care for their Spiritual Feeding, out of the proviſion of this <hi>Sion</hi> they belong to; and in ſo doing, conſult their out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Accomodations, in Charity to their Bodies, Families and Callings, as much as we are able?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lastly.</hi> Whether ſince theſe Miniſters in their reſpective Towns of Abode, repreſent the Truths of the Goſpel we Preach and Profeſs, as execrable Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors to their Hearers; we are not bound in Conſcience, eſpecially on the Requeſt of our Members and other Godly Perſons, to whom theſe Truths have been made Precious, boldly to go into thoſe very Places, to vindicate the Truths of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> thus Aſpers'd, and that by publick Preaching of them?</p>
               <p>When we have received a ſatisfactory Anſwer to theſe Queries, we ſhall then adviſe further about the Practices we are charged with. And now I proceed to conſider the remaining Charges.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Tho deſired to forbear coming to ſeveral of theſe Places, yet perſisted.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reply.</hi> This is an aggravation of the former Charge, becauſe I did not Obey my Lords and Superiors: But did they indeed bear the Rule over me, they ought to be Obeyed in the Lord, only enjoyning his Command, and not Impoſing their own Wills: But what have they to do to Lord it over us? Whilſt we think it our Duty to Perſiſt, and a breach of Duty to Forbear, we ſhall in the name of God, go on, and Obey God rather than Man.</p>
               <p>Accuſation 3. <hi>He Administers the Lord's Supper in Places far distant from each other, as at</hi> Rothwell, Thorpwaterfield, Wormditch, Northampton.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is true, but where is the Crime, as long as this Church is ſo Large? Before they are divided into more Churches, we cannot in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience do otherwiſe; there are many Poor and Craz'd, and Aged at ſuch great Diſtances from us, as cannot come up to <hi>Rothwell,</hi> who alſo have a
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:65071:39"/>
right to all the Ordinances! of Chriſt, for their Spiritual Nouriſhment and Growth in Grace; and it is the Duty of the Church to convey thoſe holy Ordinances as near them as can be: Holy Mr. <hi>Holdcraft</hi> and his Church, Practiſed this for many Years, and found the Bleſſing of God attending their Practice. In tho Exerciſe of this Practice we do not run it up to many Churches in one; for wherever we have the Lord's Supper, there we appoint an Univerſal Church-Meeting, and all may come if they will, or can: However they that come are the Church; and the Meetings that are kept that Day elſewhere, we do not count Meetings by the Appointment of the Church, but only they that cannot go up to the Houſe of God that Day, to that place where we Break Bread; ſpend the time as they can in their reſpective Places, being aſſiſted by a Gifted Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or two.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Accuſation</hi> 4. He hath taken in Members of other Churches, without any Diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation; Yea, againſt the will of the Paſtor and Church.</p>
               <p>I confeſs this is a diſorderly Practice, that I ought to be humbled for, if it can be proved; but lets examine the particular Proof. <hi>He hath took Mr.</hi> Bere <hi>from Mr.</hi> Gibbs. <hi>Robert Page</hi> is here found a falſe Witneſs againſt his Neighbors, for Mr. <hi>Bere</hi> is no Member of us to this day: The truth of the ſtory is this; There hath been a long Difference between Mr. <hi>Holdcraft</hi> with his Church, and Mr. <hi>Bere</hi> and they were mutually Reconcil'd before Mr. <hi>Holdcraft</hi>'s death, and he ſtands a Member there ſtill; but how comes this to be our Fault, and why muſt we be beaten for this? Thomas Hob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bye <hi>from Mr.</hi> Billoe. When he came and offer'd himſelf to us, he decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red he never made any kind of Profeſſion of Faith, either to Mr. <hi>Billoe,</hi> or to his People, or any manner of Covenant either Implicit or Explicit: Therefore we thought we might take him with the ſame Diſmiſſion from them, as from the Pariſh-Churches, and they of the Pariſh-Churches make as great a Confeſſion of Faith as they, and are under as Implicit a Form of Covenant as they; yet they make no Conſcience of taking away their Members from them, who are as good a Church as themſelves, and that without diſmiſſion, and againſt their Wills too. In ſhort, we lookt upon Mr. <hi>Billoe</hi>'s Church to be no Church then in Goſpel Order; and therefore we know no Reaſon why they ſhould not ſeparate from them as well as from others. <hi>[One of</hi> Cayſoe <hi>Church.]</hi> That People, through the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Cunning of two or three, and of the Sloth and Cowardiſe of others, becauſe of a long Neglect of Ordinances and Order, even for the ſpace of 11 or 12 Years, and the increaſe of notorious Diſorders, Hatreds, Animo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities and Malice, with other Evils to an incurable height, had broken them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; The Lord having for their Non-repentance removed the Candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick out of his place, ſeveral of them tired with, and groaning under thoſe unſupportable Diſorders and Confuſions, by the Advice of Divines, (eſpecially Reverend Mr. <hi>Cockain</hi> (now in Glory) as I am informed, did relate their Experience to one another anew; alſo collected together by a Renewal of Covenant, choſe Officers, and proceeded to Adminiſter the long neglected Ordinances of the Goſpel: Since which time I am inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed they have experienced more Sweetneſs and Comfort in their own

Souls: The Miniſtry of the Word among them, hath been bleſt with greater Succeſs, for Edification and Converſion than ever before. Then others in that Univerſal Wrack, went ſome one way, and ſome another, as their Judgments liked beſt; and ſome of them came over to us, and we judged we might very well receive them; nor are we convinc'd of any Evil in ſo doing.</p>
               <p>Goody <hi>Page</hi> of <hi>Creton.</hi> There is one Goody <hi>Page</hi> of <hi>Brickſworth</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth to us, but we knew not that ſhe was of any Church; if ſhe was, they had no Paſtor then; and by their own Principles, when the Paſtor is dead, the People are at liberty to go where they pleaſe.</p>
               <p>Accuſation 5. <hi>He hath broken Churches, and cauſed Diviſions and Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.</hi> (Ay, but where?) Mr. <hi>Taylor's Church at</hi> Cambridge <hi>broken.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I ſhall give a ſhort Account how far we were concerned with them, and then it may be judged whether we have Broken them.</p>
               <p>Laſt Summer was twelve Months, I received a Letter ſubſcribed by Mr. <hi>Taylor</hi> and ſome of the Brethren, to ſupply his Place two Lord's days during his Abſence; which accordingly I did, by the conſent of the Church; and whilſt I was amongſt them, did endeavour to Reconcile them and ſome Members of Mr. <hi>Holdcroft</hi>'s Church: I then left them, and ſaw them no more for ſeveral Months: I occaſionally Preached af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards by Mr. <hi>Taylor</hi>'s conſent, and in his hearing; and he ſeemed then to approve of my Sermon. A conſiderable time after that, I received a Letter from them, agreed upon at their Church-Meeting, deploring their Caſe, that their Paſtor was Ill, their Meetings Deſtitute, and earneſtly entreating ſome Aſſiſtance; whereupon the Church conſented to ſend over ſome of their ableſt-Gifted Brethren, whoſe Service God made ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable to them; and amongſt the reſt, I took my turn for one Lord's<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day: When he was able to Preach himſelf, we deſiſted; in the mean time, he grew into many Heats and Paſſions with divers of them; upon ſundry accounts, uttering at times (as they ſay) many evil and Unchri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian-like Speeches and Expreſſions. which was a great Grievance to them. During this Conſert, they happen'd to invite one of our Brethren to Preach on a Week-day, which he in a very Violent manner Oppoſed; yet he being ſent to, and refuſing to Preach himſelf, at laſt our Brother Exerciſed amongſt them. Upon this they had a Meeting, Mr. <hi>Hayworth</hi> and Mr. <hi>Millway</hi> were preſent, endeavouring to reconcile their Differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences; whereas, they told me, they gained this Point as they thought, tho not with his particular Conſent, yet without Oppoſition from him, <hi>They might bring any of the Servants of Christ to Preach among them when he did not.</hi> Shortly after, They invited another Brother: When the Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was appointed and the People were Aſſembled, he and Mr. <hi>Huſſey</hi> came in, declaring their Reſolutions to Oppoſe; whereupon great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſts aroſe between them, and our Brother hearing thereof, prudently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined coming into the Place: When the Meeting was defeated, they both went away (as it is reported) Triumphing in and unbecoming manner.</p>
               <p>This occaſioned further Animoſities and Feuds amongſt them; and he going on in a way of Railery, Rage and Reproach, the Majority of them
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:65071:40"/>
being offended at theſe and other great Evils, at laſt withdrew from Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of him, and then they deſired our further Aſſiſtance, which we could not in Conſcience deny them, unleſs we would deliver them up to his Arbitrary Rage and Tyranny, and Eſtabliſh alſo a dangerous Prcedent for Paſtors to Lord it over God's Heritage.</p>
               <p>In this Account I have been very Modeſt, leaving it to them to State their own Caſe in a publick Narrative, which they know beſt, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they are moſt concerned, which I think they are bound to do, for to Vindicate themſelves and us, who aſſiſted them in their Extremity. I ſhall therefore do no more, but conclude my Defence upon theſe Heads, with theſe following Queries.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Query</hi> 1. Whether a Paſtor be not under the watch and care of a Church of Chriſt, as well as private Members?</p>
               <p>2. Whether if a Paſtor offends againſt Chriſt's Rules, he ought not to be dealt with as well as a private Brother; eſpecially ſince his evil actings bring more diſhonor to the Name of Chriſt, than the evils of a private Brother?</p>
               <p>3. Whether a Paſtor, or any Officer, being thus under the Church Admonition, they ought to continue to Preach, ſince it is expreſly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt that Rule of Chriſt, <hi>Matt.</hi> 5. 23, 24?</p>
               <p>4. Whether if ſuch a Paſtor or Officer continue ſo to do, going on wilfully in the impenitency and hardneſs of his Heart, refuſing to hear the Church, he ought not ſpeedily to be brought to Repentance, or elſe the Ordinance of the Lord Jeſus be ſpeedily executed againſt him?</p>
               <p>5. Whether this maketh up the ſeven Churches Mr. <hi>Chandler</hi> ſaith I broke, confidently affirming it to my Face, before divers Witneſſes, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he had written to the ſame purpoſe, to a private Friend in <hi>London?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He hath broken them at</hi> Willingham.</p>
               <p>How could I break them that were never whole? And they are but ſome ſcattered Members of Mr. <hi>Holdcraft</hi>'s Church. But the plain mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Fact, as I underſtand, is this, He being ſent down amongſt them at the requeſt of a few, upon the account of that Reverend Perſon that ſent him down, they were willing to make tryal of him for a time, and ſo they retained him for a Year; in that time growing into Diſſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with his Judgment in the Faith and order of the Goſpel, and not approving of his Converſation, they gave him fair notice thereof; but he not willing to part with them, till he had a louder Call; and ſince it was not in their power to thruſt them from the Place, they thought they had the liberty in common Equity, to make ſuch proviſion for their own Edifications, as they judged moſt ſuitable and neceſſary.</p>
               <p>Accuſation 6. <hi>He hath declared it to be his Opinion, that he is happy who is an Inſtrument in breaking all the Churches.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſwer.</hi> I declared, that this was the Judgment of that great Man of God, Dr. <hi>Owen,</hi> now in Glory, <hi>That it would be beſt for the Intereſt of Christ if all the Diſſenting Churches in</hi> England <hi>were broken, and would gather anew of thoſe that were thorough for Chriſt:</hi> Without declaring my own Opinion, as will be atteſted by Mr. <hi>Ellis,</hi> Mrs. <hi>Ellis</hi> Mr. <hi>Watts,</hi> Mr. <hi>Sendall,</hi> that were
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:65071:40"/>
then preſent: But I know not but he may be prophetick in his Opinion, if God giveth not Repentance. Furthermore, he hath affirmed, <hi>That for two years all the Churches are gone a Whoring from Chriſt.</hi> I did not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member this when I firſt ſaw it, but ſince one preſent remembred me of it, I think I ſpake ſomething of it; yet the ſame worthy Perſon aſſured me it is not rightly reported; and indeed <hi>I</hi> think it was very unfriendly, and unchriſtian like, to trumpet to the World in an odious Libel, and then publickly to witneſs what paſt by way of Lamentation in private Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe: However as to what is alledged, <hi>I</hi> wiſh it were not too to true. They muſt needs be of a deep <hi>Laodicean</hi> Spirit, that do not obſerve very great Declenſions and Forſakings of their firſt Love, upon the beſt Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of Chriſt in <hi>England;</hi> and this in Scripture Phraſe is going a Whoring from the Lord; and muſt it be an Offence to uſe Scripture-Language? <hi>I</hi> heartily wiſh that inſtead of raging againſt the Truth, they would ſeriouſly conſider it, and conſider their own Wages. <hi>He being told how comfortably the Miniſters had lived formerly together, replied with heat; It was the Goſpel he Preached made all the Diſturbance, for which he brought</hi> Matth. 10. <hi>Chriſt came not to bring Peace on Earth but a Sword.</hi> That Paſſage is falſly father'd upon me. <hi>That the Goſpel I Preached made all the Diſturbance.</hi> The truth of the Matter is this; That queſtion being very often, and I thought, very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>candidly put unto me, <hi>viz.</hi> What was the Reaſon there was more Diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance ſince I came than formerly? I made Anſwer only repeating theſe words, <hi>Luke</hi> 12. 49. Any unbyaſs'd Perſon may ſee with half an Eye, that they are guilty of Miſtakes upon Miſtakes, for they ſay I named <hi>Mat.</hi> 10. 34. whereas the words I ſaid were theſe; <hi>I am come to ſend Fire on the Earth, &amp;c.</hi> 'Tis alſo evident what a captious Queſtion it was, and with an inſnaring Deſign it was propoſed; as it hath ſince more plainly appeared by the Event. This muſt needs, in every impartial Judgment, juſtifie me, in keeping at a Diſtance from ſuch Perſons; and if I be providentially caſt into their Company, to treat them with extreme Caution. However, as to the Anſwer then given, it was not in a light and haſty Spirit, for I have not ſeen cauſe to repent of it ſince; Time, the Parent of Truth, may make it more and more Manifeſt.</p>
               <p>Accuſation 7. <hi>He ſaid that Mr.</hi> Shepard <hi>was an Enemy to Chriſt and the Goſpel. Anſw.</hi> I muſt needs ſay, I am ſorry he has manifeſted ſuch Enmity di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers ways: I need go at preſent no further than the Libel, and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment he appears to have in it; other actings of his I could Inſtance in, which were not ſo much againſt me, for I have done him no harm, but againſt the Goſpel and Intereſt of the Lord Jeſus. <hi>That Mr.</hi> Medwell <hi>had done more Miſchief in two Years, than he could repair in all his Life.</hi> I cannot deny but that I ſaid, I being provoked thereunto, by one that came, like them of old, feigning himſelf to be a Juſt Man, for to enſnare; I was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards very much grieved for ſpeaking theſe words in a Paſſion: But as to the truth thereof, <hi>I</hi> felt ſomewhat of it when <hi>I</hi> was Indicted at the Aſſizes, for Preaching the Goſpel; but <hi>I</hi> ſhall forbear to produce inſtances to this purpoſe out of reſpect to Mr. <hi>Medwell;</hi> but this is generally known, That moſt of our Perſecutors and Revilers, Prophane as well as Profeſſors, take
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:65071:41"/>
more Encouragement from Mr. <hi>Medwell</hi>'s favouring the Oppoſition, than others to act as they do. <hi>Others he called Dry Sticks, Scribes, Phariſees, Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>galiſts, Baals-Prieſts.</hi> It is not proved, that <hi>I</hi> called any ſo in particular, and if <hi>I</hi> exclaimed againſt ſuch Evil Perſons in general; why may not <hi>I</hi> againſt them as well as againſt Drunkards, Swearers, Whore-mongers, Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemers and Sabbath-breakers? It is paſt all doubt there have been in all Ages ſuch ſorts of evil Men. <hi>Africa</hi> was never more Fertile in Monſters, than this preſent Age doth abound with, ſuch ſorts of monſtrous Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, that <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt,</hi> our Bleſſed Lord, and his Diſciples, ſo ſeverely envied againſt. If <hi>I</hi> have ſaid ſo, <hi>I</hi> ſay ſo; let the Guilty in City and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try ſhare it among themſelves. <hi>He ſaid, I care not for all the Elders in</hi> Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, <hi>they are moſt of them</hi> Arminians, Amiraldiſts <hi>and</hi> Baxterians. This <hi>I</hi> ſaid in my Haſte, that the Miniſters of <hi>London</hi> ſhould not be my Judges, being many of them <hi>Arminians, Amiraldiſts</hi> and <hi>Baxterians,</hi> which appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to be too true, tho no truth ought to be ſpoken in Paſſion, and in our own Spirits; but is it not matter of Lamentation?</p>
               <q>
                  <l>—Pudet hoec opprobria dici,</l>
                  <l>Et dici potuiſſe, &amp; non potuiſſe refelli.</l>
               </q>
               <p>That late Book come forth with the New Goſpel uſhered into the World with 16 Names, with a <hi>Thraſonic</hi> Boaſt of greater numbers ready to join theſe, ſufficiently proved me to be no Lyer; <hi>I</hi> wiſh the Author would have tarried to have took them all in, that we might have known the ſtrength of his Party; but ſince we hear they have appear'd in great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers indeed, yet all that will not do; Truth may be clamour'd againſt, but can't be overturn'd by Multitudes. But it is very remarkable, that the Reverend Aſſembly ſend ſuch an one to judge of a Church of Chriſt, and of their Faith and Order, at <hi>Kettering,</hi> in great State and Pomp, when he had newly declar'd himſelf in Print, to be the Admired Head of the <hi>Neonomian</hi> Sect, or in plain <hi>Engliſh,</hi> the New-Law-men, to wit, a Law they had ſet up in Contradiction to God's Law, (having clearly aboliſht that) requiring imperfect ſinful Obedience, in ſtead of what is Perfect and Sinleſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Accuſation</hi> 8. He with the Church at <hi>Rothwell,</hi> ſend forth many Illitterate and Ignorant Preachers, without Adviſing with Neighboring Miniſters.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> So we do, and ſo we will do, in the Name of the Lord; we think it very ſtrange we ſhould be compelled to adviſe with them, who by their late Actions have declared themſelves to be perverters of the Goſpel, and favourers of the <hi>Neonomian</hi> Party, clucking under Mr. <hi>William</hi>'s Wings, as their great Patron and Defender; we ſhall ask their Advice when we think it meet: Advice muſt be free, given when asked, and not impoſed: Impoſed Advice is an act of Authority. <hi>One of which ſaid Chriſt Murthered himſelf.</hi> Here is no particular Evidence, and it is a down-right Falſhood, after a great Noiſe about it. In the Notes of his Sermon produced, it was thus; <hi>Chriſt as High-Prieſt had in charge given him to kill the Sacrifice, and by virtue of Office he killed the Sacrifice, and himſelf was the Sacrifice. Down with Works, down with Law.</hi> This was father'd upon Mr. <hi>Bere,</hi> who is none of us, but hath been an approved Preacher above this 30 Years; who ſaith
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:65071:41"/>
he did ſay ſo in point of Juſtification, and he will ſtand by it, and ſo he may; for the Word of God doth ſtand by him in it. <hi>Another, Chriſt went about his work Blindfold,</hi> from that place of Scripture, <hi>Who ſo blind as my Servant?</hi> Which another Interpreted thus, <hi>Chriſt is blind ſo as to ſee no Sin in his People.</hi> To this charge, there is no particular Evidence; and the Perſon Charged, is not Named, and we know nothing of it; Therefore <hi>I</hi> need do no more but ſtep over it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Another thus, When People are under Convictions they will go to the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, and he will exhort them to Read and Pray, and Repent; but theſe are the black marks of Hell.</hi> This laſt ſpoken by Mr. <hi>Rowlett.</hi> I enquired of him, and he ſaith, he remembers no ſuch thing: However, this I will main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, they that put awakened Souls upon Working before Believing, Act beſide the Commiſſion given forth by <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Accuſation. 9. <hi>Mr.</hi> Davis <hi>pretended to Viſions for Preaching a Funeral Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon at</hi> Oundle, <hi>he told the People,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>That I pretended to Viſions, is very falſe: But what if I had ſaid I had ſeen Viſions? How ſhould they know it was but Pretence? Mr. <hi>Clark</hi> in his <hi>Examples,</hi> giveth divers Modern Inſtances of ſeveral Godly Perſons that ſaw Viſions; and why might not I, as well as they? Tho I do not ſay I have ſeen any; but the Matter at <hi>Oundle,</hi> was plainly thus; I hearing when I was from Home on <hi>Thurſday,</hi> from Mrs. <hi>Clark</hi>'s Son, that his Mother was not expected to Live that Night; I came home that Night, and found ſome of my Acquaintance were Dead nigher home; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon that Night, after Mid-night, I was ſunk into ſerious Meditations of the Glory of Heaven, and upon that part of their Glory, that they were not only Bleſt there with perfect Holineſs, but alſo with Eternal conſtant Beatifical Viſions of the imputed Righteouſneſs they were cloathed with. Amongſt other Meditations, I thought I ſaw by Faith, how bright then the Spirits of Juſt ones Above, ſhone in that Righteouſneſs, and amongſt them, thoſe Friends lately Dead as I heard: And her I concluded Dead, from a ſtrong Impulſe I confeſs, which I ſuppoſe might ariſe from the Account her Son gave me of her in the day-time; and knowing her to be a very good Woman, <hi>I</hi> did by Faith, conclude and ſee, ſhe made one in the bright Company above; whereupon that Scripture was Suggeſted into my Mind, with great pleaſantneſs, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 57. 2. That Text <hi>I</hi> would have Preached upon for her Funeral Sermon, if another had not been appointed me: However, <hi>I</hi> ventured a little at the cloſe, to inſiſt upon this Subject, and gave ſome of the ſubſtance of the precedent Story as my Reaſon for it, wherein <hi>I</hi> think <hi>I</hi> might uſe theſe words, <hi>That it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prest upon my mind ſhe was Dead, and that by Faith I ſaw her in Glory,</hi> which the miſtaken Witneſſes, that know little of Faith, took to be other Viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. It appeared by the Sequel, that ſhe was then Dead, and if Dead, then in Glory, as <hi>I</hi> thought. What need the Learned Aſſembly make ſuch a Pother and ado about this? <hi>I</hi> would fain hear their weighty Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, why the Servants of God now may not ſee Viſions as formerly? Doth not <hi>Zuinglius</hi> write of himſelf, that when he was urged by the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling Prieſts to produce a Parallel place of Scripture to prove that <hi>This
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:65071:42"/>
is my Body,</hi> was a Sacramental ſaying; was after much perplexity of Mind, directed in a Dream, to that portion of Scripture, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. 11. latter part, which the Scoffing <hi>Papists</hi> made as much a Maye-game of then, as the vain and jovial Profeſſors do of this.</p>
               <p>Accuſation 10. <hi>That he Anoints the Sick with Oil, is confeſsed both by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and Friends,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>That we Anoint the Sick with Oil, we do confeſs, and continue ſtill to think it is a Duty from God's Word: The Story of the Deceaſed Perſon I grant, with ſome variation of Circumſtances, is true: She did not then in the Adminiſtration of the Ordinance, as I hear, profeſs any great confidence of Faith, but only teſtified her willingneſs to be obedient to the Command of the Lord Jeſus; neither did I hear that any of her Relations did; I think I might ſay, in Preaching or Praying, (and that not amiſs) That God upon the finiſhing of the work of any of his Children given them to do, will have them home to their Father's Houſe, and will deny all Means and his Bleſſing to all his own Appointments, which muſt needs be true, elſe his Children would never Die. But what needs all this inſolent Triumphing? Is this becoming Chriſtians? I am perſwaded it will be but ſhort.—When the Apoſtles were endowed with extraordinary power for Miracles; yet there was a Caſe came before them that even they through the power of Unbelief could prevail nothing in: If Modeſty did not forbid me, I could Ballance this one with twenty or thirty aſtoniſhing Inſtances; however, I ſubmit to the Rebuke, which has coſt me many thoughts of Heart, and hath brought me to theſe Conſiderations,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Whether God in the Sick or in the Adminiſtrators requires only a meer Faith of Relyance or Expectance, leaving the Iſſue to his Bleſſed Will. Or,</p>
               <p n="2">2. Whether he doth not require in both, a poſitive Faith, that it ſhall be ſo without the leaſt doubting or wavering; and that none dare preſume to engage in it before they have arriv'd to ſuch a Faith. I heſitate and wait for the Counſels of the Almighty, before I proceed further: Alſo my Judgment in this Ordinance I ſhall (when I have time) draw up.</p>
               <p>Accuſation 11. <hi>He Re-baptized one formerly Baptized by Mr.</hi> Browning, <hi>namely the Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of one Mr.</hi> Chambers.</p>
               <p>As to this it's true, there was a Brother of that Name Baptiſed according to our Pract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ice, but it was never enquired whether he was Baptiſed by Mr. <hi>Browning</hi> or any Body elſe. We whoſe Judgments are for this Practice, neither Preach it, Preſs it, nor Impoſe it, but walk according to our Light, which we think we have a liberty to do. What then hath the Aſſembly at <hi>London,</hi> to do with our private Practice? As to my particular Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion concerning Baptiſm, I ſhall take another time to lay it down.</p>
               <p>The chief managers of the Evidence at <hi>Kettering</hi> as I underſtand, was Mr, <hi>Chadler</hi> and Mr. <hi>King:</hi> Never was Captain <hi>Hilton</hi> more buſie and active: One ſhould have thought Mr. <hi>Chandler</hi> ſhould have received ſome Check from a ſore Providence that befell him a few days before; But where will not Pride and Fury drive?</p>
               <p>Thus I have Indulg'd the Curioſity of ſome Men, with what was done at <hi>Kettering,</hi> and of others with an Anſwer thereunto. The Fable tells us, That the Mountains were in Travail: The Rumour thereof diſperſed every where; People flock'd together from all Parts to ſee this Prodigious Birth: At laſt to their Diſappointment, out comes a ridiculous Mouſe, which ran away. Now the Mouſe is let loſe into the World, but not without both Marks and Fetters. It is enough that I have diverted thus far from the weighty Service of Chriſt. This Diverſion I ſhould not have been guilty of, had not great neceſſity and importunity called me thereunto. I am aware this will be one of Satan's deſigns, by irri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating me to Reply's and Rejoynders, not only to ſtir up my Paſſion, and mingle Self there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, but to make me neglect that weighty neceſſary Work of Preaching the Goſpel and feeding the Flock of God, over which he hath made me Overſeer; the Lord help me to be upon my Watch in that matter. Yet I do not ſay, but I may meet them again in their full career of Wickedneſs, or at leaſt defend the Goſpel again when the Lord ſhall give me a ſpecial Call therunto; and tho I am Raſh and Ignorant, yet my Learned Brethren en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in the ſame Cauſe, I hope will not be Offended, if I maintain my Poſt in the ſtrength of Chriſt, as he ſhall aſſiſt me: However, this I am reſolved in the ſtrength of Grace, not
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:65071:42"/>
to ſtop at every Stone thrown. I am perſwaded, all their attempts will be to their own Overthrow. As for me, I have committed my ſelf with the Cauſe that I manage, to him that is able to ſupport and maintain all.</p>
               <p>If there be any Errors I maintain, I care not how ſoon they fall, tho I fell with them: Nay, if I could be convinced that I Erroneouſly worded any Matter, I ſhould ſoon publickly declare againſt my own Wording: It is not my own Honor I ſeek, but the Honor of him that ſent me; and I hope I am always ready to Bury my own Honor in Shame, provided I could ſecure thereby his Name from Diſhonor and Contempt: I ſhould think hard of no Confeſſion of mine that ſhould give Glory to God: But if it be the Truth of Chriſt, I am Aſſaulted for, (as thereto I am perſwaded it is) then all the attempts againſt it will be in vain: his Truth is like himſelf, Eternal, and will abide Stedfaſt, bright and Inſuperable, when I and my Oppoſers are Mouldred to Duſt and Aſhes.</p>
               <p>In Parting, I ſhall again recommend to them <hi>Gamaliel</hi>'s prudent Advice, <hi>viz.</hi> To let us alone; for if this Councel be not of God, it will fall of it ſelf: But if it be of God, it ſhall ſtand in ſpight of all their Rage and Perſecution, and they themſelves will at laſt be found fighters againſt God.</p>
               <p>As I have declared to the Reader what Principles I conſent to, and declare my approbation of, ſo I ſhall now declare what Doctrins I cannot conſent to, but declare my Abhorrence of; and they are thoſe Principles Methodiſed by Dr. <hi>Chancey,</hi> in the beginning of a late Tract of his, in Anſwer to Mr. <hi>Dan.

               <p>But this is unqueſtionable, that all Doctrins and Inferences, lean on ſome Foundation-Truths; and it's as evident, that theſe Doctrins that are of the Superſtructure, may be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcerned by the Foundation they lean on, and the Foundation by them, reduce any Doctrin to its own Fundamental; and then it will appear in its own proper hew and Colour. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore for a Concluſion, I ſhall lay down the Fundamentals of the Goſpel, being the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion Principles of the Old Proteſtant Doctrin in one Column, and the Fundamentals of the late invented Goſpel in an oppoſite Column; it being the very Scheme word for word, Drawn up by Mr. <hi>Troughton</hi> in his <hi>Lutherus Redivivus.</hi>

               <p>I. <hi>Of the Scripture.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE Holy Scripture of the Old and New Teſtament, are the Word of God, and the only Rule of Faith and Life.</p>
               <p>II. <hi>Of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is but one only the living and true God, who is a Spirit Infinite, Eternal and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable in his Being, Wiſdom, Power, Holineſs, Goodneſs and Truth. There are three Perſons

in the God-head, the Father eternally begetting, the Son eternally begotten of the Father, and the Holy Ghoſt eternally proceeding from the Father and the Son, the ſame in Eſſence, equal in all the incommunicable and communicable Attributes of the Divine Nature.</p>
               <p>III. <hi>Of God's Decree.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Decrees of God are his Eternal Purpoſe, according to the Council of his Will, whereby for his own Glory, he hath fore-ordain'd whatſoever comes to paſs; which Decrees he executes in the Works of Creation and Providence.</p>
               <p>IV. <hi>Of Creation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The work of Creation is God's making all things of nothing, by the word of his Power, in the ſpace of ſix Days, and all very good; and after other Creatures, he Created Man Male and Female, after his own Image, in Knowledge, Righteouſneſs, Holineſs; with Dominion over the Creatures.</p>
               <p>V. <hi>Of Providence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>God's Works of Providence are his moſt Holy, Wiſe, and Powerful, Preſerving and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all his Creatures and all their Actions.</p>
               <p>VI. <hi>The Covenant of Works.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When God Created Man, he entred into a Covenant of Life with him, as the common Head and Repreſentative of all Mankind, upon condition of perfect Obedience; forbidding him to Eat of the Tree of Knowledge, of Good and Evil, upon pain of Death; which Covenant our firſt Parents (being left to the freedom of their own Will) broke, and ſo fell from the Eſtate wherein they were Created, by ſinning againſt God, and all Mankind, deſcending from <hi>Adam</hi> by ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Generation, ſinn edwith him, and Fell with him in his firſt Tranſgreſſion.</p>
               <p>VII. <hi>Of Sin by the Fall.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Sinfulneſs of every Man deſcending from <hi>Adam</hi> by an ordinary Generation, conſiſts in the Guilt of <hi>Adam</hi>'s firſt Sin, the want of Original Righteouſneſs, and the Corruption of his whole Nature; which is commonly call'd Original Sin, together with all Actual Sins, whereby he is oppoſite to all Good, and bent to all Evil, and liable to God's Wrath, the Curſe of the Law, Death, and all Miſeries, Spiritual, Temporal and Eternal. The remainders of this Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſinful Nature acts even in the Saints, when their State is changed through Grace.</p>
               <p>VIII. <hi>Of Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Chriſt Jeſus the Eternal Son of God became Man, being conceived in the Womb of the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin <hi>Mary,</hi> by the Holy-Ghoſt, and thereby taking our Nature upon him, continueth to be God and Man in two diſtinct Natures and one Perſon for ever.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>IX.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, both in his humbled and exalted ſtate, executeth the Office of a Prophet, of a Prieſt, and of a King, to his Church.</p>
               <p>X. <hi>Of the Prophetical Office of Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Chriſt executes the Office of a Prophet, in the times both of the Old and New Teſtament, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealing by his Word and Spirit, the whole Mind and Will of God for Man's Salvation.</p>
               <p>XI. <hi>Of the Prieſthood of Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Chriſt executeth the Office of a Prieſt, in once offering up himſelf a Sacrifice without Spot to God, to be a Reconciliation for the Sins of all them that ſhall be Saved, and in making continual Interceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for them at the Right Hand of the Majeſty on High.</p>
               <p>XII. <hi>Of the Kingly Office of Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Chriſt, as our Redeemer, executeth the Office of a King, in calling out of the World a People to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, in Ruling and Defending them, and in reſtraining and conquering all his and their Enemies.</p>
               <p>XIII. <hi>Of the Covenant of Grace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Covenant of Grace was made with Chriſt, as the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> and in him with all the Elect as his Seed, and was made manifeſt by freely providing and offering to Sinners a Mediator and Life, and Salvation through him.</p>
               <p>XIV. <hi>Of Iuſtification.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thoſe whom God effectually Calleth, he alſo freely Juſtifieth; not by infuſing Righteouſneſs into them, but by pardoning their Sins, and by accounting and accepting their Perſons as Righteous; not for any thing wrought in them, or done by them, but for Chriſt's ſake alone; not by imputing Faith it ſelf, nor any other Evangelical Obedience unto them as their Righteouſneſs, but by imputing the Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and Satisfaction of Chriſt unto them: They receiving and reſting on him and his Righteouſneſs by Faith, which Faith they have not of themſelves, it is the Gift of God: And this Faith is not a dead Faith, but worketh by Love, and is accompanied with all other ſaving Graces.</p>
               <p>XV. <hi>Of Faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Faith in the General, is a giving credit to the whole revealed Mind and Will of God in his Word and upon his own Authority; but as it is a ſaving Grace, it is a work of the Spirit, whereby a Sinner doth ſee and behold Chriſt in all his Excellencies, and is perſuaded and enabled to look to him, to go
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:65071:44"/>
forth from Sin and Self, to lay hold of Chriſt, and to reſt and relie on Chriſt and his Righteouſneſs, for Acceptance with God and Eternal Salvation.</p>
               <p>XVI. <hi>Of Effectual Calling.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Effectual Calling is the powerful Voice of the Son of God by his Spirit, accompanying his Word, whereby a Sinner is enabled to accept of Chriſt upon his own Terms, according to the Promiſe of the Goſpel; therefore it relates to Faith.</p>
               <p>XVII. <hi>Of Aſſurance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Aſſurance is not a bare conjectural and probable Perſuaſion, but the infallible certainty of Faith found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon the Teſtimony of the Spirit of Adoption, witneſſing with our Spirits, that we are the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God; altho many Believers have not attained to this Aſſurance, yet it is the Duty of all to ſeek after it, and thoſe that have attained to it may have it divers ways ſhaken and diminiſh'd through Sin and Temptations.</p>
               <p>XVIII. <hi>Of Perſeverance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Perſeverance of the Saints, depends not upon their own Free Will or inherent Grace already received; but upon the Immutability of the Love of God in the Decree of Election, the Efſicay and Merit of the Interceſſion of Chriſt: The Nature of the Covenant of Grace, and the abiding of the Spirit of God. Altho true Believers cannot fall finally and totally, yet they may fall into grievous Sins, and may continue in them for a while, whereby they grieve the Spirit, leſſen their Comforts, wound their Conſciences, ſcandaliſe others, and do come under the Rebuke of God's fatherly Corrections for their Recovery and Amendment.</p>
               <p>XIX. <hi>Of Adoption.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Adoption is an act of the free Grace of God, in and for his only Son Jeſus Chriſt, whereby all thoſe that are juſtified are received into the number of his Children, have his Name put upon them, the Spirit of his Son given unto them, are under his fatherly Care and Correction, admitted to all the Liberties and Privileges of the Sons of God, made Heirs of all the Promiſes and Fellow-heirs with Chriſt in Glory.</p>
               <p>XX. <hi>Of Sanctification.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sanctification is the Work of God's Grace, whereby they whom God has before the Foundation of the World, choſen to be Holy, are in time through the powerful Operation of the Spirit, applying the Death and Reſurrection of Chriſt unto them, renew'd in their whole Man after the Image of God, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Seeds of Repentance; and of all other ſaving Graces put into their Hearts, and thoſe Graces ſo ſtirred up, increaſed and ſtrengthned, as that they more and more dye unto Sin, and riſe up unto Newneſs of Life in the lively Actings and Exerciſes of Faith.</p>
               <p>XXI. <hi>Of Repentance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>True Goſpel Repentance, is a ſaving Grace, wrought by the Spirit of God, whereby we are enabled thorough believing on the Lord Jeſus Chriſt for Life and Salvation, to turn from Sin unto God.</p>
               <p>XXII. <hi>Preparatory Works.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Works done before Faith, (however good in themſelves) yet are vain, fruitleſs, ſinful, and not pleaſing to God; and therefore can't make us any ways meet for the receiving of Grace.</p>
               <p>XXIII. <hi>Of Good Works.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Good Works are then only Good, when they are the Fruits of Faith, and they ought to be carefully maintain'd by Believers, not that they may thereby be juſtified or continued in a juſtified State; but that they may glorifie God, and anſwer the Ends of their Redemption by Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>XXIV. <hi>Of the Moral Law.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Moral Law holds the Elect during their Unregeneracy under its condemning Force 'till they believe; and is unto all Believers a Rule for Obedience, which they are enabled to conform unto by the Power of God's Grace.</p>
               <p>XXV. <hi>Of the State of Believers after Death, and their Reſurrection.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Souls of Believers immediately after Death, are made perfect in Holineſs, are received up to Heaven, and behold the Face of God in Light and Glory. Their Bodies in the mean time reſting in the Grave till the Reſurrection, are then Re-united to their Souls in Perfect Bleſſedneſs, and full En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of God forever.</p>
               <p>XXVI. <hi>Of the Laſt Iudgment.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>God has appointed a Day wherein he will Judge the Quick and the Dead in Righteouſneſs by Jeſus Chriſt, to whom all Power and Judgment is given of the Father for the Glorifying his Divine Mercy in the Salvation of the Elect, and of his Divine Juſtice in the Eternal Damnation of the Wicked and Diſobedient.</p>

            </byline>
            <p>OH that my Head was a Fountain of Tears, that I could Weep Day and Night for a Generation of Men profeſſing love to Chriſt and Souls, and yet their Mouths are full of Revilings, and their Pens dipt in Gall as the firſt Page teſtifieth, and ſeveral other places in the Book; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they act like that Orator <hi>Tertullus</hi> in <hi>Acts 24. 5. We have found this Man a peſtilent fellow, and a mover of Sedition among all the</hi> Jews <hi>throughout the World, and a Ring-leader of the Sect of the</hi> Nazarens, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Thus he accuſed, and the <hi>Jews</hi> aſſented, ſaying, <hi>That theſe things were ſo,</hi> verſ. 9. And thus do the Writers of this Pamphlet accuſe God's Servant, Mr. <hi>Davis;</hi> with many others, which I queſtion not but they are dear to our Lord Jeſus: But yet the People are ready to ſay all is true that can be ſpoken; yea, this I obſerve, theſe Men will believe the Reports of the worſt of Men againſt him, when they will not believe their neareſt Friends, that ſpeak for him, tho what they ſpeak they have ſeriouſly weigh'd, which ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them to be of their minds <hi>Jeremy</hi> complaineth of, Chap. 20. 10. <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, ſay they, and we will Report it.</hi> But I believe the Lord in his own time will vindicate the Faith and Order of that Goſpel, which is now op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by a Generation of Men, that have not the Power of Godlineſs: However I earneſtly intreat all that fear the Lord to ceaſe Reviling and take <hi>Paul</hi>'s Counſel, <hi>Epheſians 4. 31, 32. Let all Bitterneſs and Wrath, and Anger, and Clamor, and evil ſpeaking be put away, and be ye kind one to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other—</hi>And if you yet be in doubt, take <hi>Gamaliel</hi>'s Counſel, <hi>Acts</hi> 5. 38, 39. For we are very willing that whatever there is that is not of God ſhould fall, and we are alſo ſure, that whatever is of God you cannot overturn it, therefore pray have a Care you be not found fighters againſt God: And pray weigh very ſeriouſly what Mr. <hi>Davis</hi> hath written in anſwer to what is charged againſt him, for I do truſt that in the Fear of God he hath an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered what he intended to anſwer. I ſhall therefore leave his Anſwers, and give ſome Anſwer to another part of the Pamphlet where they ſeem to leave him, and begin to rail on others, as you have their Words in Page 16. where they ſay,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>You may now ſake a taſte of the Doctrins of ſome of his Journey Men the Shoemakers, Joyners, Taylors, Diers,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>which he hath ſent forth to Preach as an Apoſtolical Tribe, for like Number, Preheminence, and what not.</hi> Thus far their own Words. Now let the Reader judge.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Whether what is ſpoken be not in a malicious diſdainful way, and whether it be not like that, <hi>Matth. 13. 55. Is not this the Carpenters Son?</hi> And <hi>Mark 6. 3. Is not this the Carpenter?</hi> I do believe they will find it ſo, when what they boaſt, it ſhall be brought down, and the Lord alone ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:65071:45"/>
it may be by mean Inſtruments, as he was at firſt by Fiſher-men, though the Learned of the Age could not then bear it; But ſure Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians ſhould not follow the <hi>Phariſees</hi> ſteps.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Conſider whether there is not a Blaſphemer's Reflection upon the Twelve Apoſtles of our Lord, in comparing our Number to that Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, ſeeing they have no reaſon for it, there not being ſuch a number of us, only ſome Wicked Perſons were pleaſed to ſay, <hi>There was</hi> Davis <hi>and his Twelve Apoſtles;</hi> but muſt Profeſſors follow their ſteps? I think that Word of Chriſt ſhould ſtop them, <hi>Rev. 2. 9. I know the blaſphemy of them that ſay they are Jews, and are not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Conſider whether they be not guilty of Lying, in ſaying that he ſent them out as an Apoſtolical Tribe.</p>
            <p>But I ſhall now anſwer what followeth concerning my ſelf, who they name by Name, though with many wicked falſe Reflections, which might have been better to have been ſpared than vented by thoſe that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend Chriſtianity, unleſs they think their Tongues are their own, and there is no Lord over them.</p>
            <p>But I bleſs the Lord, who inableth me to rejoice, that I am counted worthy to ſuffer for his Name ſake; for upon diligent Search, I know no reaſon thoſe Men have thus to revile me; for as for my manner of Life, the Lord hath not yet left me to be blamed, for which I bleſs his holy Name, and deſire ſtill to be kept [and whereas they call me <hi>Ape]</hi> I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver yet was left to follow any Man in things wherein I did not conceive they followed Chriſt—but</p>
            <p>Whereas they ſay Mr. <hi>Davis</hi> ſet me up a Paſtor to ſome conceited Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in <hi>Wellingborough—</hi>I anſwer,</p>
            <p>Firſt, It is falſe, for Mr. <hi>Davis</hi> did not ſet me up a Paſtor, for we In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>churched together according to the Rule of the Goſpel, and being In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>churched, I was ſet apart with Faſting and Prayer in the Church, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Primitive Pattern, and Mr. <hi>Davis,</hi> Mr. <hi>Bear,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Greenwood,</hi> all Elders of other Churches, and ſeveral Members of other Churches, were by, as Witneſſes and not Actors; the manner of our act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, I ſhall readily relate more fully to any that deſire it, if it might ſtop the falſe Accuſations of Unreaſonable Men, ſo that by this you may ſee it is a falſe Accuſation.</p>
            <p>2. It is a reproachful Reflection, for I do believe they that be of us fear God, and will one day ſtand at the Right-hand of Chriſt, and then it will be diſmal to be found one that did revile them; Now followeth what they ſaid was my Doctrins, and my Anſwers to them.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That I ſaid, <hi>God's Word doth not tell us how we muſt believe,</hi> and they refer to Head 25. where you may ſee their Revilings, where they ſay, that I ſaid, <hi>If a Revelation of the Spirit will not ſatisfie you, we cannot ſatisfie you.—</hi>I Anſwer,</p>
            <p n="1">1. To the former part, when I firſt heard it, I did declare that I did look upon the holy Scriptures to be the only Rule of Faith and Practice, (and ſo I do ſtill) and I offer'd them to meet any Man to Diſcourſe with him that would ſay that ever I did affirm the contrary; and <hi>Mr. Alen</hi> that was at <hi>Northampton</hi> ſent to them to meet me, but they would
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:65071:45"/>
not, but diſagreed among themſelves, and are now broken by their Wickedneſs: But I am troubled to hear, that they ſhould falſly Charge me<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> their Converſations gave great Ground to ſuſpect that the Word of God is not a Rule to them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That if a Revelation of the Spirit do not ſatisfie, we cannot. I do ſay, That Faith is a Revelation of Chriſt by the Spirit to the Soul, and a Perſuaſion by the ſame Spirit to leave Sin and Self, and truſt in Chriſt ſo revealed. And by this Revelation and Perſuaſion of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, the Soul is ſatisfied, and not by any human Teſtimony without it; <hi>Math. 11. 25. Rom.</hi> 8. 16.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Doctrin, they ſay, I ſaid [God commended that which <hi>Simeon</hi> and <hi>Levi</hi> did, notwithſtanding <hi>Jacob</hi> curſed them]—and that I ſhould make as if God commended by <hi>Judith</hi>'s Mouth what he curſed by <hi>Jacob</hi>'s, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Anſwer,</p>
            <p n="1">1. I never did ſay that God Commended <hi>Simeon</hi> and <hi>Levi</hi>'s Actions, who in their Rage did what they did in breaking in upon the City; only I plead this by way of Alluſion, their taking their Siſter out of the Houſe of <hi>Sechem,</hi> and not dealing with her as with an Harlot; from which I preſſed the Church of Chriſt in <hi>Cambridge-ſhire,</hi> to uſe the Means Chriſt hath appointed in his Goſpel, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. 15, 16, 17. for the recovery of thoſe that had offended. Mr. <hi>Holcraft</hi> and <hi>Harris</hi> were then preſent with the Church, and Mr. <hi>Holcraft</hi> on that day, with the Churches con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent called me to Miniſter the Word among them, in order to my being called to be Paſtor to a part of them; and ſure if there had been ſuch things delivered, they would have diſcerned them, and not ſo far as they did, have ſignified their Approbation: But truly with Grief I write, if the Perſon that drew this Concluſion from my words is ſo filled with Anger, that it appeareth on more accounts than one he careth not what he ſaith; The Lord forgive him.</p>
            <p n="2">2. I never did make uſe of <hi>Judith</hi>'s Name nor Actions, neither did it ever come into my mind; ſo that I am called villanous for that which I never was guilty of; but the Lord humble them for their Evil Speaking.</p>
            <p>Then they ask the Queſtion what I would gather from it, and ſay that my next words tell; <hi>Therefore my Friends buckle on your Swords and fetch your Brethren back from Idolatry;</hi> to which they add many wicked ſcornful Speeches.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> I never did adviſe to this way of fetching back Brethren, for it is againſt my Judgment to uſe it in matters of Religion; indeed I did put them upon Reforming, (and I earneſtly wiſh all in <hi>England</hi> would Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, for I am ſure there is need of it) and I am willing to go with them (tho I go under many Reproaches) for it is Reformation my Soul breatheth after; but I need no Carnal Weapons, but am well ſatisfied, the Sword that goeth out of my Lord's Mouth, will finiſh the Work in his own time; and then ſhall be fulfilled many Scriptures on them that go on in their Scorning.</p>
            <p n="3">3. They ſay I ſaid, <hi>They that die doubting and Fearing, are Damned.</hi> And they charge me with Barbarity.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> I never was ſo barbarous as the Writers would make me, but I had
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:65071:46"/>
and have Bowels for poordoubting dejected Souls, as many can Witneſs, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did I ſay theſe words alone, but this I ſaid, <hi>They that live and die Doubting, and never believe on the Lord Jeſus, are Damned s</hi> And ſo ſaith the Scripture, <hi>Without, are the Fearful and Unbelieving; and he that Believeth not ſhall be Damned.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. They ſay, I ſaid, <hi>Chriſt tore himſelf.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> When I broke the Bread according to Chriſt's Inſtitution (tho they Revile on that account alſo) I did in ſetting forth the love of Chriſt in laying down his own Life for us, ſay thus, <hi>Chriſt gave himſelf;</hi> but preſently added, <hi>That tho there was a Sovereign Act of Chriſt, in laying down his own Life,</hi> according to that Scripture, <hi>John, 10. 15. 17, 18. yet it was the wicked hands of the Jews that Murthered him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>When we find our Hearts moſt wicked, then to Believe in Chriſt, is Pure Faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> I remember not that I ſaid ſo, but if I had, I know not what cauſe any have to be Offended, unleſs it be thoſe that think to make themſelves good before they Believe: <hi>David</hi> would truſt in God, when the Iniquity of his Heels compaſſed him about: And whether ſhould a poor filthy Sinner go, but to the Blood of Chriſt for Cleanſing? but, I find the Accuſers would be acting like <hi>Naaman</hi> the <hi>Syrian,</hi> that thought the Waters of his own Country, better than the Waters of <hi>Jordan:</hi> But <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, (this is a faithful Saying, and worthy of all acceptation) <hi>That Chriſt Jeſus came into the World to ſave Sinners, of whom I am chief,</hi> 1 Tim 1, 15. And if <hi>Chriſt Jeſus</hi> came to ſave the chiefeſt of Sinners, then certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly when I ſee my ſelf the chief of Sinners, and yet Believe in Chriſt, this muſt be pure Faith that looketh through all to Chriſt; and I am ſure, was there more of this Faith, there would be more Holineſs in Heart and Life.</p>
            <p n="6">6. <hi>That there is no uſe of the Law.</hi> This they ſay I ſaid at <hi>Oundle;</hi> but when I ſaid it, or on what account, I know not, neither do the Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers tell me.</p>
            <p>But this I do declare as my Judgment of the Law,</p>
            <list>
               <item>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> That it is Holy, Juſt and Good.</item>
               <item>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> That thoſe that Believe not, are under the Condemnation of it.</item>
               <item>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That it is a Rule of Life to Believers.</item>
            </list>
            <p>But yet this I muſt ſay, it cannot give Life to dead Souls, and therefore not of uſe on that account, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 21.</p>
            <p>Again, there cannot be Righteouſneſs attained by it, on which account a Sinner may be Juſtified, <hi>Gal. 2. 21. For if Righteouſneſs came by the Law, then Chriſt is dead in vain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="7">7. That the 42 of <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 19 ver. is meant of Chriſt, <hi>That Chriſt was Blind and Deaf, and did not know what he ſhould ſuffer when he came into the World.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> I did ſay, That that place ſpake of Chriſt, and I judge ſtill that it doth; but I did not ſay, <hi>That he was Blind and Deaf, and did not know what he ſhould ſuffer when he came into this World:</hi> And pray Reader conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that Verſe, and the 20. 27. with the firſt Verſe, <hi>Behold my Servant:</hi>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:65071:46"/>
And in this 19 Verſe the Lord's Servant: Again he is ſaid to be <hi>Perfect:</hi> And again, there is difference between the 18 Verſe and the 19. The 18 Verſe ſpeaketh of the People of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that were <hi>Deaf and Blind,</hi> and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth upon them in the Plural Number, ſaying, <hi>Hear ye Deaf, and look ye Blind:</hi> But this 19 Verſe ſpeaketh in the Singular Number <hi>My Servant, and he that is Perfect:</hi> Again it is ſaid, <hi>Seeing many things, but thou obſerveſt not, opening the Ears, but he heareth not.</hi> Now, how can this be meant of wilfully Blind <hi>Iſrael,</hi> or their Prieſts? for tho it be granted they were Deaf and Blind themſelves, yet they could not open the Ears of others, therefore I take the Words to be meant of Chriſt; that tho he did foreſee all his Sufferings that he was to paſs through, yet he did not ſo obſerve them as to hinder him in his carrying on our Redemption; tho he did hear the contradiction of Sinners againſt himſelf, yet he ſuffered patiently for them, according to the 38 <hi>Pſalm,</hi> 12, 13, 14 ver. <hi>They all ſeek after my Life,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>But I as a deaf Man hear'd not, and I was as a dumb Man that opened not his Mouth; thus I was as a Man that heareth not, and in whoſe mouth are no Reproofs.</hi> Compare this with <hi>Acts</hi> 8. 32. and 1 Pet. 2. 2.</p>
            <p n="8">8. <hi>That we are Adopted from Eternity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> I did Preach our being <hi>Predeſtinated unto the Adoption of Children by Jeſus Chriſt, according to the Good pleaſure of his Will.</hi> And if any will contend againſt it, let them know, they contend againſt that plain Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 5. For my part I am well ſatisfied that there are a number Choſen in Chriſt their Head, and fore-appointed by the Father to this Relation of Son-ſhip in <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and becauſe they are Sons, he ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth forth the Spirit of his Son, crying <hi>Abba</hi> Father, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 6. And pray let it be conſidered, it is one thing for us to be took into favour by the Father in Chriſt our, Head; and another thing for us to have this kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God manifeſted and help given to us to receive it, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 5. that we might receive the <hi>Adoption of Sons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="9">9. <hi>That People muſt not reſt on Promiſes, and think to renew their Comfort by them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> I did not ſay theſe words ſeparate from others; and if prejudiced People will run away with half Sentences, and be offended, I cannot help it: I have been as wary as I could, notwithſtanding the Unchri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Reflections that the Accuſers caſt upon me. This I have ſaid, <hi>That People muſt not reſt on Promiſes ſeparate from Chriſt;</hi> for tho God hath given to us exceeding great and precious Promiſes, yet thoſe Promiſes are <hi>Yea, and Amen in Chriſt,</hi> 2 Cor. 1. 20.</p>
            <p>So I have ſaid, <hi>They muſt not renew their comfort by the promiſe ſeparate from Chriſt, and that fullneſs of Grace in him that the Promiſe ſpeaks of.</hi> I do ſay, the Word is as it were the Breaſts, but the <hi>Sincere Milk of the Breaſt, is Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> 1 Pet. 2. 2. <hi>As new born Babes deſire the ſincere Milk of the Word.</hi> What this <hi>Milk of the Word is,</hi> you may ſee Verſe 6. wherefore it is contained in the Scripture, <hi>Behold, I lay in Sion a chief Corne-ſtone, Elect, Precious, and he that believeth on him, ſhall not be confounded.</hi> Therefore you muſt renew your Comforts in Chriſt by the Promiſe. And whereas they ſay, Head the 25. <hi>Doth not this make void the Promiſe?</hi> I ſay no, for it bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth you to the Promiſe in it's right Place; but I will return the <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:65071:47"/>
Doth not their way in Arguing for Comfort by the Promiſe ſeparate from Chriſt, make Chriſt of none Effect?</p>
            <p>But if any ask who argueth ſo? I Anſwer, many that I have known, which hath been the cauſe of our thus Preaching; there are many that have great Notions of the Word, and take their Comfort from their Notions, which notwithſtanding reject Chriſt, and count it Preſumption to Believe; and it plainly appeareth by their wicked Carriages and ungodly Reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and hard Speeches againſt the Saints: I ſay, it appeareth that they have not Faith, neither know what it is to Believe, notwithſtanding all their Notions. Thus the <hi>Phariſees</hi> they took Comfort from the Promiſe made to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and they boaſted they were his Seed, and thought to have Eternal Life in the Scriptures: But Chriſt telleth them, <hi>That they would not come to him, that they might have Life.</hi> And here I intreat all that are high in their Notions, to look to it that their Faith in Chriſt be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their Notions concerning him.</p>
            <p>And here alſo I beſeech poor drooping doubting Souls to learn to take hold of Chriſt in the Promiſe, and reſt on him that ſpeaketh <hi>yea,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new your Comforts in him; learn what that meaneth, <hi>Matt. 11. 28. Come unto me all ye that are weary and heavy laden, and I will give you Reſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Laſtly.</hi> They ſpeak of many ſuch Doctrins that I have delivered, but when I know what they are, I ſhall Anſwer them as the Lord ſhall help me: But I hope thoſe that are concerned in writing the Pamphlet, will learn more Wiſdom in their next; and as in this they concealed their Names, as being aſhamed to be known, like Thieves that Diſguiſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves when they have a mind to Rob their near Neighbours; ſo in their next, they conceal their Wickedneſs, leſt that they thought to do to others, be done to themſelves, by the Lord's leaving them to fall under Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches and Shame, according to that Word, <hi>Iſa. 41. 11. Behold, all they that were incenſed againſt thee, ſhall be aſhamed and confounded, they ſhall be as nothing; and they that strive with thee, ſhall Periſh.</hi> Read the next Verſe.</p>
            <p>But I ſhall leave the Pamphlet, with the Writers and Abetters of it, and earneſtly deſire the Reader to Pray for, and endeavour to underſtand the Truth, and comply with it, tho Men and Devils ſtrive againſt it; and I earneſtly deſire thee wherein thou thinkeſt I am out, thou wilt Pray for me, and take the firſt opportunity to deal with me according to the rule of Chriſt, <hi>Matt.</hi> 18. 15. that if I am out, I may be informed, or if I be not out, thy Thoughts may be governed, becauſe wrong informed.</p>
            <p>I ſhall add no more, becauſe I would not make our Anſwers too Bulky, but earneſtly deſire the Prayers of the Godly for me, under all my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches for Chriſt, who do and ſhall Pray for thee and my Enemies.</p>
