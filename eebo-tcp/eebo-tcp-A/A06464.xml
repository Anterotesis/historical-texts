            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

begynne to shewe you my mynde,
in stayinge you for the hole course
of your lyfe, that you may in time
lerne what is to be done, to be a
good &amp; an honest man. You be yet
in the first entree of your lyfe, and
nowe is the tyme to haue a guyde,
that may faithfully conducte you
in the ryght way: For there be so
many by pathes, and for the most
parte, all by pathes be more worne
with the steppes of your fore goers
tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is the very true path of liuing:
that if you go alone, you may par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aduenture

appoynte vnto you certayne mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes,
vppon the whiche if you dily<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gentlye
loke, you canne not erre

man, whose vertue sauoureth ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>santly

and nourisheth hym selfe, with an
incomperable delite and gladnes,
that continually reygneth in his
clene &amp; pure conscie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce. With these
markes &amp; toke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, the which I wold
you loked stil vpon, I wil assigne
you certaine auctors, in whose wor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>kes
I wold you shuld bestow your
lesure, when you may haue time to
rede, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> by them you may at the full
be instructed in al thinges apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teining
to vertu: &amp; in al your life I
wold you medled not greatly with
any other bokes, then with these,
y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I shal name vnto you: it is not
the reding of many bokes,<note place="margin">Reding of many bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes.</note> that get<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>teth
increace of knowlege &amp; iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
for the most parte of them,

their wittes and memorie without
<pb facs="tcp:4548:6"/>
any notable fruite of their redyng.
It muste be a diligent reder, that
shal take the profyte of his labour
and diligence. No man (specially
of them that haue other occupati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons)
can vse redinge but in verye
fewe workes, the whiche I wolde
shuld be piked out of the best sorte:
that the fruite of the reders dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
maye be the greatter. I se
many lose theyr tyme, when they
thinke to bestowe their time beste,
bicause they lacke iudgemente or
knowelege, to pyke oute the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes,
the whiche be worthye to be
studied. And in euerye thynge an
order wel obserued, bringeth more
profitte then any labour or peine
besyde. Wherfore my good Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thipolle,
take hede to my lesson.
I am in doubte, whether you
haue anye other louer, that canne
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:4548:6"/>
and wylle shewe you a lyke tale:
but welle I am assured, that you
haue none, that can thus teache
you with a better will, to haue you
take profite by him, then I do: &amp;
of me howe longe you shall haue
this vse, it is in goddes wil to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termyne:
As moche as lyeth in me,
I wyl nowe procure and prouide,
that these letters shal kepe to your
vse the summe of my councell, by
the whiche if you order your will,
I putte noo doubte, but fyrste the
grace of god shalbe rooted in you,
and next you shal liue with a mery
harte, and finally neuer to lacke
the commodities requisite for the
shorte tyme in this worlde, in the
whiche case you shall opteyne the
worshyp and dignitie of a good &amp;
an honest man, whose conditions
I had rather se you haue with po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerte,
<pb facs="tcp:4548:7"/>
than in greate abundance to
be a man of smal honeste. You may
be good, honest, and ryche, and so
study to be, or els thynke neuer of
ryches: for other wyse you shal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyue
your selfe, &amp; do contrary to y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
way, that as wel worldly wisedom
as the trouth of our faith sheweth
you. But nowe here what I saye.</p>
            <p>¶Fyrst and last (myn owne good
Withipol) reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bre ernestly to haue
in your mind .iii. certeine thinges,
the whiche be of suche valure, that
he that forgetteth eyther their dig<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nitie
and nature, orles the degrees
&amp; order of them: he can not please
nother god, nor hym selfe, nor the
worlde. I saye, in all the course of
your lyfe there be .iii. thinges to be
loked so vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that the first of them
must be firste of you regarded: the
second enext after, and the third in
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:4548:7"/>
his place after the .ii. Beware, as
of dedly poison, that you ruffil not
them without care, one before the
other, as to take the .iii. in the place
of the fyrste, or the second after the
third, or both the second &amp; the third
before the first. In this conclusion
you shal (as I haue sayd) both of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d
god, &amp; displese your selfe, &amp; also
nothinge conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t the world. Like as
the most part of men now a dayes
trespas al for the rechfulnes &amp; ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce
in not keping these .iii. thin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ges,
vnder the dignite &amp; degre ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
as they ought to be obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
and kept. And what be we (my
good Edmo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d) if we be out of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis
fauor? odious to our selfe, and
dispiteful to men. Therfore agayne
I exhort you, to thentent you may
eschewe this abhominable condy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion,
&amp; growe to be admitted in the
<pb facs="tcp:4548:8"/>
blessed nombre of them that rest in
the grace of god, in the clennes of
theyr conscience, and in the fauour
of the world, to be iudged a good,
a wyse, and an honeste man. For
this finall ende myn exhortation
is nowe, that you in al your actes
in the hole course of your lyfe, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membre
these three thinges, that
I wil reherse vnto you. But I say
to you, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> you must not only reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bre
these thre thinges, but also spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
haue in minde the degres of
them: so that euer the first of them
be chiefly in your thoughte aboue
al other: and then in his place put
the second, and let not the third be
regarded, but as his place requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth,
that is, when you haue done
with the fyrste, and also with the
seconde. There lieth more weight
&amp; valure vpon the knowynge and
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:4548:8"/>
kepynge of this tale, that I shall
tell you: then if I coude shewe you
the waye within fewe monethes,

in excedynge abundance of riches,
and also in passynge auctoritie of

that foloweth, if you do after myn
exhortation, as for the infinite hur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tes,
that you canne not escape, if
you shulde forgette that I say: I
warne &amp; warne you agayne, here
this lesson with a glad eare, and
print the same in your mind, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute
with lyuely diligence the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
of this counseyl, wherin is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyned
your life and deathe, your
ioye and sorowe, as welle in this
world, as in that shalbe here after:
These .iii. thinges, be the soule, the
bodye, and the substaunce of this
worlde.<note place="margin">Soule.</note> The fyrst place hath by
<pb facs="tcp:4548:9"/>
good reason the soule, seynge hit
is a thynge immortal, that is cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated
and made after the fygure &amp;
shape of almyghtye god.<note place="margin">Body.</note> The
nexte and seconde rome hath the
bodye, as the caas and sepulture
of the soule, and nereste seruaunt
to the secretis of the spirite. The .iii.
rome occupieth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> riches &amp; goodis
of this world,<note place="margin">Goodes of this worlde.</note> as the necessarie in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strumentes
or toles for the bodye,
the whiche can not want nor lacke
suche thynges. Let then the eie of
your inward minde fyrst &amp; chiefely
euer beholde the first thing in you
that is your soule: Nexte ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
haue a respecte to your bodye:
and thirdely considre the worlde:
Care for your soule, as for your
chiefe iewell and only treasure.</p>
            <p>Care for your body, for the soules
sake. Care for the worlde for the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:4548:9"/>
bodis sake. Beware aboue al thin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ges,
that you go not backewarde,
as he doothe, that carethe fyrste to
be a ryche man: nexte to be an hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thye
manne, and thyrdely to be a
good manne: where he shoulde
do clene contrary, first to study for
goodnes, nexte for helth, and then
for welthe. You se so greate blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
amonge men, that some folke
so careth for ryches, that very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel
they loke for the helth of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dye,
&amp; nothing at al they mind the
state of the soule. I say to you, som
folkes do thus: I wolde to god I
myghte not truely report, that for
the most parte al me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in maner now
a dayes do no nother wyse. Loke
vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> eyther the spiritual sort or the
temporal: and moch a do you shal
hauein the great swarmyng mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
of this blynd sorte, to fynde
<pb facs="tcp:4548:10"/>
oute theym, that fyrste aboue all
thynges care for theyr soule, nexte
for their body: and thirdly for goo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des
of this world. You shal se mar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>chantes
spare no trauayle nor ieo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pardie
of the body, to get these goo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>des.
They be (to sey the trouth) so
occupied in the study of this third
thynge, that scant they haue tyme
to care for the seconde, and as for
the fyrste, they passe nothynge ther
vppon, it semeth a thynge leaste in
theyr thoughte, where, of conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niencye
the same care, studye, and
thought, that they gyue to the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teynynge
of these worldly goodes:
they shulde spend it al in the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teynaunce
of the fyrste thynge,
that is the soule: and the smalle
lyttelle regarde, that they take
for the fyrste, shoulde be bestowed
for the thyrde: and more than they
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:4548:10"/>
do, they shuld cherishe the seconde.
The same co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fusio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is with vs scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers:<note place="margin">scholers.</note>
for our first study is to get pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>motion,
to get these goodis, to liue
welthily. In this care we busely be
occupied continually. Somewhat
more we cheryshe our bodies then
doth the marchant: but our che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rysshynge
is for the longer vse of
these goodes, not as it shuld be for
the soules sake. And as for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> soule
we haue as lyttel regarde as other
men haue, although we speke ther<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>of
more then paraue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ture other me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
do. This ouerthwarte confusion
of these thre thynges marreth all.
And playnely I may say, that all
mischief cometh onely of this mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order,
that we put the chyefe care
of our study to the thyrde thynge,
and not to the fyrste, as of duitye,
we oughte to do the contrarye.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:4548:11"/>
If my purpose were to shewe you,
what other men do, and not rather
what I wolde haue you doo: I
wolde farther procede to expresse
vnto you, how farre out of square
our lyfe is nowe a dayes: and how
blessed a life we shuld haue in this
traunsitorie worlde, if the care of
our soule were fyrst and chiefely in
mens myndes, lyke as the care of
the worldly substa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce occupieth our
hartis aboue all other thinges. If
it were as it ought to be, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> in our
phantasie reigned the study for the
soule, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> shuld be here that celesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
kyngedom, the whiche Christ te<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cheth
vs to pray for in oure pater
noster, where we craue of god, that
his rule and reygne maye come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monge
vs. But as I despayre that
commonly this study and care can
not be changed from these worldly
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:4548:11"/>
ryches to the soule: so I am ful of
good hope, that you wyl take hede
to your lyfe, to ordre therein your
desyres, in this dewe maner, more
regardynge what shulde be done,
then what is done. When you se
and knowe the ryght path, I trust
you wil not walk in the croked hye
way. The trouth shal more drawe
you to loue and to folowe vertue,
then the common ensample shalle
entice you to folowe vyce, the whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
no man can loue, not the syn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
hym selfe.</p>
            <p>But nowe myne owne good Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monde,
here of these three thynges
somewhat more you muste prynte
in your mynde, with a perfect per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
that your soule is the chief
treasure, that you haue: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vppon
your continualle thoughte
and care muste be, to kepe hit, to
<pb facs="tcp:4548:12"/>
defende it, to norishe it, to comfort
it by al waies and meanes possible
for you. In this studie you muste
spende all your wittes: night and
day you must think on this thing,
what so euer you do, you must di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
your act to this thing. If you
be occupied in the state of your bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
eyther to dryue away syckenes,
or to susteyne helth, let it be for the
seruice your bodi oweth to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> soule.
If you trauayle for goodes of this
worlde, to get your owne lyuyng,
or to helpe your frende, orels to pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uide
for your chyldren, when god
shal sende you them: let your tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uayle
be for the necessyties of the
body, and so finally for the soule.
Consydre what the goodes of the
worlde be, howe they be but instru<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mentes
for the body. Use then the
worlde in his kynde. Loke agayne
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:4548:12"/>
vpon your body, howe it is preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouser
then the goodes: vse hym the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
in his worthynes, &amp; hurte not your
body for a thing of lesse valu. And
as ye haue nothinge, nother your
body nor your goodes, to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
with the dignite of your soule:
so my swete withipol, let nothinge
be in your reputation aboue this
chief &amp; principal iewel, the whiche
must only for him self be cared for,
&amp; al other thinges in this life, must
be cherished for it. I sticke moche
with you in repetinge one thynge,
but maruayle nat, though I so do:
For I se vs al in this world so blin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ded,
partly by a vse &amp; custome fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
cradil, in the magnifienge of these
goodis, partli by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple of them,
with whom we be daily conuersa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t:
that scant after longe crieng it can
nowe be harde, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the soule must be
<pb facs="tcp:4548:13"/>
cheifly cared for. And except grace
worke with you, that you your self
wyll consent to the trouth, it is not
possible to perswade you, that the
very trewe way of lyuyng is this,
to care chiefly for the soule, and to
care for all other thynges onelye
for the soules sake. This sayenge
thoughe it be trewe, yet I saye, hit
can not be harde: in as moche the
lyues of all them, with whome ye
shalbe continuallye conuersaunt,
shall crye oute clene contrarye a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynste
my sayeng. For on al sides
you shall se menne sweatynge in a
contynuall worke, bothe of bodye
and of mynde, to get these world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
goodes, withoute any mention
made of the soules state: the whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
the verye friers care lyttel for:
as it openly appereth. But euer
I say to you, loke what Christen
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:4548:13"/>
men shuld do, and if you se men so
do, be glad of that syght, &amp; folowe
the same: if you se the contrarie, fle
from the ensample, and cleue euer
fastly to the trouthe, with a sorow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
harte for the losse of other men,
that so blyndely rushe forthe in the
trayne of a vicious lyuyng, where
the soule is so lyttel cared fore.</p>
            <p>¶That this firste thynge may be
y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> better in your study, I wil brefe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
touche som what of tho thynges
that appertein hereto: to haue you
knowe what nourisheth and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forteth
the soule, &amp; what hurteth
and noyeth the same. The soule
can not but euer lyue, it hath noo
ende of lyuynge, yet we may saye,
that the soule liueth and dyeth: It
liueth in the grace of god, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
in the malice of the diuel. The
soules lyfe is the lyghte of vertue:
<pb facs="tcp:4548:14"/>
his death is the derkenes of sinne.
You haue a free wyll gyuen you,
wherby you may either quicken or
slaye at your owne pleasure, your
soule in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bryght Paradise of life,
and you may set your soule in the
blacke dungeon of deathe. Let
therefore this wyll of yours euer
study to procure for the soules life,
the whiche is your owne lyfe: and
in the same study you shall delyuer
the soule from his death, the whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
is the perpetualle payne ordei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
for synne, that seperateth the
image of god frome his patrone.
I saye syn plucketh your soule fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
god, whose image your soule shuld
beare. Therfore in all your actis
so doo, that you wyllyngely dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>please
not god: who canne not be
pleased but with a pure and clene
conscience, pure and cleane if you
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:4548:14"/>
suffre noo synne to remaygne soo
longe in your desyre and mynde,
that hit cankerethe the thoughte.
Your thoughte is cankered with
the longe resydence of synne: when
eyther you be weake in the studye
of vertue, orelles make verye lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telle
of a faulte, or defende youre
vyce, or nowselle youre selfe in a
custome of an inordynate desyre.
The fraylenes of our flesshe is so
greatte, that it canne not be, but
that syn shall come to our desyre:
but it is our blame, if synne tarye
and abyde within vs. God hath
gyuen vs a myghtye power ouer
our selfe: we maye when we wyll
correcte our desires, and dryue out
all synne. If you knowe not what
is synne, nor what is vertue: by
the feare and loue of god, you shal
knowe boothe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:4548:15"/>
The feare of god wylle teache you
to flee sinne and folowe vertu.<note place="margin">Feare of god. Loue of god.</note> The
loue of god wylle teache you to fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe
vertu and flee sinne: wherby
your priuey and secrete conscience
shall better and more clerely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue,
what is to be done, and what
is not, than any diffinition or des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cryption
can appoynt oute to you.
Therfore my dere Withipoll, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warpe
your selfe faste and sure in
the fere and loue of god, from your
firste rysynge to your reste, drawe
forth the day in all your busynesse,
as this louynge feare and feareful
loue shal secretely admonishe and
warne you: and dye rather than
you wolde pursue any lust against
your knowlege of goddes plesure.</p>
            <p>¶What marchandise so euer you
occupie: remembre, it is the busy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
of the thirde care, for the whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:4548:15"/>
you may not leaue any poynte
of this fyrste care, that belongeth
to the soule. Lyke wise if ye be oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupied
about the body: remembre,
it is the warke of the seconde care,
the which also must be ordered vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>der
the fyrste, the whiche fyrst must
alwey sticke in your mynde, stur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
vp and led in all desires &amp; ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites
by the sayde feare &amp; loue of
god. Do neuer that thynge, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
you feare goddis displeasure.</p>
            <p>¶More partycularlye in wry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinges
you shall lerne this lesson,<note place="margin">Newe te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stamente.</note>
if you wold somtyme take in your
handes the newe testamente, and
rede it with a dewe reuerence. For
I wold not haue you in that boke
forgette, with whome you talke,
hit is god that there speakethe,
hit is you a poore creature of god
that redeth. Consider the matche,
<pb facs="tcp:4548:16"/>
and meke downe your wittes. Pre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sume
not in no case to thynke, that
there you vnderstonde ought: leue
deuisinge thervpon: submit your
selfe to the expositio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of holy doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours:
and euer conforme your co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
to agre with Christes church.
This is the surest way that you ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
take, both before god &amp; man. Your
obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce to the vniuersal faith shal
excuse you before god, although it
might be in a false belefe: &amp; y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same
obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce shal also kepe you out of
trouble in this worlde, where you
se, howe folishe medlars be daylie
sore punyshed, both to theyr owne
vndoing, &amp; also to their gret sorow
&amp; lamenting of their louers &amp; fren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des.
Surely the trouthe is as I
haue sayd, that it is your parte to
obey, and to folowe the church: so
that both for your soules sake, and
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:4548:16"/>
for your bodily quietnes, with the
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>forte of your frendes, I exhorte
you to meddel in no point of your

shall growe in to a highe corage
to ryse in a iudgemente aboue the

in a hill of highe contemplacion:
from whence you shal loke downe
and dispise the vanite, that folishe
men take, in the deceyteful pompe
of this shorte &amp; wretched life. Mo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bokes,
I wyll not aduyse you, for

these: excepte hit be Enchiridion,

For I knowe what pleasure you

            <p>¶The second care is for the body,
the which you must cherish as mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
as may stande with the seruice
of your former thought and study
for your chief treasure. Haue a res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specte

&amp; specially in Seneca,<note place="margin">Seneca.</note> you
shal finde many lessons, that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perteine
to the thirde care. This
third care is for the goodes in this
world. In this part I can giue you
smal aduyse of my selfe, bycause I
haue had but smal experience here
in: yet euer I se, that you may not
in the study of gettyng these goo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,
leue or slake the chief care, for
the fyrste thynge, nor yet the seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>darye
care for the bodye. Labour
you muste for your lyuynge in a
dewe order, as in the thyrd degree
<pb facs="tcp:4548:20"/>
of your thinges. If matens, masse,
or a sermon be to be harde, set your
marcha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dise aparte for the season,
&amp; prefer the mattens of your soule,
y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> loketh to haue suche gostly fode.
If the tyme require to haue you
take a mele, eyther a diner or a sup<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>per
for your refection, let not your
marcha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dise defer the going therto
in a dewe tyme. For reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bre, that
busines is one degree aboue your

man to be in nede of your helpe,
hast to helpe him befor any eare of
makinge a bargayne, for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> worke
of mercy perteyneth to your chiefe

growe in the grace of god. Breke
not moch, to the hurt of your helth
the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uenient time of going to bed
for any occupatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s or rekeninges

ꝓpmise, with false deceite &amp; vntrue

whom resteth your chief thought.
And by falshed, you coulde not get
so moch of riches, as by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same you
shuld lose of honestie &amp; goodnes.
wherfore trauayle euer as the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gres
of these .iii. thinges shal req<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>re.
If an infinite hepe of worldly goo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>des
might be got with a smal hurte
&amp; damage of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> soule, forsake rather
<pb facs="tcp:4548:21"/>
that great heape, than you wolde
suffre this small hurte. There can
be no comparison betwene the sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les
helth and the riches: the leaste
droppe that can be of your soules
parte, must pondre and weye more
in your thought, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> al this world
besyde can do.</p>
            <p>¶Let not any similitude<note place="margin">Similitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des.</note> deceyue
your indgement. As if par cas a
man wolde reson, that the goodes
of the soule be all golde, the goo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des
of the worlde be all leade: all
thoughe that golde is euer better
than lede, yet there may be a great

aboue the smalle portion of golde.
So in your phantasy a great gai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
&amp; lucre of the worldly goodes
may seme better than a smal point
of our soules substaunce. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
he wyll conclude, that with a

lyttel losse of honestie or goodnes,
we maye venture to gette a greate
aduauntage in this worlde: and
some littel small portion we maye
borowe of our soule, to wynne by
that meanes a great summe of ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.
Beware good withipoll, of
suche reasonnyng, and to the deth,
to gayne al the hole royalte of this
hole worlde, neuer trespas against
your soule in the smallest iote that
can be imagined. As if ye might
be made a lorde of greate myght &amp;
power with abundance of posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions

sake you all that offer, rather then
you wolde fele the priuey bytte of
your offence. For if you loke well,
you shal see, that there is a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb facs="tcp:4548:22"/>

not like betwene the soules goodis
&amp; the goodes of this world, as it is
betwene golde and lead valured a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>boue
a peny weight of gold: where
there is no title so small of vertue,
that is not to be valured without
comparison aboue the hole power
of the erth and sees, throughe out
Asia, Affrica, and Europa. The
profe of my saieng dependeth here
vpon, that euery iote, euery title, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery

y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> soules welthie state, hath

<pb n="22" facs="tcp:4548:22"/>
the spiritual goodes, both small &amp;

receiueth hir rewarde: Of the

y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> reineth ouer al them, as ouer

finde in their hartes to forsake ver<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tue
to wynne these false and vaine

stede: but for the shorte tyme
of a fewe yeres in this life, where y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
possessio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of vertu be euerlasting.
Thus I shewe you good Edmo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d,
that your care to get these worldly
goodes muste be subdued vnder
due order, as in his thyrde place.
But what be these goodes, &amp; what
wey you may laufully gette them,
I doubte not, but your father wyll
<pb facs="tcp:4548:23"/>
in tyme conuenint shewe you. He
is of that sorte of men, the whiche
hath by longe approued honestie
purchased hym a good name, and
is therby beloued and regarded of
good men: whose steppes if you
folowe, you shal by goddes grace
come to lyke worshyppe, and be of
lyke or more habilitie to leaue to
your childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> sufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to passe this
lyfe with. Here reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bre, the more
your father loueth you, the lesse is
your thirde care: and the lesse that
your thirde care is, the more leiser
you haue to think vpon your chief
iewell, the whiche god hath gyuen
you to be ordered after your wyll,
in the whiche iewel you shall after
this lyfe well passed, haue the fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ition
of goddis presence, wherein
resteth the ioye ineffable of the bles<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sed
lammes. The gotis, that is to
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:4548:23"/>
say, the gredie soules of this third
care, the which neuer mendeth, or
very lyttel and weakely mendeth,
the fyrste care, shal remayne for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
more, in the peineful darknes,
where is nothynge but cryeng out
and lamentynge with frettyng of
stomakes, and snarrynge of teth,
as the gospell shall teache you: In
the whiche boke of god, you shall
here what an harde thyng it is for
a ryche man to entre in to heuen:
bicause that most commonly riche
men spend al theyr care &amp; thought
out of order, onely for this worlde,
and seldome or neuer they thinke
of theyr soule: and whenne they
thynke thereof, they soo thynke,
that they put that care far vnder
the care of these worldely busines,
doynge clene contrarye to this or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.
The whiche god wolde haue
<pb facs="tcp:4548:24"/>
vs to kepe. The which order thouh
you shal se very litel regarded of al

Enforce your selfe to be amonge

not drawe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to an yuel opinion, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

You may by your self know, what
is the right path, folowe you cora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giously

this .iii. care, I wyll shew you my
mind, what is chiefly in this ꝑte to
be cared fore: as the best portion of
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:4548:24"/>
worldely ryches. Surely I reken
no possession of londes, nor yet no
substa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of marcha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dise, nor yet no
abu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dance of money, to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to a good fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d.<note place="margin">A good frende.</note> Therfore aboue
all things in this worlde, procure
to haue ple<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tie of fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des, &amp; make of
them your co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pte, as of your best &amp;
most p<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cious goodes. Alweys your
frende shall be more profitable to
you, then any tresure or power be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side
can be. Nowe you shall know
them y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> be worthy to be your fren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis,
&amp; by what menes, &amp; what wey

to opteyne substance of goodes, it

And the very trouth is, that there

Wherfore I can not warne you

Let no displesure be taken of you,

            <p>¶Thus I say both for the world<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly
wisedome, and also for the bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des
of your faythe, you muste take
hede to this warnynge: &amp; the more

plucke you your soule fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence

Also you disquiete your body, and

            <p>One other thynge or two I wolde

with your selfe to amend them: if
they be not in you, &amp; be good, deter<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>myne
with your selfe to get them.

This thing chiefly apꝑteineth to
the care of the soule, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is your first
charge. It maketh also for the .ii.
and for the .iii. care. For surely whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
the minde is disquieted with the re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>membraunce
<pb facs="tcp:4548:34"/>
of the offence in ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enge,
the body hath his parte of yl

y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> seke by marcha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dise any lucre or

my good Withipol neuer delite to
vtter any lie. Eyther speke not, or
speke truly. what faute so euer you
may do, let it not be defe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded with a

smoke in to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fire, as to do a worse
faute in choking an yll, and in the
mene season your soule suffereth a
sore stroke. This euer as you rede
of this matter, haue minde of your
selfe to take fruit of your redynge.</p>
            <p>¶In consideration also of al thre
partes, that is to say, both for the
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:4548:34"/>
defence of your soules state, &amp; for
the welth of your bodye, and also
for the worldly goodes sake, vse in

wisedome, neuer to be none
of these busy medlers: Leue other
mens fautes, leue correcting, that

of that you knowe not. Let
the gospel be ordered by them, that
be admitted for doctours therof.</p>
            <p>Let the prestes be blamed of them
that haue the rule of the order. Let
common ceremonies and all olde
customes alone. Put euer your
trust in the power and wyl of god,
and obey to he consent of the chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che,
without quarellynge or resys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tynge.
Go you fourth your waye
after the meke steppes of a trewe
christen man. Let the worlde blu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
and blowe as hit wyll, be you

none of the blowers. Scurge who
wyl, be you none of the scourgers.
For beleue me, sooner shal the rod,
than the chylde y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is beaten, be cast
in to the fier. In eschewinge all
medlyng, you shal saue your goo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,
you shal kepe your body from

you shal best prouide a sure bucke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler

ouerfloweth this world.
If you shoulde be malaperte,<note place="margin">malapert.</note> and
presume to be a doer: reporte me to

to your vndoing both in goo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des

you shalbe caste from the succour

You falle in to presumption,<note place="margin">presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note>
when you grudge agaynste your

all disprayses. You presume, when
you meddel with them, that be not

you take in hande to amende this
or that, where your parte is not to

when you dare crake,
that you knowe goddes wil. Leue
therfore my good Edmond, al ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner

also bitterly, that his wyll may be

            <p>Thus pray, and meddille no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
For I assure you, it is so to
be done.</p>
            <p>¶Many my thynges myghte be
<pb facs="tcp:4548:36"/>
sayd for these .iii. cares, but to you
I recken it inough this moch that
I haue here touched. yet one word
or .ii. more shall not be suꝑfluous.
For I wolde not haue you decey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
by any word that I haue here
vsed: As perauenture you might
be, if I shuld thus leaue you. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inge
that I haue bed you fyrste to
care for your soule, next to care for
your body, and thyrdely to care for
the goodes of this worlde. More<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ouer
I sayd, there be goodes of the
soule, goodes of the body, goodes
of this lyfe. But lette these wordes
be to you as not spoken in their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acte
and propre signification. For
to speake truely, there is noo care
but one, nor there be noo goodes
but of one. We muste haue a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne
slyght regarde to our body,
&amp; a slighter regarde to the worlde:
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:4548:36"/>
but care we may not for neither of
these two. You knowe, that to care
were to take an inwarde weyghty
thought: the whiche muste not be
taken, but for a thynge of greate
worthynes, and also of more sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
than is either our body, or the
worlde. Only our soule is the thi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g
to be cared fore: and these smal co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities,
with certayn praty plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
of the body, and the worlde,
can not truelye be named goodes:
for in very dede they be not good.
For this worde good includethe a
dignitie in hym that sauoureth of
god and heuen: So that tho thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
be onely worthye to be called
goodes, the which haue a ꝑpetui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
and stedfastnesse of godly sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staunce:
Other thinges variable,
chaungable, flytterynge, suche as
maye be taken from vs mawgree
<pb facs="tcp:4548:37"/>
our heed, be not worthye of this
hyghe name. Neyther the bodye
nor yet fortune hath any goodes:
our spirite &amp; mynde only hath thin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ges,
that truly be called goodes, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
whiche be so constantly and surely
ours, that euer they remayne with
vs in spite of all chaunces, and all

mekenes, sobrenes, paci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
faythefulnes, charitie, and
such other vertues be the very tru
goodes, the which we may iustely
reken ours, &amp; for them we shulde
continually labour. For these be
the substaunce that our soule must
haue, to be with them rychely dec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
and garnished, that we maye
haue our holy day array, and our

we shall ones be called to.</p>

All these vayne thynges, bothe of

This sayenge good Wy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thipolle,

that is trewe, you nowe lerne, that
al though before I sayd you shuld
haue thre cares in this lyfe, yet in
<pb facs="tcp:4548:38"/>
dede you haue but one care, the
whiche is to care for the true goo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,
that be to be purchased for the
soules welthy state. Wherfore of
your three cares, stryke of two, if
you wyll speake of ernest care. Yet
I wyl sticke a lytle more with you
in this poynte: for fayne I wolde
you shulde se a true marke, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
you may gouerne and rule all
your phantasies and opinions. If
your phantasie be well directed to
the true marke, you ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not misse of
the ryght pathe to vertue, the whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
bryngeth man thither, where
he shall receiue the inestimable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde
for his trauayle. I say your
soule onely must be cared for: and
this onely care must be to get and
kepe the true goodes, that be only
the goodes of the mynde: Other
goodes be not called proprely goo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>des.
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:4548:38"/>
you se howe these praty com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities
of the bodye, &amp; also these

ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not escape alway sykenes, I ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
not escape misfortunes: I can not
flee frome the cruel handes of ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes,
I may be cast into tortures,
I may rotte in fetters, I may lose
al my substance, by water, by fyer,
by theues, or by other violent rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berye.
Agaynst these chances no
man ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> resist, no care nor thought
preuayleth to assure vs, eyther of
our bodyes or of suche goodes.</p>
            <p>Wherfore lerne you, that I say be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore

and marke myn Edmonde, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
you maye be hurted, that your

            <p>For to care wher you haue no hurt
it is nedeles: or not to care, where

            <p>¶We be hurted wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we lose any

whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we decay not in the stre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gthis

neyther with the gladnes of

nor with bewaylynge of theyr ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersite.
Thus you se, nother in the

            <p>¶Now whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you knowe the place
of your hurte, knowe also what
may do you hurte, that you maye
be more charie of your hurter.</p>
            <p>You se ones, the place wherin you
maye be hurted, is your secrete
mynde, a very sure place. For it
is not fyre nor water: nor thefe
that can come there: it is no prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis
sworde, that ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> perce into this
<pb facs="tcp:4548:40"/>
place it is no misslucke of fortune
that can lyght vpon your spirite:
finally there is no diuel of hel, that
can fasten a stroke vpon you, to do
you in this place any hurte. This
shulde be a greatter gladnes vnto
you to considre, in howe stronge a
tower you be from all hurte: but
se thenne agayne, who hit is that
maye hurte you. For surelye you
ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not be hurted but of one, in who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
is power to do hurte: this is your
owne free wyl. This wyl of yours
&amp; nothing els, hath power to hurt
you. Se shortely in ensa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple, howe
your la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des be take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you, you be
spoyled of your goodes, fire bur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>neth
vp your house, you be haled
to priso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, you be beate<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, you be torne
with whips, you be drawe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vpon y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
rackes, you lie in chaynes, you co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e
forth to ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> shame, you suffre cold,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:4548:40"/>
you be gnawen with hunger and
thyrste, finallye you be putte to
death. what of al this? yet I can
not saye, that you be hurted: I se
that with al this the fauor &amp; grace
of good may co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinue with you, as
it did with the holy martyrs. And
also before Christis passion holye
Iob suffred al this, &amp; was not hur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ted.
This is a great co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort for you,
to se that nothing ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hurt you but
only your owne selfe. This is the
hyghe grace of god, that so hathe
made man to be ouer al a myghty
conquerour, that can take no hurt
but of hym selfe. Wherfore I trust
you will lyue euer safe and sownd.
For I wyll not thynke, that euer
you wil be so mad, as to hurt your
selfe. Than for these trifles of the
body and worlde, take no care: it
it is neyther the seconde thyng nor
<pb facs="tcp:4548:41"/>
the thirde thynge, that canne be so
vnto you, that in eyther of theym
you can de hurted. Marie take
hede, lest by the displeasures done
in the second and in the thyrd, you
of madnes take occasion to be hur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ted,
and wyllyngelye hurte your
selfe in the fyrste thinge, the which
onely is the place, where you may
be hurted. And none besyde your
owne wyl hath power to hurt you
there: as if in the tyme of the losse
of worldly goodes, you wil fret in
anger, you wil dispise god, you wil
curse and ban, you wyl enforce to
be aue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ged, you crye out in furie &amp;
madnes: now take you thought &amp;
care, for surely you be hurted, and
your chief iewel hath a great losse.
For god withdraweth from your
soule a great part of his grace: so
that this hurt you do to your own
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:4548:41"/>
selfe by this frowardenes. Lyke<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>wyse
whylste your body is turme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
eyther with sykenes or other<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>wise:
if you therfor forsake pacie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce,
and swelle in wrothe: you be than
hurted in dede, but of noone other
person besyde your selfe onely.</p>
            <p>Thus you may take fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d
and the thyrde, in the whiche two
you can not be hurted, an occasion
to hurte your selfe, &amp; to haue ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
a greatte cause of a sore and an
erneste care, for the peril that your
soule therby falleth in.</p>
            <p>¶To confirme you the faster in
these ryghte opinions, I wolde
you redde the lyttell boke of Epic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tetus,<note place="margin">Epicteꝰ.</note>
intitled his Enchiridion,
well translated into latyne by An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelus
Politiane: But to saye
the trouth the worke is so briefely
and darkely written, that without
<pb facs="tcp:4548:42"/>
a coment or a good mayster, you
shall not perceyue the fruite of the
texte. I am in mynde, if I maye
haue therto leysure, to translate
the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ment of Simplicius vppon
the sayd worke: and then shal you
finde suche swetenes in that boke,
that I beleue hit will rauishe you
in to an hygher contemplation,
than a greatte sorte of our religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
men come to. And one thinge
beleue me, my good withipol, that
in redynge of these olde substanci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
workes, the whiche I haue na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
vnto you, shal besyde the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
of knowlege, gender a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne
iudgement in you, that you
shal neuer take delite nor pleasure
in the trifles and vayne inuenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
that men nowe daies write, to
the inquietinge of all good order:
by reason that the moste parte of
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:4548:42"/>
men that rede these new flittering
workes, lacke perfecte iudgement
to dyscryue a weyghtye sentence
fro me a lyghte clause, the whiche
iudgemente can not be gotten, but
by a longe exercysynge of our wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes
with the best sorte of writers.</p>
            <p>And to me it is a pitiful thynge, to
beholde the folishe dremes of these
yonge clerkes in mens handes: &amp;
to se these noble olde workes of the
holy fathers and philosophers lye
vntouched. Where if these newe
wryters speke any thynge well, it
is piked out of this aunciente bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes.
But what so euer these petye
clarkes pike out nowe a dayes, for
the mooste parte it is defaced and
broughte out of good fashio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with
theyr yuel handelynge.</p>
            <p>¶I wyl nowe make an ende, it is
