            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

begynne to shewe you my mynde,
in stayinge you for the hole course
of your lyfe, that you may in time
lerne what is to be done, to be a
good &amp; an honest man. You be yet
in the first entree of your lyfe, and
nowe is the tyme to haue a guyde,
that may faithfully conducte you
in the ryght way: For there be so
many by pathes, and for the most
parte, all by pathes be more worne
with the steppes of your fore goers
tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> is the very true path of liuing:
that if you go alone, you may par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aduenture

vppon the whiche if you dily<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gentlye
loke, you canne not erre

man, whose vertue sauoureth ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>santly

and nourisheth hym selfe, with an
incomperable delite and gladnes,
that continually reygneth in his
clene &amp; pure conscie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>ce. With these
markes &amp; toke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>s, the which I wold

you certaine auctors, in whose wor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>kes
I wold you shuld bestow your
lesure, when you may haue time to
rede, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> by them you may at the full
be instructed in al thinges apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teining
to vertu: &amp; in al your life I
wold you medled not greatly with
any other bokes, then with these,
y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I shal name vnto you: it is not
the reding of many bokes,<note place="margin">Reding of many bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes.</note> that get<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>teth
increace of knowlege &amp; iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:

their wittes and memorie without
<pb facs="tcp:4548:6"/>
any notable fruite of their redyng.
It muste be a diligent reder, that
shal take the profyte of his labour
and diligence. No man (specially
of them that haue other occupati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons)
can vse redinge but in verye
fewe workes, the whiche I wolde
shuld be piked out of the best sorte:
that the fruite of the reders dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
maye be the greatter. I se
many lose theyr tyme, when they
thinke to bestowe their time beste,
bicause they lacke iudgemente or
knowelege, to pyke oute the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes,
the whiche be worthye to be
studied. And in euerye thynge an
order wel obserued, bringeth more
profitte then any labour or peine
besyde. Wherfore my good Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thipolle,
take hede to my lesson.
I am in doubte, whether you
haue anye other louer, that canne

and wylle shewe you a lyke tale:
but welle I am assured, that you
haue none, that can thus teache
you with a better will, to haue you
take profite by him, then I do: &amp;
of me howe longe you shall haue
this vse, it is in goddes wil to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termyne:
As moche as lyeth in me,
I wyl nowe procure and prouide,
that these letters shal kepe to your
vse the summe of my councell, by
the whiche if you order your will,
I putte noo doubte, but fyrste the
grace of god shalbe rooted in you,
and next you shal liue with a mery
harte, and finally neuer to lacke
the commodities requisite for the
shorte tyme in this worlde, in the
whiche case you shall opteyne the
worshyp and dignitie of a good &amp;
an honest man, whose conditions
I had rather se you haue with po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerte,
<pb facs="tcp:4548:7"/>
than in greate abundance to
be a man of smal honeste. You may
be good, honest, and ryche, and so
study to be, or els thynke neuer of
ryches: for other wyse you shal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyue
your selfe, &amp; do contrary to y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
way, that as wel worldly wisedom
as the trouth of our faith sheweth
you. But nowe here what I saye.</p>
            <p>¬∂Fyrst and last (myn owne good
Withipol) reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>bre ernestly to haue
in your mind .iii. certeine thinges,
the whiche be of suche valure, that
he that forgetteth eyther their dig<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nitie
and nature, orles the degrees
&amp; order of them: he can not please
nother god, nor hym selfe, nor the
worlde. I saye, in all the course of
your lyfe there be .iii. thinges to be
loked so vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>, that the first of them
must be firste of you regarded: the
second enext after, and the third in
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:4548:7"/>
his place after the .ii. Beware, as
of dedly poison, that you ruffil not
them without care, one before the
other, as to take the .iii. in the place
of the fyrste, or the second after the
third, or both the second &amp; the third
before the first. In this conclusion
you shal (as I haue sayd) both of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>d
god, &amp; displese your selfe, &amp; also
nothinge conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>t the world. Like as
the most part of men now a dayes
trespas al for the rechfulnes &amp; ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>ce
in not keping these .iii. thin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ges,
vnder the dignite &amp; degre ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
as they ought to be obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
and kept. And what be we (my
good Edmo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>d) if we be out of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis
fauor? odious to our selfe, and
dispiteful to men. Therfore agayne
I exhort you, to thentent you may
eschewe this abhominable condy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion,
&amp; growe to be admitted in the
<pb facs="tcp:4548:8"/>
blessed nombre of them that rest in
the grace of god, in the clennes of
theyr conscience, and in the fauour
of the world, to be iudged a good,
a wyse, and an honeste man. For
this finall ende myn exhortation
is nowe, that you in al your actes
in the hole course of your lyfe, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membre
these three thinges, that
I wil reherse vnto you. But I say
to you, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> you must not only reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bre
these thre thinges, but also spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
haue in minde the degres of
them: so that euer the first of them
be chiefly in your thoughte aboue
al other: and then in his place put
the second, and let not the third be
regarded, but as his place requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth,
that is, when you haue done
with the fyrste, and also with the
seconde. There lieth more weight
&amp; valure vpon the knowynge and
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:4548:8"/>
kepynge of this tale, that I shall

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyned
your life and deathe, your

These .iii. thinges, be the soule, the
bodye, and the substaunce of this
worlde.<note place="margin">Soule.</note> The fyrst place hath by
<pb facs="tcp:4548:9"/>
good reason the soule, seynge hit
is a thynge immortal, that is cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated
and made after the fygure &amp;
shape of almyghtye god.<note place="margin">Body.</note> The

of this world,<note place="margin">Goodes of this worlde.</note> as the necessarie in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strumentes
or toles for the bodye,
the whiche can not want nor lacke
suche thynges. Let then the eie of
your inward minde fyrst &amp; chiefely
euer beholde the first thing in you
that is your soule: Nexte ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
haue a respecte to your bodye:
and thirdely considre the worlde:
Care for your soule, as for your
chiefe iewell and only treasure.</p>
            <p>Care for your body, for the soules
sake. Care for the worlde for the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:4548:9"/>
bodis sake. Beware aboue al thin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ges,
that you go not backewarde,
as he doothe, that carethe fyrste to
be a ryche man: nexte to be an hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thye
manne, and thyrdely to be a
good manne: where he shoulde
do clene contrary, first to study for
goodnes, nexte for helth, and then
for welthe. You se so greate blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
amonge men, that some folke
so careth for ryches, that very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel
they loke for the helth of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dye,
&amp; nothing at al they mind the
state of the soule. I say to you, som
folkes do thus: I wolde to god I
myghte not truely report, that for
the most parte al me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> in maner now
a dayes do no nother wyse. Loke
vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> eyther the spiritual sort or the

of this blynd sorte, to fynde
<pb facs="tcp:4548:10"/>
oute theym, that fyrste aboue all
thynges care for theyr soule, nexte
for their body: and thirdly for goo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des
of this world. You shal se mar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>chantes
spare no trauayle nor ieo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pardie
of the body, to get these goo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>des.
They be (to sey the trouth) so
occupied in the study of this third
thynge, that scant they haue tyme
to care for the seconde, and as for
the fyrste, they passe nothynge ther
vppon, it semeth a thynge leaste in
theyr thoughte, where, of conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niencye
the same care, studye, and
thought, that they gyue to the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teynynge
of these worldly goodes:
they shulde spend it al in the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teynaunce
of the fyrste thynge,
that is the soule: and the smalle
lyttelle regarde, that they take
for the fyrste, shoulde be bestowed
for the thyrde: and more than they
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:4548:10"/>
do, they shuld cherishe the seconde.
The same co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>fusio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> is with vs scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers:<note place="margin">scholers.</note>
for our first study is to get pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>motion,
to get these goodis, to liue
welthily. In this care we busely be
occupied continually. Somewhat
more we cheryshe our bodies then
doth the marchant: but our che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rysshynge
is for the longer vse of
these goodes, not as it shuld be for
the soules sake. And as for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> soule
we haue as lyttel regarde as other
men haue, although we speke ther<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>of
more then paraue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>ture other me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>
do. This ouerthwarte confusion
of these thre thynges marreth all.
And playnely I may say, that all
mischief cometh onely of this mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order,
that we put the chyefe care
of our study to the thyrde thynge,
and not to the fyrste, as of duitye,
we oughte to do the contrarye.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:4548:11"/>
If my purpose were to shewe you,
what other men do, and not rather
what I wolde haue you doo: I
wolde farther procede to expresse
vnto you, how farre out of square
our lyfe is nowe a dayes: and how
blessed a life we shuld haue in this
traunsitorie worlde, if the care of
our soule were fyrst and chiefely in
mens myndes, lyke as the care of
the worldly substa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>ce occupieth our
hartis aboue all other thinges. If
it were as it ought to be, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> in our
phantasie reigned the study for the
soule, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> shuld be here that celesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
kyngedom, the whiche Christ te<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cheth
vs to pray for in oure pater
noster, where we craue of god, that
his rule and reygne maye come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monge
vs. But as I despayre that
commonly this study and care can
not be changed from these worldly
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:4548:11"/>
ryches to the soule: so I am ful of
good hope, that you wyl take hede
to your lyfe, to ordre therein your
desyres, in this dewe maner, more
regardynge what shulde be done,
then what is done. When you se
and knowe the ryght path, I trust
you wil not walk in the croked hye
way. The trouth shal more drawe
you to loue and to folowe vertue,
then the common ensample shalle
entice you to folowe vyce, the whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
no man can loue, not the syn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
hym selfe.</p>
            <p>But nowe myne owne good Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monde,
here of these three thynges
somewhat more you muste prynte
in your mynde, with a perfect per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>,
that your soule is the chief
treasure, that you haue: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vppon
your continualle thoughte
and care muste be, to kepe hit, to
<pb facs="tcp:4548:12"/>
defende it, to norishe it, to comfort
it by al waies and meanes possible
for you. In this studie you muste
spende all your wittes: night and
day you must think on this thing,
what so euer you do, you must di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
your act to this thing. If you
be occupied in the state of your bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
eyther to dryue away syckenes,
or to susteyne helth, let it be for the
seruice your bodi oweth to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> soule.
If you trauayle for goodes of this
worlde, to get your owne lyuyng,
or to helpe your frende, orels to pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uide
for your chyldren, when god
shal sende you them: let your tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uayle
be for the necessyties of the
body, and so finally for the soule.
Consydre what the goodes of the
worlde be, howe they be but instru<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mentes
for the body. Use then the
worlde in his kynde. Loke agayne
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:4548:12"/>
vpon your body, howe it is preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouser
then the goodes: vse hym the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>
in his worthynes, &amp; hurte not your
body for a thing of lesse valu. And
as ye haue nothinge, nother your
body nor your goodes, to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
with the dignite of your soule:
so my swete withipol, let nothinge
be in your reputation aboue this
chief &amp; principal iewel, the whiche
must only for him self be cared for,
&amp; al other thinges in this life, must
be cherished for it. I sticke moche
with you in repetinge one thynge,
but maruayle nat, though I so do:
For I se vs al in this world so blin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ded,
partly by a vse &amp; custome fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
cradil, in the magnifienge of these
goodis, partli by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>sa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>ple of them,
with whom we be daily conuersa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>t:
that scant after longe crieng it can
nowe be harde, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the soule must be
<pb facs="tcp:4548:13"/>
cheifly cared for. And except grace
worke with you, that you your self
wyll consent to the trouth, it is not
possible to perswade you, that the
very trewe way of lyuyng is this,
to care chiefly for the soule, and to
care for all other thynges onelye
for the soules sake. This sayenge
thoughe it be trewe, yet I saye, hit
can not be harde: in as moche the
lyues of all them, with whome ye
shalbe continuallye conuersaunt,
shall crye oute clene contrarye a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynste
my sayeng. For on al sides
you shall se menne sweatynge in a
contynuall worke, bothe of bodye
and of mynde, to get these world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
goodes, withoute any mention
made of the soules state: the whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
the verye friers care lyttel for:
as it openly appereth. But euer
I say to you, loke what Christen
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:4548:13"/>
men shuld do, and if you se men so
do, be glad of that syght, &amp; folowe
the same: if you se the contrarie, fle
from the ensample, and cleue euer
fastly to the trouthe, with a sorow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
harte for the losse of other men,
that so blyndely rushe forthe in the
trayne of a vicious lyuyng, where
the soule is so lyttel cared fore.</p>
            <p>¬∂That this firste thynge may be
y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> better in your study, I wil brefe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
touche som what of tho thynges
that appertein hereto: to haue you
knowe what nourisheth and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forteth
the soule, &amp; what hurteth
and noyeth the same. The soule
can not but euer lyue, it hath noo
ende of lyuynge, yet we may saye,
that the soule liueth and dyeth: It
liueth in the grace of god, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
in the malice of the diuel. The
soules lyfe is the lyghte of vertue:
<pb facs="tcp:4548:14"/>
his death is the derkenes of sinne.
You haue a free wyll gyuen you,
wherby you may either quicken or
slaye at your owne pleasure, your
soule in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bryght Paradise of life,
and you may set your soule in the
blacke dungeon of deathe. Let
therefore this wyll of yours euer
study to procure for the soules life,
the whiche is your owne lyfe: and
in the same study you shall delyuer
the soule from his death, the whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
is the perpetualle payne ordei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
for synne, that seperateth the
image of god frome his patrone.
I saye syn plucketh your soule fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>
god, whose image your soule shuld
beare. Therfore in all your actis
so doo, that you wyllyngely dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>please
not god: who canne not be
pleased but with a pure and clene
conscience, pure and cleane if you
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:4548:14"/>
suffre noo synne to remaygne soo
longe in your desyre and mynde,
that hit cankerethe the thoughte.
Your thoughte is cankered with
the longe resydence of synne: when
eyther you be weake in the studye
of vertue, orelles make verye lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telle
of a faulte, or defende youre
vyce, or nowselle youre selfe in a
custome of an inordynate desyre.
The fraylenes of our flesshe is so
greatte, that it canne not be, but
that syn shall come to our desyre:
but it is our blame, if synne tarye
and abyde within vs. God hath
gyuen vs a myghtye power ouer
our selfe: we maye when we wyll
correcte our desires, and dryue out
all synne. If you knowe not what
is synne, nor what is vertue: by
the feare and loue of god, you shal
knowe boothe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:4548:15"/>
The feare of god wylle teache you
to flee sinne and folowe vertu.<note place="margin">Feare of god. Loue of god.</note> The

what is to be done, and what
is not, than any diffinition or des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cryption
can appoynt oute to you.
Therfore my dere Withipoll, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warpe
your selfe faste and sure in
the fere and loue of god, from your
firste rysynge to your reste, drawe
forth the day in all your busynesse,

you may not leaue any poynte

if you wold somtyme take in your

rede it with a dewe reuerence. For
I wold not haue you in that boke

hit is god that there speakethe,
hit is you a poore creature of god
that redeth. Consider the matche,
<pb facs="tcp:4548:16"/>
and meke downe your wittes. Pre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sume

This is the surest way that you ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>

shal finde many lessons, that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perteine
to the thirde care. This
third care is for the goodes in this
world. In this part I can giue you
smal aduyse of my selfe, bycause I
haue had but smal experience here
in: yet euer I se, that you may not
in the study of gettyng these goo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,
leue or slake the chief care, for
the fyrste thynge, nor yet the seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>darye
care for the bodye. Labour
you muste for your lyuynge in a
dewe order, as in the thyrd degree
<pb facs="tcp:4548:20"/>
of your thinges. If matens, masse,
or a sermon be to be harde, set your
marcha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>dise aparte for the season,
&amp; prefer the mattens of your soule,
y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> loketh to haue suche gostly fode.
If the tyme require to haue you
take a mele, eyther a diner or a sup<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>per
for your refection, let not your
marcha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>dise defer the going therto
in a dewe tyme. For reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>bre, that
busines is one degree aboue your
marchandise.<note place="margin">Almes dede.</note> If you espie a pore
man to be in nede of your helpe,
hast to helpe him befor any eare of
makinge a bargayne, for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> worke
of mercy perteyneth to your chiefe
iewell: &amp; therfore your soule shall
growe in the grace of god. Breke
not moch, to the hurt of your helth
the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>uenient time of going to bed
for any occupatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>s or rekeninges
in your study for these goodes. For

making your bargaine kepe faith
and promise: deceiue no man with
any gyle or false color. For let it be
euer in your phantasie, howe the
gaines that you shuld get with su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
vntrue dealyng, be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>teined vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>der
your .iii. y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is to sey vnder your
lest care, wher y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> breking of faith &amp;
Íùìpmise, with false deceite &amp; vntrue
deling, sore hurteth your soule: in
whom resteth your chief thought.
And by falshed, you coulde not get
so moch of riches, as by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same you
shuld lose of honestie &amp; goodnes.
wherfore trauayle euer as the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gres
of these .iii. thinges shal req<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>re.
If an infinite hepe of worldly goo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>des
might be got with a smal hurte
&amp; damage of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> soule, forsake rather
<pb facs="tcp:4548:21"/>
that great heape, than you wolde
suffre this small hurte. There can
be no comparison betwene the sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les
helth and the riches: the leaste
droppe that can be of your soules
parte, must pondre and weye more
in your thought, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> al this world
besyde can do.</p>
            <p>¬∂Let not any similitude<note place="margin">Similitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des.</note> deceyue
your indgement. As if par cas a
man wolde reson, that the goodes
of the soule be all golde, the goo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des
of the worlde be all leade: all
thoughe that golde is euer better
than lede, yet there may be a great
qua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>tite of leade, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> shal be valured
aboue the smalle portion of golde.
So in your phantasy a great gai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
&amp; lucre of the worldly goodes
may seme better than a smal point
of our soules substaunce. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
he wyll conclude, that with a
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:4548:21"/>
lyttel losse of honestie or goodnes,
we maye venture to gette a greate
aduauntage in this worlde: and
some littel small portion we maye
borowe of our soule, to wynne by
that meanes a great summe of ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.
Beware good withipoll, of
suche reasonnyng, and to the deth,
to gayne al the hole royalte of this
hole worlde, neuer trespas against
your soule in the smallest iote that
can be imagined. As if ye might
be made a lorde of greate myght &amp;
power with abundance of posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
and goodes, onelye for the
speakynge in wyttenesse of one
worde agaynste the trouthe, with
grudge of your conscience: for
sake you all that offer, rather then
you wolde fele the priuey bytte of
your offence. For if you loke well,
you shal see, that there is a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb facs="tcp:4548:22"/>
valu of gaynes in the smallest

wer of riches: &amp; y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> losse of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> smal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lest

the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> the refusing or forgoing of al y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>

not like betwene the soules goodis
&amp; the goodes of this world, as it is
betwene golde and lead valured a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>boue
a peny weight of gold: where
there is no title so small of vertue,
that is not to be valured without
comparison aboue the hole power
of the erth and sees, throughe out
Asia, Affrica, and Europa. The
profe of my saieng dependeth here
vpon, that euery iote, euery title, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
mote of vertu, wherin is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined
y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> soules welthie state, hath

the spiritual goodes, both small &amp;

receiueth hir rewarde: Of the

y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> reineth ouer al them, as ouer

finde in their hartes to forsake ver<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tue
to wynne these false and vaine
goodes, that stande to vs in no er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily
stede: but for the shorte tyme
of a fewe yeres in this life, where y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>

Thus I shewe you good Edmo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>d,
that your care to get these worldly
goodes muste be subdued vnder
due order, as in his thyrde place.
But what be these goodes, &amp; what
wey you may laufully gette them,
I doubte not, but your father wyll
<pb facs="tcp:4548:23"/>
in tyme conuenint shewe you. He
is of that sorte of men, the whiche
hath by longe approued honestie
purchased hym a good name, and
is therby beloued and regarded of
good men: whose steppes if you
folowe, you shal by goddes grace
come to lyke worshyppe, and be of
lyke or more habilitie to leaue to
your childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> sufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>t to passe this
lyfe with. Here reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>bre, the more
your father loueth you, the lesse is
your thirde care: and the lesse that
your thirde care is, the more leiser
you haue to think vpon your chief
iewell, the whiche god hath gyuen
you to be ordered after your wyll,
in the whiche iewel you shall after
this lyfe well passed, haue the fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ition
of goddis presence, wherein
resteth the ioye ineffable of the bles<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sed
lammes. The gotis, that is to

say, the gredie soules of this third
care, the which neuer mendeth, or
very lyttel and weakely mendeth,
the fyrste care, shal remayne for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
more, in the peineful darknes,
where is nothynge but cryeng out
and lamentynge with frettyng of
stomakes, and snarrynge of teth,
as the gospell shall teache you: In
the whiche boke of god, you shall
here what an harde thyng it is for
a ryche man to entre in to heuen:
bicause that most commonly riche
men spend al theyr care &amp; thought
out of order, onely for this worlde,
and seldome or neuer they thinke
of theyr soule: and whenne they
thynke thereof, they soo thynke,
that they put that care far vnder
the care of these worldely busines,
doynge clene contrarye to this or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.
The whiche god wolde haue
<pb facs="tcp:4548:24"/>
vs to kepe. The which order thouh
you shal se very litel regarded of al

Enforce your selfe to be amonge
the few, &amp; forsake y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> multitude. Be
not drawe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> to an yuel opinion, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

You may by your self know, what

mind, what is chiefly in this Íùëte to
be cared fore: as the best portion of

worldely ryches. Surely I reken
no possession of londes, nor yet no

all things in this worlde, procure

most p<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>cious goodes. Alweys your

you, then any tresure or power be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side
can be. Nowe you shall know
them y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> be worthy to be your fren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis,
&amp; by what menes, &amp; what wey

I sayd, there be goodes of the

of this lyfe. But lette these wordes
be to you as not spoken in their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acte

but care we may not for neither of

were to take an inwarde weyghty

than is either our body, or the

for in very dede they be not good.
For this worde good includethe a

sworde, that ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> perce into this
<pb facs="tcp:4548:40"/>
place it is no misslucke of fortune
that can lyght vpon your spirite:
finally there is no diuel of hel, that
can fasten a stroke vpon you, to do
you in this place any hurte. This
shulde be a greatter gladnes vnto
you to considre, in howe stronge a
tower you be from all hurte: but
se thenne agayne, who hit is that
maye hurte you. For surelye you
ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> not be hurted but of one, in who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>
is power to do hurte: this is your
owne free wyl. This wyl of yours
&amp; nothing els, hath power to hurt
you. Se shortely in ensa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>ple, howe
your la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>des be take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> you, you be
spoyled of your goodes, fire bur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>neth
vp your house, you be haled
to priso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>, you be beate<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>, you be torne
with whips, you be drawe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> vpon y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
rackes, you lie in chaynes, you co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>e
forth to ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> shame, you suffre cold,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:4548:40"/>
you be gnawen with hunger and
thyrste, finallye you be putte to
death. what of al this? yet I can
not saye, that you be hurted: I se
that with al this the fauor &amp; grace
of good may co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>tinue with you, as
it did with the holy martyrs. And
also before Christis passion holye
Iob suffred al this, &amp; was not hur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ted.
This is a great co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>fort for you,
to se that nothing ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> hurt you but
only your owne selfe. This is the
hyghe grace of god, that so hathe
made man to be ouer al a myghty
conquerour, that can take no hurt
but of hym selfe. Wherfore I trust
you will lyue euer safe and sownd.
For I wyll not thynke, that euer
you wil be so mad, as to hurt your
selfe. Than for these trifles of the
body and worlde, take no care: it
it is neyther the seconde thyng nor
<pb facs="tcp:4548:41"/>
the thirde thynge, that canne be so
vnto you, that in eyther of theym
you can de hurted. Marie take
hede, lest by the displeasures done
in the second and in the thyrd, you
of madnes take occasion to be hur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ted,
and wyllyngelye hurte your
selfe in the fyrste thinge, the which
onely is the place, where you may
be hurted. And none besyde your
owne wyl hath power to hurt you
there: as if in the tyme of the losse
of worldly goodes, you wil fret in
anger, you wil dispise god, you wil
curse and ban, you wyl enforce to
be aue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>ged, you crye out in furie &amp;
madnes: now take you thought &amp;
care, for surely you be hurted, and
your chief iewel hath a great losse.
For god withdraweth from your
soule a great part of his grace: so
that this hurt you do to your own
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:4548:41"/>
selfe by this frowardenes. Lyke<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>wyse
whylste your body is turme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
eyther with sykenes or other<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>wise:
if you therfor forsake pacie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>ce,
and swelle in wrothe: you be than
hurted in dede, but of noone other
person besyde your selfe onely.</p>
            <p>Thus you may take fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> the seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>d
and the thyrde, in the whiche two
you can not be hurted, an occasion
to hurte your selfe, &amp; to haue ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
a greatte cause of a sore and an
erneste care, for the peril that your
soule therby falleth in.</p>
            <p>¬∂To confirme you the faster in

the trouth the worke is so briefely

a coment or a good mayster, you
shall not perceyue the fruite of the

haue therto leysure, to translate

finde suche swetenes in that boke,
that I beleue hit will rauishe you
in to an hygher contemplation,
than a greatte sorte of our religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous

beleue me, my good withipol, that
in redynge of these olde substanci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all

by reason that the moste parte of

men that rede these new flittering
workes, lacke perfecte iudgement
to dyscryue a weyghtye sentence
fro me a lyghte clause, the whiche
iudgemente can not be gotten, but
by a longe exercysynge of our wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes
with the best sorte of writers.</p>
            <p>And to me it is a pitiful thynge, to
beholde the folishe dremes of these
yonge clerkes in mens handes: &amp;
to se these noble olde workes of the
holy fathers and philosophers lye
vntouched. Where if these newe
wryters speke any thynge well, it
is piked out of this aunciente bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes.
But what so euer these petye
