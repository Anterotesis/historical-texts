            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A Brief Narrative of the Nature, &amp; Advantages of the LAND-BANK<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as Propoſed by Dr. <hi>Hugh Chamberlen,</hi> the Firſt <hi>Author</hi> of Founding a Bank on an Annual Revenue.</head>
            <p>THis <hi>Land-Bank,</hi> or General Office for <hi>Land-Credit,</hi> on the Terms herein af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter mentioned, Lends 8000 <hi>l.</hi> for 100 years, at the Intereſt of 5 <hi>s.</hi> or one quarter of One, <hi>per Cent<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>per Annum.</hi> The Loan is by <hi>Bills of Credit</hi> foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon Land beyond poſſibility of Loſs; and made current in Payments, by proper Expedients, to ſerve all the general Uſes and Offices of Money; a ſufficient Fund of Money being alſo provided, to anſwer ſuch particular Caſes as may poſſibly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire the uſual Species of Money. An hundred years Intereſt of 8000 <hi>l.</hi> at 5 <hi>s. per Cent<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> per Annum,</hi> amounts to 2000 <hi>l.</hi> and being added to the Principal, makes 10000 <hi>l.</hi> in the Total. Now becauſe 10000 <hi>l.</hi> is too great a Sum to be left to one Payment, at the end of 100 years; and becauſe it is far eaſier to the Borrower to pay it yearly by ſmall Sums; the Sum Total of 10000, is divided into 100 equal parts, and made year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly payable for 100 years, above all Repriſes, Taxes, Deductions, or Defalcations what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever.</p>
            <p>This far exceeds the Advantages by all other Banks, if the greatneſs of the Sum raiſed, the lowneſs of the Intereſt, and the eaſie Payments, be conſidered. Add to which, the Security given, and the manner of it; which is thus, (<hi>viz.</hi>) 150 <hi>l. per Annum</hi> in Land, is made over for 150 years, as a Caution, Pledge, or Penalty, for ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing the Payment of 100 <hi>l. per Annum,</hi> for 100 years: And during the whole Term, <hi>the Grantor is always in Poſſeſſion;</hi> and is free from any fear of being Outed, or Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed: The Nature, Deſign, and Conſtitution of this Office, being to Aſſiſt and Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, and not to Oppreſs and Ruine the Landed-Man. Of this 8000 <hi>l.</hi> principal Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney to be lent, 5000 <hi>l.</hi> is to be paid at ſeveral terms, to be diſpoſed at the will of the Subſcriber; and the other 3000 <hi>l.</hi> is to be employed in a ioynt Stock of Trade, for the common benefit of the Subſcribers, and as they ſhall direct: Which producing but 5 <hi>l. per Cent - per Annum</hi> Profit, will exonerate the Land in Effect, and make it no more than a Collateral Security; and puts 50 <hi>l.</hi> yearly beſides into the Subſcribers Purſe.</p>
            <p>Note, That this low Intereſt of 5 <hi>s. per Cent - per Annum,</hi> is to ſupport the whole Charge of the Office intirely; and to be the only Reward of the Contriver, who for above 30 years laſt paſt, at great loſs of time, and many Thouſands of Pounds to his Damage and Expence, hath indefatigably and ſtrenuouſly, and againſt great Diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements, conſtantly endeavoured to ſettle ſuch an Office.</p>
            <p>Every Subſcriber for payment of 100 <hi>l. per Annum</hi> to this Office for ſuch Annuity, is alſo to pay or advance to the Office, of the current Coin of the Nation, at ſeveral terms, 1000 <hi>l.</hi> And this Money is not given, nor adventured, but exchanged for Bills, as one of the means for aſſiſting the Currency of the Bills, till their true Value be known. And there will be Expedients for ſuch as cannot, unaſſiſted, comply with the Raiſing of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Money. The manner of paying-in this 1000 <hi>l.</hi> in Money, is to be thus, <hi>vizt.</hi> 400 <hi>l.</hi> when the Eſtate is ſettled; 300 <hi>l.</hi> at the end of the firſt year, 200 <hi>l.</hi> at the end of the ſecond year, and 100 <hi>l.</hi> at the end of the third year. And the manner of <hi>Receiving</hi> out the Bills of Credit, is to be thus: <hi>vizt.</hi> 1000 <hi>l.</hi> when the Eſtate is ſettled; being at the ſame time the 400 <hi>l.</hi> in Money is paid in, as aforeſaid: 1100 <hi>l.</hi> at the end of the firſt year, 1200 <hi>l.</hi> at the end of the ſecond year, 1300 <hi>l.</hi> at the end of the third year, and 1400 <hi>l.</hi> at the end of the fourth year: Which is 6000 <hi>l.</hi> in Bills, including the 1000 <hi>l.</hi> Bills exchanged for ſo much Money; which Money, together with 2000 <hi>l.</hi> more in Bills, is paid to the Treaſurer of the Joynt-Stock in Trade.</p>
            <p>The firſt years Rent of this 100 <hi>l.</hi> yearly Rent-Charge, is to be paid at the end of the ſecond year, after ſettling the Eſtate.</p>
            <p>None are to ſubſcribe leſs than 15 <hi>l. per annum</hi> for the payment of 10 <hi>l.</hi> nor more than <hi>1500l.</hi> for the payment of 1000 <hi>l.</hi> nor that but till Securities ſhall be ſubſcribed for payment of <hi>50000l</hi> For after that, probably ſome reſtraints in Subſcriptions may be neceſſary, in order to render the Uſes and Advantages of this Office more univerſal and diffuſive; and tho' here a remark be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious, that the Subſcribers of the firſt 50000 <hi>l.</hi> may have a Priviledge and Enlargement, that their Followers cannot receive without cramping the Deſign, and prejudicing one another; yet the Office, and all its appendant Benefits, being dormant, till 50000 <hi>l.</hi> be ſubſcribed, it is very conſiſtent with Reaſon, that thoſe have at firſt a more enlarged ſcope for ſubſcribing, whoſe completion alone qualifies others, and without which none could be admitted to any thing.</p>
            <p>The inſtance here given is of 100 <hi>l. per annum</hi> Rent-Charge, ſecured to the Office, from whence any leſs or greater Rent-Charge may without much difficulty be computed, to which computa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion this Rule may help, <hi>vizt.</hi> Two thirds of the Security-Rents, or 100 <hi>l. per annum,</hi> (for ſo much Rent is two thirds of 150 <hi>l. per annum</hi>) being multiplied by 100 years, which is two thirds of 150 years, the term ſettled by way of Security for 100 years, the Product is a Sum raiſed or valued on that Eſtate. And this Sum is thus to be diſpoſed and proportioned, <hi>vizt.</hi> one half to the Subſcriber in Bills, three Tenths for his Share in a Joynt-Stock of Trade, and the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb facs="tcp:58527:2"/>
one Fifth pays the Intereſt of 5 <hi>s. per Cent<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>per Annum,</hi> as before, to ſupport this Office, and all its Contingencies.</p>
            <p>The Rule for advancing of Money is one Tenth of the ſaid Product, or one Fifth of the Sum Received in Bills by the Subſcribers; or again, Ten times the Yearly Rent. But although 150 <hi>l. per annum</hi> is generally required to ſecure the payment of 100 <hi>l. per annum,</hi> becauſe that Sum multiplied by 150 years, the term made over for ſecurity of 100 years payment, produces 22500 <hi>l</hi> for ſecuring but 10000 <hi>l.</hi> really to be raiſed, which gives more than a double value to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Bill: Yet where Rent-Charges or Chief Rents, on the one hand; or Leaſe-hold, or Houſes on the other hand, can be proper Securities to the Bank; more or leſs of them, than juſt one third of the Rent-Charge, is to be taken; ſo as to bring them to as near a proportion as may be, with the Settlements of Lands in general; that ſo the value of the Tickets may be duly ſecured.</p>
            <p>This Office is undertaken under the power and protection of the Laws in being; and ſince it is not, nor imports, more than a legal, equal, and a fair Management, and tranſacting of a well-regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated Credit; founded by voluntary and legal Settlements of Eſtates of particular Perſons; it can no more be violated, or broken in upon, than Propriety it ſelf, which our Laws have made ſacred.</p>
            <p>There are two Sheets lately Printed, that give a more full and large Account of this matter: And the Doctor himſelf is ready further to explain and vindicate this Deſign to any ſo deſiring, at his Houſe in <hi>Eſſex-ſtreet,</hi> every <hi>Monday, Wedneſday</hi> and <hi>Friday</hi> in the evening; at which Place Subſcriptions are alſo taken.</p>
            <p>The Dr. means to open his Office, in order to the general good and Service of the Engliſh Crown and N<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>bſcriptions are made for ſecuring the payments of 50000. <hi>l. per annum</hi> to the ſaid Office in manner as before.</p>
            <p>The Annuities or Rent-charges, are to be made payable in the Bills of Credit, delivered out by the Office: Yet, ſo as that Money may be alſo accepted, when offered by the Subſcribers for their Eaſe and Convenience.</p>
            <p>The Bills that Yearly come in for Rent, are to be cancelled, with all exactneſs: So that at the end of the term of 100. Years, there ſhall be none of them in being; but all ſh<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ll be cancelled and deſtroy'd. And on this ſecret, the certain real Value and Security of the Bills is inde<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e than double value in Land, which is beyond Contradiction, the beſt of Funds, there can be little or no doubt of their currency. But further, beſides a very great Fund of Money provided to aſſiſt their circulation; every Subſcriber is obliged in intereſt to contribute his utmoſt to the currency of them. For ſhould not this Office ſucceed, by what other means can any Man hope to raiſe Fourſcore Years value for a Rent-charge of 100 Years, where he is ſtill Maſter of his Land; and where the Income of the Trade will probably more than twice pay his Rent-charge? But what recommends this undertaking far above all others, is—The great and juſt expectations of extraordinary gain: And the impoſſibility of any loſs. The gain is by the great Sum advanced; and by the great Joynt-ſtock in Trade. The impoſſibility of Loſs, is Firſt, in that the Rent-charges will certainly call them all in: which gives them a real value, and makes them ſafe: And next, it is readily agreed on all hands, and is indeed obvious in it ſelf, that if the Bills run two or three Years, they can never ceaſe to be current; and if they ſtop in that time, or indeed at any time, this Bank or Office is in a condition to make intire Satisfaction to all. For if the whole of the Subſcribers, or any great part of them, will call in all the Money upon their Bills, to ſuch a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue as this Office cannot readily comply with, in the Species of Money: Then will the Office re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore to all or any ſuch Perſon or Perſons his or their Eſtate or Eſtates; and the ready Money by them paid-in at ſetling ſuch Eſtates; in caſe of repayment to the Office of all the Bills of Credit iſſued thereupon. And this makes any loſs by this undertaking to be quite impoſſible; which is what cannot be made out conce<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

            <p>But divers Gentlemen who have great Eſtates in Money, taking Umbrage at this Deſign; and apprehending the Conſequences thereof, may too far affect them, in depreſſing Money, as it raiſes Land: The Doctor further propoſes, that this Bank or Office may One or more of theſe three ways, beſides others which time will ſhow, be of uſe to Moneyed-men, <hi>viz.</hi>
