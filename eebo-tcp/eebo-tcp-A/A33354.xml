            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Eing now to expose this <hi>Poetical Essay</hi> to the mercy of the <hi>censuring World,</hi> and considering, under whose Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronage I might adventure the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication: I humbly presum'd your Lordship, both as a person eminent in Piety, Virtue, and Learning; and by the <hi>high Character</hi> you bear in the Government as supream Judge of that Illustrious Court, upon which my Profession as a Lawyer has af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded me a dependance now these many years, to be the only Person, to whom I could with honour dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate this Proiece; especially being encourag'd to it by your Lordships generous perusal, and approbation of some of the Sheets in privat.</p>
            <p>I do therefore, my Lord, address this Poetical Composure to your Lordship, as to a Person, whose sublime Soul I know entertains the true Sentiments of Mortality, and the transient vanity of this World, of which <hi>this admirable Book of JOB</hi> affords so large, and spacious a Field for Contemplation, as a Mind but even a little elevate above the Dust of the World, and furnish'd but with ordinary Parts, may in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Meditations on the several Texts, far exceed my most polish'd Reflections on the Subject: the exercise of Contemplation being so pleasing to an ingenuous Spirit, as what in other Sciences reiteration renders nauseous, in this it adds fresh Desires, and makes the Soul so enamou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:61096:3"/>The ground of my Address to your Lordship proceeding then from that esteem, which all this Nation has for you, as a Person, who, in the Affairs of greatest Importance, affords daily Proofs of your eminent Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, I do not so much, as approach the borders of Flattery, if I name your Lordship one of the prime Ornaments of the Age, in which you live.</p>
            <p>For seriously, my Lord, when I compare the Figure you make in the State, with that of your years, (contrary to the Vulgar opinion, <hi>That Wisdom only dwells in aged Breasts;</hi>) I must acknowledge with the learned young man, who bears no small part in the ensuing Discourses, that—<hi>There is a spirit in man, and the instigation of the Almighty giveth under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But as your Promotion, my Lord, in so small advance of years to the high Dignity, in which you now move, makes me admire the <hi>vivacity, and felicity</hi> of your wit, so (to augment the wonder) when I consider your Lordships younger Brother at this same time, shining in that emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent station of <hi>Secretary of State,</hi> making thus betwixt you the most <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="3 letters">

            </p>
            <p>May this <hi>bright Constellation</hi> long shine in the Orb of our Government, and as you increase in Years, so may you both increase in Piety, and Virtue, advance in <hi>His Majesties Royal esteem,</hi> and the love of your Countrey, until such time, as two such refined Souls being translated to eternal Felicity, may make a fairer appearance in the Court of <hi>the King of kings,</hi> then mortal Men can make in that of a King upon Earth, to which the good Wishes shall never be deficient of him, whose Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is to be esteem'd,</p>

            <p>SInce men do no less differ in their Judgments, and apprehensions of what they read, in this then in former Ages, and that some out of envy, others out of malice, or ignorance do either abstain from perusing of Compositions of the nature of the ensuing Treatise; or having perused such (though never so well accommodate with all the embellishments of W<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t, and Art) in the same humour decry them, it is usual for Authors to make Apologies for publishing of what many of them pretend were never design'd for the Light but importunity of Friends, or Copies surreputiously creeping abroad, oblig'd them to a Publication, though in reality their only design was an itch of Applause, only to be attained by the brokery of the Press, as if a few polish'd expressions in the entry of their Writings were able to divert the torrent of the <hi>censuring Readers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hence tedious Prefaces, and joyn'd with these a deal of Encomiums are posted in the Avenues of all our modern Writings, only to put the Readers in an humor before perusal, and invite them to an appetite for their <hi>Crudities.</hi> But what is here published I acknowledge was originally design'd for the Press, and so stands in need of no such <hi>inviting Complement,</hi> the Publication being as necessary, by the rules of my Circumstances, as the Composition was, which was so far from being calculate to the <hi>Meridian of Applause,</hi> as I never projected a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable reception of it, but made my account, (as I yet do) for censure, and the worst of usage, with all which I am resolv'd to dispense, in confidence that all ingenuous and impartial Readers will find my design in it has been only to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leviate the severity of my own sad Circumstances.</p>
            <p>It is true indeed, the publishing my private Reflections upon a Subject of such sacred Importance, as is that admirable <hi>Book of JOB,</hi> may be esteem'd a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption in one of my Profession, whose business is generally to mind secular Affairs, and not to make such in-roads into Divinity; but with the good fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of the learned, and worthy Clergy (for whom no man has greater esteem then I have) I hope it will be acknowledged, that the Scripture being a Theme in which we are all equally concern'd as to perusal, and instruction; if I, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the opinions of the best of Commentators on the Subject, have, at my so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary opportunities express'd my thoughts in Poesy upon the several Texts, as I found those of their own Profession have learnedly instructed me in Prose, my greatest Crime in this Publication, is only that I am not of their Order.</p>

I apply the Text to the <hi>Crime of Piracy,</hi> being induc'd thereto by the words of the preceeding Texts, wherein <hi>Job</hi> enumerates several special Crimes at Land, and probably might thence take a rise to discourse of that notorious Crime of <hi>Piracy,</hi> of which in all appearance he had frequently heard, living so nigh the <hi>Red-Sea,</hi> which was then and is yet much infested with Pyrats: and authorized besides by the concurse of the learned <hi>Grotius, Vatablus,</hi> and our Countrey-man Mr. <hi>Hutchison</hi> in the same opinion.</p>
            <p>I would request then those of that venerable Order to have that charity for me, as to think I did not attempt a work of this importance, <hi>hand over head,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:61096:4"/>
(as the Proverb is,) but to peruse, and examine the whole, and I hope they will find I have proceeded in it with that deference, as is due to the Subject.</p>
            <p>To the Vulgar Objection against this Piece, that it has been frequently per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in Verse already by others, I make no further answer then that all I have ever seen, <hi>Sylvester, Herbert,</hi> and <hi>Quarrels,</hi> do perform it in a simple transposition of the words of Prose into Rythme, whereas I have not followed that method, but according as the several Texts afforded Subject, I have presum'd to expatiate, by way of Poetical Lectures, and (which was the greatest diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty in all the Composure) have endeavoured to connect the several Texts in continued Discourses, notwithstanding of the abrupt transitions from one Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to another, and frequent Hebraisms all along, which hardly admit of a genuine exposition in Prose, and by consequence, are more difficult to be cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled in Verse. Nor if I had followed the methods of these Gentlemen exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, do I commit any novelty in this Essay, if men will consider how many Translations have been publish'd of <hi>Virgil, Horace,</hi> &amp;c. yet do not these hinder some of the most refined Wits of the Age to publish their Translations of the same Authors to this very day, for were it no more but the new dress of the present and current Language, it makes a great difference from a Transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion Fifty Years ago.</p>
            <p>This Book of <hi>JOB</hi> I know is by some repute no real History, but a Parable, and to have been writ Originally in Poesy, but I am concluded by the positive words of the Text, <hi>There was a man,</hi> &amp;c. or if it was, as these suppose, certainly the Mythology is of great use and instruction for all Christians, for, by the whole Contexture I look upon <hi>Jobs</hi> Troubles to have much consisted in <hi>Oppression and Calumny,</hi> which are the two hardest species of Affliction for an ingenuous Spirit to bear, as he appears to have been, especially when his Friends, stead of comforting him, seem all along to second those clamourous reports of him, that had been spread through the whole Countrey on that occasion; so that all his doleful Circumstances consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, his loss of Children, Estate, Reputation, and aggravation of his Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions by his too zealous Friends, who maintain'd his Punishments were no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the return of his Sins, he appears to quadrate with that excellent ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression of <hi>Boetius,</hi> in his second Book, de Con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Upon this consideration I have attempted<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and finished this Essay, and in a Poetical Strain humoured the several Discourses from the beginning to the end: and if I have been somewhat free in my Characters and Descriptions of the Vices of this present Age, as I found the Texts afforded me Subject, let the Persons concerned, (if any such be) <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>onsider, the Spirit of God, in all Ages, as appears by the whole Tract of Sacred Writ, has inveigh'd against such Villanies; and I following the Text, could do no less in Poesy, then what the Prose in few words seem'd to poin out. And for my description of the Adulterer (which some Criticks may possibly judge a little too particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,) let them consider <hi>Solomons</hi> description of his whorish Woman, which is a sufficient authority for me.</p>
            <p>Further I have not to say, introductory to the perusal, but if I be judged in this Composition a most presumptuous <hi>Interloper</hi> in the Trade of Wit, my answer is, I never did, nor do yet pretend to that Character: let the florid
<pb facs="tcp:61096:4"/>
Wits of our Age enjoy their Trade intire, for me, a great part of my design in this Composure being only to make attonement for my former wanton excursions in this Art; and if I meet with censure, or applause, I am indifferent: for when I consider how many polish'd Wits of our Age have employed their Parts of late in Projections destructive to themselves, and their Families; I think the small Parts God has allowed me have been better employed in this unprofitable Composition, which I hope upon perusal will be found to savour neither of a bad Christian, nor a bad Subject; for before I would do any thing contrare to the Character of either, to obtain the reputation of a contriving Wit—<hi>Ridenda Poemata malo.</hi>

                  <l>Plundred of all;—Estate, and issue too,</l>
                  <l>Why sure I shall be no more envy'd now.</l>
                  <l>Now I'm undone, now absolutely poor,</l>
                  <l>As those, who beg their Bread from Door to Door.</l>
                  <l>Then what do Wealth and Honours signify</l>
                  <l>When, as it were by turning of a dye,</l>
                  <l>All I possest is now entirely lost:</l>
                  <l>Then what is he, who doth of Riches boast!</l>
                  <l>Riches!—the very Dregs of the Creation,</l>
                  <l>A naughty thing, that never came in fashion,</l>

                  <l>Torrents of Falshoods, Jealousies, and Feares!</l>
                  <l>Riches a lean, dry Nurse of Anxious Cares!</l>
                  <l>A Food, on which we feed with great delyte,</l>
                  <l>Yet ne'r allays our ravenous appetite.</l>
                  <l>Mans Life-race running in a crooked Line,</l>
                  <l>A dash, which spoil'd the' original design</l>
                  <l>Of his Integrity; a thing, which all,</l>

                  <l>Th'abstract of Madness, when Eternity</l>
                  <l>Appears at hand, and they begin to dye.</l>
                  <l>For O what help can Riches then afford</l>
                  <l>To their deluded Owners? in a word</l>
                  <l>No Man of Judgment should of Riches boast,</l>
                  <l>For, when (as mine) they are entirely lost,</l>
                  <l>Then they appear to have been very Dreams,</l>
                  <l>Which none but he, who softly sleeps, esteems.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>And then, there's Honour too. that taudry thing,</l>
                  <l>Of which poor Mortals make such reckoning:</l>
                  <l>Why I had that, as much as I desir'd</l>
                  <l>And to no higher Honours I aspir'd:</l>
                  <l>But now—all's lost—Riches, and Honours too</l>
                  <l>Have all abandon'd their old Master now.</l>
                  <l>Then what is this same Idol, of which most</l>
                  <l>Of its proud Owners insolently boast?</l>
                  <l>What is it pray!—a meer Device of Men</l>

                  <l>The Reputation of a Bankrupt Race,</l>
                  <l>Which long ago was forfeit in the Case</l>
                  <l>Of the first cadet; when Fraternal Tyes</l>
                  <l>Could not obstruct Friends being Enemies</l>
                  <l>For a small triffle: though the World was then</l>
                  <l>But Tripartite, and those unhappy Men</l>
                  <l>Had Elbow-room enough; yet was it State</l>
                  <l>First troubled under <hi>that Triumvirate.</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>And then our Native Honour, Truth, and Faith</l>

                  <l>Since then true Honours lost, why should we cheat</l>
                  <l>Our Reason with its silly counterfeit!</l>
                  <l>And fancy Titles, Names, and Dignities</l>

                  <l>In Virtues Orb? Why should we proudly boast</l>
                  <l>We have a thing our Predecessours lost!</l>
                  <l>For to this day (let us say what we can)</l>

                  <l>Why should vain man its empty shadow chace!</l>
                  <l>Its empty shadow,—yes—its meer reflex,</l>
                  <l>Which only, when it shines, a figure makes.</l>
                  <l>Though, as an Evening shadow to the Eye</l>
                  <l>Extends it self beyond the Symmetry</l>
                  <l>Of what it follows; so this flattering thing</l>
                  <l>By poor deluded Mortals Reckoning</l>
                  <l>Appears t'exceed the true Original,</l>
                  <l>Whilest really it is nothing at all,</l>
                  <l>And disappears with that same swiftness too,</l>
                  <l>As when the Sun sets, all your shadows do.</l>
                  <l>Or if it something be, at best I take it,</l>
                  <l>To be but what each Fools conceit doth make it,</l>
                  <l>For, as we see how Hobby-horses please</l>

                  <l>On Fire, and Sword, others themselves do please</l>
                  <l>With what they can attain to with more ease,</l>
                  <l>And less expence, so cunningly practise</l>

                  <l>Ay me!—a sentence cruel, and severe!</l>
                  <l>A doom, in which great malice doth appear!</l>
                  <l>Now pray, my friends, <hi>by what authoritie</hi>

                  <l>
                     <hi>Act you these things?</hi> who gave you libertie</l>
                  <l>To give out Judgment thus? for to this hour</l>
                  <l>I never heard that any of you had power</l>
                  <l>From our Great God to excommunicat</l>
                  <l>The poorest Wretch on Earth.—</l>

                     <hi>In acts of mercy he doth so abound</hi>

                  <l>Indeed, in that case, I should soon despair,</l>

                  <l>As you alledge: I know he is more just</l>

                  <l>Not to condole with me, but to torment</l>
                  <l>My Soul with arguing, whilst my present state</l>
                  <l>Requires smooth language, and not rough debate.</l>
                  <l>Thus by discourse, obliging me to speak,</l>
                  <l>In answer to you, when I am so weak,</l>
                  <l>As I can hardly move my lips: when all</l>

                  <l>Indeed you had as good a stay'd at home.</l>
                  <l>For I conceive this kind of disputing,</l>
                  <l>Can to afflicted men no comfort bring.</l>
                  <l>No, no more, then if one should see his friend</l>
                  <l>Fall'n in a pit, and should be so unkind,</l>
                  <l>As 'stead of helping of him out, to tell him,</l>
                  <l>'Tis for his sins this accident befell him.</l>

                  <l>'Stead of upholding my decaying spirits,</l>
                  <l>You always tell me, thus each Mortal merits</l>

                  <l>To his Creator: <hi>whose own Conscience</hi>

                  <l>Then what are you concern'd? if I have err'd,</l>
                  <l>The worse is mine: and if I hav prefer'd</l>

                  <l>His innocence, and made the same appear</l>
                  <l>By evidence, as Sun at noon-tide, clear:</l>

                  <l>The dismal news of thy sad suffering,</l>
                  <l>When of thy many losses we did hear,</l>

                  <l>We did thy griefs as heavilie bemoan,</l>
                  <l>As if thy losses had been all our own:</l>
                  <l>Nor could we in our troubled minds have peace,</l>
                  <l>When men inform'd us of thy woful case,</l>
                  <l>Until we see thy self, and so forsook</l>
                  <l>All that was dear to us, and undertook</l>
                  <l>A tedious journey to this place, that so</l>
                  <l>We might perform, what every man doth owe</l>
                  <l>To real friendship: that we might condole</l>
                  <l>Thy sufferings, and from our very soul</l>
                  <l>Lament with thee, as one, for whom we still</l>

                  <l>We hasted hither, not that we might feed</l>
                  <l>Our eyes with such a woful spectacle,</l>
                  <l>As now alace we do behold, or fill</l>
                  <l>The appetites of envy, and revenge,</l>
                  <l>With observations on so sad a change.</l>
                  <l>No we come hither only to declare,</l>
                  <l>That as thy friends we mean't to bear a share</l>
                  <l>In thy afflictions, and so thou didst see,</l>
                  <l>Seven days we sat in complaisance with thee,</l>
                  <l>With Garments rent, and ashes on our Head,</l>
                  <l>Not speaking word more then we had been dead.</l>
                  <l>We beat our breasts, we bow'd, we sigh'd, and weep't,</l>
                  <l>And with thy sorrows a true cadence kep't.</l>
                  <l>We had resolv'd on silence.</l>
                  <l>But when we heard thee with great violence,</l>
                  <l>Exclaim against the works of Providence:</l>
                  <l>When we did hear thee bitterly arraign</l>
                  <l>The Justice of our God once, and again;</l>
                  <l>When with great fury thou didst execrat</l>
                  <l>The hour, that gave thee Birth, and with such heat</l>
                  <l>Pursue thy foolish wishes; as if he,</l>
                  <l>Who out of meanest Dust Created thee,</l>
                  <l>Who By his powerful Breath did make thee live,</l>
                  <l>Who did to thee, wealth, honours, issue give,</l>
                  <l>Were still oblig'd to keep thee in that state,</l>
                  <l>And had no freedom to eradicate</l>
                  <l>Thee, and thy race, as well, as other men,</l>
                  <l>Who surely, (were it lawful to complain)</l>
                  <l>Could in as sad, and mournful tone declare,</l>
                  <l>How they did once live, and what now they are.</l>
                  <l>When we did hear thee, with such impudence,</l>
                  <l>At all occasions plead thy innocence,</l>
                  <l>As if our God had been unjust, indeed</l>
                  <l>We might ha' fear'd to ha' been punished</l>
                  <l>As well as thou, if we had held our peace,</l>
                  <l>And not maintain'd his Justice in the case.</l>
                  <l>For who I pray could such discourses hear,</l>
                  <l>And after all from answering forbear?</l>
                  <l>On this account we've spoke, and spoke again,</l>
                  <l>And for the love we bear to thee, would fain</l>
                  <l>Reclaim thee from thy errors, but alace</l>
                  <l>I fear 'tis all in vain: we do expresse</l>
                  <l>Our selves, as men, that really do fear</l>
                  <l>Their God, in all our words, and do appear</l>
                  <l>To be thy friends, but hitherto we see</l>
                  <l>There's no convincing such a man, as thee.</l>
                  <l>For it appears that thou art obstinate</l>
                  <l>In error, and <hi>with all thy soul dost hate</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>
                     <hi>To be reformed:</hi> esteeming none thy friend,</l>
                  <l>Who in discourse will be so free, and kind,</l>
                  <l>As tell thee of thy faults, and let thee see,</l>
                  <l>How many men have been as well as thee</l>
                  <l>Oppress'd in spirit, and in body too,</l>

                     <pb n="154" facs="tcp:61096:82"/>And yet have never kep't so much adoe,</l>
                  <l>As thou hast done in all their sufferings,</l>

                  <l>Against their Maker: not to speak of us,</l>
                  <l>Thy friends, whom thou dost openly abuse.</l>
                  <l>For I've observ'd, friend, that when <hi>Eliphaz</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>Did learn'dly speak, thou told him, in his face,</l>
                  <l>He did not understand so much as thou</l>
                  <l>Did know of Gods great works: when <hi>Bildad</hi> too</l>
                  <l>Express'd his mind <hi>in golden Eloquence,</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>And truly spoke, with as much deference</l>
                  <l>To thy condition, as men did of late,</l>
                  <l>When thou didst triumph in thy prosprous state,</l>
                  <l>Thou said his tale had formerly been told,</l>
                  <l>And, so on what he spoke, thou laid no hold,</l>
                  <l>For he knew nothing, but <hi>to rail, and scold.</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>
                     <hi>As for my self,</hi> however I did speak,</l>
                  <l>Thou told me <hi>all my arguments were weak.</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>For my part therefore, seing 'twas in vain</l>
                  <l>To speak, I was resolved to abstain</l>
                  <l>From further talking, but that now I see</l>
                  <l>Thou'rt pleas'd of late forsooth to challenge me,</l>

                  <l>Then <hi>Silver</hi> is produc'd, which they esteem</l>
                  <l>As baser, and <hi>Gold's younger Brother name.</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>Then, when the substance of these is impure,</l>
                  <l>And they're not mix'd with <hi>aequilibrature,</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>Nor in earths bowels duely tempered,</l>
                  <l>They do become <hi>Tinn, Iron, Copper, Lead.</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>Against this too, there's others do debate,</l>
                  <l>And say all <hi>Minerals</hi> are procreat</l>
                  <l>From th'mixture of thin Earth, with whitest Water,</l>
                  <l>Which they affirm to be the only matter</l>
                  <l>Whence Mettals do proceed, and that 'tis so,</l>
                  <l>They prove, 'cause Mettals do like Water flow,</l>
                  <l>By strength of Fire: from whence they do assert,</l>
                  <l>As all things are reduc'd, <hi>by Rules of Art,</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>To their first Principles, so when we see</l>
                  <l>Those Mettals flow, their Matter sure must be</l>
                  <l>Some <hi>liquid thing:</hi> for so they say 'tis plain,</l>
                  <l>VVhen they by cold are soon condens'd again</l>
                  <l>As waters are. Others again assert,</l>
                  <l>And labour to make out, by Rules of Art,</l>
                  <l>That out of Earth, and VVater mix'd, adust,</l>

                  <l>Springs <hi>Vitriol,</hi> which doth all Mettals breed,</l>
                  <l>From which, as their first Matter, they proceed.</l>
                  <l>Because all Mettals, when dissolv'd, appear</l>
                  <l>Like <hi>Vitriol:</hi> besides they say, 'tis clear,</l>
                  <l>That <hi>Oyl</hi> from <hi>Vitriol Sublimat</hi> is drawn,</l>
                  <l>By which all Mettals are reduc'd again</l>
                  <l>To their first Matter. Others there be yet;</l>
                  <l>VVho on this <hi>Subject</hi> eagerly debate,</l>
                  <l>That from earths intrails a dry breath ascends,</l>
                  <l>VVhich mix't with <hi>watry vapours</hi> upward tends,</l>
                  <l>And, as it meets with earth accommodate,</l>
                  <l>And by its matter become Sublimate,</l>

                  <l>And it <hi>Gold, Silver, Lead, Iron, Copper</hi> grows.</l>
                  <l>And last of all, there's others that debate</l>
                  <l>That Mettals are all truly procreat</l>
                  <l>'Twixt <hi>th'elements,</hi> which do give both to all,</l>

                  <l>Sure 'tis a matter worth our admiration,</l>
                  <l>To think Earths bowels doth such things prepare</l>

                  <l>First let's observe what we in <hi>Silver</hi> see,</l>

                  <l>Then <hi>Lead,</hi> or <hi>Copper,</hi> soon procures a name.</l>
                  <l>After it's washen, sifted, melted, cast</l>
                  <l>In <hi>massy Ingots,</hi> stamp'd, and coyn'd at last,</l>
                  <l>Above <hi>its fellow Minerals,</hi> and doth hold</l>

                  <l>That gold is such a Mettal, as the fire,</l>

                  <l>Next as a mark of its true purity,</l>
                  <l>We see it has this singular quality,</l>

                  </l>

                  <l>Nor can the Hammer in the least prevail</l>

                  <l>Have always studied since my Infancy</l>
                  <l>
                     <hi>The Art of Continence:</hi> for in the least</l>
                  <l>An <hi>unclean thought</hi> never possess't my breast.</l>
                  <l>I always hated <hi>wanton Company,</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>And still dislik'd that <hi>Foolish Railery,</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>In which young men their time do poorly waste,</l>
                  <l>
                     <hi>Making their sin the Subject of their Jest.</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>Nor did I ere desire to be acquaint</l>
                  <l>With those, <hi>whose eyes do make our blood ferment.</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>No, in such <hi>Intrigues,</hi> I would ne're engage,</l>
                  <l>Lest I might perish by <hi>Loves cousenage,</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>And like the foolish young men of our time,</l>
                  <l>
                     <hi>To purchase pleasure, think no sin a crime.</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>For this cause, knowing that such <hi>Fooleries</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>Do steal in at <hi>the Wicket of the Eyes:</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>With these I quickly did <hi>confederate,</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>And in my <hi>Treaty,</hi> firmly stipulate,</l>
                  <l>They should not see a Maid at any rate.</l>
                  <l>They should not on <hi>that pleasant Object</hi> look,</l>
                  <l>Because the Bait did usher in the Hook:</l>
                  <l>But shun to see <hi>that curious piece of Nature<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>Lest I were tempted with <hi>its lovely feature.</hi>
                  </l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>For with my self I still considered<note place="margin">2. For what portion of God is there from above? and what in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance from the Almighty on high.</note>
                  </l>
                  <l>This was a sin by Law prohibited,</l>
                  <l>A <hi>crying sin,</hi> and therefore to be fear'd</l>
                  <l>In <hi>Heavens Court</hi> it would be sooner heard</l>
                  <l>Then I my self, and make the Divine wrath</l>
                  <l>Pursue me, and my Familie to death.</l>
                  <l>I thought too with my self, should those, who claim</l>
                  <l>An Interest in Heaven be barr'd, with shame,</l>
                  <l>From Gods good presence by the hateful means</l>
                  <l>
                     <hi>Of a poor nasty sin:</hi> hence I took pains,</l>
                  <l>So to secure my heart, that, at no time,</l>
                  <l>The thoughts of <hi>this abominable crime</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>Might slip into it: and for one short pleasure,</l>
                  <l>I came to forfault <hi>an eternal Treasure.</hi>

               <lg>
                  <l>Yes <hi>an eternal Store,</hi> a Happiness<note place="margin">3. Is not destruction to the wicked, and a strange punishment to the workers of iniquity.</note>
                  </l>
                  <l>No Humane Art, or Language can express,</l>
                  <l>For one <hi>poor Moments pleasure,</hi> Lord how sad</l>

                  </l>
                  <l>That those <hi>poor slaves,</hi> though they by Law were made</l>
                  <l>My servile Subjects, yet both they and I</l>
                  <l>Were subject to that King who sits on high</l>

                  <l>Had I refus'd to hear their exclamations,</l>

                  <l>Had I abused that authority,</l>

                  <l>Yet let me tell you, in a sober sense,</l>
                  <l>I truly think there is great difference</l>
                  <l>Betwixt that Blood stamp'd by a Prince, and that,</l>
                  <l>On which unspoted Virtue sets a rate,</l>
                  <l>The first, like vapours by the Sun exhal'd</l>
                  <l>From Lakes, and Ditches, justly may be call'd,</l>
                  <l>Which do not firmly in the Clouds remain,</l>
                  <l>But quickly either in <hi>Hail, Snow,</hi> or <hi>Rain,</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>Do from their stations tumble down again.</l>
                  <l>For as by <hi>Princes smiles,</hi> that Blood was rais'd,</l>
                  <l>So by their frowns, it is as soon debas'd.</l>
                  <l>Their anger taints that <hi>current</hi> in a tryce;</l>
                  <l>On which their favour lately set a price,</l>
                  <l>Which now diverted from its former course,</l>
                  <l>Appears as low, and cheap as in <hi>the source.</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>But that by virtue rais'd, we may compare</l>
                  <l>To <hi>Elemental waters,</hi> which do there</l>
                  <l>Dwell, with a firm design of remanence,</l>

                  <l>Did rather for him, then against him plead.</l>

                  <l>With which he thought those men were richly stor'd,</l>

                  <l>And he, with patience, had some time attended,</l>

                  <l>I'me young, says he, 'tis true, and you are old,<note place="margin">6. And Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite answered, and said, I am young, and you are old, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I was afraid, and durst not show you my opinion.</note>

                  <l>I tell you no,—for I am confident,</l>
                  <l>There is a <hi>Spirit,</hi> which from Heaven is sent</l>
                  <l>Into our Breasts, by which we learn to know,</l>
                  <l>What all our toile, and labour here below</l>
                  <l>Cannot attain: for (to be plain with you)</l>
                  <l>I alwayes thought, but am confirmed now,</l>
                  <l>That <hi>wisdom is a spark of Divine flame,</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>A piercing glance of him whose hand did frame</l>
                  <l>The Universe: a most conspicuous sign</l>
                  <l>Of what we know, but cannot well define.</l>
                  <l>I think it one of those <hi>Coelestial Rayes,</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>Which neither doth consist in years, nor days:</l>
                  <l>A thing that is not in a <hi>Sanguine air,</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>Or a <hi>brisque Mine,</hi> though one would think that there</l>

                  <l>Which doth not yeeld the world much eloquence,</l>
