            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

VINDICATION
OF THE
CASE
OF
Indifferent Things,
USED
In the Worship of God.</head>
            <p>AMONGST some Tracts published with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the year for the resolution of such
doubts, as the Dissenters from our Church
plead for refusing Communion with it,
there was one that respected the use of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different
things in the Worship of God. This some one
of our Brethren chose to examine and to <hi>begin his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate
with;</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Case examined,</hi> p. 2.</note> in the management of which whether he
hath dealt <hi>closely and ingenuously</hi> to use his own words)<note place="margin">p. 16.</note>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:52407:3"/>
I shall take the liberty to enquire, and must leave o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
to judge.</p>
            <p>I confess I was not alittle surprized, that before he
had set one foot forward,<note place="margin">pag 2.</note> he should thus assault me,
<hi>If that</hi> R. <hi>person had been pleased to have determined
who is to be Judge of things Indifferent, as to a man</hi>'s
<hi>practice, whether his own conscience or his Superior</hi> &amp;c.
<hi>he would (in our opinion) have made the matter in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spute
much fitter for an argument, whereas the most Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senters
judge, that as he hath stated it, he hath but
beg'd the Question.</hi> If the dispute had been betwixt
Protestant and Papist, there might have been some co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
to have spent 4 pages in 40 upon this Argument;
though even betwixt such there may be 20 cases con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverted
in which this Demand would be impertinent:
But to put it upon this issue when both sides are in the
main agreed (as it is betwixt Protestant and Protestant)
is a running the Question out of its wits, and an hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<hi>begging it,</hi> before he puts it. It's to possess the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wary
Reader with prejudice, to puzle the cause, and
is the way to make every little Tract a Volume. In
matters of Controversy there are always some princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
supposed, and to put an Adversary upon the proof
of them, shews a design rather to cavil then to end
the dispute, and is a shrewd sign that the person so do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
is either diffident of his cause, or his own ability
to defend it; but to return his own complement, <hi>we
will not presume any thing so absurd</hi> or disingenuous <hi>of
so worthy a person.</hi>
               <note place="margin">p. 10.</note>
            </p>
            <p>But how remote soever this Question is to the busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
in hand, yet because our Author asks it with
some kind of seriousness, I shall direct him where he
may have satisfaction, and that in a Judicious Tract
lately published<note n="a" place="margin">The dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of the Case between the separation of Protestants from Rome, <hi>&amp;c. p. 42,</hi> &amp;c.</note>; or if he hath the patience to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
the things, as I have done, he may find it resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:52407:3"/>
by himself, in his <hi>Case examined.</hi>
               <note n="b" place="margin">p. 36, 37. n. 4. 38.</note> But in my
mind there is a much nearer way to end controversies,
which is not by disputing <hi>who shall be Judge?</hi> But by
enabling men to judge for themselves in a clear sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of the case, and setting sorth the nature of the
things disputed: As in the case before us, the ready
way, one should think, is to shew what is the nature of
Things Indifferent, and that things thus Indifferent
may be lawfully used in Divine Worship, and
because they may be abused, to enquire how we
are to apply them.</p>
            <p>This was the way I took, and if I did manage it as
it should, I am pretty confident that the <hi>Question was
not beg'd,</hi> though I never thought of coming near his
Question, <hi>who shall be the Judge?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But that is the thing to be disputed, Whether the
case was rightly stated and proved, and this brings me
to the consideration of what he hath offer'd against it.
Before I enter upon which,<note place="margin">Case of Indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent things.</note> I shall only remind the
Reader, that in the little Tract concerned in the present
dispute, the Question undertaken was;</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> Whether things in their own nature Indifferent, though
not prescribed in the Word of God, may be lawfully used
in Divine Worship?</p>
            <p>In answer to which;</p>
            <p>1. I enquired into the Nature, and stated the Notion
of Indifferent Things.</p>
            <p>2. Shew'd that Things Indifferent may be lawfully
used in Divine Worship.</p>
            <p>3. Considered how we might know what things are
Indifferent in the Worship of God.</p>
            <p>4. How we are to determine our selves in the use
of them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>To most of these our Author hath somewhat to say,
to some more to some less; but to the First, he saith,</hi> There
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:52407:4"/>
is none of the Dissenters, but agreeth with this Author
in his Notion of Things Indifferent,<note place="margin">p. 3.</note> that they are such
things as by the Divine Law are neither injoyned nor
forbidden.</p>
            <p>Now before I proceed I shall observe that this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession
of his will bereave them of some of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
and most considerable arguments that they use in
this controversie; As,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>If Things Indifferent are such as are neither injoyned
nor forbidden,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Conclus. 1.</note> it must follow that things are not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful
in Divine Worship because they are <hi>not comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The consequence is plain and undeniable: For if
the Nature of Things Indifferent be, as abovesaid,
<hi>what are neither commanded nor forbidden,</hi> there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
can make this or that to be unlawful but the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
forbidden: But now if the being <hi>not Commanded</hi>
is the same with the <hi>being Forbidden</hi> then the notion
of Indifferent Things cannot consist in this that they
are neither Commanded nor Forbidden. So that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they must quit the Argument, and grant that the
being not Commanded, doth not make a thing unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
in Divine Worship; or they must alter the notion
of Indifferent things, and indeed utterly exterminate
them, and leave no such middle things in nature, and
say that there is nothing else but Duty or Sin.</p>
            <p>Now after our Reverend Author hath so frankly
granted this, I cannot understand how he can say that
<hi>the doing of a thing in Gods Worship, not Commanded,
is guilt enough:</hi>
               <note place="margin">p. 25.</note> nor why he should take such pains to
oppose what I have offered in confutation of that prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple.
For what can he plead for the unlawfulness of
things <hi>not Commanded,</hi> who hath granted that the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>not Commanded</hi> is a branch of such things as are
Indifferent: And if he will maintain it, he must do it
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:52407:4"/>
upon no less absurdity, than the saying a thing Indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
is forbidden; or (which is the same) that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different
things, are such as are either forbidden, or
not forbidden.</p>
            <p>But let us abstract the Case of things <hi>not Commanded</hi>
from this consequence,<note place="margin">Case of Indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Things <hi>p. 20.</hi>
               </note> and take it as it is in the Tract
aforesaid, an Objection and Answer, and yet then we
shall see what an imperfect account our Author gives of
it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>He saith,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Case Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,</hi> p. 25.</note> What our Author saith is no more than hath
been many times said, <hi>viz.</hi> [that by things not Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
are meant things forbidden] and hath nothing to
prove it by, but only that the things mentioned in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
to which that phrase is applied were things for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden,
as Idolatry, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Though what he produceth out of the Case be suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient,
<note place="margin">Case of Indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Things, <hi>p. 20.</hi>
               </note> yet he extreamly forgets himself when he saith,
<hi>nothing, but only;</hi> since in the page he quotes, there
are two arguments, that are sooner flip'd than an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered.
But however what hath he to reply to that
which <hi>hath been many times said?</hi> He grants, <hi>It is
true.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And is this nothing toward the proof of it? What
fitter way have we to find out the meaning of a phrase,
than to consider the several places where it is used? Or
to ascertain the sense of it, than to shew that it's always
alike applied to such a case, or thing?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But in answer to this, he asks,</hi> Why are such things
express'd to us in this phrase, as, Not Commanded only?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>1st.</hi> I answer, they are not thus express'd, as, <hi>Not
commanded Only.</hi> For the things said to be <hi>not comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,</hi>
are either in their own nature, or in Scripture
absolutely Forbidden (as I have shewed, and he grants)
and therefore to limit the phrase, as if there was no
more intended in it than that the things are not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:52407:5"/>
(as the Word <hi>Only</hi> implies) and not also for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden
is to thwart Scripture, as well as my reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>2ly.</hi> If we take the Phrase as it is, yet there his
Question, <hi>Why are they thus express'd, and not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded?</hi>
is of no Importance; for supposing we could
give no Reason for such an use of it, that would not be
sufficient to question the Thing, as long as we find it
constantly so used and applied. But,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>3ly.</hi> Was there no Reason offer'd, no account given
of it? Let him peruse the Tract he opposeth, (as sure
he did) and he will find it expresly undertaken, and
two Reasons given for it;<note place="margin">Case of Indiff. Things. <hi>pag. 23.</hi>
               </note> as, 1. Things forbidden are
called <hi>not commanded,</hi> because <hi>all things prohibited are
by consequence not commanded, and not</hi> è contra. 2. <hi>It's
by way of Meiosis,</hi> &amp;c. But these, though to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
in hand, were not, I am afraid, to his.</p>
            <p>Well! Let us consider,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>4ly.</hi> What Account our Author himself gives at last
of this.</p>
            <p>1. Saith he, Things forbidden in Scripture are
said to be not commanded, <hi>To let us know the doing
of a thing not commanded in God's Worship, is Guilt
enough.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Case Indiff. Things. <hi>pag. 20.</hi>
               </note> Surely not so great, as to do a thing noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously
forbidden, (as I there shewed.) Surely it can
be no Guilt at all to do a thing not commanded, if
not also forbidden, because (as he owns) there are
Indifferent Things in the Worship of God; and what
are indifferent Things, but Things not commanded, as
well as not forbidden?</p>
            <p>2. <hi>He saith, it was so express'd, because</hi> the Guilt
of the Sin of Idolatry and Superstition lay in this, that
it was a thing not commanded: had God commanded
those things, they had been a true Worship, and accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:52407:5"/>
In which assertion of his, he grosly mistakes. First,
as to the nature of Idolatry and Superstition, when he
saith, <hi>the guilt of them lay in this, that they were things
not commanded:</hi> Whereas it is evident that they were
Sins, because forbidden. For what is Superstition but
the dreading of that which is not to be dreaded? (as the
<hi>Greek</hi> word shews;) Such as <hi>the Signs of Heaven,</hi>
Divinations, and Daemons, and even the unreasonable
and inordinate fear of God himself.<note place="margin">Jer. 10. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> When we fear
offending him, in what is not offensive to him. And
what is Idolatry but the giving Divine honour to that
which is not God, or prohibited honour to the true and
only God? These are things manifestly forbidden.</p>
            <p>Secondly, It's yet a grosser Error, which is contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the reason he gives for it, <hi>viz.</hi> That had God
Commanded those things, <hi>they had been a true Worship
and acceptable.</hi> An assertion, First, that confounds the
Nature of things, that makes Vice and Vertue alike, and
no otherwise discriminated but by Gods written Law,
as if Idolatry and Superstition were not Evil antecedent
to all Revelation, and which are so where Revelation is
not, as well as where it is.</p>
            <p>Secondly, From hence it follows that those things
may be acceptable to God, which in their own nature
do tend to drive Religion out of the World; and that
may be <hi>true Worship,</hi> which will unavoidably debase
the Deity in the thoughts of Mankind. For so do Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
and Superstition.</p>
            <p>As for the Instances he there takes notice of, I shall
reserve them to a more convenient place.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Conclus. 2.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Conclus.</note> If things Indifferent be such as are neither
Commanded nor Forbidden, and that things are not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful
because <hi>not Commanded,</hi> then things thus Indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
and not commanded are not additions to the Word
of God:<note place="margin">Case of Indiff. things. p. 24.</note> and the places usually insisted upon must be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:52407:6"/>
according to the sence I gave of them; and
which may serve as a sufficient reply to what he hath
said upon that Head.<note place="margin">Case examin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. p. 26.</note> But yet because he hath offer'd
somewhat in a nother place that looks like an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
I shall here consider it. He argues thus;</p>
            <p>If obedience be wanting the Salt is wanting to the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices
of our God,<note place="margin">Pag. 4.</note> which (as we humbly conceive) leaves no more
room for perfective than corruptive Additions to Divine
Worship <hi>&amp;c.</hi> What can be an act of Obedience to God but
what he hath commanded, whether he hath forbidden it
or no? If we bid our Servant go a mile, and he goeth
two (possibly hoping to do us Service in it) we hope his go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Second mile is no act of obedience, though we did not
forbid him. In matters of this Nature no act of Supereroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is allowable, because it can be no obedience. <hi>In answer
to which, it will be necessary to resolve this Question:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> Whether the doing of any thing in the Worship
of God without a command be a sinful addition to the
Word of God?</p>
            <p>I answer that if the Question is understood of the
proper and essential parts of Worship (if I may so speak)
then we grant it, and say, that he that shall institute a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thing in that kind without Divine Institution, <hi>doth
challenge Gods prerogative to himself;</hi> and because <hi>the
rule is sufficient, all such perfective are corruptive additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi>
(as he speaks) to both Rule and Worship. <hi>It is as if
a Servant when bidden to go a mile, he goeth two (possibly
hoping to do Service in it) for in matters of this nature
no Supererogation is allowable.</hi> Thus far his comparison
holds, as to matters of the same Nature, and design'd to
the same end: and esteemed to be of the same use. As
the going of two Miles for one, with an intent to do as
good Service, and be as well if not better approv'd for
so doing. But if the question be understood of such
things as are Adjuncts to Divine Worship, that are not
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:52407:6"/>
used upon the score of any of the reasons aforesaid, then
we are not to expect a command, nor do we Sin if we
act without it. As for example, a Servant is required
to go a Mile upon some service, and he useth a Coat or
a Cloak, takes an Horse or goes on Foot, puts a
string about his Finger to remember him of what he is
to do; Or if to carry a Message, considers what to say,
and Writes it down, that he may be the better fitted to
deliver it; In such cases his Master would think him
impertinent to ask Directions, and it's no Disobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
nor Supererogation to act, as he sees fit, without
them. And this is the case with us, as I shall afterward
shew. This said there is way made for the next inference.</p>
            <p>Conclus. 3. <hi>If things Indifferent are neither command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
nor forbidden,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Conclus. 3.</note> 
               <hi>and things are not unlawful because</hi>
not commanded, <hi>it follows that it's no Derogation from
the Sufficiency of Scripture to maintain the lawfulness
of using such things in Divine Worship, as are not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
commanded. It's somewhat a Specious way of arguing
which this Author useth,</hi> the Scriptures have determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
whatsoever may make us wise to Salvation,<note place="margin">p. 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

throughly furnished to all good Works. Now if the
Worship of God be a good work, and the right do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of it hath any tendency to make us perfect, they must
have a sufficiency to direct us in that. <hi>And he concludes,</hi>
If there be not a Rule for all things belonging to the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
of God (except as before excepted, <hi>&amp;c.)</hi> then the
Scriptures are not able to make us wise, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>By this way of arguing and a challenge he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
subjoyns, viz.</hi> If our Author can shew us any Act
of Worship, &amp;c. <hi>It may be thought he is a Champion for
the perfection and sufficiency of Scripture, and we the
derogators from it. And that without any more ado he
would have brought unanswerable arguments for that
kind of Scripture-sufficiency which we deny.</hi> If <hi>saith he,</hi>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:52407:7"/>
our <hi>R.</hi> Author can shew us any Act of Worship for the
performance of which in such a manner as God will accept,<note place="margin">Pag. 29.</note>
we cannot shew him direction of Scripture. <hi>Well! where is
it?</hi> Scripture, with the addition of such circumstances as
are naturally necessary to all Humane Actions, or evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
convenient for an action of a grave and weighty Nature,
for the obtaining the ends of it, or appearing to any Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Judgment to be so decent, that without them the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance
would be sordid. Scripture with the practice
of the first Guides of the Church; Scripture with the light
of Nature shining out in every reasonable Soul, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
with the exceptions before excepted,<note place="margin">pag. 21.</note> 
               <hi>in his Book.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Suppose then we put it to the question, Is Scripture a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone
a sufficient Rule for matters to be used in the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
of God? He readily answers, Yes. If you take in
the <hi>Nature of the thing, the light shining in every reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Soul;</hi> if you take in <hi>Common Judgment, convenience,
and decency;</hi> Lastly if you take in <hi>the practice of the first
Guides of the Church;</hi> that is, it is, and it is not. Now how
he hath all this while pleaded for that Sufficiency of
Scripture which we deny. And why he should so loudly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim
against <hi>all Supplements and Additions,</hi>
               <note place="margin">pag. 38.</note> 
               <hi>to that,</hi> and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
Reason and Authority, as a <hi>Supply:</hi> or what diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
he hath conceived betwixt <hi>Authority</hi> &amp; <hi>the Guides
of the Church;</hi> or betwixt <hi>Reason</hi> and <hi>the light of Nature
Shining out in every reasonable Soul,</hi>
               <note place="margin">pag. 29.</note> so as to deny to
the one what he grants to the other, I am not able to
understand? Yet for all this there must be a difference
betwixt him and us, and somewhat shall be said to make
it out. For <hi>the Sufficiency of Scripture, is a very great
argument.</hi>
               <note place="margin">pag. 28.</note> And so indeed it is; and it has been an old
argument against the practices of our Church, and is
not to be easily parted with: But yet what to give, and
what to take, and wherein the difference is betwixt
what we hold and he is forced to grant, he knows not,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:52407:7"/>
or has not been so kind as to discover.</p>
            <p>But however when all this is pastover, he concludes as
to one part, <hi>we cannot possibly agree with our R. Brother in
this thing, viz.</hi> That we have no such particular directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
for Worship under the Gospel as they had under the
Law<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>)<note place="margin">Case of indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> things. pag. 30.</note> This indeed I touched upon, to shew that the
faithfulness of Christ and sufficiency of Scripture consist
not in giving as particular directions for Worship as they
had under the Law; and in proof of this I set Baptism a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
Circumcision, the Lord's Supper against the Pass<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over,
and Prayers against Sacrifices.</p>
            <p>Now let us consider, what are the reasons why he
<hi>cannot possibly agree?</hi> Certainly if ever controversie was
like to be ended, we may now expect it because it's a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
plain matter of Fact. But in this case he strange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ls of performance: For whereas the deciding the
case depends upon the comparison betwixt the Law
and the Gospel, he doth not so much as offer any thing
about the latter. But let us consider what he saith of
the former, and as much as we can, make up his defect
in the latter.<note place="margin">pag. 31.</note> First, he saith, <hi>As to Circumcision, what par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
direction had the Jews? Their Rule extended no
further than to the Act and the time.</hi> Here I must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
there is nothing but the time that is determined;
But since there is nothing of that kind in Baptism pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed,
the Law is herein more particular than the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel.
2ly, As to the Passover, he acknowledges they had
a Rule, but then he adds<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>What Rule, had they to determine
them to a Kid or a Lamb?</hi> But was not that a Rule to
determine them, when it must be a Kid or a Lamb, and
no other Creature; and is not Two to all the Beasts in
the world a determination as well as one to two? But was
there nothing else <hi>determined?</hi> (as his cautious way of
expressing it would imply) Let him consult the Text,<note place="margin">Exod. 12. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </note> and
he will find that the Creature was not only thus to be one
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:52407:8"/>
out of two, but it was to be a Male, kept the 14th day,
and to be killed at even, without a bone broken, to be
roasted, to be eaten in the house, and with unleaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Bread with bitter Herbs, and none left to the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
And they were to eat it standing (as our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
acknowledges p. 32.) with their loyns girt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
And with several other rites too long to enumerate.</p>
            <p>But in the Lord's Supper, there is nothing specified
or required but the Elements, and the breaking and pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
out; nothing said of the kind of the Bread or Wine,
nothing required of the time or posture, or number, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for their Sacrifices,<note place="margin">pag 32.</note> he saith, <hi>the Rule was sufficient
and perfect, we hope, though one Jew brought a Bullock, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
a Goat,</hi> &amp;c. I may confidently say it was not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
if so they did, for God was pleas'd to require
more (who is the most competent Judge of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
of his own Law) For there was a particular
prescription not only as to the kinds of the Beasts, but
as to the disposing and ordering of them in Sacrifice,
what was to be eaten, and what not; whether the
bloud should be poured out or sprinkled, whether upon
the Altar or at the bottom of it, <hi>&amp;c,</hi> one would think
that a person that talks so loosely of these things, had
never read the Book of <hi>Leviticus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But now as to Prayers in the Christian Church, we
have only a general Form given us and direction to Pray
in the Name of Christ, but nothing as to Words, Time,
Posture, Company, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that what can be more manifest then that there is
no such particular direction given in Worship, as they had
under the law? And therefore however it comes to pass
that this Author hath here so bewildre'd himself, yet it's
what he hath granted before, when he was fain to make ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions,
as to things naturally necessary, <hi>&amp;c</hi> and of which
he saith in the beginning of this argument, that <hi>for such
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:52407:8"/>
it is impossible there should be a Rule;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Page. 8</note> though there, I
conceive, he hath as much erred on one side as he did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
on the other, when he saith <hi>it's impossible;</hi> for then
it had not been possible to assign time, posture, place, <hi>&amp;c,</hi>
under the Law. Had he said in some not possible, in
others not fit, he had been much more in the right:
However (to let that pass) in either way he grants
that there is no expectation of Scripture-Authority for
such things, nor doth the sufficiency of that or the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness
of Christ suffer by such an opinion.</p>
            <p>I suppose I may now close this Argument: For, as for
his <hi>Or's</hi> and, <hi>Alias's</hi> (which this Author so much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends
upon) I shall consider them in another place.</p>
            <p>Conclus. 4.<note place="margin">Conclus. 4.</note> 
               <hi>If things indifferent are neither command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
nor forbidden; and things are not unlawful because
not commanded, then the doing of such things as are
not commanded is not contrary to the second Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Case examined pag. 27</note> 
               <hi>The contrary to this is maintained by our Author,
who saith, that</hi> the doing of such things in Acts of external
Worship as are not commanded, is indeed a violation of the
second Commandment. <hi>For which he offers this reason,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
as in the 6th Commandment it is agreed, that all inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
to our neighbour's person is forbidden under the highest
species of such Acts: and in the 7th all species of uncleanness
are; so in the 2d commandment all errors in the matter of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
Worship are forbidden under the species of Idolatry.</p>
            <p>The answer to this depends upon the understanding
of his phrase, <hi>Matter of Worship,</hi> (which he hath given
us no light in) which either signifies parts of Worship,
and then we yield it, that all such instituted by men are
forbidden in this commandment, for it's false worship:
but then we deny that we are concern'd in it, or that any
thing <hi>not commanded</hi> and used by us is a part of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship.
And if he thinks otherwise he is (as upon other
reasons also) concern'd to take up the cause of Dr. <hi>Ames</hi>
that he saith, <hi>he is not concern'd in.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:52407:9"/>
If by <hi>matter of Worship</hi> he means the administration
and ordering of it,<note place="margin">Pag. 27.</note> then I deny the parallel, that all errors
in Matter of Worship areas much forbidden in the
second commandment, as injuries by the 6th, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For
injuries are of the same Species with Murder, and Acts
of uncleanness are of the same kind with Adultery; but
errors in the administration of Worship are nothing
akin to Idolatry.</p>
            <p>2. I deny that the doing of <hi>things not commanded</hi> in the
Matter of Worship are so much as <hi>errors</hi> in his sence,
since forbidden by no Law, as I have shewed.</p>
            <p>The Second point undertaken in <hi>the Case of Indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
Things</hi> was to shew,<note place="margin">Sect. 2. Case of Indiff. Things, <hi>p 4.</hi> &amp;c.</note> that there are things Indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
in the Worship of God, and that such things,

            <p>Of this,<note place="margin">

               <hi>saith our reverend Author,</hi> none (that we
know of) ever doubted; <hi>and again,</hi> as it's stated <hi>in that
Tract,</hi> none in his wits did ever deny it.</p>
            <p>I do not think my self obliged to answer for some
mens understandings; but if that be true, what must
we think of those whom Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> writes of, <hi>that

               <note place="margin">Defence of the principles of love, part 2. <hi>p. 97.</hi>
               </note> and adds, <hi>take heed of
them?</hi> What of such, that when they grant Things In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different
to be neither commanded nor forbidden, will
yet say, that things not commanded are forbidden?
What of such, that when they have granted (and so it's
then granted on both sides) that there are Things In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different
in the Worship of God,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Case examin'd</hi> p. 15.</note> will yet say, that <hi>the
Indifferency of actions to be done while they are employ'd
in the Worship of God is all the Question?</hi> Lastly, What
of those that when they have yielded that things Indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent,
though not prescribed, may be lawfully used in
Divine Worship, will have it put to the Question,
Whether things not necessary to all human actions
may be used in it? Who they are, or how far they are
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:52407:9"/>
concerned in the foregoing Character, I leave to this
Reverend persons Consideration.</p>
            <p>But although <hi>none in his Wits did ever deny</hi> the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
as stated by me, yet because it may be of use to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
the clearing of the matters hereafter to be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coursed
of, I will briefly consider the case as it was then
stated and that will appear from the things considered
in the state of it, and the ways taken to prove it.</p>
            <p>1. It was granted that things naturally necessary to
the Action were excluded; since generals act but
in their particulars; and if some of the kind must
accompany the Act, then this or that particular of the
kind is lawful to be used, as it is in time place, habit.
This he grants,<note place="margin">Pag. 7.</note> but only adds, that <hi>Habit surely is not
necessary, we read of none before the Fig-leaves were
sown together, Gen. 3.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But (1.) We indeed read of no habit before the Fall,
but is there nothing natural to man since the Fall?
What doth our Author think of the Apostle's <hi>Natural
Body,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Corinth. 15. 44.</note> &amp;c as opposed to Heavenly, or of the description
he gives of the state of mankind, when he saith, <hi>we
are by Nature Children of Wrath:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eph 2. 3.</note> We read of no
such Body or state before the time of the Fig-leaves.
And yet the Apostle makes bold to call them <hi>Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,</hi>
as belonging to man in his present fallen State.</p>
            <p>(2.) Therefore we have a further notion of <hi>Natural</hi>
given us, and that is when any thing is suted to the
Nature or State of the thing or person. Thus <hi>Ames</hi>
and others tell us of <hi>Natural Ceremonies,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Fres<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> p. 1. c. 4. <hi>&amp;. 5.</hi>
               </note> as lifting up
the eyes to Heaven in Sign of Devotion, (which by
the way is not so Natural;<note place="margin">Luke. 18. 13.</note> but that casting them down
in Worship is a sign of it too, as in the publicans.) And
so <hi>habit</hi> is Natural to man, as belonging and suted
to his present condition. But, saith he, it is not <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural,
for a person may Pray naked;</hi> and so he may
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:52407:10"/>
pray blindfold, and yet will any one say, sight is not
natural to man. But how may he pray naked in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
assemblies (for we are speaking of publick Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship)
can he say it's sutable to the Solemnity? And
so going naked is as little sutable to the nature of man.</p>
            <p>(3.) Again that's natural, which is the effect of
Nature, though not born with us. And I am apt
to think that did our Author live within the Circle of
the Frigid Zone, he would without any Tutor, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the knowledge of what is <hi>the custom of Civilized Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi>
without any moral reason, have thought upon
the benefit of Frieze, or somewhat of the like use with
that. But suppose I am mistaken, how hath he mended
the matter? He tells us, that <hi>by the custom of Civilized
Nations some habit is necessary.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 3. 21.</note> But then what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
of the Fig-leaves, what of the coats of Skins
God clothed <hi>Adam</hi> with. Now to say it came from
custom before custom was, (for it was in the beginning)
I think, is much more absurd than to say that Habit was
natural.</p>
            <p>But it's time to pass on to a more profitable argument.</p>
            <p>2. It was proved that all things, which in general
and for kind are morally necessary are also lawful in
their particulars. This was made evident from a parity
of reason 'twixt what is naturally, and what is morally
necessary, and therefore he that grants the particulars of
what is naturally necessary, to be indifferent, must also
grant the particulars of what is morally necessary to be
indifferent. And as it follows this Time or that, this Place
or that, this Habit or that is lawful and indifferent, because
Time, Place and Habit are necessary: So it also follows
this Method or that, this Form or that, this Order or
that is lawful, and may be used, because Method, Form,
and Order are necessary. And therefore we need look no
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:52407:10"/>
more for an institution for a Form,<note place="margin">Case examined pag. 18.</note> than, as he saith <hi>for a
Bell to call to Worship, or for a Gown or Cloak to preach
in,</hi> &amp;c. For what Naturally necessary is to the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars
of its kind, that is Morally necessary to its
particulars: And one is no more unlawful for want
of an institution or command, than the other. This
our Author also yields to,<note place="margin">Pag. 14.</note> 
               <hi>We,</hi> saith he, <hi>having agreed
that there are some circumstances of Humane actions, in Gods
Worship, not only Natural, common to all actions, but of a
Moral nature too, relating to them as such actions, which
God having neither commanded nor forbidden, may be
used, are not much concerned, in what our Author saith
upon his second Head.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. It was further shewed in the aforesaid Treatise, that
such things in Divine Worship as were agreeable to
the Rules of the Apostle, and served for Order, Decen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
and Edification, were also lawful, though they were
neither Naturally nor Morally necessary; nor did ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily
arise from the nature of the Thing, as Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod
and Form, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> do; that is, that there are a certain
sort of things that are ambulatory and contingent,<note place="margin">Case of indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent things p. 8, 12, 13.</note> that
vary with circumstances, ages, places, and conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> As, the being cover'd or uncover'd in
Worship; such and such fixed hours of Prayer; The
Love-feasts, and Holy-kiss, and besides, several Civil
usages transferr'd from secular affairs into the Service
of Religion; which were used therein not as meer Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
Rites; as I there shewed.</p>
            <p>This argument taken from Civil usages our Author
endeavours to avoid several ways.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>He saith,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Case examined. pag. 18.</note> If we do not mistake, the reason why
Dr. <hi>Ames</hi> and others do think that Civil usages may be
used in Acts of Worship, is because they are either ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to the action, as Humane, or convenient, comely
or grave, <hi>&amp;c. And because I had said</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Case of indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent things. pag. 14.</note> 
               <hi>that if the being</hi>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:52407:11"/>
Civil usages did make them lawful in Divine Worship,
then there is nothing in Civil cases but may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced
into the Church, though never so absurd, he
saith,<note place="margin">Case examined, pag. 19.</note> 
               <hi>he cannot apprehend the consequence,</hi> because
what is granted about Civil usages is to be applied to
grave actions and none other. But to this I answer,
Grant they are thus to be understood of such <hi>Civil usages</hi>
as are <hi>grave,</hi> yet then it is not so much because they
are Civil as because they are grave, that they may be
used, and provided that they were grave, they might
be used if they were not Civil, as well as if they were,
and are not the sooner to be used, because they are
Civil. And then what becomes of their argument for
such and such practices and customs that they were
Civil? And what have they got when to avoid the force
of what we say from the Love-Feasts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> plead, as he
doth, that they are <hi>Civil usages.</hi> So that when he and
his brethren grant,<note place="margin">Pag. 18.</note> 
               <hi>that such usages which may ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
be used in other Humane actions of a grave nature,
may be used in Acts of Worship</hi> (which is more than we
dare say; for then standing crosses may be introduced into
Worship, which are used to very grave purposes in Civil
matters, as to distinguish Christian from Heathenish or
Turkish Dominions, <hi>&amp;c.)</hi> I know not what they can
deny.</p>
            <p>2. He gives a very partial account of Civil usages,
when he tells us of <hi>Orators Pulpits,</hi> and <hi>Seats,</hi> and <hi>Bells,
Gowns and Cloaks:</hi> But in the mean while forgets that
there are Civil usages, that are of a Ceremonial Nature,
and that are used by way of signification, distinction, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
As now a garment is (I may still say) Naturally or
(as he will have it) Morally necessary, but when
in a particular case it's required that it be White
or Purple, it's a Civil usage, and is by way of significa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
and so the signification is transferr'd with it from
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:52407:11"/>
a civil to a sacred use, which how consistent it is with
their principles I leave it to his consideration.</p>
            <p>3. He takes no notice of the Argument used by me,
that if civil usages without institution may be lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
used in Divine Worship, this (with his concessions
before about Natural and Moral circumstances) will
justifie most, I had almost said, all the practices of our
Church, as I instanced in the Surplice, since White
was used as a badge of Royalty and Dignity, of joy
and innocency,<note place="margin">V. <hi>Brightman</hi> in <hi>Ames</hi> Fres<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Suit, part 2. p. 505, 510.</note> in Civil cases, and so may be used by
way of signification in Religious; and so of the rest.
All that he hath to say about the Surplice is, that <hi>it's
tied to Worship,</hi> which is remote from the case in hand,
and shall afterward be considered.</p>
            <p>To this I may also add the Cross<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which he saith,<note place="margin">Pag. 15.</note> 
               <hi>they
do not stumble of making upon a pack of Cloth or Stuff,
or upon a Sheep for note of distinction,</hi> and may be, and is
used for graver purposes in the like way of significa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in Civil matters as I have observ'd) and so may be,
by this Argument transfer'd into the Service of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</p>
            <p>4. It was further maintain'd in the stating of the Case,<note place="margin">Case of Indiff. Things, p. 5, 6.</note>
that the ordering and administration of the things rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
to Divine Worship, was left to Christian prudence.
To this our Author saith,<note place="margin">Case examined, p. 7.</note> 
               <hi>It is very true, these must be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
by human prudence, but that they must necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
be determined by the prudence of the Superiour,
and may not be determined by the prudence of the agents,
is another Question.</hi> Who ever affirmed it? That <hi>they
are left to human prudence to fix and determin,</hi> is all that
I maintain'd; but how far Superiours may determin, and
how far Inferiours must submit to things so determin'd,
is another Question, and belongs to another place.</p>
            <p>From what hath been said, it may appear whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>no man ever doubted</hi> of the truth of the Case as
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:52407:12"/>
I have stated it, when he himself speaks so dubiously
and uncertainly about it. But because I have not stated
it to his mind,<note place="margin">pag. 19.</note> and <hi>that it's not the Dissenters position,
but only a position, which their adversaries have imposed
upon them without any ground,</hi> as he saith; let us see how
he states the Question, which is thus:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> Whether things,<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> the doing, or not doing of which
God hath not prescribed, being neither necessary to the
action as an human action, nor convenient for it (with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
to those that perform it) for the ends of it, nor
naturally, nor in common judgment such, without which
it cannot be done decently, may be lawfully used in the
Worship of God by all persons, or by any persons, who
judge that God hath forbidden the part to which they are
by men determined, either in the letter, or by the just
reason, and consequence of Holy Writ, as forbidding all
useless and superfluous things, in so sacred actions, or
things not necessary, and used ordinarily in Idolatrous
and Superstitious services, or judging that in Worship
every man is <hi>sui juris,</hi> and ought not to be deprived of
the liberty God hath left him, may be universally and
lawfully used?</p>
            <p>This he hath elsewhere formed into a position,<note place="margin">pag. 23, 24.</note> and
from thence doth declare, that it lies upon his Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
to prove, <hi>that those things which he would have all
Dissenters conform to are,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. Things naturally necessary to all human Acts. Or,</p>
            <p>2. Things convenient for them as human acts. Or, with
reference to the true end of such acts: Or,</p>
            <p>3. Such as Nature shews to be comely for all human acts,
or such grave acts at least, or which common judgment so
judgeth. Or,</p>
            <p>4. That men may do what they reasonably judge sinful. Or,</p>
            <p>5. That there is no reason to judge useless, and super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous
actions in the Worship of God sinful. Or,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:52407:12"/>
6. No reason so to judge of the things not necessary to
be used in Gods Worship, and which have been, and are
ordinarily used in Idolatrous Worship. Or,</p>
            <p>7. That there is no reason to judge, that Christians in
matters of Worship ought to be left at liberty in things
when God hath so left them.</p>
            <p>Whether this be <hi>indeed</hi> the Dissenters <hi>position</hi> he best
understands (as I should think but whether it be their
position <hi>explained,</hi>
               <note place="margin">pag. 19.</note> (as he saith) or confounded,<note place="margin">pag 24.</note> I leave
to the judgment of others. This only I am sure of, that
for as much as I can understand of it, I may turn his
own words upon him, and whereas he saith of the Case
as I have stated it, <hi>None in his wits did ever deny it,</hi> I
can say as it's stated by him, <hi>None in his wits</hi> did ever
affirm it. For who <hi>in his wits</hi> will ever affirm that it's
lawful to use such things in the Worship of God, that
are sordid and indecent, disorderly and confused, idle,
useless, and superfluous, hurtful and pernicious?</p>
            <p>And yet (according to him) this must he do, that will
undertake to prove, that things that are not comely,
convenient, or edifying, may be admitted thereinto.
For this Author tells us,<note place="margin">pag. 11.</note> that <hi>by Decency we can under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
nothing but what is oppos'd to sordidly,</hi> &amp;c. And if
it be not decent by his rule, it must be sordid: And so
of the rest.</p>
            <p>Again, Who <hi>in his wits</hi> will affirm that <hi>men may do
what they reasonably judge sinful?</hi> And yet these things
must they affirm that will attack this position of our
Authors: By which stating of the Question and ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
things of a different nature together, he hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
well for his own security, and may without fear
of being conquer'd,<note place="margin">pag. 25.</note> or so much as oppos'd, fling down
the Gantlet, with, <hi>If our</hi> R. <hi>Author hath taken the
position, as here stated, and argued it, we shall consider
what he hath said; if not, we shall lightly pass over what
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:52407:13"/>
he hath said,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and expect till he hath justified all
or any of the last Seven mentioned particulars.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I shall not <hi>so lightly pass over</hi> what he hath said
without clearing what may be cleared, and reducing
the Case into its proper principles, though it be what he
hath taken no care to explain or prove.</p>
            <p>If we review his seven particulars, we shall find that
the<note n="a" place="margin">V. case of a scrupulous Conscience, Dr. Calamy's Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon on that subject.</note> 4th. and 6th.<note n="b" place="margin">the case of Symbolizing, and the defence.</note> belong not to this case,
and are otherwhere resolved: And of the Five remaining
Four of them are reducible to one argument, which come
now to be considered; and the last <hi>of Christian Liberty,</hi>
I shall treat upon in the close of this Discourse.</p>
            <p>In treating upon the Four that belong to one argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and have for their subject <hi>Human Acts;</hi> I think
it may be done by putting and resolving the following
Question.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> What is it that doth make things in themselves law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
and indifferent, to be unlawful in Divine Worship?</p>
            <p>This is the main seat of the controversie; it being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed
that there are indifferent things in the Worship
of God; But since we afterward divide upon it and say
that notwithstanding this there are some things of that
nature, that are by circumstance unlawful, it is sit to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand,
how this Question is resolved by one and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>If We state the case, we say the Rules we are to guide
our selves by, are those of the Apostle, of Decency, Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
and Edification. And we trouble not our selves
nicely to consider whether the Decency arise from the
nature of the thing, or from common usage, or prescrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
or institution, since we think that decency may
arise from any, and it matters not from what cause
the thing proceeds, nor how it came to be Decent, when
it's now thought and found to be so. And as little
curious arewe about the first reasons of Order and Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:52407:13"/>
for we are so little speculative in matters of
practice, that we think the peace of the Church, and
Unity amongst Christians, are much more fit to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine
us in these cases than all the accuracy in
Metaphysicks.</p>
            <p>So that if a thing be found to be decent, orderly and
for Edification, though we were assur'd it did Spring
from Humane Institution, we think it to be lawful, and
that Humane Institution cannot make that unlawful;
which is found by use and experience to be for De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency
and Order.</p>
            <p>Again we think that those things which in kind are
necessary to Humane Acts in all cases, and comely
and grave in Worship as well as out of it, may be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriated
to Worship: and that the appropriation of
Places, Time and Habit to Worship, doth not therefore
make such Places, Times, and Habits, unlawful to be u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed.</p>
            <p>And if things indifferent in themselves are unlawful
in Worship, we conclude it must be when Divine In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution
is pretended for what is Humane, and when
the things sute not the Nature,<note place="margin">Case of indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent things. <hi>p. 24,</hi> &amp;c.</note> or defeat the ends
of Divine Worship; or for the like reasons which
I in the controverted Tract did insist upon.</p>
            <p>But now on the contrary, by what may be Collect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from him, it appears to be the Sence of his posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</p>
            <p>1. That nothing of Humane Institution is to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
or may lawfully be used in Divine Worship. For
thus he saith, they must be <hi>things necessary to all Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Acts, or convenient for them as Humane Acts,
or comely for all Humane Acts,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>2. That nothing, though nccessary, or convenient,
or comely, ought to be used in, and much less be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriated
to the Worship of God; for they are to be
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:52407:14"/>
considered in Worship only as they have a reference to
such <hi>Humane Acts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the consideration of these I shall</p>
            <p>1. Consider how he attempts to prove it.</p>
            <p>2. Endeavour to discover the mistake; and vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
the arguments and instances, produced in <hi>the case
of Indifferent things</hi> to the contrary, from his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions.</p>
            <p>These are the chief things that all his discourse is
founded upon, and that are scattered through it: But
<hi>though</hi> they are rather supposed than proved by him;
and therefore (to use his own Words) <hi>I may lightly
pass them over, and expect till he hath justified them:</hi>
yet because I would make somewhat of it, I shall col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
from the Hints he gives, what it is that he doth
think may be said for them.</p>
            <p>As for the first of these,<note place="margin">Prop. 1.</note> that <hi>nothing is to be used in
Divine Worship that is meerly of Humane Institution,</hi>
his arguments are fetched from the Nature of the
things pleaded for them, <hi>viz.</hi> Decency, order, edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.
As, saith he,</p>
            <p>1. <hi>We cannot apprehend it in the power of Man to
Create a Decency.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pag 11.</note> 
               <hi>The greatest Emperors wearing an
Antick Habit, would not make it Decent, till it could
prescribe, or had obtained a common consent.</hi> This I
the rather mention, because it is an argument much in
vogue amongst those that would artificially handle
this matter. But here let me ask them what it is cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates
a Decency? He saith, <hi>the Law of Nature</hi> and <hi>prescrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
common consent and the guise of Countries.</hi> But how
began that <hi>Prescription,</hi> whence arose that <hi>consent</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
from chance or institution? Or what is it whence it
ariseth, if it be found to be decent? Certainly if it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
in one of these <hi>institution</hi> is the more noble of the
two, and the less disputable: And then it would be hard
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:52407:14"/>
to conceive how that which came by chance should be
lawful, and that which came by Institution should be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful.</p>
            <p>But (2.) If <hi>Prescription,</hi> and <hi>Common Consent,</hi> and <hi>the
Guise of Countreys</hi> be the measure of Decency, may not
these things also be the measure of it in the Church,
and in things relating to Divine Worship? And is not
<hi>the custom of the Churches of God</hi> a reason as sufficient to
conclude us in this matter as the grave and Civil customs
of a Nation? Or (3.) Is there any Church on this side
<hi>Rome</hi> that by a <hi>Sic volo</hi> doth stamp a decency upon its
Institutions, without respect to prescription and the
custom of Churches? Or that can do it? By his way
of expressing himself, he would make the Argument
great, as if to <hi>Create a Decency</hi> was an invasion of God's
Prerogative; <hi>We cannot apprehend it in the Power of
man to Create a Decency. The greatest Emperor,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>But if a Decency arise from <hi>the Guise of Countrys, and
Prescription, and Common Consent,</hi> it might be questio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
whether according to him, God himself can then
<hi>Create a Decency,</hi> and by his authority make that to be
at once which requires time and Custom (as he saith)
to produce and form it? So high doth the power of
a little School-subtilty and Imagination sometimes trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
men, that their Arguments vanish out of sight,
and are lost to all those that converse with what is gross
and tangible.</p>
            <p>But supposing <hi>it is not in the power of man to Create
a Decency,</hi> yet Order may be Order without those
dilatory reasons of Custom and Prescription; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
what holds against establishing Decency by insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution,
will not hinder but that order may be thereby
established. Therefore,</p>
            <p>2. <hi>He further argues from the Nature of Decency and
Order, that things of meer Humane Institution are not
capable of that plea.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> We can understand, <hi>saith he,</hi> no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:52407:15"/>
by orderly, and according to order, but without
confusion. By Decency we can understand nothing but
what is opposed to sordidly; nor can we think of any acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that is not Decent, if the contrary to it be not indecent. So
then nothing ought to be done in the Worship of God, but
what may be done without Confusion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of which Nature
can nothing be that is idle and superfluous, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I was at a great loss at first to find out the drist of
all this, but upon consideration I think it contains
these things: (1.) That it is unlawful to ordain or use
any thing superfluous in the Worship of God. (2.)
That whatsoever is not for Order, Decency and Edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
is superfluous. (3.) That nothing is Decent, if
the contrary to it be not indecent. It's the last of these
we are now concerned in; which by the help of the
great managers of this Argument,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ames</hi>'s Fresh Suit, &amp; answer to Bp. <hi>Morton. Jean's</hi> Unifor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity in answer to Dr. <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond.</hi>
               </note> may be better un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood.
And it amounts to this, that Decency and
Indecency are contraries (rather privatives saith <hi>Jeans)</hi>
And if one of them be not Indecent, the other can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be Decent: And if the Action may be performed
decently without what is called Decent, then that
which we call so is not Decent. As suppose it's pleaded
that a Surplice is Decent, but if the contrary be not
Indecent, and the Service may be performed de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently
without it, then that Vestment is not Decent.</p>
            <p>In answer to which I shall not concern my self
in a tedious and nice dispute about the nature of
Contrarieties and Privatives, but readily grant the
opposition which they insist upon betwixt Decent
and Indecent; And yet notwithstanding shall make
bold to deny the whole they infer from it: And
that for this reason, because our Dispute is not about
the Nature of Decency and Indecency, but about things
Decent and Indecent: And although Decency and
Indecency be opposed as above said, yet it is not so
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:52407:15"/>
in the things controverted, but that things different
may be both of them, Decent.</p>
            <p>As for Example, he grants that <hi>it's comely and grave
to preach in a Gown,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pag. 18.</note> and that they look therefore for
no Institution; but now by this way of arguing it
could not be so: For if a person may preach decent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
without a Gown, then it cannot be Decent to
preach with it, because Decency and Indecency are
contraries, and if the contrary be not Indecent, (as
it is not to preach without it, must he say,) then
to preach with it is not Decent.</p>
            <p>So again, what Decency is to Indecency, that is
Reverence to Irreverence: But, he saith, that kneel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at the Sacrament is Decent,<note place="margin">Pag. 36.</note> (for saith he, <hi>no
Dissenter refuseth to receive the Sacrament kneeling
because it is not Decent)</hi> and <hi>Reverent.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pag. 13.</note> But it can
be neither of these by his argument, for they also
affirm that it may be Decently and Reverently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,
though they do not kneel; and therefore the
contrary to kneeling being not Indecent, kneeling
cannot be Decent. And thus I might run on <hi>in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitum;</hi>
and the like may be argued from the account
he gives of Order.</p>
            <p>The ground of his and the others mistake is, that
they argue from the kind to the individuals of the
kind, as if one individual was as much opposite to
the other as kind to kind, whereas the individuals
are mutable things, which the guise of Countrys, and
custom, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> alter; and two things different in use
or figure, or the like, may be both of them Decent,
as to wear a Cloak or a Coat in Secular business; a
Cloak, Gown, or Surplice in Religious Solemnities,
(according as the custom is.)</p>

            <p>After all this pert discourse against things instituted
we are little concern'd, not only because there is
nothing like things meerly instituted by men in our
Church except the Cross, (which Lay-Communion
is not concerned in) but also because even that and
all things that can be forced to look this way are not
now instituting, but are received as having been so
long before, and are not the subject matter of
Institution, but of Civil and Ecclesiastical Command
betwixt which there is a vast difference,<note place="margin">Against Dr. <hi>Hammond.</hi> pag. 80.</note> as, Mr. <hi>Jeans</hi>
rightly observes; <hi>There is difference 'twixt Institution,
and Commandment or Appointment; for though every
Institution be a Commandment or Appointment, yet every
Commandment or Appointment is not an Institution. And
hence a Church in a place may command and appoint the
uniform observance of Ceremonies, instituted unto its
hand by the Church in former ages.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for such particular things as were owing to meer
Institution (which I produced in the above said tract)
in respect of their use and signification, I shall keep
them in my eye, though I lay them a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Nothing,<note place="margin">Prop. 2.</note> though necessary, or convenient, or
comely, ought to be used in, and much less appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priated
to the Worship of God; being all such things
are to be considered therein only as they have a refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
to <hi>humane acts.</hi> This he asserts not only in
the Propositions which he draws from his general po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:52407:16"/>
but also elsewhere; so he saith, that they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
with <hi>meer necessary,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pag. 23.</note> 
               <hi>or convenient circumstances
either of Actions, or such or such Actions, considered
abstractly from any Religion.</hi> And therefore he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes.</p>
            <p>1. They must not be used in Religious Worship.
So he saith,<note place="margin">Pag. 15.</note> 
               <hi>Those who stumble at the Surplice (as not
many do) or the Cross, or kneeling at the Eucharist,
scruple to do it in an Act of Worship.</hi> So again, <hi>The
Minister must wear his Surplice in his Acts of Worship,
and sign with the Cross within the complex Act of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
(for he after it with prayers concludes the Action.)
The People must kneel in the act of Receiving.</hi> What
then? Why then they are unlawful Now how the
things that are necessary in general (as Posture, Habit,
<hi>&amp;c.)</hi> can be used without particulars, or how those
particulars can be used in Worship lawfully, and yet
be unlawful, because used in Worship, I understand
not. For then sitting would be unlawful, if alike re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired,
and a Gown be unlawful, and the Ring in Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
unlawful, and the laying the hand on the Book
unlawful, (at the former of which is a prayer annexed,
and at the latter it is implied,) and all Civil Usages in
Worship would be unlawful: And then what will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
of what he hath elsewhere said? Dr. <hi>Ames and
others do think that such usages which may ordinarily
be used in other humane actions of a grave nature,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pag. 18.</note> 
               <hi>may
be used in Acts of Worship; and being so used are no
more than appendants to the Action,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>But being sensible that this will not do, and that
unless he can make the <hi>being used in Worship</hi> to be
the same with Worship, to be an act or a part of it,
he cannot make it unlawful, and that if he should
attempt it, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">

               </gap> to disparage the cause,

2. That which is appropriated to Worship is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful.
<note place="margin">Pag. 12.</note> 
               <hi>Some of them cannot but look for an Institution
for a Garment</hi> [meaning the Surplice] <hi>which they must
be tied to use in the Worship of God, and restrained from
the wearing of at other times.</hi> Now because this would
open a gap too wide for him to stand in, and would
condemn Places, as well as Habits, and make it as
unlawful to use a Church as a Surplice, he therefore
cautiously begins it with <hi>Some of them:</hi> But yet how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
he gives us a reason for it, <hi>viz. Because the appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priation
of it to the Religious act, speaks something of
Religion and Homage to God in it.</hi> Elsewhere he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presseth
himself after the like manner, <hi>We think they</hi>
(civil usages) <hi>must not have any thing of the nature of
Worship in them, but may as well be used in meerly Civil
actions, as in Religious Duties. If there be any thing of
Homage to God in them they are Worship which must
have an Institution.</hi> But, First, What doth he mean
by <hi>appropriation,</hi> doth he thereby understand that
what is for the present appropriated to a Religious use
and Service cannot be omited, nor altered, nor upon
any reason whatsoever be applied to any other use?
This our Church doth not hold.<note n="a" place="margin">Homilies Sermon of good works pt. 2 Sermon of Prayer. pt. 2. Article. 34.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Is it that out of a Reverence to Divine Ordinances,
it is not fit that the things used in or at Divine Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
be prostituted to vulgar use, that what are Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
for an hour or two on the Lord's day be not Stables
all the week after; nor the Tables and Plate used in
the Lord's Super, be employd, in the service of the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns?
This we agree to, and think our selves well able to
defend against any arguments we have yet seen to the
contrary. <hi>2ly.</hi> Doth appropriation necessarily imploy
<hi>homage</hi> to God; may not things be thus separated,
for Order and Uniformity, for Gravity and Decency, for
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:52407:17"/>
Reverence and Respect to the Solemnities of Religion?
And may not this Reverence and Respect we shew to
the solemnities of Religion, and the Devotion we shew
in external Worship redound to God himself?</p>
            <p>Indeed what are all the outward acts of Reverence
but expressing of Homage, Veneration and Adoration to
God? I do not think the Holy Psalmist forgot himself
when he said,<note place="margin">Ps. 95. 6.</note> 
               <hi>Come let us Worship, and fall down, and
kneel before the Lord our Maker:</hi> Or that our Author
himself said amiss,<note place="margin">Pag. 29.</note> when he maintains, that <hi>Nature
teacheth us to Worship God in the most decent manner we
can.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pag. 13. &amp;. <hi>Jean's</hi> answer to <hi>Hammond.</hi>
               </note> For though <hi>Adoration</hi> be to be given to God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone,<note place="margin">Pag. 21.</note>
yet <hi>Reverence</hi> (as our Author distinguisheth)
is due to all things relating to him, and to that Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
we pay to him: And as there are several Acts of
Worship due to God; So there are some things due
to his Worship, by which his honour is advanced and
devotion furthered.<note place="margin">Case of Indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent things. Pag. 29.</note> But for this I refer him to what
was said otherwhere, which he was pleased to take
no notice of.</p>
            <p>But to bring all to an issue I shall now consider the
several arguments, and instances I produced to prove
that <hi>things indifferent, though not prescribed, may be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
used in Divine Worship.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This I proved from the old Testament and New,
from the practice of the Primitive and Modern Churches,
and from their own Concessions.</p>
            <p>1. The instances I chose to give from the Old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
were <hi>David's</hi> Temple, the Feast of Purim, and
the Synagogal Worship: To these he answers at once,
that <hi>they are answered long since by Dr.</hi> Ames <hi>in his
Fresh Suit.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Case examinea. Pag. 25.</note> And perhaps may be answered by him af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the manner he defended the objection taken from
the second Commandment,<note place="margin">Pag. 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> which our Author himself
gives up: But if his Arguments are of force, I suppose,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:52407:18"/>
we shall find it in our Author. And he first begins with
<hi>Davids</hi> Temple,<note place="margin">Pag. 26.</note> of which he saith, <hi>David indeed de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign'd
a Temple for God without a command, But God check<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him for it for this very reason, 2. Sam. 7. 7. and
though he approved his generally good intention, yet he
restrained him as to his Act, as may be seen in that Chap.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This being matter of Fact the Text must determine it,
and from thence I observe.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>That God had at no time given a command con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
building a Temple. So in the Text quoted,</hi>
in all the places with all the children of Israel spake I a
word with any of the tribes,<note place="margin">2 Sam. 7. 7.</note> 
               <hi>&amp;c.</hi> saying, why build ye
not me an house of Cedars?</p>
            <p>2. <hi>David</hi> in designing it went upon rational grounds
(1.) as God had <hi>given him rest,</hi> and so it became him
to do it in point of gratitude, and because he had an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
for it.<note place="margin">Vers. 1</note> (2.) From comparing his own house
with God's, <hi>See now I dwell in an house of Cedar, but the
Ark of God dwelleth within curtains.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. It was no rash act,<note place="margin">Vers. 2.</note> for it seems he had at that time
<hi>made ready for the building,</hi> having it a long time before
in his thoughts.<note place="margin">1 Chron. 28. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. 3.</note> Or this see Dr. <hi>Lightfoot, Temple</hi> c. 40.</p>
            <p>1. From all which I infer, that neither <hi>David</hi> in design<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
nor <hi>Nathan</hi> in approving what he design'd, thought
it absolutely unlawful to do what was <hi>not commanded</hi>
in the Worship of God, or that what was not command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
was forbidden. This must be granted by our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor,
that saith, <hi>God approved his generally good intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
now what was his intention generally but to do
somewhat in honour to God, and for the solemnity of
his Worship? Thus much Mr. <hi>Pool</hi> doth yield, <hi>The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
being pious, and the thing not forbidden by God,</hi> Nathan
<hi>hastily approves it.</hi> Now if he approved it <hi>because not
forbidden by God,</hi> then they did not think that what
was not commanded, was forbidden; nor doth that of
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:52407:18"/>
our Author appear to be reasonable, that <hi>God checked
him for it, because it was without a command.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>2ly.</hi> Supposing that particular Act condemned, yet it
is not reasonable to suppose it to be for the general rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
given by our Author, that <hi>nothing must be done
without a command,</hi> but because in a matter of that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence,
the Prophet did not advise about it, and that
he did <hi>too hastily approve it,</hi> as Mr. <hi>Pool</hi> saith.
But,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>3ly.</hi> It's evident that the particular Act was not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned.
1. Because God commended him for it, <hi>thou
didst well</hi>
               <note n="a" place="margin">1 Kings<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 8. 17, 18.</note>. So Mr. <hi>Hildersham, Though the Lord
would not let</hi> David <hi>build him an House, yet he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends
his affection for it,</hi> &amp;c.<note n="b" place="margin">Laect. on Job. Lect. 28.</note> 2. God rewarded him
for it, for upon it it was promised,<note n="c" place="margin">2 Sam. 7. 11.</note> 
               <hi>He will make
thee an House.</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Chron. 17. 10.</note> So Mr. <hi>Pool, For thy good intentions to
make him an House, he will build thee an House.</hi>
3. He presently gave order upon it for the building
such an House; and as a mark of approbation, and a
further reward of <hi>David</hi>'s good intention, did both
reveal what he would have built, and how<note n="d" place="margin">1 Chron. 28. 19.</note>; And
appoint his immediate Successor for the building of it
<note n="e" place="margin">2 Sam. 7. 13<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note>. 4. Though God did deny this Privilege to <hi>David,</hi>
yet it was not without giving him good reason for it,
and that was (1.) because things were not setled.
So it was before with the tribes, therefore God saith
<hi>he walked with them</hi>
               <note n="f" place="margin">2 Sam. 7. 6, 7. vers. 1.</note>: And so it was with <hi>David,</hi>
for though he had at that time <hi>rest,</hi> (which was
about the <hi>10th,</hi> or at most the <hi>20th,</hi> of his Reign;)
Yet it was far from a settled Peace, and therefore
Mr. <hi>Pool</hi> reads it as the Margin, <hi>v. 11. I will cause
thee to rest.</hi> (2.) It was not fit for <hi>David, Because
he had been a man of War, and shed much blood.</hi>
               <note n="g" place="margin">1 Chron. 22. 7, 8, 9. 28, 3.</note> Now
in opposition to this (1.) God saith, <hi>I will ordain a
place for Israel, and plant them,</hi> &amp;c.<note n="h" place="margin">1 Chron. 17. 9</note> (2.) Of <hi>Solomon,</hi>
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:52407:19"/>
he saith, <hi>He shall be a man of rest, and I will give
him Peace</hi>
               <note n="i" place="margin">1 Chron. 22. 9</note>.</p>
            <p>So that it appears that it was not unlawful for
<hi>David</hi> to design a Temple nor unacceptable to God
that he did design it, but it was deferr'd for the reasons
before given, and because it was unseasonable.</p>
            <p>Now because the Author has referr'd me to <hi>Ames,</hi>
I will send him back thither, and let him see whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he has answered all this or no.<note place="margin">

            <p>
               <hi>As for the</hi> Feast of Purim, <hi>This Reverend person
saith,</hi> It lieth upon our Author to prove, the Feast of
purim was kept as a Religious Feast. There is no order
for any Religious Acts to be performed in it. If it were,
it was generally commanded under the precepts of giving
thanks for publick mercies.</p>
            <p>I shall therefore undertake to prove it a Religious
Feast. But before I proceed I shall 1. observe, That the
lawfulness of Religious Feasts and Fasts admit of the
same general proof, and if I prove one I prove the
other. 2. I observe that the <hi>Jews</hi> did think it lawful
to institute Religious Feasts and Fasts, both occasional
and anniversary. Of the latter sort (which is the
matter in dispute) were the Fasts of the <hi>4th, 5th</hi> and
<hi>10th</hi> Months, instituted in the time of the Captivity<note n="a" place="margin">Zech. 8. 19.</note>.</p>
            <p>Such was the Feast of Dedication instituted by the
<hi>Jews</hi> in the time of the <hi>Maccabees</hi>
               <note n="b" place="margin">1 Mac. 4<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 59.</note>, And kept to the
time of our Saviour<note n="c" place="margin">John 10, 22.</note>, nay to this very day amongst
them<note n="d" place="margin">Euxtorf. Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nag. Jud.</note>. And so <hi>Mordecai</hi> and <hi>Esther</hi> did establish this
Feast of Purim, and the <hi>Jews took upon themselves
to keep it</hi>
               <note n="e" place="margin">Est. 9, 20, 27, 29.</note>. Now that it was a Religious Feast will
appear,</p>
            <p>1. <hi>As it was a day of thanksgiving to God for
that great deliverance. Thus it's called</hi> a day of glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
a good day<note n="f" place="margin">C. 8. 17. 9. 18, 19, 22.</note>, <hi>which Mr.</hi> Pool <hi>thus paraphraseth,</hi>
a time of feasting, rejoycing and thanksgiving<note n="g" place="margin">On c. 8. 17. Ch. 9. 27.</note>. <hi>This
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:52407:19"/>
further appears from the reason given for the celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of it.</hi> It was, <hi>saith the Text,</hi> That the memorial
of their deliverance should not perish: <hi>or as Mr.</hi> Pool,
Because they had seen and felt this wonderful work of
God on their behalf.<note n="h" place="margin">C. 9. 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

               <hi>It appear'd further from the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances
of it, it's said</hi> They sent portions one to
another, and gifts to the poor.<note n="i" place="margin">C. 9, 22.</note> Which, <hi>saith</hi> Pool, they
used to give upon days of thanksgiving, of which see
<hi>Neh. 8. 10.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And I may add, that it is impossible to conceive
that persons of such signal piety as <hi>Mordecai</hi> and <hi>Est<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>her,</hi>
should institute, and under the present sense of
such a deliverance, as the <hi>Jews</hi> were, should observe this
Feast, only as a day of Civil Joy, without respect to
God that wonderfully brought it about.</p>
            <p>2. It was as much a Religious Feast, as their Fast was a
Religious Fast; So the Text makes them parallel, <hi>They con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
these days of Purim,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>As they had decreed for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
&amp; for their seed the matters of the fastings &amp; their
cry.</hi>
               <note n="k" place="margin">C. 10, 31.</note> But what their Fasting was, the nature of the
thing, as well as the <hi>Cry</hi> here spoken of doth declare.
So to <hi>go ye and fast, Pool</hi> adds, <hi>and pray, which was
the main business, to which fasting was only an help.</hi>
               <note n="l" place="margin">On. c. 4. 16, and 9, 31.</note>
But our Author saith; <hi>There is no order for any Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
Acts to be performed in it.</hi> As if they did not
know what became them to do upon such a gracious
and wonderful deliverance. But we read of no order
for such Acts on their days of Fasting, were they
not therefore Religious? Nay we read not of the name
of God in the whole Book, or or any duty to him
plainly expressed, and shall we therefore esteem it not
to be Religious and Canonical?</p>
            <p>But saith our Author, <hi>If it were a Religious Feast,
it was generally commanded under the precepts of giving
thanks.</hi> And I desire no more: For in one Breath he
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:52407:20"/>
hath yielded all. So that now we have gained, that
fixed and anniversary festival days set apart for Comme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moration
of God's Mercies to us, are not only lawful, but
what we have a command for. And thence it follows,
that a Church hath Power to determine them, as they
did. And further that <hi>things not commanded</hi> may be
used in Divine Worship.</p>
            <p>The next thing is the Synagogal Worship.</p>
            <p>To this he replyes, <hi>The Worshipping of God in Synagogues
wanted no special Command; Being but a Circumstance
convenient, if not necessary to publick Worship considered
as an Humane Act. A Multitude of people could not meet
to Worship God together without a fit place.</hi> But First
why did not Synagogues want <hi>a Special Command</hi> as
well as the Temple which he contends for?) For, which
is worse, to build a more convenient place for one already
instituted, a Temple for a Tabernacle; or to build pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
for which they had (as he yields) <hi>no special com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,</hi>
as the Synagogues? But suppose they needed not
a Command for Synagogues, <hi>because a Multitude could
not meet together without a Fit Place;</hi> yet how will
that be a reason that <hi>the Worshipping in Synagogues
wanted it not?</hi> That place is <hi>a circumstance convenient,</hi>
and that <hi>Synagogues were fit places for a Multitude of
people to Worship in,</hi> we grant; and we will grant that
this may be a reason to justify the building and using
such places <hi>without a special Command;</hi> yet what is that
to the Worship so and so ordered in those places? What
is that to Days and Hours, which the Scripture speaks
of, and he contends against? What is this to the Forms
used in their Service, which the Jews do write of?,
If these are not to be justified though they wanted a
Special Command, how was it that our Blessed Saviour
and his Apostles did not only frequent the places,
but the Service, as our Saviour's Customary Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:52407:20"/>
in them doth shew? What is this to the Ritual
Observations our Saviour complied with, such as the
Passover Cup, and their posture at it, which he shewed his
approbation of in his taking the materials of his last Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
from the Rites used in the Passover, <hi>as</hi> learned men
have observed; of which <hi>Casaubon</hi> saith, <hi>Hoc primum
observare juvat, quomodo Filius Dei umbras Legis ad
veritatem traduxerit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>This he will by no means hear of, and therefore useth
several evasions (for they are no better). Thus when
it's recorded that our Saviour told the disciples,</hi> with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
have I desired to eat this Passover with you before I
suffer: <hi>and in prosecution of it, that</hi> he took the Cup,
and gave thanks, and said, Divide it among your selves, for
I will not Drink of the Fruit of the Vine, <hi>&amp;c. he irreve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently
represents it as if it was no more than if he drunk
only to satisfie Nature.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Case examined.</note> 
               <hi>For so he saith;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pag. 14.</note> Before Christ
did eat the paschal Supper, he drank a Cup of Wine, and
doubtless at it he drank also, though it be not recorded.
People need no Institution to drink while they are eating.</p>
            <p>As if the Evangelist had no more to do than to tell
us Christ drank a Cup of Wine with his Meat. Surely
there is a better account to be given of this matter; The
Text it self shews it. And the Jewish Authors and others
that write of their customs, do sufficiently inform us. In
which he must be very ignorant or incredulous, that will
say (as he doth) that no more is signified by it than that
<hi>every one might drink as his appetite required;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Case examined.</note> and no less
irreverent that can think that what is recorded of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's
taking the Cup, and blessing,<note place="margin">Pag. 32.</note> and drinking in the
Passover, was only to serve that end.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The next thing I insisted upon was our Saviour's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance
with them in the posture us'd by them at the Pass<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pag. 3.</note> 
               <hi>contrary (as he owns) to what was used at the first
Institution. Of this, he saith,</hi> Our Saviour used the Jewish po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:52407:21"/>
in eating the passover,<note n="a" place="margin">Pag. 84</note> being a posture no where, that
we know of, used by Idolaters, nor being any posture of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doration,
but their ordinary posture of eating Meat. 2. <hi>He
saith, that</hi> every one might use the posture which was
most convenient for the Nature of the Action: <hi>and that
he doth</hi> not see any reason to conclude they would have
shut out any that because of the institution desired to eat
it with his loyns girt, <hi>&amp;c. 3. That,</hi> if they did use any
uniform posture, yet it was because they agreed it among
themselves. <hi>In all which there is hardly any thing said
but is full of mistake. As,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. He saith, the <hi>posture used by our Saviour was no
where, that he knows of, used by Idolaters, nor was a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture
of Adoration.</hi> I cannot tell how far our Author's
Learning may extend in this matter, but that the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture
of discumbing was used at festival Solemnities
<hi>from ancient times, by the Grecians, Medes, Persians, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians,
Romans, and Jews,</hi> &amp;c. and from thence transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to their Sacrifical Feasts, which the Heathens did
very anciently observe<note n="a" place="margin">Herodotus, l. 1. c. 31.</note>, is sufficiently known<note n="b" place="margin">Casab exercit. 16. c. 22</note>
insomuch that the whole Solemnity was call'd amongst
the Romans <hi>Lectisternium</hi>
               <note n="c" place="margin">Rosini antiq. l. 4. c. 15.</note>. This is Confirm'd by Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture.
So <hi>Amos. 2. 8. They lay themselves down upon
Clothes laid to pledge by every Altar,</hi> &amp;c. That is, <hi>the
Beds which they used in the Temples of their Gods,</hi> saith <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saubon,</hi>

            <p>And whereas he saith this was <hi>no posture of Adoration,</hi>
he must needs be mistaken, if he grants what they did
in those Solemnities in Honour to their Gods to be A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doration.
And this they did, for it was an entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

well acquainted with.</p>
            <p>As for what he further saith, <hi>If the Jews did use one
uniform posture,</hi> &amp;c. there needs not many words to
shew how precarious or false it is. For what more preca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
than to speak doubtfully <hi>(If they did)</hi> of that
which yet is clearly evident they did observe? Or af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm,
that <hi>if they did, it was because they agreed it among
themselves,</hi> which is to suppose the reason of the thing
to be certain, when the thing it self according to him
is uncertain? Or what more false since whether
it was by agreement among themselves, or by the
Authority of the Church, that there was this Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity
of posture is not so certain, as it is that there was
this Uniformity, and that they were universally obliged
to use and observe it? For it was required that discum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biture
should be used in all Religious Feasts, but especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
at the Passover by all without exception in the first
part of the Solemnity.<note place="margin">Lightfoot.</note> For which I refer our Author
to one well-versed in these matters.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>So little Truth, or certainty is there in what our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
asserts, that</hi> every one might use the posture which was
most convenient; <hi>and that</hi> there was no reason to conclude
they would have shut out any from their paschal Societies
that desired to eat it with his loyns girt, <hi>&amp;c. or standing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The next instance produced in the abovesaid <hi>Case of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different
things,</hi> and objected against by our Author, is the
<hi>Hours of Prayer,</hi> which were observ'd amongst the Jews,
at Morning, Noon, and Evening. Act. 2 15. c. 10. 9. c. 3. 1.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="40" facs="tcp:52407:22"/>
               <hi>Of these our Author gives this account:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Case Examin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, p. 15.</note> Thus the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
used the hours of Prayer, which also they might have
changed, if they had pleased. That the Jews sent any to
Goals, or excommunicated any for not keeping to those hours
we do not find. There is nothing of Religion in the time,
more then in any other part of time. Thus St. <hi>Paul</hi> used
Circumcision and Purification.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thus:</hi> How is that? Did the Apostles use the hours
of Prayer onely <hi>as necessary circumstances of Humane acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
or such without which the light of Nature, or Common
usage shews the thing cannot be done,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pag. 1.</note> 
               <hi>or conveniently or
comelily done,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pag. 14.</note> as he saith? Or rather did they not use them
as they found them instituted and observed in the Jewish
Church? And not for his <hi>Thus,</hi> and the reasons given by
him? Will those reasons justifie those very hours of the
day, or the just number of three hours? Or however,
how will they Justify the Prayers used at those hours;
But whatever exceptions he had against the time, he it
seems found nothing to say to the Service,<note place="margin">Case of Indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent things. P. 11.</note> which yet
was pleaded as well as that.</p>
            <p>But he saith, <hi>There is nothing of Religion in the time.</hi>
If so (as is granted) then it's in the power of a Church
to institute and determine it, where there is no other
Religion in the Time, than as it's thus separated to the
Service of God.</p>
            <p>Lastly he saith, <hi>The Apostles might have changed the
Hours of Prayer, if they had pleased.</hi> How might they
have changed them? Might they do it as Apostolical
Persons, or as Private Members of the Jewish Church?
As to the former I find not they did exercise any such
Power within the Jurisdiction of the Jewish Church,
nor that they had any Commission so to do. As for
the latter, I deny it. For if it lay in the power of Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Members of a Church to alter the Hours in which
the Church is to assemble, it is in their power to Dissolve
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:52407:22"/>
the Assembly, and there could nothing but Confusion
issue from it. I must confess he seems to be at a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
loss what to say as to this matter. And it appears
so when he dares not so much as touch upon the Prayers
used. In those hours, and applies his <hi>Thus</hi> to St. <hi>Paul's</hi>
using <hi>Circumcision and Purification,</hi> as if they also were
<hi>necessary circumstances of Humane action; or such with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
which the light of Nature or Common Vsage shews
the thing cannot be done,</hi> &amp;c. which were things of pure
Institution at the first, and what though peculiar to the
Jewish Church, the Apostle complied with them in for
a time.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The next instances produced in proof of the Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
were,</hi> Washing the Disciples feet, Love-Feasts, and
Holy-Kiss which he joyns together, and of which he saith,</p>
            <p>1. It's impossible to prove,<note place="margin">Pag. 12, 15, 16, 19.</note> that they were any more
than Civil usages, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. They were not used in Worship.</p>
            <p>Whether it is <hi>impossible to prove</hi> the first or no, doth
not rest upon our Author's authority,<note place="margin">Case of Indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renc things. P. 13.</note> and yet that is the
only thing which he hath thought fit to confront what
I produced in proof of it. That they were Civil rites is
granted, but that they were used by Christ and the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
as <hi>no more than Civil,</hi> is (I may safely venture to say)
<hi>impossible to prove.</hi> First, Because there is the reason
of the thing against it, as they were instituted and
used for Spiritual ends, and in token of Christian Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility
and Charity (as I then shewed).<note place="margin">Case of Indiff. p. 9. 12.</note> Secondly,
Because of the great Difference there was betwixt them
when used as meerly Civil, and as used by our Saviour
and the Apostles. What this was as to washing the
feet,<note place="margin">Hor. in Joh. c. 13. 5.</note> I then shewed where he might be Satisfied and to
<hi>Buxtorf</hi> I may add the Learned Dr. <hi>Lightfoot.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It appears further they were not meerly Civil from
the Character given to the kiss of Charity, being
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:52407:23"/>
called the Holy Kiss. But This was (saith he) <hi>because
the Apostle commanded Christians to use it in a Sober,
Temperate, Chast, Or holy manner.</hi> But if this was the
reason, then all Kisses, and all Feasts would be holy:
But now Holiness stamps somewhat peculiar upon
the thing it's applied to and signifies that by Some
act, end, or use, it's Separated from the rest of the
same kind. And for this reason was it more likely
the kiss was called Holy, from its end, use and signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
(as it was a Testimony of that Holy and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
love, which was or ought to have been amongst
Christians) rather than in respect of the manner; for
what reason was there for that, when it was betwixt
persons of the same, and not a different, Sex. Besides, if
it was a meer Civil rite, and design'd for no Religious
end, could we think the Apostle would require it, and
close his Epistles so frequently with it? Lastly, it appears
they were not used as mere Civil Rites, because they
were used in Religious Assemblies, and some of them
annexed thereunto.<note place="margin">Pag. 16.</note> Of this (he saith) <hi>he can never
prove, that while Our Saviour was Worshipping his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he stept aside to wash his Disciples Feet: Or that
the Primitive Christians were either Kissing or Feasting
one another in the Time or Act of Worship, as Praying,</hi> &amp;c.
It would have become our Author rather to have remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
the proofs given of this, than to call for more:
which if he had considered he would have expressed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
with more caution and reverence. That washing
the Disciples feet had a Spiritual signification, I have
shewed, and so was not unfit for a Religious Solemnity;
and that it was used in such, the Apostle shews, <hi>Joh. 13. 4.</hi>
for a further account of which I leave him to the Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>Casaubon;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Exercit. 16. n. 22. &amp; 24.</note> How and when the Holy Kiss was used, and
how it was called the Seal of Prayer and reconciliation,
I then shewed,<note place="margin">Libertas, l 2. c. 1. <hi>§. 3.</hi>
               </note> and is so fully proved by Dr. <hi>Falkner,</hi> that
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:52407:23"/>
there needs no more to be added, till that, at least, be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed.
That the Love-Feasts were joyned to, and used
at the same time as the Lord's Supper, not only the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle's
discourse upon it sheweth; but also the change
of Names, and the giving of one to the other doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
it.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 11. 20.</note> For <hi>Theophylact</hi> supposeth that the Apostle
calls the Love-Feast by the name of the Lord's Supper:
And on the contrary <hi>Tertullian</hi> declares that from hence
the Lord's Supper came to be called <gap reason="foreign">

               </note>
            </p>
            <p>After I had proved that <hi>things Indifferent, though not
prescribed, might be used in Divine Worship</hi> from the
practice of the Jewish Church and that of Christ and the
Apostles: I further confirm'd it from the incapacity we
should be in of holding Communion with any Church
(if it were otherwise) whether Ancient or Modern.</p>
            <p>But our Author doth endeavour at once to overthrow
it.<note place="margin">Case examined Pag. 21.</note> For saith he, <hi>that every particular Christian must
practise every thing which the Churches practise which he
hath Communion with, or be concluded to have no Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
with it, is to us a New Assertion.</hi> And so it is to
me,<note place="margin">Case of Indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent things. Pag. 15.</note> who only did maintain these two things, That there
was no Church or Society but would be found guilty if
things uncommanded were unlawful; and if the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
such uncommanded things would make Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
with a Church unlawful, then no Church could be
Communicated with. So that all that I affirmed was,
there could be no Communion Lawful to such as held
it unlawful to commun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>cate with a Church for the Sake
of things uncommanded. And who are concerned in
this our Author very well knows; such I mean, as plead
this as an argument for their present Separation. But
though the Assertion, as he words it, is neither mine, nor
true; yet I dare affirm there are some things uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:52407:24"/>
which every particular Christian must practise,
or else he can be said to have no Communion with the
Churches where such things are practised; Such are
Forms of Prayer, and receiving the Sacrament in the
Forenoon, and without sitting, where there is no provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
made for them that would use that posture, as well
as where it is not allowed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And this was the case in the ancient Churches. To
which he replies,</hi> Their practices are great uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainties,
and their writings depraved, <hi>or,</hi> it cannot
be made appear, that none could have any Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
with those Churches, unless he did eat the Lord's
Supper fasting, or prayed toward the East. <hi>That their
writings are depraved is very true, But that they are so
depraved as that there is nothing certainly theirs, is what
no one will assert. And that they are not depraved in
the passages or things I quoted from thence, is very evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
from the concurrence of the Fathers therein, and
the general consent of learned men of all sides. As to
what he saith that</hi> it doth not appear that none could
have Communion with them, unless, <hi>&amp;c. It were easy to
refute it, and to shew it in the Instances I gave; and to
make it out in one for all,</hi> viz. <hi>That of</hi> receiving the
Lord's Supper Fasting; <hi>of which St.</hi> Austin <hi>saith thus,</hi>
Liquidò apparet,<note place="margin">Epist. 118. ad Januar.</note> 
               <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It plainly appears that our Saviour and
his Disciples did not receive it Fasting, but shall the Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal
Church be therefore reproached, because it receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
Fasting? And this pleased the Holy-Ghost, that in Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of so great a Sacrament, the Body of Christ should
First enter into the mouth of a Christian. For therefore
is this custom observed through the universal Church. <hi>And
more to the same purpose may our Author read in that
Epistle.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now when this was the practice (as they say) of the
Universal Church, and that they so practised upon the
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:52407:24"/>
score of an Apostolical Precept, as St. <hi>Austin</hi> there saith,
(how truly is not my business to enquire) can we think
that it was not required? Or that there could be any
Communion with those Churches, if any did otherwise?
I added to the ancient Church, the State of the Reformed
Churches abroad, and shewed how they do use <hi>things
uncommanded</hi> in the Worship of God, and how impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
it is upon the principles of those that dissent from
our Church to hold Communion with theirs. To this
he replies, <hi>we have not heard of any thing used among them
in Worship,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>but what is prescribed, excepting
only some Forms of Prayer relating to the Sacrament.
2. None of these receive the Sacrament kneeling.
3. They compel not any to receive Standing or Sitting.</hi>
I would be loth to charge our Author with want of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence
or integrity, but how reconcilable this is to it
that he saith, I must leave to the impartial Reader. Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
however the first to be true, yet if they have some
Forms they have somewhat <hi>not prescribed.</hi> But have
they <hi>only some Forms relating to the Sacrament?</hi>
What then shall we say to <hi>Capellus,</hi>

mean that there were none but <hi>Lutherans</hi> in that Synod,
or that the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> in that Synod, only determined it?
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:52407:25"/>
Which way soever he would be understood it's a wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
mistake. For the Synod was composed of those of the
<hi>Helvetick, Augustan,</hi> and <hi>Bohemick</hi> Confession, and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
by all of them, and was indeed but one of several
Synods they held in Common together. If he had but
looked into this Synod, all this discourse might have been
saved, and he might have answered his own Question,
<hi>We desire to know what more receive Sitting except the
Lutheran Churches?</hi> What he produceth the 3d. for, I
cannot well understand, for it's all one if those Churches
forbid any one particular posture as if they required ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
<note place="margin">V. Case of Kneeling. p. 14. 15.</note> And yet some do forbid Sitting, as the Synod a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
quoted, and one Church Kneeling.</p>
            <p>I proceeded further to shew that they themselves could
not then be Communicated with, since they do things
without prescription; as in administring the Sacraments,
conceived Prayer, Swearing, and Church-Governments
and order. He saith, <hi>we do not make Sitting necessary;</hi> but
that is not the point in dispute, for he by his principles
should shew where it is commanded. For conceived
Prayer he argues, <hi>How this is prescribed, he and others
have been told elsewhere,</hi> and those that have told it, have
had a sufficient answer.</p>
            <p>Laying the hands on the Book, he saith, <hi>is a civil, no
sacred usage;</hi> as if the invoking God, and a solomn te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony
of our so invoking him by some external Rite,
were meerly civil. Such then was lifting up the hand,
which was anciently used in swearing, and so appropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated
to it, that it was put for swearing it self, <hi>Gen. 14.
22. Ex. 6. 8.</hi> They that can affirm such things as
these, may affirm any thing.</p>
            <p>As for the things relating to Church-order, he saith,
<hi>Ten times more is allowed to matters of Government than
Worship.</hi> But he undertakes not my argument taken
from the parity of reason betwixt the Kingly and
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:52407:25"/>
Priestly offices of our Saviour:<note place="margin">Vindicat. of Presbyt. Gov. p. 4.</note> And which the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian
Brethren so approve of as to use the same Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
for Government as Worship.</p>
            <p>The Third general was to enquire,<note place="margin">§. 3.</note> how we might
know what things are indifferent in the Worship of
God. The main things he herein objects against, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
Edification; In handling of which, he thus sums
up my sense of it; <hi>Our Author would not have us judge
of Edification from what most improveth Christians in
knowledg and grace,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Case examined. Pag. 33.</note> 
               <hi>but from what tendeth most to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Order;</hi> as if I spoke of Order, in opposition to, and
as exclusive of a Christians improvement, whereas I
plainly say, and he acknowledgeth it, that <hi>we are not
so much to judge of them asunder, as together.</hi> The
meaning and design of what I said, was to shew that
Christians are to consider themselves as members of a
Church, and so to have a tender regard to Communion
with it, and not to think their own Edification a suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
reason, to break the Peace and Order of it.</p>
            <p>To this he saith several things. In Answer to which it
will be convenient to give a clear representation and
state of the Case, which I shall do in these Propositions.</p>
            <p>1. We must consider that Edification is not the laying a
Foundation, but a building upon it, and so there is not
the same reason for the breaking Order for the sake of
Edification, as there is for the sake of things absolutly ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to Salvation, and that which will warrant and
doth oblige to the one, will not warrant nor oblige to
the other. This will serve to shew the little force there
is in what this Reverend Author confidently asserts,<note place="margin">Pag. 34<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> 
               <hi>We
know and are assured, that no man, to keep up any such hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
bounds</hi> (of Order,) <hi>ought to omit means by which he
may improve his own Soul in the knowledge of Christ,
or the exercise of his habits of Grace;</hi> by which asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his he makes Edification and improvement in
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:52407:26"/>
knowledge, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as necessary as the knowledge of
the Fundamentals of Religion.</p>
            <p>2. We must consider (as I then observed that Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
is a means of Edification,<note place="margin">Case of Indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent things. P. 36.</note> and therefore if there hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens
a dispute betwixt observing Order, and improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in knowledg or grace, it's 'twixt means and means,
'twixt what is for Edification in one way, and what
is for it in another, and not betwixt what is for, and what
is against Edification,<note place="margin">Case examined. Pag. 35</note> as he would have it understood.</p>
            <p>3. We must observe that when there is a dispute be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
means and means, the less is to give place to the
greater, and what is most for Edification, is to yield
to that which is least.</p>
            <p>4. That for that reason the Edification of the Church,
and the welfare of the whole is to be prefer'd before
the spiritual advantage of any particular member; for
what the less is to the greater, that is a member to the
Church; and if a person cannot serve and improve him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
without damage to the Publick, he is rather to sit
down without that improvement, than to do mischief
to the Community for the obtaining it; And as long as
he is not without means sufficient for Salvation, he is
in that Case to recede from some further attainments; in
doing which, for so good an end, <hi>he is acceptable to God,
and approved of men.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 14. 18.</note> So that however our Author may
seem to shelter himself under the phrase of <hi>Human Order,</hi>
yet as long as no Church can subsist without it,<note place="margin">Case Examined p. 34. 35.</note> and he
that takes away Order takes away the Church, and he
that saith a person <hi>ought to throw it down to improve his
Soul,</hi> takes away Order; he must pardon me if I think
that he talks without consideration, for he that talks of
Edification of particular Souls, in a distinct notion
from the building them up as members of a Church,
or of members of a Church without being united as a
Church, or of a Church without any means to unite it,

as also what was said before in the controverted Tract,
and he hath not yet answered, or has been since dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coursed
of in another Case.</p>
            <p>The <hi>4th.</hi> enquiry in the Tract aforesaid was,<note place="margin">§. 4.</note> How
we are to determine our selves in the use of Indifferent
Things in the Worship of God? Under which head I
shewed what respect is to be given to Authority, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Ecclestiastical or Civil.</p>
            <p>In Answer to which our Author takes up the Case of
Imposition,<note place="margin">Case Examined, p. 39.</note> and propounds Two Questions, which in
effect are these.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q. 1.</hi> Whether there be any Authority in Church or
State, to determine the things which God hath left Indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
to his people?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q. 2.</hi> Whether in Case they make any such Law, the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
may, without sin, obey them?</p>
            <p>As for the First,<note place="margin">Pag. 5. 9. 17<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 32. 40.</note> he saith there and elsewhere, <hi>We
cannot conceive how it is possible that in things of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Worship, things of an Indifferent nature should be
the matter of any human determination;</hi> and again, that
<hi>in matters of Worship, no Superiours may restrain, what
God hath left at liberty.</hi> We are not immediately con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
in this First Question, for our business was to
consider not so much the extent of our Superiours pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
in what Cases they may lawfully command, as in
what we may lawfully obey. But yet because he hath
herein offered somewhat like an Argument, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the clearing of this will make way for the Second,
I shall take it into consideration. To render his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:52407:27"/>
the more compleat, I shall repair to a foregoing
part of his Book, and make use of that in conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
with what he saith here, and he thus represents it.</p>
            <p>We cannot be fully of our Brothers mind,<note place="margin">Pag. 9.</note> that in the
Worship of God Superiours may determine circumstances
which God hath left at liberty. God left it at liberty
to the Jews, to take a Lamb or a Kid, Turtle-Doves or
Young-Pigeons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> We offer it to the judgment of the
whole reasonable World, whether <hi>Moses</hi> after this might
have made a Law commanding the Jews to use none but
Kids, and only Turtle-Doves, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> [for it had been a
controulment of the Divine Wisdom.] If not, let not our
B. think it strange if we judge the same of words in Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
which God hath left at liberty, <hi>&amp;c. This is an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
I find offered long since by Dr.</hi> Ames,<note n="a" place="margin">Fresh suit. part 2. p. 300.</note> 
               <hi>and
which is so considerable in our Authors opinion, that
he often repeats it elsewhere</hi>
               <note n="b" place="margin">Pag. 17. 30. 32. 39. 41.</note>.</p>
            <p>In Answer to this,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>1st.</hi> I shall consider the Case under the Law, and
how far what he hath said will hold good.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>2ly.</hi> I shall shew that there is not that parity betwixt
the Case Then, and the Case Now, as to render that
unlawful Now, which would have been unlawful Then.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>1st.</hi> I shall consider the Case Then, and I doubt not
to affirm, <hi>it would have been no controulment of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Wisdom,</hi> for <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> to have injoyn'd the
Jews in some circumstances, to have taken a Kid or a
Turtle only; As when it was for a publick convenience
and necessity: There was somewhat of this kind of
Equity in the first establishment of it; So the poor
was to bring such of <hi>these as he could get:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Lev. 14. 30.</note> And Mr.
<hi>Pool</hi> saith,<note place="margin">On Lev. 1. 14.</note> 
               <hi>These Birds were appointed for the relief of
the poor, who could bring no better.</hi> And certainly he
that grants it was to be <hi>left to the discretion and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience
of the offerer which to determine,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pag. 30.</note> (as our Author
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:52407:27"/>
doth) should not deny the like power to Superiours for
a publick convenience and benefit; nor can this be to
<hi>blot out</hi> (as his phrase is) <hi>what God has written,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pag. 17.</note> as
long as they do it not in opposition to his Authority.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>2ly.</hi> Supposing, that <hi>where God had wrote Or's</hi> (as
he saith) and that to command the use of one of them
alone, had in that Case been <hi>a controulment of his wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi>
yet the Case Then is not parallel to ours. For,
(1.) The Case was then determined, it was indeed a Lamb
or a Kid, but so as no other Beast, a Turtle or a Pige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
but so as no other bird was to be used instead of them.</p>
            <p>But now though there is the <hi>Or</hi> under the Gospel,
yet it is without such restraint, for ours is free through
the whole kind, and nothing determines us, but a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonancy
to the general rules. It's so an <hi>Or</hi> and an <hi>Aliàs,</hi>
that nothing of the kind is excepted. So saith our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
himself;<note place="margin">Pag. 30.</note> 
               <hi>In Prayer God hath left standing, sitting or
kneeling, to our choice and conveniency,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>He hath left
us at liberty what words to use, what method or order to
observe,</hi> &amp;c. (2.) As the disjunction was then deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined,
so the very disjunction it self was of Divine
institution, and the liberty they had to choose one of
the two, as well as the restraint of not choosing any but
one of the two, was from the special Law of God.
And then for Authority to have determined what God
had left free, had some shew of <hi>controulment of the Divine
Wisdom;</hi> especially if it had been required (as our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
somewhere supposeth) that they should <hi>never have
offer'd</hi> any other but one sort of them.<note place="margin">Pag. 9.</note> But under the
Gospel it is otherwise, for the disjunction, the <hi>Or</hi> and
the <hi>Aliàs,</hi> doth not proceed from Divine Institution,
but from the nature of things, and sometimes from hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Art and Contrivance. As when Washing is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded,
(for I shall not contend about it) all the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars
are comprehended, and the person might be
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:52407:28"/>
dipped or sprinkled, or have water poured on him, as
he observes;<note place="margin">Pag. 22.</note> so in receiving the Sacrament, the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture
of the Primitive Church (not of meer standing,
as he mistakes me,<note place="margin">Pag. 35.</note> but) of standing (as I said) by way
of incurvation; or sitting, or kneeling, are all compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended
under the general species of posture. Again
sometimes this <hi>Or</hi> and <hi>Aliàs</hi> proceeds from human Art
and Contrivance, hence the diversity of habits, as a
Gown, Cloak, Surplice. Now when this disjunction
doth proceed not from Divine Institution, but from the
reasons aforesaid, and that there is no special Command
of God to interpose, determine, restrain, or disjoyn, it
can be no <hi>controulment</hi> of the Wisdom or Authority of
God for a Church to interpose, restrain, or determine
these matters in his Worship. This is plain in the Case
of Meats and Drinks, in which under the Law there
was a restraint, an <hi>Or</hi> and <hi>Aliàs,</hi> This and not That,
and there is still an <hi>Or</hi> arising from the nature of these
things, and yet a determination or restraint herein is no
<hi>controulment of the divine Wisdom,</hi> as it might have been
under the Law, because there is no Institution that doth
interpose: And the Case must be the same in Divine
Worship, in which since there is no Institution about
these matters, it's no sin to Act in the same way;
that is, it's no sin for Authority to limit and determin,
and for others to be limited, and determined; which
brings me to the next Question.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q. 2. Whether in Case such things are determined, peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
may, without sin, obey?</hi> Upon this our Author speaks
very variously, sometimes determining for Authority a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Principle,<note n="a" place="margin">P. 7. 38.</note> sometimes for the Principle a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
Authority<note n="b" place="margin">P. 9. 30.</note>. And at last leaves it <hi>problemati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal,</hi>
and saith they are <hi>divided</hi> upon it amongst them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
<note n="c" place="margin">P. 39, 40.</note>. I think not my self at present concern'd
to shew the absurdity of this Principle, as, how (if
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:52407:28"/>
this be true) the same things must be lawful and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful
according as they are required or forbidden by
our Superiours, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But shall only consider what he
offers on its behalf.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>He saith they may not in this Case obey, without
sin,</hi> because nature teacheth us not to part with all our
natural liberty.</p>
            <p>2. Because we have a command to stand fast in the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As to the former, I only say (and that's enough)
that Nature teacheth us and doth oblige us to part with
some of our liberty in Communities: And they are far
from being required to <hi>part with all</hi> in ours, and so if
his argument have any thing in it, it hath nothing in
it as to our Case.</p>
            <p>For the Second,<note place="margin">Case of Indiff. Things, p. 46.</note> I leave him to what was said by way
of prevention, in the Tract he opposeth, and which
he should have Answered before he had made use of this
as an Argument.</p>
            <p>All that he hath excepted against upon that subject
is the notion I laid down of Christian Liberty, which I
said was no other than the Liberty which mankind had,
before it was restrained by particular Institution, and
he gives this reason against it,<note place="margin">Case Exam. p. 40.</note> 
               <hi>For in that [viz.</hi> Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Liberty] <hi>we must not stand fast, because Divine Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution
hath restrained us in it,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>neither hath Christ
restored us to any such Liberty.</hi> In Answer to this I
shall consider what Natural Liberty is, and then what
Liberty it is that the Apostle did treat of? As to the
Former, it's no other but the free use or disuse of things
Indifferent, whether out of, or in the Worship of God.
As to the Latter, it was no other than a freedom from
the Jewish <hi>yoke of bondage,</hi> and that Law that <hi>gendred</hi>
to it, as the whole current of the Apostles discourse doth
shew. And therefore it could be with respect to no
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:52407:29"/>
other condition than that which mankind would have
been, had there been no such particular Institution, and
was in before that Institution. 'Twas the nature of the
Law, and the injoining of it by divine Institution, so as
it became necessary to them,<note place="margin">Act. 15. 18.</note> that made it a <hi>Yoke,</hi> and a
Yoke intolerable, and it was a freedom from that Law
that constitutes the Liberty which the Apostle treats of
in that Epistle: And if it be also to be taken as our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
would have it) <hi>for a freedom, in matters of Worship,
from any thing but what is of Divine Institution,</hi> that
is a secondary sense, and which may be taken from
some parity of reason betwixt Case and Case, but is not
the Apostles, nor the primary sense of it. But take it
how we will in this or the other,<note place="margin">Case of Indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent things. Pag. 47.</note> I there shewed that
the Apostles exhortation was of no use to them that
plead it against submission to Authority in Indifferent
Things, when imposed in or about Divine Worship.</p>
            <p>I am now come to the last general head of the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said
Tract,<note place="margin">§. 5.</note> which contained a short account of the
things required in our Church, as they were either Duty
or Indifferent. And for an inforcement of that, and
conclusion of the whole, I shall briefly shew how far
this Reverend Author consents to, or by his concessions
must be bound to acknowledge it. Indeed he some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
doth tell us,<note place="margin">Case Examin. pag. 3. 36. 38.</note> that <hi>Nine parts of Ten of all Dissenters
say they cannot comply with things required in the</hi> English
<hi>Liturgy, because they believe the things sinful and unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful;</hi>
And elsewhere, <hi>Two hardly of an Hundred</hi> think
them Indifferent: But whether our Author be of that
number, or at least has reason so to be, I shall leave to
his own conscience, as to himself, and to his concessions
as to others. In which I shall observe the method taken
in the aforesaid Tract, where I said all things objected
against, might be refer'd to Posture, Forms, and Times,
and shew'd these to be Natural or Moral circumstances
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:52407:29"/>
of Action, and inseparable from it. Now in general he
grants what are such <hi>may be lawfully used;</hi>
               <note place="margin">pag. 14.</note> And if we
come to particulars, he doth at last yield it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>As for postures what more scrupled and opposed than
Kneeling at the Sacrament?</hi>
               <note place="margin">pag. 22.</note> 
               <hi>Yet of this he saith</hi> There
is no command in it,<note place="margin">pag. 12.</note> and it is Indifferent; <hi>that</hi> in all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability
our Saviour administred it Kneeling, and sitting
backward upon his Legs;<note place="margin">pag. 36.</note> 
               <hi>that</hi> no Dissenter refuseth it,
because it is not decent, but because it is a posture of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doration;
<hi>that</hi> our Church doth not intend it as an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
to the Body of Christ there really present, <hi>but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares
that</hi> to do it as to the bread,<note place="margin">pag. 12, 13.</note> were an Idolatry to
be abhor'd; <hi>And in conclusion tells us, that</hi> those that
hesitate in that point, fear a posture of Adoration used
by Idolatrous Papists; <hi>which is a consideration of no
moment as has been already shewed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>As to Forms of Prayer, (he saith)</hi> God has left us
at liberty what words to use;<note place="margin">pag. 30.</note> 
               <hi>and further, that</hi> for conceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Prayer,<note place="margin">pag. 22.</note> we know no body saith no other must be used
in Gods Worship; <hi>and if so, then Forms may be lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
used in it:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Case of Indiff. p. 8.</note> 
               <hi>But suppose any scruple the use of them,
he saith however,</hi> We know no reason but people may
hear them,<note place="margin">Case Exam. p. 22.</note> if any scruples the use of them he may yet
have Communion with the Church, we hope, though he
doth not act in it as a Minister.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>As to time,</hi>
               <note place="margin">pag. 29.</note> 
               <hi>he saith,</hi> the Law of Nature directs;
<hi>and for Festivals, such as</hi> Purim <hi>amongst the Jews, he
saith,</hi>
               <note place="margin">pag. 26.</note> It was generally commanded under the precepts of
giving thanks for publick mercies.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lastly,</hi> Are the things required unlawful because

<hi>are not of that mind;</hi>
               <note place="margin">pag. 39.</note> nay he affirms that <hi>the most
sober Dissenters will agree in these things,</hi>
               <note place="margin">pag. 7.</note> [that is, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
circumstances] <hi>to obey the command of Superiours,
provided it be not such as by circumstances is made sinful.</hi>
               <pb n="56" facs="tcp:52407:30"/>
But if imposition would make them sinful, such a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
must not have been obeyed. So that in the
conclusion, I see no reason why our Reverend Brother<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and the Dissenters he defends, and that <hi>in all things</hi>
(as he saith <hi>agree to the Doctrine professed in the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
of the Church of</hi> England,<note place="margin">pag. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

Liturgy and Ceremonies of it,</hi> as far as Lay-Communion
is concerned in them. Nor why he should tell us so
much of <hi>Goals,</hi>
               <note place="margin">pag. 41, 44.</note> 
               <hi>and Sessions, and Judicatures,</hi> and of the
Sufferings they endure, when if there things be true)
it's for not doing what they lawfully can. It is no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
when such with-hold communion from the Church,
and set up other Churches against it, that some call
them (as he complains) <hi>perverse and contamacious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,</hi>
               <note place="margin">ibid.</note> and others call them <hi>damnable Schismaticks</hi> and
are so bold as to say that such <hi>a separation from that
Church,</hi>
               <note place="margin">pag. 1.</note> 
               <hi>is a separation from Christ;</hi> And it's likely he
will meet with such that will speak very severe things
of his following appeal to God, <hi>Judge O thou righteous
Judge between these people,</hi>
               <note place="margin">pag. 41, 44.</note> 
               <hi>and those who thus pursue
them.</hi> I am far from one (God is my witness that is
<hi>a smiter of his fellow-servants</hi> as he calls them) nor
would have any one do <hi>what he verily believeth is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful;</hi>
               <note place="margin">pag. 41.</note> but I do think it is the duty of all to do what
they lawfully can, to hear readily, and consider impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially
what may be offered for their satisfaction, and to
suffer patiently where they cannot receive it. This I
think every truly <hi>conscientious person will</hi> do, and I
should question his conscience that doth it not. <hi>Certainly</hi>
(to return him his own words) if our Brethren <hi>have
any value for the Glory of God,</hi>
               <note place="margin">ibid.</note> 
               <hi>for the good and
peace of others Souls, for the preserving the Protestant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
for the union of Protestants against Popish ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries,
for any thing indeed that is good and lovely,</hi>
they will rather break than any longer <hi>draw this saw
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:52407:30"/>
of contention,</hi> and will do as much as in them lies for
the repairing of those breaches which must be confessed
are no less dangerous than scandalous to our Religion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Kingdom of God is not Meat and Drink, but righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
