            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

and bleſſings whereby hee hath not onely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
us from many wicked Plots, and deſignes,
which if they had taken effect would have brought
ruine, and deſtruction upon this Kingdome; but out
of thoſe attempts hath produced divers evident, and remarkable advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages
to the furtherance of thoſe ſervices, which we have beene deſirous
to performe to our Soveraigne Lord the King, and to this Church and

of the malignant party diſappointed of that prey, the Religion and
liberty of this Kingdome, which they were ready to ſeiſe upon, and
devour before the beginning of this Parliament, have ſtill perſiſted by
new practiſes, both of force and ſubtility, to recover the ſame againe:
for which purpoſe they have made ſeverall attempts for the bringing up
of the Army; they afterwards projected the falſe accuſation of the Lord

Majeſty as to procure him to take it upon himſelfe, but when the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable

upon the Parliament, to be publiſhed in his name, whereby
they might make it odious to the people, and by their helpe to deſtroy
that, which hitherto hath been the onely meanes of their owne preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
            <p>For this purpoſe they have drawn his Majeſty into the Northerne

and his Subjects, which the more ſpeedily to effect, they have
cauſed a Preſſe to be tranſported to <hi>Yorke,</hi> from whence ſeverall papers,
and writings of that kinde are conveyed to all parts of the Kingdome,
without the authority of the great ſeale, in an unuſuall and illegall
manner, and without the advice of his Majeſties Privy Counſell; from
the greater, and better part whereof having withdrawne himſelfe, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well
as from his great Councell of parliament, he is thereby expoſed to
the wicked and unfaithfull councells of ſuch as have made the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
and juſtice of the Parliament dangerous to themſelves, and this
danger they labour to prevent by hiding their owne guilt, under the
name and ſhadow of the King: infuſing into him their owne feares, and
aſmuch as in them lies, aſperſing his royall perſon and honour with
their owne infamy, from both which it hath alwayes been as much the
care as it is the duty of the Parliament, to preſerve his Majeſty, and to
fix the guilt of all evill act<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ons and counſells, upon thoſe who have
been the authors of them.</p>
            <p>Amongſt divers writings of this kinde, wee the Lords and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
in Parliament, have taken into our conſideration two printed pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers;
the firſt containing a declaration which they received from his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtie
in anſwer of that which was preſented to his Majeſty from both
Houſes of Parliament at <hi>Newmarket</hi> the ninth of March. 1641. The
other his Majeſties anſwer to the petition of both Houſes preſented to
his Majeſty at <hi>Yorke</hi> the 26 of <hi>March.</hi> 1642. Both which are filled
with harſh cenſures, and cauſeleſſe charges upon the Parliament concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
which we hold it neceſſary to give ſatisfaction to the Kingdome,
ſeeing we find it very difficult to ſatisfy his Majeſty, who to our great
griefe, we have found to be ſo ingaged to, and poſſeſſed by thoſe miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>apprehenſions
which evill counſellors have wrought in him, that our
moſt humble and faithfull Remonſtrances, have rather irritated and
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:99643:4"/>
imbittered, then any thing allayed or mitigated the ſharpe expreſſions
which his Majeſty hath been pleaſed to make in anſwer unto them, for
the manifeſtation whereof, and of our owne innocency, wee deſire
that all his Majeſties loving Subjects may take notice of theſe par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars.</p>
            <p>We know no occaſion given by us which might move his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty
to tell us that in our declaration preſented at Newmarket, there
were ſome expreſſions different from the uſuall language to Princes.</p>
            <p>Neither did we tell his Maieſty either in words or in effect, that if
he did not joyne with us in an Act which his Maieſty conceived might
prove prejudiciall, and dangerous to himſelfe, and the whole king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
we would make a Law without him, and impoſe it upon the
people. That which we deſired, was, that in regard of the imminent
danger of the Kingdome, the Militia, for the ſecurity of his Majeſty,
and his people, might be put under the command of ſuch noble and
faithfull perſons, as they had all cauſe to confide in, and ſuch was the
neceſſity of this preſervation, that we declared, that if his Majeſty
ſhould refuſe to joyne with us therein, the two Houſes of Parliament
being the ſupreame Court and higheſt councell of the Kingdome, were
enabled by their owne authority to provide for the repulſing of ſuch
imminent, and evident danger, not by any new Law of their owne mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
as hath been untruly ſuggeſted to his Majeſty, but by the moſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
Law of this Kingdom, even that which is fundamentall and eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall
to the conſtitution and ſubſiſtance of it.</p>
            <p>Although we never deſired to encourage his Majeſty to ſuch replies
as might produce any conteſtation betwixt him and his Parliament,

him of how little value his words would be with us, much leſſe
when they are accompanied with actions of Love and Juſtice, His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
hath more reaſon to finde fault with thoſe wicked counſellours,
who have ſo often bereaved him of the honour, and his people of
the fruit, of many gracious Speeches, which hee made to them, ſuch
as thoſe in the end of the laſt parliament; That in the word of a King,
and as he was a Gentleman he would redreſſe the grievances of his
People aſwell out of Parliament as in it, were the ſearching the Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies

and other vexations thereupon, and other enſuing violations

effects of evill counſell, and aboundantly declared in our generall Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrance
of the State of the Kingdome) actions of love and Juſtice,
ſuitable to ſuch words as thoſe.</p>
            <p>As gracious was his Majeſties Speech in the beginning of this Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament;
That he was reſolved to put himſelfe freely, and cleerly upon
the Love and affection of his Engliſh Subjects, whether his cauſeleſſe
complaints and Jealouſie, the unjuſt imputations ſo often caſt upon
his Parliament, his deniall of their neceſſary defence by the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance

great councell, like to produce ſuch a miſchievous diviſion in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
have not beene more ſutable to other mens evill counſells then
to his owne words, will eaſily appeare to any indifferent Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>Neither have his latter ſpeeches beene better uſed, and preſerved by
theſe evill and wicked counſellors: could any words be fuller of Love,
and Juſtice then thoſe in his anſwer to the Meſſage ſent, to the Houſe
of Commons the 31<hi rend="sup">t</hi>h of <hi>December</hi> 1641. We doe engage unto you
ſolemnly the word of a King that the ſecurity of all, and every one
of you from violence, is and ever ſhall be as much our care, as the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation
of Us and our children, and could any actions be fuller of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice
and violence then that of the Attorney generall, in falſely ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſing
the ſix Members of Parliament, and the other proceedings there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon,
within three or fower dayes after that Meſſage, for the full view
whereof let the declaration made of thoſe proceedings be peruſed,
and by thoſe inſtances (we could ad many more) Let the world Judge,
who deſerves to be taxed with diſvalewing his Majeſties Words, they
who have as much as in them lies, ſtaynd and ſullied them with ſuch
fowle counſells, or the Parliament, who have ever manifeſted with joy,
and delight their humble thankfulneſſe for thoſe gracious words, and
actions of love, and Juſtice, which have been conformable thereunto.</p>
            <p>The King is pleaſed to diſavow the having any ſuch evill Counſell or
Counſellors as are mentioned in our Declaration to his knowledge, and
we hold it our duty, humbly to avow there are ſuch, or elſe we muſt ſay,
that all the ill things done of late in his Majeſties name, have beene done
by himſelfe, wherein we ſhould neither follow the direction of the Law
nor the affection of our owne hearts; which is as much as may be to cleere
his Majeſtie from all imputation of misgovernment, and to lay the fault
upon his Miniſters; the falſe accuſing of ſix members of Parliament, the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:99643:6"/>
Juſtifying Mr. Atturney in that falſe accuſation, the violent comming to
the houſe of Commons, the deniall of the Militia, the ſharpe Meſſages to
both houſes, contrary to the Cuſtomes of former Kings, the long and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
abſence of his Majeſtie from Parliament; the heavy and wrongfull
taxes upon both houſes, the Cheriſhing and countenancing a diſconten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
party in the Kingdome againſt them, theſe certainly are the fruits of
very ill Counſell, apt to put the kingdome into a Combuſtion, to hinder
the ſupplies of Ireland, and to countenance the proceedings and preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions
of the Rebells there, and the Authors of theſe evill Counſells,
we conceive muſt needs be knowne to his Majeſty, and we hope our la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
with his Majeſty, to have theſe diſcovered, and brought to a
juſt cenſure, will not ſo much wound his honour in the opinion of
his good Subjects, as his labouring to preſerve and conceale them.</p>
            <p>And whereas his Majeſtie ſaith, he could wiſh that his owne immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
Actions which he avowes on his owne honour, might not bee ſo
roughly cenſured under that Common ſtyle of evill Counſellors: Wee
could alſo heartily wiſh that we had not cauſe to make that ſtile ſo Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
but how often and undutifully ſoever theſe wicked Counſellors
fix their diſhonour upon the King, by making his Majeſty the Authour
of thoſe evill actions, which are the effects of their owne evill Counſells;
We his Majeſties Loyall and dutifull ſubjects can uſe no other ſtile accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to that <hi>Maxime</hi> in the Law, the King can doe no wrong, but if any
ill be committed in matter of ſtate, the Councell; if in matters of Iuſtice,
the Judges muſt anſwer for it.</p>
            <p>We lay no charge upon his Majeſtie, which ſhould put him upon that
apologie, concerning his faithfull and zealous affection of the prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
profeſſion; Neither doth his Majeſtie endeavour to cleere thoſe, in
greateſt authority about him, by whom (wee ſay) that deſigne hath been
potently carried on for divers yeares, and we rather wiſh that the mercies
of heaven then the Judgements may be manifeſted upon them, but
that there have beene ſuch, there are ſo plentifull and frequent evidences,
that we beleeve there is none either proteſtant or Papiſt, who hath had
any reaſonable view of the paſſages of latter times, but either in feare or
hope, did expect a ſuddaine iſſue of this deſigne.</p>
            <p>We have no way tranſgreſſed againſt the Act of Oblivion, by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring
the intended warre againſt Scotland, as a Branch of that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne
to alter religion, by thoſe wicked Councells, from which God did
then deliver us, which we ought never to forget.</p>
            <p>That the Rebellion in Ireland was framed and cheriſht by the Popiſh
and Malignant party in England, is not only affirmed by the Rebells,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:99643:7"/>
but may be cleered by many other proofes; The ſame Rebellious prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
of pretended Religion, the ſame politique ends are apparant in
both, and their malitious deſignes and practices are maskt, and diſguiſed
with the ſame falſe colour of their earneſt zeale to vindicate his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties
prerogative from the ſuppoſed oppreſſion of the Parliament, how
much theſe treacherous pretences have beene countenanced by ſome e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill
Counſell about his Majeſtie may appeare in this, that the Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
whereby they were declared traytors was ſo long withheld as to
the ſecond of <hi>Ianuary,</hi> though the Rebellion broake forth in <hi>October</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
and then no more but forty Coppies appointed to be printed, with
a ſpeciall command from his Majeſtie not to exceed that number, and
that none of them ſhould be publiſhed till his Majeſties pleaſure were fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſignified, as by the warrant appeares, a true Coppie whereof is here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
added, So that a few only could take notice of it, which was made
more obſerveable, by the late contrary proceedings againſt the Scots;
who were in a very quick and ſharpe manner proclaimed, and thoſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations
forthwith diſperſed, with as much diligence as might bee
thorow all the Kingdome, and ordered to bee read in all Churches, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied
with publique prayers and execrations; another evidence of
favour, and countenance to the Rebells in ſome of power about his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtie
is this, that they have put forth in his Majeſties name, a cauſleſſe
complaint againſt the Parliament; which ſpeaketh the ſame language of
the Parliament which the Rebells doe, thereby to raiſe a beleefe in mens
mindes, that his Majeſties affections are alienated, as well as his perſon
is removed from that his great councell, All which doth exceedingly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tard
the ſupplies of Ireland, and more advance the proceedings of the
Rebells, then any Jealouſie or miſapprehenſion begotten in his Subjects,
by the declaration of the Rebells. Iniunction of <hi>Roſſetti,</hi> or informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of <hi>Treſtram Whitcombe,</hi> ſo that conſidering the preſent ſtate and
temper of both kingdomes, his Royall preſence is farre more neceſſary
here, then it can be in Ireland, for redemption or protection of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
there.<note place="margin">His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtie not charged with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of any force.</note>
            </p>
            <p>And whether there be any cauſe of his Majeſties great indignation for
being reproch'd to have intended force or threatening to the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
We deſire them to conſider who ſhall read our declaration in
which there is no word tending to any ſuch reproach, and certainly wee
have beene more tender of his Majeſties honour in this point, then hee
whoſoever he was that did write this declaration, where in his Majeſties
name, hee doth call God to witneſſe, hee never had any ſuch thought or
knew of any ſuch reſolution of bringing up the Army, which truly, will
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:99643:7"/>
ſeeme ſtrange to thoſe, who ſhall read the depoſition of Maſter <hi>Goring,</hi>
Information of Maſter <hi>Percie,</hi> and divers other examination of Maſter
<hi>Wilmot;</hi> Maſter <hi>Pollard</hi> and others, the other examinations of Captaine
<hi>Legg,</hi> Sir <hi>Iacob Aſhley,</hi> Sir <hi>Iohn Connyers,</hi> and conſider the condition and
nature of the Petition, which was ſent unto Sir <hi>Iacob Aſhley,</hi> under the
approbation of <hi>C. R.</hi> which his Majeſty doth now acknowledge to bee
his owne hand, and being full of ſcandall to the Parliament, might have
proved dangerous to the whole kingdome, if the Army ſhould have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſed
betwixt the King and them, as was deſired.</p>
            <p>We doe not affirme that his Majeſties warrant was granted for the
Paſſage of Maſter <hi>Iermine,</hi>

his Servants, but only that he did paſſe over after that reſtraint by vertue
of ſuch a warrant. We know the warrant beares date the day before our
deſire, yet it ſeemes ſtrange to thoſe who know how great reſpect and
Power Mr. <hi>Iermiae</hi> had in Court, that he ſhould beginne his Journey in
ſuch haſt, and in apparrell ſo unfit for Travaile, as a black Sattin ſuit, and
White Bootes, if his going away were deſigned the day before.</p>
            <p>The Accuſation of the Lord <hi>Kimbolton,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Accuſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Lo. Kim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolton &amp;c.</note> and the five members of the
houſe of Commons is called a breach of priviledge, and truly ſo it was,
and a very high one, farre above any ſatisfaction that hath beene yet gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
how can it be ſaid to be largely ſatisfied, ſo long as his Majeſtie
laboured to preſerve Mr. Attorney from puniſhment; who was the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
Actor in it, ſo long as his Majeſties hath not only Iuſtified him, but
by his letter declared, that it was his duty to accuſe them, and that hee
would have puniſht him, if he had not done it, So long as thoſe members
have not the meanes of cleering their Innocency, and the Authors of
that malitious charge undiſcovered, though both houſes of Parliament
have ſeverall times petition his Majeſtie to diſcover them, &amp; that not only
upon grounds of Common Juſtice, but by Act of Parliament; his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtie
is bound to doe it, ſo long as the King refuſeth to paſſe a Bill for
their diſcharge, alleadging that the Narrative in that Bill, is againſt his
honour, whereby hee ſeemes ſtill to avow the matter of that falſe, and
ſcandalous accuſation, though he deſerts the proſecution, offering to
paſſe a Bill for their acquitall, yet with intimation that they muſt deſert
the avowing their owne innocency, which would more wound them in
honour, then ſecure them in Law.</p>
            <p>And in vindication of this great priviledge of Parliament, wee doe not
know that we have invaded any priviledge belonging to his Majeſtie, as is
alleadged in this declaration.</p>
            <p>But we looke not upon this only in the Notion of a breach of privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:99643:8"/>
which might be, though the accuſation were true, of falſe, but
under the Notion of a haynous crime, in the attorney and all other Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
who had a hand in it, a Crime againſt the law of nature, againſt the
rules of Iuſtice, that innocent men ſhould be charged with ſo great an
offence as Treaſon, in the face of the higheſt Iudicatory of the Kingdome,
whereby their lives and eſtates, their bloud and honour are endangered,
without witnes, without evidence, without all poſſibility of reparation,
in a Legall Courſe, yet a crime of ſuch a nature, that his Majeſties com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
can no more warrant, then it can any other Act of Iniuſtice. it is
true that thoſe things which are evill in their owne nature, ſuch as a falſe
teſtimony or falſe accuſation, cannot be the Subiect of any Command,
or induce any obligation of obedience upon any man, by any authority
whatſoever, therefore the Atturney in this caſe, was bound to refuſe to
execute ſuch a command, unleſſe he had had ſome ſuch evidence or Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
as might have warranted him againſt the parties, and belyable to
make ſatisfaction if it ſhould prove falſe, and it is ſufficiently knowne
to every man, and adiudged in Parliament, that the King can be nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
relater, informer nor witneſſe, if it reſt as it is without further ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
no future Parliament can be ſafe, but that the members may bee
taken, and deſtroyed at pleaſure, yea the very principles of government,
and Juſtice wil bee in danger to bee diſſolved.</p>
            <p>We doe not conceive that numbers doe make an aſſemblie unlawfull,<note place="margin">Tumultu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers.</note>
but when either the end or manner of their Carriage, ſhall be unlawfull,
divers iuſt occaſions might draw the Citizens to Weſtminſter, where ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
publique and private Petitions, and other Cauſes were depending in
Parliament, and why that ſhould bee found more faultie in the Citizens,
then the reſort of great numbers every day in the tearme to the ordinary
Courts of Juſtice we know not; that thoſe Citizens were notoriouſly
provoked and aſſaulted at VVeſtminſter, by Colonell <hi>Limsford,</hi> Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
<hi>Hide,</hi> with divers others, and by ſome of the ſervants of the Arch-Biſhop
of Yorke is ſufficiently proved, and that afterward they were
more violently wounded and moſt barbarouſly mangled with Swords by
the Officers and Souldiers neere <hi>VVhite-Hall,</hi> many of them being with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
weapons, and giving no cauſe of diſtaſt, as is likewiſe proved by
ſeverall teſtimonies, but of any ſcandalous or ſeditious miſdemea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors
of theirs, that might give his Majeſty good cauſe to ſuppoſe his own
perſon or thoſe of his Royall Conſort, or Children to be in appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
danger, we have had no proofe ever offered to either Houſe,
and if there had been any complaint of that kinde, it is nor doubt the
Houſes would have beene as forward to joyne in an order for the

               </gap>g of ſuch Tumults as they were, not long before upon another
occaſion when they made an order to that purpoſe. Whereas thoſe Officers
and Souldiers which committed that violence upon ſo many of the Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens
at <hi>Whitehall,</hi> were cheriſht and foſtred in his Majeſties Houſe, and
when not long after, the Common Councel of <hi>London</hi> preſented a Petition
to his Majeſty, for reparation of thoſe injuries, his Majeſties Anſwer was
(without hearing the proofe of the complainants) that if any Citizen
were wounded or ill intreated, his Majeſty was confidently aſſured, that
it happened by their owne evill and corrupt demeanors.</p>
            <p>We hope it cannot be thought contrary to the du<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>y and wiſedome of a

advertizements from <hi>Rome, Venice, Paris,</hi> and other parts, if the ſolicita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Popes <hi>Nuntio</hi> and our owne diſcontented fugitives, doe make us
jealous and watchfull for the ſafety of the State. And We have beene very
carefull to make our expreſſions thereof, ſo eaſie and ſo plaine, to the capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
and underſtanding of the people, that nothing might juſtly ſtick with
them, with reflection upon the Perſon of his Majeſty. Wherein We ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peale
to the judgement of any indifferent perſon, who ſhall read and peruſe
our owne Words.</p>
            <p>We muſt maintaine the ground of our feares, to be of that moment, that
We cannot diſcharge the truſt and duty which lyes upon us, unleſſe Wee
doe apply our ſelves to the uſe of thoſe meanes, to which the Law hath en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled
us in caſes of this nature, for the neceſſary defence of the Kingdom,
and as his Majeſty doth graciouſly declare the Law ſhall be the Meaſure of
his power, ſo doe We moſt heartily profeſſe, that We ſhall alwayes make
it the rule of our obedience.</p>

               <p>The next poynt of our Declaration was with much caution artificially
paſſed over by him who drew his Majeſties Anſwer, it being indeed the
foundation of all our miſery and his Majeſties trouble, that he is pleaſed
to heare generall taxes upon his Parliament, without any particular
charge to which they may give ſatisfaction, &amp; that he hath often conceived
diſpleaſure againſt particular perſons upon miſinformation, &amp; although
thoſe informations have bin clearly proved to be falſe, yet he would never
bring the accuſers to queſtion, which layeth an impoſſibility upon honeſt
men of clearing themſelves, and gives incouragement unto falſe and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
perſons to trouble him with untrue and groundleſſe informati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.

               <p>We ſo earneſtly deſire his Maieſties returne to <hi>London</hi> that upon it, we

therefore we muſt proteſt, that as for the time paſt, neither the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

ſay anything that nay ſtand with the duty or honour of a Parliament,
which may raiſe a mutuall confidence betwixt his Maieſty and us, as wee
doe wiſh, and as the affaires of the Kingdome doe require.</p>
               <p>Thus far the Anſwer to that which is called his Maieſties Declaration
hath led us, now we come to that which is Intituled his Maieſties An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
to the Petition of both Houſes, preſented to him at <hi>Yorke.</hi> the
26 of <hi>March,</hi> 1642. In the beginning whereof, his Maieſty wiſheth that
<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> Privileges on all parts wee ſo Stired, that this way of correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:99643:9"/>
might be preſerved, with that freedome which hath beene uſed of
old; we know nothing introduced by us, that gives any impediment here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto,
neither have we affirmed our Priviledges to be broken, when his
Maieſty denies us any thing, or gives a reaſon why he cannot grant it, or
that thoſe who adviſed ſuch denyall were enemies to the peace of the
Kingdome, and favourers of the Iriſh Rebellion, in which aſperſion, that
is turned into a general aſerſion, which in our Votes is applyed to a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
caſe, wherefore we muſt maintaine our Votes, that thoſe who ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed
his Maieſty to contradict that which in both Houſes in the Queſtion
concernig the Militia, had declared to be Law, and command it ſhould
not be obeyed, is a high breach of priviledge, and that thoſe who adviſed
his Maieſty to abſent himſelfe from his Parliament, are enemies to the
peace of the Kingdome, and iuſtly to be ſuſpected to be favourers of the
Rebellion in <hi>Ireland</hi> the reaſons of both are evident, becauſe in the firſt,
there is as great a derogation from the truſt and authority of Parliament;
and in the ſecond, as much advantage to the proceedings and hopes of
the Rebels, as may be, and we hold it a very cauſeleſſe imputation upon
the Parliament, that we have herein any way impeacht, much leſſe taken
away the freedome of his Majeſties Vote, which doth not import a liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
for his Majeſty to deny any thing, how neceſſary ſoever for the preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of the Kingdome, much leſſe a Licence to evill Counſellors, to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe
any thing though never ſo deſtructive to his Majeſty, and his
people.</p>
               <p>By the Meſſage of the twentieth of <hi>Ianuary,</hi> his Majeſty did propound
to both Houſes of Parliament, that they would with all ſpeed fall into a
ſerious conſideration of all thoſe particulars which they thoght neceſſary
as well for the upholding and maintaining his Majeſties juſt and Regall
authority, and for the ſetling his Revenue, as for the preſent and future
eſtabliſhing our Priviledges, the free and quiet enjoying our eſtates, the
Liberties of our Perſons, the ſecurity of the true Religion profeſſed in
the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and the ſetling of Ceremonies in ſuch a manner as
may take away all juſt offence, and to dig<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſt it into one entire body.</p>
               <p>To that point of upholding and maintaining his Royall authority, We
ſay nothing hath been done to the prejudice of it, that ſhould require
any new proviſion; To the other of ſetling the revenue, the Parliament
hath no way abridged or diſordered his juſt revenue, but it is true that
much waſt and confuſion of his Majeſties eſtate hath beene made by thoſe
evill and unfaithfull Miniſters whom he hath imployed in the managing
of it, whereby his owne ordinary expences would have beene diſappoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and the ſafety of the Kingdome more endangered, if the Parliament
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:99643:10"/>
had not in ſome meaſure provided for his Houſehold, and for ſome of the
Forts, more then they were bound to doe, and they are ſtill willing to
ſettle ſuch a revenue upon his Majeſtie as may make him live Royally,
plentifully and ſafely, but they cannot in wiſdome and fidelity to the
Common-Wealth, doe this, till he ſhall chuſe ſuch Counſellours and
Officers as may order and diſpoſe it to the pablicke good, and not apply
it to the ruine and deſtruction of his people as heretofore it hath beene,
but this and the other matters concerning Our ſelves, being workes of
great importance, and full of intricacie, will require ſo long a time of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberation,
that the Kingdome might be ruined before Wee ſhould ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
them, wherefore We thought it neceſſary, firſt to be ſuitors to his
Majeſtie ſo to order the Militia, that the Kingdome being ſecured, Wee
might with more caſe and ſafety apply our ſelves to debate of that Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage
wherein We have beene interrupted by his Majeſties denyal of the

(except for Corporations) onely that hee denyed the way, to
which We anſwer, that that exception takes off <hi>London,</hi> and all other

deſires to know the griefes of his Subjects, and to redreſſe inormities,
The last day of the Parliament the King demanded of the whole Eſtates,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:99643:10"/>
whether they would have ſuch things as they agreed on, by way of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance
or Statute, who Anſweared by way of Ordinance, for that
they might amend the ſame at their pleaſures, and ſo it was.</p>
               <p>But his Majeſtie objects further, that there is ſomewhat in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face,
to which he could not conſent with Juſtice, to his honour and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence,
and that thereby he is excluded from any power in the diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
of it: theſe objections may ſeeme ſomewhat, but indeed will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare
nothing, when it ſhall be conſidered, that nothing in the Preamble
layes any charge upon his Majeſtie, or in the body of the Ordinance,
that excludes his Royall Authority in the diſpoſing or execution of it,
But onely it is provided that it ſhould be ſignified by both Houſes of
Parliament, as that channell through which it will be beſt derived, and
moſt certainely, to thoſe ends for which it is intended, and let all the
world judge, whether Wee have not reaſon to inſiſt upon it, that the
ſtrength of the Kingdome ſhould rather be ordered according to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
or advice of the great Councell of the Land, equally intruſted
by the King and by the Kingdome, then that the ſafety of the King,
Parliament and Kingdome ſhould bee left at the devotion of a few un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne
Counſellours, many of them not intruſted at all by the King in
any publike way, nor at all conſided in by the Kingdome.</p>
               <p>We wiſh the danger were not imminent, or not ſtill continuing, but
cannot conceive that the long time ſpent in this debate is evidence
ſufficient, that there was no ſuch neceſſity or danger, but a Bill might ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilie
have bin prepared, for when many cauſes doe concurre to the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of a State, the interruption of any one may hinder the execution of
the reſt, and yet the deſigne be ſtill kept on foot for better oportunities:
who knowes whether the ill ſucceſſe of the Rebels in Ireland hath not
hindred the inſurrection of the Papiſts here? whether the preſervation
of the ſix Members of the Parliament, falſely accuſed, hath not preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
that plot of the breaking the neck of the Parliament, of which wee
were informed from France, not long before they were accuſed? yet ſince
his <hi>Maieſty</hi> hath bin pleaſed to expreſſe his pleaſure, rather for a Bill
then an Ordinance, and that he ſent in one for that purpoſe, wee readily
entertained it, and with ſome ſmall and neceſſary alterations, ſpeedily
paſſed the ſame: But contrary to the cuſtome of Parliament, and our
expectation grounded upon his Maieſties owne invitation of us to that
way, and the other reaſons manifeſted in our Declaration, concerning the

to Law, we hope his Maieſtie will allow the Subiects to be bound
by them, becauſe he hath ſaid he will make the Law the Rule of
his Power, and if the queſtion be whether that bee Law which the
Lords and Commons have once declared to be ſo, who ſhall be the
Iudge? Not his Maieſty, for the King iudgeth not of matters of
Law, but by his Courts, and his Courts, though ſitting by his
authority, expect not his Aſſent in matters of Law, not any other
Courts, for they cannot Iudge in that caſe becauſe they are Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour,
no appeale lying to them from Parliament, the Iudgement
whereof is in the eye of the Law, the Kings Iudgement in his

We know the King hath wayes enough in his ordinary Courts
of juſtice to puniſh ſuch ſeditious Pamphlets and Sermons as are
any way prejudiciall to his Rights, Honour, &amp; authority; and if
any of them have beene ſo inſolently violated and vilified, his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties
owne Councell and Officers have been too blame, and not
the Parliament; we never did reſtraine any proceedings of that
kind in other Courts, nor refuſe any fit complaint to us. The
Proteſtation Proteſted was referred by the Commons Houſe to a
Committee, and the Author being not produced, the Printer
committed to priſon, and the Booke voted by that Committee, to
be burnt; but Sir <hi>Edward Dcering</hi> who was to make that report
of the Votes of that Committee, neglected to make it; The
Apprentizes Proteſtation was never complained of, but the other
ſeditious Pamphlet, To your Tents oh <hi>Iſrael</hi> was once queſtioned
and the full proſecution of it was not interrupted by any fault of
either Houſe, whoſe forwardneſſe to doe his Majeſty all right,
therein may plainely appeare, in that a Committee of Lords and
Commons was purpoſely appoynted to take ſuch informations
as the Kings Councell ſhould preſent, concerning ſeditious words,
practiſes or tumults, Pamphelets or Sermons, tending to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogation
of his Majeſties Rights, or Prerogative; and his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell
were enjoyned by that Committee, to enquire and preſent
them, who ſeverall times met thereupon, and received this
Anſwer and Declaration from the Kings Councell, that they knew
of no ſuch thing as yet.</p>
               <p>If his Majeſty had uſed the ſervice of ſuch a one in penning
this Anſwer, who underſtood the Lawes, and government of this
Kingdome, hee would not have thought it legally in his
power to deny his Parliament a guard, when they ſtood in
need of it, ſince everie ordinary Court hath it; neither
would his Majeſtie, if he had beene well informed of the
Lawes, have refuſed a guard as they deſired, it being in the
power of inferior Courts to command their owne guard, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
would he have impoſed upon them ſuch a guard under a
Commander, which they could not confide in; which is clearely
againſt the Priviledges of Parliament, and of which they found
very dangerous effects, and therefore deſired to have it diſcharged;
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:99643:12"/>
But ſuch a guard and ſo commanded, as the Houſes of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
deſired, they could never obtain of his Majeſtie, and
the placing of a guard about them contrary to their deſire,
was not to grant a guard to them, but in effect to ſet one upon
them: All which conſidered, we beleeve in the judgements of
any indifferent perſons, it will not be thought ſtrange if there
were a more then ordinarie reſort of people at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> of
ſuch as came willingly of their own accord to be witneſſes and
helpers of the ſafetie of them whom all his Majeſties good ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
are bound to defend from violence and danger: or that
ſuch a concourſe as this, they carrying themſelves quietly and
peaceably (as they did) ought in his Majeſties apprehenſion,
or can in the interpretation of the Law, be held tumultuarie
and ſeditious.</p>
               <p>When <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>as Majeſtie in that queſtion of violation of the Laws
had expreſſed the obſervation of them indefinitely without
any limitation of time, although we never ſaid or thought
any thing that might look like a reproach to his Majeſtie,
yet we had reaſon to remember that it had been otherwiſe;
leſt we ſhould ſeem to deſert our former Complaints and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings:
thereupon as his Majeſtie doth ſeem but little to like
or approve of them: for although he doth acknowledge here
that great miſchief that grew by that arbitrary power then
complained of, yet ſuch are continually preferred and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenanced
as were friends or favourers, or related unto the chief
Authors and Actors of that Arbitrarie Power, and of thoſe
falſe colours, ſuggeſtions of imminent danger and neceſſitie,
whereby they did make it plauſible unto his Majeſtie; and on
the other ſide, ſuch as did appeare againſt them, are daily diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countenanced
and diſgraced: which whileſt it ſhall be ſo, we
have no reaſon to judge the diſeaſe to be yet killed and dead
at root; and therefore no reaſon to bury it in oblivion. And
whileſt we behold the Spawnes of thoſe miſchievous Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
cheriſht and foſtered in that new generation of Councel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours,
friends and Abettors of the former, or at leaſt concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
with them in their malignancie againſt the proceedings
of this Parliament, we cannot think our ſelves ſecure from the
like or a worſe danger.</p>
               <p>And here the Penner of this Anſwer beſtows an admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:99643:13"/>
upon the Parliament, bidding us take heed we fall not
upon the ſame errour, upon the ſame ſuggeſtions: but he
might have well ſpared this, till he could have ſhewed where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
we had exerciſed any power otherwiſe then by the rule of
the Law, or could have found a more authentique or a higher
Judge in matters of Law, then the high Court of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>It is declared in his Majeſties name, that he is reſolved to
keep the rule himſelf, and to his power to require the ſame of
all others: we muſt needs acknowledge that ſuch a reſolution
is like to bring much happineſſe and bleſſing to his Majeſtie,
and all his Kingdoms; yet with humilitie we muſt confeſſe,
we have not the fruit of it, in that Caſe of my Lord <hi>Kimbolton,</hi>
and the other five Members accuſed contrary to Law, both
Common Law, and the Statute Law, and yet remaineth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatisfied;
which Caſe was remembred in our Declaration as a
ſtrange and unheard of violation of our Laws: But the Penner
of this Anſwer thought fit to paſſe it over, hoping that many
would read his Majeſties Anſwer, which hath been ſo care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
diſperſed, which would not read our Declaration.</p>
               <p>Whereas after our ample thanks, and acknowledgement of
his Majeſties favour in paſſing many good Bills, we ſaid that
truth and neceſſitie inforced us to adde this, that in or about
the time of paſſing thoſe Bills, ſome deſigne or other hath
been a foot; which if it had taken effect, would not onely have
deprived us of the fruit of thoſe Bils, but would have reduced
us to a worſe condition of confuſion, then that wherein the
Parliament found us. It is now told us that the King muſt be
moſt ſenſible of what we caſt upon him, for requitall of thoſe
good Bills, whereas out of our uſuall Tenderneſſe of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties
Honour, we did not mention him at all: but ſo injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
are thoſe wicked Councellours to the name and Honour
of their Maſter and Soveraigne, that as much as they can
they lay their own infamy and guilt upon his Shoulders.</p>
               <p>Here God alſo is called to witneſſe His Majeſties upright in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions
at the paſſing of thoſe Laws; this we will not queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
neither did we give any occaſion of ſuch a ſolemne aſſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
as this is: The devill is likewiſe defied to prove there
was any defigne with His Majeſties knowledge or privitie;
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:99643:13"/>
This might well have been ſpared, for we ſpake nothing of
his Majeſtie; But ſince we are ſo far taxed as to have it affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
that we laid a notorious and falſe imputation upon His
Majeſtie, we have thought it neceſſarie for the juſt defence of
our own innocencie, to cauſe the oaths and examinations
which have been taken concerning the deſigne to be publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in a full Narration, for ſatisfaction of all His Majeſties ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
out of which we ſhall now offer ſome few particulars,
whereby the world may judge whether we could have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
with more tenderneſſe toward His Majeſtie then we
have done. Maſter <hi>Goreing</hi> confeſſeth, that the King firſt ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him whether he were ingaged in any Caball concerning the
Army, and commanded him to joyn with Maſter <hi>Piercy</hi> and
Maſter <hi>Jermyn,</hi> and ſome other whom they ſhould find with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
at Maſter <hi>Peircy's</hi> Chamber, where they took the oath of
ſecrecie, and then debated of a deſigne propounded by Maſter
<hi>Jermyn</hi> to ſecure the Tower, and to conſider of bringing up
the Army to <hi>London,</hi> and Captain <hi>Legg</hi> confeſſed, he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
the draught of a Petition in the Kings preſence, and His
Majeſtie acknowledgeth it was from His own hand; and who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
reads the ſumme of that Petition, as it was proved by
the Teſtimony of Sir <hi>Jacob Aſhley,</hi> Sir <hi>John Conyers,</hi> and Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<hi>Legg,</hi> will eaſily perceive ſome points in it apt to beget
in them ſome diſcontent againſt the Parliament. And can
any man beleeve there was no deſigne in the accuſation of the
Lord <hi>Kimbolton</hi> and the reſt, in which His Majeſtie doth
avow himſelf to be both a Commander and an Actor: theſe
things being ſo, it will eaſily appear to be as much againſt the
rules of Prudence, that the Penner of this Anſwer ſhould en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangle
His Majeſtie in this unneceſſarie Apologie; as it is
againſt the rules of Juſtice, that any reparation from us ſhould
be either yeelded, or demanded.</p>
               <p>It is profeſſed in His Majeſties name, that he is truly ſenſible
of the Burthens of His people, which makes us hope that he
will take that courſe which will be moſt effectuall to eaſe them
of theſe burthens, that is, to joyn with his Parliament in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving
the peace of the Kingdom, which by his abſence from
them hath been much endangered, and which by hindring the
voluntarie Adventures for recovery of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and diſabling
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:99643:14"/>
the Subjects to diſcharge the great tax laid upon them, is like
to make the war much more heavie to the Kingdom. And
for His Majeſties wants, the Parliament have been no cauſe of
them, we have not diminiſhed His juſt Revenue, but have
much eaſed His publique Charge, and ſomewhat his private.
And we ſhall be readie, in a Parliamentary way, to ſettle His
revenue in ſuch an Honorable proportion, as may be anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to both, when he ſhall put himſelf into ſuch a poſture of
Government, that His Subjects may be ſecure to enjoy His
juſt protection, for their Religion, Laws, and Liberties.</p>
               <p>We never refuſed His Majeſties gracious offer of a free and
Generall Pardon, onely we ſaid it could be no ſecuritie to our
preſent fears and jealouſies: And we gave a reaſon for it, that
thoſe fears did not ariſe out of any guilt of our own Actions,
but out of the evill deſignes and attempts of others; and we
leave it to the world to judge, whether we herein have deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
ſo heavie a Tax and exclamation (that it was a ſtrange
world when Princes proffered favours are counted reproaches,
ſuch are the words of His Majeſties Anſwer) who do eſteeme
that offer as an Act of Princely grace and bountie, which ſince
this Parliament began we have humbly deſired we might ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
and do ſtill hold it very neceſſarie and advantagious for
the generalitie of the Subject, upon whom theſe Taxes and
Subſidies lie heavieſt, but we ſee upon every occaſion how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happie
we are in His Majeſties miſapprehenſions of our words
and actions.</p>
               <p>We are fully of the Kings mind as it is here declared, that he
may reſt ſo ſecure of the affections of His Subjects, that he
ſhould not ſtand in need of forraigne force to preſerve him
from oppreſſion, and are confident that he ſhall never want an
abundant evidence of the good wiſhes and aſſiſtance of His
whole Kingdom, eſpecially if he ſhall be pleaſed to hold to
that gracious reſolution of building upon that ſure founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
the Law of the Land: but why His Majeſtie ſhould take
it ill, that we having received informations ſo deeply concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the ſafetie of the Kingdom, and ſhould think them fit to
be conſidered of, we cannot conceive; for although the name
of the perſon was unknown, yet that which was more ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiall
to the probabilitie of the Report was known (that is)
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:99643:14"/>
That he was ſervant to the Lord <hi>Digby,</hi> who in his preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
Letter to the Queenes Majeſty, and other Letters to Sir
<hi>Lewis Dives,</hi> had intimated ſome wicked Propoſition ſutable
to that Information, but that this ſhould require reparation,
wee hold it as farre from Juſtice as it is from truth, that wee
have mixt any malice with theſe rumours, thereby to feed
the feares and jealouſies of the People.</p>
               <p>It is affirmed his Majeſtie is driven (but not by us yet) from
us, perchance hereafter if there be opportunity of gaining more
credit, there will not be wanting who will ſuggeſt unto his
Majeſtie, that it is done by us. And if his Majeſtie were dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
from us, wee hope it was not by his owne feares, but by
the feares of the Lord <hi>Digbie,</hi> and his retinue of Cavaliers,
and that no feares of any Tumultuary violence, but of their
juſt puniſhment for their manifold inſolence and intended vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
againſt the Parliament. And this is expreſſed by the
Lord <hi>Digby</hi> himſelfe, when he told thoſe Cavaliers, that the
principall cauſe of his Majeſties going out of Towne was to
ſave them from being trampled in the durt; but of his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties
perſon there was no cauſe of feare in the greateſt heate of
the peoples indignation after the accuſation, and his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties
violent comming to the Houſe, there was no ſhew of
any evill intention againſt his Regall Perſon, of which there
can be no better evidence then this, that he came the next day
without a Guard into the Citie, where he heard nothing but
Prayers and Petitions, no threatnings or irreverent ſpeeches,
that might give him any juſt occaſion of feare, that wee have
heard of, or that his Majeſtie expreſt; for he ſtayed neere a
weeke after at <hi>White Hall,</hi> in a ſecure and peaceable condition,
whereby wee are induced to beleeve, that there is no difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
nor doubt at all, but his Majeſties reſidence neere <hi>London</hi>
may be as ſafe as in any part of the Kingdome: We are moſt
aſſured of the faithfulneſſe of the Citie and Suburbes; And
for our ſelves wee ſhall quicken the vigour of the Lawes, the
induſtry of the Magiſtrate, the authoritie of Parliament, for
the ſuppreſſing of all tumultuary inſolencies whatſoever, and
for the vindicating of his Honour from all inſupportable and
inſolent ſcandalls, if any ſuch ſhall be found to be rayſed upon
him, as are mentioned in this Anſwer, and therefore wee
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:99643:15"/>
thinke it altogether unneceſſary and exceeding inconvenient
to adjourne the Parliament to any other place.</p>
               <p>Where the deſire of a good underſtanding betwixt the King
and the Parliament, is on both parts ſo earneſt as is here pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt
of his Majeſtie to be in him, and wee have ſufficiently te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified
to be in our ſelves, it ſeemes ſtrange wee ſhould be ſo
long aſunder, it can be nothing elſe but evill and malicious
Councell, miſrepreſenting our carriage to him, and in diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
his favour to us, and as it ſhall be farre from us to take
any advantage of his Majeſties ſuppoſed ſtraits, as to deſire
much leſſe to compell him to that which his Honour or inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt
may render unpleaſant and grievous to him, ſo wee hope
that his Majeſtie will not make his owne underſtanding or
reaſon the rule of his Government, but will ſuffer himſelfe to
be aſſiſted with a wiſe and prudent Councell, that may deale
faithfully betwixt him and his people; And that he will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
that his reſolutions doe concerne Kingdomes, and
therefore ought not to be moulded by his owne, much leſſe by
any other private perſon, which is not alike proportionable to
ſo great a truſt, and therefore we ſtill deſire and hope that
his Majeſty will not be guided by his owne underſtanding, or
to thinke thoſe Courſes ſtraights and neceſſities, to which he
ſhall be adviſed by the Wiſdome of both Houſes of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
which are the Eyes in this Politique Body, whereby
his Majeſtie is by the Conſtitution of this Kingdome to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne
the differences of thoſe things which concerne the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
peace and ſafetie thereof.</p>
               <p>Wee have given his Majeſtie no cauſe to ſay, that wee doe
meanly value the diſcharge of His publique dutie, whatſoever
Acts of Grace or Juſtice have been done, they proceeded from
his Majeſtie by the advice and Councell of his Parliament;
yet wee have and ſhall alwayes anſwer them with conſtant
gratitude, obedience, and affection; and although many things
have been done ſince this Parliament of another nature, yet
wee ſhall not ceaſe to deſire the continued protection of All<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie
God upon His Majeſtie. And moſt humbly Petition
him to caſt from him all thoſe evill and contrary Councells
which have in many particulars formerly mentioned, much
detracted from the Honour of his Government, the happineſſe
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:99643:15"/>
of his owne Eſtate, and proſperitie of his people.</p>
               <p>And having paſt ſo many dangers from abroad, ſo many
Conſpiracies at home, and brought on the publique worke ſo
farre, through the greateſt difficulties that ever ſtood in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
to a Parliament, to ſuch a degree of ſucceſſe, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
ſeemes to be left in our way able to hinder the full ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment
of our deſires and endeavours for the publique
good; unleſſe God in his juſtice, doe ſend ſuch a grievous
Curſe upon us, as to turne the ſtrength of the Kingdom againſt
it ſelfe, and to effect that by their owne folly and credulitie,
which the Power and Subtiltie of their and our enemies could
not attaine, That is, to divide the people from the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and to make them ſerviceable to the ends and aimes of
thoſe, who would deſtroy them. Therefore wee deſire the
Kingdome to take notice of this laſt moſt deſperate and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous
Plott of the malignant partie, that is acted and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted
in many parts of the Kingdom, under plauſible Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
of ſtirring them up to a care of preſerving the Kings Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative,
maintaining the Diſcipline of the Church, uphold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and continuing the reverence and ſolemnitie of Gods Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
incouraging of Learning. And upon theſe grounds, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
mutinous Petitions have been framed in <hi>London, Kent,</hi> and
other Counties, and ſundry of his Majeſties Subjects have
been ſollicited to declare themſelves for the King, againſt the
Parliament: and many falſe and foule aſperſions have been
caſt upon our proceedings, as if wee had been not onely neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent,
but averſe in theſe points: whereas wee deſire nothing
more, then to maintaine the puritie and power of Religion,
and to Honour the King in all His juſt Prerogatives: and for
encouragement and advancement of pietie and learning, wee
have very earneſtly endeavoured, and ſtill doe to the utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
of our Power, that all Pariſhes may have learned, pious,
and ſufficient Preachers, and all ſuch Preachers competent
Livings.</p>
               <p>Many other Bills and Propoſitions are in preparation for the
Kings Profit and Honour, the peoples ſafetie and proſperitie,
In the proceedings whereof, wee are much hindred by His
Majeſties abſence from the Parliament, which is altogether
contrary to the uſe of his Predeceſſors, and the Priviledges of
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:99643:16"/>
Parliament, whereby ou<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

overcome all this at laſt, if the people ſuffer not themſelves to
be deluded with falſe and ſpecious ſhewes, and ſo drawne to
betray us to their owne undoing, who have ever been wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling

            <p>HE ſaith,<note place="margin">To the firſt Int.</note> That in <hi>Lent</hi> laſt (as he remembers) about
the middle of it, Sir <hi>John Suckling</hi> came to him on
<hi>Sonday</hi> morning as he was in his bed: And this Examinate concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
he had come to him about ſome buſineſſe of money that was
between them; and thereupon falling upon that diſcourſe, Sir
<hi>John Suckling</hi> told him he was then come about another buſineſſe,
which was to acquaint him, That there was a purpoſe of bringing
the Army to <hi>London,</hi> And that my Lord of <hi>New-caſtle</hi> was to be
Generall, and he this Examinate, Lievtenant Generall, if he would
accept of it. And further ſaid, That he ſhould hear more of this bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe
at Court: to which this Examinate anſwered only this, Well,
then I will go to the Court; which was all that paſſed between
them at that time, to the beſt of this Examinates remembrance.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>To the ſecond,</hi> He cannot depoſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>To the third,</hi> He ſaith, That as he was coming in his Coach in
the ſtreet, out of the <hi>Covent-Garden</hi> into S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Martins Lane,</hi> he met

this Examinate, ſent his Foot-man to him, deſiring him to follow
him, becauſe he would ſpeak with him; which this Examinate did:
And M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Jermyn</hi> going a little further, alighted, and went into a
houſe (to which houſe, as this examinate was but yeſterday in
formed, Sir <hi>John Suckling</hi> did then uſually reſort) and thither this
Examinate followed him; and coming after him to the top of the
Seayr<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>s, M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Jermyn</hi> ſaid to him, He had ſomewhat to ſay to him
concerning the Army, but that this was no fit place to ſpeak of it,
and deſired him to meet him that evening at the Court, on the
Queens ſide; which this Examinate accordingly did; and meeting
M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Jermyn</hi> in the Queens drawing Chamber, he was there told by
him, That the Queen would ſpeak with him, and thereupon M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>
               <hi>Jermyn</hi> brought him into the Queens Bed-chamber: But before
this Examinate could enter into any diſcourſe with the Queen, the
King came in, and then this Examinate did withdraw, and went
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:99643:17"/>
away for that time, but returned again the ſame night, and met
M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Jermyn</hi> again on the Queens ſide, who told him that he muſt
neceſſarily meet with ſome Officers of the Army, to hear ſome
Propoſitions concerning the Army. The next day, being <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day,</hi>
this Examinate came again to the Court in the after-noon, and
went into the Queens drawing-Chamber, <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>here Her Majeſty then
was, who was pleaſed to tell him that the King would ſpeak with
him, and bade him repair to the room within the Gallery, into
which Room the King ſoon after came; and His Majeſty asked
him if he was engaged in any Cabale concerning the Army: to
which he anſwered, That he was not: whereupon His Majeſty
replyed, I command you then to joyn your ſelf with <hi>Peircy,</hi> and
ſome others whom you will finde with him. And His Majeſty
likewiſe ſaid, I have a deſire to put my Army into a good poſture,
and am adviſed unto it by my Lord of <hi>Briſtoll:</hi> which was the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
of what paſſed between the King and this Examinate at that
time. This Examinate meeting afterwards with M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Jermyn,</hi> M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>
               <hi>Jermyn</hi> told him that they were to meet that evening at nine of the
Clock with M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Peircy,</hi> and ſome others, at M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Peircyes</hi> Chamber;
and accordingly M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Jermyn</hi> and he went thither together, and
there found Mr <hi>Peircy</hi> himſelf, M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Wilmot,</hi> M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Aſhburnham,</hi> M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>

               <hi>Peircy</hi> then in the firſt
place tendered an Oath to this Examinate and M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Jermyn,</hi> the reſt
ſaying they had taken that Oath already: this Oath was prepared
in writing, and was to this effect, <hi>That they ſhould neither directly
nor indirectly diſcloſe any thing of that which ſhould be then ſaid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
them, nor think themſelves abſolved from the ſecrecy enjoyned by this
Oath, by any other Oath which ſhould be afterwards taken by them:</hi>
They having taken the Oath, M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Peircy</hi> declared, That they were
were reſolved not to admit of any body elſe into their Councells:
And M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Jermyn</hi> and this Examinate moved that Sir <hi>John Suckling</hi>
might be received amongſt them; which being oppoſed by the
reſt, after ſome debate, it was laid aſide: And ſome ſpeech there
was of Sir <hi>Iohn Suckling</hi> his being employed in the Army; but how
it was agreed upon, this Examinate doth not remember.</p>
            <p>After this, M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Piercy</hi> made his Propoſitions, which he read out
of a paper, which were to this effect, That the Army ſhould pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
be put into a poſture to ſerve the King, and then ſhould ſend
up a Declaration to the Parliament, of theſe particulars, <hi>viz.</hi> That
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:99643:17"/>
nothing ſhould be done in Parliament contrary to any former Act
of Parliament, which was explayned, That Biſhops ſhould be
maintained in their Votes and Functions, And the Kings Revenue
be eſtabliſhed. From theſe Propoſitions none of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Percyes</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
did declare themſelves to diſſent. Then came into conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation,
if the Army ſhould not immediately be brought to <hi>London,</hi>
which, as this Examinate remembers, was firſt propounded by M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>
               <hi>Jermyn,</hi> and alſo the making ſure of the Tower. Theſe things
this Examinate did urge, to ſhew the vanity and danger of the
other Propoſitions, without undertaking this. In the concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
this Examinate did proteſt againſt his having any thing to do
in either deſigne; for the proof of which, he appeals to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences
of them that were preſent, and ſo parted with them.
About this buſineſſe this Examinate ſaith, That they had two meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
and cannot diſtinguiſh what paſſed at the one, and what at
the other, but the reſult of all was as he formerly declared: further
then which, he cannot depoſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>To the fourth Int.</hi> He can ſay no more then he hath already
ſaid.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>To the fifth Int.</hi> He ſaith, That the very day that Sir <hi>Iohn Suck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling</hi>
firſt moved this unto him, he gave ſome touch of it to my Lord
<hi>Dungarvan:</hi> and the day after his ſecond meeting at M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Peircyes</hi>
Chamber, he diſcovered it to my Lord of <hi>Newport,</hi> and defined him
to bring him to ſome other Lords, ſuch as might be likelieſt to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
all miſchief: And accordingly the next day my Lord of <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port</hi>
brought him to my Lord of <hi>Bedford,</hi> my Lord <hi>Say,</hi> and my
Lord <hi>Mandevill,</hi> to whom he imparted the main of the buſineſſe,
but not the particulars, in regard of his Oath; and deſired them
to make uſe of it as they ſhould ſee cauſe, for the ſafety of the
Common-wealth, but not to produce him, nor name any perſon,
except there were a neceſſity for it. He further ſaith, That he did
at the ſame time make a Proteſtation unto thoſe Lords, of his fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
unto the Common-wealth, and of his readineſſe to run all ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards
for it.</p>

            <p>WHat with my own innocency and the violence I heare is againſt

becauſe it may bring prejudice upon you; but I will with
all faithfulneſſe and truth tell you what my part hath been, that
at leaſt I may be cleered by you whatſoever becomes of me.</p>
            <p>When there was 50000 pound deſigned by the Parliament for the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh
Army, there was as I take it a ſudden demand made by the Scots at
the ſame time of 25000 pound, of which there was but 15000 pound ready,
this they preſſed with ſo much neceſſity as the Parliament after an Order
made, did think it fit for them to deduct 10000 pound out of the fifty for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
granted, upon which, the ſouldiers in our houſe were more ſcandali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed,
amongſt which I was one, and ſitting by Wilmott and Aſhburnham,
Wilmott ſtood up and told them, if ſuch papers as that of the Scots would
procure monies, he doubted not but the Officers of the Engliſh Army
might eaſily do the like, but the firſt order was reverſed notwithſtanding,
and the 10000 pound give to the Scots; this was the cauſe of many diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes
of diſlike amongſt us, and came to this purpoſe, that they were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obliged
by the Parliament; and not by the King, this being ſaid often one
to another, we did reſolve, that is, Wilmott, Aſhburnham, Pollard,
Oneale, and my ſelfe to make ſome expreſſion of ſerving the King in all
things he would command us, that were honourable for him and us, being
likewiſe agreeable to the fundamentall lawes of the kingdome, that ſo farre
we ſhould live and dye with him. This was agreed upon by us, not having
any communication with others, that I am coupled now withall; and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
by their joynt conſent I was to tell his Majeſty thus much from them;
but withall I was to order the matter ſo, as that the King might apprehend
this as a great ſervice done unto him, at this time when his affaires were in
ſo ill a condition, and they were moſt confident that they could ingage the
whole Army thus farre, but farther they would undertake nothing, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they would neither infringe the liberties of the Subject, or deſtroy
the Lawes, to which I and every one conſented; and having their ſence, I
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:99643:18"/>
drew the Heads up in a paper, to which they all approved when I read it;
and then we did by an oath promiſe to one another to be conſtant and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
in all this, and did all of us take that oath together. Well Sirs, I muſt
now be informed what your particular deſires are, that ſo I may be the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
able to ſerve you, which they were pleaſed to do, and I did very
faithfully ſerve them therein, as farre as I could: this is the truth and all
the truth upon my ſoule. In particular diſcourſes after that, we did fall
upon the petitioning the King and Parliament for money, there being ſo
great arreares due to us, and ſo much delayes made in the procuring of
them, but that was never done.</p>
            <p>The preſerving of Biſhops functions and votes.</p>
            <p>The not disbanding of the Iriſh Army, untill the Scots were disban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
too.</p>
            <p>The endeavouring to ſettle his revenew to that proportion it was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly,
and it was reſolved by us all, if the King ſhould require our aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance
in theſe things, that as farre as we could, we might contribute
thereunto without breaking the Lawes of the kingdome, and in caſe the
King ſhould deny theſe things being put to them, we would not fire from him.</p>
            <p>All theſe perſons did act and concurre in this as well as I. This being
all imparted to the King by me from them, I perceived he had been trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with by others concerning ſomething of our Army, which did not
agree with what we propoſed, but enclined a way more high and ſharpe
not having limits either of Honour or Law, I told the King he might be
pleaſed to conſider with himſelfe, which way it was fit for him to hearken
unto. For us, we were reſolved not to depart from our grounds, and if he
imployed others we ſhould not be diſpleaſed whoſoever they were: but
the particulars of their deſigne, or the perſons, we deſired not to know,
though it was no hard matter to gueſſe at them; in the end I believe the
dangers of the one, and the juſtice of the other, made the King tell me he
would leave all thoughts of other propoſitions but ours, as things not pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cticable,
but deſired notwithſtanding that Goring and <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ermine, who were
acquainted with the other proceedings, ſhould be admitted amongſt us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
I told him, I thought the other Gentlemen would never conſent to it, but
I would propoſe it; which I did, and we were all much againſt it; but the
King did preſſe it ſo much, as at the laſt, it was conſented unto, and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
and jermine came to my chamber, there I was appointed to tell
them, after they had ſworne to ſecrecy, what we had propoſed which I
did: but before I go on to the debate of the wayes, I muſt tell you, Mr.
Jermine and Goring were very earneſt Suckling ſhould be admitted, which
we did all decline; and I was deſired by all our men to be reſolute in it,
which I was, and gave many reaſons; whereupon I remember M. Goring
made anſwer, he was ſo ingaged with Suckling<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he could not go or do any
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:99643:19"/>
thing without him. Yet in the end, ſo that we would not oppoſe Suckling
his being imployed in the Army, that for his meeting with us they were
contented to paſſe it by. Then we took up againe, the wayes were propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
which took a great debate, and theirs (<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">

               </gap> will ſay) differed from ours in
violence, and height, which we all proteſted againſt and parted, diſagreeing
totally; yet remitting it to be ſpoken of by me, and Jermine, to the King
which we both did. And the King conſtant to his former reſolution told
him, that all thoſe wayes were vaine and fooliſh, and would think of them
no more. I omitted one thing of M. Goring, he deſired to know, how the
chiefe Commanders were to be diſpoſed of, for if he had not a condition
worthy of him, he would not go along with us, we made anſwer that no
body had thought of that, we intending if we were ſent downe, to go all
in the ſame capacity we were in, he did not like that by no means, and
upon that did work ſo by M. Chidley, that there was a Letter ſent by ſome
of the Commanders to make him Lievtenant Generall: and when he had
ordered this matter at London, and M. Chidley had his inſtructions, then
did he go to Portſmouth pretending to be abſent when this was a work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
we all deſired my Lord of Eſſex or my Lord of Holland, and they (if
there were a Generall) Newcaſtle, They were pleaſed to give out a report I
ſhould be Generall of the Horſe; but I proteſt, neither to the King or any
elſe did I ever ſo much as think of it: my Lord of Holland was made Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
and ſo all things were laid aſide: and this is the truth, and all the truth
I know of all theſe proceedings; and this I do and will proteſt upon my
faith; and Wilmote, Aſhburnham, and Oneale, have at ſeverall times
confeſſed and ſworne, I never ſaid any thing in this buſineſſe, they did not
every one agree unto, and would juſtifie. This relation I ſend you, rather
to informe you of the truth of the matter, that you may know the better
how to do me good: But I ſhould thinke my ſelfe very unhappy to be
made a betrayer of any body; what concerned the Tower or any thing elſe
I never medled withall, nor never ſpoke with Goring, but that night be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
them all; and I ſaid nothing but what was conſented unto by all my
party. I never ſpoke one word to Suckling, Carnarvan, Davenant, or
other creature: me thinkes if my friends and kindred knew the truth and
juſtice of this matter, it were no hard matter to ſerve mee in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.</p>

The Examination of Captain James Chudleigh.</head>
            <p>To the firſt Interogatory, and to the ſecond;</p>
            <p>THis Deponent ſaith, That about March and April laſt
he was at Burrowbrig, where divers Officers and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders
of the Army met, to whom he uſed ſome
ſpeeches concerning the Parliament, that he ſaw no
pr<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap>lity that the Army would be ſuddenly paid by the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
becauſe they had promiſed ſo much to the King, and to the
Scots, as well as to the Army; but that the King did commiſerate
their caſe, and ſaid, That if they would be faithfull to him, he
would pawn his Iewels rather then they ſhould be unpaid; and
ſaith further, That he knows of ſuch a Letter ſent by the Army to
my Lord of Northumberland, to be ſhewed to the Parliament;
and that he told them at that meeting, that the Parl<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> was much
diſpleaſed with that Letter, and that thoſe who had ſubſcribed it
ſhould be ſent for up particularly, that my Lord of Eſſex, and my
Lord of Newport had expreſſed much diſlike of that Letter, and of
them who had ſent it, and ſaid, that they had forfeited their necks:
which he had from Sir Iohn Suckling, Maſter Davenant, and (as he
conceives) from Sergeant Major Willis: And this he declared to
thoſe Officers, as giving them an account of his journey, and the
ſervice in which they had imployed him.</p>
            <p>To the third Interogatory;</p>
            <p>He ſaith he hath anſwered before.</p>
            <p>To the fourth Interogatory;</p>
            <p>That Sergeant Major Willis told him upon the way, as they
were in their journey down into the North, that Colonell Goring
was a brave Gentleman, and fit to command the Army, and that
the King had a good inclination to him, that he ſhould be Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
Generall; and ſaith further, that before he came out of Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,
Sir Iohn Suckling had likewiſe highly commended him, and
ſaid he was fitter to command in chief, then any man he knew,
and that the Army was not now conſiderable, being without a
head, and indeed was but a party (Colonell Goring being away)
who commanded a Brigado, and that they did undiſcreetly to ſhew
their teeth except they could bite, which the ſaid Sir Iohn Suck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
wiſhed him to declare unto the Army, ſaying, He could not do
a better ſervice to the Officers who had imployed him, then to let
them know it, wherupon he did acquaint them with it accordingly.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:99643:20"/>
To the fifth Interogatory;</p>
            <p>That Sir Iohn Suckling brought him into ſome-room of the
Queens ſide at White Hall, where Maſter Iermyn and he had pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
conference together, and oftentimes looked towards this
Deponent: Sir Iohn Suckling afterwards told him, that the King
would be well pleaſed if the Army would receive Colonell Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
to be their Lieutenant Generall, and ſaid that Maſter Henry
lermyn ſaid ſo.</p>
            <p>To the ſixth Interogatory;</p>
            <p>That Maſter Davenant told him, that things were not here as
they were apprehended in the Army, for that the Parliament was
ſo well affected to the Scots, as that there was no likelyhood the
Army ſhould have ſatisfaction ſo ſoon as they expected it.</p>
            <p>To the ſeventh Interogatory;</p>
            <p>That when he brought the Letter from the Army, he met vvith
Maſter Davenant, vvho told him it vvas a matter of greater con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence
then he imagined, and thereupon brought him to Maſter
Henry Iermyn, and Maſter Iermyn told him he heard he brought
ſuch a Letter, and asked to ſee a copy of it, vvhich this Deponent
did ſhevv unto him, and Maſter Iermyn asked if he might not
ſhevv it to the Queen, and offered to bring this Deponent to her,
vvhich he excuſed himſelf of, leſt he ſhould have anticipated my
Lord Generall from ſhevving the Letter firſt himſelf.</p>
            <p>To the eighth Interogatory;</p>
            <p>That after he had brought up that Letter, he ſtaid ſome 8 or 9
dayes in London, before he returned dovvn to the Army.</p>
            <p>To the ninth Interogatory:</p>
            <p>That Sergeant Major VVillis told him moſt of the noble Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen
in England would ſhevv themſelves for the Army: And
that the French that vvere about London vvould receive Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders
from them, to joyn vvith them: And beſides, that there
vvould a thouſand horſe likevviſe be raiſed to come to their aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
vvhich horſe at laſt he confeſſed vvere to be found by the
Clergy.</p>
            <p>To the tenth Interogatory;</p>
            <p>That Sergeant Major Willis ſaid moreover, that the Army
vvould be very vvell kept together, for that the Prince vvas to be
brought thither, vvhich vvould confirm their affections: vvhich
this Deponent did declare at Burrovvbrig unto the Officers, and
doth beleeve Willis did the like; and V<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap>llis told them alſo, that
if my Lord of Nevvcaſtle vvas their Generall, he vvould feaſt them
in Nottinghamſhire, and vvould not uſe them roughly, but that
they ſhould be governed by a Councell of vvar.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:99643:20"/>
To the eleventh Inter.</p>
            <p>That both Serjeant Major <hi>Willis</hi> and this Deponent, did perſwade
the Officers at that meeting, to write a Letter to Colonell <hi>Goring,</hi>
which was to let him know, that they would heartily embrace him
to be their Lievtenant Generall, if it was his Majeſties pleaſure to
ſend him downe, which Letter was ſubſcribed by Colonell <hi>Fielding</hi>
and Colonell <hi>Vavaſour,</hi> and divers others; and was by him brought
to London upon Monday, where not finding Colonell <hi>Goring;</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
it to Sir <hi>Iohn Sucklin,</hi> who carried it to the King, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
brought him to kiſſe the King and Queenes hand, and within
a day or two returned the Letter to him againe, which Letter this
Deponent the Saturday after carried downe himſelfe to Colonell
<hi>Goring</hi> to Portſmouth.</p>
            <p>To the 12 Inter.</p>
            <p>That there was likewiſe a Letter written to Mr. <hi>Endimion Porter,</hi>
aſſigned by Colonell <hi>William <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>avaſour</hi> and Colonell <hi>Fielding,</hi> which
was to this effect, to deſire him to informe his Majeſtie, that the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
was very faithfull to him, and no doubt need be made by his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtie
concerning their proceedings. This Letter Sir <hi>Iohn Sucklin</hi>
would not have to be delivered, but took it himſelfe, for that he ſaid
Mr. <hi>Porter</hi> knew nothing of the Kings intentions.</p>
            <p>To the 14 Inter.</p>
            <p>That when he came to Portſmouth, Colonell <hi>Goring</hi> ſhewed him
the ſtrength of that place, and told him, that if there ſhould bee any
mutiny in London, the Queene meant to come downe thither for
her ſafetie, and that ſhe had ſent him downe money to fortifie it.</p>
            <p>To the 15 Inter.</p>
            <p>That what he learned from Serjeant Major <hi>Willis,</hi> he got from him
by degrees, as he urged it from him by way of diſcourſe; and that
<hi>Willis,</hi> Sir <hi>Iohn Sucklin,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Davenant,</hi> did all of them give him
great charge to keep things ſecret, and to be very carefull to whom
he communicated any thing, which he accordingly obſerved; for he
dealt with the Officers there ſeverally.</p>

ſome thing out of a paper, which he read, and told them that hee

it from the King. And hee ſaid likewiſe, that ſome others about the

            <p>THat he did meet at Burrowbridge, being ſent to by Captain <hi>Chid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley,</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:99643:21"/>
That Mr. <hi>Chidley</hi> did propound to him certaine propoſitions, which as
he affirmed, hee did receive from Mr. <hi>Henry Iermyn,</hi> and from another
great man which he might not name. Captaine <hi>Chidley</hi> further ſaid, that
M. <hi>Iermyn</hi> told him that he received thoſe propoſitions from the King: But
<hi>Chidley</hi> told him further, that when he kiſſed the Kings hand, his Majeſtie
ſaid nothing to him of any ſuch propoſitions. The firſt propoſition was
That he ſhould not acquaint either Sir <hi>Iacob Aſhely,</hi> or Sir <hi>Iohn Conyers,</hi>
with any thing of this deſigne. The ſecond, that if there were occaſion, the
Army ſhould remove their Quarters into Nottingham-ſhire, where the
Prince and the Earle of New-Caſtle ſhould meet them with a thouſand
Horſe, and all the French that were in London ſhould bee mounted, and
likewiſe meet them. Theſe propoſitions were read by Captaine <hi>Chidley,</hi>
out of a paper, which hee ſaid he had written himſelfe, thinking to have
ſent them downe; but upon better conſideration hee brought them
downe himſelfe. That they likewiſe ſhould deſire, that Colonell <hi>Gering</hi>

a Paper to this effect, as hee was then told, That if the King would

him; which Paper he, this Examinant, refuſed to read, or to ſet his hand
to it: but heard that divers others ſigned it. He further ſaith, that there
was no other Paper propounded to him to be ſigned, nor to any other to
his knowledge. Hee further ſaith, that this was not delivered to the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers

            <p>He likewiſe ſaith, That preſently after Colonell <hi>Vavaſour</hi> ſaid publike<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that hee never conſented to theſe propoſitions in his heart; and deſired
that there might be a meeting immediately, whereupon they agreed upon
a meeting at York the Wedneſday following, at which meeting they ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally

<date>the 30. of October, 1641.</date>
            </head>
            <p>To the firſt Interrg.</p>
            <p>SAith, That hee doth know Maſter <hi>Daniel Oneale</hi> who was Serjeant
Major to Sir <hi>Iohn Conniers,</hi> doth not certainely remember the preciſe
time going from the Army to London, nor of his return back, but beleeves
he returned about <hi>Iune</hi> and <hi>Iuly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To the ninth.</p>
            <p>That hee was at Yorke when the ſaid Maſter <hi>Oneale</hi> returned thither
from London, and can ſay no more to this ninth Interrg.</p>
            <p>To the tenth.</p>
            <p>That there was a Petition prepared to bee delivered to the parliament
from the Army, which conſiſted of many particulars, as to ſhew how
much they ſuffered for want of Martiall Law, and for want of pay, and
becauſe their principall Officers were not amongſt them, ánd they did
likewiſe ſet forth in it, That as the wiſedome of the King did cooperate
with the Parliament, So they did hope the Parliament would doe ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
concerning the Kings Revenue; but ſaith he doth not remember what
the particular was which was deſired, and further that they heard of great
tumults about London, and therefore offered themſelves to ſerve the King
and Parliament: with the laſt drop of their bloods. He ſaith that this Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition
was approved of by all the Officers that ſaw it, but was laid aſide till
further conſideration ſhould be had of the manner of the delivery, That
himſelfe was afterwards ſent for to London by order of the houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
and was examined, and after his examination, when hee ſaw there
was no further uſe to bee made of that Petition hee burnt it.</p>
            <p>Hee farther ſaith, That he ſtaid in this Towne ſome five or ſixe dayes,
and was with the King, and had ſome ſpeech with His Majeſty about a
Petition to come from the Army, and gave him an accompt of the Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that was formerly burnt, and there he received another Petition to the

but what thoſe Letters were, he will not ſay nor cannot ſwear who
writ thoſe two Letters, becauſe hee did not ſee them written.</p>
            <p>He ſaith he did deliver the ſame paper with the directions to Sir <hi>Iacob

            <p>HEe ſaith that he hath known Serjeant Major <hi>Daniel Oneal</hi> very long
and that he was long abſent from the Army the laſt Sommer, but

            <p>He ſaith that Mr. <hi>Oneale</hi> told him after his comming downe laſt, that
things being not ſo well betwixt the King and Parliament, hee thought a
Petition from the Army might doe very much good, and asked him if a
draught of ſuch a Petition were brought unto him, whether he would ſet his
hand unto it, the particulars which he deſired to have the Army received
in, were the want of Martiall Law, want of pay, and for words ſpoken in
the Houſe of Parliament againſt the Army, as that the City was diſaffect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

tenour whereof as far as remembers was to this effect, the Letter beeing
written in two ſides of paper and ſomewhat more, firſt that divers things
were preſſed by parties to inſafe into the Parliament things to the Kings
diſadvantage, and that divers tumults and diſorders were neere the parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament

in this Letter, and in the cloſe of this Letter, it was recommended to
this Examinat that he ſhould get the hands of the Officers of the Army to
ſuch a declarat on to be ſent to the Parliament, and that this would bee
acceptable to the King. Hee further ſaith, hee knowes not of whoſe hand
writing it was nor who delivered it to Captaine <hi>Legg.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To the 7. Inter.</p>
            <p>He ſaith that Mr. <hi>Oneal</hi> telling him of the diſlikes which were between
the King and the Parliament and of thoſe things which were done to
the diſadvantage of the King, they muſt fight with the Scots firſt and
beate them before they could move Southward; and that done, they
muſt ſpoyle the Countrey all along as they goe, and when they doe
come to London, they would finde reſiſtance by the Parliament and
the Scots might rallie and follow them: to which <hi>Oneale</hi> replyed, what
if theſe Scots could bee made neutrall: This Examinat then ſaid, that
the Scots would lay him by the heels, if he ſhould come to move ſuch a
thing, for that they would never breake with the Parliament.</p>
            <p>Preſently replyed; I wondred that Counſells ſhould be ſo laid as had

approve of it, but that as yet there were but few hands to that Petition,

concerning Martiall Law, and better payment for the Army, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

               <hi>To the fifth,</hi> That the paper mentioned in his former examination to
have beene ſecne by him in Sir <hi>Iacobs Aſhleys</hi> hand, contained directions
for a Petition to be preſented to the King and Parliament: In which,
was a clauſe to this effect, That whereas all men ought to give God
thanks, for putting it into the Kings heart, to condiſcend to the deſires of
the Parliament, not only to deliver up unto them many of his ſervants
and others, who were neere unto him to bee at their diſpoſing, but alſo
to doe many things, which none of his Anceſtors would have conſented
unto, as giving way to the Triannuall Parliament: and granting many
other things for the good of his Subjects, yet not withſtanding ſome tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulent
ſpirits, backt by rude and tumultuous mechanick perſons, ſeemed
not to be ſatisfied, but would have the totall ſubverſion of the government
of the State, that therefore the Army, which was ſo orderly governed,
not withſtanding they had no martiall Law, and ill payment, and but
few Officers, being of ſo good comportment, might be called up to attend
the perſon of the King and Parliament for their ſecurity. This Examinant
further ſaith, that there were many other paſſages in this Petition which
he doth not now remember, only that there was ſome expreſſion of a
deſire, that both Armies ſhould bee disbanded for the caſe of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome;
and likewiſe a direction to procure as many of the Officers hands,
as could be gotten.</p>

about that time when Commiſſary <hi>Wilmot</hi> and the other Souldiers were

               <hi>To the ſecond.</hi> That the ſaid <hi>O-Neale</hi> perſwaded him this Examinant to

and <hi>Anne Bardſey</hi> of Tower-ſtreet aforeſaid widow, ſay, that
they being deſirous to ſee the Earle of <hi>Strafford,</hi> came to <hi>Anne Vyner</hi>
wife of <hi>Thomas Vyner</hi> Clerk to the Lievtenant of the Tower, whoſe lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
being neare to the Kings Gallery, where the ſaid Earl uſeth to walk,
carried them to a back doore of the ſaid Gallery, the ſaid Earl with one
other being then walking. And they three being then there, and peeping
through the key hole and other places of the doore to ſee the ſaid Earle,
did heare him and the ſaid other party conferring about an eſcape, as they
conceived, ſaying, that it muſt be done when all was ſtill, and asked the
ſaid party where his brothers ſhip was, who ſaid ſhe was gone below in
the River, and heard him ſay, that they three might be there in twelve
houres, and doubted not to eſcape if ſome thing which was ſaid concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the Lievtenant of the Tower, were done; but what that was, as
alſo where they might be in twelve houres, they could not heare by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
that when they walked further off, they could not perfectly heare.
And the ſaid Ms <hi>Nutt</hi> and Ms <hi>Bardſey</hi> ſay, that they heard the ſaid Earl
then ſay, that if this Fort could be ſafely guarded or ſecured for three or
foure months, there would come aid enough: and divers other words
tending to the purpoſes aforeſaid, which they cannot now remember.</p>
            <p>And further all of them ſay that they heard the ſaid Earle, three times
mention an eſcape, ſaying, that if any thing had been done, his Majeſty
might ſafely have ſent for him; but now there was nothing to be thought
on, but an eſcape: And heard the ſaid other partie telling his Lordſhip, that
the outward gates were now as ſurely guarded as thoſe within. To whom
the ſaid Earle ſaid, the eaſier our eſcape that way, pointing to the Eaſt,
if the ſaid party and ſome others ſhould obey the directions of the ſaid
Earle: But what thoſe were they know not; but heard the ſaid party
anſwer, they would doe any thing his Lordſhip ſhould command.</p>

            <p>I Hope you will have received the Letter which I wrote unto you from
aboard Sir <hi>John Pennington,</hi> wherein I gave you account of the acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
of <hi>O-Neals</hi> man, and why I thought fitting to continue my journey
into Holland; going ſtill upon this ground, that if things goe on by way
of accommodation, by my abſence the King will be advantaged: If the
King declare himſelf, and retire to a ſafe place, I ſhall be able to wait up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him from hence, as well as out of any part of England, over and above
the ſervice which I may doe him here in the mean time. Beſides that, I
found all the Ports ſo ſtrict, that if I had not taken this opportunity of Sir
<hi>John Peningtons</hi> forwardneſſe in the Kings ſervice, it would have been
impoſſible for me to have gotten away at any other time.</p>
            <p>I am now here at Middle borough, at the Golden Fleece upon the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket,
at one <hi>George Peterſons</hi> houſe, where I will remaine till I receive
from you advertiſement of the ſtate of things, and likewiſe inſtructions
from their Majeſties; which I deſire you to haſten unto me by ſome ſafe
hand: and withall to ſend unto me a cypher, whereby we may write un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
one another freely. If you knew how eaſie a paſſage it were, you
would offer the King to come over for ſome few dayes your ſelfe. God
knowes I have not a thought towards my Countrey to make me bluſh,
much leſſe criminall; but where Traytors have ſo great a ſway, the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſteſt

            <p>Let <hi>Dick Sherley</hi> be diſpatcht hither ſpeedily, with ſuch black cloaths
and linnen as I have: and let your letters be directed to the Baron of

            <p>WHo being duly ſworne and examined, ſaith, That he being at
Mommore in the County of London-Derry on Tueſday laſt,
he received a Letter from Colonell <hi>Hugh Ogemacmahon,</hi> deſiring him to
come to Connagh in the County of Monayhan, and to be with him on
Wedneſday or Thurſday laſt: whereupon he this Examinant came to
Connagh on Wedneſday night laſt, and finding the ſaid <hi>Hugh</hi> come to
Dublin, followed him hither: He came hither about ſix of the clock this
Evening, and forthwith went to the lodging of the ſaid <hi>Hugh,</hi> to the houſe
neer the Boot in Oxmantowne, and there he found the ſaid <hi>Hugh,</hi> and
came with the ſaid <hi>Hugh</hi> into the towne, neere the Pillory, to the lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Lord <hi>Mac-quire;</hi> where they found not the Lord within: and
there they dranke a cup of Beere, and then went back again to the ſaid
<hi>Hugh</hi> his lodging. He ſaith that at the Lord <hi>Mac-quire</hi> his lodging the
ſaid <hi>Hugh</hi> told him that there were and would be this night great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of Noblemen and Gentlemen of the Iriſh Papiſts, from all the parts
of the Kingdome, in this Towne, who with himſelfe had determined to
take the Caſtle of Dublin, and poſſeſſe themſelves of all his Majeſties
Ammunition there; and to morrow morning being Saturday: and that
they intended firſt to batter the Chimneyes of the ſaid Towne; and if the
City would not yeeld, then to batter down the houſes, and ſo to cut off
all the Proteſtants that would not joyne with them.</p>
            <p>He ſaith further, That the ſaid <hi>Hugh</hi> then told him, that the Iriſh had
prepared men in all parts of the Kingdom, to deſtroy all the Engliſh in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habiting
there to morrow morning by ten of the clock; and that in all
the Sea-ports, and other Townes in the Kingdome, all the Proteſtants
ſhould be killed this night; and that all the Poſts that could bee could
not prevent it. And further ſaith, That he moved the ſaid <hi>Hugh</hi> to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare
the executing of that buſineſſe, and to diſcover it to the State for the
ſaving of his owne eſtate: who ſaid, that he could not help it: But ſaid,
that they did owe their due allegeance to the King, and would pay him
all his Rights, but that they did this for the tyrannicall Government was
over them; and to imitate Scotland, who got a priviledge by that courſe.
And he further ſaith, That when he was with the ſaid <hi>Hugh</hi> in his lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the ſecond time, the ſaid <hi>Hugh</hi> ſwore that he ſhould not goe out of
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:99643:28"/>
his lodging that night, but told him that he ſhould goe with
him the next morning to the Caſtle, and ſaid, if this matter
were diſcovered, ſome body ſhould die for it: Whereupon
this Examinant feigned ſome neceſſity for his eaſement, went
downe out of the Chamber, and left his ſword in pawne, and
the ſaid <hi>Hugh</hi> ſent his man downe with him; And when this
Examinant came downe into the yard, finding an opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
he this Examinant leaped over a wall and two pales, and
ſo came to the Lord Juſtice <hi>Parſons.</hi>
